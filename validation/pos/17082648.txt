Chemokines and their receptors play a key role in immune homeostasis regulating
leukocyte migration, differentiation, and function. Viruses have acquired and
optimized molecules that interact with the chemokine system. These virus-encoded 
molecules promote cell entry, facilitate dissemination of infected cells, and
enable the virus to evade the immune response. One such molecule in the murine
gammaherpesvirus 68 genome is the M3 gene, which encodes a secreted 44-kDa
protein that binds with high affinity to certain murine and human chemokines and 
blocks chemokine signaling in vitro. To test the hypothesis that M3 directly
interferes with diverse chemokines in vivo, we examined the interaction of M3
with CCL2 and CXCL13 expressed in the pancreas of transgenic mice. CCL2
expression in the pancreas promoted recruitment of monocytes and dendritic cells;
CXCL13 promoted recruitment of B and T lymphocytes. Coexpression of M3 in the
pancreas blocked cellular recruitment induced by both CCL2 and CXCL13. These
results define M3 as multichemokine blocker and demonstrate its use as a powerful
tool to analyze chemokine biology.
