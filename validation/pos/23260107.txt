Canine distemper virus (CDV) was shown to use dog nectin-4 as a receptor to gain 
entry into epithelial cells. RNA from dog placenta or MDCK kidney cells was
isolated and cDNAs were prepared. Two splice variants of dog nectin-4 were
identified. A deletion of 25 amino acids was found in the cytoplasmic domain of
dog nectin-4 from MDCK cells, corresponding to a splice variant that is also seen
in murine nectin-4, and did not affect its role as a receptor. Both dog nectin-4 
and human nectin-4 could function as an entry factor for CDV containing an EGFP
reporter gene. Inhibition of dog nectin-4 expression by RNAi or nectin-4
antibodies decreased CDV titers and EGFP fluorescence. Finally, dog nectin-4 also
promotes syncytia formation, which could be inhibited by siRNA treatment. These
data confirm that dog nectin-4 can be used by CDV to gain entry into epithelial
cells, and facilitate virus spread.
