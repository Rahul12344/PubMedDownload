During lytic infections, the virion host shutoff (Vhs) protein (UL41) of herpes
simplex virus destabilizes both host and viral mRNAs. By accelerating mRNA decay,
it helps determine the levels and kinetics of viral and cellular gene expression.
In vivo, Vhs shows a strong preference for mRNAs, as opposed to non-mRNAs, and
degrades the 5' end of mRNAs prior to the 3' end. In contrast, partially purified
Vhs is not restricted to mRNAs and causes cleavage of target RNAs at various
sites throughout the molecule. To explain this discrepancy, we searched for
cellular proteins that interact with Vhs using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
two-hybrid system. Vhs was found to interact with the human translation
initiation factor, eIF4H. This interaction was verified by glutathione
S-transferase pull-down experiments and by coimmunoprecipitation of Vhs and
epitope-tagged eIF4H from extracts of mammalian cells. The interaction was
abolished by several point mutations in Vhs that abrogate its ability to degrade 
mRNAs in vivo. The results suggest that Vhs is a viral mRNA degradation factor
that is targeted to mRNAs, and to regions of translation initiation, through an
interaction with eIF4H.
