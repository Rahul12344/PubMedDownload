The primary role of cytoplasmic viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is
viral genome replication in the cellular cytoplasm. However, picornaviral RdRp
denoted 3D polymerase (3D(pol)) also enters the host nucleus, where its function 
remains unclear. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of viral attack in 
which 3D(pol) enters the nucleus through the nuclear localization signal (NLS)
and targets the pre-mRNA processing factor 8 (Prp8) to block pre-mRNA splicing
and mRNA synthesis. The fingers domain of 3D(pol) associates with the C-terminal 
region of Prp8, which contains the Jab1/MPN domain, and interferes in the second 
catalytic step, resulting in the accumulation of the lariat form of the splicing 
intermediate. Endogenous pre-mRNAs trapped by the Prp8-3D(pol) complex in
enterovirus-infected cells were identified and classed into groups associated
with cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Our results suggest that
picornaviral RdRp disrupts pre-mRNA splicing processes, that differs from viral
protease shutting off cellular transcription and translation which contributes to
the pathogenesis of viral infection.
