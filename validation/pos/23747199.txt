Adenovirus E1A induces cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation and promotes 
viral replication through interaction with p300/CBP, TRRAP/p400 multi-protein
complex and the retinoblastoma (pRb) family proteins through distinct domains in 
the E1A N-terminal region. The C-terminal region of E1A suppresses E1A/Ras
co-transformation and interacts with FOXK1/K2, DYRK1A/1B/HAN11 and CtBP1/2 (CtBP)
protein complexes. To specifically dissect the role of CtBP interaction with E1A,
we engineered a mutation (DL→AS) within the CtBP-binding motif, PLDLS, and
investigated the effect of the mutation on immortalization and Ras cooperative
transformation of primary cells and viral replication. Our results suggest that
CtBP-E1A interaction suppresses immortalization and Ras co-operative
transformation of primary rodent epithelial cells without significantly
influencing the tumorigenic activities of transformed cells in immunodeficient
and immunocompetent animals. During productive infection, CtBP-E1A interaction
enhances viral replication in human cells. Between the two CtBP family proteins, 
CtBP2 appears to restrict viral replication more than CtBP1 in human cells.
