Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) have been shown to block human
immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus. It is hypothesized that CDKIs
block viral replication by inhibiting transcription of specific cellular genes.
Here we find that three CDKIs, flavopiridol, purvalanol A, and
methoxy-roscovitine, block Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) transcription
events. Using gene expression microarray technology to examine the inhibitory
effects of CDKIs, we observed a cellular gene, the pre-B-cell leukemia
transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) gene, down-regulated by CDKI treatment. The PBX
consensus element (PCE), TGATTGAC, is conserved in the long terminal repeats of
several murine retroviruses, including Moloney MLV. Mutations in the PCE
completely inhibited viral transcription whereas overexpression of PBX1 and a
PBX1-associated protein, PREP1, enhanced viral transcription. The interaction
between the PCE and PBX1-PREP1 proteins was confirmed by gel shift experiments.
Blocking PBX1 protein synthesis resulted in a significant decrease in viral
transcription. Collectively, our results represent the first work demonstrating
that the homeodomain proteins PBX1 and PREP1 are cellular factors involved in
Moloney MLV transcription regulation.
