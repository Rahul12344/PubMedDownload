Several members of the chemokine receptor family are used together with CD4 for
HIV-1 entry into target cells. T cell line-tropic (T-tropic) HIV-1 viruses use
the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as a co-receptor, whereas macrophage-tropic
(M-tropic) primary viruses use CCR5 (refs 2-6). Individuals with defective CCR5
alleles exhibit resistance to HIV-1 infection, suggesting that CCR5 has an
important role in vivo in HIV-1 replication. A subset of primary viruses can use 
CCR3 as well as CCR5 as a co-receptor, but the in vivo contribution of CCR3 to
HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis is unknown. HIV-1 infects the central nervous
system (CNS) and causes the dementia associated with AIDS. Here we report that
the major target cells for HIV-1 infection in the CNS, the microglia, express
both CCR3 and CCR5. The CCR3 ligand, eotaxin, and an anti-CCR3 antibody inhibited
HIV-1 infection of microglia, as did MIP-1beta, which is a CCR5 ligand. Our
results suggest that both CCR3 and CCR5 promote efficient infection of the CNS by
HIV-1.
