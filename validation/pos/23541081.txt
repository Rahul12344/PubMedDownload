Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ORF75c contains ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and
requires PML SUMOylation but not other known cellular PML regulators, CK2 and
E6AP, to mediate PML degradation.

All gammaherpsviruses encode at least one gene related to the cellular
formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGARAT) enzyme but their
biological roles are relatively unknown. The murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68)
vFGARAT, ORF75c, mediates a proteasome-dependent degradation of the antiviral
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein by an unknown mechanism, which is addressed 
in this study. We found that ORF75c interacts weakly with PML and SUMO-modified
forms of PML are important for its degradation by ORF75c. ORF75c-mediated PML
degradation was not dependent on two known cellular regulators of PML stability, 
Casein kinase II (CK2) and human papilloma virus E6-associated protein (E6AP).
Finally, ORF75c had self-ubiquitination activity in vitro and its expression
increased levels of ubiquitinated PML in transfected cells. Taken together, the
evidence accumulated in this study provides new insights into the function of a
vFGARAT and is consistent with a model in which ORF75c could mediate direct
ubiquitination of PML resulting in its degradation by the proteasome.
