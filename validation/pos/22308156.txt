BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major causative agent of acute clinical 
hepatitis in adults throughout much of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The
lack of an efficient cell culture system for HEV has greatly limited our
understanding of the mechanisms of infection, replication, and pathogenicity of
this virus. The yeast two-hybridization system is considered to be an efficient
method for determining protein-protein interactions and screening interactive
proteins associated with host cells.
OBJECTIVES: In order to identify the host-cell proteins interacting with the
HEV-capsid proteins, a fragment of the HEV-capsid protein p239 (amino acids
368-606) was used as bait; human liver cDNA library was used as a source of
host-cell proteins, and the screening was performed using the CytoTrap yeast
two-hybrid system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system, which is also called
Sos Recruitment System (SRS), was used to analyze the interaction of the p239
fragment with host-cell proteins.
RESULTS: We isolated 2 proteins, cytochrome P4502C8 (CYP4502C8) and
retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) after 2 rounds of screening.
Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that both the proteins could bind in vitro
to the HEV virion in HepG2 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP4502C8 and RBP4 screened from liver cDNA library using the
CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system interact with HEV capsid in vitro.
