Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, highly contagious animal disease caused
by FMD virus (FMDV). Although FMDV-induced immunosuppression in host has been
well established, the exact molecular mechanism for such induction is not very
clear. We report here the identification of FMDV VP1 as an interferon-suppressor 
by interacting with soluble resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin). 
We found that VP1 suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or Sendai virus
(SeV)-induced type I interferon response in HEK293T cells, and that this
suppression could be completely abolished by knockdown of sorcin by shRNA.
Furthermore, overexpression of sorcin inhibited type I interferon response.
Conversely, TNF- or SeV-induced type I interferon response increased when sorcin 
knocked down, leading to inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
replication. Thus, VP1-induced suppression of type I interferon is mediated by
interacting with sorcin, a protein that appears to regulate cell response to
viral infections.
