BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus-encoded X protein has been shown to be capable of
activating many different viral and cellular promoters through protein-protein
interactions and to contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. As
its mechanism has not yet been identified unequivocally, the aim of the present
study was to screen the cellular proteins that can interact with X protein.
METHODS: The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen the X-interactive
protein. False positive clones were eliminated by segregation analysis, and then 
putative positive clones were amplified, sequenced and analyzed with
bioinformatics. A mating experiment was performed to confirm the binding of
putative proteins to X protein in the yeast cells. The specific interaction
between X protein and putative proteins in mammalian cells was verified by
coimmunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: The hepatitis B virus X-interactive protein recovered from a human liver
cDNA library was cytochrome C oxidase III. The specific interaction between
protein X and cytochrome C oxidase III was verified by mating experiment and
coimmunoprecipitation of COS7 cell lysates expressing both proteins.
CONCLUSION: These data support the speculation that cytochrome C oxidase III is a
novel functional target of hepatitis B virus X protein in cells.
