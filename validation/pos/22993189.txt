RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) converts
adenosine (A) to inosine (I) residues in dsRNA templates. While ADAR-1-mediated
editing was essentially described for RNA viruses, the present work addresses the
issue for two δ-retroviruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 and simian
T-cell leukemia virus type 3 (HTLV-2 and STLV-3). We examined whether ADAR-1
could edit HTLV-2 and STLV-3 virus genomes in cell culture and in vivo. Using a
highly sensitive PCR-based method, referred to as 3DI-PCR, we showed that ADAR-1 
could hypermutate adenosine residues in HTLV-2. STLV-3 hypermutation was obtained
without using 3DI-PCR, suggesting a higher mutation frequency for this virus.
Detailed analysis of the dinucleotide editing context showed preferences for 5'
ArA and 5' UrA. In conclusion, the present observations demonstrate that ADAR-1
massively edits HTLV-2 and STLV-3 retroviruses in vitro, but probably remains a
rare phenomenon in vivo.
