Picornavirus infection can lead to disruption of nuclear pore traffic, shut-off
of cell translation machinery, and cleavage of proteins involved in cellular
signal transduction and the innate response to infection. Here, we demonstrated
that the FMDV 3C(pro) induced the cleavage of nuclear RNA-binding protein Sam68
C-terminus containing the nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Consequently, it
stimulated the redistribution of Sam68 to the cytoplasm. The siRNA knockdown of
Sam68 resulted in a 1000-fold reduction in viral titers, which prompted us to
study the effect of Sam68 on FMDV post-entry events. Interestingly, Sam68
interacts with the internal ribosomal entry site within the 5' non-translated
region of the FMDV genome, and Sam68 knockdown decreased FMDV IRES-driven
activity in vitro suggesting that it could modulate translation of the viral
genome. The results uncover a novel role for Sam68 in the context of
picornaviruses and the proteolysis of a new cellular target of the FMDV 3C(pro).
