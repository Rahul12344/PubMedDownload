Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL), and the viral oncoprotein Tax plays key roles in the
immortalization of human T cells, lifelong persistent infection, and
leukemogenesis. We herein identify the ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) as 
a Tax-interactor in HTLV-1-infected T cells. USP10 is an antistress factor
against various environmental stresses, including viral infections and oxidative 
stress. On exposure to arsenic, an oxidative stress inducer, USP10 is recruited
into stress granules (SGs), and USP10-containing SGs reduce reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and inhibit ROS-dependent apoptosis. We found that
interaction of Tax with USP10 inhibits arsenic-induced SG formation, stimulates
ROS production, and augments ROS-dependent apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T cells. 
These findings suggest that USP10 is a host factor that inhibits stress-induced
ROS production and apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T cells; however, its activities 
are attenuated by Tax. A clinical study showed that combination therapy
containing arsenic is effective against some forms of ATL. Therefore, these
findings may be relevant to chemotherapy against ATL.
