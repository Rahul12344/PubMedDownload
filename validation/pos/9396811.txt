We have shown that human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) gene expression is
negatively regulated by the U5 repressive element (U5RE) of its long terminal
repeat (LTR). To isolate factors binding to U5RE, we screened a cDNA expression
library by south-western blotting with a U5RE probe. Screening 2 x10(6) clones
gave a positive clone with a 3.8 kb insert encoding a novel 671 residue
polypeptide, named HTLV-I U5RE binding protein 1 (HUB1), with five zinc finger
domains and a Kr端ppel-associated box like domain; HUB1 may be related to a
repressor belonging to the Kr端ppel type zinc finger protein. A 4.0 kb mRNA for
HUB1 is ubiquitously expressed among all human tissues tested. HUB1 recognizes
the TCCACCCC sequence as a core motif and exerts a strong repressive effect on
HTLV-I LTR-mediated expression. A new repressive domain, named HUB1 repressive
(HUR) domain, was identified, rather than the Kr端ppel-associated box like domain.
The N-terminal region upstream of HUR domain seemed to be also indispensable to
the repression. Thus, we propose that HUB1 is a new type repressor and plays an
important role in the HTLV-I U5-mediated repression.
