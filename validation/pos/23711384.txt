Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a Cardiovirus, initiates its polyprotein with 
a short 67 amino acid Leader (L) sequence. The protein acts as a unique
pathogenicity factor, with anti-host activities which include the triggering of
nuclear pore complex hyperphosphorylation and direct binding inhibition of the
active cellular transport protein, Ran GTPase. Chemical modifications and protein
mutagenesis now map the Ran binding domain to the L hinge-linker region, and in
particular, to amino acids 35-40. Large deletions affecting this region were
shown previously to diminish Ran binding. New point mutations, especially K35Q,
D37A and W40A, preserve the intact L structure, abolish Ran binding and are
deficient for nucleoporin (Nup) hyperphosphorylation. Ran itself morphs through
multiple configurations, but reacts most effectively with L when in the GDP
format, preferably with an empty nucleotide binding pocket. Therefore, L:Ran
binding, mediated by the linker-hinge, is a required step in L-induced nuclear
transport inhibition.
