The comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of intraviral protein interactions in
two members of the herpesvirus family, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), revealed 123 and 173 interactions,
respectively. Viral protein interaction networks resemble single, highly coupled 
modules, whereas cellular networks are organized in separate functional
submodules. Predicted and experimentally verified interactions between KSHV and
human proteins were used to connect the viral interactome into a prototypical
human interactome and to simulate infection. The analysis of the combined system 
showed that the viral network adopts cellular network features and that protein
networks of herpesviruses and possibly other intracellular pathogens have
distinguishing topologies.
