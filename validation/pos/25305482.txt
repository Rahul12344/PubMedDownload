Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus responsible for chronic
liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RacGTPase-activating protein 1 
(RacGAP1) plays an important role during GTP hydrolysis to GDP in Rac1 and CDC42 
protein and has been demonstrated to be upregulated in several cancers, including
HCC. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the upregulation of RacGAP1
remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that RacGAP1 levels were enhanced in
HCV cell-culture-derived (HCVcc) infection. More importantly, we illustrated that
RacGAP1 interacts with the viral protein NS5B in mammalian cells. The small
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of RacGAP1 in human hepatoma cell
lines inhibited replication of HCV RNA, protein, and production of infectious
particles of HCV genotype 2a strain JFH1. Conversely, these were reversed by the 
expression of a siRNA-resistant RacGAP1 recombinant protein. In addition, viral
protein NS5B polymerase activity was significantly reduced by silencing RacGAP1
and, vice versa, was increased by overexpression of RacGAP1 in a cell-based
reporter assay. Our results suggest that RacGAP1 plays a crucial role in HCV
replication by affecting viral protein NS5B polymerase activity and holds
importance for antiviral drug development.
