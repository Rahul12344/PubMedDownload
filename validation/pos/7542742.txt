Mouse embryo cells expressing a wild-type number of insulin-like growth factor I 
receptors (IGF-IR) (W cells) can be transformed either by simian virus 40 large T
antigen (SV40 T) or by overexpressed insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), singly
transfected. Neither SV40 T antigen nor IRS-1, individually, can transform mouse 
embryo cells with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes (R- cells). However, 
cotransfection of SV40 T antigen and IRS-1 does transform R- cells. In this
study, using different antibodies and different cell lines, we found that SV40 T 
antigen and IRS-1 are coprecipitated from cell lysates in a specific fashion,
regardless of whether the lysates are immunoprecipitated with an antibody to SV40
T antigen or an antibody to IRS-1. The same antibody to SV40 T antigen, however, 
fails to coprecipitate another substrate of IGF-IR, the transforming protein Shc,
and two other signal-transducing molecules, Grb2 and Sos. Finally, an SV40 T
antigen lacking the amino-terminal 250 amino acids fails to coprecipitate IRS-1
and also fails to transform R- cells overexpressing mouse IRS-1. These
experiments indicate that IRS-1 associates with SV40 T antigen and that this
association plays a critical role in the combined ability of these proteins to
transform R- cells. This finding is discussed in light of the crucial role of the
IGF-IR in the establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype.
