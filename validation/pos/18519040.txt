Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and pathogenesis involve both virus-encoded
proteins and cellular factors. In our study, we showed that NS5B, the HCV
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interacted with M2 type pyruvate kinase (M2PK) but 
not L type pyruvate kinase. We confirmed the interaction by GST pull down,
coimmunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence analysis in cells with
transient expression of NS5B and M2PK as well as in a HCV replicon-bearing cell
line. Furthermore shRNA which specifically down-regulated M2PK expression could
inhibit the replication of HCV in HCV replicon 9B cells.
