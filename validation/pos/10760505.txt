The NH(2)-terminal end of a protein, named SMCp, which contains an ARID (A/T rich
interaction domain) DNA binding domain and is similar to the mammalian SMCY/SMCX 
proteins and retinoblastoma binding protein 2, was shown to bind the African
swine fever virus encoded ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBCv1) using the yeast
two hybrid system and in in vitro binding assays. Antisera raised against the
SMCp protein were used to show that the protein is present in the cell nucleus.
Immunofluorescence showed that although UBCv1 is present in the nucleus in most
cells, in some cells it is in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it shuttles between 
the nucleus and cytoplasm. The interaction and co-localisation of UBCv1 with SMCp
suggest that SMCp may be a substrate in vivo for the enzyme.
