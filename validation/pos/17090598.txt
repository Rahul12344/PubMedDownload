HIV-1 integrase (IN) is the key enzyme catalyzing the proviral DNA integration
step. Although the enzyme catalyzes the integration step accurately in vitro,
whether IN is sufficient for in vivo integration and how it interacts with the
cellular machinery remains unclear. We set up a yeast cellular integration system
where integrase was expressed as the sole HIV-1 protein and targeted the
chromosomes. In this simple eukaryotic model, integrase is necessary and
sufficient for the insertion of a DNA containing viral LTRs into the genome,
thereby allowing the study of the isolated integration step independently of
other viral mechanisms. Furthermore, the yeast system was used to identify
cellular mechanisms involved in the integration step and allowed us to show the
role of homologous recombination systems. We demonstrated physical interactions
between HIV-1 IN and RAD51 protein and showed that HIV-1 integrase activity could
be inhibited both in the cell and in vitro by RAD51 protein. Our data allowed the
identification of RAD51 as a novel in vitro IN cofactor able to down regulate the
activity of this retroviral enzyme, thereby acting as a potential cellular
restriction factor to HIV infection.
