In eukaryotes, there are at least 60 members of the DExD/H helicase family, many 
of which are able to sense viral nucleic acids. By screening all known family
members, we identified the helicase DHX33 as a novel double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 
sensor in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). The knockdown of DHX33 using small
heteroduplex RNA (shRNA) blocked the ability of mDCs to produce type I interferon
(IFN) in response to poly I:C and reovirus. The HELICc domain of DHX33 was shown 
to bind poly I:C. The interaction between DHX33 and IPS-1 is mediated by the
HELICc region of DHX33 and the C-terminal domain of IPS-1 (also referred to MAVS 
and VISA). The inhibition of DHX33 expression by RNA interference blocked the
poly I:C-induced activation of MAP kinases, NF-ÎºB and IRF3. The interaction
between the helicase DHX33 and IPS-1 was independent of RIG-I/MDA5 and may be a
novel pathway for sensing poly I:C and RNA viruses in mDCs.
