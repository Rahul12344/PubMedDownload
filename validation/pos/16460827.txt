Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses an immediate-early protein, Rta, to activate
the viral lytic cycle. This study identifies PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta as binding 
partners of Rta in a yeast two-hybrid screen and demonstrates the binding of Rta 
to PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta in vitro by GST pull-down analysis.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and indirect immunofluorescence analysis show
that Rta interacts and colocalizes with PIASxalpha and PIASxbeta in the nucleus. 
These interactions seem to enhance Rta sumoylation as transfecting plasmids
expressing PIASxalpha, PIASxbeta, Ubc9, or SUMO-1 increase the capacity of Rta to
transactivate a promoter that contains an Rta-response element and the promoters 
of p21 and BNLF1 in transient transfection assay. This study also finds that Rta 
sumoylation is preferentially enhanced by PIASxbeta, which could be attributed to
the fact that PIASxbeta, compared to PIASxalpha, has a strong affinity to Rta,
suggesting that affinity of a SUMO E3 ligase to its target protein influences the
function of protein sumoylation.
