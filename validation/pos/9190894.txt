The Tax protein of the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV) activates the
expression of viral mRNA through a three 21 bp repeat enhancer located within the
HTLV-1 LTR. Since Tax does not bind to the 21 bp DNA repeats directly, it has
been speculated that Tax interacts with cellular protein(s) which mediate binding
to the enhancer. We employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify host
proteins that are potentially relevant to Tax transactivation. We identified a
Tax binding protein encoded from a cDNA expression library derived from
peripheral blood lymphocytes. The corresponding cDNA has sequence identity with a
known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 also binds to
GST-Tax fusion protein in vitro. Tax mutants that did not transactivate the
HTLV-1 LTR also failed to bind ATF-4. The critical domain for Tax binding resides
in a 85 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of ATF-4, which contains the basic
domain and leucine zipper. We further demonstrated that both full length and
N-terminal truncated ATF-4 were able to enhance Tax transactivation. Thus, ATF-4 
may act as an adapter between Tax and the TRE (Tax responsive element), and play 
an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation.
