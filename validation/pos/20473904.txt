We report that MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, can bind to EBNA-5. Using GST
pull-down assay, immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance and
immunostaining of lymphoblastoid cells, we found that trimolecular complexes are 
formed between EBNA-5, MDM2 and p53, where MDM2 serves as a bridge. The EBNA-5
binding to MDM2 counteracted destabilizing effect of the latter on the p53. In
ubiquitination and degradation assays in vitro, EBNA-5 inhibited p53
polyubiquitination (but not monoubiquitination) in a concentration-dependent
manner. This resembles the effect of p14ARF on p53. Moreover, EBNA-5 was found to
inhibit the degradation of p53 in vitro. High levels of p53 expression were
maintained in LCLs. The binding of EBNA-5 to MDM2 also could impair the
functional activity of p53. The p53-dependent genes P21 and VDR were not induced 
in EBV-infected, in contrast to mitogen-activated cells. This may explain the
tolerance of established LCLs to high levels of p53 without undergoing apoptosis.
