The Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein of avian influenza (AI) viruses is important
for pathogenicity. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized tandem PDZ-ligand 
(TPL) domain in the extreme carboxy terminus of NS1 proteins from a subset of
globally circulating AI viruses. By using protein arrays we have identified
several human PDZ-cellular ligands of this novel domain, one of which is the RIL 
protein, a known regulator of the cellular tyrosine kinase Src. We found that the
AI NS1 proteins bind and stimulate human Src tyrosine kinase, through their
carboxy terminal Src homology type 3-binding (SHB) domain. The physical
interaction between NS1 and Src and the ability of AI viruses to modulate the
phosphorylation status of Src during the infection, were found to be influenced
by the TPL arrangement. These results indicate the potential for novel
host-pathogen interactions mediated by the TPL and SHB domains of AI NS1 protein.
