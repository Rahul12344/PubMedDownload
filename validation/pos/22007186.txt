Measles, caused by measles virus (MeV) infection, is the leading cause of death
in children because of secondary infections attributable to MeV-induced immune
suppression. Recently, we have shown that wild-type MeVs induce the suppression
of protein synthesis in host cells (referred to as "shutoff") and that viral
mRNAs are preferentially translated under shutoff conditions in infected cells.
To determine the mechanism behind the preferential translation of viral mRNA, we 
focused on the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of nucleocapsid (N) mRNA. The La/SSB 
autoantigen (La) was found to specifically bind to an N-5'UTR probe. Recombinant 
La enhanced the translation of luciferase mRNA containing the N-5'UTR (N-fLuc),
and RNA interference of La suppressed N-fLuc translation. Furthermore,
recombinant MeV lacking the La-binding motif in the N-5'UTR displayed delayed
viral protein synthesis and growth kinetics at an early phase of infection. These
results suggest that La induced predominant translation of N mRNA via binding to 
its 5'UTR under shutoff conditions. This is the first report on a cellular factor
that specifically regulates paramyxovirus mRNA translation.
