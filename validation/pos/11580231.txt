Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause benign and malignant epithelial tumors of the
respiratory and genital mucosa. We previously reported that recurrent respiratory
papillomas caused by HPV 6/11 express low levels of antibody-detectable TAP-1,
the protein that transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly 
and presentation by MHC Class I, and that the extent of TAP-1 immunostaining is
inversely related to the frequency of disease recurrence. We have now determined 
a mechanism for the reduction in TAP-1 detection. Anti-TAP-1 antibody
immunoprecipitated very low amounts of protein from papilloma cells. However,
immunoprecipitation of calreticulin, another member of the MHC I assembly
complex, coprecipitated TAP-1 at levels comparable to those of uninfected cells. 
Immunoprecipitation of an HPV-positive cell line with either anti-TAP-1 or
anti-calreticulin coprecipitated HPV E7 protein. Finally, purified HPV 11 E7
protein inhibited ATP-dependent peptide transport in vitro. We propose that the
interaction of E7 with TAP-1 prevents TAP-1 antibody detection and efficient
peptide transport, resulting in poor presentation of viral antigen on
HPV-infected cells and thus failure to mount an effective immune-mediated
prevention of disease recurrence.
