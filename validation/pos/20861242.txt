effector of Notch signaling.

In cells infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV),
CSL/CBF1 signaling is essential for viral replication and promotes the survival
of KSHV-infected cells. CSL/CBF1 is a DNA adaptor molecule which recruits
coactivator and corepressor complexes to regulate viral and cellular gene
transcription and which is a major downstream effector molecule of activated
Notch. The interaction of KSHV RTA and LANA with CSL/CBF1 has been shown to
balance the lytic and latent viral life cycle. Here we report that a third KSHV
protein, viral interferon regulatory factor 4 (vIRF4/K10), but none of the three 
other KSHV-encoded vIRFs, interacts with CSL/CBF1. Two regions of vIRF4 with
dissimilar affinities contribute to CSL/CBF1 binding. Similar to Notch, vIRF4
targets the hydrophobic pocket in the beta trefoil domain of CSL/CBF1 through a
short peptide motif which closely resembles a motif found in Notch but does not
strictly follow the ΦWΦP consensus conserved in human and mouse Notch proteins.
Our results suggest that vIRF4 might compete with Notch for CSL/CBF1 binding and 
signaling.
