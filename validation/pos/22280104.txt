In earlier studies we provided evidence that vaccinia virus (VACV)
phosphorylation-activation of host cell signaling effectors is critical for
subsequent viral replication. In this report, using mass spectrometry-based
proteomics, we have identified 387 host cell proteins that co-immunoprecipitate
with VACV in infected, permissive PM1.CCR5 human T cells. Among these, glomulin
was distinguishable based on its known interaction with a tyrosine kinase
receptor, c-Met, its ability to become tyrosine-phosphorylated, and its
association with signaling effectors. siRNA knockdown of glomulin expression in
PM1.CCR5 T cells reduces VACV infection. Glomulin interacts with the inactive,
nonphosphorylated form of c-MET. We demonstrate that treatment of PM1.CCR5 T
cells with a c-Met phosphorylation inhibitor leads to a significant reduction in 
VACV infectivity. Additionally, inhibition of phosphorylation of c-Met abrogates 
VACV-inducible phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and IRS-2, signaling effectors
identified as critical for VACV infection. These data identify glomulin as a
permissivity factor for VACV infection and as a potential therapeutic target for 
inhibition of VACV infection.
