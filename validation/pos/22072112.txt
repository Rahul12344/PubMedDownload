Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) is a major component of viral
nucleocapsid and a multifunctional protein involved in viral maturation and
release. It is unstable and present in cells at low level because of K96 lysine
residue, which is a ubiquitin acceptor site. Np95/ICBP90-like RING finger protein
(NIRF) has auto-ubiquitination activity which is the hallmark of a ubiquitin
ligase. In the present study, ubiquitin ligase, NIRF, binds to HBc and leads to
the proteasome-mediated degradation of HBc in vivo. NIRF down-regulates HBc
protein level, resulting in the decrease of the amount of HBV particles in
supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. However knockdown of NIRF significantly
increases endogenous HBc protein level, leading to HBV release. The results
reveal that NIRF interacts with HBc and promotes the degradation of HBc in vivo. 
The pathway of NIRF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome affects the release of HBV
particles by controlling the amounts of HBc. It indicates that NIRF may
participate in the maturation of HBV.
