Flavivirus pre-membrane (prM) protein is important for proper folding and
secretion of envelope (E) protein. However, other non-structural functions of prM
protein in the context of virus life-cycle are poorly known. In this study, we
aimed to elucidate if dengue virus (DV) prM protein interacts with host proteins 
and contributes to viral pathogenesis by screening human liver cDNA
yeast-two-hybrid library. Our study identified vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) as a
novel interacting partner of DV prM protein and aminoacid residues from 76 to 80 
of prM protein are crucial to mediate V-ATPase binding. We showed that V-ATPase
plays an important role in mediating low-pH dependent entry of DV. The biological
significance of prM-V-ATPase interaction is also elucidated and we have shown
that this association is critical to influence efficient virus egression. This
study highlighted for the first time that flavivirus prM protein interacts with
V-ATPase and V-ATPase mediates both entry and egression of DV.
