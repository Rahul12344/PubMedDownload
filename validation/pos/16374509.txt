We have determined the human genome to contain 296 different Src homology-3 (SH3)
domains and cloned them into a phage-display vector. This provided a powerful and
unbiased system for simultaneous assaying of the complete human SH3 proteome for 
the strongest binding to target proteins of interest, without the limitations
posed by short linear peptide ligands or confounding variables of more indirect
methods for protein interaction screening. Studies involving three ligand
proteins, human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef, p21-activated kinase (PAK)2 and
ADAM15, showed previously reported as well as novel SH3 partners with nanomolar
affinities specific for them. This argues that SH3 domains may have a more
dominant role in directing cellular protein interactions than has been assumed.
Besides showing potentially important new SH3-directed interactions, these
studies also led to the discovery of novel signalling proteins, such as the
PAK2-binding adaptor protein POSH2 and the ADAM15-binding sorting nexin family
member SNX30.
