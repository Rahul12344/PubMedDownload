BACKGROUND: To isolate cellular proteins interacting with hepatitis B virus X
protein (HBX), from HepG2 cells infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV).
RESULTS: HBV particles were produced in culture medium of HepG2 cells transfected
with the mammalian expression vector containing the linear HBV genome, as
assessed by commercially available ELISA assay. A cDNA library was made from
these cells exposed to HBV. From yeast two hybrid screening with HBX as bait,
human guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit 5L (GNbeta5) was isolated
from the cDNA library constructed in this study as a new HBX-interacting protein.
The HBX-GNbeta5 interaction was further supported by mammalian two hybrid assay.
CONCLUSION: The use of a cDNA library constructed from HBV-transfected HepG2
cells has resulted in the isolation of new cellular proteins interacting with
HBX.
