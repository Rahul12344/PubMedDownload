It has recently been shown that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6
proteins can target the PDZ-domain containing proteins, Dlg, MUPP-1, MAGI-1 and
hScrib for proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E6 proteins from HPV-16 
and HPV-18 (the two most common high-risk virus types) differ in their ability to
target these proteins in a manner that correlates with their malignant potential.
To investigate the underlying mechanisms for this, we have mutated HPV-16 and
HPV-18 E6s to give each protein the other's PDZ-binding motif. Analysis of these 
mutants shows that the greater ability of HPV-18 E6 to bind to these proteins and
to target them for degradation is indeed due to a single amino acid difference.
Using a number of assays, we show that the E6 proteins interact specifically with
only one of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, and this is the first interaction
described for this particular PDZ domain. We also show that the guanylate kinase 
homology domain and the regions of MAGI-1 downstream of amino acid 733 are not
required for the degradation of MAGI-1. Finally, in a series of comparative
analyses, we show that the degradation of MAGI-1 occurs through a different
mechanism from that used by the E6 protein to induce the degradation of Dlg and
p53.
