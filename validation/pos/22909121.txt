BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence
factor, which is targeted into the cell cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus. NS1 is 
a multi-functional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and
counteracts host cell antiviral responses. Previously, we have shown that the NS1
protein of the H3N2 subtype influenza viruses possesses a C-terminal nuclear
localization signal (NLS) that also functions as a nucleolar localization signal 
(NoLS) and targets the protein into the nucleolus.
RESULTS: Here, we show that the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus subtype
interacts in vitro primarily via its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent
via its N-terminal NLS1 with the nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and fibrillarin.
Using chimeric green fluorescence protein (GFP)-NS1 fusion constructs, we show
that the nucleolar retention of the NS1 protein is determined by its C-terminal
NLS2/NoLS in vivo. Confocal laser microscopy analysis shows that the NS1 protein 
colocalizes with nucleolin in nucleoplasm and nucleolus and with B23 and
fibrillarin in the nucleolus of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus-infected A549 cells.
Since some viral proteins contain NoLSs, it is likely that viruses have evolved
specific nucleolar functions.
CONCLUSION: NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus interacts primarily via the
C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via the N-terminal NLS1 with the main 
nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin.
