Infection with human T-cell leukemia virus induces cellular genomic instability
mediated through the viral oncoprotein Tax. Here we present evidence that Tax
undermines the cellular DNA damage response by sequestration of damage response
factors. We show by confocal microscopy that Tax forms damage-independent nuclear
foci that contain DNA-PK, BRCA1, and MDC1. Tax sequesters MDC1 to chromatin sites
distinct from classic ionizing radiation-induced foci. The recruitment of MDC1 is
competitive between the two foci. The N-terminal region of Tax is sufficient for 
foci localization, and the C-terminal half is critical for binding to MDC1 and
recruitment of additional response factors. Tax expression and DNA damage
response factor recruitment repressed the formation of ionizing radiation-induced
Nbs1-containing foci. The Tax-induced "pseudo" DNA damage response results in
phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation of H2AX, which is ablated by siRNA
suppression of MDC1. These data support a model for virus-induced genomic
instability in which viral oncogene-induced damage-independent foci compete with 
normal cellular DNA damage response.
