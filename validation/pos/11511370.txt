Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection requires binding of the viral envelope
glycoprotein D (gD) to cell surface receptors. We report the X-ray structures of 
a soluble, truncated ectodomain of gD both alone and in complex with the
ectodomain of its cellular receptor HveA. Two bound anions suggest possible
binding sites for another gD receptor, a 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate.
Unexpectedly, the structures reveal a V-like immunoglobulin (Ig) fold at the core
of gD that is closely related to cellular adhesion molecules and flanked by large
N- and C-terminal extensions. The receptor binding segment of gD, an N-terminal
hairpin, appears conformationally flexible, suggesting that a conformational
change accompanying binding might be part of the viral entry mechanism.
