Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is maintained as a stable episome 
in latently infected pleural effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. Episome maintenance
is conferred by the binding of the KSHV-encoded LANA protein to the viral
terminal repeats (TR). Here, we show that DNA replication in the KSHV TR is
coupled with DNA recombination and mediated in part through the cellular
replication fork protection factors Timeless (Tim) and Tipin. We show by
two-dimensional (2D) agarose gel electrophoresis that replication forks naturally
stall and form recombination-like structures at the TR during an unperturbed cell
cycle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that Tim and Tipin
are selectively enriched at the KSHV TR during S phase and in a LANA-dependent
manner. Tim depletion inhibited LANA-dependent TR DNA replication and caused the 
loss of KSHV episomes from latently infected PEL cells. Tim depletion resulted in
the aberrant accumulation of recombination structures and arrested MCM helicase
at TR. Tim depletion did not induce the KSHV lytic cycle or apoptotic cell death.
We propose that KSHV episome maintenance requires Tim-assisted replication fork
protection at the viral terminal repeats and that Tim-dependent
recombination-like structures form at TR to promote DNA repeat stability and
viral genome maintenance.
