The CR3 activation domain of the human adenovirus E1A protein stimulates
transcription by forming protein-protein interactions with DNA sequence-specific 
binding factors and components of the TFIID complex. Here, we demonstrate that
CR3 can complex with the extreme C-terminal 105 amino acids of the human TATA box
binding-factor-associated protein, hTAF(II)135. Furthermore, the C-terminal
region of hTAF(II)135 can block transcriptional stimulation from an E1A-inducible
promoter in vivo. This ability of the C terminus of hTAF(II)135 to bind CR3 and
to inhibit E1A-inducible activation is highly specific. These results demonstrate
for the first time that a discrete fragment of a mammalian TBP-associated factor 
which targets a specific activator can impair the stimulation of transcription.
