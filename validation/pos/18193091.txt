Accurate chromosomal segregation is monitored by the mitotic checkpoint, and an
increased rate of chromosomal missegregation leads to chromosomal instability
(CIN). Here, we demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) binds BubR1, a component
of the mitotic checkpoint complex and co-localizes with BubR1 at the
kinetochores. HBx binding to BubR1 attenuates the association between BubR1 and
CDC20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and
induces slippage of mitotic arrest in the presence of microtubule poisons. In
addition, HBx binding to BubR1 results in the accumulation of lagging chromosomes
and chromosome bridges. In contrast, a C-terminally truncated HBx mutant
(HBx(1-100)) fails to bind BubR1 and does not cause aberrant chromosomal
segregation. This provides a novel mechanism for dysregulation of the mitotic
checkpoint by a viral pathogen linking it to the accumulation of chromosomal
instability in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.
