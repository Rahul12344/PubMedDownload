Repulsive signaling by Semaphorins and Plexins is crucial for the development and
homeostasis of the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Sema7A acts as
both an immune and a neural Semaphorin through PlexinC1, and A39R is a Sema7A
mimic secreted by smallpox virus. We report the structures of Sema7A and A39R
complexed with the Semaphorin-binding module of PlexinC1. Both structures show
two PlexinC1 molecules symmetrically bridged by Semaphorin dimers, in which the
Semaphorin and PlexinC1 beta propellers interact in an edge-on, orthogonal
orientation. Both binding interfaces are dominated by the insertion of the
Semaphorin's 4c-4d loop into a deep groove in blade 3 of the PlexinC1 propeller. 
A39R appears to achieve Sema7A mimicry by preserving key Plexin-binding
determinants seen in the mammalian Sema7A complex that have evolved to achieve
higher affinity binding to the host-derived PlexinC1. The complex structures
support a conserved Semaphorin-Plexin recognition mode and suggest that Plexins
are activated by dimerization.
