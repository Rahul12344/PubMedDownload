Influenza A viruses (IAV) bind to sialic-acids at cellular surfaces and enter
cells by using endocytotic routes. There is evidence that this process does not
occur constitutively but requires induction of specific cellular signals,
including activation of PI3K that promotes virus internalization. This implies
engagement of cellular signaling receptors during viral entry. Here, we present
first indications for an interplay of IAV with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). 
As representative RTK family-members the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
and the c-Met receptor were studied. Modulation of expression or activity of both
RTKs resulted in altered uptake of IAV, showing that these receptors transmit
entry relevant signals upon virus binding. More detailed studies on EGFR function
revealed that virus binding lead to clustering of lipid-rafts, suggesting that
multivalent binding of IAV to cells induces a signaling platform leading to
activation of EGFR and other RTKs that in turn facilitates IAV uptake.
