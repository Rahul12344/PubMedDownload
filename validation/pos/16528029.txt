Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) gene 7L encodes a seven-transmembrane G
protein-coupled receptor with 53 % amino acid identity to human CC chemokine
receptor 8 (CCR8). Initial characterization of 7L showed that this 56 kDa
cell-surface glycoprotein binds human CCL1 with high affinity (Kd=0.6 nM) and
induces signal transduction by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and
downstream protein kinases. Further characterization of YLDV 7L is presented here
and shows that murine CC chemokines can induce G-protein activation via the 7L
receptor, despite having a low binding affinity for this receptor. In addition,
when expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV), YLDV 7L was found on the
outer envelope of VACV extracellular enveloped virus. The contribution of 7L to
poxvirus pathogenesis was investigated by infection of mice with a recombinant
VACV expressing 7L (vDeltaB8R-7L) and was compared with the outcome of infection 
by parental and revertant control viruses. In both intranasal and intradermal
models, expression of 7L caused attenuation of VACV. The role of this protein in 
viral virulence is discussed.
