XRCC1 protein is required for the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and genetic 
stability, and is essential for viability in mammals. XRCC1 functions as a
scaffold protein by interacting and modulating polypeptide components of the
single-strand break repair machinery, including AP endonuclease-1, DNA ligase
IIIalpha, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA polymerase beta and human
polynucleotide kinase. We show here that the E6 protein of human papillomavirus
type 1, 8 and 16 directly binds XRCC1. When tested in CHO derived XRCC1 'knock
out' EM9 cells, co-expression of human papillomavirus 16 E6 with human XRCC1
reduced the ability of the latter protein to correct the methyl methane sulfate
sensitivity of XRCC1 mutant CHO cell line EM9. These data identify a novel link
between small DNA tumour viruses and DNA repair pathways, and suggest a novel
explanation for the development of genomic instability in tissue cells
persistently infected with papillomaviruses.
