Autonomously replicating DNA viruses must evade mitotic checkpoints and actively 
partition their genomes to maintain persistent infection. The E2 protein serves
these functions by tethering papillomavirus episomes to mitotic chromosomes;
however, the mechanism remains unresolved. We show that E2 binds ChlR1, a DNA
helicase that plays a role in sister chromatid cohesion. The E2 mutation W130R
fails to bind ChlR1 and correspondingly does not associate with mitotic
chromosomes. Viral genomes encoding this E2 mutation are not episomally
maintained in cell culture. Notably, E2 W130R binds Brd4, which reportedly acts
as a mitotic tether, indicating this interaction is insufficient for E2
association with mitotic chromosomes. RNAi-induced depletion of ChlR1
significantly reduced E2 localization to mitotic chromosomes. These studies
provide compelling evidence that ChlR1 association is required for loading the
papillomavirus E2 protein onto mitotic chromosomes and represents a
kinetochore-independent mechanism for viral genome maintenance and segregation.
