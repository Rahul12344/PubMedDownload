The hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer contains multiple active elements, one of
which is the EP element, a 15 bp site important for its regulation by acting on
other functional elements like the E site. The EP element, in the HBV enhancer
context, contains two putative binding sites for c-myb family gene products.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the minimal c-Myb DNA-binding
domain binds to the EP sequence. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that
only one consensus binding site was effectively protected. We found that c-Myb
down-regulates transcription driving by the HBV enhancer in CAT assays performed 
in a haematopoietic (K562) and in a hepatic (HepG2) cell line. Interestingly,
co-expression of both c-Myb and NF-M, a C/EBPbeta homologue which recognises the 
E element of the HBV enhancer, showed a synergistic transactivation of the HBV
enhancer while, separately, each of them had an inhibitory effect on
transcription in HepG2 and K562 cell lines, two cell types potentially infected
by the hepatitis B virus.
