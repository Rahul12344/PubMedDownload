The mechanism of budding of influenza A virus revealed important deviation from
the consensus mechanism of budding of retroviruses and of a growing number of
negative-strand RNA viruses. This study is focused on the role of the influenza A
virus matrix protein M1 in virus release. We found that a mutation of the proline
residue at position 16 of the matrix protein induces inhibition of virus
detachment from cells. Depletion of the M1-binding protein RACK1 also impairs
virus release and RACK1 binding requires the proline residue at position 16 of
M1. The impaired M1-RACK1 interaction does not affect the plasma membrane binding
of M1; in contrast, RACK1 is recruited to detergent-resistant membranes in a
M1-proline-16-dependent manner. The proline-16 mutation in M1 and depletion of
RACK1 impairs the pinching-off of the budding virus particles. These findings
reveal the active role of the viral matrix protein in the release of influenza A 
virus particles that involves a cross-talk with a RACK1-mediated pathway.
