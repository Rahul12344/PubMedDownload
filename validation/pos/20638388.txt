Retrovirus replication critically depends on a dynamic interplay between
retroviral and host proteins. We report on the binding of the surface subunit
(glycoprotein 120 (gp120)) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
envelope protein (Env) to the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the voltage-gated
potassium channel BEC1 (brain-specific ether-a-go-go-like channel 1), an
interaction that can result in the repression of BEC's activity and the
inhibition of HIV-1 particle-release. BEC1 protein was found to be expressed in T
cells and macrophages, the major target cells of HIV-1. Thus, gp120/BEC1
interaction may be involved in HIV-1 life cycle and/or pathogenesis.
