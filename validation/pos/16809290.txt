Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is transmitted through a viral
synapse and enters target cells via interaction with the glucose transporter
GLUT1. Here, we show that Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the receptor for semaphorin-3A and
VEGF-A165 and a member of the immune synapse, is also a physical and functional
partner of HTLV-1 envelope (Env) proteins. HTLV-1 Env and NRP1 complexes are
formed in cotransfected cells, and endogenous NRP1 contributes to the binding of 
HTLV-1 Env to target cells. NRP1 overexpression increases HTLV-1 Env-dependent
syncytium formation. Moreover, overexpression of NRP1 increases both HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2 Env-dependent infection, whereas down-regulation of endogenous NRP1 has
the opposite effect. Finally, overexpressed GLUT1, NRP1, and Env form ternary
complexes in transfected cells, and endogenous NRP1 and GLUT1 colocalize in
membrane junctions formed between uninfected and HTLV-1-infected T cells. These
data show that NRP1 is involved in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 entry, suggesting that the
HTLV receptor has a multicomponent nature.
