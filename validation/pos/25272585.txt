Bel1, a transactivator of prototype foamy virus (PFV), plays pivotal roles in the
replication of PFV. Previous studies have shown that Bel1 bears a nuclear
localization signal (NLS), but its amino acid sequence remains unclear and the
corresponding importins have not been identified. In this report, we inserted
various fragments of Bel1 into an EGFP-GST fusion protein and investigated their 
subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. We found that the
215PRQKRPR221 fragment could direct nuclear localization, which accords with the 
consensus sequence K(K/R)X(K/R) of monopartite NLS. Point mutation experiments
revealed that K218, R219, and R221 are essential for the nuclear localization of 
Bel1. The results of the GST-pulldown showed that the Bel1 fragment with residues
215-223, which bears the NLS, interacts with KPNA1, KPNA6, and KPNA7. This result
suggests that KPNA1, KPNA6, and KPNA7 maybe involved in Bel1 nuclear
translocation.
