DNAJC14 is an Hsp40 family member that broadly modulates flavivirus replication. 
The mechanism by which DNAJC14 stoichiometrically participates in flavivirus
replication complex (RC) formation is unknown; both reduced and elevated levels
result in replication inhibition. Using yellow fever virus (YFV), we demonstrate 
that DNAJC14 redistributes and clusters with YFV nonstructural proteins via a
transmembrane domain and a newly identified membrane-binding domain (MBD), which 
both mediate targeting to detergent-resistant membranes. Furthermore, the RC and 
DNAJC14 reside as part of a protein interaction network that remains after 1%
Triton solubilization. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that entry into this
protein interaction network requires the DNAJC14 C-terminal self-interaction
domain. Fusion of the DNAJC14 MBD and self-interaction domain with another Hsp40 
family protein is sufficient to confer YFV-inhibitory activity. Our findings
support a novel model of DNAJC14 action that includes specific membrane targeting
of both DNAJC14 and YFV replication proteins, the formation of protein
interactions, and a microdomain-specific chaperone event leading to RC formation.
This process alters the properties of the RC membrane and results in the
formation of a protein scaffold that maintains the RC.
