BACKGROUND: Oncoprotein Tax, encoded by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
(HTLV1), persistently induces NF-κB activation, which contributes to
HTLV1-mediated T-cell transformation. Recent studies suggest that the signaling
function of Tax requires its ubiquitination, although how the Tax ubiquitination 
is regulated remains unclear.
RESULTS: We show here that the deubiquitinase CYLD physically interacts with Tax 
and negatively regulates the ubiquitination of this viral protein. This function 
of CYLD is associated with inhibition of Tax-mediated activation of IKK although 
not that of Tak1. Interestingly, CYLD undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in
HTLV1-transformed T cells, a mechanism known to inactivate the catalytic activity
of CYLD. Consistently, a phospho-mimetic CYLD mutant fails to inhibit Tax
ubiquitination.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CYLD negatively regulates the signaling
function of Tax through inhibition of Tax ubiquitination. Conversely, induction
of CYLD phosphorylation may serve as a mechanism by which HTLV1 overrides the
inhibitory function of CYLD, leading to the persistent activation of NF-κB.
