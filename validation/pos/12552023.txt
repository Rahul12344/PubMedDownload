The proper folding and assembly of viral envelope proteins are mediated by host
chaperones. In this study, we demonstrated that an endoplasmic reticulum luminal 
chaperone GRP78/BiP bound specifically to the pre-S1 domain of the L protein in
vitro and in vivo where complete viral particles were secreted, suggesting that
GRP78/BiP plays an essential role in the proper folding of the L protein and/or
assembly of viral envelope proteins.
