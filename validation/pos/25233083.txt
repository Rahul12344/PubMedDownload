The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1)-encoded ICP22 protein plays an important role 
in viral infection and affects expression of host cell genes. ICP22 is known to
reduce the global level of serine (Ser)2 phosphorylation of the
Tyr1Ser2Pro3Thr4Ser5Pro6Ser7 heptapeptide repeats comprising the carboxy-terminal
domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase (pol) II. Accordingly, ICP22 
is thought to associate with and inhibit the activity of the
positive-transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) pol II CTD Ser2 kinase. We
show here that ICP22 causes loss of CTD Ser2 phosphorylation from pol II engaged 
in transcription of protein-coding genes following ectopic expression in HeLa
cells and that recombinant ICP22 interacts with the CDK9 subunit of recombinant
P-TEFb. ICP22 also interacts with pol II in vitro. Residues 193 to 256 of ICP22
are sufficient for interaction with CDK9 and inhibition of pol II CTD Ser2
phosphorylation but do not interact with pol II. These results indicate that
discrete regions of ICP22 interact with either CDK9 or pol II and that ICP22
interacts directly with CDK9 to inhibit expression of host cell genes.
