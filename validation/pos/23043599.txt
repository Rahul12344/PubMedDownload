The influenza A virus (IAV) protein PB1-F2, which is encoded by an alternative
ORF of the PB1 polymerase gene, has been implicated as an important virulence
factor and apoptosis inducer. However, the molecular mechanism of PB1-F2 function
remains elusive. In this study, eight cellular proteins were identified as
potential PB1-F2 interacting partners using the yeast two-hybrid system. Two
positive candidate proteins, guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) beta 
polypeptide 2 (Gβ2) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), were
selected to be further characterized. The interaction of MIF and Gβ2 with PB1-F2 
was confirmed by both GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Confocal
laser microscopy showed that the interaction between PB1-F2 and the two cellular 
proteins occurred in the cytoplasm. The novel interactions between PB1-F2 and
host proteins provide further pieces of evidence in the investigation of the
pathogenic mechanism of IAV.KEYWORDS: influenza A virus; PB1-F2; yeast
two-hybrid; protein-protein interaction.
