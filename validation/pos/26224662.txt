Comment in
    Hepatology. 2016 Jan;63(1):11-3.

Chronic hepatitis B and D infections are major causes of liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Efficient therapeutic approaches for cure are
absent. Sharing the same envelope proteins, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis delta
virus use the sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (a bile acid
transporter) as a receptor to enter hepatocytes. However, the detailed mechanisms
of the viral entry process are still poorly understood. Here, we established a
high-throughput infectious cell culture model enabling functional genomics of
hepatitis delta virus entry and infection. Using a targeted RNA interference
entry screen, we identified glypican 5 as a common host cell entry factor for
hepatitis B and delta viruses.CONCLUSION: These findings advance our
understanding of virus cell entry and open new avenues for curative therapies. As
glypicans have been shown to play a role in the control of cell division and
growth regulation, virus-glypican 5 interactions may also play a role in the
pathogenesis of virus-induced liver disease and cancer.
