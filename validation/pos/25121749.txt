Immune evasion genes help human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establish lifelong
persistence. Without immune pressure, laboratory-adapted HCMV strains have
undergone genetic alterations. Among these, the deletion of the UL/b' domain is
associated with loss of virulence. In a screen of UL/b', we identified pUL135 as 
a protein responsible for the characteristic cytopathic effect of clinical HCMV
strains that also protected from natural killer (NK) and T cell attack. pUL135
interacted directly with abl interactor 1 (ABI1) and ABI2 to recruit the WAVE2
regulatory complex to the plasma membrane, remodel the actin cytoskeleton and
dramatically reduce the efficiency of immune synapse (IS) formation. An intimate 
association between F-actin filaments in target cells and the IS was dispelled by
pUL135 expression. Thus, F-actin in target cells plays a critical role in
synaptogenesis, and this can be exploited by pathogens to protect against
cytotoxic immune effector cells. An independent interaction between pUL135 and
talin disrupted cell contacts with the extracellular matrix.
