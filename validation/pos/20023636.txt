Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a lymphotropic retrovirus whose
cell-to-cell transmission requires cell contacts. HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes
form 'virological synapses', but the mechanism of HTLV-1 transmission remains
poorly understood. We show here that HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes transiently
store viral particles as carbohydrate-rich extracellular assemblies that are held
together and attached to the cell surface by virally-induced extracellular matrix
components, including collagen and agrin, and cellular linker proteins, such as
tetherin and galectin-3. Extracellular viral assemblies rapidly adhere to other
cells upon cell contact, allowing virus spread and infection of target cells.
Their removal strongly reduces the ability of HTLV-1-producing cells to infect
target cells. Our findings unveil a novel virus transmission mechanism based on
the generation of extracellular viral particle assemblies whose structure,
composition and function resemble those of bacterial biofilms. HTLV-1
biofilm-like structures represent a major route for virus transmission from cell 
to cell.
