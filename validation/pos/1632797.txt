Previous studies showed that apoA1, the major protein component of HDL (High
Density Lipoprotein), inhibited HIV infectivity and virus-induced syncytia
formation. The mechanism of inhibition is unknown. We bring here evidence that
the amphipathic helices of apoA1 interact with the N-terminal peptides of SIV
gp32 and HIV gp41. These peptides have been shown to be associated with the
initial steps of the fusion between the host cell and the virus. Binding of apoA1
to these peptides prevents the insertion of the fusogenic domains into the cell
membrane and inhibits the fusion and the entry of the virus into the host cell.
