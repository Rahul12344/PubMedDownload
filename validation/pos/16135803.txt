Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a potent transcriptional
activator of the HIV-1 promoter and also has the ability to modulate a number of 
cellular regulatory circuits including apoptosis. Tat exerts its effects through 
interaction with viral as well as cellular proteins. Here, we studied the
influence of p73, a protein that is implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle
control, on Tat functions in the central nervous system. Protein interaction
studies using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot and glutathione
S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the association of Tat with p73. Tat 
bound to the N-terminal region of p73 spanning amino acids 1 to 120, and this
interaction required the cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 30 to 40) of Tat.
Association of p73 with Tat prevented the acetylation of Tat on lysine 28 by
PCAF. Functional studies including RNA interference showed that p73 inhibited Tat
stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, p73 prevented the interaction of 
Tat with cyclin T1 in vitro but not in vivo. These findings suggest possible new 
therapeutic approaches, using p73, for Tat-mediated AIDS pathogenesis.
