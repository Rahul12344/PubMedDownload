The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu accessory protein is a
transmembrane protein that down regulates CD4 expression and promotes the release
of new virions. We screened a human leukocyte-specific yeast two-hybrid
expression library to discover novel Vpu-interacting cellular proteins. The major
histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) invariant chain, also called Ii or
CD74, was found to be one such protein. We show direct binding of Vpu and CD74 by
using a yeast two-hybrid assay and coimmunoprecipitation from HIV-1-infected
cells. The cytoplasmic region of Vpu was found to interact with the 30-amino-acid
cytoplasmic tail of CD74. Human monocytic U937 cells infected with wild-type or
Vpu-defective HIV-1 and transfected cells showed that Vpu down modulated the
surface expression of mature MHC II molecules. The reduction in cell surface
mature MHC II molecules correlated with decreased antigen presentation to T cells
in culture. Thus, the Vpu protein also contributes to viral persistence by
attenuating immune responses during HIV infection. This report further
exemplifies the rich diversity and redundancy shown by HIV in immune evasion.
