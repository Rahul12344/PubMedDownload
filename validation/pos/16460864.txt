It is well established that HCV NS5A protein when expressed in mammalian cells
perturbs the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The protein
serine/threonine phosphatase 2A controls the phosphorylation of numerous proteins
involved in cell signaling and one characterized function is the regulation of
Ras-Raf mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. Our results
showed that expression of HCV NS5A protein stimulates phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
activity in cells, indicating the relevance of NS5A as a regulator of PP2A in
vivo. We found that transient expression of the full length NS5A protein in
different cell lines leads to a significant increase of the PP2A activity and
this activity is specifically inhibited by the addition of okadaic acid, a PP2A
inhibitor, in living cells. Further investigation showed that NS5A protein
interacts in vivo and in vitro with the scaffolding A and the catalytic C
subunits of PP2A. We propose that HCV NS5A represents a viral PP2A regulatory
protein. This is a novel function for the NS5A protein which may have a key role 
in the ability of the virus to deregulate cell growth and survival.
