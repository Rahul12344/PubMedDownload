Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV or CD26) is a multifunctional membrane
glycoprotein. As an exopeptidase it regulates the activity of a series of
biologically important peptides. Through its interaction with specific proteins
and peptides, DPPIV is also involved in a wide range of biologically relevant
processes such as cell adhesion, T cell activation and apoptosis. In this paper, 
we review our recent studies on the interactions of DPPIV with adenosine
deaminase (ADA) and the transcription transactivator of the human
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1 Tat) as revealed by three-dimensional
structure reconstructed by single particle analysis of cryo-electron microscopy
(EM) and crystal structures of the human DPPIV-bovine ADA complex as well as the 
crystal structures of DPPIV in complex with HIV-1 Tat-derived nonapeptides. These
results contribute importantly to the clarification of the molecular mechanisms
of this multifunctional protein. The biological relevance of these interactions
is discussed.
