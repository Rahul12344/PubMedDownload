Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated
nuclear antigen (LANA) protein has been reported to interact with glycogen
synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and to negatively regulate its activity,
leading to stimulation of GSK-3beta-dependent beta-catenin degradation. We show
here that the I-mfa domain proteins, HIC (human I-mfa domain-containing protein) 
and I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family a), interacted in vivo with LANA through
their C-terminal I-mfa domains. This interaction affected the intracellular
localization of HIC, inhibited the LANA-dependent transactivation of a
beta-catenin-regulated reporter construct, and decreased the level of the
LANA.GSK-3beta complex. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain
proteins interact with LANA and negatively regulate LANA-mediated activation of
Wnt signaling-dependent transcription by inhibiting the formation of the
LANA.GSK-3beta complex.
