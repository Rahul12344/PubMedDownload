BACKGROUND: Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is considered to be a satellite virus of 
the Hepatitis B virus. The genome consists of a 1679 nt ssRNA molecule in which a
single ORF was identified. This ORF codes for a unique protein, the Delta antigen
(HDAg). During transcription, two forms, small (S-HDAg; p24) and large (L-HDAg;
p27) of this antigen are derived as a result of an editing mechanism catalyzed by
cellular adenosine deaminase 1. Despite its simplicity, little is still known
about the host factors that interact with the virus RNA and antigens being to
modulate virus replication.
METHODS: A yeast two-hybrid screening of a human liver cDNA library, using the
hepatitis delta virus (HDV) small antigen (S-HDAg) as bait, was performed. Blot
overlay and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used in an attempt to confirm the 
interaction of hnRNPC and S-HDAg. siRNA knockdown assays of hnRNPC were performed
to assess the effect on HDV antigen expression.
RESULTS: Thirty known proteins were identified as S-HDAg interactors in the yeast
two-hybrid screening. One of the identified proteins, hnRNPC, was found to
interact with S-HDAg in vitro and in vivo in human liver cells. The interaction
of the two proteins is mediated by the C-terminal half of the S-HDAg which
contains a RNA-binding domain (aa 98-195). HDV RNA, S-HDAg, and hnRNPC, were also
found to co-localize in the nucleus of human liver cells. Knockdown of hnRNPC
mRNA using siRNAs resulted in a marked decreased expression of HDV antigens.
CONCLUSIONS: S-HDAg was found to interact with human liver proteins previously
assigned to different functional categories. Among those involved in nucleic acid
metabolism, hnRNPC was found to interact in vitro and in vivo in human liver
cells. Similar to other RNA viruses, it seems plausible that hnRNPC may also be
involved in HDV replication. However, further investigation is mandatory to
clarify this question.
