The E6 protein from high-risk human papillomavirus types interacts with and
degrades several PDZ domain-containing proteins that localize to adherens
junctions or tight junctions in polarized epithelial cells. We have identified
the tight junction-associated multi-PDZ protein PATJ (PALS1-associated TJ
protein) as a novel binding partner and degradation target of high-risk types 16 
and 18 E6. PATJ functions in the assembly of the evolutionarily conserved
CRB-PALS1-PATJ and Par6-aPKC-Par3 complexes and is critical for the formation of 
tight junctions in polarized cells. The ability of type 18 E6 full-length to bind
to, and the subsequent degradation of, PATJ is dependent on its C-terminal PDZ
binding motif. We demonstrate that the spliced 18 E6* protein, which lacks a
C-terminal PDZ binding motif, associates with and degrades PATJ independently of 
full-length 18 E6. Thus, PATJ is the first binding partner that is degraded in
response to both isoforms of 18 E6. The ability of E6 to utilize a non-E6AP
ubiquitin ligase for the degradation of several PDZ binding partners has been
suggested. We also demonstrate that 18 E6-mediated degradation of PATJ is not
inhibited in cells where E6AP is silenced by shRNA. This suggests that the
E6-E6AP complex is not required for the degradation of this protein target.
