The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses downregulates the cell surface expression
of CD4 through a two-step process. First, Nef connects the cytoplasmic tail of
CD4 with adaptor protein complexes (AP), thereby inducing the formation of
CD4-specific clathrin-coated pits that rapidly endocytose the viral receptor.
Second, Nef targets internalized CD4 molecules for degradation. Here we show that
Nef accomplishes this second task by acting as a connector between CD4 and the
beta subunit of COPI coatomers in endosomes. A sequence encompassing a critical
acidic dipeptide, located nearby but distinct from the AP-binding determinant of 
HIV-1 Nef, is responsible for beta-COP recruitment and for routing to lysosomes. 
A novel class of endosomal sorting motif, based on acidic residues, is thus
revealed, and beta-COP is identified as its downstream partner.
