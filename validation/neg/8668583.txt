The hepatitis C virus is the main causative agent for sporadic as well as
parenteral cases of non-A non-B hepatitis. Alpha interferon is a biologically
active protein produced by B lymphocytes and monocytes which can be manufactured 
by recombinant DNA technology. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with interferon
in adults is associated with a sustained response in 20-25% of treated cases.
First studies provide encouraging results for the use of interferon in the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C in children, but controlled trials using this
drug in a larger population of children are needed.
