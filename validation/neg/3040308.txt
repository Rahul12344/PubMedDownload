A single cell assay for the study of gamma-interferon formation in leprosy
patients.

Lindh J, Anderson U, Britton S, De Ley M.

The number of gamma-interferon producing cells in the peripheral blood of leprosy
(LL and BT) patients and controls was studied by the reversed protein A plaque
assay before and after exposure in vitro to Mycobacterium leprae bacilli and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The level of spontaneous gamma-interferon production
was significantly higher in BT patients compared to LL patients and controls.
Mycobacterium leprae induced a specific gamma-interferon response in lymphocytes 
from BT patients and from healthy contacts whereas in LL patients and non-exposed
controls the response was low or non-existing. There were no significant
differences in the gamma-interferon response to EBV between the above groups.
