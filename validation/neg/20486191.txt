The storage conditions of blood samples for reliable results are very important
in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA amplification tests used in routine HCV analyses. 
According to many studies, storage conditions could affect the RNA stability for 
HCV RNA detection. We have studied HCV RNA stability in blood samples stored at 4
degrees C. Nineteen blood samples containing different HCV RNA levels were stored
at 4 degrees C and they were then analyzed by TaqMAN real-time PCR method. HCV
RNA levels remained almost stable (100%) at least for five weeks at this storage 
condition. However, among them, the stability period was up to 11 weeks in two of
the samples. As with these findings, there was a slightly significant correlation
between the positivity time and the beginning HCV RNA levels (r=0.474, P=0.040). 
We conclude that, blood samples can be stored at 4 degrees C for five weeks
without any significant difference in detected HCV RNA level by using TaqMan
real-time PCR.
