Two continuously growing in vito cell lines, PB-1049 and LN-1049, were
established from a patient with Ph1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in
extramedullary blastic crisis. PB-1049 was established from Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-infected peripheral lymphocytes of the patient and had a 46,XY,t(9;22)
karyotype. This cell line was shown to be tumorigenic in nude mice, and cultured 
cells recovered from the tumor nodule showed a 46,XY,6p+,t(9;22) stem line
karyotype. LN-1049 was derived from a lymph node culture of the same patient, and
was found to be non-tumorigenic in nude mice and karyotypically normal.
Immunological examinations on EBV-induced antigens, surface and cytoplasmic
immunoglobulin, and monoclonal antibodies, and some enzymatic and electron
microscopic studies revealed that both cell lines had attained differentiation
into late-B cell stage.
