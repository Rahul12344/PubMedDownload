CNS disease following dissemination of SSPE measles virus from intraperitoneal
inoculation of suckling hamsters.

Carrigan DR, McKendall RR, Johnson KP.

Acute encephalitis was observed in suckling Golden Syrian hamsters following
intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of a hamster brain adapted strain of subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) measles virus (HBS). Virus was isolated from
the brains of all encephalitic animals by cocultivation of tissue with Vero
cells. The histopathology of the encephalitis was characterized by perivascular
mononuclear infiltrates, necrosis, eosinophilic inclusion bodies, and rare giant 
cells. Association of encephalitis with systemic viral infection was observed
with virus present in lung and a kidney-spleen pool in addition to brain. Viral
dissemination in asymptomatic animals was documented with virus being isolated
from multiple non-neural tissues (spleen, lung, liver) of animals having no
recoverable virus in their brains and no signs of encephalitis. Treatment of
animals with cyclophosphamide prior to ip virus inoculation did not increase
dissemination to brain. Absence of encephalitis in asymptomatic animals with
proven viral dissemination to parenchymal organs indicates that neither viremia
alone, nor viremia in conjunction with dissemination are sufficient conditions to
establish central nervous system disease. The association of encephalitis with
systemic viral infection and the dissemination to brain establish this model's
potential value for the study of the pathogenesis of measles encephalitis.
