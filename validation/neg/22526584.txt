BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus infects ~3% of the population and it is a risk
factor for hepatocarcinogenesis. The epigenetic mechanisms of HCV-induced
hepatocyte transformation towards malignancy in this context are unclear.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of HCV core proteins
of different genotypes on DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) induction.
MATERIALS/METHODS: We investigated DNMT1, DNMT3b and E-Cadherin (CDH1) mRNA and
protein expression levels in an in vitro model of Huh-7 cells expressing the HCV 
core protein of different genotypes: 1b, 2a, 3a, 4h and 5a.
RESULTS: We found that both mRNA and protein expression levels of DNMT1 and 3b
were upregulated in genotype 1b HCV core expressing cells as compared to control 
cells. DNMT3b mRNA levels did not change in genotypes 2a, 3a, 4h and 5a, but were
upregulated at the protein level by genotype 1b, 2a, 3a. CDH1 mRNA expression was
downregulated only in genotype 1b, whereas its protein expression resulted in
downregulation by the HCV core of genotypes 1b, 2a and 3a. Conversely, no
significant changes were observed for DNMTs and CDH1 investigated in Huh-7 cells 
expressing the genotypes 4h and 5a. Furthermore, we present evidence that HCV
core 1b protein expression induces DNMTs overexpression through STAT3 protein as 
demonstrated by NSC74859 treatment. Moreover, SIRT1 inhibition affected DNMT1 and
3b expression only in HCV core protein genotype 1b expressing cells as
demonstrated by treatment with its inhibitor sirtinol.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HCV core protein could play a role in HCC 
development at least in part by altering DNMTs expression.
