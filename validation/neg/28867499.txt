BACKGROUND: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) coadministered with two
nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are recommended
as first-line treatment for HIV, and coformulated fixed-dose combinations are
preferred to facilitate adherence. We report 48-week results from a study
comparing initial HIV-1 treatment with bictegravir-a novel INSTI with a high
in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of
clinically relevant drug interactions-coformulated with the NRTI combination
emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination to
dolutegravir administered with coformulated emtricitabine and tenofovir
alafenamide.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled,
non-inferiority trial, HIV-infected adults were screened and enrolled at 126
outpatient centres in 10 countries in Australia, Europe, Latin America, and North
America. Participants were previously untreated adults (HIV-1 RNA ≥500 copies per
mL) with estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min. Chronic
hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C co-infection was allowed. We randomly assigned
participants (1:1) to receive oral fixed-dose combination bictegravir 50 mg,
emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or dolutegravir 50 mg with 
coformulated emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg, with matching 
placebo, once a day for 144 weeks. Investigators, participants, study staff, and 
those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment group. All participants who
received at least one dose of study drug were included in primary efficacy and
safety analyses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with
plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 (US Food and Drug
Administration snapshot algorithm), with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of
-12%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02607956.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 11, 2015, and July 15, 2016, 742 participants were screened
for eligibility, of whom 657 were randomly assigned to treatment (327 with
bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fixed-dose combination
[bictegravir group] and 330 with dolutegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir
alafenamide [dolutegravir group]). 320 participants who received the bictegravir 
regimen and 325 participants who received the dolutegravir regimen were included 
in the primary efficacy analyses. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL was
achieved in 286 (89%) of 320 participants in the bictegravir group and 302 (93%) 
of 325 in the dolutegravir group (difference -3·5%, 95·002% CI -7·9 to 1·0,
p=0·12), showing non-inferiority of the bictegravir regimen to the dolutegravir
regimen. No treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug was observed.
Incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between groups, and few
participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events (5 [2%] of 320 in the
bictegravir group and 1 [<1%] 325 in the dolutegravir group). Study drug-related 
adverse events were less common in the bictegravir group than in the dolutegravir
group (57 [18%] of 320 vs 83 [26%] of 325, p=0·022).
INTERPRETATION: At 48 weeks, virological suppression with the bictegravir regimen
was achieved and was non-inferior to the dolutegravir regimen in previously
untreated adults. There was no emergent resistance to either regimen. The
fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide
was safe and well tolerated compared with the dolutegravir regimen.
