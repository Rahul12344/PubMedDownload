The dengue viruses (DENV) are endemic in the tropical and sub-tropical countries 
and cause the most common arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. Travelers
visiting endemic areas may both acquire and spread DENV infections, and this is
the reason why prevention of mosquito bites is of crucial importance. Dengue
fever (DF) has become the most common cause for tropical fever in Swedish
tourists. Swedish data from 1995 to 2010 show that the number of DF cases has
increased since the beginning of 2000; partly due to improved diagnostics based
on IgM detection, and partly due to an increase in the number of tourists
traveling to, and between, endemic areas. Young adults aged 20-29 are mostly
affected, and epidemiological data indicate increased incidence rates from 2008
onwards. Our data pose a call for attention when traveling to DENV endemic areas 
as well as an increased awareness among physicians when treating returning
travelers.
