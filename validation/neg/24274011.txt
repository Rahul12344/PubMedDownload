EnBase (BioSilta, Finland) is a microbial cultivation system that replicates
fed-batch systems through sustained release of glucose by enzymatic degradation
of a polymeric substrate. Achievable bacterial cell densities and recombinant
capripoxvirus protein expression levels, solubility, and antigenicity using the
EnBase system were assessed. BL21-AI Escherichia coli expressing capripoxvirus
proteins achieved up to eightfold higher cell densities when grown in EnBase
media compared with standard media. Greater yields of capripoxvirus proteins were
attained using EnBase media, either through increases in the amount of expressed 
protein per cell in conjunction with higher cell density or through the increase 
in cell density alone. Addition of EnBase booster enhanced protein yield for one 
of the proteins tested but reduced yield for the other. However, the amount of
soluble forms of the capripoxvirus proteins tested was not different from that
observed from cultures grown under standard conditions. Purified capripoxvirus
proteins expressed using EnBase or standard media were assessed for their
performance by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were shown to be
equally capable of specifically binding capripoxvirus antibodies.
