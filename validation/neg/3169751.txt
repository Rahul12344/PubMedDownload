To assess the value of serological tests in diagnosing and monitoring the
response to treatment of syphilis in patients infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), case notes of eight homosexual men with a history
of treated syphilis, positive reactions to serological tests for syphilis, and
documented subsequent conversion to HIV seropositivity were studied. No change
was noted in serological markers of syphilis after HIV infection. The case notes 
of one man with primary syphilis, four men with secondary syphilis, and three men
with latent syphilis, of whom all were HIV seropositive, were also studied. In
seven of these patients the serological responses to infection and after
treatment were consistent with the experience of syphilis in HIV seronegative
patients. In one man treated for secondary syphilis, and confirmed as HIV
seropositive eight months after treatment, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test
result continued to be positive at a high titre for up to 20 months after
treatment.
