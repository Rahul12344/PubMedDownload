The typical bullet shape of Rhabdoviruses is thought to rely on the matrix
protein for stabilizing the nucleocapsid coil. Here we scrutinize the morphology 
of purified and recombinant nucleocapsids of vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro.
We elucidate pH and ionic strength conditions for their folding into conical tips
and further growth into whole bullets, and provide cryo-electron microscopy
reconstructions of the bullet tip and the helical trunk. We address
conformational variability of the reconstituted nucleocapsids and the issue of
constraints imposed by the binding of matrix protein. Our findings bridge the gap
between the isolated nucleoprotein-RNA string in its form of an undulating
ribbon, and the tight bullet-shaped virion skeleton.
