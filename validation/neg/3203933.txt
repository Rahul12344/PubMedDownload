Fifty seven patients experiencing first attacks of genital herpes simplex virus
infection (HSVI) were compared with 50 patients who were concerned about
frequently recurring attacks despite routine counselling and reassurance. Using
the general health questionnaire this latter group was found to be more
psychologically distressed and more socially naive than the first attack group,
as measured by socioeconomic class and the lie score of the Eysenck personality
questionnaire; otherwise the two groups were similar. Patients presenting to
clinics with frequently recurring genital HSVI may therefore be especially
psychologically distressed, socially naive, and disadvantaged. Managing these
patients needs to include understanding these problems as well as giving advice
and using antiviral agents.
