BACKGROUND: Early childhood wheezing substantially impacts quality of life in
high-income countries, but data are sparse on early childhood wheezing in
low-income countries. We estimate wheezing incidence, describe wheezing
phenotypes, and explore the contribution of respiratory viral illnesses among
children aged <5 years in urban Bangladesh.
METHODS: During 2004-2010, respiratory illness surveillance was conducted through
weekly home visits. Children with fever or respiratory illness were referred for 
examination by study physicians including lung auscultation. During 2005-2007,
every fifth referred child had nasal washes tested for human metapneumovirus,
respiratory syncytial viruses, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses.
RESULTS: During April 2004-July 2010, 23,609 children were enrolled in
surveillance. Of these, 11,912 (50%) were male, median age at enrollment was 20
months (IQR 5-38), and 4,711 (20%) had ≥1 wheezing episode accounting for 8,901
episodes (733 [8%] associated with hospitalization); 25% wheezed at <1 year of
age. Among children aged <5 years, incidences of wheezing and wheezing
hospitalizations were 2,335/10,000 and 192/10,000 child-years. Twenty-eight
percent had recurrent wheezing. Recurrent versus non-recurrent wheezing episodes 
were more likely to be associated with oxygen saturation <93% (OR 6.9, 95%CI
2.8-17.3), increased work of breathing (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.4-1.8), and
hospitalization (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.6-2.4). Respiratory viruses were detected in 66%
(578/873) of episodes with testing.
CONCLUSION: In urban Bangladesh, early childhood wheezing is common and largely
associated with respiratory virus infections. Recurrent wheezing is associated
with more severe illness and may predict children who would benefit most from
closer follow-up and targeted interventions. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:588-595. ©
