This review describes the proposed mechanism(s) of classical virus
cross-protection in plants, followed by those suggested for coat protein-mediated
resistance (CP-mediated resistance). Although both have common features,
cross-protection is thought to be a complex response caused by the replication
and expression of the entire viral genome, whereas the resistance conferred by
the expression of a virus coat protein gene is more limited. The term genetically
engineered cross-protection is frequently used because in many cases the
phenotype of resistance mimics that of cross-protection. However, CP-mediated
resistance, although a narrow term, more accurately describes the resistance that
results from the expression of a virus CP gene in transgenic plants.
