Proper sampling is essential to characterize the molecular epidemiology of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV sampling frames are difficult to identify, so
most studies use convenience samples. We discuss statistically valid and feasible
sampling techniques that overcome some of the potential for bias due to
convenience sampling and ensure better representation of the study population. We
employ a sampling design called stratified cluster sampling. This first divides
the population into geographical and/or social strata. Within each stratum, a
population of clusters is chosen from groups, locations, or facilities where
HIV-positive individuals might be found. Some clusters are randomly selected
within strata and individuals are randomly selected within clusters. Variation
and cost help determine the number of clusters and the number of individuals
within clusters that are to be sampled. We illustrate the approach through a
study designed to survey the heterogeneity of subtype B strains in Honduras.
