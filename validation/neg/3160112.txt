Staphylococcal enterotoxin A is encoded by phage.

Betley MJ, Mekalanos JJ.

The gene for staphylococcal enterotoxin A (entA), in two wild-type strains, is
carried by related temperate bacteriophages. Hybridization analysis of DNA from
entA-converting phage PS42-D and its bacterial host suggests that this phage
integrates into the bacterial chromosome by circularization and reciprocal
crossover (the Campbell model) and that the entA gene is located near the phage
attachment site. DNA from three of eight staphylococcal strains that did not
produce enterotoxin A and seven wild-type enterotoxin A-producing (EntA+) strains
had extensive homology to the entA-converting phage PS42-D DNA, although there
was a high degree of restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. At least one
EntA+ strain did not produce detectable viable phage after induction. These data 
indicate that a polymorphic family of Staphylococcus aureus phages (some of which
may be defective) can carry the entA gene.
