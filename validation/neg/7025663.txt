Morphogenesis of yellow fever virus in Aedes aegypti cultured cells. I. Isolation
of different cellular clones and the study of their susceptibility to infection
with the virus.

Deubel V, Digoutte JP.

We report the isolation of 19 cellular clones of Aedes aegypti and analyze their 
susceptibility to infection with yellow fever virus, in comparison with the
uncloned cells. Four types of clones were found, different in their morphology,
their metabolism and their virus production. The C 17 clone produces the most
virus, not only with respect to the other Aedes aegypti clones, but also to other
uncloned arthropod cells published in the literature. A cytopathic effect exists 
in the virus infected cells. Cloned and uncloned cells do not seem to produce any
antiviral substance which transfers to other cells an immunity against the virus.
An immunological study with immunoperoxidase enabled us to follow the appearance 
of viral antigens and to locate them in the cell. At the beginning we observed a 
perinuclear coloration diffusing further into the whole cytoplasm. The present
report represents an introduction to a structural study on the morphogenesis of
yellow fever virus within the cells of Aedes aegypti.
