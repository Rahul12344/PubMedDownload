The advent of tolerable, efficacious therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV)
creates an opportunity to provide HCV treatment for individuals experiencing
homelessness. A federally-qualified community health center serving individuals
experiencing homelessness in Boston conducted an anonymous needs assessment
survey of a sample of HCV-infected patients in order to inform development of an 
HCV treatment program (N = 240). Primary care providers (PCPs) were identified as
the chief source of HCV education. Main motivators to consider HCV treatment were
identified as "taking care of your health" (73.5%) and "your provider says you
should get treated" (53.6%). Interest and confidence to complete HCV treatment
were high. The majority of respondents (51.4%) preferred to receive HCV treatment
in the primary care setting. Preference for PCP-based treatment was significant
compared to liver specialty-based treatment (30.8%, p &lt; .0001). This is the
first assessment of its kind describing the preferences of homeless individuals
concerning hepatitis C treatment.
