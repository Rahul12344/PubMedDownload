To clarify the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in renal transplant
recipients and to estimate the role of TTV in patients with post-transplant liver
function abnormalities, TTV-DNA of 47 renal transplant recipients was screened by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to a method described by Okamoto et al.
before and after the renal transplantation. One of them was positive for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), one was positive for anti-hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) and other 45 were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HCV. TTV-DNA was
detected in 22 of 47 patients before renal transplantation, and nine became
positive after transplantation. All 47 patients showed a normal level of ALT
before transplantation. Three of nine (33%) who became positive for TTV-DNA after
transplantation and three of 16 (19%) who were negative for TTV-DNA before and
after transplantation showed transient elevation of ALT. These results indicate
that TTV was highly prevalent among renal transplant recipients, but a clear
association between TTV and post-transplant liver function abnormality was not
found.
