We have examined the ribosomal protein kinase activities in partially purified
cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus. We found an
activity or activities, absent from mock-infected cells, that was capable of
phosphorylating the proteins S2 and S13 in vitro. The ribosomes phosphorylated in
vitro exhibited the same multiple phosphorylation of S2 found in vivo, at least 3
phosphoryl residues being seen, and the same mono-phosphorylation of S13. Also as
in vivo, ribosomal protein S2 contained phosphothreonine as well as
phosphoserine, whereas S13 contained only phosphoserine. This strongly suggests
that these new protein kinase activities are responsible for the ribosomal
protein phosphorylations that occur during infection with vaccinia virus.
