Sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was studied in 30 partners to
anti-HCV positive multitransfused patients with a bleeding disorder. Anti-HCV
ELISA C-100 was used as a screening test. Positive results were confirmed with
the first generation RIBA test. Indeterminate samples were tested also with the
second generation RIBA to verify the positivity. The time of sexual exposure
added up was at least 95 years. 29 partners were anti-HCV seronegative. Only 1
partner was anti-HCV indeterminate. Thus sexual transmission of HCV was a rare
event.
