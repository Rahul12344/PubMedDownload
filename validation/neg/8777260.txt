Human papillomavirus-related anogenital neoplasia is an active area of basic and 
clinical research. The research topics are broad based, but mostly are focused on
delineating the clinical utility of human papillomavirus testing, the natural
history of human papillomavirus infections and associated premalignancies,
characterization of the oncogenic role of human papillomavirus in sites other
than the uterine cervix, and the mechanisms of human papillomavirus-associated
carcinogenesis.
