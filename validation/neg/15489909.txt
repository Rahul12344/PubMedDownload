More than a quarter of a century has elapsed since the identification of the
c-src proto-oncogene. During that period, we have learned that cancer arises as
the result of mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and we are
now seeing the first fruits of these discoveries, in the form of targeted
therapies directed against activated tyrosine kinases such as Bcr-Abl, c-Kit and 
the EGF receptor. But the discovery of the c-src proto-oncogene was in turn based
on decades of study on an avian RNA tumor virus, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Here I
review the work that led up to the identification of the RSV transforming gene
and its protein product, and how this information in turn led to the discovery of
cellular Src.
