PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent progress in elucidating the physiopathology of X-linked
lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) has raised novel and important issues
regarding the biology of natural killer T cells. Here I will review this
information and discuss the issues involved.
RECENT FINDINGS: XLP is a rare inherited immunodeficiency characterized by a high
susceptibility to severe infection by the Epstein-Barr virus. Mutations in the
gene SH2D1A (or alternatively SAP) underlie 80% of familial XLP (XLP-1) cases.
Recently the remaining 20% of familial XLP (XLP-2) cases were shown to harbor
mutations in the gene XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein). Both SAP
and XIAP deficiencies are associated with a defect in the development and/or
homeostasis of natural killer T cells.
SUMMARY: It can be hypothesized that the susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus in 
XLP might result from the defect of natural killer T cells. The role of these
cells in viral infection is unclear, but several herpes viruses have developed
strategies to escape natural killer T cells. The discovery that SAP and XIAP
deficiency leads to a defect in natural killer T cells has also shed light on
novel signaling pathways required for natural killer T cell development and/or
homeostasis.
