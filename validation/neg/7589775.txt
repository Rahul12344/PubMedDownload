A patient with chronic hepatitis type C, confirmed by the detection of hepatitis 
C virus RNA (HCV RNA) in the serum and by histological examination of the liver
biopsy specimen, was treated with four courses of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha).
For the first three courses of IFN-alpha the patient's serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) level normalized during the administration of IFN-alpha
but rose again after its cessation; similarly, HCV RNA was absent from the serum 
by the end of each course of treatment but could be detected once again after
treatment stopped. The fourth course of IFN-alpha therapy, however, produced a
sustained normalization of the ALT level and sustained absence of HCV RNA from
the serum for 20 months after the end of treatment. This case suggests that
patients with the potential for an eventual complete response to IFN-alpha
therapy may show a normalization of serum ALT levels during IFN-alpha
administration and the absence of HCV RNA in the serum by the end of each course 
of treatment (even if that particular course of treatment does not produce a
sustained response).
