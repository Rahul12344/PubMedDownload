With the advent of all oral direct-acting antiviral drugs with a broad range of
genotypic activity and a low incidence of side effects, we are entering an
exciting new era in the therapeutics of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, it is
not yet clear who will benefit from these innovations: Will the advantages be
limited to HCV patients in industrialized nations or could the whole community of
HCV-infected individuals be given access to treatment? As the majority of people 
infected with HCV live in resource-limited settings it is important to overcome
the barriers that restrict access to treatment in these areas. Drug costs, public
and professional education, simplified diagnostics, and political imperative all 
need to be addressed before the majority of HCV-infected individuals can benefit 
from the new generation of HCV antivirals.
