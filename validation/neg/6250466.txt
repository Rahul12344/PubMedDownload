Antiviral activity of tunicamycin on herpes simplex virus.

Katz E, Margalith E, Duksin D.

Tunicamycin (0.5 microgram/ml) significantly lowers (2 to 3 log10) the infectious
yield of herpes simplex virus type 1 grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts and in
BSC1 cells. Although virus particles are formed and the synthesis of the viral
deoxyribonucleic acid is only partially affected by the antibiotic, the
glycosylation of herpesvirus glycopeptides is amost completely inhibited. The
morphology of virus particles made in the presence of tunicamycin is similar to
that of intact virus particles, as demonstrated by electron microscopy. This
suggests that the absence of the carbohydrate side-chain from the viral
glycopeptides does not affect the overall integrity of the virion but decreases
very significantly the infectivity of these particles.
