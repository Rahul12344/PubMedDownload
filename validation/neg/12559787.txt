Cytotoxic T cell responses are key to the control of intracellular pathogens
including HIV-1. In particular, HIV-1 vaccines based on regulatory proteins, such
as Tat, are aimed at controlling HIV-1 replication and at blocking disease
development by inducing cytotoxic T cell responses. Naked DNA is capable of
inducing such responses but it requires several inoculations of high amounts of
DNA, and/or prime-boost regimens. Here, we show that a novel class of cationic
block copolymers protect the DNA from DNAse I digestion, and improve DNA delivery
to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) after intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination. In
particular, three cationic block copolymers (K1, K2 and K5) were used to deliver 
the HIV-1 pCV-tat DNA vaccine in BALB/c mice. The results indicate that
vaccination with a very low dose (1 microg) of pCV-tat delivered by the cationic 
block copolymer K2 is safe and, as compared to naked DNA (up to 30 microg),
greatly increases the CTL response against Tat, which was detected in all animals
in the absence or in the presence of re-stimulation.
