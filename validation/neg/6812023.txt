Periodicity in the length of 3'-poly(A) tails from native globin mRNA of rabbit.

Kelly JM, Cox RA.

Globin mRNA from rabbit reticulocytes was labelled at the 3'-end with [5'-32P]pCp
by T4 RNA ligase. The 3'-poly(A) tail was released by digestion of mRNA with T1
ribonuclease and its size distribution determined by gel electrophoresis and
autoradiography. The length of the 3'-poly(A) tails varied from about 15-150
residues, but the size distribution exhibited peaks in the abundance of poly(A)
species at intervals of approx. 25 residues. This periodicity appears to reflect 
the manner in which proteins bind to the 3'-poly(A) tail. The function of such
regular interactions may be to control mRNA breakdown in the cytoplasm.
