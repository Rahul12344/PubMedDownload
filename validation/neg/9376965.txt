The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) responsible for AIDS is reaching epidemic 
proportions in the United States and Europe. As new therapeutic modalities
against HIV are uncovered and applied to treat prophylactically asymptomatic and 
therapeutically symptomatic HIV positive patients, imaging studies are no longer 
used just to characterize the organic-morphologic effects of HIV and
opportunistic infections and neoplasms. This article discusses the current
applications and contribution of nuclear medicine to the management of
neurologically symptomatic HIV-positive patients.
