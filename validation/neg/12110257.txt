The implementation of influenza vaccination programs emphasize the necessity of
an extended influenza surveillance in the countries of the region. As it is based
on the activity of National Influenza Centers we intend to make a description of 
their work, their historical background and further development. Technical
capacities in influenza South America laboratories, and networks in Argentina,
Brazil and Chile are shown. Examples of different viral circulation in a unique
country or in countries with common borders illustrate the importance of the
information obtained by means of the virological surveillance. Specific
characteristics of the region as long distances and the lack of modern
information systems require a suitable fitting of the systems that are working in
Northern Hemisphere countries. The contribution of motivated physicians and
public health workers must not to be disregarded. The following actions are
proposed: optimizing technical capacities of National Influenza Centers in order 
to improve the quality of data available; improving the communication of the
information obtained by surveillance activities to all the participants;
increasing the cooperation among the countries; motivate health authorities to
become aware of influenza impact in public health.
