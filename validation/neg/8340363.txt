A stable, non-peptide inhibitor of the protease from type 1 human
immunodeficiency virus has been developed, and the stereochemistry of binding
defined through crystallographic three-dimensional structure determination. The
initial compound, haloperidol, was discovered through computational screening of 
the Cambridge Structural Database using a shape complementarity algorithm. The
subsequent modification is a non-peptidic lateral lead, which belongs to a family
of compounds with well characterized pharmacological properties. This thioketal
derivative of haloperidol and a halide counterion are bound within the enzyme
active site in a mode distinct from the observed for peptide-based inhibitors. A 
variant of the protease cocrystallized with this inhibitor shows binding in the
manner predicted during the initial computer-based search. The structures provide
the context for subsequent synthetic modifications of the inhibitor.
