[Pseudomonas bacteriophage phiKZ--possible model for studying the genetic control
of morphogenesis].

[Article in Russian]

Krylov VN, Zhazykov IZh.

A description of structure and some bilogical properties of a new virulent
Pseudomonas phage, phiKZ, is given in the paper. Phage phiKZ has unique
characteristics of particle (a large size of the head and the presence in the
head of a structure which is visible on electron micrographs as crosswise
striated substance). A cause of high-titer phage phiKZ formation on plates has
been investigated. Characteristics of single step growth experiments, sensitivity
of free phage particles to heating, SDS-treatment, UV-light, cycles of
freezing-thawing, osmotic shocking are determined. No exclusion is found of
homologous phage at early stages of infection bacteria with phiKZ. Mutants of
phiKZ with changed plaque morphology are isolated; the possibility of a
recombination between the mutants is demonstrated. It is supposed that phage
phiKZ may be used as excellent model for the study of genetic control of
morphogenesis and packing of DNA in the phage head.
