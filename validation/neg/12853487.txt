A unique right end-enhancer complex precedes synapsis of Mu ends: the enhancer is
sequestered within the transpososome throughout transposition.

Assembly of the Mu transpososome is dependent on interactions of transposase
subunits with the left (L) and right (R) ends of Mu and an enhancer (E). We have 
followed the order and dynamics of association of these sites within a series of 
transpososomes prior to and during formation of a three-site complex (LER),
engagement of Mu ends by the transposase active site (type 0 complex), cleavage
of the ends (type I complex) and their transfer to target DNA (type II complex). 
LER appears to be preceded by a two-site complex (ER) where E and R are
interwrapped twice, as in the mature transpososome. At each stage thereafter, the
overall topology of five DNA supercoils is retained: two between E and R, one
between E and L and two between L and R. However, L-R interactions within LER
appear to be flexible. Unexpectedly, the enhancer was seen to persist within the 
transpososome through cleavage and strand transfer of Mu ends to target DNA.
