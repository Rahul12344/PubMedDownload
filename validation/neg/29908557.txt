Bentysrepinine (Y101), a derivative of phenyalanine dipeptide, has a novel
mechanism in the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a good
anti-HBV effect. In the present study, a fluorometric-based high throughput
method using cytochrome P450 (CYP) screening kit was adopted to evaluate in vitro
inhibition potential of Y101 on CYP isoenzymes by calculating remaining enzyme
activities and inhibitory potential (IC(50) values) using the determined values
of fluorescence intensity. The result showed that Y101 exhibited little activity 
in the inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (IC(50) > 100
μmol·L(-1)). Y101 was used to treat human primary hepotocytes for 72 h, and the
enzyme activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 were determined with a cocktail of
probe substrates for the three CYP isoforms. The metabolites were simultaneously 
determined using a LC-MS/MS method. Y101 had no activity in the induction of
CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 on the basis of the following results: 1 The ratio of
enzyme activities between test and control groups were all below than 1 (varied
from 0.662 to 0.928); 2 The induction potential of Y101 were lower than forty
percent compared with that of positive groups. The above results suggest that
Y101 has little activity in the regulation of metabolic drug-drug interactions
based on the CYP isoform changes following co-administration of drugs.
