Self-cleaving ribozymes were discovered 30 years ago and have been found
throughout nature, from bacteria to animals, but little is known about their
biological functions and regulation, particularly how cofactors and metabolites
alter their activity. A hepatitis delta virus-like self-cleaving ribozyme maps
upstream of a phosphoglucosamine mutase (glmM) open reading frame in the genome
of the human gut bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The presence of a
ribozyme in the untranslated region of glmM suggests a regulation mechanism of
gene expression. In the bacterial hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, the enzyme
glmM catalyzes the isomerization of glucosamine 6-phosphate into glucosamine
1-phosphate. In this study, we investigated the effect of these metabolites on
the co-transcriptional self-cleavage rate of the ribozyme. Our results suggest
that glucosamine 6-phosphate, but not glucosamine 1-phosphate, is an allosteric
ligand that increases the self-cleavage rate of drz-Fpra-1, providing the first
known example of allosteric modulation of a self-cleaving ribozyme by the
substrate of the adjacent gene product. Given that the ribozyme is activated by
the glmM substrate, but not the product, this allosteric modulation may represent
a potential feed-forward mechanism of gene expression regulation in bacteria.
