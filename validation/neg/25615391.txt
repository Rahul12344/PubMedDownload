We show that a single DNA molecule confined and extended in a nanochannel can be 
dynamically compressed by sliding a permeable gasket at a fixed velocity relative
to the stationary polymer. The gasket is realized experimentally by optically
trapping a nanosphere inside a nanochannel. The trapped bead acts like a
"nanodozer," directly applying compressive forces to the molecule without
requirement of chemical attachment. Remarkably, these strongly nonequilibrium
measurements can be quantified via a simple nonlinear convective-diffusion
formalism and yield insights into the local blob statistics, allowing us to
conclude that the compressed nanochannel-confined chain exhibits mean-field
behavior.
