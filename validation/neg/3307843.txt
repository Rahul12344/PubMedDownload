Sublethal doses of whole-body irradiation induced the elevation of zinc
protoporphyrin (ZPP). Experiments were conducted to determine if recovery from
radiomimetic drugs also resulted in elevation of ZPP. Daily injections with
hydroxyurea and other cytotoxic drugs for 10 days caused ZPP elevation and a dose
of radiation too low to cause ZPP elevation by itself caused ZPP elevation when
hydroxyurea was administered prior to irradiation. Friend leukemia virus also
brought about an elevation of ZPP. However, not all factors that increased
erythropoiesis brought about ZPP elevation. The elevated erythropoiesis in
response to hypoxia and the enhanced erythropoiesis that followed administration 
of folic acid to folic acid-deficient mice was not accompanied by ZPP elevation.
