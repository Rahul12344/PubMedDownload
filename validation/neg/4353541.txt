Further studies on the influence of steroids on viral infection in mice.

Giron DJ, Allen PT, Pindak FF, Schmidt JP.

Certain steroids have been reported to enhance experimental viral infections,
whereas others have little or no effect. Interference with the interferon system 
has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the viral infection-enhancing
(VIE) activity of hormones. In the present study, steroids (prednisolone,
progesterone, testosterone) which had no effect on MM virus infection
demonstrated VIE activity against Mayaro virus infection. It is suggested that
the VIE activity of a hormone may be dependent on the viral agent used for
challenge. Data are also presented which suggest that, in addition to
interference with the interferon system, the VIE activity of steroid hormones may
be the result of at least two other actions: (i) alteration of cell membranes;
(ii) stimulation of initial viral replication.
