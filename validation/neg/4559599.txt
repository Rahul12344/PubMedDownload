Location of promoter and operator sites in the biotin gene cluster of Escherichia
coli.

Cleary PP, Campbell A, Chang R.

Biotin independence in E. coli requires five closely linked genes, bioA, bioB,
bioF, bioC, and bioD. The residual gene activity of deletion mutants has been
studied by complementation and enzyme assays. Deletion of the left end of the
bioA gene does not impair expression of the remaining genes, but deletions from
the left extending into bioB abolish all gene expression. Nonsense mutations in
bioB reduce expression of bioC, bioF, and bioD. Therefore, the four genes, bioB, 
bioF, bioC, and bioD, are transcribed as a unit from left to right, from a
promotor located between bioA and bioB. Expression of the bio genes is
repressible by added biotin. Deletions removing the left end of bioA do not
affect repressibility of bioD. Therefore the operator, as well as the promoter,
lie to the right of bioA. One deletion that removes bioA, bioB, and bioF renders 
the bioD gene constitutive, presumably by fusion to an unknown operon. Therefore,
the operator lies to the left of bioC.
