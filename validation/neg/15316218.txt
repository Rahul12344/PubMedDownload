Bronchocentric granulomatosis is an unusual pathologic entity that is
characterized by a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation surrounding the
airways. The diagnosis is usually made retrospectively, after histopathologic
examination of an open-lung biopsy or resection of a pulmonary lesion. Although
the aetiology has not been fully elucidated, the current pathogenetic mechanism
is considered to be an immunologic reaction against endobronchial antigens, since
most patients exhibit signs of bronchial asthma, eosinophilia and allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. However, non-asthmatic patients may develop
bronchocentric granulomatosis without signs for endobronchial fungal infections, 
but probably as a consequence of other pulmonary infections. An 80-year-old
female patient presented with high fever and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and 
nodules. After extensive investigations and open-lung biopsy, the diagnosis
bronchocentric granulomatosis was established that was possibly associated with
an influenza-A virus infection. Treatment consisted of immunosuppressive drugs
(prednisone and cyclophosphamide), which led to complete clinical and
radiological recovery.
