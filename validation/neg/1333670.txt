Serum antibody (virus neutralisation, complement fixation, IgM and IgG) responses
to equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infection were measured in six foals which were
initially free from EHV-1 and EHV-4 infection and maternally-derived antibodies. 
Following primary infection, high titres of virus neutralisation and complement
fixation antibodies were detectable against EHV-1, however, corresponding
antibody levels against EHV-4 were low or inapparent, although the two viruses
share a number of cross-reactive epitopes. In addition, following the primary
infection with EHV-1, IgM levels increased before those of IgG, virus
neutralisation and complement fixation antibodies, peaked sooner and thereafter
declined. Stimulation of IgM levels was observed on secondary infection with
EHV-1 given 61 days later. In contrast, IgG, virus neutralisation and complement 
fixation antibodies following primary infection were more sustained and no
increase in their levels was observed on secondary infection. No consistent
changes in IgM or IgG levels were seen after administration of dexamethasone to
reactivate latent virus.
