BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer with lymphoid stroma (GCLS) is pathologically
characterized by poorly developed tubular structures with a prominent lymphocytic
infiltration. Its clinical and prognostic features differ in patients positive
and negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. This study analyzed the
expression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand-1
(PD-L1), and the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including
CD3+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as their prognostic significance in patients with 
GCLS.
METHODS: The study included 58 patients with GCLS (29 EBV+ and 29 EBV-) who
underwent curative resection. Expression of CD3, CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 in tumor
cells and TILs was analyzed using a quantitative multispectral imaging system
(Opal™), with these results validated by immuno-histochemical assays for PD-L1 on
whole slide sections.
RESULTS: The proportion of tumors overexpressing PD-L1 (31.0 vs. 0%, P = 0.002), 
TIL density (4548 vs. 2631/mm2, P < 0.001), and intra-tumoral CD8+ T-cell density
(2650 vs. 1060/mm2, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in EBV+ than in EBV-
GCLS. In addition, CD8+/CD3+ T-cell ratio was higher in EBV+ than in EBV- GCLS
(55.3 vs. 35.8%, P < 0.001). Lower TIL density, defined as < 1350/mm2, was a
significant negative factor of survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite histopathological similarity, quantitative multispectral
imaging revealed differences in the tumor immune micro-environment between EBV+
and EBV- GCLS, indicating that the underlying pathogenesis differs in these two
disease entities. TIL density may be a prognostic marker in patients with GCLS.
