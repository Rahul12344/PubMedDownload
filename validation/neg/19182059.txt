In countries with generalized HIV epidemics, people may be exposed to blood-borne
HIV at their home as well as during health care and cosmetic services. We asked
young adults from the Luo and Kisii ethnic groups in Nyanza Province, Kenya, how 
long HIV survives in blood and how to clean skin-piercing instruments. Only 21%
thought that HIV could survive more than an hour in dry conditions (although it
can survive for days), and only 24% thought it could survive more than a week in 
wet conditions (although it can survive more than four weeks). The Kisii, with
lower HIV prevalence, were more knowledgeable than the Luo about HIV survival.
Survey participants reported that barbers and other service providers often
cleaned instruments by wiping with alcohol or bleach, a practice which does not
reliably inactivate HIV. People we interviewed, at risk from blood-borne HIV, did
not know enough to protect themselves.
