The role of type II restriction endonucleases in phage development in two
different strains of Streptomyces coelicolor has been analyzed. Two of ten phages
tested (phi A4 R4c 1) presented a low efficiency of plating (e.o.p.) in the
studied strains. The isolation of host-range mutants of phi A4 and R4c 1, with
improved e.o.p. and higher adsorption capability in these two bacterial strains, 
suggests that the presence of host endonucleases is not the main barrier for
these phages, but rather adsorption inability.
