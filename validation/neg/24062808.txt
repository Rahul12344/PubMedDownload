The BK virus (BKV) is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the
polyomavirus family that primarily affects immunocompromised people. BKV infects 
humans at an early age. Initial infections with BKV are mainly asymptomatic and
usually remain latent in the brain, peripheral blood, kidneys, and urothelium.
Following the primary infection, viruses persist indefinitely as 'latent'
infections of the kidney and urinary system because the virus is urotheliotropic.
Reactivation of the virus infections occurs in individuals with severe
immunosuppression states such as kidney and stem cell transplantation and rarely 
in pregnancy. In this line, BKV has been implicated as a common cause of
late-onset haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients who have undergone stem cell
transplantation. In contrast, reports of BKV-associated diseases in nontransplant
paediatric patients are almost exclusively in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus infection. Herein, we report the first case of a child
with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who developed BKV-associated HC without
receiving stem cell transplantation while on standard maintenance chemotherapy.
