Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a major worldwide public health problem.
However, the factors involved in mediating the inflammatory response to this
infection and their relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we show that
IAV infection stimulates the expression of the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), a 
multifunctional protein involved in IL-6 signaling. Interestingly, sIL-6R
expression upregulated the levels of its own ligand, IL-6 and those of the
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-32. shRNA-mediated knockdown of sIL-6R suppressed
IL-6 and IL-32, indicating that this regulation is dependent on sIL-6R during IAV
infection. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that IL-32 participates in a
negative feedback loop that inhibits sIL-6R while upregulating IL-6 expression
during IAV infection. Therefore, we show that sIL-6R is a critical cellular
factor involved in the acute inflammatory response to viral infection.
