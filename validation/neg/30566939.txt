Animals are usually regarded as independent entities within their respective
environments. However, within an organism, eukaryotes and prokaryotes interact
dynamically to form the so-called metaorganism or holobiont, where each partner
fulfils its versatile and crucial role. This review focuses on the interplay
between microorganisms and multicellular eukaryotes in the context of host
physiology, in particular aging and mucus-associated crosstalk. In addition to
the interactions between bacteria and the host, we highlight the importance of
viruses and nonmodel organisms. Moreover, we discuss current culturing and
computational methodologies that allow a deeper understanding of underlying
mechanisms controlling the physiology of metaorganisms.
