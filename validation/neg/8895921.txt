BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether a woman's risk of transmitting HIV
perinatally increases over time and whether the infection outcome of a previous
child affects the risk of transmitting HIV to subsequent children.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 114 prospectively followed women who gave birth to
at least 2 children after becoming infected with HIV to determine the risk for
perinatal HIV transmission to these sibling pairs.
RESULTS: The median interval between sibling births was 19 months. HIV infection 
occurred in 19 (17%) older siblings and 20 (18%) younger siblings (P = 0.87). Two
(11%) of the 19 children with infected older siblings were infected compared with
18 (19%) of the 95 children with uninfected older siblings (P = 0.86). The risk
for transmission to younger siblings was not associated with the interval between
deliveries of the two siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: These data do not demonstrate that an HIV-infected woman's risk of
transmitting HIV perinatally increases with time, although the observed
interpregnancy interval was relatively short. The risk for perinatal transmission
does not appear to be affected by the infection outcome of previous children.
These findings may be useful for counseling HIV-infected women about their risk
of transmitting HIV perinatally.
