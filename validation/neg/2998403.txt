[Use of an RNAse inhibitor from the human placenta in specific fragmentation of
high molecular weight RNA by ribonuclease H].

Human placenta RNase inhibitor has been shown to suppress the interfering
ribonucleases, virtually not affecting the RNase H activity. This allows the
usage of the inhibitor in the course of site-specific cleavage of high molecular 
weight RNAs by ribonuclease H.
