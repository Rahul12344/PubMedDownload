In order to search for novel bioactive substances from marine organisms, we have 
investigated the organic extracts of the Taiwanese octocoral Briareumexcavatum
collected at Orchid Island. Three new briarane-type diterpenoids, briacavatolides
A-C (1-3) as well as two known briaranes, briaexcavatolide U (4) and
briaexcavatin L (5) were isolated from the acetone extract. The structures of
these compounds were elucidated by extensive NMR spectroscopic analysis and
physical data. The anti-HCMV (human cytomegalovirus) activity of 1-5 and their
cytotoxicity against selected cancer cell lines were evaluated.
