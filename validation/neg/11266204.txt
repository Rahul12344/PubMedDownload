Very little is known about the cellular factors that are required for the
maturation of rubella virus glycoproteins (E2 and E1) in the endoplasmic
reticulum of the infected cell. In the present study, we established the
interaction of the ER chaperone proteins, calreticulin and calnexin, with the RV 
E1 and E2 proteins in cells stably expressing the viral proteins. The interaction
between E2 and calnexin was significantly higher than with calreticulin. In
pulse-chase experiments, the half-life of the E2-calnexin was >45 min, whereas
the half-life of the calreticulin-E2 interaction was approximately 10 min.
Tunicamycin and castanospermine treatments altered the mobilities of
intracellular E1 and E2, due to either lack of oligosaccharide ligand addition or
trimming of terminal glucose residues, respectively. Further, the drug treatments
resulted in a loss of E1 and E2 interaction with calreticulin or calnexin,
thereby demonstrating that the interaction is through monoglucosylated forms of
RV proteins. These studies suggest that the interaction of RV glycoproteins with 
the ER chaperone proteins is essential for their maturation in the endoplasmic
reticulum.
