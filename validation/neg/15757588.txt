Transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene expression is controlled in part by the 
interaction of viral and cellular transcription factors with the HIV-1 long
terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. LTR variability among different HIV-1 subtypes
could affect LTR binding of either cellular or viral elements, influencing the
transcription level. This effect, in turn, may have consequences on the biology
of the different HIV-1 clades and on disease progression. In some circumstances, 
a relationship between replication capacity in vitro and changes in binding
sequences for transcription factors located at the LTR has been proven.
