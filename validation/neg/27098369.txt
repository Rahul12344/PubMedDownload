Early detection of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is essential to halting
transmission and adjudicating appropriate treatment. However, current methods
rely on viral identification, and this approach can misdiagnose presymptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals. In contrast, disease-driven alterations in the host
transcriptome can be exploited for pathogen-specific diagnostic biomarkers. Here,
we present for the first time EBOV-induced changes in circulating miRNA
populations of nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans. We retrospectively profiled
longitudinally-collected plasma samples from rhesus macaques challenged via
intramuscular and aerosol routes and found 36 miRNAs differentially present in
both groups. Comparison of miRNA abundances to viral loads uncovered 15 highly
correlated miRNAs common to EBOV-infected NHPs and humans. As proof of principle,
we developed an eight-miRNA classifier that correctly categorized infection
status in 64/74 (86%) human and NHP samples. The classifier identified acute
infections in 27/29 (93.1%) samples and in 6/12 (50%) presymptomatic NHPs. These 
findings showed applicability of NHP-derived miRNAs to a human cohort, and with
additional research the resulting classifiers could impact the current capability
to diagnose presymptomatic and asymptomatic EBOV infections.
