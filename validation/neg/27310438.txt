BACKGROUND: Preterm infants are at high risk of developing respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). This
observational epidemiologic study evaluated RSV disease burden and risk factors
for RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization in preterm infants 33 weeks+0 days to 35 
weeks+6 days gestational age not receiving RSV prophylaxis.
METHODS: Preterm infants ≤6 months of age during RSV season (1 October 2013-30
April 2014) were followed at 72 sites across 23 countries from September
2013-July 2014 (study period). RSV testing was performed according to local
clinical practice. Factors related to RSV-associated hospitalization for LRTI
were identified using multivariable logistic regression with backward selection.
RESULTS: Of the 2390 evaluable infants, 204 and 127 were hospitalized for LRTI
during the study period and RSV season, respectively. Among these subjects,
64/204 and 46/127, respectively, were hospitalized for confirmed RSV LRTI. Study 
period and RSV season normalized RSV hospitalization rates (per 100 infant years)
were 4.1 and 6.1, respectively. Factors associated with an increased risk of
RSV-related LRTI hospitalization in multivariable analyses were smoking of family
members (P<0.0001), non-hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
diagnosis (P = 0.0077), maternal age of ≤25 years at delivery (P = 0.0009), low
maternal educational level (P = 0.0426), household presence of children aged 4 to
5 years (P = 0.0038), age on 1 October ≤3 months (P = 0.0422), and presence of
paternal atopy (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: During the 2013-2014 RSV season across 23 countries, for preterm
infants 33-35 weeks gestation ≤6 months old on 1 October not receiving RSV
prophylaxis, confirmed RSV LRTI hospitalization incidence was 4.1 per 100 infant 
years during the study period and 6.1 per 100 infant years during the RSV season.
This study enhances the findings of single-country studies of common risk factors
for severe RSV infection in preterm infants and suggests that combinations of 4-6
risk factors may be used to accurately predict risk of RSV hospitalization. These
findings may be useful in the identification of infants most at risk of severe
RSV infection.
