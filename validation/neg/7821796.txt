The Marek's disease virus (MDV) glycoprotein B (gB) precursor, gp100, is
proteolytically cleaved into two disulfide-linked subunits, gp60 and gp49. In the
gB homologs of most other herpesviruses, a tetrapeptide, Arg-Xaa-Arg-Arg, is
immediately upstream from the predicted cleavage site. We have investigated the
specificity of the proteolytic cleavage in gp100 by introducing mutations within 
its predicted cleavage site (Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg) and expressed these mutants in
recombinant fowlpox virus (FPV). The results show that all three Arg residues at 
the predicted cleavage site play an important role in the specific proteolytic
cleavage of gp100. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the cleavage of gp100 is not
necessary for transport of gB to the cell surface.
