Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are currently at the forefront of human gene
therapy clinical trials as recombinant vectors. Significant progress has been
made in elucidating the structure, biology and tropisms of different naturally
occurring AAV isolates in the past decade. In particular, a spectrum of AAV
capsid interactions with host receptors have been identified and characterized.
These studies have enabled a better understanding of key determinants of AAV cell
recognition and entry in different hosts. This knowledge is now being applied
toward engineering new, lab-derived AAV capsids with favorable transduction
profiles. The current review conveys a structural perspective of capsid-glycan
interactions and provides a roadmap for generating synthetic strains by
engineering AAV receptor footprints.
