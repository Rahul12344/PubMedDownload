PVC-211 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) causes neurodegenerative disease following
inoculation of neonatal, but not adult, mice and rats. It was previously shown
that tropism for brain capillary endothelial cells (CEC) was a determinant of the
viral neuropathogenicity. In this study, we demonstrate that host age-dependent
replication of PVC-211 MuLV in vivo occurs in CEC in the brain as well as in
other organs, such as the liver, kidney, and heart. In contrast, primary explant 
cultures of CEC derived from brains and livers of adult and neonatal rats could
be infected by PVC-211 MuLV, suggesting that the age-dependent susceptibility was
abrogated in vitro. Although CEC were generally less susceptible to MuLV-mediated
gene transduction than fibroblasts, treatment of CEC with 2-deoxyglucose followed
by inoculation of a PVC-211 MuLV-pseudotyped vector in the absence of heparin
improved the transduction efficiency. These observations support the possibility 
that PVC-211 MuLV may be useful for establishing models of CEC gene transduction.
