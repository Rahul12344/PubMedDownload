Pharmacological modulation of cellular proteins as a means to block virus
replication has been proposed as an alternative antiviral strategy that may be
less susceptible than others to the development of viral drug resistance. Recent 
evidence indicates that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway interacts with different
aspects of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle in cell culture models of virus
replication. We therefore examined the effect of proteasome inhibition on HBV
replication in vivo using HBV transgenic mice. The proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (Velcade) inhibits proteasome activity in vivo and is used
therapeutically for the clinical treatment of multiple myeloma. We found that a
single intravenous dose of 1 mg of bortezomib/kg of body weight reduced virus
replication for as long as 6 days. The inhibition of HBV by bortezomib was dose
dependent and occurred at a step in replication subsequent to viral RNA and
protein expression. The reduction in HBV replication did not result from
nonspecific hepatocellular toxicity and was not mediated indirectly through the
induction of an intrahepatic interferon response. Thus, pharmacological
manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may represent an alternative
therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.
