OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive factors for progression and recurrence of 
vulvovaginal condyloma (VVC), with a specific focus on high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)
infections.
METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from 48 patients who were diagnosed
with VVC and treated with topical trichloroacetic acid application or laser
therapy during 2003-2014 at a hospital in South Korea. The diagnoses were made
based on the presence of exophytic condylomatous lesions as assessed by direct
visual inspection regardless of whether a biopsy was performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 18 patients (50.0% of those with a test result) were positive
for HR-HPV. Three-quarters of the patients with a poor treatment response had
abnormal cytologies, and abnormal cytology was a risk factor for a poor response 
(odds ratio, 4.33 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-17.84]). During a median
follow-up of 24months, VVC recurred in seven (14.6%) patients. A high viral load 
(more than 50 relative light units) of HR-HPV was significantly associated with
recurrence (odds ratio, 7.42, 95% confidence interval, 1.19-46.18).
CONCLUSION: A high HR-HPV load is a risk factor for recurrence, but is not
related to treatment response. A poor treatment response is more related to
abnormal cytology than it is to viral load.
