The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse tissues from paraffin
blocks of liver needle biopsies retrospectively. Biopsies of 29 patients with
proven HBsAg and HBcAg expression in liver tissue and of 8 healthy volunteers
served as positive (group 1) and negative tissue controls (group 2),
respectively. These were compared with 16 patients with proven HBsAg expression
in liver but lack of HBcAg (group 3), with 23 patients with anti-HBc as the only 
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related marker (group 4) and with 21 patients with liver 
disease and without HBV markers in tissue or serum (group 5). PCR detected HBV
sequences in all cases of the positive control group and in 94% of group 3, in
65% of group 4, and in 71.4% of group 5, whereas all healthy volunteers were
negative. Our data show that PCR is able to detect HBV-DNA sequences in virtually
all patients with active viral antigen expression but also in a high proportion
of hepatitic patients who are silent for active HB but may or may not show signs 
of a contact with the HBV. Thus, PCR for HBV-DNA in paraffin sections might
become a useful tool for identifying patients carrying HBV-DNA but not expressing
HBV antigens.
