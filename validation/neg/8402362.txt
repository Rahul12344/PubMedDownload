Nine Chinese children (four males, five females) in whom serology showed
Epstein-Barr virus infection were studied retrospectively. They were from 1.5 to 
14 years of age. Various symptoms and signs, including disturbance of
consciousness, visual hallucination, cranial neuropathies and sphincter
dysfunction, led to initial clinical impressions of encephalitis,
encephalomyelitis and neuro-degenerative disease. Electroencephalography showed
focal spikes over the frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal areas. The
patients underwent brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging,
and three of them underwent HMPAO SPECT. Eight patients appeared normal
neurologically during follow-up, and the single patient who had spastic
quadriparesis improved gradually. Though visual hallucination is not a specific
presentation, it is a peculiar picture of Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis.
Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis seemed to be self-limiting without specific
treatment in this group.
