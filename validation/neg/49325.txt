Lymphoblastoid transformation and kinetics of appearance of viral nuclear antigen
(EBNA) in cord-blood lymphocytes infected by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV).

Yata J, Desgranges C, Nakagawa T, Favre MC, De-The G.

Human cord-blood lymphocytes were infected with B95.8 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
before and after separation into B- and T-cell populations. Lymphoblastoid cells 
exhibiting B-cell characteristics appeared after 2 to 3 days of culture in the
total population and in the separated B-cell subpopulation but not in the T-cell 
subpopulation. EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected concurrently with the
appearance of lymphoblastoid cells. The proportion of EBNA-positive cells
corresponded to that of lymphoblastoid cells, and reached 50% after 4 days. EBNA 
was present only in cells with B-cell markers. These observations indicate that
only B-cells are susceptible to EBV infection, that the transformation occurs
within a few days and that EBNA is a valid early marker for susceptibility to EBV
transformation.
