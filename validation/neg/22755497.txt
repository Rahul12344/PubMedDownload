Nowadays communication plays a key role in healthcare, especially when a detailed
risk analysis is important for correct information, as in the case of the H1N1
flu virus A. Through our study we have analyzed how the event "H1N1 flu" was
addressed by the media, considering the period April 2009-June 2010. We collected
the information from "Il Corriere della Sera", "La Repubblica" and "City", in
addition to an online site for general information such as "TGCOM". The analyzed 
peak of daily news was seen a few weeks before the pandemic peak; in addition,
after the peak of the pandemic, the interest of the press has completely
collapsed, and eventually disappeared altogether. The media can influence the
thought and consequentially how the recipients act, leading to a misperception of
risk ('risk') and danger ('hazard'). Moreover the institutions and health
professionals are not always able to communicate effectively to meet the needs
for correct information. It is desirable in the future a greater degree of
collaboration between media and authorities to have a clearer simpler and less
misleading communication in the health field, helping recipients to act properly.
