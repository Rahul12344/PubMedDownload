BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of general population studies report mean low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions of 30% to <50% with moderate-intensity
and ≥50% with high-intensity statins. Persons living with human immunodeficiency 
virus (PLWH) are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD),
yet many have elevated LDL-C.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate LDL-C response after statin initiation among PLWH.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of PLWH initiating statins
between 2009 and 2013 (N = 706). Patients were categorized into mutually
exclusive groups in the following hierarchy: history of coronary heart disease
(CHD), diabetes, prestatin LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, 10-year predicted ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, 
and none of the above (ie, unknown statin indication). The primary outcome was a 
≥30% reduction in LDL-C after statin initiation.
RESULTS: Among patients initiating statins, 5.8% had a history of CHD, 13.6% had 
diabetes, 6.2% had LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, 35.4% had 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, and
39.0% had an unknown statin indication. Among patients with a history of CHD,
31.7% achieved a ≥30% LDL-C reduction compared with 25.0%, 59.1%, and 33.9% among
those with diabetes, LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, and 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%,
respectively. In multivariable adjusted analyses and compared to patients with an
unknown statin indication, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL was associated with a prevalence
ratio for an LDL-C reduction ≥30% of 1.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.45),
whereas no statistically significant association was present for history of CHD, 
diabetes, and 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%.
CONCLUSION: A low percentage of PLWH achieved the expected reductions in LDL-C
after statin initiation, highlighting an unmet need for ASCVD risk reduction.
