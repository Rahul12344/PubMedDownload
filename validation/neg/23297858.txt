Enterocyte turnover along with proper epithelial barrier function are crucial
aspects of mucosal defense. Apoptosis is a highly regulated type of programmed
cell death that allows for the homeostatic turnover of the epithelial layer.
Recent studies have suggested that microbial modulation of enterocyte apoptosis
can result in increased epithelial permeability, leading to gastrointestinal
pathophysiology. In this review, we highlight key mechanisms and pathways via
which various viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens are able to modulate
enterocyte apoptosis. We also discuss how these alterations to enterocyte
apoptosis can result in the activation of chronic gastrointestinal disorders,
such as allergies, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). The role of proteinase-activated receptors in the pathogenesis of
modulated apoptosis-induced pathogenesis is also discussed. Newly discovered
processes, through which host epithelial cells may have evolved, rescue
mechanisms from microbe-induced apoptosis are discussed. Together, these
mechanisms are key to our ever-increasing understanding of host-microbe
interactions in the gut.
