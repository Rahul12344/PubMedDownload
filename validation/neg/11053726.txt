Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 27 patients with human
immunodificiency virus after weight loss and in 20 lean controls. Left
ventricular mass index was significantly higher and left ventricular fractional
shortening was significantly lower in patients with human immunodificiency virus 
after weight loss than in lean, normal controls.
