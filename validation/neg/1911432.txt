The mammalian ribosomal RNA gene promoters exhibit a conserved sequence between
positions +1 and +16 that shows a high degree of homology to the response element
for glucocorticoids and progestins (GRE/PRE). These sequences bind specifically
the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor (PR) albeit with lower 
affinity than a canonical GRE/PRE. Because steroid hormones are known to affect
expression of the ribosomal genes, we tested the influence of hormone receptors
on the activity of the ribosomal RNA gene promoter in a cell-free transcription
assay. Preparations of PR that induce transcription from the mouse mammary tumour
virus (MMTV) promoter do not stimulate but slightly inhibit transcription from
the ribosomal RNA gene promoter. This weak negative effect is not mediated
through binding to the hypothetical GRE/PRE as a mutant promoter that does not
bind receptor is equally repressed. Introduction of the functional MMTV GRE/PRE
upstream of the basal ribosomal RNA gene promoter does not enhance its
transcription in the presence of an active PR. Thus, RNA polymerase I
transcription cannot be stimulated in vitro by cis elements and regulatory
proteins that are active in RNA polymerase II transcription.
