Microencapsulation is a versatile method for enhancing the stability of
bacteriophages under harsh conditions, such as those which occur during thermal
processing. For food applications, encapsulation in food-grade polymer matrices
is desirable owing to their nontoxicity and low cost. Here, we describe the
encapsulation of Listeria phage A511 using sodium alginate, gum arabic, and
gelatin to maximize its viability during thermal processing.
