Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with a
growing number of complications in immunocompromised patients. Multiple reports
of HHV-6B-associated hepatitis following primary HHV-6 infection and liver
transplantation have appeared, but this has only been well documented in 1
patient after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This report describes a
case of acute hepatitis likely caused by HHV-6B in an HCT recipient who was
successfully treated with ganciclovir. HHV-6B DNA was demonstrated in plasma and 
hepatic tissue using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
immunohistochemical stains. Chromosomal integration was ruled out. We review the 
literature reporting HHV-6B-associated hepatitis, which may be an
underappreciated cause of liver disease after HCT.
