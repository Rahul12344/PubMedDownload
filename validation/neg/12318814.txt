AIDS and the workplace: signs of hope from Zimbabwe.

Williams G, Ray S.

PIP: Strategies for Hope is a series of booklets and videos about innovative and 
practical approaches to AIDS management and prevention in developing countries.
It is published by the UK development agency ACTIONAID and the African Medical
and Research Foundation with technical and financial support from the World
Health Organization Global Program on AIDS. More than 500,000 booklets and 5000
videos have been distributed worldwide. The authors describe what they learned
while researching the eighth booklet in the series, Work Against AIDS, analyzing 
seven workplace-based AIDS programs in Zimbabwe. They argue that the workplace
can play a far greater role in AIDS awareness and prevention than is generally
realized. AIDS is already affecting the health and productivity of the workforce 
in Zimbabwe, where in some areas more than 15% of adults are estimated to be
HIV-positive. Morbidity and mortality are rising with concomitant worker
absenteeism, yet most workplaces in Zimbabwe do not have even a poster about AIDS
on display. There are, however, some impressive education programs under way.
These programs, run by a significant number of volunteer peer educators, are
working to reduce the stigma attached with sexually transmitted diseases and
promote low-cost or free treatment. The authors also note as most promising the
program of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions training 700 Health and Safety
representatives at shop-floor and branch levels in AIDS-related human rights
issues at the workplace as well as AIDS awareness and prevention.
