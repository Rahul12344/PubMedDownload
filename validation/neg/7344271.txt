Immunoglobulins, haemolytic complement and serum C3 in cattle infected with
malignant catarrhal fever herpesvirus.

Mushi EZ, Rurangirwa FR.

Serum levels of the third component of complement (C3) were reduced only in the
terminal stages in malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) virus-infected steers.
Haemolytic complement and immunoglobulin (IgM, IgG1 and IgG2) levels were not
altered. C3 and immunoglobulin deposits were also not demonstrated in the
vascular lesions induced by MCFV. MCF virus infection of cattle is probably not a
typical immune complex-mediated disease as previously suggested.
