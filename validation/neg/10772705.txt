A series of 2'-deoxy analogues of the antiviral agent
5,6-dichloro-2-isopropylamino-1-(beta-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole (1263W94)
were synthesized and evaluated for activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 
and for cytotoxicity. The 2-substituents in the benzimidazole moiety correspond
to those that were used in the 1263W94 series. In general, as was found in the
1263W94 series, cyclic and branched alkylamino groups were needed for potent
activity against HCMV. Three analogues 3a, 3b and 3d were as potent as 1263W94.
Further evaluation of two analogues, 3a and 3b, suggested that these 2'-deoxy
analogues may act via a novel mechanism of action similar to that of 1263W94.
These 2'-deoxy analogues generally lacked cytotoxicity in vitro. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters in mice and protein binding properties of 3a were quite similar to
1263W94. However, the oral bioavailability of 3a was only half of that observed
for 1263W94.
