Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused significant
lethality rates in neonatal piglets, which pose a serious threat to the swine
industry worldwide. Available commercial vaccines fail to protect against the
emergence of high virulence of PEDV variants. Therefore, the endemic state of the
PEDV infection in suckling piglets highlights the urgent need for uncovering the 
molecular determinants of the disease pathogenesis. In this study, stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), combined with high-performance
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was performed to determine
proteomic differences between PEDV-infected and mock-infected Vero cells at 18 h 
postinfection. The SILAC-based approach identified 4508 host-cell proteins, of
which 120 were significantly up-regulated and 103 were significantly
down-regulated at â‰¥95% confidence. Alterations in the expression of selected
proteins were verified by Western blot. Several signaling metabolic pathways
including mevalonate pathway I and the superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis
were triggered by the infection of the highly virulent strain and are linked to
host innate immunity. 25-HC, an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, exhibited
potent antiviral activity against PEDV infection. Meanwhile, the
cell-cycle-related functions were significantly regulated, which may likely be
responsible for the viral replication and pathogenicity of PEDV.
