Deoxyspergualin (DSG) is a novel immunosuppressive agent recently shown to bind
to the constitutive heat shock protein 70, which is involved in binding and
intracellular transport of antigenic peptides. In this study, we show that DSG
inhibits the proliferation of PBMCs to the Ags tetanus toxoid and diphtheria
toxoid, but not to the mitogens PHA and PMA/ionomycin, nor to the superantigens
toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A. DSG's effect was
specific for monocytes as preincubation of T cells with DSG did not inhibit their
proliferation to monocytes pulsed with tetanus toxoid Ag for 16 h, whereas the
presence of DSG during Ag pulsing of the monocytes inhibited their ability to
stimulate T cell proliferation. DSG did not down-regulate the expression of MHC
class II molecules by monocytes, and the inhibitory effect of DSG on T cell
proliferation was not reversed by the addition of IL-2, nor by the addition of
the costimulatory signals IL-1, IL-6, and anti-CD28. Studies with two human T
cell clones, HA1.7 and PF5, specific, respectively, to peptides spanning amino
acids 307-319 and 256-270 of influenza hemagglutinin, showed that DSG inhibited
the proliferation of the clones to the native hemagglutinin molecule but
minimally affected their proliferation to the peptides. These data suggest that
DSG interferes with Ag processing and/or presentation.
