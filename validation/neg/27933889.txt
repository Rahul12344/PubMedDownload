The pharmacokinetic properties of tenofovir (TFV) and other charged nucleoside
analogues are dramatically improved upon conjugation to a lipid prodrug. We
previously prepared reduction-sensitive lipid conjugates of TFV that demonstrate 
superior antiviral activity compared to other lipid conjugates including the
clinically approved formulation, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). In
continuation of that work, we have synthesized next-generation conjugates with
reduced cytotoxicity that retain potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and HBV 
with a therapeutic index >100000 for our most potent conjugate. We also show that
disulfide reduction is not responsible for prodrug cleavage unless 3-exo-tet
intramolecular cyclization can occur, suggesting that enzymatic hydrolysis is
predominantly responsible for activity of our prodrugs in vitro.
