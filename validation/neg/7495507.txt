Over the past two years, a number of reports have described specific cellular
immune responses to HIV in some individuals who, despite exposure to the virus,
remain uninfected. A recent description of virus disappearance in a child born to
an infected mother should be seen against the background of several previous
studies that have hinted at the possibility of clearance of HIV. These findings
suggest that immune-mediated clearance of virus may occur in a few fortunate
individuals.
