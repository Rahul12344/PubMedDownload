Phage resistance of 225 strains of cholera germs of O1 group obtained from
different countries in 1988-1992 has been analyzed. Change of sensitivity to
diagnostic phages was mostly connected with the decrease or loss of
agglutinability in cholera sera. Phage resistance is rather conditioned by the
change of the surface structures of the cell and by further change of phage
reception zones. The increase in the number of strains sensitive to diagnostic
phages after 6-12 months of storage evidenced for stabilization of cell wall
structures and increase of their viability under relatively favourable conditions
of storage.
