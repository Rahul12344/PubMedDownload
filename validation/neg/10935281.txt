Adenovirus infections are ubiquitous in commercially farmed birds, and probably
in all avian species. There is a wide range of virulence, in some cases even
within the same serotype. While many infections are subclinical and appear to be 
of little economic or welfare importance, significant outbreaks of disease
associated with adenovirus do occur. These diseases are not of public health
significance.
