Observation of molecular processes inside living cells is fundamental to a deeper
understanding of virus-host interactions in filoviral-infected cells. These
observations can provide spatiotemporal insights into protein synthesis,
protein-protein interaction dynamics, and transport processes of these highly
pathogenic viruses. Thus, live-cell imaging provides the possibility for
antiviral screening in real time and gives mechanistic insights into
understanding filovirus assembly steps that are dependent on cellular factors,
which then represent potential targets against this highly fatal disease. Here we
describe analysis of living filovirus-infected cells under maximum biosafety
(i.e., BSL4) conditions using plasmid-driven expression of fluorescently labeled 
viral and cellular proteins and/or viral genome-encoded expression of
fluorescently labeled proteins. Such multiple-color and multidimensional
time-lapse live-cell imaging analyses are a powerful method to gain a better
understanding of the filovirus infection cycle.
