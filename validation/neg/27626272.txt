Our study demonstrates the repeated isolation of vaccine-derived Newcastle
disease viruses from different species of wild birds across four continents from 
1997 through 2014. The data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian
orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived Newcastle disease
viruses. The most frequently reported isolates were detected among individuals in
the order Columbiformes (n = 23), followed in frequency by the order Anseriformes
(n = 13). Samples were isolated from both free-ranging (n = 47) and wild birds
kept in captivity (n = 7). The number of recovered vaccine-derived viruses
corresponded with the most widely utilized vaccines, LaSota (n = 28) and Hitchner
B1 (n = 19). Other detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled the PHY-LMV2 and V4
vaccines, with five and two cases, respectively. These results and the ubiquitous
and synanthropic nature of wild pigeons highlight their potential role as
indicator species for the presence of Newcastle disease virus of low virulence in
the environment. The reverse spillover of live agents from domestic animals to
wildlife as a result of the expansion of livestock industries employing massive
amounts of live virus vaccines represent an underappreciated and poorly studied
effect of human activity on wildlife.
