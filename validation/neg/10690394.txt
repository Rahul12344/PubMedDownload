BACKGROUND: Most Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated lymphoproliferative
disorders have high proliferation indices. However, classical Hodgkin's disease
(cHD) is heterogeneous, with respect to proliferation index of the Reed-Sternberg
cell (RS cell), and EBV association. Hence, we investigated whether cHD with and 
without EBV-association differ with respect to the proliferation index of the RS 
cells. Further we investigated whether this would have a bearing on patients
survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 110 cases of cHD for: a) EBV association by
immunohistochemical demonstration of EBV-latent membrane protein-1 and EBV
encoded nuclear RNA 1 by mRNA in situ hybridisation; b) Proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the RS cells.
RESULTS: EBV association was noted in 86 of 110 cases (78%). Higher PCNA
expression (P = 0.004) and younger age (P = 0.001) correlated independently with 
EBV association. The 10 year relapse free survival (RFS) of EBV+ and EBV-
patients were 60% and 44%, respectively (P = 0.03). The 10 year overall survival 
(OS) of EBV+ and EBV- patients were 85% and 64%, respectively (P = 0.03). EBV
association maintained its significant impact on RFS and OS within Cox
proportional hazard model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that EBV is likely to confer a higher PCNA
expression and also contribute towards maintaining the RS cells of cHD in cell
cycle. Hence, RS cells in EBV associated cHD would be more responsive to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy associated DNA damage. Thus, EBV-association
provides survival advantage to cHD patients treated with standard chemotherapy
and radiotherapy protocols.
