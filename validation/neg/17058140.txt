We report four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (all men, with liver
cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus infections) who showed spontaneous regression of 
the tumor. When the spontaneous regression occurred all of the patients were over
age 67 years. They showed a rapid increase of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels just
before the spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma. In all the
patients, the alpha-fetoprotein level decreased to within normal limits and the
tumor was partially to completely reduced in size. One patient revealed
regression after bleeding of esophageal varices and blood transfusion. Another
showed spontaneous regression after taking several complementary and alternative 
medicines. However, the mechanisms underlying this intriguing phenomenon remain
unknown.
