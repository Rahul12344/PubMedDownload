Beta-interferon was administered by intravenous infusion to 16 patients affected 
with fulminant hepatitis B virus infection in third or fourth-grade coma. Ten
patients presented a superinfection or a co-infection due to the delta
(delta)-agent. None had detectable interferon (IFN) activity before therapy was
begun. Besides fever, no significant side-effects were observed during treatment.
Both the IFN-treated group as well as the "historical" control group, made up of 
70 cases of fulminant virus hepatitis, not treated with IFN and observed during a
previous ten year-period, received supportive therapy; survival rates were
similar in both groups. Furthermore, the presence or absence of the delta-agent
did not appear to affect survival rates significantly.
