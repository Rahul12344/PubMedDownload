In Autoimmune disease a combination of infection, genetic and environmental
factors causes an autoimmune response to the thyroid gland (characterized by
lymphocytic infiltrations), thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and
different thyroid antigens. Graves' and Hashimoto disease are autoimmune
disorders with genetic predisposition. CD40 that stimulates the proliferation and
differentiation of lymphocytes is an essential immunomodulatory component for
follicular cells in the thyroid and the cell that present the antigen. CD40,
PTPN22 and thyroid-specific genes are immunomodulating genes for the TSH receptor
and thyroglobulin. CD40 used to be associated with Graves's disease as positional
candidate on the basis of Graves' disease linkage study connecting with 20q11
genome chromosomal region. The PTPN22 gene gives rise to a substantial risk of
specific autoimmune phenotypes and frequent disease mechanisms. Infections have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of AITD including Coxsackie virus, Yersinia
enterocolitica, Borrelia burgdorferi, Helicobacter pylori and retroviruses
(HTLV-1, HFV, HIV and SV40). Infectious hepatitis C agents are the strongest
proof supporting an affiliation with AITD. The essential environmental triggers
of AITD are iodine, drugs, infection, smoking and perhaps stress. Autoimmune
disease provide important facts on genetic mechanisms that influence the
prognosis and treatment of the disease and by recent molecular techniques through
gene expression study by quantitative Real Time-PCR and microarray, we can
identify novel genes which are responsible for Graves' and Hashimoto disease.
