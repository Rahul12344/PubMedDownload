The Hepatitis B virus chronically infects the liver of 250 million people
worldwide. Over the past decades, major advances have been made in the
understanding of Hepatitis B virus life cycle in hepatocytes. Beside these
parenchymal cells, the liver also contains resident and infiltrating myeloid
cells involved in immune responses to pathogens and much less is known about
their interplay with Hepatitis B virus. In this review, we summarized and
discussed the current knowledge of the role of liver macrophages (including
Kupffer cells and liver monocyte-derived macrophages), in HBV infection. While it
is still unclear if liver macrophages play a role in the establishment and
persistence of HBV infection, several studies disclosed data suggesting that HBV 
would favour liver macrophage anti-inflammatory phenotypes and thereby increase
liver tolerance. In addition, alternatively activated liver macrophages might
also play in the long term a key role in hepatitis B-associated pathogenesis,
especially through the activation of hepatic stellate cells. Therapies aiming at 
a transient activation of pro-inflammatory liver macrophages should therefore be 
considered for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.
