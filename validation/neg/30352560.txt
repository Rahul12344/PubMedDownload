BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex encephalitis is the most common type of sporadic
encephalitis worldwide. Frank intracerebral hemorrhage complicating the disease
course in herpes simplex encephalitis patients is rare, especially cases where
surgical decompression is necessary. Here, we report a previously healthy female 
with herpes simplex encephalitis who underwent surgical decompression due to
temporal lobe hemorrhage.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 34-year-old Korean female presented with 
fever, myalgia and severe headache. Brain MRI showed a high T2 signal intensity
change and diffuse swelling of the right temporal lobe. Polymerase chain reaction
testing of the cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the presence of herpes simplex virus
1. The patient was admitted for close observation and intravenous acyclovir. On
hospital day 3, she had a sudden onset of vomiting and severe headache. Brain CT 
showed frank temporal lobe hemorrhage. Despite aggressive medical treatment, she 
became increasingly drowsy. Ultimately, she underwent emergency right
decompressive craniectomy, expansile duraplasty and intracranial pressure monitor
insertion. The patient recovered fully without any neurological deficits or
neuropsychological problems. She was discharged after completion of 2 weeks of
acyclovir and returned 2 months later for cranioplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe herpes simplex encephalitis complicated by
intracerebral hemorrhage or malignant cerebral edema should undergo aggressive
medical treatment. Surgical decompression should also be actively considered in
these severe cases to prevent further neurological deterioration.
