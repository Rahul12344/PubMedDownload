BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although off-label use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens
occurs regularly in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection undergoing
dialysis for severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), these
regimens are not licensed for this indication, and there is an absence of dosing 
recommendations in this population. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients with HCV infection with ESRD undergoing
dialysis.
METHODS: In this phase II, single-arm study, 59 patients with genotype 1-6 HCV
infection with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received
open-label sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg) once daily for 12 weeks.
Patients were HCV treatment naive or treatment experienced without cirrhosis or
with compensated cirrhosis. Patients previously treated with any HCV NS5A
inhibitor were not eligible. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of 
patients achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after
discontinuation of treatment (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was the
proportion of patients who discontinued study drug due to adverse events.
RESULTS: Overall, 56 of 59 patients achieved SVR12 (95%; 95% CI 86-99%). Of the 3
patients who did not achieve SVR12, 2 patients had virologic relapse determined
at post-treatment Week 4 (including 1 who prematurely discontinued study
treatment), and 1 patient died from suicide after achieving SVR through
post-treatment Week 4. The most common adverse events were headache (17%),
fatigue (14%), nausea (14%), and vomiting (14%). Serious adverse events were
reported for 11 patients (19%), and all were deemed to be unrelated to
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks was safe and
effective in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis.
LAY SUMMARY: Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a combination direct-acting antiviral that
is approved for treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
Despite the lack of dosing recommendations, sofosbuvir-containing regimens
(including sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) are frequently used for HCV-infected patients 
undergoing dialysis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in patients with HCV infection who were
undergoing dialysis. Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was safe and well
tolerated, resulting in a cure rate of 95% in patients with HCV infection and
end-stage renal disease. Clinical Trial Number: NCT03036852.
