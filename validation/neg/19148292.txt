We previously reported the efficacy of nonmyeloablative allogeneic
transplantation in 2 HIV positive recipients, one of whom received retrovirus
transduced hematopoietic stem cells to confer resistance to HIV. Here we report
an assessment of retroviral integration sites (RISs) recovered out to 3 years
post-transplantation. We identified 213 unique RISs from the patient's peripheral
blood samples by linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR). While vector
integration patterns were similar to that previously reported, only 3.76% of RISs
were common among early (up to 3 months) and late samples (beyond 1 year).
Additionally, common integration sites were enriched among late samples (14.9%
vs. 36.8%, respectively). Three RISs were found near or within known oncogenes,
but 2 were limited to early timepoints. Interestingly, an integration site near
the MDS1 gene was detected in long-term follow-up samples; however, the overall
contribution of MDS1 integrated clone remained stably low during follow-up.
