OBJECTIVES: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to
evaluate the impact of prophylaxis with palivizumab on mortality and morbidity
associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants at high risk (â‰¤ 
35 wks of gestational age, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease).
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents were used. MEDLINE was
searched from January 1, 1990 to May 16, 2007. The bibliographies of accepted
studies and recent reviews and proceedings from the past 2 yrs were searched to
identify additional relevant studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and prospective or retrospective
cohort studies evaluating all-cause and respiratory syncytial virus-specific
mortality, respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations, and health care use in
infants at high risk for respiratory syncytial virus infection receiving
prophylaxis with palivizumab.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data elements from each accepted study were extracted by one
researcher and confirmed by a second researcher. Differences were resolved before
data entry and analysis.
DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 2473 citations were screened and ten comparative
studies of palivizumab prophylaxis evaluating >15,000 infants were included.
Comparisons of mortality and hospitalization outcomes between infant groups using
prophylaxis and not using prophylaxis were made using meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis and nonprophylaxis infant groups appeared to be
comparable at baseline. All-cause mortality during the respiratory syncytial
virus season was 12 of 6380 (0.19%) for infants with prophylaxis vs. 33 of 8182
(0.53%) for infants without prophylaxis (Peto odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence
interval, 0.17-0.55). Only five respiratory syncytial virus-specific deaths were 
reported, and the majority of the studies did not report respiratory syncytial
virus-related deaths. The rate of respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization was
significantly lower among preterm infants with prophylaxis compared with those
without prophylaxis (4.1% vs. 10.4%; odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval,
0.25-0.47). Prophylaxis with palivizumab was associated with a reduction in
all-cause mortality and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization among preterm
infants at high risk. Additional research on cause of death among infants at high
risk is needed.
