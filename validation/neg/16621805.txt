Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor activation leads to enhanced
proliferation and cell survival via the MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-signaling pathways. Upon stimulation by IGF-I, the Hdm2 oncoprotein is
phosphorylated by AKT, leading to its rapid nuclear translocation and subsequent 
inhibition of p53. We now show that IGF-I stimulation regulates the nuclear
export of Hdm2 and p53 via the MAP kinase pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK or MEK 
via pharmacological means or expression of dominant negative proteins inhibited
the cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2 and increased Hdm2 and p53 protein levels,
whereas constitutively active p90Rsk promoted the nuclear export of Hdm2.
Expression of constitutively active p90Rsk with E1A, oncogenic H-Ras, and hTERT
resulted in the anchorage-independent growth of normal human fibroblasts. Our
findings link p90Rsk-mediated modulation of Hdm2 nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling
with the diminished ability of p53 to regulate cell cycle checkpoints that
ultimately leads to transformation.
