Immunodepression by Rowson-Parr virus in mice; lymphocyte markers and capping
response of spleen and lymph node cells after infection.

Bendinelli M, Friedman H.

Infection with Rowson-Parr virus (RPV) induced a rapid reduction in the number of
immunoglobulin-positive and theta antigen-positive cells detectable by
immunofluorescence in the spleens of susceptible BALB/c mice. The changes
produced by RPV infection in the lymph nodes were different, since the number of 
immunoglobulin-positive cells was increased and the proportion of theta-positive 
cells remained unchanged. However, the ability of immunoglobulin-bearing cells to
redistribute their receptors into caps was reduced in both types of lymphoid
tissue. A similar pattern of changes was produced by infection with Friend
leukemia complex, from which RPV was originally obtained. These effects of RPV
and Friend leukemia complex may contribute to the immunodepressed state of
infected mice.
