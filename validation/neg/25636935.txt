In this single-centre, retrospective study, we analyzed data of 194 patients
receiving antiretroviral therapy with <50 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA 
copies/mL in plasma and 318 HIV RNA/DNA paired samples. By kinetic polymerase
chain reaction (kPCR) molecular system analysis, 104 (54%) subjects had
undetectable HIV RNA and 90 (46%) had residual viraemia. Median (interquartile
range) HIV DNA load was 780 (380-1930) copies/10(6) peripheral blood lymphocytes 
(PBL), and HIV DNA loads were independently associated with residual viraemia
(p 0.002). Virological rebound occurred in 29/194 (15%) patients over a median
(interquartile range) follow-up of 17.5 (13.5-31.5) months. Residual viraemia (p 
0.002), but not HIV DNA load, was independently associated with virological
rebound.
