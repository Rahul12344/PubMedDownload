Therapeutic strategies controlling human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection are
limited due to adverse side effects and emergence of antiviral resistance
variants. A compound being evaluated for treating hCMV disease is maribavir (MBV)
which disrupts replication by inhibiting the viral kinase pUL97. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MBV is sensitive to the
proliferation state of the infected cell. In these studies, we were interested in
determining whether inhibition of the pro-proliferative transcription factor,
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), could influence the
antiviral activity of MBV. The addition of the STAT3 inhibitor, S3i-201, during
infection altered hCMV-mediated changes in cell cycle protein expression. Upon
combining S3i-201 with MBV, our data suggest that STAT3 inhibition is acting
synergistically with MBV to inhibit infection in vitro. Furthermore, specific
concentrations of S3i-201 and MBV induced caspase-dependent death of infected but
not uninfected cell. Our studies suggest that treating infection with both
S3i-201 and MBV is a novel approach to inhibit hCMV replication.
