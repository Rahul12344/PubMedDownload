Lansing poliovirus infection in mice: antibody demonstrable by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoprecipitation but not by neutralization.

Jubelt B, Lipton H.

Adult mice infected intracerebrally (i.c) with the Lansing strain of type 2 human
poliovirus (HPV2) failed to develop a systemic neutralizing antibody response
until 2 months post-infection (p.i). In contrast, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) demonstrated an antibody response of IgM and IgG classes beginning 
at day 1 p.i. with peak levels reached by 5 weeks p.i. This response was slightly
greater in paralyzed than in nonparalyzed animals. Immunoprecipitation of
poliovirus proteins from cytoplasmic extracts and disrupted purified virion
preparations revealed antibodies to three capsid proteins, two capsid precursor
proteins, and one nonstructural protein. Finally, neither neutralizing antibody
nor definite virus replication was detected after oral, intraperitoneal, or
intravenous routes of inoculation. We conclude that the lack of a systemic
neutralizing antibody response in mice is probably due to an insufficient amount 
of infectious virus and consequently viral neutralizing epitopes reaching
extraneural lymphoid tissues.
