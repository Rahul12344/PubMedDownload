The mean herpes zoster incidence in Japan was 4.15/1,000 person-years and was
5.23-7.84/1,000 person-years among those 50 years old and older. One in three
persons experiences herpes zoster before age 80, indicating how common it is. The
Oka varicella vaccine was developed to prevent varicella in healthy and
immunocompromized children and is now used to prevent varicella in 20 million
people worldwide. Contact with varicella patients and Oka varicella vaccine are
reported to augment varicella-zoster virus immunity in adults and the elderly.
Oxman et al. have shown that Oka varicella vaccine prevents herpes zoster and
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in the elderly. Oka varicella vaccine is approved to
prevent herpes zoster and PHN in the elderly in USA and Europe. We review the
relationship between varicella/Oka varicella vaccine and herpes zoster, the study
by Oxman et al., and the need to introduce this new application of Oka varicella 
vaccine in Japan.
