Currently, two types of direct methods to characterize and identify single
virions are available: electron microscopy (EM) and scanning probe techniques,
especially atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM in particular provides morphologic 
information even of the ultrastructure of viral specimens without the need to
cultivate the virus and to invasively alter the sample prior to the measurements.
Thus, AFM can play a critical role as a frontline method in diagnostic virology. 
Interestingly, varying morphological parameters for virions of the same type can 
be found in the literature, depending on whether AFM or EM was employed and
according to the respective experimental conditions during the AFM measurements. 
Here, an inter-methodological proof of principle is presented, in which the same 
single virions of herpes simplex virus 1 were probed by AFM previously and after 
they were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sophisticated
chemometric analyses then allowed a calculation of morphological parameters of
the ensemble of single virions and a comparison thereof. A distinct decrease in
the virions' dimensions was found during as well as after the SEM analyses and
could be attributed to the sample preparation for the SEM measurements. Graphical
abstract The herpes simplex virus is investigated with scanning electron and
atomic force microscopy in view of varying dimensions.
