BACKGROUND: The introduction of HIV-1 protease inhibitors into the treatment of
patients infected with HIV-1 has had a major influence on clinical practice.
However, the use of protease inhibitors is frequently associated with the
development of resistance and several side effects and interactions with other
drugs have been reported.
OBSERVATIONS: We present the first pediatric patient with paronychia with
pyogenic granuloma associated with the administration of the protease inhibitor
indinavir. Clinical findings are discussed in view of a possible interference of 
indinavir with endogenous retinoid metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Considerable evidence advocates the mediation of indinavir side
effects by impaired oxidative metabolism of retinoic acid through the inhibition 
of cytochromes P450 3A by indinavir rather than by impaired formation of
9-cis-retinoic acid.
