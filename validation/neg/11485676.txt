Yellow fever (YF) is frequently associated with high severity and death rates in 
the Amazon region of Brazil. During the rainy seasons of 1998 and 1999, 23 (eight
deaths) and 34 (eight deaths) human cases of YF were reported, respectively, in
different geographic areas of Pará State; most cases were on Marajó Island.
Patients were 1 to 46 years of age. Epidemiologic and ecological studies were
conducted in Afuá and Breves on Marajó Island; captured insects yielded isolates 
of 4 and 11 YF strains, respectively, from Haemagogus janthinomys pooled
mosquitoes. The cases on Marajó Island in 1999 resulted from lack of vaccination 
near the focus of the disease and intense migration, which brought many nonimmune
people to areas where infected vectors were present. We hypothesize that YF virus
remains in an area after an outbreak by vertical transmission among Haemagogus
mosquitoes.
