H7N7 avian influenza viruses have been widely detected in wild birds and domestic
poultry since they were first detected in chickens in Italy in 1902. They can
occasionally transmit to humans. Here, we isolated six H7N7 viruses in live
poultry markets during routine surveillance from 2010 to 2013. Sequences analysis
revealed that these viruses are reassortants bearing genes of H3N8, H7N3, H7N7,
and H10N7 influenza viruses detected in wild birds and ducks, and can be
categorized into three genotypes (A, B, and C). All six viruses bound to both
human-type and avian-type receptors. The viruses in genotype B and C could
replicate efficiently in the lungs and nasal turbinates of mice without prior
adaptation, and the genotype C virus also replicated in the brain of two of three
mice tested. It is important to continue to monitor the evolution of H7N7 viruses
and to evaluate their potential to cause human infections.
