An ultrastructural study of heterokaryons derived from Theileria parva-infected
bovine lymphoblasts and Ehrlich ascites tumour cells.

Smith K, Irvin AD, Stagg DA.

An ultrastructural study was made of Sendai virus induced heterokaryons derived
from Theileria parva-infected lymphoblasts and Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. When
fusion occurred, parasites were successfully integrated into the cytoplasm of the
resulting heterokaryons where they appeared as morphologically normal
macroschizonts. Homokaryon formation was also noted. This occurred frequently
between Ehrlich ascites tumour cells and rarely with lymphoblasts. A small
proportion of heterokaryons contained altered forms of T parva showing nuclear
components, vesicular structures and paired organelles similar to the
microshizont stage of the parasite.
