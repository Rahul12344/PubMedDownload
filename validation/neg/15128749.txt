Chemokines are a family of cytokines that induce directed migration of various
types of leukocytes through specific interactions with a group of seven
transmembrane receptors. Scavenger receptors are a heterogenous family of
transmembrane molecules that commonly bind and uptake oxidized low density
lipoprotein and bacteria. Here, we show that not only CXC chemokine 16
(CXCL16)/SR-PSOX, a transmembrane chemokine with scavenger receptor activity, but
also 12 out of 15 chemokines examined efficiently bound scavenger receptor
ligands in competition with cells expressing their specific chemokine receptors. 
Furthermore both the chemotactic and scavenger receptor activities of
SR-PSOX/CXCL16 were similarly impaired in a series of mutants altered in the
chemokine domain, indicating that SR-PSOX/CXCL16 binds scavenger receptor ligands
as well as CXCR6 using highly overlapping binding motifs. Taken together,
chemokines generally have scavenger receptor-like activity through their
receptor-binding domain, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between
chemokines and scavenger receptors.
