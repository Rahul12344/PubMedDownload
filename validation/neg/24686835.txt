Kindlins are essential coactivators, with talin, of the cell surface
receptors integrins and also participate in integrin outside-in signalling, and
the control of gene transcription in the cell nucleus. The kindlins are ~75 kDa
multidomain proteins and bind to an NPxY motif and upstream T/S cluster of the
integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tail. The hematopoietically-important kindlin
isoform, kindlin-3, is critical for platelet aggregation during thrombus
formation, leukocyte rolling in response to infection and inflammation and
osteoclast podocyte formation in bone resorption. Kindlin-3's role in these
processes has resulted in extensive cellular and physiological studies. However, 
there is a need for an efficient method of acquiring high quality milligram
quantities of the protein for further studies. We have developed a protocol, here
described, for the efficient expression and purification of recombinant murine
kindlin-3 by use of a baculovirus-driven expression system in Sf9 cells yielding 
sufficient amounts of high purity full-length protein to allow its biophysical
characterization. The same approach could be taken in the study of the other
mammalian kindlin isoforms.
