Samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) were serially obtained from 30
patients with herpes zoster (HZ) and 10 patients with chickenpox (CP). Cells were
assayed for NK-cell function and for the expression of surface membrane antigens 
which identify T-cell and NK-cell subsets. During the acute phase of disease
(less than 7 days from onset), PBMC from patients with HZ had low proportions of 
T-helper (CD 4+) cells and a large number of T-suppressor (CD 8+) cells,
resulting in a low T-helper/T-suppressor ratio. There was an increased percentage
of nonspecific suppressor cells (GD 8+-CD 11+ cells) and increased expression of 
HLA-DR determinants on both CD 8+ and CD 4+ cells. The NK activity was depressed 
with no concomitant decrease in NK cells (CD 16+ or Leu 7+ cells). In the early
convalescing phase of disease (8-14 days), there was a significant increase in CD
16+ cells and increased expression of HLA-DR on these cells, correlating with
increased NK activity. In the late recovery phase (greater than 14 days), NK
activity and levels of T-cell subpopulations were normal with the exception of
increased CD 4+ cells and, consequently, of the helper/suppressor ratios. In the 
acute phase of CP (less than 7 days), the T-cell imbalances were similar to those
encountered with HZ patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
