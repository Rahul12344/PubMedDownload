Despite the global oceanic distribution and recognised biogeochemical impact of
coccolithoviruses (EhV), their diversity remains poorly understood. Here we
employed a metagenomic approach to study the occurrence and progression of
natural EhV community genomic variability. Analysis of EhV metagenomes from the
early and late stages of an induced bloom led to three main discoveries. First,
we observed resilient and specific genomic signatures in the EhV community
associated with the Norwegian coast, which reinforce the existence of limitations
to the capacity of dispersal and genomic exchange among EhV populations. Second, 
we identified a hyper-variable region (approximately 21kbp long) in the
coccolithovirus genome. Third, we observed a clear trend for EhV relative
amino-acid diversity to reduce from early to late stages of the bloom. This study
validated two new methodological combinations, and proved very useful in the
discovery of new genomic features associated with coccolithovirus natural
communities.
