Comparative nucleotide sequence studies of a 2.4-kb cDNA fragment (nt -49 to
2361) of Korean-type hepatitis C virus (HCV) were carried out. The nt sequences
of the Korean HCV isolates have stronger sequence homologies with type II HCV
(Japanese HCV-BK) than with types I (HCV-1) or III (HCV-6). In addition, the net 
sequences of a part of the core region of ten different samples confirmed that
prevalent HCV in Korea belongs to type II with the exception of one sample which 
belongs to type III. The nt sequence of a cDNA fragment of E2/NS1 region of HCV, 
from six different serum samples, which comprises the hypervariable regions-1
(HVR-1) and -2 (HVR-2), revealed sequence heterogeneity with type II HCV (75.4 to
80.7% nt homology and 75.5 to 79.7% amino acid homology). However, it was
relatively well conserved among the Korean isolates, in fact, aa sequences of
HVR-2 as well as HVR-1, converged into two groups. Also we found consensus
sequences (T.V.G..AGRTT.G..SLE......K) in HVR-1. Thus, we propose that the
conserved patterns in HVR-1 and -2 are characteristics of the six different
Korean isolates.
