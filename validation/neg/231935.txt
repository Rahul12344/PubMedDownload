Viral heat resistance and infectious ribonucleic acid.

Larkin EP, Fassolitis AC.

High-titer suspensions of poliovirus 1 and coxsackievirus B-2 were shown to
contain a heat-resistant fraction when heated for 65 min at temperature ranging
from 56 to 70 degrees C. The addition of ribonuclease to the heated suspensions
eliminated plaque production in the cell cultures, indicating that the resistant 
fraction was infectious ribonucleic acid that had been liberated from ruptured
viruses during the heating process.
