BACKGROUND: The immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
been well characterized in vitro. However, the role of MSCs in organ
transplantation remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the
role of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxgenase (IDO)-transfected MSCs in immunoregulation
both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT) MSCs, empty lentivirus-transfected MSCs (Lenti-MSCs) or
IDO-lentivirus-transfected MSCs (IDO-MSCs) were cocultured with peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or CD4CD25 regulatory T (Treg) cells to examine the
impact of IDO on the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs in vitro. WT-MSCs,
Lenti-MSCs or IDO-MSCs (2 × 10/kg) were intravenously injected into rabbit renal 
transplant recipients immediately after surgery to examine the role of IDO-MSCs
in tolerance induction in vivo.
RESULTS: Lentivirus infection of MSCs resulted in stable expression of IDO. The
IDO-MSCs inhibited the proliferation of CD4CD25 effector T cells to a greater
extent than WT-MSCs. Coculture of PBMCs and IDO-MSCs induced a higher percentage 
of CD4CD25Foxp3 Treg cells in PBMCs. Additionally, the antigen-specific
suppressive function of these CD4CD25 Treg cells was increased. The
IDO-MSCs-treated Treg cells showed upregulated expression of cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and increased secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β. Low
doses of IDO-MSCs prolonged graft survival and induced tolerance by inducing
antigen-specific CD4CD25 Treg cells, as evidenced by the finding that
IDO-MSCs-treated kidney transplant recipients accepted donor-specific skin grafts
but rejected third-party grafts.
CONCLUSIONS: The IDO increased the direct immunoregulatory properties of MSCs.
The IDO-MSCs enhanced the expression and function of CD4CD25 Foxp3 Treg cells and
induced allograft tolerance.
