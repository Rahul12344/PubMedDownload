Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a life-threatening disease in several
carnivores including domestic dogs. Recently, we identified a molecule, CD9, a
member of the tetraspan transmembrane protein family, which facilitates, and
antibodies to which inhibit, the infection of tissue culture cells with CDV
(strain Onderstepoort). Here we describe that an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody
(MAb K41) did not interfere with binding of CDV to cells and uptake of virus. In 
addition, in single-step growth experiments, MAb K41 did not induce differences
in the levels of viral mRNA and proteins. However, the virus release of
syncytium-forming strains of CDV, the virus-induced cell-cell fusion in lytically
infected cultures, and the cell-cell fusion of uninfected with persistently
CDV-infected HeLa cells were strongly inhibited by MAb K41. These data indicate
that anti-CD9 antibodies selectively block virus-induced cell-cell fusion,
whereas virus-cell fusion is not affected.
