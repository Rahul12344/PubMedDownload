Plasmid-encoded addiction genes augment the apparent stability of various low
copy number bacterial plasmids by selectively killing plasmid-free (cured)
segregants or their progeny. The addiction module of plasmid prophage P1 consists
of a pair of genes called phd and doc. Phd serves to prevent host death when the 
prophage is retained and, should retention mechanisms fail, Doc causes death on
curing. Doc acts as a cell toxin to which Phd is an antidote. In this study we
show that host mutants with defects in either subunit of the ClpXP protease
survive the loss of a plasmid that contains a P1 addiction module. The small
antidote protein Phd is fully stable in these two mutant hosts, whereas it is
labile in a wild-type host. We conclude that the role of ClpXP in the addiction
mechanism of P1 is to degrade the Phd protein. This conclusion situates P1 among 
plasmids that elicit severe withdrawal symptoms and are able to do so because
they encode both a cell toxin and an actively degraded macromolecule that blocks 
the synthesis or function of the toxin.
