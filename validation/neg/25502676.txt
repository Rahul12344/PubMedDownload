The complete genome sequence of the San Miguel sea lion virus-8 (SMSV-8) was
determined in this study. A comparison of this sequence to other calicivirus
sequences in GenBank showed that this virus is genetically distinct from the
vesicular exanthema of swine virus/San Miguel sea lion virus (VESV/SMSV) strains 
and belongs to a novel clade within the Vesivirus genus.
