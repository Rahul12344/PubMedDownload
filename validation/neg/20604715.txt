OBJECTIVE: Extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) is a key regulator of
pathologic mineralization in articular cartilage. Articular chondrocytes generate
ePPi by the transportation of intracellular PPi (iPPi) through transport
mechanisms such as ANK or by the degradation of extracellular adenosine
triphosphate (eATP) by ectoenzymes. Although numerous modulators of ePPi have
been characterized, little is known about eATP elaboration in cartilage. We
sought to determine (1) whether eATP is coordinately regulated with ePPi and (2) 
whether ANK transports ATP.
METHODS: Primary articular chondrocytes were treated with factors known to
modulate ePPi levels including growth factors (TGFβ1 and IGF-1), anion channel
inhibitors, and chemicals that alter adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase C
activities. Additional chondrocyte monolayers were infected with adenovirus
containing functional (Ad-ANK) or mutated (Ad-ANK mutant) ANK sequences. eATP
levels were measured with a bioluminescent assay.
RESULTS: TGFβ1 enhanced eATP accumulation by 33%, whereas IGF-1 decreased eATP
accumulation by 63% and attenuated TGFβ1-induced eATP release by 72%. Forskolin
and probenecid diminished eATP accumulation by 55% and 89%.
Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate increased eATP by 29%. Transfection of
chondrocytes with Ad-ANK caused a 10-fold increase in eATP compared with control 
values.
CONCLUSION: Modulation of eATP by various factors paralleled their effects on
ePPi production, suggesting a shared pathway of ePPi and eATP production and
implicating ANK in eATP transport. As eATP directly contributes to pathologic
mineralization in articular cartilage, understanding eATP regulation may lead to 
effective therapies for crystal-associated arthritis.
