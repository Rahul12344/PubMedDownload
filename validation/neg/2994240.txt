High spontaneous mutation frequency of BPV shuttle vector.

Ashman CR, Davidson RL.

A recombinant shuttle vector containing the entire bovine papillomavirus (BPV)
genome, sequences from pBR322, and the Escherichia coli gpt gene was used to
transform mouse C127 cells. Plasmid extracted from the transformed mouse cells
was used to transform a Gpt- derivative of E. coli HB101, and the relative
frequency of plasmids carrying a mutation in the gpt gene was determined.
Approximate mutant frequencies of 3-16 X 10(-3) were observed for plasmid
molecules which had been passaged through the mammalian cells. Restriction digest
analysis indicated that most of the mutant plasmid molecules had gross
rearrangements in their DNA structures.
