Treatment of cultured BHK cells with merocyanine 540 caused the non-lytic release
of vesicular material having the phospholipid composition characteristic of
plasma membrane. The protein composition of the vesicles closely resembled that
of the soluble fraction of the cell, as expected for exovesicles budding from the
cell surface. Vesicles prepared from cells surface-iodinated with 125I contained 
no obvious iodinated membrane polypeptides, suggesting that no major proteins in 
the plasma membrane of the BHK cell are free to diffuse with lipids. The
procedure described should represent a general method, applicable to a wide range
of cell types, for isolating plasma membrane vesicles.
