In view of a persistent threat to mankind, the development of nucleotide-based
prodrugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered as a constant effort in
many medicinal chemistry groups. In an attempt to identify novel nucleoside
phosphoramidate analogues for improving the anti-HCV activity, we have explored, 
for the first time, aspartic acid (Asp) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) esters as
amidate counterparts by considering three 2'-C-methyl containing nucleosides,
2'-C-Me-cytidine, 2'-C-Me-uridine and 2'-C-Me-2'-fluoro-uridine. Synthesis of
these analogues required protection for the vicinal diol functionality of the
sugar moiety and the amino group of the cytidine nucleoside to regioselectively
perform phosphorylation reaction at the 5'-hydroxyl group. Anti-HCV data
demonstrate that the Asp-based phosphoramidates are âˆ¼550 fold more potent than
the parent nucleosides. The inhibitory activity of the Asp-ProTides was higher
than the Ala-ProTides, suggesting that Asp would be a potential amino acid
candidate to be considered for developing novel antiviral prodrugs.
