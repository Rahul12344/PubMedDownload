Begomoviruses are one of the major groups of plant viruses with an important
economic impact on crop production in tropical and subtropical regions. The
global spread of its polyphagous vector, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, has
contributed to the emergence and diversification of species within this genus. In
this study, we found a putative novel begomovirus infecting tomato plants in
Venezuela without a cognate DNA-B component. This begomovirus was genetically
characterized and compared with related species. Furthermore, its infectivity was
demonstrated by agroinoculation of infectious clones in tomato (Solanum
lycopersicum) and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The name Tomato twisted leaf
virus (ToTLV) is proposed. ToTLV showed the typical genome organization of the
DNA-A component of New World bipartite begomoviruses. However, the single DNA
component of ToTLV was able to develop systemic infection in tomato and N.
benthamiana plants, suggesting a monopartite nature of its genome. Interestingly,
an additional open reading frame ORF was observed in ToTLV encompassing the
intergenic region and the coat protein gene, which is not present in other
closely related begomoviruses. A putative transcript from this region was
amplified by strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR. Along with recent
studies, our results showed that the diversity of monopartite begomoviruses from 
the New World is greater than previously thought.
