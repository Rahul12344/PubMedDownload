A group of 58 heterosexual female partners (FP) of human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive hemophiliacs was studied by conventional diagnostic
methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot
analysis to examine whether any had acquired HIV-1 infection through sexual
transmission. A subset of 29 FP were asked to answer a detailed questionnaire
concerning their health, use of "safer sex" techniques, and other risk factors
for HIV-1 infection. They also had additional blood drawn for CD4 cell analysis, 
viral cultures, nef, gag, and env immunoblots, and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis to assess the occurrence of "silent" HIV-1 infection in a
high-risk seronegative population. Among the 58 FP, three were found to be
HIV-1-seropositive on first testing, with no new seroconversions occurring with
subsequent testing in the remaining 55. Two seropositive FP had the additional
testing and were found to have positive viral cultures, as well as positive PCR
results. All of the seronegative FP (n = 24) who had additional testing were
negative in viral culture, had negative immunoblots, and had no HIV-1 nucleic
acid sequences detected by PCR. Thus, in this population, silent HIV-1 infection 
appears to be a rare occurrence and antibody testing seems to correlate with the 
more sensitive techniques of PCR and viral cultures.
