Many viral epitope specific T cell receptors (TCRs) in MHC-matched individuals
have been demonstrated to involve conserved amino acid motifs in beta chain
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). However, it is not sure whether the 
conserved motifs can also be found in TCR beta chain. In previous studies, we
developed a modified method to enlarge the percentage of cytomegalovirus (CMV)
pp65 peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells in PBMC by continuous peptide stimulation in
vitro, which provides sufficient number of specific T cells for detection. In
this study, we further analyzed the restrictive usage of TCR V alpha and V beta
gene families and investigated the CDR3 gene sequence of pp65 peptide-specific
CD8(+) T cells. Analysis of CDR3 spectratypes suggested a restricted usage of TCR
alpha chain AV8, AV12, AV21, AV31 families and TCR beta chain BV3, BV14, BV21,
BV23, BV11 families in donor CD8(+) T cells stimulated by pp65 peptide. The
sequences of these T cells involved similar sequence (TX) G (X) A in CDR3 region 
of TCR alpha chain and L (XT) G (X) A in TCR beta chain.
