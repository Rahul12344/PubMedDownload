BACKGROUND: We have explored a gene-therapeutic approach to stimulate antitumor
immunity by adenoviral-mediated transfer of CD40 ligand (CD40L) to treat
metastatic liver cancer in a rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat metastatic liver cancer cells were implanted into the 
back of rats bilaterally. When the larger tumor reached 8.0 mm in diameter,
adenovirus vector-expressing mouse CD40L was injected intratumorally as treatment
group (n=5), while LacZ was injected in the control group (n=5).
RESULTS: In the control group, the tumor gradually grew to be 20.7+/-1.6
(mean+/-SD) mm in intratumorally injected tumors and 21.8+/-3.7 mm in opposite
tumors seven weeks after injection, respectively. In contrast, in the treatment
group, the tumor was reduced to 3.6+/-8.2 mm and 3.7+/-8.2 mm. The tumor growth
and survival rate were significantly different (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Adenovirus vector-mediated CD40L gene therapy is an effective
therapeutic method for metastatic liver cancer.
