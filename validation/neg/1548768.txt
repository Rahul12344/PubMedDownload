Adenovirus virus-associated (VA) RNAI maintains efficient protein synthesis
during the late phase of infection by preventing the activation of the
double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, DAI. A secondary structure model
for VA RNAI predicts the existence of two stems joined by a complex stem-loop
structure, the central domain. The structural consequences of mutations and
compensating mutations introduced into the apical stem lend support to this
model. In transient expression assays for VA RNA function, foreign sequences
inserted into the apical stem were fully tolerated provided that the stem
remained intact. Mutants in which the base of the apical stem was disrupted
retained partial activity, but truncation of the apical stem abolished the
ability of the RNA to block DAI activation in vitro, suggesting that the length
and position of the stem are both important for VA RNA function. These results
imply that VA RNAI activity depends on secondary structure at the top of the
apical stem as well as in the central domain and are consistent with a two-step
mechanism involving DAI interactions with both the apical stem and the central
domain.
