Ultrastructural organization of thrombocytes in normal monkeys (Macaca arctoides)
and in those with experimental viral malignant lymphoma.

Chuvirov GN, Fomenko VN.

Data on platelet ultrastructure of 6 M. arctoides monkeys investigated before and
during experimental viral malignant lymphoma are presented. It has been
established that the inner structure of thrombocytes in healthy monkeys was
almost similar to that of man. In experimental malignant lymphoma, irrespective
of the clinical period of the disease, a decrease of alpha-, beta- and
sigma-granules, a decrease of the functional activity of thrombocytes and an
increase of delta-granules and glycogen granulation content were observed. The
above mentioned disturbances can be a result of changes of megakaryocytes in
malignant lymphoma. No viral particles in thrombocytes of neither healthy nor
sick monkeys have been revealed.
