PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Interferons are natural glycoproteins that have antiviral,
antiproliferative and immune regulatory functions. They are not only involved in 
the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune conditions but are also useful in the
treatment of some rheumatologic disorders, notably Behçet's syndrome.
RECENT FINDINGS: Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) has been recommended for severe eye 
involvement in Behçet's syndrome, especially when there is a significant drop in 
visual acuity and/or retinal involvement. It can induce a high rate of complete
remission that may also persist after its discontinuation. When given early at
the beginning, interferon might be effective in ameliorating the attacks of
familial Mediterranean fever resistant to colchicine treatment. The combination
of PEGylated IFNalpha with ribavirin and rituximab emerges as a novel and
promising treatment providing complete clinical response and viral clearance in
hepatitis C virus-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia. Limited data also suggest
that interferon may induce remissions in Churg-Strauss patients who fail to
respond to conventional immunosuppressive treatment.
SUMMARY: Among several rheumatologic diseases, IFNalpha has found more widespread
use in Behçet's syndrome and hepatitis C virus-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia 
despite a paucity of formal studies. Patients should be carefully monitored for
the frequent and dose-dependent adverse effects.
