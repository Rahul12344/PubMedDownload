Inhibition by interferon of Sendai virus cytolysis.

Sato T, Tomita Y, Kuwata T.

Treatment of HeLa cells with human interferons inhibited 51Cr release from cells 
induced by ultraviolet-inactivated Sendai virus. The inhibitory effect became
apparent about 6 h after interferon treatment and persisted for 24 to 48 h. In
the interferon-treated cells, the cytolysis was inhibited within 10 min after
adding virus and the inhibitory action was suppressed by the treatment of the
cells with cycloheximide. Mock interferon and mouse interferon did not inhibit
the cytolysis and antiinterferon serum neutralized the effect of interferon. All 
these findings indicate that Sendai virus-induced cytolysis is inhibited by
interferon per se. However, interferon did not have any influence on Sendai virus
hemolysis.
