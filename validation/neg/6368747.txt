A cloning strategy for the bacteriophage T4 vs gene.

Olson NJ, Marchin GL.

The product of the bacteriophage T4 vs gene, the tau peptide, has been shown to
thermally stabilize temperature-sensitive valyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9). To 
clone the bacteriophage T4 vs gene, recombinant pBR322-T4 DNA molecules were used
to transform Escherichia coli CP 790302 (valSts). Transformants that grew at 43.5
degrees C on selective medium exhibited some properties indicative of a
phage-modified valyl-tRNA synthetase. The data are consistent with successful
cloning of the vs gene and atypical modification of the valyl-tRNA synthetase in 
CP 790302.
