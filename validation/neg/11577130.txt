A 5 month old girl had typical clinical features of acute myocarditis just after 
the febrile period of exanthem subitum and died immediately. She had been
healthy, with normal development, and there was no family history of particular
note. Myocardial postmortem findings were compatible with acute myocarditis.
Although the isolation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was not attempted, positive
IgM antibody to HHV-6 was detected in the patient's serum. Moreover, HHV-6
variant B DNA was detected in several tissues, including myocardium, by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In contrast, antibody responses to human
herpesvirus 7, another causal agent of exanthem subitum, were not found, and
enteroviral RNA was not detected in myocardial tissues by reverse transcription
PCR. Apoptotic changes were seen in infiltrating cells within the myocardial
tissues by means of the TUNEL method. HHV-6 antigen was not detected in several
tissues (including myocardium) by immunohistochemical analysis. In conclusion,
HHV-6 may have been the causative agent of fatal acute myocarditis in this
infant.
