We devised a simple procedure for titration of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA
in throat swabs from varicella patients. DNA which was extracted from throat
swabs, together with known copy numbers of a cloned VZV DNA fragment, were
10-fold serially diluted and used as template in PCR. The PCR products, after
heat denaturation, again serially diluted in 1.5 M NaCl and adsorbed to
microplate wells. Then, biotin-labeled DNA probes were hybridized with the
immobilized DNA. The hybridization signal was produced by streptavidin-conjugated
beta-galactosidase and a fluorogenic enzyme substrate. By comparing the titration
curves of a clinical specimen with those of the cloned fragment, of which
detection limit was about 10 copies, we estimated the copy numbers of VZV DNA in 
the specimen. With this technique, we evaluated the degree of potential
contagiousness of the patient along the course of infection: we found that
varicella patients possessed highest quantity of VZV DNA in the throat on the
first day of illness.
