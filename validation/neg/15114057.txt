CD8(+) T lymphocytes have the potential ability to inhibit human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) replication, by secreting soluble(s) factor(s) known as CD8(+) T
lymphocyte antiviral factor (CAF). A panel of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell clones
from HIV1-infected and uninfected donors were generated to better define the
phenotype of CAF-producing cells. We first verified that the different CD4(+) T
cell subsets (Th0, Th1, and Th2) were productively infected by X4 and R5 virus
strains. X4 viral replication in CD4(+) T cells was controlled by the three
CD8(+) T cell subsets (Tc0, Tc1, and Tc2); however, the frequency of Tc clones
controlling R5 strain was much lower with a dramatic absence of this activity
among Tc clones from uninfected donor. Finally, capacity to control viral
replication showed an heterogeneity: some clones could control both virus
strains, some controlled only the X4 virus, whereas the majority exerted no
suppressive activity.
