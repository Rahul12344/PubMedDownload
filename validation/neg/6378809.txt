Combined effects of chemotherapy and host antitumor response in a murine
histocompatible lymphoma model.

Combined effects of 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and host
antitumor immune response were studied in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with 
histocompatible LSTRA leukemia cells carrying virus-induced transplantation
antigens. Marked chemo-immune collaborative activity was found to occur when
selected schedules of BCNU administration were employed. Moreover, synergist
effects were also detected between chemotherapy and both specific and
non-specific immunotherapy.
