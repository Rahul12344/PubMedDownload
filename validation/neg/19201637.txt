This report describes a nosocomial outbreak of feline calicivirus (FCV)
associated virulent systemic disease (VSD) in a French veterinary teaching
hospital in 2005. The outbreak started in March and resolved within 1 month.
Signs, clinical course, clinicopathological findings and lesions were typical of 
FCV-induced VSD. FCV infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Among the eight infected cats, 
two had to be euthanased, three died, and three recovered after medical
treatment. Virus could not be confined inside the animal hospital and on two
occasions, students' own cats became infected. Subsequent genetic sequencing
studies confirmed that the eight cats were infected with the same strain of
virus, and that it was distinct from those involved in the US and UK outbreaks of
VSD. Virulence and viral excretion patterns of the isolated strain were further
characterised by experimental infection.
