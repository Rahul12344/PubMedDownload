Escherichia coli WG5, the strain recommended by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) to detect somatic coliphages, was transformed to F(+)
by introducing the plasmid Famp, which rendered it capable of simultaneously
detecting both somatic and F-specific coliphages. Indeed, this strain, CB390,
proved as effective in detecting similar numbers of phages as the sum of somatic 
and F-specific bacteriophages detected by the host strains recommended by both
the ISO and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standardized methods.
