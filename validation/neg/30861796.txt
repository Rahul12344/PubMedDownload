The effect of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) on total yield and yield
components of various resistant F1 tomato cultivars and new breeding lines was
evaluated in the field. Seeds of the F1 hybrids 8484, 3761, Fiona, and Tyking and
the new breeding lines TY172 and TY197 were sown in an insect-proof greenhouse.
When the seedlings reached the first-leaf stage, they were inoculated with TYLCV 
by means of the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. Noninoculated plants of the same 
cultivar or line which were exposed to nonviruliferous whiteflies served as
controls. After a short recovery period, the plants were transplanted to the
field. The inoculated plants of each cultivar or line were compared with their
respective control, noninoculated plants, in terms of total yield, average fruit 
weight and number, and plant fresh weight. Disease symptom development and virus 
accumulation in the inoculated plants were monitored. There were substantial
differences among the different entries tested in the extent of yield loss
relative to the corresponding noninoculated control plants as well as viral DNA
accumulation levels. Plants of TY172 and TY197 suffered the least relative yield 
loss and contained the lowest level of viral DNA. Therefore, these two lines
exhibited the highest level of resistance. These results clearly demonstrate the 
ability of the various resistant tomato cultivars and lines to inhibit the
effects of the virus, even following inoculation at a very early stage of plant
development.
