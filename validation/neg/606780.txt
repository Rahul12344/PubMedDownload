Reactivity and immunogenicity of three inactivated, zonally purified, monovalent 
influenza A/swine virus vaccines were studied in children and adults. Each dose
of vaccine contained either 400 chick cell-agglutinating (CCA) units/0.5 ml or
200 CCA units/0.25 ml. The vaccines contained either whole virus or
ether-extracted, subunit virus with or without 1.5 mg of A1PO4/0.5 ml. Children
younger than 10 years of age received a half dose. Substantial system reactions, 
including temperature increases of 2.2 F-4.9 F, were observed in all children who
received whole-virus vaccines. In contrast, ether-extracted, subunit vaccines
(with or without A1PO4) were minimally pyrogenic in 185 subjects. Two doses of
subunit vaccine in subjects younger than 25 years of age were immunologically
equivalent to a single dose in older subjects. We concluded that two doses of
ether-extracted, subunit virus vaccine with Hsw1N1 antigen, administered at least
four weeks apart, are serologically effective for immunization of seronegative
subjects of any age and that this dosage regimen should be used in young children
in whom whole-virus vaccines are unacceptably reactive.
