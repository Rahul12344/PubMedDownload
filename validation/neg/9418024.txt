The presence of bacteriophages infecting enteric bacteria was tested in more than
1500 drinking water samples in Israel and Spain. Bacteriophages tested were
somatic coliphages, F-specific bacteriophages and Bacteroides fragilis
bacteriophages. The three groups of bacteriophage were isolated in 100 ml water
samples by the presence/absence test with similar frequencies, which ranged from 
4.4% for somatic coliphages to 6.1% for bacteriophages infecting Bact. fragilis. 
In contrast, the frequency of isolation of bacteriophages was significantly
higher than the frequency of isolation of faecal coliforms, which averaged only
1.9%. No significant differences were observed between the frequencies of
isolation between the samples tested in Spain and those tested in Israel. The
percentage of groundwater samples containing faecal coliforms and somatic
coliphages was reduced significantly by chlorination, despite known deficiencies.
However, there was no effect on the occurrence of F-specific bacteriophages and
Bact. fragilis bacteriophages.
