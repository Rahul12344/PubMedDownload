Pleconaril is a broad-spectrum antirhinovirus and antienterovirus compound that
binds into a hydrophobic pocket within viral protein 1, stabilizing the capsid
and resulting in the inhibition of cell attachment and RNA uncoating. When
crystals of human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16) and HRV14 are incubated with pleconaril, 
drug occupancy in the binding pocket is lower than when pleconaril is introduced 
during assembly prior to crystallization. This effect is far more marked in HRV16
than in HRV14 and is more marked with pleconaril than with other compounds. These
observations are consistent with virus yield inhibition studies and radiolabeled 
drug binding studies showing that the antiviral effect of pleconaril against
HRV16 is greater on the infectivity of progeny virions than the parent input
viruses. These data suggest that drug integration into the binding pocket during 
assembly, or at some other late stage in virus replication, may contribute to the
antiviral activity of capsid binding compounds.
