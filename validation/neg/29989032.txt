Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the common cause leading to
chronic liver diseases recently. Unlikely past humankind history, NAFLD is like a
new illness especially in developed countries due to decreased number of hepatic 
virus carriers and increased population with obesity. Among subjects with NAFLD, 
development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a key pathological step
which determines the clinical progression. This study reports a case of a boy who
has suffered from NASH for 2 years. This study aims to discuss the clinical
feature, risk aspect, and treatment strategy of NASH as well as potential of
traditional Korean medicine (TKM) therapies.
