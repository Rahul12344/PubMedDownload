The cellular SUMOylation system affects the function of numerous viral proteins. 
Hence, the identification of novel viral targets for the Small Ubiquitin-like
MOdifier (SUMO) is key to our understanding of virus-host interactions. The data 
obtained in this study demonstrate that the non-structural influenza A viral
protein NS1A is an authentic SUMO target through the use of a dicistronic
expression plasmid containing SUMO (the modifier) and Ubc9 (the SUMO-conjugating 
enzyme) separated by an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES). This dual
expression plasmid produces a robust increase in cellular SUMOylation, therefore 
facilitating the characterization of cellular and viral SUMO targets. The
identification of NS1A as a bona fide SUMO target suggests, for the first time, a
role for SUMOylation during influenza virus infection.
