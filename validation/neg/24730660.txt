The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment has improved our
understanding and management of complex pharmacological issues that have driven
improved outcomes and quality of life of the HIV-infected patient. These issues
include adherence, long- and short-term toxicities, pharmacoenhancement,
pharmacogenomics, therapeutic drug monitoring, differential penetration of drugs 
into sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system, genital tract and small
bowel, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions related to cytochrome P450
drug-metabolizing enzymes, uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases and drug
transporters, to name a few. There is future promise, as an increased
understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV and global public health
initiatives are driving novel treatment approaches with goals to prevent, control
and, ultimately, eradicate HIV.
