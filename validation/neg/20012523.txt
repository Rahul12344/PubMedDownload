TRIM5alpha protein blocks retroviral replication at early postentry stage
reducing the accumulation of reverse transcriptase products. TRIM5alpha proteins 
of Old World primates restrict HIV-1 infection whereas TRIM5alpha proteins of
most New World monkeys restrict SIV(mac) infection. TRIM5alpha protein has a RING
domain, B-box 2 domain, coiled-coil domain, and PRYSPRY domain. The PRYSPRY
domain of TRIM5alpha determines viral specificity and restriction potency by
mediating recognition of the retroviral capsid. The coiled-coil domain is
essential for TRIM5alpha oligomerization, which contributes to binding avidity
for the viral capsid. The RING domain and B-box 2 domain are required for
efficient restriction activity of TRIM5alpha protein but the mechanisms remain to
be defined.
