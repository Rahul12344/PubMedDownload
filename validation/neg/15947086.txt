In the new World Health Organization/European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (WHO/EORTC) classification of cutaneous lymphomas, large
B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) are divided into 3 groups: LBCL, leg-type (LBCLLT);
follicle center lymphoma, diffuse type (FCLDT); and LBCL, others (LBCLO). We
studied a large number of primary cutaneous LBCLs to test the validity of the
classification and to identify prognostic factors for these patients.
Ninety-three cases of primary cutaneous LBCL were analyzed for clinicopathologic 
features, expression of several markers including Bcl-2, Bcl-6, MUM-1, and
FOX-P1, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus, and molecular analyses of
IGH gene rearrangement and of Borrelia burgdorferi and human herpesvirus 8 DNA.
Patients were classified into the following categories: FCLDT, 44 cases; LBCLLT, 
40 cases; and LBCLO, 9 cases. Statistical analyses showed that the LBCLLT and
FCLDT groups were clearly distinct in terms of clinicopathologic features and
survival. The LBCLO group had features in between those of LBCLLT and FCLDT. Our 
study shows that accurate morphologic and phenotypic analyses allow us to
stratify most patients into the prognostically different categories of LBCLLT and
FCLDT. The definition of a third category of LBCLO requires further studies to
clarify whether these cases indeed show distinct clinicopathologic features.
