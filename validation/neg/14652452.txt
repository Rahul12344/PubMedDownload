A 7-year-old boy from an area endemic to Japanese encephalitis (JE) manifested
with acute febrile illness, left hemiplegia and preserved consciousness during
the prodromal phase of illness. The child developed features of encephalitis 48
hours after the onset of hemiplegia. IgM MAC ELISA for JE virus revealed high
titers in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid suggestive of JE. MRI of the brain
showed asymmetrical bilateral thalamic hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted image,
considered diagnostic of JE. Hemiplegia during the prodromal phase or as an
initial symptom of JE is rather unusual.
