The role of rubella in the etiology of supravalvular aortic stenosis.

Vince DJ.

The possibility of an etiological relationship between rubella embryopathy and
sporadic forms of supravalvular aortic stenosis is considered. A case is
presented of a patient with rubella embryopathy and supravalvular aortic stenosis
associated with pulmonary valvular and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis,
bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis and subendothelial myocardial
fibrosis. A review of the literature revealed many clinical and pathological
features common to both syndromes. The hypothesis that rubella virus produced
germ-cell mutation and subsequent persistence of rubella in the zygote produced
further fetal damage is presented to explain these observations.
