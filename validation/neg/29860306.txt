Several co-pathogens that pose threats to the fetus during gestation, including
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), may also contribute to mother-to-child transmission
(MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Within endemic settings,
associations between maternal HCMV viral load and increased incidence of MTCT of 
HIV-1 are documented; however, the mechanisms that promote transmission are
poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that HCMV coinfection enhances
susceptibility and viral replication of HIV-1 in placental macrophages (Hofbauer 
cells) in vitro. Consistent with enhanced viral susceptibility, HCMV exposure
upregulates CCR5 and CD80 expression on Hofbauer cells. HCMV also significantly
induces type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and antiviral gene
expression. Interestingly, we found that HCMV diminishes type I IFN-mediated
phosphorylation of STAT2. Collectively, our data suggest that HCMV-induced
activation, local inflammation, and antagonism of type I IFN responses in
placental Hofbauer cells promote in utero transmission of HIV-1.
