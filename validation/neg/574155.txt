cells.

The replication of influenza viruses A/NWS-D, A/WS-MK and their r12 recombinant
in human embryo fibroblast (HEF) and human diploid fibroblast (LEP) cell lines
was studied. In HEF cells virus NWS-D and recombinant r12 induced synthesis of
virus-specific macromolecules and produced infectious virions; virus WS-MK
induced synthesis of virus complementary RNA (cRNA), virion RNA (vRNA), protein, 
RNP and non-infectious virions, but haemagglutinin cleavage was impaired and the 
virions formed contained uncleaved haemagglutinin. In LEP cells, infectious
virions were formed only by virus NWS-D; viruses WS-MK and r12 induced synthesis 
of virus cRNA, vRNA, proteins and RNP; virus r12 had the haemagglutinin cleaved, 
whereas in virus WS-MK this process was impaired; neither virus WS-MK nor r12 was
capable of forming virions. Analysis of the recombinant r12 genome showed that it
had only inherited a single gene from NWS-D, the one coding for neuraminidase,
having inherited all others (P1, P2, P3, HA, NP, M, NS) from WS-MK. The data
obtained suggested that the inability of virus WS-MK to form infectious virions
in HEF cells is due to the character of its neuraminidase, which is incapable of 
participating in haemagglutinin cleavage. The deficient reproduction of this
virus in the other host-cell system (LEP) is apparently associated with some
characteristics of another protein (other proteins) of this virus.
