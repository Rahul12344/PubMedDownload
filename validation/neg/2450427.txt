Various lymphocyte populations, dendritic cells and macrophages contribute to the
intake of antigen. The transportation of antigen in the intestinal wall is
possible with the help of receptive endocytosis, including extracellular protein 
in fluid droplets, bacterial and vegetable toxins, as well as certain viruses,
which seem to be able to penetrate the cell membrane and enter directly into the 
cell. Own investigations: After endoscope controlled allergy-irritation of the
gastro-intestinal tract, 20 people used in the clinical test showed acute signs
of mucosal reaction with inflammation and swelling of the mucous membrane as well
as haemorrhagic lesions. A histamine release from the mastcell was proved.
