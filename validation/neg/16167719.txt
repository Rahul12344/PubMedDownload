BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is associated with acute infantile gastro-enteritis in
infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus is associated with the high cases
of morbidity and mortality and it is estimated that up to 650,000 deaths in young
children occur annually in the less developed countries. Approximately a quarter 
of these deaths occur in African children yet minimal data exist on the
circulating rotavirus strains in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To characterise the circulating rotavirus strains in Kenya.
DESIGN: A prospective study to investigate rotavirus infection in infants and
young children with acute diarrhoea in different areas of Kenya. Between
September 2001 and February 2002, 119 faecal specimens were collected from
children aged between 1 and 60 months with acute infantile gastro-enteritis.
SETTING: Faecal samples were collected from clinics around Nairobi and its
suburbs including Karen, Ngong, Ongata Rongai.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from 119 infants and young
children with diarrhoea and were analysed by commercial ELISA and polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to identify possible non-group A rotaviruses.
Extraction of any potential rotavirus double-stranded RNA from faeces and
characterisation by SDS-PAGE showed the presence of human group C rotaviruses.
RESULTS: Examination of these samples with a commercial ELISA assay for the
presence of group A rotavirus antigen showed that 13 specimens (11%) were
positive. An analysis of all stool specimens was performed by polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis to identify possible non-group A rotaviruses. Extraction of any
potential rotavirus double-stranded RNA from faeces and characterisation by
SDS-PAGE showed the presence of human group C rotaviruses.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of group C rotaviruses in Kenya. Further
studies are underway to continue the surveillance of rotavirus strains in Kenya; 
as this information will be useful in planning rotavirus vaccine trials in
Africa.
