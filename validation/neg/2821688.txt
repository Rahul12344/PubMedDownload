Infection in vitro of differentiating chick embryo neuroretinal cells with avian 
sarcoma viruses UR1 and UR2 results in mitogenic stimulation and morphologic
conversion of both support neuronal cells. This was shown by the continuous
propagation of transformed cells for over 4 months and growth of reaggregated
colonies in liquid medium as well as in soft agar. Production of the transforming
proteins p 150 gag-fps and p68 gag-ros of UR1 and UR2, respectively, was similar 
to that of transformed chick embryo fibroblasts, as judged from in vitro kinase
activity assays. The two protein subunits, T beta and T gamma, but not T alpha of
the GTP binding protein transducin, found in the retina of many animal species,
were present in control neuroretinal cells. Infection with Rous sarcoma virus or 
UR2 resulted in an inhibition of T gamma synthesis and enhancement of T beta-like
protein production.
