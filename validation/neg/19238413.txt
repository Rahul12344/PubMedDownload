PURPOSE: To elucidate the clinicopathologic features of lymphoepithelioma-like
carcinoma (LELC) of the uterine cervix, we examined three Japanese cases.
METHODS: We collected three cases of LELC of the uterine cervix between 2000 and 
2007. We examined these patients' clinicopathologic data, Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infectious status, and infiltrated
lymphocyte population.
RESULTS: Our patients had disease Fédération Internatinale de Gynécologie et
d'Obstétrique stages I and II. All of them were free of disease at the time of
the study. Macroscopically, one of the three tumors was polypoid. All tumor cells
were negative for EBV and HPV using in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry. The inflammatory background contained many CD3(+) and
CD8(+) cells, but there were few CD4(+), CD20(+), or CD79a(+) cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In our Japanese series, LELC of the uterine cervix showed good
prognosis, and there is no relationship between this carcinoma and EBV or HPV
infection.
