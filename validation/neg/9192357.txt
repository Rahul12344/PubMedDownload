Non-cytopathogenic (NCP) viruses of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus were
detected at a low ratio by the reverse plaque formation method from virus samples
after several plaque clonings of cytopathogenic (CP) BVD viruses; NADL and Osloss
strains. This phenomenon suggests that the NCP BVD viruses are produced at a low 
ratio during the propagation of CP BVD viruses in vitro. To investigate the
differences between the parent CP BVD virus and the NCP BVD virus as a real
progeny, the regions flanking the insertion of cellular mRNA in the p125 domain
of NADL and Osloss strains were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pGEM 3Z
plasmid vector, and then sequenced. Consequently, it was confirmed that sequences
of cellular mRNA insertion of CP BVD viruses, NADL and Osloss strains, were
completely and exactly deleted from the NCP BVD viruses which were real progeny
of CP BVD viruses, NADL and Osloss strains. These results suggest that NCP BVD
viruses may revert from CP biotype to NCP biotype by the deletion of cellular
mRNA insertion in the viral genome of CP BVD viruses (NADL and Osloss strains).
