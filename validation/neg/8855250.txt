The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter is regulated by steroid hormones
through a hormone-responsive region that is organized in a positioned nucleosome.
Hormone induction leads to a structural change of this nucleosome which makes its
DNA more sensitive to cleavage by DNase I and enables simultaneous binding of all
relevant transcription factors. In cells carrying either episomal or
chromosomally integrated MMTV promoters, moderate acetylation of core histones,
generated by treatment with low concentrations of the histone deacetylase
inhibitors sodium butyrate or trichostatin A, enhances transcription from the
MMTV promoter in the absence of hormone and potentiates transactivation by either
glucocorticoids or progestins. At higher concentrations, histone deacetylase
inhibitors reduce basal and hormone induced MMTV transcription. Inducing
inhibitor concentrations lead to the same type of nucleosomal DNase I
hypersensitivity as hormone treatment, suggesting that moderate acetylation of
core histone activates the MMTV promoter by mechanisms involving chromatin
remodeling similar to that generated by the inducing hormones.
