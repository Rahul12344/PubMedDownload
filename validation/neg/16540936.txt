Sequence polymorphism in HIV type 1 env gene is quite high, and there are little 
data available for subtype C env gp41 sequences from India. We have presented a
molecular sequence analysis for gp41 region of env gene from HIV type 1 subtype
C-infected individuals. The samples were obtained from 3 acute seroconverters and
5 seropositive individuals from India, one of whom was a minor. Heteroduplex
mobility analysis using V3V5 and gp41 confirmed subtype C infection in all the
study subjects. The sequences were analyzed for heterogeneity, polymorphism, and 
epitope recognition. The phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis showed the
monophyletic lineage of Indian sequences. The phylogenetic tree constructed for
the 286- to 506-bp region is highly variable and clearly distinguishes the
subtype C sequences. The interpatient sequence comparison revealed high genetic
diversity ranging from 0.0623 to 2.18 (median, 0.119). This supports the
phylogeny where sequences belonging to the 8 study subjects form subclusters
within Indian subtype C. A majority of the functional domains of gp41 are well
conserved for the seroconverter and seropositive sequences. However, sequence
polymorphism is high for the sequences obtained from the minor. The sequences of 
gp41 would provide valuable information regarding the diversity and its
diagnostic implications in HIV/AIDS research.
