Measles virus (MV) infects dendritic cells (DCs) resulting in immunosuppression. 
Human DCs express two MV receptors: CD46 and human signaling lymphocyte
activation molecule (hSLAM); thus, the role played by either alone is unclear.
Because wild-type (wt) MV uses hSLAM receptor preferentially, we dissected the
molecular basis of MV-DC interaction and resultant immunosuppression through the 
hSLAM receptor by creating transgenic (tg) mice expressing hSLAM on DCs. After
infection with wt MV, murine splenic DCs expressing hSLAM receptor had less B7-1,
B7-2, CD40, MHC class I, and MHC class II molecules on their surfaces and
displayed an increased rate of apoptosis when compared to uninfected DCs.
Further, MV-infected DCs failed to stimulate allogeneic T cells and inhibited
mitogen-dependent T-cell proliferation. Individual expression of human SLAM,
interferon alpha/beta receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and
lymphotoxin-alpha or beta from T cells was not required for MV-infected DCs to
inhibit the proliferation of T cells.
