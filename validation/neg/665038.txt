[Effect of hyperimmunization with tick-borne encephalitis virus on lipid
metabolism].

[Article in Russian]

Fedorov TS, Sevast'ianova VA.

Prolonged administration to rabbits of the brain tissue of albino mice and of the
cell culture of chick embryo with and without the tick-borne encephalitis virus
was accompanied by the changes in the qualitative fatty acid composition in the
blood serum in the direction of increase of the polyunsaturated compounds; iodine
number increased in the liver. A five-cycle immunization with the
virus-containing material and with the brain tissue led to the rise in the
content of blood serum beta-lipoproteins. The noted deviations were more
pronounced in using the tick-borne encephalitis virus. Hyperimmunization with the
virus-containing antigen promoted elevation of the lipolytic activity of the
blood serum and of the liver tissue.
