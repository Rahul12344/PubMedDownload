Toroidal DNA condensates have received considerable attention for their possible 
relationship to the packaging of DNA in viruses and in general as a model of
ordered DNA condensation. A spool-like model has primarily been supported for DNA
organization within toroids. However, our observations suggest that the actual
organization may be considerably different. We present an alternate model in
which DNA for a given toroid is organized within a series of equally sized
contiguous loops that precess about the toroid axis. A related model for the
toroid formation process is also presented. This kinetic model predicts a
distribution of toroid sizes for DNA condensed from solution that is in good
agreement with experimental data.
