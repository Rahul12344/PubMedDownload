Baculoviral vectors can transduce neurons in the CNS but mediate only transient
expression of transgenes. We have developed a new baculoviral vector in which the
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of adeno-associated virus are used to flank a
luciferase reporter gene cassette harboring a neuron-specific promoter. When
tested in rat brain, the new viral vector was able to provide transgene
expression for at least 90 days. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated that
ITR flanking did not affect the cellular preference of the neuronal promoter in
the context of baculovirus. These findings establish an effective way to engineer
baculoviral vectors in order to achieve sustained expression of a functional gene
for gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders and physiological studies of
neurons.
