BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) with a history of eczema
herpeticum have increased staphylococcal colonization and infections. However,
whether Staphylococcus aureus alters the outcome of skin viral infection has not 
been determined.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether S aureus toxins modulated host response to
herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and vaccinia virus (VV) infections in normal human
keratinocytes (NHKs) and in murine infection models.
METHODS: NHKs were treated with S aureus toxins before incubation of viruses.
BALB/c mice were inoculated with S aureus 2 days before VV scarification. Viral
loads of HSV-1 and VV were evaluated by using real-time PCR, a viral
plaque-forming assay, and immunofluorescence staining. Small interfering RNA
duplexes were used to knockdown the gene expression of the cellular receptor of
α-toxin, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10). ADAM10 protein and
α-toxin heptamers were detected by using Western blot assays.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that sublytic staphylococcal α-toxin increases viral
loads of HSV-1 and VV in NHKs. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo that the VV
load is significantly greater (P < .05) in murine skin inoculated with an
α-toxin-producing S aureus strain compared with murine skin inoculated with the
isogenic α-toxin-deleted strain. The viral enhancing effect of α-toxin is
mediated by ADAM10 and is associated with its pore-forming property. Moreover, we
demonstrate that α-toxin promotes viral entry in NHKs.
CONCLUSION: The current study introduces the novel concept that staphylococcal
α-toxin promotes viral skin infection and provides a mechanism by which S aureus 
infection might predispose the host toward disseminated viral infections.
