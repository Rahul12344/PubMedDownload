AIM: Saliva can play an important role in human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)
transmission in endemic regions for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Little is known about 
HHV-8 oral shedding in immunocompetent individuals from non-endemic regions for
KS.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of HHV-8 salivary excretion among 59
healthy, immunocompetent individuals from São Paulo, Brazil, followed up weekly
for 4 months, resulting in 16 saliva samples from each participant. Antibodies to
HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and lytic-phase antigens were
investigated with immunofluorescence assays (IFA). HHV-8 DNA detection was
performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: All 59 individuals were seronegative to LANA and lytic antibodies. HHV-8
DNA was undetectable in saliva samples in 100% of the participants, totaling 944 
samples and being consistently negative during the different periods of sampling,
which lasted approximately 120 days. No sequences of HHV-8 DNA were detected in
the saliva samples of healthy, immunocompetent adults by using real-time PCR,
with the resulting data being consistent with IFA-based serological tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other herpesviruses, HHV-8 is not excreted in the saliva of
healthy individuals from non-endemic regions for KS.
