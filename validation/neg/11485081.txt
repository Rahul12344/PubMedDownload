Cutaneous manifestations are common clinical findings among HIV positive
patients. The causes may be bacteria, viruses, fungi and other non-infectious
agents. This study was conducted at the Pramongkutklao Hospital skin clinic to
determine the frequency distribution of cutaneous manifestations in HIV positive 
patients. A total of 147 patients with HIV seropositivity were recruited and
divided into a retrospective group and a prospective study group. For the
retrospective study, hospital records of 129 patients who attended from January
1995 to November 1998 were recruited. The prospective study was carried out from 
November 1998 to January 1999 and 18 patients were recruited. Cutaneous finding
among patients in the two studies were evaluated. There were ten common cutaneous
manifestations observed in the retrospective and prospective study including
pruritic papular eruptions (PPE) (51.2%, 50%), oral candidiasis (16.7%, 21.7%),
herpes zoster (10.9%, 5.6%), oral hairy leukoplakia (10%, 5.6%), unclassified
eczema (9%, 11.1%), urticaria (5.6%, 3.1%), seborrheic dermatitis (4.7%, 16.7%), 
folliculitis (4.7%, 5.6%), prurigo simplex (4.7%, 5.6%), and Steven-Johnson
syndrome (3.9%, 0%). However, the distribution of cutaneous manifestations in the
two studies were not significantly different. These findings may be useful as
baseline data for common cutaneous manifestations in HIV positive patients.
