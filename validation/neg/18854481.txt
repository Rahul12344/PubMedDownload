SUMMARY: The unique life cycle of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and its ability to
infect both nondividing and dividing cells with persistent expression have made
it an attractive vector. An additional attractive feature of the wild-type virus 
is the lack of apparent pathogenicity. Gene transfer studies using AAV have shown
significant progress at the level of animal models; clinical trials have been
noteworthy with respect to the safety of AAV vectors. No proven efficacy has been
observed, although in some instances, there have been promising observations. In 
this review, topics in AAV biology are supplemented with a section on AAV
clinical trials with emphasis on the need for a deeper understanding of AAV
biology and the development of efficient AAV vectors. In addition, several novel 
approaches and recent findings that promise to expand AAV's utility are
discussed, especially in the context of combining gene therapy ex vivo with new
advances in stem or progenitor cell biology.
