INTRODUCTION: Different dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been associated with
greater epidemic potential. In turn, the increased frequency in cases of severe
forms of dengue has been associated with the cocirculation of several serotypes. 
Because Colombia is a country with an endemic presence of all four DENV
serotypes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro
replication of the DENV-2 and DENV-3 strains under individual infection and
coinfection conditions.
METHODOLOGY: C6/36HT cells were infected with the two strains individually or
simultaneously (coinfection). Replication capacity was evaluated by RT-qPCR, and 
the effects on cell viability were assessed with an MTT (3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Additionally,
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were artificially fed the two strains of each serotype
individually or simultaneously. The viral genomes were quantified by RT-qPCR and 
the survival of the infected mosquitoes was compared to that of uninfected
controls.
RESULTS: In single infections, three strains significantly affected C6/36HT cell 
viability, but no significant differences were found in the replication
capacities of the strains of the same serotype. In the in vivo infections,
mosquito survival was not affected, and no significant differences in replication
between strains of the same serotype were found. Finally, in coinfections,
serotype 2 replicated with a thousandfold greater efficiency than serotype 3 did 
both in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the cocirculation of serotypes in endemic regions, further
studies of coinfections in a natural environment would further an understanding
of the transmission dynamics that affect DENV infection epidemiology.
