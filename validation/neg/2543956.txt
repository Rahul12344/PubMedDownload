Recently we tentatively identified, by sequence comparison, central domains of
the NS3 proteins of flaviviruses and the respective portion of the pestivirus
polyprotein as RNA helicases (A.E.G. et al., submitted). Alignment of the
N-proximal domains of the same proteins revealed conservation of short sequence
stretches resembling those around the catalytic Ser, His and Asp residues of
chymotrypsin-like proteases. A statistically significant similarity has been
detected between the sequences of these domains and those of the C-terminal
serine protease domains of alphavirus capsid proteins. It is suggested that
flavivirus NS3 and the respective pestivirus protein contain at least two
functional domains, the N-proximal protease and the C-proximal helicase one. The 
protease domain is probably involved in the processing of viral non-structural
proteins.
