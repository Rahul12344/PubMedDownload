Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a severe disease with high
mortality and morbidity in spite of the development of effective anti-viral
therapies. The viral load in neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was
measured retrospectively in 37 patients. HSV DNA copy numbers in serum and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were quantified using a real-time PCR assay. Patients
with disseminated infection had a higher viral load in their sera. whereas
patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection exhibited a higher viral
load in the CSF. The viral load was significantly higher in the serum of patients
who died later. Interestingly, patients with HSV type-2 infection exhibited more 
CNS involvement and neurological impairment, together with a high viral load in
the CSF, than did HSV type-1 patients. These results suggest that quantitation of
HSV viral load may be useful for assessing the prognosis, and may provide
additional information for the management of neonatal HSV infection.
