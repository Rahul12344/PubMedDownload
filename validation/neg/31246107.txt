BACKGROUND: Interindividual variability in susceptibility remains poorly
characterized for environmental chemicals such as tetrachloroethylene (PERC).
Development of population-based experimental models provide a potential approach 
to fill this critical need in human health risk assessment.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to better characterize the contribution of
glutathione (GSH) conjugation to kidney toxicity of PERC and the degree of
associated interindividual toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) variability 
by using the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population.
METHODS: Male mice from 45 strains were intragastrically dosed with PERC
([Formula: see text]) or vehicle (5% Alkamuls EL-620 in saline), and time-course 
samples were collected for up to 24 h. Population variability in TK of
S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)GSH (TCVG), S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (TCVC),
and N-acetyl-S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (NAcTCVC) was quantified in
serum, liver, and kidney, and analyzed using a toxicokinetic model. Effects of
PERC on kidney weight, fatty acid metabolism-associated genes [ Acot1 (Acyl-CoA
thioesterase 1), Fabp1 (fatty acid-binding protein 1), and Ehhadh (enoyl-coenzyme
A, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase)], and a marker of proximal
tubular injury [KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1)/Hepatitis A virus cellular
receptor 1 ( Havcr1)] were evaluated. Finally, quantitative data on interstrain
variability in both formation of GSH conjugation metabolites of PERC and its
kidney effects was used to calculate adjustment factors for the interindividual
variability in both TK and TD.
RESULTS: Mice treated with PERC had significantly lower kidney weight, higher
kidney-to-body weight (BW) ratio, and higher expression of fatty acid
metabolism-associated genes ( Acot1, Fabp1, and Ehhadh) and a marker of proximal 
tubular injury (KIM-1/ Havcr1). Liver levels of TCVG were significantly
correlated with KIM-1/ Havcr1 in kidney, consistent with kidney injury being
associated with GSH conjugation. We found that the default uncertainty factor for
human variability may be marginally adequate to protect 95%, but not more, of the
population for kidney toxicity mediated by PERC.
DISCUSSION: Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of the CC mouse
population in characterizing metabolism-toxicity interactions and quantifying
interindividual variability. Further refinement of the characterization of
interindividual variability can be accomplished by incorporating these data into 
in silico population models both for TK (such as a physiologically based
pharmacokinetic model), as well as for toxicodynamic responses.
