Virus production with a newly developed microcarrier system.

Giard DJ, Thilly WG, Wang DI, Levine DW.

Primary cell cultures as well as established lines have been grown on a recently 
developed microcarrier configuration that overcomes the problem of toxicity
attendant on earlier developments in this technology. Virus yields from these
cells propagated on the new microcarriers have been measured. Microcarrier-grown 
cells, when compared to roller-bottle-grown cells, gave virus yields on a
per-cell basis that varied from slightly greater with the Sindbis virus-Chinese
hamster ovary cells and polio-WI-38 combinations to approximately one-third with 
Moloney murine leukemia virus-Cl-1 mouse cells and vesicular stomatitis
virus-chicken embryo fibroblasts. Yields ranged from 8.0 X 10(7) to 3.6 X 10(8)
cells per 100-ml microcarrier culture and from 3.7 X 10(7) to 4.1 X 20(8) cells
per roller-bottle culture. Secondary chicken embryo fibroblast yields were
approximately four times as great in microcarrier cultures as in standard
roller-bottle cultures, per unit volume of medium consumed. In spite of the
reduced virus yields per cell seen in some instances, the greater cellular
productivity of microcarrier cultures appears to hold great promise for
large-scale virus production. Optimizing microcarrier conditions for specific
cell-virus systems should result in improved yields.
