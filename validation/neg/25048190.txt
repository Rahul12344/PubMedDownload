OBJECTIVE: To compare pulmonary high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings in patients
with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia to HRCT findings in patients with
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia.
METHODS: We studied 124 patients (77 men, 47 women; age range, 20-89 years; mean 
age, 65.4 years) with P. aeruginosa pneumonia and 44 patients (22 men, 22 women; 
age range, 36-86 years; mean age, 63.2 years) with CMV pneumonia.
RESULTS: CT findings of consolidation (p < 0.005), bronchial wall thickening
(p < 0.001), cavity (p < 0.05), and pleural effusion (p < 0.001) were
significantly more frequent in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia than in
those with CMV pneumonia. Centrilobular nodules, a crazy-paving appearance, and
nodules were significantly more frequent in patients with CMV pneumonia than in
those with P. aeruginosa pneumonia (all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary HRCT findings, such as bronchial wall thickening,
crazy-paving appearance, and nodules may be useful in distinguishing between P.
aeruginosa pneumonia and CMV pneumonia.
KEY POINTS: Distinguishing Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia from Cytomegalovirus 
pneumonia is important. Characteristic features of underlying conditions are
present in each pneumonia species. Bronchial wall thickening and cavities are
more frequent in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Nodules and a crazy-paving
appearance are more frequent in Cytomegalovirus pneumonia.
