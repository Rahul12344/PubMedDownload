A multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method that has been developed is
capable of detecting and subtyping influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses as
well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B in respiratory clinical
samples taken as part of a national community-based surveillance program of
influenza-like illness in England and Wales. The detection of each different
pathogen depended on distinguishing five amplification products of different
sizes on agarose gels following RT-PCR with multiple primer sets. The multiplex
RT-PCR was tested with 65 nasopharyngeal apirates from which RSV had been
isolated and 237 combined nose and throat swabs from which influenza A (H1N1 and 
H3N2) or B virus had been detected by virus isolation, as well as 40 respiratory 
samples from which other viruses including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus,
enteroviruses, and parainfluenza viruses had been grown. For the typing and
subtyping of influenza A and B viruses and RSV types A and B, the multiplex
RT-PCR gave an excellent (100%) correlation with the results of conventional
typing and subtyping with specific antisera. Multiplex RT-PCR can also be used to
accurately detect more than one viral template in the same reaction mixture,
allowing viral coinfections to be identified with the same respiratory specimen.
