BACKGROUND: The natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers and the
effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) have not been fully elucidated among
hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: Eighty-four anti-HCV antibody- and HCV RNA-positive and 154 anti-HCV
antibody-negative HD patients who were retrospectively observed for at least 3
years were analyzed. We investigated the factors associated with thrombocytopenia
(< 1.3 x 10(5)/microL) and decreased platelet count (PLT) (more than 20% decrease
during the follow-up period), which were considered to be indicators of hepatic
fibrosis. In addition, another 16 HD patients with HCV who received 300 mg/day
UDCA orally for at least 6 months were investigated. Changes in alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT) and PLT were assessed.
RESULTS: After the 60.3-months mean follow-up period, HCV infection was
independently associated with both thrombocytopenia [odds ratio (OR) 2.589] and
decreased PLT (OR 2.339) in 238 HD patients. In 84 HD patients with HCV, the
average ALT levels (> or = 15 IU/L) during the follow-up period was associated
with thrombocytopenia (OR 3.882) and decreased PLT (OR 4.470). In addition, ALT, 
AST and GGT significantly decreased at 6 months after starting UDCA, but PLT did 
not change in 16 HD patients with HCV.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HCV infection is a risk for
thrombocytopenia which should be associated with hepatic fibrosis in HD patients.
In addition, the clinical course of ALT levels predicts the progression of
thrombocytopenia, and UDCA may effectively lower ALT levels in HD patients with
HCV.
