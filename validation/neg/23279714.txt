We implemented a questionnaire-based methodology targeting veterinary field
practitioners to evaluate clinical and economic impact of Schmallenberg virus in 
Belgium. First suspicious cases were detected as soon as July 2011. The mean cost
for individual symptomatic treatment was 65 or 107 Euros, in case of fatal
outcome or apparent recovery, respectively.
