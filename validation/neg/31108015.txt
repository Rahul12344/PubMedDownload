Ruzasvir (MK-8408, an NS5A inhibitor) and uprifosbuvir (MK-3682, a nonstructural 
protein 5B nucleotide inhibitor) are highly potent direct-acting antiviral agents
for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A phase III clinical
trial evaluating the two-drug combination of ruzasvir 60 mg plus  uprifosbuvir
450 mg suggested suboptimal efficacy in certain HCV genotypes (C-BREEZE 1;
NCT02759315). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of ruzasvir in combination with uprifosbuvir administered at a higher dose
than that assessed in the earlier study (C-BREEZE 2: NCT02956629/Merck protocol
PN041). Treatment-naïve or interferon (with or without ribavirin)-experienced
participants with or without compensated cirrhosis were enrolled. All
participants received ruzasvir 180 mg plus uprifosbuvir 450 mg once daily for
12 weeks. The primary objectives were the proportion of participants with HCV RNA
<15 lU/mL at 12 weeks after the end of study therapy (SVR12), and safety and
tolerability of the study drug. Overall, 282 participants were enrolled. SVR12
(n/N) was 91.3% (42/46) in participants infected with HCV genotype (GT) 1a; GT1b,
96.7% (29/30); GT2, 91.5% (43/47); GT3, 73.8% (45/61); GT4, 98.2% (55/56); GT5,
100.0% (18/18); and GT6, 90.9% (20/22). Adverse events (AEs) were reported by
61.3% of participants; drug-related AEs were reported by 33.3%. The most frequent
(≥5% of participants) drug-related AEs in all participants were fatigue (7.8%)
and headache (7.4%). In conclusion, the two-drug combination of ruzasvir 180 mg
plus uprifosbuvir 450 mg for 12 weeks was highly effective and well tolerated in 
participants infected with HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6, with a lower efficacy 
in GT3-infected persons.
