A virus-activated matrix is developed to overcome the challenge of forming
vascularized bone tissue. It is generated by filling a 3D printed bioceramic
scaffold with phage nanofibers displaying high-density RGD peptide. After it is
seeded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and implanted into a bone defect, the
phage nanofibers induce osteogenesis and angiogenesis by activating
endothelialization and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
