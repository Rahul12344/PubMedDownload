Biological characterization of avian osteopetrosis.

Banes AJ, Smith RE.

Chicks infected as 12-day-old embryos with an end-point purified derivative of
avian myeloblastosis virus developed a rapidly progressive osteopetrosis that
manifested within 1 week of hatching. A detailed comparison of osteopetrotic
chicks and normal hatchmates revealed the following. (i) Osteopetrotic chicks
exhibited a stunting syndrome, growing at a mean rate that was 26% of the control
rats. (ii) At autopsy, the mass of the lymphoid organs was reduced, whereas the
mass of the heart, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, brain, liver, and bones of
osteopetrotic chicks was increased. Edema was likely responsible for most of the 
increase in organ weight. (iii) Infected chicks exhibited a normochromic,
normocytic anemia that was virus dose dependent and was not required for the
development of osteopetrosis. (iv) Bone collagen content was normal. (v)
Osteopetrotic bone was initially hypomineralized, but later became more fully
mineralized. (vi) The concentrations of alpha, beta, and gamma globulins in the
plasma were elevated in osteopetrotic chicks, whereas albumin concentration was
decreased. (vii) The level of plasma alkaline phosphatase was elevated in
osteopetrotic chicks, yet the level of acid phosphatase was unchanged. (viii)
Body and bone temperatures were unchanged.
