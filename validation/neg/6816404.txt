[Identification of lymphocyte populations producing alpha-interferon by
monoclonal antibodies].

[Article in French]

Lebon P, Bernard A, Boumsell L.

Two different leucocyte populations producing alpha-interferon can be defined by 
monoclonal antibodies. One non glass adherent population produces interferon
after induction with Herpes and Sendaï viruses. It is characterized by anti-D44
antibody, defining both some T and NK cells, but not by anti-D66 antibody with
selective reactivity for T cells. The other glass adherent population is
identified by OKM1 antibody, which defines about 70% of the monocytes, and can be
induced only with Sendaï virus.
