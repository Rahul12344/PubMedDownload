Respiratory syncytial virus is a single-stranded RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae
family that preferentially assembles and buds from the apical surface of
polarized epithelial cells, forming filamentous structures that contain both
viral proteins and the genomic RNA. Recent studies have described both viral and 
host factors that are involved in ribonucleoprotein assembly and trafficking of
viral proteins to the cell surface. At the cell surface, viral proteins assemble 
into filaments that probably require interactions between viral proteins, host
proteins and the cell membrane. Finally, a membrane scission event must occur to 
release the free virion. This article will review the recent literature
describing the mechanisms that drive respiratory syncytial virus assembly and
budding.
