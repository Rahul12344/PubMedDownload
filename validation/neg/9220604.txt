To understand the possible mechanisms of transmission of Aujeszky's disease virus
(pseudorabies or PRV) from a feral pig reservoir, intranasal infections were
initiated in domestic pigs and in pigs from a herd derived from captured feral
pigs. Virus strains originating from feral pigs and from domestic pigs were
compared. Similar shedding patterns were obtained in both feral-derived and
domestic pigs, however, virus strains from feral pigs were markedly attenuated.
Virus could be isolated after acute infection from nasal secretions, tonsils and 
occasionally from genital organs. In studies of transmission of PRV by
cannibalism, either latently infected or acutely infected tissue was fed to both 
domestic and feral-derived pigs. In two similar experiments, latently infected
tissue did not transmit virus, but tissues from acutely infected pigs did
transmit infection. Cannibalism was observed typically in both types of pigs
older than 6 weeks of age. It was concluded that transmission of PRV originating 
from feral pigs can occur by several mechanisms including the respiratory route
and by cannibalism of pigs that die of acute infection. Transmission of PRV from 
feral swine may, however, result in sub-clinical infection.
