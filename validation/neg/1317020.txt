This study reports data concerning the prevalence of anti HCV in a population of 
166 drug addicts and 25 partners (14 drug addicts and 11 with no history of
substance abuse) of subjects proven anti HCV positive. The study was carried out 
in order to evaluate the importance of the haematic and sexual modes of
transmission of HCV. The results obtained showed a prevalence of HCV infection in
drug addicts with substantial statistic significance when compared with the
prevalence in a population of donors. There is no evidence of statistically
significant differences in prevalence between non-addicted partners and blood
donors or between addicted partners and the general population of drug addicts.
From these comparisons it is clear that haematic contact is an important source
of contagion, whereas sexual contact appears to be of minor importance.
