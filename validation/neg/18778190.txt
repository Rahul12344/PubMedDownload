Despite recent evidence suggesting that Bell's palsy is associated with
reactivation of alfa-herpes viruses, the disease has been treated empirically,
and the use of valacyclovir has not been definitively established. In 2007, two
prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trials evaluating valacyclovir were
reported in patients with Bell's palsy. One demonstrated that
valacyclovir/prednisolone therapy was statistically more effective than
placebo/prednisolone therapy in improving the recovery of patients with Bell's
palsy, excluding zoster sine herpete. However, considering the cost-benefit ratio
of this treatment and the limitations of virological diagnoses, we recommend that
valacyclovir should be used in cases of severe palsy within 3 days after the
onset of Bell's palsy.
