Viral infection is detected by the host innate immune system. Innate immune cells
such as dendritic cells and macrophages detect nucleic acids derived from viruses
through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral recognition by PRRs initiates
the activation of signaling pathways that lead to production of type I interferon
and inflammatory cytokines, which are important for the elimination of viruses.
Two types of PRRs that recognize viral nucleic acids, Toll-like receptors (TLR)
and RIG-I-like RNA helicases (RLH), have been identified. Of the TLRs, TLR3
recognizes viral double-stranded (ds) RNA, TLR7 and human TLR8 identify viral
single-stranded (ss) RNA and TLR9 detects viral DNA. TLRs are located in
endosomal compartments, whereas RLH are present in the cytoplasm where they
detect viral dsRNA or ssRNA. Here we review the role of TLRs and RLHs in the
antiviral innate immune response.
