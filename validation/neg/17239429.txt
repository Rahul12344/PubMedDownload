BACKGROUND: Based on epidemiological data, infections with specific types of HPV 
can be classified as high-risk (HR), low-risk (LR) or intermediate-risk (IR) HPV 
depending on the risk of progression to cervical cancer.
CASE: A 70-year-old woman consulted for relapse of abnormal cytology with
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) associated with HPV-83
infection. Histological examination demonstrated high-grade cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with strong and diffuse staining by the
P16(INK4a)-specific antibody.
CONCLUSION: This patient's intermediate-risk HPV infection (HPV-83) rapidly
progressed to severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with strong
anti-P16(INK4a) immunolabelling. Analysis of the E6 peptide sequence revealed
several mutations in one of the two putative zinc finger regions (AA residues
107-135) associated with p53 binding.
