We have synthesized the peptide representing 135-159 VP1 sequence of A22 strain
of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The synthetic peptide induced 100%
protection of guinea pigs against the disease. Two-fold immunization of cuttle
with the peptide and single immunization of sheep induced full protection of the 
animals against A22 strain of FMDV.
