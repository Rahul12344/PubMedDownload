EBV-miR-BART1 has been found to be highly expressed in some cancers including
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but its exact roles in the pathogenesis of NPC
remain unclear. Here, we did RNA deep sequencing to compare the gene expression
profile between EBV-miR-BART1-expressing CNE1 cells and the control cells to
determine the possible effects of EBV-miR-BART1 in NPC. Gene expression profiling
analysis unexpectedly showed a significant number of up- and down-modulated
metabolism-associated genes, such as G6PD, SAT1, ASS1, PAST1, FUT1, SGPL1, DHRS3,
B4GALT1, PHGDH, IDH2, PISD, UGT8, LDHB and GALNT1, in EBV-miR-BART1-expressing
NPC cells, which were next confirmed by RT-qPCR. Moreover, of these
metabolism-genes, PSAT1 and PHGDH expression levels were significantly
upregulated and most of other genes were obviously up-expressed in NPC specimens 
compared with chronic nasopharyngitis (CNP) tissues. Collectively, we for the
first time found the effects of EBV-miR-BART1 on the expression of
mechanism-associated genes in NPC, suggesting a novel role of EBV-miR-BART1 in
cancer metabolism, which remains to be fully elucidated.
