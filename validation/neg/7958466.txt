NYVAC-based recombinants expressing pertinent immunogens from equine influenza
virus (EIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were used to evaluate the safety and
immunogenicity of this vector. Administration of either NYVAC recombinants or
parenteral virus to mice, horses and swine was well tolerated with no notable
local or systemic reactivities. Further, despite a highly attenuated phenotype,
NYVAC was found to function effectively as an immunization vehicle capable of
eliciting both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.
