We have recently shown that the artemisinin derivative artemisone, which was
screened against malaria in human clinical studies, is a potent inhibitor of
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here we evaluated the antiviral effect of
artemisone when employed in 2-drug combinations with approved and experimental
anti-HCMV agents. Using the Chou-Talalay method, we found that in-vitro
combination of artemisone with cidofovir, brincidofovir, or with the HCMV UL97
inhibitor maribavir resulted in antiviral synergism and the combination of
artemisone with ganciclovir or with the viral terminase inhibitors letermovir and
BDCRB resulted in moderate synergism. Importantly, the combination of artemisone 
with maribavir demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity ex-vivo, in a
clinically-relevant multicellular model of human placental tissues maintained in 
organ culture. Our findings provide the basis for the use of artemisone in
synergistically acting drug combinations, to enhance viral control and reduce
antiviral drug toxicities.
