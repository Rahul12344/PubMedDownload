Broad bean wilt virus Causes Necrotic Symptoms and Generates Defective RNAs in
Capsicum annuum.

ABSTRACT A virus was isolated from hot pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. Hyang Chon)
growing in Korea and displaying necrotic spots or streaks on leaves and stems
followed by stunting and death of plants. Morphological and host range analyses
of extracts from infected plants suggested that the causal agent of disease was a
Broad bean wilt virus (BBWV), and the virus was tentatively named a Korean
isolate of BBWV (BBWV-K). When the isolate was back-inoculated onto hot pepper
plants, it induced symptoms similar to those of naturally infected hot pepper in 
the field. Two coat proteins (CPs) of 44 and 22 kDa, corresponding to a large CP 
and a small CP, respectively, were identified from the virus, and both reacted
specifically with polyclonal antibody to BBWV 2. The complete nucleotide
sequences of RNA 1 and RNA 2 of the isolate were determined from cDNA clones. The
deduced amino acid sequence data from the putative proteins encoded by RNA 1 and 
2 of the BBWV-K indicated a closer relationship with the isolates of BBWV 2 than 
BBWV 1. However, sequence comparison of the 5' noncoding regions of the viruses
differentiates BBWV-K from other BBWV 2 isolates. Another distinctive feature of 
the BBWV-K is that it generates defective RNAs in hot pepper exhibiting necrotic 
symptoms, which is the first report of defective RNAs in the Fabavirus genera of 
BBWVs.
