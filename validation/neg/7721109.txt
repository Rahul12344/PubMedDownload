The complete nucleotide sequence (8031 bp) of the DNA of cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV) strain B29 is reported. This strain is unusual, since it infects both
cruciferous and solanaceous plants. So far, from data of sequence comparisons
between B29 and other CaMV strains there is no evidence for any obvious
correlation between host range and distinct sequence features.
