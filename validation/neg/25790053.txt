Indole derivatives inhibit hepatitis C virus replication through induction of
pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Lee S, Jin G, Kim D, Son S, Lee K, Lee C.

Previously, we discovered a series of indole derivatives as a new class of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication inhibitors by using a target-free chemical
genetic strategy. Through a structure-activity relationship study, the compound
12e was identified as the most potent inhibitor of this class (EC50 = 1.1 μmol/l)
with minimal cytotoxicity (CC50 = 61.8 μmol/l). In order to gain insight into its
detailed antiviral mechanism of action, we performed PCR array analyses and found
that 12e was able to activate transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory as
well as antiviral cytokine genes including CXCL-8, IL-1α, TNF-α, IL-3, IRAK-1,
and DDX58. Their induction by 12e was verified by individual RT-PCR analyses. In 
addition, 12e was found to stimulate secretion of soluble factors with anti-HCV
replication activity. Among the 12e-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, CXCL-8
showed a strong positive correlation between its transcriptional activation and
antiviral potency. Interestingly, a recombinant CXCL-8 protein also reduced HCV
replication, though only moderately. In conclusion, we found a novel mode of
action of indole derivatives in inhibiting HCV replication, particularly the
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
