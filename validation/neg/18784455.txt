OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of efavirenz
(EFV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in HIV-infected persons requiring
hemodialysis.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational study of HIV-infected hemodialysis patients
receiving one 600 mg tablet daily of EFV (N = 13) or three 133.3/33.3 mg capsules
twice daily of LPV/RTV (N = 13).
METHODS: Twenty-four-hour EFV and 12-h LPV/RTV pharmacokinetics were assessed.
Geometric mean ratios were calculated using historical controls with normal renal
function. The effects of several candidate gene polymorphisms were also explored.
RESULTS: The geometric mean [95% confidence interval (CI); percentage of
coefficient of variation (% CV)] Cmin, Cmax, and area under the curve (AUC) for
the EFV group were 1.81 microg/ml (0.93, 3.53; 103%), 5.04 microg/ml (3.48, 7.29;
72%), and 71.5 microg h/ml (43.2, 118.3; 93%), respectively. These parameters
were 2.76 microg/ml (1.86, 4.11; 53%), 8.45 microg/ml (6.41, 11.15; 52%), and
69.6 microg h/ml (55.6, 87.2; 37%) for LPV and 0.08 microg/ml (0.05, 0.14; 63%), 
0.58 microg/ml (0.44, 0.76; 41%), and 3.74 microg h/ml (2.91, 4.80; 37%) for RTV.
The AUC geometric mean ratios (90% CI) for EFV, LPV, and RTV were 132% (89, 197),
81% (67, 97), and 92% (76, 111), respectively. LPV Cmin was lower than expected
in the hemodialysis group. Higher EFV concentrations were associated with the
CYP2B6 516G>T polymorphism.
CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of EFV and LPV/RTV in hemodialysis suggests that
no dosing adjustments are necessary in treatment-naive patients. As HIV-infected 
hemodialysis patients are disproportionately black, the increased frequency of
the CYP2B6 516G>T polymorphism may lead to higher EFV levels. The potentially
lower LPV trough levels in this population suggest that LPV/RTV should be used
with caution in protease-inhibitor-experienced patients.
