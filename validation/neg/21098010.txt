Cryoglobulinaemia is a rare condition characterized by serum immunoglobulins or
immunocomplexes which precipitate at temperatures below 37 Â°C and redissolve on
warming. Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis develops in ~ 15% of patients positive for 
cryoglobulin serology and is often associated with an underlying infectious,
autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disease. We describe a case of
cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, which manifested as purpura and rapidly
deteriorating renal function in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and 
coexistent parvovirus infection. This case illustrates the complex
pathophysiology of cryoglobulinaemic renal injury, and suggests that infection
may serve as a trigger in the presence of other pathophysiological factors.
