A safe and effective direct acting anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agent is still
needed. In this study, human single chain variable fragments of antibody (scFvs) 
that bound to HCV NS3/4A protein were produced by phage display technology. The
engineered scFvs were linked to nonaarginines (R9) for making them cell
penetrable. HCV-RNA-transfected Huh7 cells treated with the transbodies produced 
from four different transformed E. coli clones had reduced HCV-RNA inside the
cells and in the cell spent media, as well as fewer HCV foci in the cell
monolayer compared to the transfected cells in culture medium alone. The
transbodies-treated transfected cells also had up-expression of the genes coding 
for the host innate immune response, including TRIF, TRAF3, IRF3, IL-28B, and
IFN-Î². Computerized homology modeling and intermolecular docking predicted that
the effective transbodies interacted with several critical residues of the NS3/4A
protease, including those that form catalytic triads, oxyanion loop, and S1 and
S6 pockets, as well as a zinc-binding site. Although insight into molecular
mechanisms of the transbodies need further laboratory investigation, it can be
deduced from the current data that the transbodies blocked the HCV NS3/4A
protease activities, leading to the HCV replication inhibition and restoration of
the virally suppressed host innate immunity. The engineered antibodies should be 
tested further for treatment of HCV infection either alone, in combination with
current therapeutics, or in a mixture with their cognates specific to other HCV
proteins.
