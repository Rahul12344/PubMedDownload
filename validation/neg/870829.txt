DNA sequences coding for the H2B histone of Psammechinus miliaris.

Birnstiel ML, Schaffner W, Smith HO.

Starting from restriction enzyme cleavage sites of known topologies the DNA
sequences coding for two thirds of the H2B histone protein, together with some 3 
inch extracistronic sequences, have been determined for the sea urchin
Psammechinus miliaris. This unambiguously identifies this gene and further
reveals its 5 inch-3inch polarity and accurate map position in a cloned histone
DNA repeat unit.
