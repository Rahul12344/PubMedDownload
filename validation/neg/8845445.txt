The past decade has witnessed a veritable explosion of interest in the simple
molecule nitric oxide (NO) as a vasodilator, neurotransmitter, and antimicrobial 
agent. NO and other reactive nitrogen intermediates exhibit cytostatic or
cytocidal activity against a remarkable breadth of pathogenic microorganisms.
Mammalian cells, including human cells, produce nitric oxide both constitutively 
and inducibly in response to inflammatory stimuli. This review will provide a
brief overview of current knowledge regarding the antimicrobial activity of NO
and the possible importance of this activity in infection, particularly with
regard to intracellular pathogens.
