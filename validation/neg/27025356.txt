Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with
lamivudine-monotherapy rapidly selects mutant variants in a high proportion of
individuals. Monitoring lamivudine resistance by consensus sequencing is costly
and insensitive for detection of minority variants. An oligonucleotide ligation
assay (OLA) for HBV lamivudine-resistance was developed and compared to consensus
sequencing. Both assays detected drug resistance mutations in 35/64 (54.7%)
specimens evaluated, and OLA detected minority mutants in an additional six
(9.4%). OLA may offer a sensitive and inexpensive alternative to consensus
sequencing for detection of HBV drug resistance in resource-limited settings.
