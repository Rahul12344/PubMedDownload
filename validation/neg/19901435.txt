Cervical cancer continues to be the commonest cause of death among women in
developing countries, largely due to the failure to the inability to sustain
effective cytology-based screening programs. While this burden may come down
following implementation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, screening
will still be required. HPV DNA testing is a promising new technology for
cervical cancer prevention and is the most reproducible of all cervical cancer
screening tests. Presently, the two assays most widely used for the detection of 
genital types are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Hybrid Capture 2 assays
(hc2). Rapid, affordable tests are expected to be available soon. HPV DNA testing
can be used in a variety of clinical scenarios that include primary screening in 
women older than 30 yr; as an adjunctive test to cytology; in the triage of women
with an equivocal cytologic report, e.g., ASC-US; or for follow-up post-treatment
for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPV DNA testing can also be
performed on self-collected samples, which allows screening in remote areas and
also in women who refuse gynecologic examination.
