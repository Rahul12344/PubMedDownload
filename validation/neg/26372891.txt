Evidence of high efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) from
randomized controlled trials is strong for children 2-6 years of age, but fewer
data exist for older school-age children. We reviewed the published data on
efficacy and effectiveness of LAIV in children â‰¥5 years. QUOSA (Elsevier
database) was searched for articles published from January 1990 to June 2014 that
included 'FluMist', 'LAIV', 'CAIV', 'cold adapted influenza vaccine', 'live
attenuated influenza vaccine', 'live attenuated cold adapted' or 'flu mist'.
Studies evaluated included randomized controlled trials, effectiveness and
indirect protection studies. This review demonstrates that LAIV has considerable 
efficacy and effectiveness in school-age children.
