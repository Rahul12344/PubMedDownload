BACKGROUND: There are accumulating documentation of autoimmune mediated
extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection. The virus is
hepatotrophic and lymphotrophic. It mutates frequently with subsequent inadequate
immune response and chronic stimulation of T and B cells. This may be one
explanation for the increased frequency of the autoimmune diseases associated
with hepatitis C virus infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review of the literature published in the period of
1990 to 2000, we present the most common extrahepatic manifestations of the
hepatitis C virus infection.
RESULTS: Mixed cryoglobulinaemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and
membranous glomerulonephritis are highly associated with hepatitis C infection.
Other autoimmune diseases may also be associated with hepatitis C infection, but 
further documentation is necessary.
INTERPRETATION: Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection are
associated with several autoimmune diseases. When diagnosing an autoimmune
disease, a test for a coinfection of hepatitis C is highly recommended. Antiviral
therapy with interferon may in some cases reduce the activity of the autoimmune
disease.
