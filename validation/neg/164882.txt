Studies of the viral flora in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

Willamson J, Doig WM, Forrester JV, Carson W, Whaley K.

Fifty patients suffering from KCS and exhibiting various patterns of corneal
staining with fluorescein were examined for adenovirus types 3, 7, 8, and 14,
herpes simplex, and the TRIC group by tissue culture and immunofluorescein
techniques. No viruses were detected by either methods, and it is considered that
presumption of virus involvement in these cases is untenable.
