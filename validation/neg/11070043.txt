Genomic RNA sorting between translation and packaging was examined for human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 using actinomycin D and
leptomycin B treatment. Both viruses behaved differently from a simple retrovirus
under actinomycin D treatment. With leptomycin B, the lack of apparent functional
separation between translation and packaging functions in lentiviruses was
confirmed. HIV-2 RNA levels were more stable, but reverse transcriptase
production declined similarly to HIV-1.
