Developmental control of gene expression has a major impact on the design of
beta-globin retrovirus vectors for hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of
beta-thalassemia. It is obvious that the endogenous locus control region (LCR)
elements that drive beta-globin gene expression in transgenic mice must be
included in these vectors. However, the specific elements to use are not clear
and require an understanding of LCR action. Moreover, retrovirus vectors contain 
silencer elements that function in stem cells and are dominant to LCR function.
Recent studies on LCRbeta-globin transgenes and retrovirus silencing suggest ways
to overcome this silencing effect after transfer into stem cells and carefully
designed lentivirus vectors have exciting therapeutic benefit in animal models of
beta-thalassemia. By building on 15 years of development, LCRbeta-globin vectors 
are now being tested in preclinical animal models and may ultimately lead to the 
long-sought cure for this genetic disease.
