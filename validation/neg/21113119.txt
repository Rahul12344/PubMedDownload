Intracranial injection of viral vectors engineered to express a fluorescent
protein is a versatile labeling technique for visualization of specific subsets
of cells in different brain regions both in vivo and in brain sections. Unlike
the injection of fluorescent dyes, viral labeling offers targeting of individual 
cell types and is less expensive and time consuming than establishing transgenic 
mouse lines. In this technique, an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector is
injected intracranially using stereotaxic coordinates, a micropipette and an
automated pump for precise delivery of AAV to the desired area with minimal
damage to the surrounding tissue. Injection parameters can be tailored to
individual experiments by adjusting the animal age at injection, injection
location, volume of injection, rate of injection, AAV serotype and the promoter
driving gene expression. Depending on the conditions chosen, virally-induced
transgene expression can allow visualization of groups of cells, individual cells
or fine cellular processes, down to the level of dendritic spines. The experiment
shown here depicts an injection of double-stranded AAV expressing green
fluorescent protein for the labeling of neurons and glia in the mouse primary
visual cortex.
