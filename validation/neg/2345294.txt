Serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were measured in children 
from Manduar and Keneba, two adjacent villages in The Gambia, in 1980 and in
1984. The rate of HBV infection over the 4 years differed markedly: in Manduar
71% of children who were less than 5 years of age in 1980 became infected,
whereas in Keneba only 37% became infected. Male children were more frequent
carriers of either HBs or e antigen than were female children. Marked clustering 
of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antigenemia within sibling relationships
was shown in both villages. The chance of the youngest child in a household being
a carrier of HBsAg was strongly related to the number of antigen-positive
siblings. Four years later, 53% of children who were initially positive for HBsAg
and 33% who were positive for hepatitis B e antigen still carried these antigens.
Jaundice was not observed.
