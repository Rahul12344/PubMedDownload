A 15-month-old boy treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid therapy for 8
days was admitted for persistent gastroenteritis and fever. He received
ceftriaxone for pneumonia modified on day 4 for cefotaxime and josamycin due to
extension of alveolar lesions. On day 7, persistent fever and worsened
respiratory distress led to addition of rifampicin. The child was then admitted
to an intensive care unit. A hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected based on
clinical signs and laboratory findings and confirmed by cytological examination
of bone marrow. Adenovirus type 7 was identified by polymerase chain reaction and
culture of bronchoalveolar fluid. Prognosis was good within 3 weeks. B and T
immunologic evaluations were normal 5 months after the infection. This case of
severe adenovirus pneumonia was associated with hemophagocytic syndrome in a
child without identified primary immunodeficiency. Adenovirus type 3 and 7 are
most frequently responsible for severe or fatal respiratory infections.
