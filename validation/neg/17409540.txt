Although both cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin or cis-DDP) and
trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) bind to DNA, only cis-DDP is widely used as a 
chemotherapeutic agent; the stereoisomer trans-DDP is inactive. DNA, generally,
is wound around the histone core in the nucleus of living cells and forms the
nucleosome structure. To understand the essentially different anticancer
activities of cis-DDP and trans-DDP, it is necessary to investigate the
interaction of cis-DDP (or trans-DDP) with DNA around the histone in the
nucleosome. Here, we used psiX174DNA-histone(LNCaP) complexes prepared by the
reaction of psiX174DNA with histone(LNCaP) extracted from LNCaP cells. We first
show that the ability of cis-DDP to dissociate the DNA from
psiX174DNA-histone(LNCaP), as a nucleosome model, is much stronger than that of
trans-DDP. As a result of the action of cis-DDP, the DNA in the nucleosome is
rendered naked, and the naked DNA is vulnerable to cis-DDP (or other drugs). This
study describes a new model showing that the difference in the activities of
cis-DDP and trans-DDP is related to the difference in their abilities to
dissociate the DNA from the nucleosome.
