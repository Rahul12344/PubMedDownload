Saliva functions to protect the oral cavity from pathogenic invasion by
modulating the ability of microbes to colonize the oral surfaces or limiting
their growth and/or viability. Although the role of salivary secretions in the
modulation of the oral bacteria flora has received considerable attention, little
is known concerning its role in viral pathogenesis. Accordingly, the purpose of
this study was to assess the effect of salivary secretions on herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication. Initially, HSV-1 plaque and titer reduction
assays were performed to determine the ability of human submandibular/sublingual 
(HSMSL) and parotid (HPS) salivas to inhibit the early stages of HSV-1 infection 
(adsorption and penetration). Our results suggested that both HSMSL and HPS
possess cell-protective and virus neutralization activities, with HSMSL being
more active than HPS. Additional experiments were performed to determine the
effect of saliva on the yield of virus progeny. Again, HSMSL caused a greater
reduction of HSV-1 replication than did HPS. A similar effect could not be
obtained using vaccinia, suggesting that this inhibitory activity of human saliva
is selective. Collectively, these results suggest that human salivary secretions 
can modulate the replication of HSV-1 in vitro.
