Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Unusual features of two patients from a
low-incidence area.

Temple JJ, Brammer MG, Andes WA, Covington S, Rangan S.

The occurrence of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma in two New Orleans patients, one
native-born, the other originally from Honduras, is reported. Both exhibited an
unusual feature. One patient was diagnosed following an atypical episode of
sinusitis and demonstrated lymphomatous infiltration of the nasopharynx. A second
patient had a fulminant course complicated by severe diarrhea and was found to
have both tumor involvement and cytomegalovirus inclusions in the colon. Both had
high titers of antibodies to HTLV-I. A cell line with T-lymphocyte
characteristics was established from the peripheral blood of the first patient.
Such studies may help better establish the clinical course, detection, and
epidemiologic features of this difficult disease.
