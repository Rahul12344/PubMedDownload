BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS)
Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload with serum
transferrin saturation (TS), ferritin, and C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE
gene.
METHODS: All C282Y homozygotes and participants with an increased TS (>45% women,
>50% men) and serum ferritin level (> 200 microg/L women, >300 microg/L men) were
recalled for a clinical history and physical examination, and blood tests
including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase levels. Hepatitis
B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus were measured if the ALT level was
increased (>31 IU/L in women, >40 IU/L in men).
RESULTS: In the group of participants selected to return for clinical examination
because of increased TS and ferritin levels, ALT increases and anti-hepatitis C
virus were found in 95 of 284 (33%) African Americans, 50 of 466 (11%) Asian and 
Pacific Islanders, 21 of 120 (18%) Hispanics, and 40 of 477 (8.4%) Caucasians.
ALT increases and hepatitis B surface antigen were detected in 24 of 466 (5%)
Asian and Pacific Islanders, 10 of 284 (3.5%) African Americans, 3 of 120 (2.5%) 
Hispanics, and 2 of 477 (.42%) Caucasians. Of 86 liver biopsy specimens obtained 
for clinical purposes, 53 were reviewed by a single study pathologist. Liver
fibrosis (stage 3 or 4) was present in 2 of 11 (18.2%) C282Y homozygotes that
underwent central review and 2 of 302 (.66%) C282Y homozygotes attending the
clinical examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for iron overload with ferritin and TS detects persons
with viral hepatitis and other types of liver disease. A minimum of .66% C282Y
homozygotes have liver fibrosis.
