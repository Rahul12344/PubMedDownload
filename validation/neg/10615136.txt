Chromosomal deletions, especially nested deletions, are major genetic tools in
diploid organisms that facilitate the functional analysis of large chromosomal
regions and allow the rapid localization of mutations to specific genetic
intervals. In mice, well-characterized overlapping deletions are only available
at a few chromosomal loci, partly due to drawbacks of existing methods. Here we
exploit the random integration of a retrovirus to generate high-resolution sets
of nested deletions around defined loci in embryonic stem (ES) cells, with sizes 
extending from a few kilobases to several megabases. This approach expands the
application of Cre-loxP-based chromosome engineering because it not only allows
the construction of hundreds of overlapping deletions, but also provides
molecular entry points to regions based on the retroviral tags. Our approach can 
be extended to any region of the mouse genome.
