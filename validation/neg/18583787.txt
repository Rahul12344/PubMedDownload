BACKGROUND: Low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are related to the
genesis of various benign lesions. In an isolated report available, HPVs have
been implicated in the causation of skin tags too.
AIMS: The present study was designed to detect the existence of low-risk HPV
types 6 and 11 in cutaneous soft fibromas (skin tag) in north Indians.
METHODS: A total of 37 cases of skin tags from various sites were analyzed.
Highly sensitive and comprehensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays were done for the
detection of low-risk HPV types 6 and 11.
RESULTS: The results revealed the presence of HPV DNA 6/11 in 48.6% of the skin
tags examined by PCR-RFLP.
CONCLUSION: This result corroborates the hypothesis that HPV plays a part in the 
etiology of benign lesions like cutaneous soft fibromas. The identification of
HPV 6/11 in these lesions, which are benign proliferations of the skin, further
expands the spectrum of HPV-linked lesions.
