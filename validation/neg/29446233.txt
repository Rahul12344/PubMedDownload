BACKGROUND: Estimates of influenza disease burden are broadly useful for public
health, helping national and local authorities monitor epidemiologic trends, plan
and allocate resources, and promote influenza vaccination. Historically,
estimates of the burden of seasonal influenza in the United States, focused
mainly on influenza-related mortality and hospitalization, were generated every
few years. Since the 2010-2011 influenza season, annual US influenza burden
estimates have been generated and expanded to include estimates of
influenza-related outpatient medical visits and symptomatic illness in the
community.
METHODS: We used routinely collected surveillance data, outbreak field
investigations, and proportions of people seeking health care from survey results
to estimate the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths
due to influenza during six influenza seasons (2010-2011 through 2015-2016).
RESULTS: We estimate that the number of influenza-related illnesses that have
occurred during influenza season has ranged from 9.2 million to 35.6 million,
including 140 000 to 710 000 influenza-related hospitalizations.
DISCUSSION: These annual efforts have strengthened public health communications
products and supported timely assessment of the impact of vaccination through
estimates of illness and hospitalizations averted. Additionally, annual estimates
of influenza burden have highlighted areas where disease surveillance needs
improvement to better support public health decision making for seasonal
influenza epidemics as well as future pandemics.
