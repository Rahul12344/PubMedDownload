The accessory recombination function (arf) gene of bacteriophage P22 is located
immediately upstream of the essential recombination function (erf) gene. Three
mutant alleles of arf were constructed and installed in P22 in place of the
wild-type allele: an out-of-frame internal deletion, an in-frame internal
deletion, and an amber mutation. The deletion mutant phages are partially
defective in homologous recombination and plaque formation in wild-type and recA 
hosts; their defects are more severe in recB and recA recB hosts. The amber
mutant phage exhibits the same growth phenotypes in nonsuppressing hosts, but not
in an amber-suppressor host. Plasmids that express arf complement the growth
defect of arf- phages. These plasmids stimulate erf-mediated recombination; they 
were also found to cause a small stimulation of recA-recBCD-mediated homologous
recombination of phage lambda.
