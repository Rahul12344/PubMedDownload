The capability of NK lymphocytes to kill tumor cells depends on different
receptors/ligands interactions. In order to identify the cellular ligands
recognized by "orphan" triggering receptors, mice were immunized with NK
susceptible target cells. mAbs were selected that inhibited NK cytotoxicity and
recognized two different molecules of 70 and 60-65 kDa. Tryptic digestion and
mass spectra analysis of purified proteins identified these molecules as PVR and 
Nectin-2, respectively. PVR-Fc and Nectin-2-Fc chimeric molecules stained COS-7
cells expressing the DNAM-1 activating receptor and conversely, PVR and Nectin-2 
CHO-K cell transfectants were stained by DNAM-1-Fc. Thus, both PVR and Nectin-2
represent specific ligands for DNAM-1. Importantly, the specific interaction
between DNAM-1 (in NK cells) and PVR or Nectin-2 (in target cells) enhanced the
NK-mediated lysis of tumor cells that was downregulated by mAb-mediated masking
of the receptor or its ligands.
