Recently it has been shown that dominant mutations in the human hepatocyte
nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene, encoding for a homeoprotein that is
expressed in liver, kidney, pancreas and intestine, result in maturity onset
diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). HNF1alpha-null mice are diabetic, but at
the same time suffer from a renal Fanconi syndrome characterized by urinary
glucose loss. Here we show that MODY3 patients are also characterized by a
reduced tubular reabsorption of glucose. The renal murine defect is due to
reduced expression of the low affinity/high capacity glucose cotransporter
(SGLT2). Our results show that HNF1alpha directly controls SGLT2 gene expression.
Together these data indicate that HNF1alpha plays a key role in glucose
homeostasis in mammals.
