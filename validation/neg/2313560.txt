From October 1985 to November 1987, a sample of 294 Colombian homosexual men
volunteered to answer a questionnaire on sexual practices and consented to HIV-1 
testing. Testing for HIV-1 was performed using an ELISA and those positive were
confirmed with envelope- and core-specific ELISAs. Statistical methods for data
analysis included Mantel-Haenszel methods on contingency tables. The overall
seropositivity rate was 21.1%. Subjects who reported a receptive role (either as 
predominantly receptive or as mixed receptive-insertive intercourse) had a
seropositivity rate of 23.7%, which was significantly higher than the 10.3% found
in those reporting predominantly insertive intercourse (RR = 2.30, 95% C.I. =
1.16-4.57). For subjects reporting receptive intercourse, sexual contact with
foreign visitors was a significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection (RR = 1.84,
95% C.I. = 1.13-3.00). Factors of borderline significance included having had
more than ten homosexual partners in the preceding year (RR = 1.53) and a history
of international travel (RR = 1.43). These associations did not hold for those
reporting predominantly insertive intercourse. The data indicate the need to
monitor the spread of HIV-1 at the international level and provide information on
subgroups of high transmission rates.
