Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common cause of acute icteric hepatitis in
adults. The vast majority of these patients resolve this acute infection and
develop long-lasting immunity. In contrast, the vast majority of patients who
develop chronic HBV have minimal symptoms and do not develop jaundice after
becoming infected with HBV. These patients will frequently remain undiagnosed for
years or decades. Approximately 1% of persons with acute HBV develop acute liver 
failure. Preventing acute HBV with vaccination is the best treatment. Although
universal vaccination is now administered to newborns in many countries, the
majority of adults have not been vaccinated and remain at risk. Because the
majority of patients with acute HBV resolve this infection spontaneously,
treatment with an oral anti-HBV agent is not necessary. However, the use of an
oral anti-HBV agent is not unreasonable to use in a patient who is developing
acute liver failure from severe acute HBV.
