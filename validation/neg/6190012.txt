Long terminal repeat enhancement of v-mos transforming activity: identification
of essential regions.

Wood TG, McGeady ML, Blair DG, Vande Woude GF.

The transforming efficiency of recombinant DNA clones containing the Moloney
sarcoma virus v-mos sequence was enhanced by introducing the Moloney sarcoma
virus long terminal repeat (LTR) in either the 5' or 3' position relative to
v-mos. We analyzed the polyadenylated RNA expressed in cells transformed by these
recombinant DNA clones and examined the structural integrity of integrated copies
of the DNA. In each case, we demonstrated the presence of v-mos containing RNA
transcripts in the polyadenylated RNA and showed that these RNA transcripts are
consistent with the structure of the transfected DNA. The analysis of DNA from
these transformed cells showed that the relative positions of the v-mos and LTR
sequences within the transfected DNA were conserved in the integrated DNA copies.
These results demonstrate that a single LTR can successfully enhance the
transforming activity of v-mos from either a 5' or a 3' relative position. The
results from the transfection analysis of recombinant clones containing only
portions of the LTR introduced 3' to v-mos demonstrate that the essential region 
of the LTR responsible for the enhancement of transformation is a region within
the unique 3' sequences of the LTR containing the 73-base-pair tandem repeat
sequence.
