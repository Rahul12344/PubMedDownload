BACKGROUND: BCG vaccination, combined with adenoviral-delivered boosts,
represents a reasonable strategy to augment, broaden and prolong immune
protection against tuberculosis (TB). We tested BCG (SSI1331) (in 6 animals,
delivered intradermally) and a recombinant (rBCG) AFRO-1 expressing
perfringolysin (in 6 animals) followed by two boosts (delivered intramuscullary) 
with non-replicating adenovirus 35 (rAd35) expressing a fusion protein composed
of Ag85A, Ag85B and TB10.4, for the capacity to induce antigen-specific cellular 
immune responses in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Control animals received
diluent (3 animals).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cellular immune responses were analyzed longitudinally (12 
blood draws for each animal) using intracellular cytokine staining (TNF-alpha,
IL-2 and IFN-gamma), T cell proliferation was measured in CD4(+),
CD8alpha/beta(+), and CD8alpha/alpha(+) T cell subsets and IFN-gamma production
was tested in 7 day PBMC cultures (whole blood cell assay, WBA) using Ag85A,
Ag85B, TB10.4 recombinant proteins, PPD or BCG as stimuli. Animals primed with
AFRO-1 showed i) increased Ag85B-specific IFN-gamma production in the WBA assay
(median >400 pg/ml for 6 animals) one week after the first boost with
adenoviral-delivered TB-antigens as compared to animals primed with BCG (<200
pg/ml), ii) stronger T cell proliferation in the CD8alpha/alpha(+) T cell subset 
(proliferative index 17%) as compared to BCG-primed animals (proliferative index 
5% in CD8alpha/alpha(+) T cells). Polyfunctional T cells, defined by IFN-gamma,
TNF-alpha and IL-2 production were detected in 2/6 animals primed with AFRO-1
directed against Ag85A/b and TB10.4; 4/6 animals primed with BCG showed a Ag85A/b
responses, yet only a single animal exhibited Ag85A/b and TB10.4 reactivity.
CONCLUSION: AFRO-1 induces qualitatively and quantitatively different cellular
immune responses as compared with BCG in rhesus macaques. Increased
IFN-gamma-responses and antigen-specific T cell proliferation in the
CD8alpha/alpha+ T cell subset represents a valuable marker for vaccine-take in
BCG-based TB vaccine trials.
