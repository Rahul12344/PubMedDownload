The search for the ideal influenza vaccine.

Davenport FM.

The history of the development of influenza virus vaccine is traced from its
origin with experimental studies of influenza virus in ferrets and mice and the
first trials in man. Knowledge of the basis of immunity to the viruses in
experimental animals and in man has grown steadily over the years and has been
essential to successful immunization. Virus variation affecting the surface
antigens of the virus is seen as the principal obstacle to the application of
vaccines in man. So significant are the changes occurring during antigenic drift 
that former concepts of a polyvalent vaccine cannot provide a solution of the
problem of the composition of vaccines. Disrupted virus vaccines appear to
provide the answer to the prevention of vaccine reactions.
