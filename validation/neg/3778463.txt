Proto-oncogene c-mos, the cellular homologue of the transforming gene of Moloney 
murine sarcoma virus, has been characterized by the lack of expression in a
variety of differentiated tissues, possibly because of the existence of an
inhibitory upstream sequence. We detected mos-related transcripts in
undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells of pluripotential cell line 311. The
sizes of three major transcripts detected were estimated to be 1.8, 4.6 and
6.1-kilobases (kb) by northern analysis. Furthermore, these transcriptions were
suppressed when the cell differentiation was induced by retinoic acid. Taken
together, the results suggest that mos product plays a role in early stages of
development.
