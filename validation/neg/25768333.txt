Glioblastoma, the most aggressive of the gliomas, has a high recurrence and
mortality rate. The nature of this poor prognosis resides in the molecular
heterogeneity and phenotypic features of this tumor. Despite research advances in
understanding the molecular biology, it has been difficult to translate this
knowledge into effective treatment. Nearly all will have tumor recurrence, yet to
date very few therapies have established efficacy as salvage regimens. This
challenge is further complicated by imaging confounders and to an even greater
degree by the ever increasing molecular heterogeneity that is thought to be both 
sporadic and treatment-induced. The development of novel clinical trial designs
to support the development and testing of novel treatment regimens and drug
delivery strategies underscore the need for more precise techniques in imaging
and better surrogate markers to help determine treatment response. This review
summarizes recent approaches to treat patients with recurrent glioblastoma and
considers future perspectives.
