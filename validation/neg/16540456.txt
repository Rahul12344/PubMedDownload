Over the past three decades, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
evolved from being a clinical rarity to become an important cause of neurological
complications in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Recently
this disease unexpectedly occurred in patients receiving the novel
immunomodulatory medication natalizumab. These changes in the epidemiology of PML
also brought new questions with regard to the pathogenesis of this disease. The
authors review the current challenges in the diagnosis and management of patients
with PML, based on the recent advances in the understanding of the JC virus
biology and discuss potential methods to monitor disease evolution and predict
outcome.
