Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes have been shown to inhibit the replication of
the ocular herpes virus. It is well known that these complexes have a high
affinity for nitrogenous donors such as histidine residues, and it is possible
that they bind to (and inhibit) an enzyme that is crucial to viral replication.
In model studies, we have found that [Co(acacen)(NH3)2]+ is an effective
irreversible inhibitor of thermolysin at millimolar concentrations; it also
inhibits human alpha-thrombin. Axial ligand exchange with an active-site
histidine is the proposed mechanism of inhibition. The activity of thermolysin
and thrombin can be protected by binding a reversible inhibitor to the active
site before addition of the cobalt(III) complex.
