Cycloheximide (CHX) inhibits protein synthesis in most eukaryotic cells and it is
a well-known tool commonly used in biochemical research. In this paper, the
antiviral spectrum of CHX against several DNA and RNA viruses have been
evaluated. CHX showed strong inhibitory activities against several RNA viruses
such as HIV-1, influenza viruses, coxsackie B virus, enterovirus (EV71) and
several DNA viruses such as HSV and HCMV. Especially the strong inhibitory
activities of CHX against coxsackie B virus and enterovirus caught our attention,
since effective drugs available in clinic are limited. The SAR of CHX derivatives
also has been discussed in the paper. The hydroxyl group at C-2' and carbonyl
group at C-2" of CHX are essential for its antiviral activity. And modification
to these groups results its derivatives' antiviral activities reduced or lost.
