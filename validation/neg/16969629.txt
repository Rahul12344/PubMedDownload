Zucchini yellow fleck virus (ZYFV, genus Potyvirus) infects cultivated or wild
cucurbits in the Mediterranean basin and occasionally causes severe damage in
crops. Biological and serological data tend to indicate that ZYFV is related to
other cucurbit-infecting potyviruses, mainly papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and
Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV). In order to establish unambiguously the 
taxonomic status of ZYFV, the sequence of the 3' part of the genome -
encompassing the CP coding region - of two ZYFV strains originating from Italy
and France was obtained and compared with other potyviruses. The results obtained
indicate that ZYFV belongs to a distinct potyvirus species, related to but
different from PRSV and MWMV.
