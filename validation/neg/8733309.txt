We studied the evolution of HIV-1 infection and immune response during six years 
in two twins born from an infected mother. The children had a continuous
progression of the infection, proved by CD4+ cell count, serum anti-HIV
antibodies, cultivable virus and proviral load. Now, both children are on
antiviral treatment. The analysis of serum antibodies showed a different immune
response in both children. One of them developed higher levels of antibodies
directed against viral proteins and synthetic peptides derived from their
aminoacid sequence. In this child, the amount of cultivable virus increased less 
than in his twin. Nucleotide sequencing of a part of viral genoma, showed that
the virus belonged to the B subtype, prevalent in America and Europe. The
observed differences in viral sequences suggest a different selective pressure in
both twins. This phenomenon could be related to the observed differences in
immune response.
