Proportions of T lymphocyte subsets (OKT3, OKT4, OKT8) and expression of
interleukin-2 (IL-2), transferrin (TFR) receptors and HLA-DR antigens were
studied in the peripheral blood of 21 healthy HBsAg carriers, 10 patients with
chronic active hepatitis B (CAH), 10 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis
(ALC) and 10 subjects with negative markers of previous hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection. T lymphocyte subsets ranged within normal levels in CAH and carriers, 
whereas a significant decrease of OKT4 was noted in ALC possibly involved in the 
pathogenesis of this disorder. Significantly elevated numbers of activated cells 
(cells expressing IL-2, TFR receptors and HLA-DR antigens) were observed in all
three groups. A significant increase in OKT8 cells within the TFR population was 
noted in CAH and ALC, whereas proportions of T subsets in the TFR population were
normal in carriers. These findings possibly suggest a common pathogenetic
mechanism in the activation of lymphocytes in CAH and ALC leading to liver damage
and an immune response against HBV in healthy carriers.
