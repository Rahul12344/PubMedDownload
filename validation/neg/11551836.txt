Newly developed hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA quantitative assays,
transcription-mediated amplification and hybridization protection assay (TMA-HPA)
and branched-DNA assay were clinically evaluated. The subjects consisted of 160
chronic HBV carriers; 48 were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)-positive, whereas 109 
were anti-HBe-positive (three were both negative). All subjects with HBeAg,
except one, showed high HBV-DNA replication levels (>/=10(5.8) copies/ml). In
HBeAg negative subjects, there was a strong correlation between the serum HBV-DNA
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; ALT level was usually normal if the
samples tested showed an HBV-DNA level less than 10(5)/ml, whereas, the majority 
of the sera with an HBV-DNA concentration greater than 10(7)copies/ml showed
elevation in serum ALT level. An intermediate range of HBV-DNA level (10(5)-10(7)
copies/ml) was associated with variable ALT activity. In conclusion, a serum
HBV-DNA level associated with ALT elevation was lower in patients with type B
chronic liver disease negative for HBeAg compared with their HBeAg-positive
counterparts. There was usually no or mild liver disease activity when patients
with chronic HBV infection have serum HBV-DNA levels less than 10(5)copies/ml.
