agammaglobulinemia.

We have established lymphoid cell lines with diversity of immunoglobulin
expression by infection of bone marrow cells of four patients with congenital
agammaglobulinemia with Epstein-Barr virus. Immunofluorescent study revealed that
the cells of many of these lymphoid cell lines had characteristics of possible
precursor B cells, permitting classification as follows: 1) cell lines without
any surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (17/28 lines), 2) cell lines which had
only cytoplasmic mu heavy chains (line K4 and O2), 3) cell lines with both mu and
delta heavy chains in the cytoplasm (line O6 and M5), 4) cell lines which bore
surface mu chains and possessed cytoplasmic mu chains but lacked light chain
expression (line S5), 5) cell lines which had surface and cytoplasmic delta and
lambda chains, and secreted the immunoglobulins (line K5), and 6) cell lines
which had surface IgM and cytoplasmic mu and light chains, and secreted the
immunoglobulins (5/28 lines). Biosynthetic studies with 14C-leucine confirmed the
patterns of immunoglobulin expression found by immunofluorescent analysis. These 
cell lines may represent some stages of B cell development and provide useful
information on the pathophysiology of congenital agammaglobulinemia.
