AIM: To describe the characteristics of people diagnosed with acute and chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in British Columbia (BC).
METHODS: We used data from the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC), which
includes all individuals tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or those diagnosed with HBV or active tuberculosis
in BC since 1990. These data were integrated with prescription drug, medical
visit, hospitalization and mortality data. HBV cases were classified as acute or 
chronic according to provincial guidelines. We compared characteristics of
individuals by HBV infection group (acute, chronic and negative). Factors
associated with acute or chronic HBV infection were assessed with multinomial
logistic regression models in comparison to the HBV negative group.
RESULTS: 46498 of the 1058056 eligible BC-HTC participants were diagnosed with
HBV infection. 4.3% of HBV positive individuals were diagnosed with acute HBV
infections while 95.7% had chronic infections. Problematic alcohol use, injection
drug use, and HIV or HCV co-infection were more common among individuals
diagnosed with acute HBV compared to those with chronic infections and HBV
negative individuals. In multivariable multinomial logistic regression models, we
observed significant associations between acute or chronic HBV diagnosis and
being male, age at HBV diagnosis or birth cohort, South and East Asian ethnicity,
HCV or HIV infection, and injection drug use. The odds of acute HBV decreased
with increasing age among people who inject drugs, while the opposite was true
for chronic HBV. Persons with acute HBV were predominantly White (78%) while
those with chronic HBV were mostly East Asian (60%). Relative to Whites, East
Asians had 12 times greater odds of being diagnosed with chronic HBV infection.
These odds increased with increasing socioeconomic deprivation.
CONCLUSION: Differences in the profiles of people diagnosed with acute and
chronic HBV infection necessitate differentiated screening, prevention, care and 
treatment programs.
