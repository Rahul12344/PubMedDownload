Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: investigation of three cases using in
situ hybridization with JC virus biotinylated DNA probe.

Aksamit AJ, Mourrain P, Sever JL, Major EO.

Using the technique of in situ DNA-to-DNA hybridization, a JC virus biotinylated 
DNA probe was developed and applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, or
fixed, frozen sections of brain tissue from three subjects with progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Light microscopy was carried out to
correlate the presence of JC virus DNA with the selective infection of
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in PML. Oligodendrocytes (lytically infected)
showed the greatest evidence of viral DNA. More astrocytes showing bizarre
morphological changes had evidence of viral DNA than did astrocytes that were
simply reactive. Viral DNA was not evident in vascular endothelial cells using
this technique. Viral DNA replication may be an important initial step which
produces the bizarre "transformed" astrocytes of PML. Findings in this study do
not support the hypothesis that vascular endothelial replication is important in 
the pathogenesis of JC virus-induced PML. In situ hybridization with biotinylated
JC virus probe may be useful in the diagnosis of PML on brain biopsy specimens.
