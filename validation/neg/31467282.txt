The innate response to a pathogen is critical in determining the outcome of the
infection. However, the interplay of different cellular responses that are
activated following viral infection and their contribution to innate antiviral
signalling has not been clearly established. This work shows that flaviviruses,
including Dengue, Zika, West Nile and Tick-borne encephalitis viruses, activate
the unfolded protein response before transcription of interferon regulatory
factor 3 induced genes. Infection in conditions of unfolded protein response
priming leads to early activation of innate antiviral responses and cell
intrinsic inhibition of viral replication, which is interferon regulatory factor 
3 dependent. These results demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is not 
only a physiological reaction of the cell to viral infection, but also synergizes
with pattern recognition sensing to mount a potent antiviral response.
