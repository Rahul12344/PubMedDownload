Periodontal health is defined by absence of clinically detectable inflammation.
There is a biological level of immune surveillance that is consistent with
clinical gingival health and homeostasis. Clinical gingival health may be found
in a periodontium that is intact, i.e. without clinical attachment loss or bone
loss, and on a reduced periodontium in either a non-periodontitis patient (e.g.
in patients with some form of gingival recession or following crown lengthening
surgery) or in a patient with a history of periodontitis who is currently
periodontally stable. Clinical gingival health can be restored following
treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis. However, the treated and stable
periodontitis patient with current gingival health remains at increased risk of
recurrent periodontitis, and accordingly, must be closely monitored. Two broad
categories of gingival diseases include non-dental plaque biofilm-induced
gingival diseases and dental plaque-induced gingivitis. Non-dental plaque
biofilm-induced gingival diseases include a variety of conditions that are not
caused by plaque and usually do not resolve following plaque removal. Such
lesions may be manifestations of a systemic condition or may be localized to the 
oral cavity. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis has a variety of clinical signs and
symptoms, and both local predisposing factors and systemic modifying factors can 
affect its extent, severity, and progression. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis
may arise on an intact periodontium or on a reduced periodontium in either a
non-periodontitis patient or in a currently stable "periodontitis patient" i.e.
successfully treated, in whom clinical inflammation has been eliminated (or
substantially reduced). A periodontitis patient with gingival inflammation
remains a periodontitis patient (Figure 1), and comprehensive risk assessment and
management are imperative to ensure early prevention and/or treatment of
recurrent/progressive periodontitis. Precision dental medicine defines a
patient-centered approach to care, and therefore, creates differences in the way 
in which a "case" of gingival health or gingivitis is defined for clinical
practice as opposed to epidemiologically in population prevalence surveys. Thus, 
case definitions of gingival health and gingivitis are presented for both
purposes. While gingival health and gingivitis have many clinical features, case 
definitions are primarily predicated on presence or absence of bleeding on
probing. Here we classify gingival health and gingival diseases/conditions, along
with a summary table of diagnostic features for defining health and gingivitis in
various clinical situations.
