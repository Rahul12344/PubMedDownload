Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators in the ecosystem
and also play a crucial economic role in the honey industry. During the last
decades, a continuous decay was registered in honey bee populations worldwide,
including Hungary. In our study, we used metagenomic approaches and conventional 
PCR screening on healthy and winter mortality affected colonies from multiple
sites in Hungary. The major goal was to discover presumed bee pathogens with
viral metagenomic experiments and gain prevalence and distribution data by
targeted PCR screening. We examined 664 honey bee samples that had been collected
during winter mortality from three seemingly healthy colonies and from one colony
infested heavily by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor in 2016 and 2017. The
subsequent PCR screening of honey bee samples revealed the abundant presence of
Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) for the first time in Central Europe.
Based on phylogeny reconstruction, the newly-detected virus was found to be most 
closely related to a Chinese AmFV strain. More sequence data from multiple
countries would be needed for studying the detailed phylogeographical patterns
and worldwide spreading process of AmFV. Here we report the prevalent presence of
this virus in Hungarian honey bee colonies.
