BACKGROUND: Duck enteritis virus (DEV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae and is
an important epornitic agent that causes economic losses in the waterfowl
industry. The Chinese virulent (CHv) and attenuate vaccines (VAC) are two
different pathogenic DEV strains. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding
RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infection. Nonetheless, there is
little information on virulent duck enteritis virus (DEV)-encoded miRNAs.
RESULTS: Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs
from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblasts cells. Compared with the reported 33
VAC-encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 "seed sequences" of miRNA were
identical, and 8 novel viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by stem-loop
RT-qPCR in this study. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, 38 CHv-encoded miRNAs
were predicted to target 41 viral genes and formed a complex regulatory network. 
Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that viral dev-miR-D8-3p can
directly target the 3'-UTR of CHv US1 gene (p < 0.05). Gene Ontology analysis on 
host target genes of viral miRNAs were mainly involved in biological regulation, 
cellular and metabolic processes. In addition, 598 novel duck-encoded miRNAs were
detected in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed significant differential 
expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were up-regulated, and 25 miRNAs were
down-regulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that CHv encoded a different set of microRNAs
and formed a unique regulatory network compared with VAC. This is the first
report of DEF miRNAs expression profile and an analysis of these miRNAs
regulatory mechanisms during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for
further exploring miRNA regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of DEV infection and
contribute to the understanding of the CHv-host interaction at the miRNA level.
