Singlet oxygen (1O2, 1delta(g)) selectively oxidizes many biological targets,
some of which, such as viruses, are located intracellularly under in vivo
conditions. Considering the short lifetime of 1O2 in aqueous media, it is
essential to generate this species in close proximity to the targets. Therefore, 
a water-soluble and non-ionic carrier of 1O2, DHPNO2, has been designed to convey
1O2 through lipid membranes. In contrast to the known anionic carrier NDPO2,
which inactivates only extracellular enveloped viruses, the new compound exhibits
virucidal activity on all types of viruses, enveloped (HIV) and non-enveloped
(Poliovirus), extracellular and intracellular. HIV inactivation can also be
achieved in the presence of red blood cells, suggesting the possible use of
DHPNO2 in the decontamination of cellular blood products.
