A total of 2,825 Japanese over 20 years of age living in the Yaeyama District of 
Okinawa, Japan were investigated in 1983 and 1984 to determine the prevalence and
risk factors of liver abnormalities. Obesity index, hepatitis B virus markers,
hepatitis C virus marker and serum transaminase were measured and the history of 
alcohol intake was recorded. People with elevated transaminase levels were
assumed to have abnormalities of the liver. The overall prevalence of liver
abnormalities was 3.6% and was significantly higher in men than in women (p <
0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the strongest predictors of
liver abnormalities were alcohol for the men and obesity for the women. Hepatitis
B virus was the second most prevalent risk factor in both sexes.
