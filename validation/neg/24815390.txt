Granzyme 3 (Gr3) is known as a tryptase-type member of the granzyme family and
exists in the granules of immunocompetent cells. Granule proteases including
granzymes, are transported into the cytoplasm of tumor cells or virus-infected
cells by perforin function, degrade cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins and
subsequently cause the death of the target cells. Recently, although several
substrates of Gr3 in vivo have been reported, these hydrolyzed sites were unclear
or lacked consistency. Our previous study investigated the optimal amino acid
triplet (P3-P2-P1) as a substrate for Gr3 using a limited combination of amino
acids at the P2 and P3 positions. In the present study, new fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate libraries to screen P2 and P3
positions were synthesized, respectively. Using these substrate libraries, the
optimal amino acid triplet was shown to be Tyr-Phe-Arg as a substrate for human
Gr3. Moreover, kinetic analyses also showed that the synthetic substrate
FRETS-YFR had the lowest Km value for human Gr3. A substantial number of membrane
proteins possessed the triplet Tyr-Phe-Arg and some of them might be in vivo
substrates for Gr3. The results might also be a great help for preparing specific
inhibitors to manipulate Gr3 activity both in vitro and in vivo.
