The bipartite begomoviruses (Geminiviridae family), which are DNA viruses that
replicate in the nucleus of infected cells, encode the nuclear shuttle protein
(NSP) to facilitate the translocation of viral DNA from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm via nuclear pores. This intracellular trafficking of NSP-DNA complexes 
is accessorized by the NSP-interacting guanosine triphosphatase (NIG) at the
cytosolic side. Here, we report the nuclear redistribution of NIG by AtWWP1, a WW
domain-containing protein that forms immune nuclear bodies (NBs) against
begomoviruses. We demonstrated that AtWWP1 relocates NIG from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus where it is confined to AtWWP1-NBs, suggesting that the NIG-AtWWP1
interaction may interfere with the NIG pro-viral function associated with its
cytosolic localization. Consistent with this assumption, loss of AtWWP1 function 
cuased plants more susceptible to begomovirus infection, whereas overexpression
of AtWWP1 enhanced plant resistance to begomovirus. Furthermore, we found that
a mutant version of AtWWP1 defective for NB formation was no longer capable of
interacting with and relocating NIG to the nucleus and lost its immune function
against begomovirus. The antiviral function of AtWWP1-NBs, however, could be
antagonized by viral infection that induced either the disruption or a decrease
in the number of AtWWP1-NBs. Collectively, these results led us to propose that
AtWWP1 organizes nuclear structures into nuclear foci, which provide intrinsic
immunity against begomovirus infection.
