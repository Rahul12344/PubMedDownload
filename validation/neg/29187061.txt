INTRODUCTION: Determination of the resting energy expenditure (REE) is essential 
for planning nutrition therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to help to improve their
nutrition status. We aim to evaluate the agreement and accuracy of prediction
equations that estimate the REE in a Mexican population with a diagnosis of
HIV/AIDS with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Mexican patients with HIV/AIDS with and
without ART. Weight, height, and body composition measured with dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry were evaluated. The REE was determined with indirect calorimetry
and estimated using the Mifflin-St Jeor (MSJ), Harris-Benedict (HB), Schofield 1 
and 2, Cunningham, Melchior 91, Melchior 93, and Batterham equations. The
Bland-Altman method assessed agreement between the real and estimated values, and
the percent difference between these values was used to assess the prediction
accuracy.
RESULTS: Sixty-five adults without ART and 102 adults with ART were included. The
mean REE (kcal/kg) was 24.8 ± 2.4 and 23.8 ± 3.6 in patients without and with
ART, respectively. Good agreement and reliability were observed in the HB
(intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.75; P < .05), Batterham (ICC, 0.79; 
P < .05), Schofield 1 (ICC, 0.74; P < .05), and Schofield 2 (ICC, 0.78; P < .05) 
results in individuals without ART. In individuals with ART, good agreement and
reliability were observed with the HB equation (ICC, 0.76; P < .05). The MSJ
equation showed good agreement with poor reliability (ICC, 0.05; P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The equations with the best agreement and accuracy were Schofield 2, 
Batterham, and HB in individuals without ART and HB and MSJ in the population
with ART.
