Two different cases of fatal Herpes simplex type 1 encephalitis are reported. A
presumptive diagnosis of herpes encephalitis was made on the basis of clinical
symptoms and of neurodiagnostic evidence (EEG - CT) and was confirmed by
serological and virological tests. The electron microscopy of the nuclei of the
infected cells supported the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis.
