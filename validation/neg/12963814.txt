We coinfected rhesus macaques with CXC chemokine receptor 4- and CC chemokine
receptor 5-specific simian/human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) to elucidate
the basis for the early dominance of R5-tropic strains seen in HIV-infected
humans. We found no intrinsic barrier to the transmission and dissemination of
high-dose X4-SHIV in the dually infected macaques. In animals that maintained a
viral set point, the R5 virus predominated. The time of appearance of R5
dominance coincided with the development of virus-specific immunity (3-6 weeks
postinfection), suggestive of differential immune control of the two viruses.
Indeed, after depletion of CD8+ T cells in the coinfected animals, X4 virus
emerged, supporting the concept that differential CD8+ T cell-mediated immune
control of X4- and R5-SHIV replication is responsible for the selective outgrowth
of R5 viruses. These findings provide critical insights into a key question
related to HIV pathogenesis and have important implications for the development
and testing of antiviral vaccines and therapeutics.
