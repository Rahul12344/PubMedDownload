To study enteropathogens, 100 fecal samples were collected from a Brazilian human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive population, with or without diarrhea.
Giardia lamblia and calicivirus were significantly associated with diarrhea as
were severe immunosuppression and the presence of at least one enteropathogen. No
sample was positive for rotavirus and only one asymptomatic individual carried
the astrovirus. We concluded that there is a great diversity of pathogens and
opportunistic infections in the studied population, with a high prevalence of
mixed colonization/infection. Our findings pave the way for future molecular
studies related to the expression of virulence factors and to the possibility of 
pathogen-pathogen interactions, especially between G. lamblia and calicivirus.
These findings are relevant to the improvement of therapies and controlling
diarrhea in the HIV-seropositive population.
