Gene mutations have been implicated in the etiology of cancer, developmental
anomalies, genetic disease and aging. Many different methods for mutation
detection have been developed and applied to obtain a more fundamental insight in
the chain of molecular events that ultimately lead to mutations. Most of these
methods, however, can only be applied to cultured cells and therefore do not
allow comparative analysis of mutations in various organs and tissues in an
intact organism. The main difficulty in studying mutagenesis in chromosomal DNA
is to identify and isolate mutated genes with a high efficiency. Here we describe
the development and application of LacZ transgenic mouse models for studying, in 
different organs and tissues, spontaneous or induced mutations. Such models allow
study of the induction of DNA damage, repair, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in
one animal system. Accordingly, results obtained may ultimately provide greater
insight into the chain of events from in vivo exposure to genotoxic agents to
mutations and their ultimate physiological endpoints. In addition to their use in
fundamental research, transgenic animal mutation models find a major application 
in the field of genetic toxicology testing, in particular with respect to organ
specificity.
