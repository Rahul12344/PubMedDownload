Using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination, we established a highly efficient and
reproducible system that generates autonomous HPV-18 genomes in primary human
keratinocytes (PHKs), the organotypic raft cultures of which recapitulated a
robust productive program. While E7 promoted S-phase re-entry in numerous
suprabasal differentiated cells, HPV DNA unexpectedly amplified following a
prolonged G2 arrest in mid- and upper spinous cells. As viral DNA levels
intensified, E7 activity diminished and then extinguished. These cells then
exited the cell cycle to undergo virion morphogenesis. High titers of progeny
virus generated an indistinguishable productive infection in na√Øve PHK raft
cultures as before, never before achieved until now. An immortalization-defective
HPV-18 E6 mutant genome was also characterized for the first time. Numerous cells
accumulated p53 protein, without inducing apoptosis, but the productive program
was severely curtailed. Complementation of mutant genomes by E6-expressing
retrovirus restored proper degradation of p53 as well as viral DNA amplification 
and L1 production. This system will be invaluable for HPV genetic dissection and 
serves as a faithful ex vivo model for investigating infections and
interventions.
