The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of simple and
microencapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotic with or without inulin
as prebiotic on meat quality of broiler infected by avian influenza virus (H9N2).
Two hundred-day-old chicks were randomly allocated into 14 groups based on
simple, microencapsulated probiotic and prebiotic and based on vaccination and
challenge with H9N2 virus. Groups 1-7 contained 20 chicks, and groups 8-12 and 14
contained 10 chicks. Group 13 was derived from group 1 with 10 chicks at
challenge day with avian influenza virus (AIV). Half of the groups were
vaccinated by H9N2 vaccine on day 5. All groups except the negative control and
positive vaccine control were challenged with 106.5 EID50 of low-virulence H9N2
AIV at day 21. Each bird was received 109 CFU of simple or microencapsulated
probiotic on days 0 and 17 by gavage. Prebiotic as dose as 0.1Â % of feed weight
was used daily. Increase in water-holding capacity, dry matter, ash and protein
content, and decrease in dripping loss plus beneficial changes in lightness and
redness of breast meat were detected in response to probiotic especially
microencapsulated synbiotic. In conclusion, probiotic alone or with prebiotic was
able to improve the physicochemical properties of chicken breast muscle in both
healthy and AIV-infected chickens.
