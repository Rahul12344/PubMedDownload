The modes of evolution of the proteins of Potato virus Y were investigated with a
maximum-likelihood method based on estimation of the ratio between non-synonymous
and synonymous substitution rates. Evidence for diversifying selection was
obtained for the 6K2 protein (one amino acid position) and coat protein (24 amino
acid positions). Amino acid sites in the coat proteins of other potyviruses (Bean
yellow mosaic virus, Yam mosaic virus) were also found to be under diversifying
selection. Most of the sites belonged to the N-terminal domain, which is exposed 
to the exterior of the virion particle. Several of these amino acid positions in 
the coat proteins were shared between some of these three potyviruses.
Identification of diversifying selection events in these different proteins will 
help to unravel their biological functions and is essential to an understanding
of the evolutionary constraints exerted on the potyvirus genome. The hypothesis
of a link between evolutionary constraints due to host plants and occurrence of
diversifying selection is discussed.
