Many biological processes result in either cell death or cessation of cell
growth. However, plasmid- and retrovirus-based mammalian expression vectors in
which it has been possible to construct representative cDNA libraries cannot be
readily recovered from cells that are not actively dividing. This has limited the
efficiency of selection of recombinant genes that mediate either lytic events or 
growth arrest. Examples include genes that encode the target antigens of
cytotoxic T cells, genes that promote stem-cell differentiation and pro-apoptotic
genes. We have successfully constructed representative cDNA libraries in a
poxvirus-based vector that can be recovered from cells that have undergone
lethality-based selection. This strategy has been applied to selection of a gene 
that encodes a cytotoxic T-cell target antigen common to several independently
derived tumors.
