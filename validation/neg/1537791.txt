Escherichia coli genes were cloned onto a multicopy plasmid and selected by the
ability to restore growth and protein export defects caused by a
temperature-sensitive secY or secA mutation. When secA51 was used as the primary 
mutation, only clones carrying groE, which specifies the chaperonin class of heat
shock protein, were obtained. Selection using secY24 yielded three major classes 
of genes. The first class encodes another heat shock protein, HtpG; the most
frequently obtained second class encodes a neutral histonelike protein, H-NS; and
the third class, msyB, encodes a 124-residue protein of which 38 residues are
acidic amino acids. Possible mechanisms of suppression as well as the
significance and limitations of the multicopy suppression approach are discussed.
