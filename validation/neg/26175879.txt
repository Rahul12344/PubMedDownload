are known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between 
the seasonal effect and other risk factors on the incidence of herpes zoster.
METHODS: The medical records of 1,105 patients admitted to the outpatient
diagnosed with herpes zoster were retrospectively examined. The patients' sex,
age, dermatome, onset, underlying disease, residential areas were collected.
RESULTS: The incidence of women outnumbered men and increased for those above the
age of 50. The number of occurrences of herpes zoster patients was higher in the 
spring and summer than in winter. Unlike men, women had the most frequent
outbreaks in March. The most common occurrence of dermatome is in the thoracic
region. The number of occurrence was similar on the left as the right.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, herpes zoster occurs more often in women than in men
