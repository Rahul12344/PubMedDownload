AIM: To investigate the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of 
bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).
METHODS: Seventy eight paraffin wax embedded TCC samples were tested for the
presence of HPV by two methods. First, immunohistochemistry was carried out using
a polyclonal antibody capable of detecting the capsid protein of all known
papillomaviruses. The second method was a consensus GP5+/6+ primer mediated
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, with the products analysed by both
agarose gel electrophoresis and an enzyme immunoassay using type specific
oligonucleotide probes for 10 different mucosal genotypes. To exclude false
negative results because of the poor quality of DNA extracted from paraffin wax
embedded samples, the series was extended to include 20 further blocks for which 
the corresponding snap frozen unfixed tissue was available.
RESULTS: The two methods produced contrasting results, with 47 of the 78 samples 
positive for HPV antigen and none positive for HPV DNA. HPV DNA was not detected 
in the 20 additional paraffin wax embedded TCCs or in the 20 paired unfixed
samples. In contrast, HPV DNA was amplified by PCR from all six of the paraffin
wax embedded cervical carcinoma and anogenital wart control samples.
CONCLUSION: The disparity between the two sets of results is probably caused by
false positives resulting from the non-specificity of the polyclonal antibody
used for immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that HPV is unlikely to play
an aetiological role in the development of bladder TCC.
