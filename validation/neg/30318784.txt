BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) vIL-6 is 
sufficient to induce lymphatic reprogramming of vascular endothelial cells, which
is a key event in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) development. This study was aimed to
investigate the effect of Chinese herb oroxylin A on lymphatic reprogramming and 
neovascularization by KSHV vIL-6 in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The lymphatic-phenotype endothelial cell line was generated by
lentiviral KSHV vIL-6 infection. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by 
MTT assay or flow cytometry with annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Migration, 
invasion, and neovascularization of the vIL-6-expressing lymphatic-phenotype
endothelial cells were determined by wound healing assay, transwell chamber
assay, microtubule formation assay, and chick chorioallantoic membrane assay,
respectively. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis
were used to test the expression of Prox1, VEGFR3, podoplanin, LYVE-1, and PPARγ 
in cells. Co-localization of Prox1 and PPARγ was determined by
immunofluorescence. Ubiquitination of Prox1 was detected by in vivo
ubiquitination assay.
RESULTS: The lymphatic-phenotype endothelial cell line expressing KSHV vIL-6 was 
successfully generated. Oroxylin A induced cellular invasion abrogation,
apoptosis induction, and neovascularization inhibition of the vIL-6-expressing
endothelial cells. Mechanically, oroxylin A elevated PPARγ expression, which in
turn interacted with and facilitated Prox1 to undergo ubiquitinational
degradation, and subsequently leads to VEGFR3, LYVE-1, and podoplanin reduction.
CONCLUSION: Through modulating PPARγ/Prox1 axis, oroxylin A inhibits lymphatic
reprogramming and neovascularization of KSHV vIL-6. Thus, oroxylin A may serve as
a candidate for the treatment of KS as well as other aggressive angiomas.
