A 49 year old man who developed idiopathic pulmonary haemorrhage and
glomerulonephritis responded initially to immunosuppressive treatment and
plasmapheresis. However, he died later from massive pulmonary haemorrhage and
necropsy showed cytomegalovirus infection of the lungs. We propose that relapse
of pulmonary haemorrhage may be associated with cytomegalovirus infection and
that preventive measures against acquiring the virus through blood products
should be considered for elective transfusions in view of the relatively good
long term prognosis of this syndrome.
