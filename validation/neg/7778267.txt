We were able to isolate high-affinity RNAs from a random pool that binds to
integrase protein from the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 using the
procedure now known as SELEX. Generally, the RNAs fell into three different
classes in binding buffer containing 250 mM NaCl: group I class of molecules
binds integrase with a dissociation constant (Kd) on the order of 10 nM, group II
molecules had a Kd of about 80 nM, and group III about 800 nM. The RNA with the
highest affinity from the group I class of molecules, designated P5, was
characterized using computer modeling, chemical and enzymatic probing, and
deletion analysis. Our secondary structure model for this RNA suggests
interactions between looped-out fixed nucleotides and nucleotides from the
randomized region; a GNRA tetraloop is also in the structure. We showed that our 
integrase was able to process a U5 mimic in vitro. P5 competes effectively for
binding with the double-stranded DNA mimic of U5 at 180 mM NaCl concentration.
