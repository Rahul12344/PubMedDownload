Infections are estimated to cause approximately 15% of the world's cancers with
large geographic variations. Yet, Canadian estimates for specific cancer-causing 
infections are not available. To estimate the number of infection-associated
cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015, we calculated population
attributable risks (PARs) and the number of attributable cases for seven
carcinogenic infections and their 20 associated cancers. A systematic literature 
search was performed for each infection to obtain data on infection prevalence in
the population and the relative risk or odds ratio associated with the cancer it 
causes. When mechanistic evidence suggested that detection of a given infection
within cancer tissue was sufficient to attribute the cancer to the infection,
prevalence among cancer cases was used to approximate the PAR. Data from 61
studies formed the basis of our analyses. The estimated number of
infection-attributable cancer cases for 2015 was: 3828 for human papillomavirus
(HPV), 2052 for Helicobacter pylori, 578 for Epstein-Barr virus, 509 for
hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), 100 for human herpesvirus type 8, and 30
cases for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. These seven infections were
responsible for 3.7% of cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015; 3.5%
among men and 4.0% among women. The infections with the highest number of
attributable cases are largely preventable or treatable through vaccination (HBV 
and HPV), antibiotic therapy (H. pylori), or a combination of interventions
(HCV), thereby representing an important target for reducing the infection-caused
cancer burden among Canadians.
