Health disparities experienced by black or African Americans--United States.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In the 2000 census, 36.4 million persons, approximately 12.9% of the U.S.
population, identified themselves as Black or African American; 35.4 million of
these persons identified themselves as non-Hispanic. For many health conditions, 
non-Hispanic blacks bear a disproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and
disability. Although the top three causes and seven of the 10 leading causes of
death are the same for non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (the largest
racial/ethnic population in the United States), the risk factors and incidence,
morbidity, and mortality rates for these diseases and injuries often are greater 
among blacks than whites. In addition, three of the 10 leading causes of death
for non-Hispanic blacks are not among the leading causes of death for
non-Hispanic whites: homicide (sixth), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease
(seventh), and septicemia (ninth). This week's MMWR is the third in a series
focusing on racial/ethnic health disparities. Eliminating these disparities will 
require culturally appropriate public health initiatives, community support, and 
equitable access to quality health care.
