We present a patient with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, in whom significant
regression of hepatic fibrosis was achieved after a lengthy antiviral treatment. 
A liver biopsy specimen obtained at initiation of treatment showed chronic
hepatitis B with mild activity (histologic activity index: 7) and marked fibrosis
(stage 4, in a scale of 0 to 6). A second biopsy specimen, obtained 10 years
later, demonstrated almost complete resolution of necroinflammatory activity and 
fibrosis. One year after the second biopsy, seroconversion from HBsAg positive to
anti-HBs positive status was achieved, and antiviral treatment was discontinued. 
This case is illustrative of the significant histologic improvement that can be
accomplished in chronic hepatitis B when viral activity is suppressed long term. 
Lengthy antiviral treatment can achieve resorption of excess fibrous tissue, even
in patients with marked fibrosis.
