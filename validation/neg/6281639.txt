We analyzed data from a 14-year longitudinal study of respiratory infections in
young children to determine the relative importance of viral respiratory
infection and nasopharyngeal colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Haemophilus influenzae as factors influencing the occurrence of acute otitis
media with effusion. The incidence of this disorder was increased in children
with viral respiratory infections (average relative risk, 3.2; P less than
0.0001). Infection with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus (type A or
B), and adenovirus conferred a greater risk of otitis media than did infection
with parainfluenza virus, enterovirus, or rhinovirus. Colonization of the
nasopharynx with Str. pneumoniae or H. influenzae had a lesser effect on the
incidence of the disease (average relative risk; 1.5; P less than 0.01).
Infections with the viruses more closely associated with acute otitis media
(respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and influenza A or B) were correlated
with an increased risk of recurrent disease. Prevention of selected
otitis-associated viral infections should reduce the incidence of this disease.
