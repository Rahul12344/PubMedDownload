The finding of an increased risk of HIV-infected individuals for contracting
pneumococcal diseases has led to the recommendation of antipneumococcal
vaccination of HIV-infected individuals. However, due to reports of increased
viral replication following immune stimulation, the vaccination policy has been
called into question. The literature on changes in viral load and CD4 T cells
following vaccination and the studies on the clinical efficacy of
antipneumococcal vaccination is evaluated. It is concluded that the prevailing
data do not lend support to the concern of a lasting effect of vaccination on
viral load. Data on the clinical efficacy and serological responses of
vaccination are too scanty to support the recommendation of antipneumococcal
vaccination to HIV-infected individuals. In addition to the issue of clinical
efficacy; many question remain to be addressed; for example, the protective
antibody level, optimal timing and vaccination regimen are yet to be determined.
