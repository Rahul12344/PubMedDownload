Manipulation of programmed cell death (PCD) is central to many host microbe
interactions. Both plant and animal cells use PCD as a powerful weapon against
biotrophic pathogens, including viruses, which draw their nutrition from living
tissue. Thus, diverse biotrophic pathogens have evolved many mechanisms to
suppress programmed cell death, and mutualistic and commensal microbes may employ
similar mechanisms. Necrotrophic pathogens derive their nutrition from dead
tissue, and many produce toxins specifically to trigger programmed cell death in 
their hosts. Hemibiotrophic pathogens manipulate PCD in a most exquisite way,
suppressing PCD during the biotrophic phase and stimulating it during the
necrotrophic phase. This mini-review will summarize the mechanisms that have
evolved in diverse microbes and hosts for controlling PCD and the Gene Ontology
terms developed by the Plant-Associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO) Consortium 
for describing those mechanisms.
