BACKGROUND: Maternity waiting homes (MWHs) are used to increase the number of
women delivering at health care facilities. The first MWHs in Liberia were opened
in 2012, prior to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak.
METHODS: Longitudinal data were collected from registries on MWH use, antenatal
care, postnatal care and facility deliveries from 2012 to 2016 to assess MWH
utilization.
RESULTS: All indicators examined declined during the EVD outbreak, but within 6
months of the cessation of the outbreak they returned to pre-EVD levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest MWH utilization remained stable after international
funding ceased and EV affected the region.
