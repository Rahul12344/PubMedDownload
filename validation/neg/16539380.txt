The antiproliferative activity of the 14 isomeric monoxylosylated
dihydroxynaphthalenes has been tested in vitro toward normal HFL-1 and 3T3 A31
cells as well as transformed T24 and 3T3 SV40 cells. The antiproliferative effect
toward HFL-1 cells was correlated with the polarity of the compounds. However, in
the case of transformed T24 cells, some compounds showed a clearly different
behavior resulting in a selective antiproliferative effect. No such correlation
was found for normal 3T3 A31 or virus transformed 3T3 SV40 cells, nor for the
free aglycon. These results suggest that the antiproliferative activity shown by 
naphthoxylosides is diverse in different cell lines and dependent on the nature
of the aglycon. The antiproliferative effect of
2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)-beta-D-xylopyranoside, in contrast to inactive
2-naphthyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, on T24 cells was accompanied by increased
apoptosis as indicated by a TUNEL assay.
