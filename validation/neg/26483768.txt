Previous imported cases of Lassa fever (LF) into the United Kingdom from the
Ivory Coast and Mali, as well as the detection of Lassa virus (LASV) among the
Mastomys natalensis population within Mali has led to the suggestion that the
endemic area for LF is expanding. Initial phylogenetic analyses arrange isolates 
from Mali and the Ivory Coast separately from the classical lineage IV isolates
taken from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. The availability of full genome
sequences continues to increase, allowing for a more complete phylogenetic
comparison of the isolates from Mali and the Ivory Coast to the other existing
isolates. In this study, we utilized a Bayesian approach to infer the demographic
histories of each LASV isolate for which the full sequence was available. Our
results indicate that the isolates from Mali and the Ivory Coast group separately
from the isolates of lineage IV, comprising a distinct fifth lineage. The split
between lineages IV and V is estimated to have occurred around 200-300 years ago,
which coincides with the colonial period of West Africa.
