Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are expressed on human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cells and incorporated into the lipid
envelope of HIV virions. Macaques immunized with human MHC gene products are
protected from simian immunodeficiency virus challenge when the virus is grown in
cells expressing the same MHC alleles. To relate these findings to
mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1, investigations of whether sharing HLA
between mother and infant influenced the risk of transmission of HIV-1 to the
child were carried out. Class I HLA concordance was independently associated with
a stepwise increase in the risk of perinatal HIV-1 transmission for each
additional concordant allele (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval,
1.36-5.07; P = .003). Thus, discordant HLA may provide infants with a means of
protection against HIV-1 as a result of allogeneic infant anti-maternal MHC
immune responses.
