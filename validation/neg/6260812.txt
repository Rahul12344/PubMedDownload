(Oryctolagus cuniculus).

Four young strain III/J rabbits of both sexes were inoculated with a single dose 
of prototype partially purified Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) via IV and IM routes.
All inoculated animals had enlarged lymph nodes, and significant levels of
antibodies to HVS early, late, and membrane antigens were detectable during the
infection. The animals died or were killed and HVS was isolated from the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the various lymph nodes but not from the
kidney. Microscopic examination showed that these animals had poorly
differentiated lymphomas. The response of mononuclear cells to PHA from
peripheral blood of infected animals showed depressed cell mediated immune
responses. Humoral and cellular immunity responses during tumorigenesis were
comparable to those reported in nonhuman primates with HVS-induced tumors. Thus, 
the inbred strain III/J appears to be an inexpensive suitable model for studies
of oncogenic herpesvirus-induced cancers.
