Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome disease (PRRS), a disease that has a
significant and economic impact on the swine industry. In this study,
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers with high specificity and affinity against
VR-2332 strain of PRRSV type II were successfully obtained. Of 19 candidates, the
LB32 aptamer was found to be the most specific and sensitive to VR-2332 strain
according to an aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The
detection of VR-2332 of PRRSV type II was successfully accomplished using the
enzyme-linked antibody-aptamer sandwich (ELAAS) method. The detection limit of
ELAAS was 4.8 Ã— 10(0) TCID(50)/mL that is comparable to some of the previous
reports of the PCR-based detection but does not require any complicated equipment
or extra costs. Moreover, this ELAAS-based PRRSV detection showed similar
sensitivity for both the VR-2332 samples spiked in diluted swine serum and in
buffer. Therefore, this VR-2332 strain-specific aptamer and its assay method with
high specificity can be used as an alternative method for the fast and precise
detection of PRRSV.
