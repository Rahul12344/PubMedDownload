BACKGROUND: A mass vaccination has been implemented to prevent the spread of 2009
pandemic influenza virus in China. Highly limited information is available on
whether this vaccine induces cross-reactive neutralization antibodies against
other subtypes of influenza viruses.
METHODS: We employed pseudovirus-based assays to analyze heterosubtypic
neutralization responses in serum samples of 23 recipients of 2009 pandemic
influenza vaccine.
RESULTS: One dose of pandemic vaccine not only stimulated good neutralization
antibodies against cognate influenza virus 2009 influenza A (H1N1), but also
raised broad cross-reactive neutralization activities against seasonal H3N2 and
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and lesser to H2N2. The
cross-reactive neutralization activities were completely abolished after the
removal of immunoglobin G (IgG). In contrast, H1N1 vaccination alone in
influenza-naive mice elicited only vigorous homologous neutralizing activities
but not cross-reactive neutralization activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the cross-reactive neutralization epitopes do 
exist in this vaccine and could elicit significant cross-reactive neutralizing
IgG antibodies in the presence of preexisting responses. The exposure to H1N1
vaccine is likely to modify the hierarchical order of preexisting immune
responses to influenza viruses. These findings provide insights into the
evolution of human immunity to influenza viruses after experiencing multiple
influenza virus infections and vaccinations.
