BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) visits provide an opportunity for hepatitis
C virus (HCV) screening for patients who otherwise might not be tested. We report
on a novel nontargeted, opt-out HCV screening and linkage-to-care (LTC) program
implemented in an urban ED.
METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis from 3 months (November 2016-January
2017) of a nontargeted, opt-out ED HCV screening and LTC program among patients
at least 13 years old undergoing phlebotomy for clinical purposes. A multipurpose
best practice advisory (BPA) alerted providers to the program and generated order
labels. For patients who authorized testing, specimens were drawn in the ED for
HCV antibody (Ab) and reflex confirmatory RNA tests. Public health navigators
attempted to contact RNA-positive patients and arrange outpatient visits.
RESULTS: HCV Ab tests were performed on 3,808 patients, a 6,950% increase from
preprogram. The proportion of HCV Ab test positivity was 13.2% (504/3,808, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 12.2%-14.3%) and of those 97.8% (493/504) had a
follow-up RNA test performed. A total of 292 were confirmed positive for active
infection, for an overall RNA positivity rate of 7.7% (95% CI = 6.8%-8.5%). Of
those with active infection, 155 (53%) were outside the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention birth cohort for increased risk for HCV including 46
(15.8%, 95% CI = 11.8%-20.4%) who also did not report injection drug use. Linkage
attempts were documented on 223 (76.4%) patients and appointments were scheduled 
for 102 (38% of attempted). Sixty-six patients attended their LTC visit (22.5% of
all RNA-positive patients, 30% of linkage-eligible patients).
CONCLUSIONS: Nontargeted opt-out HCV testing can be successfully implemented in
an ED setting. A number of patients diagnosed were outside traditional risk
groups. Once diagnosed, an ED population may be difficult to engage in care, but 
a structured interdisciplinary program can successfully link patients to HCV
care.
