Isolation of infectious bronchitis virus from intestine and reproductive organs
of laying hens with dropped egg production.

Maiti NK, Sharma SN, Sambyal DS.

A total of 52 samples (22 cloacal swabs and 30 pooled ovaries and oviducts) from 
hens with a history of a 25 to 40% drop in egg production from 30 flocks were
examined for the isolation of infectious bronchitis virus in embryonated chicken 
eggs. Five isolates were obtained: three from cloacal swabs and two from
reproductive organs. These isolates were identified and characterized on the
basis of agar-gel-precipitation, hemagglutination, and neutralization tests and
other physicochemical characteristics.
