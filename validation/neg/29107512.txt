Zika virus (ZIKV) has evolved from an overlooked mosquito-borne flavivirus into a
global health threat due to its astonishing causal link to microcephaly and other
disorders. ZIKV has been shown to infect neuronal progenitor cells of the fetal
mouse brain, which is comparable to the first-trimester human fetal brain, and
result in microcephaly. However, whether there are different effects between the 
contemporary ZIKV strain and its ancestral strain in the neonatal mouse brain,
which is comparable with the second-trimester human fetal brain, is unclear. Here
we adopted a mouse model which enables us to study the postnatal effect of ZIKV
infection. We show that even 100 pfu of ZIKV can replicate and infect neurons and
oligodendrocytes in most parts of the brain. Compared with the ancestral strain
from Cambodia (CAM/2010), infection of the ZIKV strain from Venezuela (VEN/2016) 
leads to much more severe microcephaly, accompanied by more neuronal cell death, 
abolishment of oligodendrocyte development, and a more dramatic immune response. 
The serious brain damage caused by VEN/2016 infection would be helpful to
elucidate why the American strain resulted in severe neurovirulence in infants
and will provide clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of infection
by different ZIKV strains.
