This study examines crack cocaine (crack) use, readiness to change, and gender in
a sample of 923 men and women randomized to standard human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) education (standard intervention [SI]) or peer-delivered intervention
(enhanced intervention [EI]). Four levels of crack use characterized frequency of
use in the past 30 days; readiness was assessed on three levels
(precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation/action). Differences between
intervention groups on crack use and readiness by gender were examined from
baseline to 3-month follow-up. Overall, participants reduced their crack use from
baseline, with those in the EI showing greater improvement than those in the SI. 
A small proportion of participants improved readiness; those who improved were
more likely to improve their crack use. No significant gender differences were
found. These findings suggest that the readiness construct does not fully capture
the dynamics of change among out-of-treatment crack users. Further research is
needed to fully comprehend the dynamics of change among this group.
