BACKGROUND: To monitor carrier hosts of avian influenza in Nigeria, we randomly
collected cloaca swab specimens from 155 ducks at a live bird market (LBM) in
Ibadan, southwest Nigeria, between July 2011 and July 2012.
METHODS: The samples were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation was carried out in embryonated
chicken eggs. Partial sequencing of the antigenic cleavage site of the
haemagglutinin (HA) gene was performed, multiple sequence alignment was carried
out using ClustalW, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor
joining method.
RESULTS: Twenty (13%) of the 155 samples were positive for avian influenza
subtype H5N2 by real-time RT-PCR and three isolates were obtained from
embryonated chicken eggs. Partial sequencing of the amino acid cleavage site of
the HA genes of two isolates corresponded to a PQRETGL*F sequence that is common 
in low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). Phylogenetically, the HA genes of the
two influenza viruses are monophyletic and clustered with H5N2 viruses detected
in wild ducks from Africa.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of LPAI in domestic ducks in Nigeria underscores the
importance of continuous surveillance and monitoring of the virus (in a country
that is considered to be free of avian influenza) in order to prevent the
emergence of virulent strains that may spread to commercial poultry and humans.
