SV40 antigen was detected in 7 of 13 malignant tumors developed in the head and
neck region. Specific complement fixing antibodies were found in all the patients
with the SV40 antigen present in the parotid gland tumoral cells. Incidence of
the anti-SV40 complement fixing antibodies in parotid gland tumor bearing
patients was of 69.6%.
