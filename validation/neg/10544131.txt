The putative, 3'-terminal stem-loop structure in satellite tobacco necrosis virus
strain C (STNV-C) RNA constitutes an essential cis-acting structure for the
promotion of negative-strand RNA synthesis and a single-stranded tail is also
important. The putative, 5'-terminal stem-loop structure in STNV-C RNA is not
essential for productive, plus-strand RNA accumulation but is required for
optimal accumulation. Residues 2 and 3 are the minimal cis-acting sequences
required for RNA synthesis. The RNA of chimeric mutants, which exchanged 3'- and 
5'-untranslated regions between STNV-C and helper tobacco necrosis virus strain D
RNAs, accumulated in protoplasts, implying similar replication mechanisms for
both RNAs.
