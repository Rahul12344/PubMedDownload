OBJECTIVE: IL-18 is a pluripotent cytokine that has been implicated in the
development of rheumatoid arthritis. A soluble form of the IL-18 receptor
accessory protein (sIL-18Rbeta) with unknown function has recently been
identified. This study examined the ability of sIL-18Rbeta to inhibit IL-18
biological activities and to modulate immune responses during collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: Adenoviruses encoding sIL-18Rbeta were administered intravenously in
type II collagen-immunised DBA/1 mice. Humoral responses were analysed by
determining anti-bovine collagen type II (BCII) antibody levels by ELISA.
Cytokine production by splenic T cells and cytokine levels in serum were measured
by Luminex multi-analyte technology. CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells
(Treg) were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Intravenous delivery of Ad5.sIL-18Rbeta in collagen-immunised mice led
to enhanced transgene expression in splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC). A
co-culture of these sIL-18Rbeta-transduced APC with purified splenic CD3(+) T
cells led to a marked inhibition of IL-18-induced IFNgamma, IL-4 and IL-17
production by CD3(+) T cells. Remarkably, systemic treatment with Ad5.sIL-18Rbeta
caused an exacerbation of arthritis, and histological evaluation of knee joints
showed increased cartilage and bone erosion. No significant differences were
observed in anti-BCII antibodies, but the aggravation was accompanied by
decreased IFNgamma (-30%) and IL-4 (-44%) and increased IL-17 (+84%) production
by splenic CD3(+) T cells. In addition, reduced circulating levels of
CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg and anti-inflammatory IL-10 were shown.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies sIL-18Rbeta as a novel IL-18 inhibitor, which
promotes CIA after intravenous overexpression by affecting Treg levels and
supporting a T helper type 17 response.
