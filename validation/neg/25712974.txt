BACKGROUND: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) remains a leading pathogen for acute infectious
diseases in children, especially in Asia. The cellular basis for establishing a
virus-specific antibody response to acute EV71 infections is unclear in children.
METHODS: We studied the magnitude of virus-specific antibody-secreting B cells
(ASCs) and its relationship with serological response, clinical parameters, and
virological parameters among children with laboratory-confirmed EV71 infection.
RESULTS: A potent EV71 genogroup B- and virus-specific ASC response was detected 
in the first week of illness among genotype B5 EV71-infected children. The
cross-reactive EV71-specific ASC response to genogroup C viral antigens composed 
about 10% of the response. The EV71-specific ASC response in children aged ≥3
years produced immunoglobulin G predominantly, but immunoglobulin M was
predominant in younger children. Proliferation marker was expressed by the
majority of circulating ASCs in the acute phase of EV71 infection. Virus-specific
ASC responses significantly correlated with throat viral load, fever duration,
and serological genogroup-specific neutralization titer.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a virus-specific ASC response serves an early
cellular marker of an EV71-specific antibody response. Further detailed study of 
EV71-specific ASCs at the monoclonal level is crucial to delineate the
specificity and function of antibody immunity in children.
