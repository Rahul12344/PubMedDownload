Co-infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in a threefold increase
in relative risk of progression to end stage liver disease and cirrhosis compared
to HCV alone. Although curative treatments exist, less than one quarter of people
with HCV are linked to care, and even fewer have received treatment. The
Care2Cure study is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to improve the
HCV care continuum among people co-infected with HIV. This ongoing study was
designed to test whether a nurse case management intervention can (i) improve
linkage to HCV care and (ii) decrease time to HCV treatment initiation among 70
adults co-infected with HIV who are not engaged in HCV care. The intervention is 
informed by the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use and consists of 
nurse-initiated referral, strengths-based education, patient navigation,
appointment reminders, and care coordination for drug-drug interactions in the
setting of HIV primary care. Validated instruments are used to measure
participant characteristics including HCV knowledge, substance use, and
depression. The primary outcome is linkage to HCV care (yes/no) within 60 days.
In this protocol paper, we describe the first clinical trial to examine the
effects of a nurse case management intervention to improve the HCV care continuum
among people co-infected with HIV/HCV in the era of all-oral HCV treatment. We
describe our work in progress, challenges encountered, and strategies to engage
this hard-to-reach population.
