We use data from the serial passage of co-occluded recombinant Autographa
californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) to estimate the viral
multiplicity of infection of cells within infected insects. Co-occlusion, the
incorporation of wild-type and mutant virus genomes in the same occlusion body,
has been proposed as a strategy to deliver genetically modified viruses as
insecticides in a way that contains their spread in the environment. It may also 
serve as a means whereby naturally occurring mutant forms of NPVs can be
maintained in a stable polymorphism. Here, a recombinant strain of AcMNPV was
constructed with a deletion of its polyhedrin gene, rendering it incapable of
producing occlusion bodies (i.e., occlusion negative). This was co-occluded with 
wild-type AcMNPV and used to infect fifth-instar Trichoplusia ni larvae. The fate
of both genotypes was monitored over several rounds of insect infection. Levels
of the occlusion-negative virus genome declined slowly over successive rounds of 
infection. We applied these data to a model of NPV population genetics to derive 
an estimate of 4.3 +/- 0.3 viral genomes per occlusion body-producing cell.
