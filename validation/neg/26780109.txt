BACKGROUND: Ganciclovir has demonstrated immunosuppressive effects in vitro which
may lead to delayed cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific immune reconstitution when the
drug is given prophylactically. Maribavir is a new and more potent anti-CMV drug 
that is under evaluation for therapeutic use in transplant recipients.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of
maribavir on CMV-specific T cell function in comparison to ganciclovir.
STUDY DESIGN: In ten immunocompetent CMV seropositive donors, maribavir and
ganciclovir were compared over a broad range of concentrations (0.2-500μM)
regarding their effects on lymphoproliferation, CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+
cytokine expression, T cell multifunctionality, degranulation and apoptosis.
RESULTS: Maribavir inhibited lymphocyte proliferation at concentrations of 50μM
and above, however, cytokine expression, cellular degranulation and
multifunctionality of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to CMV lysate and pp65
peptide mix were not impaired except at the highest concentration of 500μM.
Ganciclovir inhibited lymphoproliferative responses starting at 10μM. As with
maribavir, other cellular responses following stimulation with CMV lysate and
pp65 peptide mix were only impaired at the highest concentration of 500μM of
ganciclovir. Neither maribavir nor ganciclovir showed induction of lymphocyte
apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Maribavir exhibits a low potential to suppress CMV-specific T cell
function. This finding supports the use of higher doses in the prophylactic
setting than originally proposed.
