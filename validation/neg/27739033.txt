Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a neurotropic virus, has been used to deliver
heterologous genes into cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we constructed
a reporter SFV4-FL-EGFP and found that it can deliver EGFP into neurons located
at the injection site without disseminating throughout the brain. Lacking of the 
capsid gene of SFV4-FL-EGFP does not block its life cycle, while forming
replication-competent virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs hold subviral
genome by using the packaging sequence (PS) located within the nsP2 gene, and can
transfer their genome into cells. In addition, we found that the G protein of
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) can package SFV subviral genome, which is
consistent with the previous reports. The G protein of rabies virus (RVG) could
also package SFV subviral genome. These pseudo-typed SFV can deliver EGFP gene
into neurons. Taken together, these findings may be used to construct various
SFV-based delivery systems for virological studies, gene therapy, and neural
circuit labeling.
