BACKGROUND: Syphilis incidence has increased dramatically in the United States
since 2000, occurring primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM) and
disproportionately affecting those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. The continued increases in syphilis rates among MSM signals the need
for enhanced prevention methods. We undertook a study to examine the rate of
repeat syphilis infection among MSM in San Francisco and to identify risk factors
associated with syphilis reinfection that may inform additional prevention
strategies.
METHODS: We developed a retrospective cohort of all cases of primary, secondary, 
and early latent syphilis among MSM diagnosed in San Francisco in 2001 and 2002. 
We evaluated data through the end of 2003 to determine all cases of syphilis
reinfection, defined as a new infection that occurred within 1 year after prior
syphilis infection and treatment.
RESULTS: We found that 6.7% (42/624) of cases had a repeat syphilis infection
within 1 year. HIV infection was associated with an increased risk of repeat
infection (OR = 4.7; CI, 1.8-12.0). No differences in age, race, number of period
sex partners, illicit substance use, or partner meeting venues were observed
between cases with and without repeat infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that HIV-infected MSM with syphilis represent an 
at-risk group for repeat syphilis infection. Targeting increased screening and
risk reduction interventions to HIV-infected MSM in care could reduce the overall
incidence of syphilis among MSM.
