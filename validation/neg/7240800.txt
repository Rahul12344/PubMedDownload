Three standard hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) methods were compared with 11
commercially available diagnostic test kits for determination of immunity and
serologic diagnosis of rubella using a panel of 100 sera. The three standard HAI 
methods involved removal of serum inhibitors with kaolin, heparin-MnCl2, or
dextran sulfate-CaCl2. The HAI kaolin (Flow Laboratories, McLean, Virginia) and
Rubelisa (Microbiological Associates Bioproducts, Walkersville, Maryland) kits
gave the best specificity as judged by the absence of false-positive results.
Rubacell (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois), Rubindex (Ortho Diagnostics,
Raritan, New Jersey), Fiax (International Diagnostic Technology, Santa Clara,
California), and Rubesure (Calbiochem-Behring, La Jolla, California) gave the
best sensitivity as judged by the absence of false-negative results. The kits
with the highest degree of both specificity and sensitivity were HAI kaolin
(Flow), HAI heparin-MnCl2 (Flow), Rubacell (Abbott), and Rubindex (Ortho). In
paired sera from five patients with clinical rubella, seroconversions were shown 
by seven of the kits. One of the kits, Cordia R (Cordis Laboratories, Miami,
Florida), showed no significant rise in antibody titer with one pair of sera.
Antibody titers in the same serum varied widely between the different kits.
