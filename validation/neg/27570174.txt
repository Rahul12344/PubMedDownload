It is proposed that human immunodeficiency lentivirus particles (HIV) are of
ancient origin and have existed at a low level for centuries. The recent increase
in the extent and effects of this lentivirus have occurred principally from
change in the saccharide component of the human diet. This increased greatly the 
supply of oxalic acid required to produce the uracil component of lentivirus RN.
