OBJECTIVES: The authors studied the epidemiological, clinical, and outcome
features of the Ebola virus disease in patients hospitalized at the Ebola
treatment center (ETC) in Conakry to identify clinical factors associated with
death.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from March 25 to August 
20, 2014. The diagnosis of Ebola virus infection was made on real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Ninety patients, with a positive test result, were hospitalized. Their
mean age was 34.12±14.29 years and 63% were male patients. Most worked in the
informal sector (38%) and in the medical and paramedical staff (physicians 12%,
nurses 6%, and laboratory technicians 1%). Most patients lived in the Conakry
suburbs (74%) and in Boffa (11%). The main clinical signs were physical asthenia 
(80%) and fever (72%). Hemorrhagic signs were observed in 26% of patients. The
comparison of clinical manifestations showed that hiccups (P=0.04), respiratory
distress (P=0.04), and hemorrhagic symptoms (P=0.01) were more frequent among
patients who died. Malaria (72%) and diabetes (2%) were the most frequent
co-morbidities. The crude case fatality rate was 44% [95% confidence interval
(33-54%)]. The average hospital stay was 7.96±5.81 days.
CONCLUSION: The first Ebola outbreak in Conakry was characterized by the young
age of patients, discrete hemorrhagic signs related to lethality. Its control
relies on a strict use of preventive measures.
