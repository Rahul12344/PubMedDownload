An epidemiological cross sectional study of Schistosoma mansoni was conducted in 
two hyper endemic fishing villages of Rhino Camp and Obongi both in West Nile
district in northern Uganda in 1991 and 1992. People with various water contacts 
were registered. A small group of civil servants and clergies with less water
contact in the river Nile were studied for control of infection and morbidity. An
overall prevalence of 81.5% of the 1367 people studied in both fishing villages
of Rhino Camp and Obongi were excreting from 100 to > or = 500 Schistosoma
mansoni eggs per gram (epg). 253 18.5% did not have Schistosoma mansoni eggs in
their faeces. The influence of socioeconomic factors on infections in the study
population was high among poorer illiterates who have frequent water contacts
activities with River Nile. The sonomorphological abnormalities of periportal
thickening (PT) due to Schistosoma mansoni were performed using ultrasound. 664
patients were found to have various stages of (PT stages 0, I, II and III). A
total of 703 (51.4%) patients did not have any periportal thickening (PT 0) in
their livers despite the fact that 450 (32.9%) of them had Schistosoma. mansoni
eggs in their faeces. The gravities of schistosomiasis in the two villages were
similar showing greater morbidity in the younger adults.
