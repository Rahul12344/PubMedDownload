BACKGROUND: Adenoviral constructs have been used for studies of injury-induced
vascular hyperplasia in immunologically naive laboratory animals, but their
usefulness for intra-arterial gene therapy may be limited by the prevalence of
preexisting immunity to adenovirus in the patient population. Here, we explored
the efficacy of adenovirus-mediated transfer of Fas ligand, a cytotoxic gene with
immunomodulatory properties, in inhibiting injury-induced vascular lesion
formation in both naive and immunologically primed animals.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Lesion formation was evaluated in balloon-injured carotid
arteries of naive and adenovirus-immunized rats that were infected with
adenoviral constructs expressing Fas ligand (Ad-FasL), the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21 (Ad-p21), or beta-galactosidase (Ad-betagal). In naive rats,
Ad-FasL induced apoptosis in medial vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibited
intimal hyperplasia by 60% relative to Ad-betagal-treated vessels (P<0.05),
whereas the cytostatic agent Ad-p21 decreased lesion size by 58% (P<0.05). In
animals preimmunized with an adenoviral vector containing no transgene, Ad-FasL
significantly inhibited neointima formation (73% reduction, P<0.05), but Ad-p21
failed to inhibit neointima formation relative to controls. Immunologically
primed rats displayed robust T-cell infiltration in Ad-p21- and
Ad-betagal-treated vessels, but T-cell infiltration was markedly attenuated in
Ad-FasL-treated vessels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated Fas ligand delivery
can inhibit intimal hyperplasia in both immunologically primed and naive animals,
whereas the efficacy of an adenovirus-mediated p21 delivery is limited to
immunologically naive animals. This study documents, for the first time, the
therapeutic efficacy of intravascular adenoviral gene transfer in animals with
preexisting immunity to adenovirus.
