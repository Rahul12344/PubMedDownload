Background: The proportion of undiagnosed hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in
high-risk populations, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men
who have sex with men (MSM) is unclear. Identification of potential HCV
transmitters is important to reach World Health Organization HCV elimination
targets.
Methods: Between October 2015 and May 2016, we performed a systematic HCV
RNA-based screening among HIV-infected MSM participating in the Swiss HIV Cohort 
Study (SHCS). HCV antibodies were measured from all HCV RNA-positive samples.
Results: Of 4257 MSM recorded in the SHCS database, we screened 3722 (87%) by HCV
polymerase chain reaction, and 177 (4.8%) harbored a replicating HCV infection.
We identified 24 individuals (14%) with incident HCV infection; one-third of them
had a negative HCV antibody result at the time of HCV RNA positivity. In a
multivariable model, elevated liver enzyme values (odds ratio, 14.52; 95%
confidence interval, 9.92-21.26), unprotected sex with occasional partners (2.01;
1.36-2.98), intravenous drug use (7.13; 4.36-11.64), noninjectable drug use
(1.94; 1.3-2.88), and previous syphilis diagnosis (2.56; 1.74-3.76) were
associated with HCV RNA positivity.
Conclusions: A systematic HCV RNA-based screening among HIV-infected MSM revealed
a high number of potential transmitters. A substantial subpopulation of MSM had
incident infection, one-third of whom had a negative HCV antibody test result at 
the time of the HCV RNA positivity. These data reveal that one-time RNA testing
of a high-risk population for HCV RNA might identify more infected persons than
routine testing for HCV antibodies and liver enzymes.
