Although lung epithelial cells directly attach to the basement membrane
underneath in vivo, harvested epithelial cells are typically cultured on type I
collagen gel (Col I-gel) in vitro. Recently we developed new culture substratum, 
designated as "synthesized Basement Membrane" (sBM), that has bared lamina densa 
on fibrillar collagen. To validate the usefulness of sBM substratum in airway
tissue reconstitution in vitro, we cultured rat tracheal epithelial cells on sBM 
substratum and Col I-gel. When starting the air-liquid interface culture, most of
the epithelial cells were squamous and positive for the basal cell marker
cytokeratin 14 (CK14). After 14 days on sBM substratum, CK14-positive cells
differentiated not only to Clara and mucous cells, but also to ciliated cells.
Those differentiated cells formed pseudostratified-like epithelium and the
remaining CK14-positive cells were polarized to the basal side. However, on Col
I-gel, the CK14-positive cells were still squamous and not polarized, and
ciliated cells did not appear. In conclusion, we established a new culture model 
on sBM substratum in which basal cells could differentiate to ciliated cells. The
application of sBM substratum is useful in the study of the airway epithelial
cell differentiation in vitro.
