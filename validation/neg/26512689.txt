Since 2010, the variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been the
etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED)
worldwide. In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN1 was isolated, serially
propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better
elucidate the molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains, we
sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN1 and
passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200. The results showed that the variations
increased with the viral passage. The nucleotides sequences of non-structural
protein (NSP)2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes did not change during the
Vero cell adaptation process. After comparison of the variation characteristic of
classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of 
PEDV virus was associated with 9-26 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading
frames (ORF) 1a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF3, 1-3 aa changes in E, 
M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences' synonymous mutations. The aa
deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the
PEDV. The pig study showed that the early termination in ORF3 was more important 
for virus cell adaptation than virus attenuation.
