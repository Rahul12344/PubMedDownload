Further evidence for papovavirus as the probable etiology of transmissible
lymphoma of Syrian hamsters.

Barthold SW, Bhatt PN, Johnson EA.

The role of hamster papovavirus as the etiology of transmissible lymphoma was
investigated under strict conditions that prevented natural exposure to the
lymphoma agent. In an initial experiment, 19 hamsters that were exposed naturally
to transmissible lymphoma were placed in direct and indirect contact with
weanling hamsters from an uninfected source. Lymphoma developed in the original
infected hamsters as well as hamsters maintained in direct and indirect contact. 
In addition, one of the contact hamsters developed cutaneous epitheliomas,
containing hamster papovavirus. Epithelioma homogenate was inoculated into
primary hamster embryo cultures, in which hamster papovavirus replicated. Second 
and third passage tissue culture fluid containing hamster papovavirus induced
lymphomas in suckling and weanling hamsters. Cell culture fluid from uninoculated
embryo cultures was not oncogenic.
