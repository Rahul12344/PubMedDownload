OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of TCE in human immuno-deficiency
virus positive patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficacy of Tinospora cordifolia extract (TCE) in HIV
positive patients was assessed in randomized double blind placebo controlled
trial. 68 HIV positive participants were randomly assigned to two groups to
receive either TCE or placebo for six months. After clinical examination TLC,
DLC, ESR, platelet count, hemoglobin and CD4 count were done. The hematological
investigations were repeated at bimonthly intervals and CD4 count was repeated at
the end of the study. Patients were clinically reviewed at monthly intervals for 
compliance, refill and ADR monitoring. The drugs were decoded at the end of the
trial.
RESULTS: TCE treatment caused significant reduction in eosinophil count and
hemoglobin percentage. 60% patients receiving TCE and 20% on placebo reported
decrease in the incidence of various symptoms associated with disease. Some of
the common complaints reported by patients on TCE were anorexia, nausea, vomiting
and weakness.
CONCLUSION: Tinospora cordifolia extract, a plant derived immunostimulant,
significantly affected the symptoms of HIV. This was validated by clinical
evaluation. However not all of the objective parameters studied by us, back this 
up. Tinospora cordifolia could be used as an adjunct to HIV/AIDS management.
