OBJECTIVE: To determine whether genogroup 1 porcine torque teno virus (g1-TTV)
can potentiate clinical disease associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).
SAMPLE POPULATION: 33 gnotobiotic baby pigs.
PROCEDURES: Pigs were allocated into 7 groups: group A, 5 uninoculated control
pigs from 3 litters; group B, 4 pigs oronasally inoculated with PCV2 alone; group
C, 4 pigs inoculated IP with first-passage g1-TTV alone; group D, 4 pigs
inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV alone; group E, 6 pigs inoculated IP
with first-passage g1-TTV and then oronasally inoculated with PCV2 7 days later; 
group F, 6 pigs inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV and then inoculated
oronasally with PCV2 7 days later; and group G, 4 pigs inoculated oro-nasally
with PCV2 and then inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV 7 days later.
RESULTS: 6 of 12 pigs inoculated with g1-TTV prior to PCV2 developed acute onset 
of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). None of the pigs inoculated
with g1-TTV alone or PCV2 alone or that were challenge exposed to g1-TTV after
establishment of infection with PCV2 developed clinical illness. Uninoculated
control pigs remained healthy.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data implicated g1-TTV as another viral
infection that facilitates PCV2-induced PMWS. This raises the possibility that
torque teno viruses in swine may contribute to disease expression currently
associated with only a single infectious agent.
