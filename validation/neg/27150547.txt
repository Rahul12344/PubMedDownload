Herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis (HVHN), caused by cyprinid herpesvirus-2
(CyHV-2), has affected the commercial production of the goldfish Carassius
auratus and gibelio carp Carassius auratus gibelio. High water temperature
treatments are reported to reduce the mortality rate of infected goldfish and
elicit immunity in the survivors. To define the mechanism by which this
intervention induces resistance, clonal ginbuna Carassius auratus langsdorfii,
which is closely related to both species and has been used in fish immunology,
may represent a promising model species. In this study, we investigated the
susceptibility of clonal ginbuna strains to CyHV-2 and the effect of high water
temperature treatment on infected ginbuna and goldfish. Experimental
intraperitoneal infection with CyHV-2 at 25 °C caused 100% mortality in ginbuna
strains, which was accompanied by histopathological changes typical of HVHN. Both
infected ginbuna S3n strain and goldfish, exposed to high temperature for 6 days 
[shifting from 25 °C (permissive) to 34 °C (non-permissive)], showed reduced
mortalities after the 1st inoculation, and subsequent 2nd virus challenge to 0%, 
indicating induction of immunity. It was concluded that ginbuna showed a similar 
susceptibility and disease development in CyHV-2 infection compared to goldfish, 
suggesting that ginbuna can be a useful fish model for the study of CyHV-2
infection and immunity.
