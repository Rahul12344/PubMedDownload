Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes for several enzymes that are involved in viral
DNA replication. There is evidence that some viral proteins, by themselves, can
induce immune dysregulation that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the
virus infection. In this study, we focused on the EBV-encoded deoxyuridine
triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) and present the first evidence that
the dUTPase is able to induce immune dysregulation in vitro as demonstrated by
the inhibition of the replication of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) and the upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines including
TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-6, and IL-10 produced by unstimulated PBMCs treated
with purified EBV-encoded dUTPase. Depletion of CD14-positive cells (monocytes)
eliminated the cytokine profile induced by EBV dUTPase treatment. The data
support the hypothesis that at least one protein of the EBV early antigen complex
can induce immune dysregulation and may be involved in the pathophysiology of
EBV-associated disease.
