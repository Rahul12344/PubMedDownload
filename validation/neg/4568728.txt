Regulation of the expression of the N gene of bacteriophage lambda.

Greenblatt J.

A quantitative assay for the N protein of bacteriophage lambda has been used to
study the in vivo regulation of N gene expression. The assay makes use of the
observation that in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system from Escherichia coli
programmed with lambdaN(-) DNA the lambda endolysin is made only if N protein is 
added to the reaction. The rate of synthesis of N protein in vivo is negatively
controlled by the products of the CI and tof genes of the phage. Furthermore, N
protein activity is extremely unstable in vivo. During normal cell growth at 35
degrees , the half-life of N protein is about 2 min.
