OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C is the result of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus (hepatitis
C virus; HCV). The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) estimated that 1.5-2 million
people in Japan carry HCV. Six major HCV genotypes (GT) and a large number of
subtypes have been described in the literature. In Japan, around 70% to 80% of
people are infected with HCV genotype 1b. The progress of the disease primarily
affects the liver and may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and death. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue NS5B inhibitor and
ledipasvir (LDV) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein. They are combined in a 
single tablet regimen for the treatment of GT1 patients and resulted in sustained
virological response (SVR) above 94% in large phase III trials. This analysis
assesses the cost-utility of LDV/SOF in GT1 patients in Japan.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 10,000 patients was followed through a
Markov model until they reached 100 years of age. GT1 treatment-naïve and
experienced, non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients were studied separately.
LDV/SOF was compared to several treatment regimens containing pegylated
interferon (PEGIFN), telaprevir (TVR), simeprevir (SMV), daclatasvir (DCV),
asunaprevir (ASV) and ribavirin (RBV). Discount rates of 2% were applied to costs
and outcomes according to the Japanese guidelines.
RESULTS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective against most comparators with incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below JPY 5,000,000. By applying a societal
perspective, LDV/SOF was the dominant treatment strategy in all cases. Moreover, 
LDV/SOF reduced the number of cases of advanced liver disease. These results were
robust to sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective compared to most of the currently
recommended treatments. Furthermore, LDV/SOF extends treatments to HCV-infected
patients who are ineligible for interferon and RBV-based regimens. LDV/SOF thus
has the potential to help reduce the burden of HCV in Japan.
