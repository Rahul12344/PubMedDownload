Injection defect in alkylated and depurinated T7 bacteriophage: analysis by DNA
ejection.

Mamet-Bratley MD, Zollinger M, Karska-Wysocki B.

Using DNA ejection in vitro as a model, we have studied the DNA injection defect 
caused by alkylation and depurination of T7 bacteriophage. Phage was alkylated
with 0.02 M methyl methanesulfonate for 2 h at 37 degrees C; alkylated phage was 
then incubated 24 h at 30 degrees C to induce depurination. These samples were
treated with formamide to cause DNA ejection without dissociation of the phage
capsid. After ejection, the phage preparations were analyzed by electron
microscopy. DNA lengths in capsid-DNA complexes were measured; relative numbers
of full, empty, and partially empty phage heads were determined. To establish the
direction of DNA ejection, E. coli RNA polymerase was bound to capsid-DNA
complexes. The results showed that DNA was partially ejected from both alkylated 
and depurinated phages. In the alkylated sample, RNA polymerase was bound to the 
DNA end distal to the capsid; this showed that ejection started from the genetic 
left end. We interpret these results to show, in confirmation of earlier results 
obtained by marker rescue, that alkylation causes T7 phage to partially inject
its DNA, starting from the genetic left end. For depurinated phage, our results
suggest that partial DNA injection is responsible, in this case as well, for the 
already documented injection defect.
