Children aged 7-14 years in Novgorod, Russia, were given Russian live
cold-adapted or inactivated influenza vaccines or placebo over a 2-year period.
Schools were randomly assigned as a whole to one of the preparations. In the
first year, the vaccines were bivalent, containing types A (H3N2) and A (H1N1)
components. In the second year, the vaccines also contained a type B component.
In the first year, all viruses isolated were type A (H3N2); in the second, about 
three-quarters of the isolates were type B and the rest type A (H1N1). During
both years, the vaccines protected the vaccinated children. Where significant
differences existed, the live attenuated vaccine was more protective than the
inactivated. Vaccination rates in schools in which live attenuated vaccines had
been used were inversely related to illness rates of staff and unvaccinated
children, suggesting that viral transmission had been reduced by the vaccine.
