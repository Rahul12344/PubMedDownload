infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus.

Lupton HW, Jorgenson RD, Reed DE.

Experimental infection of neonatal skunks (Mephitis mephitis) with infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) caused fatal systemic infection. Virus
isolation and immunofluorescence tests were used to demonstrate a direct
association between IBRV and the lesions. Histopathologic studies revealed
multiple focal necrosis in the liver and the adrenal glands.
