Urine samples are increasingly used for diagnosing infections including
Escherichia coli, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. However, extraction and
concentration of nucleic acid biomarkers from urine is necessary for many
molecular detection strategies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Since
urine samples typically have large volumes with dilute biomarker concentrations
making them prone to false negatives, another impediment for urine-based
diagnostics is the establishment of appropriate controls particularly to rule out
false negatives. In this study, a mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH) DNA target was added to retrospectively collected urine samples from
tuberculosis (TB)-infected and TB-uninfected patients to indicate extraction of
intact DNA and removal of PCR inhibitors from urine samples. We tested this
design on surrogate urine samples, retrospective 1milliliter (mL) urine samples
from patients in Lima, Peru and retrospective 5mL urine samples from patients in 
Cape Town, South Africa. Extraction/PCR control DNA was detectable in 97% of
clinical samples with no statistically significant differences among groups.
Despite the inclusion of this control, there was no difference in the amount of
TB IS6110 Tr-DNA detected between TB-infected and TB-uninfected groups except for
samples from known HIV-infected patients. We found an increase in TB IS6110
Tr-DNA between TB/HIV co-infected patients compared to TB-uninfected/HIV-infected
patients (N=18, p=0.037). The inclusion of an extraction/PCR control DNA to
indicate successful DNA extraction and removal of PCR inhibitors should be easily
adaptable as a sample preparation control for other acellular sample types.
