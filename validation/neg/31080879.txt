Cancer immunotherapy and the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors have
markedly changed the treatment paradigm for many cancers. They function to
disrupt cancer cell evasion of the immune response and activate sustained
anti-tumor immunity. Oncolytic viruses have also emerged as an additional
therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. These viruses are designed to target and 
kill tumor cells while leaving the normal cells unharmed. As part of this
process, oncolytic virus infection stimulates anti-cancer immune responses that
augment the efficacy ofÂ checkpoint inhibition. These viruses have the capability 
of transforming a "cold" tumor microenvironment with few immune effector cells
into a "hot" environment with increased immune cell and cytokine infiltration.
For this reason, there are multiple ongoing clinical trials that combine
oncolytic virotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review will detail
the key oncolytic viruses in preclinical and clinical studies and highlight the
results of their testing with checkpoint inhibitors.
