Currently, health care workers (HCWs) in the United States are being vaccinated
against smallpox, and there is a possibility that this will be expanded to a more
widespread vaccination program. Inadvertent transmission of vaccinia virus to
patients with illnesses that are contraindications to vaccination is
theoretically possible. Vaccinia virus is shed from the vaccination lesion of
healthy primary vaccinees from approximately the third day to the end of the
third week after vaccination; transmission of vaccinia virus is rare but does
occur. Prudent management of the vaccination site by HCWs should virtually
eliminate transmission. We recommend that vaccinated HCWs cover the site with
loose gauze dressings and, when caring for patients with immunosuppression or
extensive disruptive skin disorders, cover the dressings with semipermeable
membranes. The evidence for respiratory spread of vaccinia virus is not
compelling, and therefore droplet or airborne infection precautions should not be
necessary, even for vaccinated HCWs who are caring for patients who experienced
serious adverse events after smallpox vaccination in the past.
