Incorporation of ligand-receptor binding-site models and transistor-based sensors
for resolving dissociation constants and number of binding sites.

Wang YL, Huang CC, Kang YW.

Ligand-receptor binding site model is used to elucidate the binding affinity
between ligands and receptors, with transistor-based sensors. AlGaN/GaN high
electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were immobilised with antibodies and human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase enzymes to detect peptides
and human immunodeficiency virus drugs, respectively. The signals generated by
the sensors because of the binding of the ligands to the receptors were fitted
into the binding-site models and analysed. The dissociation constants of the
ligand-receptor pairs and the number of the binding sites on the receptors were
revealed. The results are very consistent with the data reported by the other
methods from the literatures. The incorporation of the HEMTs and the binding-site
models is demonstrated to be useful for studying the mechanism of the
biomolecular interaction and the application for quick and cost-effective drug
developments.
