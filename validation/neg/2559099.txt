Infection of the cervix with specific types of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
results in condylomatous, dysplastic and/or neoplastic epithelial changes. To
enable routine screening of premalignant cervical lesions for HPV DNA, we have
developed a sensitive method of detecting HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 and -33 in
cervical scrapes using a non-isotopic, dot-blot hybridization assay. Cloned,
genomic HPV DNA is labelled with biotin-11-dUTP by nick translation, and used to 
screen for HPV types under high stringency conditions. DNA is extracted from
cervical cells and spotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Cervical cells, from 20
patients attending colposcopy were screened for HPV types. All patients had a
dysplasia or condyloma. HPV DNA was isolated from 80%. The method visualized an
amount of target DNA as low as 1 pg without background. Compared with Southern
blot hybridization utilizing radiolabelled probe, this assay is equally sensitive
and specific. The technique is easy to do, and may significantly contribute to
the management of cervical dysplasia.
