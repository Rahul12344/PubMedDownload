This is a case report on a 50-year-old patient, working as a forest guard in a
high-endemic region. The subject was immunized with two doses of FSME Immun 0.5
Baxter vaccine (with a time interval of 18 days between the two doses). Approx.
two months after the second vaccination the subject developed symptoms of
Tick-borne encephalitis. Clinical course and laboratory findings confirmed
diagnosis of meningo-encephalo-myelitis with moderate sequelae 1 year after
infection. Based on this clinical case we recommend in subjects with an
accumulation of risk factors, as age older than 50 years who are living and
working in high-endemic areas, a vaccination with conventional schedule (at least
two doses applied at 0 to 1-3 months) ahead of TBE season or a rapid schedule
with three doses (0, 7 and 21 days) of vaccine.
