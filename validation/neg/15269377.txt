NK cells participate in innate immune responses by secreting gamma interferon
(IFN-gamma) and by destroying virus-infected cells. Here the interaction between 
influenza A or Sendai virus-infected macrophages and NK cells has been studied. A
rapid, cell-cell contact-dependent production of IFN-gamma from NK cells cultured
with virus-infected macrophages was observed. Expression of the MHC class
I-related chain B (MICB) gene, a ligand for NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D,
was upregulated in virus-infected macrophages suggesting a role for MICB in the
activation of the IFN-gamma gene in NK cells. IL12Rbeta2, IL18R and T-bet mRNA
synthesis was enhanced in NK cells cultured with virus-infected macrophages.
Upregulation of these genes was dependent on macrophage-derived IFN-alpha. In
contrast to IL12Rbeta2, expression of WSX-1/TCCR, a receptor for IL27, was
reduced in NK cells in response to virus-induced IFN-alpha. In conclusion, these 
results show that virus-infected macrophages activate NK cells via cytokines and 
direct cellular interactions and further emphasize the role of IFN-alpha in the
activation of innate immunity.
