PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review the broad spectrum of nonreplicating viral vectors
which have been studied extensively, from preclinical studies through clinical
efficacy trials, and include some of our most promising HIV vaccine candidates.
RECENT FINDINGS: The success of the RV144 trial, with a canarypox virus-based
regimen, contrasts with the failures of the adenovirus-5 (Ad5)-based regimens in 
the Step study, the Phambili study [HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 503], and
the HVTN 505 study which was recently modified to halt vaccinations because of
clinical futility.
SUMMARY: The safety profile, immunogenicity, and variety of available candidates 
make the nonreplicating viral vectors attractive in HIV vaccine development.
Building from the success of the RV144 study, further studies of
Orthopoxvirus-based vaccines, including vaccinia-based vaccines, are ongoing and 
planned for the future. Despite the failures of the Ad5-based vaccines in
clinical efficacy trials, other adenovirus serotypes remain promising candidates,
especially in prime-boost combination with other products, and with the potential
use of mosaic inserts. Other nonreplicating viral vectors such as the
rhabdoviruses, alphaviruses, and the nonhuman adenoviruses, provide additional
avenues for exploration.
