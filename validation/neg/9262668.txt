OBJECTIVE: To compare public knowledge and attitudes about rabies and an oral
rabies vaccination program in raccoons.
DESIGN: Random-digit dial telephone survey.
SAMPLE POPULATION: Residents of 2 areas of Massachusetts.
PROCEDURE: Residents of 2 areas of Massachusetts were called to participate in a 
telephone survey. One area (Cape Ann) included 8 towns, most of which have had
rabies in raccoons since 1993. The second area (Cape Cod) included 7 towns, 5 of 
which have not had rabies in raccoons. Calls were made to 642 persons, and of
these, 265 agreed to participate in the survey. Of the nonrespondents who were
subsequently contacted again, half agreed to participate. Data were analyzed
using a statistical program. Fisher's exact and chi 2 tests were used to
determine associations.
RESULTS: Residents from the area virtually free of rabies in raccoons were
significantly less likely to consider rabies as a potential health threat for
children in their household. The perception of rabies as a threat was higher for 
residents in the endemic area. Residents in both areas considered rabies control 
to be a high priority and supported use of state funding for an oral vaccination 
program.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: People recognize dangers associated with rabies and
believe that oral vaccination programs will decrease the risk of exposure.
