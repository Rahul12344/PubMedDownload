Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an unusual form of tumor which in the era of HIV/AIDS
pandemic is increasingly observed outside the original endemic areas. It was
shown that the development of KS is in directly related to infection with human
herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). The pathophysiology of KS is complex and is influenced by
HIV co-infection and by global cytokine interactions. Skin, gastrointestinal
tract and respiratory organs are typically involved. A good therapeutic effect of
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) was documented. We provode a review of the
current knowledge of the pathophysiology of and therapeutic options for KS and
one clinical case.
