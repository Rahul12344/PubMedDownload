Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the causative agent of a disease that
constitutes one of the main animal health concerns, as evidenced by the
devastating outbreaks that occurred in different areas of the world over the last
few years. In this review, we summarise important features of FMDV, aspects of
its interactions with cells and hosts as well as current and new strategies for
FMD control by vaccination.
