The cost protein (CP) genes of two potato virus Y necrotic isolates (N27 and a
mutant strain N27-92), which differed in their reactivity to a monoclonal
antibody (mab), were characterized. Both isolates could be detected by mab 4E7,
but mab VN295.5 selectively reacted to N27 and not to N27-92. The CP genes of
both isolates coded for 267 amino acids with approximately 99.0% identity at both
the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. nucleotide sequence comparison
indicated five substitutions in N27-92 compared with N27. Three of these changes 
resulted in substitution of amino acids. Two transitions (A-->G) in N27-92
changed threonine to alanine and lysine to arginine at positions 7 and 55,
respectively, whereas a A-->T transversion changed asparagine to isoleucine at
positions 27. The surface probability curves of both the isolates could almost be
superimposed, except at amino acid positions 7 and 27. Since amino acid
substitution at position 55 is conservative, changes from polar to hydrophobic
amino acids (threonine-->alanine and asparagine-->isoleucine) at positions 7 and 
27 might have changed the epitope(s) of N27-92, abolishing its detection by mab
VN295.5.
