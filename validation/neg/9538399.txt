Genital Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) which 
affects millions of people worldwide and is mainly due to HSV type 2.
Seroprevalence rates as high as 60-90% have been reported in developing
countries. In developed countries, 20% of the general population is HSV2
seropositive. Recent epidemiological surveys employing type-specific antibody
assays show that the prevalence of HSV-2 infections is rising at an alarming
rate. Also, the epidemiology is changing with an increasing incidence of first
episodes caused by HSV-1. The natural history of HSV infection includes acute or 
subclinical first episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of neuronal
latency, and intermittent virus reactivation with or without associated symptoms.
Although this sequence of events has been recognized for more than five decades, 
little is known about the exact mechanism of latency and reactivation. Almost all
persons with HSV2 infection will have recurrences. Recent data show that many of 
these infections are subclinical: subclinical shedding can be documented in over 
80% of HSV2 seropositive individuals who deny subclinical lesions. This suggests 
that patients shed virus and transmit it even in the absence of clinical signs
and that genital herpes should be redefined as a chronic rather than an
intermittent disease.
