The annealing of nucleic acids to (partly) complementary RNA or DNA strands is
involved in important cellular processes. A variety of proteins have been shown
to accelerate RNA/RNA annealing but their mode of action is still mainly
uncertain. In order to study the mechanism of protein-facilitated acceleration of
annealing we selected a short peptide, HIV-1 Tat(44-61), which accelerates the
reaction efficiently. The activity of the peptide is strongly regulated by mono- 
and divalent cations which hints at the importance of electrostatic interactions 
between RNA and peptide. Mutagenesis of the peptide illustrated the dominant role
of positively charged amino acids in RNA annealing--both the overall charge of
the molecule and a precise distribution of basic amino acids within the peptide
are important. Additionally, we found that Tat(44-61) drives the RNA annealing
reaction via entropic rather than enthalpic terms. One-dimensional-NMR data
suggest that the peptide changes the population distribution of possible RNA
structures to favor an annealing-prone RNA conformation, thereby increasing the
fraction of colliding RNA molecules that successfully anneal.
