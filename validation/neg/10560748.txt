The recent availability of highly active antiretroviral combination therapy
(HAART) has significantly influenced the natural history of the infection,
delaying the progression to overt AIDS and prolonging survival. At the same time,
the increasing knowledge on the pathogenic mechanisms an the use of HAART have
challenged the most widely accepted theories about HIV-1 disease, in particular
about the feasibility to eradicate the virus. This review will outline what is
and what is not achievable by HAART, and will discuss new concepts in the
immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection that provide the rationale for the design
of new therapeutic approaches in the management of HIV-1 disease and AIDS.
