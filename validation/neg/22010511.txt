Indigenous and non-indigenous Western Australians with pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza (pH1N1) infection were compared for risk factors, influenza vaccination
history, symptoms, use of antiviral medications, and hospitalisation. Data were
collected systematically on 856 notified cases with laboratory confirmed pH1N1
infection during the first 10 weeks of pH1N1 virus transmission in Western
Australia in 2009. Indigenous people with pH1N1 were approximately 3 times more
likely to be hospitalised and were more likely to have a range of underlying
medical conditions and be smokers, compared with non-Indigenous cases. Age (P <
0.001) and the presence of two or more co-morbidities (P < 0.001) were
independent predictors of hospitalisation, while Indigenous status was not,
indicating that higher pH1N1 hospitalisation rates in Indigenous Australians
during the 2009 winter season were attributable to the higher prevalence of
underlying chronic disease. These results underscore the need to ensure that
influenza vaccination is delivered as widely as possible among those with chronic
health conditions.
