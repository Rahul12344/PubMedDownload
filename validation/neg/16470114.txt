OBJECTIVES: To assess the potency, breadth of action, and mechanism of action of 
the polyclonal goat anti-HIV antibody, PEHRG214.
DESIGN: Typical human antibody responses to HIV-1 infection are unable to
neutralize virus efficiently, clear the infection, or prevent disease
progression. However, more potent neutralizing antibodies may be capable of
playing a pivotal role in controlling HIV replication in vivo. PEHRG214 is a
polyclonal caprine antibody raised against purified HIV-associated proteins, such
that epitopes that are immunologically silent in humans may potentially be
recognized in another species. It has been administered safely to HIV-infected
individuals in Phase I clinical trials.
METHODS: The anti-HIV activity of PEHRG214 was assessed using neutralization and 
virion lysis assays. The target proteins for PEHRG214 activity were investigated 
using flow cytometry and by adsorption of anti-cell antibodies from the antibody 
cocktail.
RESULTS: PEHRG214 strongly neutralized a diverse range of primary HIV-1 isolates,
encompassing subtypes A to E and both CCR5 and CXCR4 phenotypes. Neutralization
was enhanced by the presence of complement. PEHRG214 also induced
complement-mediated lysis of all HIV-1 isolates tested, and recognized or
cross-reacted with a number of host cell proteins. Lysis was abrogated by
adsorption with T and/or B cells expressing GPI-linked proteins, but not by
GPI-deficient B cells or red blood cells.
CONCLUSIONS: PEHRG214 was found to potently neutralize and lyse HIV-1 particles. 
By targeting host cell proteins present in the viral envelope, which are
conserved among all strains tested, PEHRG214 potentially opens up a highly novel 
means of eliminating circulating virus in infected individuals.
