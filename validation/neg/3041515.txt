Nosocomial pneumonia occurs in 0.6% of hospitalized patients. The usual causative
agents are gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and anaerobic bacteria. In immunocompromised hosts, the differential 
diagnosis also includes fungi, mycobacteria, viruses, Nocardia, and Pneumocystis 
carinii. Important risk factors for the development of nosocomial pneumonia
include prolonged mechanical ventilation, thoracic or upper abdominal surgery,
altered mental status, underlying immunosuppression, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and the use of antacids or histamine type 2 blockers.
Colonization of the oropharynx and tracheal secretions with gram-negative aerobic
bacteria is common in hospitalized patients with or without pneumonia. The
diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia is usually based on the clinical features of
dyspnea, cough, fever, purulent sputum production, new pulmonary infiltrates,
hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. However, the clinician must recognize that the
presence of these features is neither sensitive nor specific in the diagnosis of 
nosocomial pneumonia. Microbiologic diagnosis is also difficult because blood
cultures are usually negative, and cultures of tracheal secretions, although
usually sensitive, are not specific. Invasive procedures may prove useful, but
most have yet to be studied in large groups of patients with nosocomial
pneumonia.
