Development of economic human activity has caused many harmful side effects which
constitute an important danger for the biological life of our planet. This review
discusses some aspects of the atmospheric changes and their influence on UV
radiation reaching a man. The ozone-layer depletion is the result of emissions to
the atmosphere chemical substances containing chlorine and bromine. Ozone, which 
absorbs the solar ultraviolet radiation, is a basic bio-protective filter.
Degradation of the atmospheric ozone layer leads to increase of UV-level in our
environment. The harmful effects of UV-radiation on live organisms constitute a
danger for health of the whole human population. There is no doubt that
cumulative exposure to UV radiation is important in the aetiology of skin cancer.
A strong cataractogenic effect of UV radiation has been also evidenced. It is
also known that the increase of UV radiation may be capable of activating viruses
and reduce immunological response. The recent and predicted increase in these
menaces are discussed.
