We studied the presence of tax and ltr genes from human T-cell lymphotropic virus
type I (HTLV-I) provirus in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 15
seronegative patients with tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV-I-associated
myelopathy by PCR. Only a region of the tax gene from 10 patients was amplified. 
The nucleotide homologies of six Chilean isolates to the ATK-1 clone ranged
between 98.7 and 99.4%.
