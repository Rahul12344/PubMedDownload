The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection among 107 low birth weight
transfused infants (birth weight less than or equal to 1,500 g) admitted to an
intensive care nursery over an 18 month period was evaluated. The diagnosis of
CMV infection was based on specific serologic tests (presence of IgM, increased
IgG by ELISA technic) and identification of the virus in the urine. During the
first 8 months, the infants received untested blood and CMV disease occurred in 8
infants out of 44 (18.2%). During the following 10 months, all transfusions
performed in 63 infants were supposed to be CMV negative. However, 32 infants
received untested blood due to emergency, and 5 of them developed a CMV infection
(15.6%). Finally, only 31 infants received CMV negative blood without any case of
CMV infection. These data clearly demonstrate that, considering the severity of
the CMV disease in the premature infants, transfusions should be performed with
CMV negative blood products.
