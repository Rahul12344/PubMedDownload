Identification of HIV-1 transcription inhibitors was previously performed using
infectivity assays. As de novo HIV-1 infection is highly sensitive to even minor 
compound toxicities, these assays are plagued by extremely high levels of
false-positive hits. Hit identification is further complicated because
infectivity assays lack target specificity. The authors demonstrate that it is
possible to overcome these limitations by establishing a stable, chronically
actively HIV-1-infected reporter cell line that exclusively identifies HIV-1
transcription inhibitors. In the reporter cell line, 2 spectrally separated
fluorescence proteins serve as simultaneously accessible quantitative markers of 
HIV-1 expression and drug toxicity. The combined analysis of these markers
drastically reduces the level of false-positive hits. As determination of
fluorescence intensity in a plate-based format can be performed in a noninvasive 
manner, repeated measurements of fluorescence levels over several days after
compound addition can be used to define the kinetic and dynamic characteristics
of inhibitory drug effects. In addition, because of the stable nature of the
reporter cell line, the assay requires no cell manipulation during assay
preparation or assay analysis, rendering the system extremely cost-effective and 
reliable.
