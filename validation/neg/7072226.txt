Interactions of the tritium-labeled antiviral preparation remantadine with
nucleoids and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of influenza virus were studied. The
studies were carried out both in vivo, in infected cells, and in vitro upon
direct contact of the preparation with subviral structures isolated from the
infected cell and from virions. Autoradiography of the cells treated with
3H-remantadine showed its association with nuclei (possibly with nuclear
membranes). The analysis of the results of gradient centrifugation showed
remantadine to bind to virus nucleoids in vivo and in vitro without interacting
directly with RNP. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of viral proteins revealed 
association of remantadine with matrix M protein. Nucleoids isolated from a
remantadine-resistant virus variant bound much less remantadine than those of a
sensitive variant. Some suggestions on the kind of interaction leading to the
formation of such stable associations are made. It is also suggested that
remantadine prevents M-protein interaction with cell membranes (probably, with
the nuclear membrane) thereby blocking further "uncoating". Because RNP is not
released from the M-protein layer and does not penetrate into the nucleus, the
nuclear stage of virus reproduction is shut down.
