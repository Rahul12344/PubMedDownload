In healthy carriers of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the virus-specific memory
CD8(+) T-cell population is often dominated by CD28(-) CD45RA(hi) cells that
exhibit direct ex vivo cytotoxicity but whose capacity for proliferation and
generation of further memory cells has been questioned. We show that when highly 
purified CD28(-) CD45RA(hi) CD8(+) T cells are stimulated with viral peptide
presented by autologous monocytes, the virus-specific T cells show early
up-regulation of CD137 (4-1BB) and CD278 (ICOS), re-express CD28, and proliferate
with similarly high cloning efficiency in limiting dilution analysis as CD28(+)
CD45RO(hi) cells or CD28(-) CD45RO(hi) cells. Using peptide-pulsed autologous
fibroblasts transfected with individual costimulatory ligands as antigen
presenting cells, we showed CD137L to be a key costimulatory ligand for
proliferation of CD28(-) CD45RA(hi) CD8(+) T cells and not CD80, CD86, or CD275
(ICOSL). Therefore, CD28(-) CD45RA(hi) CD8(+) T cells were not terminally
differentiated but required a specific costimulatory signal for proliferation.
