Rotavirus vaccination was introduced in Brazil in March 2006. We describe the
distribution of rotavirus genotypes in children with acute gastroenteritis in a
hospital in Recife, Brazil, during pre- and post-vaccination periods. There was a
43.8% reduction in the proportion of diarrhea episodes due to rotavirus.
Nevertheless, we observed a sustained predominance of G2P[4] as the main genotype
identified in the post-vaccination period.
