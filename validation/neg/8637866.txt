A HeLa cDNA expression library was screened for human polypeptides that
interacted with the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3D, using the
two-hybrid system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sam68 (Src-associated in
mitosis, 68 kDa) emerged as the human cDNA that, when fused to a transcriptional 
activation domain, gave the strongest 3D interaction signal with a LexA-3D hybrid
protein. 3D polymerase and Sam68 coimmunoprecipitated from infected human cell
lysates with antibodies that recognized either protein. Upon poliovirus
infection, Sam68 relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where poliovirus 
replication occurs. Sam68 was isolated from infected cell lysates with an
antibody that recognizes poliovirus protein 2C, suggesting that it is found on
poliovirus-induced membranes upon which viral RNA synthesis occurs. These data,
in combination with the known RNA- and protein-binding properties of Sam68, make 
Sam68 a strong candidate for a host protein with a functional role in poliovirus 
replication.
