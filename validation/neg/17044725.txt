Several lines of evidence suggest that cytomegalovirus (CMV) may play an
aetiological role in schizophrenia. Epidemiologically, both have a worldwide
distribution and an increased prevalence in lower socioeconomic groups. Studies
have reported that some patients experiencing initial episodes of schizophrenia
have increased levels of IgG antibodies against CMV, but not other herpes
viruses, in their sera and CSF. Treatment with antipsychotic medications may
result in a decrease in CMV antibodies, while treatment with anti-herpes virus
and anti-inflammatory medications may reduce symptoms in some individuals with
schizophrenia. There is also some overlap in the genes that are thought to
operate in CMV infections and schizophrenia. The strongest argument against the
role of CMV in schizophrenia is the absence of the traditional CMV
neuropathological changes in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia;
however, neuropathological studies of CMV have mostly been conducted in
immune-compromised individuals. Further studies on CMV and schizophrenia are
needed and may lead to improved treatments for schizophrenia.
