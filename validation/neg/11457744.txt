BACKGROUND: The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was identified as a 
common cellular receptor for both viruses, but its biological and pathogenic
relevance is uncertain. Knowledge of CAR localization in the human cardiovascular
system is limited but important with respect to CAR-dependent viral infections
and gene transfer using CAR-dependent viral vectors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Explanted failing hearts from 13 patients (8 with dilated
cardiomyopathy [DCM] and 5 with other heart diseases [non-DCM]) and normal donor 
hearts (n=7) were investigated for the expression levels and subcellular
localization of CAR and the adenovirus coreceptors alpha(v)beta(3) and
alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. CAR immunoreactivity was very low in normal and
non-DCM hearts, whereas strong CAR signals occurred at the intercalated discs and
sarcolemma in 5 of the 8 DCM hearts (62.5%); these strong signals colocalized
with both integrins. In all hearts, CAR was detectable in subendothelial layers
of the vessel wall, but not on the luminal endothelial surface, and on
interstitial cells. Human CAR (hCAR) expressed in rat cardiomyocytes was targeted
to cell-cell contacts, which resembled CAR localization in DCM hearts and
resulted in 15-fold increased adenovirus uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: Low hCAR abundance may render normal human myocardium resistant to
CAR-dependent viruses, whereas re-expression of hCAR, such as that observed in
DCM, may be a key determinant of cardiac susceptibility to viral infections.
Asymmetric expression of hCAR in the vessel wall may be an important determinant 
of adenovirus tropism in humans. hCAR subcellular localization in human
myocardium and hCAR targeting to cell-cell contacts in cardiomyocyte cultures
suggest that hCAR may play a role in cell-cell contact formation.
