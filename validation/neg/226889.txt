T4 DNA topoisomerase: a new ATP-dependent enzyme essential for initiation of T4
bacteriophage DNA replication.

Liu LF, Liu CC, Alberts BM.

A novel ATP-dependent DNA topoisomerase which makes reversible double-strand
breaks in the DNA double helix has been purified to near homogeneity from T4
bacteriophage-infected Escherichia coli cells. Genetic data suggest that this
activity is essential for initiating T4 DNA replication forks in vivo.
