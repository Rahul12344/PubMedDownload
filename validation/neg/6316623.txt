region and South America for antibody to bluetongue virus.

Gibbs EP, Greiner EC, Alexander FC, King TH, Roach CJ.

A serological survey of 6250 sera from cattle, sheep and goats in seven Caribbean
and two South American countries showed that antibody to bluetongue virus was
widely distributed in each species throughout the survey area. Overall
prevalences of antibody were 70 per cent in cattle, 67 per cent in sheep and 76
per cent in goats as assessed by an immunodiffusion test. Within countries the
percentage prevalences were Jamaica 77, St Kitts/Nevis 70, Antigua 76, St Lucia
82, Barbados 61, Grenada 88, Trinidad and Tobago 79, Guyana 52 and Surinam 84. No
clinical cases of bluetongue have been confirmed in the area surveyed and there
are no virus isolates available to indicate which serotype(s) of virus is/are
causing the infection(s).
