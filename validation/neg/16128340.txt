PURPOSE: To report two cases of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis after laser 
in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
METHODS: Interventional small case series. Two patients underwent uneventful
LASIK. History of herpes labialis in one patient and herpetic eye disease > 10
years prior to intervention in the other patient was reported. Both patients
developed stromal herpetic keratitis 6 weeks and 2 years after the procedure,
respectively.
RESULTS: Treatment consisting of topical steroid drops and topical and systemic
antiviral therapy was administered. Recurrences of the herpetic keratitis were
seen after tapering of the topical steroids; four and three recurrences were
observed, respectively. Final visual acuity was > 6/9 in both cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Herpetic keratitis after LASIK is an uncommon, possibly
under-reported, entity. Even patients without history of herpetic eye disease can
present with this complication. Oral antiviral prophylaxis may be appropriate
when performing LASIK on patients with a history of ocular or systemic HSV
infection.
