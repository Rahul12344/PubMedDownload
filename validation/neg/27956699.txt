One major concern over the clinical application of embryonic stem cell
(ESC)-derived cells is the potentiation of latent tumorigenicity by residual
undifferentiated cells. Despite the use of intensive methodological approaches to
eliminate residual undifferentiated cells, the properties of these cells remain
elusive. Here, we show that under a serum-free neural differentiation condition, 
residual undifferentiated cells markedly delay progression of their cell cycle
without compromising their pluripotency. This dormant pluripotency was maintained
during reculture of the cells under a serum-free condition, whereas upon serum
stimulation, the cells exited the dormant state and restarted proliferation and
differentiation into all three germ layers. Microarray analysis revealed a set of
genes that is significantly upregulated in the dormant ESCs compared with their
levels of regulation in proliferating ESCs. Among them, we identified the
transcription factor Forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) to be an essential regulator of the 
maintenance of pluripotency in dormant ESCs. Our study demonstrates that the
transition into the dormant state endows residual undifferentiated cells with
FoxO3-dependent and leukemia inhibitory factor/serum-independent pluripotency.
