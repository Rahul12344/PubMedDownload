Candidate mammalian odorant receptors were first cloned some 6 years ago. The
physiological function of these receptors in initiating transduction in olfactory
receptor neurons remains to be established. Here, a recombinant adenovirus was
used to drive expression of a particular receptor gene in an increased number of 
sensory neurons in the rat olfactory epithelium. Electrophysiological recording
showed that increased expression of a single gene led to greater sensitivity to a
small subset of odorants.
