Many live-attenuated vaccines for measles virus have been developed using either 
the prototype Edmonston strain or other locally isolated measles strains. The
attenuation methods used to develop these vaccines have differed in the type(s)
of cell line(s) used, number of passages, and temperatures of incubation. To
assess the extent of genetic diversity within vaccine strains and to determine
the extent to which the varied passage histories may have affected the viruses,
we conducted sequence analyses of the fusion, hemagglutinin, nucleoprotein, and
matrix genes of Edmonston-derived and non-Edmonston-derived strains. Despite the 
diverse geographic origins of the vaccine viruses and the different attenuation
methods used, there was remarkable sequence similarity among all strains
examined. The sequences of all of the vaccine strains were very similar to the
sequences of a low-passage seed of the original Edmonston strain. The most
divergent sequences were from two of the non-Edmonston-derived vaccines: CAM-70, 
a vaccine developed from a Japanese wild-type virus, and S-191, which was
developed in China.
