The influenza A virus (IAV) genome is divided into eight distinct RNA segments
believed to be copackaged into virions with nearly perfect efficiency. Here, we
describe a mutation in IAV nucleoprotein (NP) that enhances replication and
transmission in guinea pigs while selectively reducing neuraminidase (NA) gene
segment packaging into virions. We show that incomplete IAV particles lacking
gene segments contribute to the propagation of the viral population through
multiplicity reactivation under conditions of widespread coinfection, which we
demonstrate commonly occurs in the upper respiratory tract of guinea pigs. NP
also dramatically altered the functional balance of the viral glycoproteins on
particles by selectively decreasing NA expression. Our findings reveal novel
functions for NP in selective control of IAV gene packaging and balancing
glycoprotein expression and suggest a role for incomplete gene packaging during
host adaptation and transmission.
