We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with blood
cultures positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae to determine the number of HIV
seropositive patients in whom S pneumoniae bacteremia was the presenting
manifestation. We also compared the clinical presentation, laboratory data, and
outcome of pneumococcal bacteremia in patients who were HIV seropositive with
patients with no risk factors for HIV infection. All adult patients with blood
cultures positive for S pneumoniae from January 1987 through April 1989 at two
acute care general hospitals in northern California were identified by review of 
microbiology data. One hospital served veterans, the other the indigent of a
suburban area. Six (15%) of 41 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia were HIV
seropositive; five were not known to be HIV seropositive before the onset of
bacteremia, and the sixth was asymptomatic with respect to HIV infection. No
patient with AIDS had pneumococcal bacteremia. HIV seropositive patients were
significantly younger, had significantly fewer underlying diseases, and had fewer
complications of pneumococcal bacteremia than bacteremic patients with no risk
factors for HIV infection. Patients with pneumococcal bacteremia should be
evaluated for HIV infection, especially in the absence of other underlying
diseases that predispose to pneumococcal bacteremia.
