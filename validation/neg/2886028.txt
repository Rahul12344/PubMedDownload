Fusion of erythrocytes by Newcastle disease virus.

Trybala E.

Newcastle disease virus-induced fusion of chick embryo (CE) and chicken
erythrocytes has been studied at the ph range between 5.5 and 8.0. The highest
degree of fusion of CE erythrocytes was observed at pH 5.5, whereas the chicken
erythrocytes fused at pH 5.5-6.0 only. Freezing and thawing of low-haemolytic
virus preparation increased its erythrocyte fusion activity. Ammonium chloride
did not cause a statistically significant effect on the multiplication of virus
preparations expressing different haemolysis and erythrocyte fusion activity.
