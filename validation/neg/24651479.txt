Key biological properties such as high genetic diversity and high evolutionary
rate enhance the potential of certain RNA viruses to adapt and emerge.
Identifying viruses with these properties in their natural hosts could
dramatically improve disease forecasting and surveillance. Recently, we
discovered two novel members of the viral family Arteriviridae: simian
hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV)-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, infecting a single wild red
colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda.
Nearly nothing is known about the biological properties of SHFVs in nature,
although the SHFV type strain, SHFV-LVR, has caused devastating outbreaks of
viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques. Here we detected SHFV-krc1 and
SHFV-krc2 in 40% and 47% of 60 wild red colobus tested, respectively. We found
viral loads in excess of 10(6)-10(7) RNA copies per milliliter of blood plasma
for each of these viruses. SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 also showed high genetic
diversity at both the inter- and intra-host levels. Analyses of synonymous and
non-synonymous nucleotide diversity across viral genomes revealed patterns
suggestive of positive selection in SHFV open reading frames (ORF) 5 (SHFV-krc2
only) and 7 (SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2). Thus, these viruses share several
important properties with some of the most rapidly evolving, emergent RNA
viruses.
