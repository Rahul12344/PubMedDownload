OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a sentinel clinic network or an emergency
department (ED) was more timely in identifying the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
pandemic.
METHODS: All reasons for presenting to the adult regional medical ED were coded
online by admission secretaries, without the aid of medical personnel. Increased 
influenza activity defined by weekly chief complaints of fever was compared with 
activity defined by the Israel Center for Disease Control (viral surveillance as 
well as a large sentinel clinic network).
RESULTS: Influenza activity during the pandemic increased in the ED 2 weeks
before outpatient sentinel clinics. During the pandemic, maximal ED activity was 
much higher than in previous seasons. Maximal activity during the past 5 years
correlated with the timeliness of the chief complaint of fever in identifying the
onset of epidemics.
CONCLUSION: Chief complaint of fever in the ED can be a sensitive marker of
increased influenza activity and might replace the use of sentinel clinics.
