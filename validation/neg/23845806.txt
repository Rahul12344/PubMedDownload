BACKGROUND: Streptococcus zooepidemicus is an important opportunistic pathogen of
the equine respiratory and reproductive tracts. A normal tonsillar and mucosal
commensal, it becomes invasive under conditions of stress such as virus
infection, weaning, high temperature, prolonged transportation and failure of
uterine involution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccine potential
of several surface exposed and secreted proteins of a novel mucoid clone of
SzNC78 (ST-307) from an epizootic of equine respiratory disease.
METHODS: An expression gene library of SzNC78 was probed with a pool of
convalescent equine sera from a clonal epizootic of respiratory disease. Eleven
proteins were selected and purified based on putative function, surface
expression or secretion and possible importance as virulence factors. Three
additional proteins (AhpC, GAPDH and enolase) were also included based on their
putative virulence function. Groups of ICR mice were vaccinated subcutaneously
with each recombinant antigen and QuilA and later challenged with SzNC78.
RESULTS: SzM protected 100% mice (P<0.01), followed by SzP and HylC which
protected 90% mice (P=0.01). MAP, SzMAC and ScpC each protected 63% (P<0.05)
mice. No control mouse survived challenge. SzM, MAP and ScpC in combination
protected mice against a 10 fold higher dosage of SzNC78 than each antigen given 
separately. Protection against heterologous challenge (SzW60) was conferred by
combinations of HylC+ScpC (60%; P=0.05), followed by HylC+MAP (50%; P=0.06) and
ScpC+MAP (40%; P=0.1). Serum antibody responses of horses recently recovered from
Sz respiratory infection were highest against ScpC, MAP and SzP. A combination of
SKC and Sz115 stimulated no protection against challenge with SzW60.
CONCLUSION: A subset of Sz proteins reactive with convalescent equine antibody
have potential as components of experimental vaccines to aid in prevention of
opportunistic Sz infections.
