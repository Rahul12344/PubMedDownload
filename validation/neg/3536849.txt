New locus (ttr) in Escherichia coli K-12 affecting sensitivity to bacteriophage
T2 and growth on oleate as the sole carbon source.

Morona R, Henning U.

The nature of resistance to phage T2 in Escherichia coli K-12 was investigated by
analyzing a known phage T2-resistant mutant and by isolating new T2-resistant
mutants. It was found that mutational alterations at two loci, ompF (encoding the
outer membrane protein OmpF) and ttr (T-two resistance), are needed to give full 
resistance to phage T2. A ttr::Tn10 mutation was isolated and was mapped between 
aroC and dsdA, where the fadL gene (required for long-chain fatty acid transport)
is located. The receptor affected by ttr was the major receptor used by phage T2 
and was located in the outer membrane. Phage T2 was thus able to use two outer
membrane proteins as receptors. All strains having a ttr::Tn10 allele and most of
the independently isolated phage T2-resistant mutants were unable to grow on
oleate as the sole carbon and energy source, i.e., they had the phenotype of fadL
mutants. The gene fadL is known to encode an inner membrane protein. The most
likely explanation is that fadL and ttr are in an operon and that ttr encodes an 
outer membrane protein which functions in translocating long-chain fatty acids
across the outer membrane and also as a receptor for phage T2.
