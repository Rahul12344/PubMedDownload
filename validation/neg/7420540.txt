Binding of wheat germ ribosomes to fragmented viral mRNA.

Kozak M.

The specificity of binding of wheat germ ribosomes to mRNA was greatly altered by
cleavage of the message. Fragmentation of reovirus mRNA allowed wheat germ
ribosomes to bind and protect a variety of internal sequences which were not
accessible to ribosomes in the intact message. In experiments using the
polycistronic mRNA from bacteriophage R17, wheat germ ribosomes bound
preferentially at the beginning of the lysis peptide and synthetase cistrons, and
at a third site which may be derived from the C-terminal region of the A protein 
cistron. This result is similar to that reported previously in a mammalian
translational system (J.F. Atkins et al., Cell 18:246-256, 1979) except that, in 
the present study, limited cleavage of the phage RNA was necessary to activate
these sites. More extensive fragmentation of R17 RNA permitted wheat germ
ribosomes to bind and protect a great many additional sites. Thus, presence of an
(exposed) 5'-terminus on an RNA molecule appears to be necessary and sufficient
for attachment of eucaryotic ribosomes.
