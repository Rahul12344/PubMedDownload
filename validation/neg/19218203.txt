Glycoprotein B (gB) homologues within the herpesvirus family display high
sequence conservation, and a number of gB homologues contain a cleavage motif
R-X-K/R-R recognized by the cellular protease furin. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gB 
contains this motif and cleaved gB is found in EBV virions. To determine the
functional significance of this cleavage motif in EBV gB, a deletion mutant (gB
Deltafurin) was created lacking the motif. This cleavage mutant was expressed
well in cell culture but was not cleaved. Experiments examining gB Deltafurin in 
a cell-fusion assay revealed that fusion was reduced by 52 % in epithelial and 28
% in B cells when compared with wild-type EBV gB. This decrease in cell-cell
fusion is similar to that observed with multiple alphaherpesvirus gB cleavage
mutants and supports a conserved function for cleaved gB.
