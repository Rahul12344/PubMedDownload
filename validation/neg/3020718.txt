Paediatric meningitis in the western Cape. A 3-year hospital-based prospective
survey.

Donald PR, Burger PJ, Becker WB.

Between July 1981 and June 1984 1223 cases of meningitis were seen in the
Department of Paediatrics, Tygerberg Hospital. The commonest form in each
population group was aseptic meningitis. Positive viral cultures were obtained
from the CSF in 108 cases. The median age of white children with aseptic
meningitis, 64 months, was significantly greater than that of coloured children, 
45 months (P greater than 0.0001), and black children, 26 months (P greater than 
0.014). The commonest cause of confirmed bacterial meningitis was Neisseria
meningitidis (140 cases; 11.5%), which continues to affect mainly young coloured 
children (median age 16.9 months). Resistance to sulphonamides was found among
21% of 114 N. meningitidis isolates. Among white children Haemophilus influenzae 
was responsible for 9 of the 18 cases of confirmed bacterial meningitis.
Tuberculosis was responsible for 62 cases of meningitis (5%) and was a commoner
cause of meningitis than either H. influenzae (47 cases) or Streptococcus
pneumoniae (34 cases). Thirty-four confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis were
seen in children less than 1 month old. Klebsiella species were responsible for 8
cases (24%), Escherichia coli for 6 cases (12%), group B beta-haemolytic
Streptococcus for 5 cases (15%) while 4 cases each were due to N. meningitidis
and Strept. pneumoniae.
