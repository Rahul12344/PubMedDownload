Mu DNA transposition occurs within the context of higher order nucleoprotein
structures or transpososomes. We describe a new set of transpososomes in which Mu
B-bound target DNA interacts non-covalently with previously characterized
intermediates prior to the actual strand transfer. This interaction can occur at 
several points along the reaction pathway: with the LER, the Type 0 or the Type 1
complexes. The formation of these target capture complexes, which rapidly undergo
the strand transfer chemistry, is the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction.
These complexes provide alternate pathways to strand transfer, thereby maximizing
transposition potential. This versatility is in contrast to other characterized
transposons, which normally capture target DNA only at a single point in their
respective reaction pathways.
