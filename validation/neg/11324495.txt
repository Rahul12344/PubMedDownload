BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infection is ubiquitous in selected
population with seroprevalence of 60-80%. Little is known for that in China,
except few sporadic studies. To understand prevalence of HHV-6 antibody in
Chinese population, this seroepidemiological study was conducted.
METHODS: Sera were collected from 430 healthy persons and donors living in North 
China, and tested for HHV-6 antibodies using IFA with HHV-6 GS strain passaged on
HSB-2 cells as antigen, and titer equal or higher than 1:10 was regarded as
seropositive.
RESULTS: Of the 430 serum samples tested, 297 (69.1%) were positive for HHV-6
IgG. Both seropositive rate and GMT in females were significantly higher than
those in males, with X2 = 7.05, P < 0.01 and F = 7.23, P < 0.01, respectively.
Statistically significant difference in prevalence of HHV-6 antibody among
various age groups was observed in both sexes, with X2 = 20.08 and 20.28, P =
0.04, respectively, and young children had a higher titer than adults. But, no
significant difference in prevalence was observed in blood donors between various
age groups or both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HHV-6 infection with seropositive IgG is
ubiquitous in North China, and its importance should be further studied.
