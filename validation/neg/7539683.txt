Various anti-viral agents, e.g., interferon, have recently been used for the
treatment of viral hepatitis. In the present study, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV)
was cultured in vitro and the anti-DHBV effects of acyclovir (ACV) and vidarabin 
5'-monophosphate (VMP) were studied. The portal perfusion method was applied to
the livers of 7-day-old white ducks weighing 100 g, bred in Japan, and
hepatocytes were infected with DHBV in vitro. Duck hepatocytes infected with DHBV
were cultured in medium containing ACV or VMP, and the anti-DHBV effects of these
drugs were assessed by determining DHBV-DNA and duck hepatitis B surface antigen 
in the medium. Both ACV and VMP had anti-DHBV effects when used immediately after
infection; however, both drugs were ineffective in hepatocytes obtained from a
DHBV carrier duck. In conclusion, the anti-DHBV effects of these drugs were very 
limited. However, this culture system appears to be useful for studies of
hepatitis virus and anti-viral drugs.
