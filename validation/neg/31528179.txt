T cells are fundamental effector cells against viruses and cancers that can be
divided into different subsets based on their long-term immune protection and
immediate immune response effects. The percentage and absolute number of these
subsets change with ageing, which leads to a reduced immune response in older
individuals. Stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) represent a small population of
memory T cells with enhanced proliferation and differentiation properties that
are endowed with high potential for maintaining T cell homeostasis. However,
whether these cells change with ageing and gender remains unknown. Here, we
assayed the distribution of TSCM and other T cell subsets in peripheral blood
from 92 healthy subjects (44 females and 48 males) ranging from 3 to 88 years old
by flow cytometry. We found that CD4+ and CD8+ TSCM in the circulation have
relatively stable frequencies, and the absolute number of CD8+ TSCM decreased
with age; however, the ratio of TSCM to the CD4+ or CD8+ naïve population
increased with age. Unlike the obvious changes in other T cell subsets with age
and gender, the stable level of TSCM in peripheral blood may support their
capacity for sustaining long-term immunological memory, while their importance
may increase together with ageing.
