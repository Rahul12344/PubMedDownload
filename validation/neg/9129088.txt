The effects of pentoxifylline on immunologic and virologic parameters were
evaluated in 10 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients not receiving
antiretroviral treatment. Patients were asymptomatic, had 300-500 CD4
cells/microL, and received pentoxifylline (1200 mg/day orally) for 4 months.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested before and at five time points
during therapy. A transient increase in CD4 cells was observed in 8 of 9
patients, and CD8 cells increased in 7 of 9 patients. These increases were
negatively correlated with susceptibility to in vitro mitogen-stimulated
apoptotic cell death. Pentoxifylline had a temporary effect on mitogen-stimulated
cytokine production; thus, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, and lymphotoxin increased more than IL-10. Pentoxifylline also
potentiated antigen-stimulated IL-2 production and proliferation in 8 of 9
patients and induced significant but transient decreases in plasma viremia in 7
of 9 patients. These preliminary findings suggest that pentoxifylline in vivo has
an interesting but temporary influence on both immunologic and virologic
parameters.
