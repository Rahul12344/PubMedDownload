The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the Toscana (TOS) virus was expressed in
Escherichia coli by using a pET15b vector. The recombinant protein was purified
by affinity chromatography and was characterized by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and enzyme
immunoassay (EIA). The recombinant antigen was reactive with positive human sera,
and the reactivity correlated very well (r = 0.9) with that of a whole-virus
antigen when tested by EIA with 30 TOS virus-positive and 30 TOS virus-negative
serum samples. The results demonstrate that the recombinant N protein can be
easily produced in a procaryotic system and used for diagnostic assays for TOS
virus immunity.
