The symbiotic relationship between the mammalian host and gut microbes has
fascinated many researchers in recent years. Use of germ-free animals has
contributed to our understanding of how commensal microbes affect the host.
Immunodeficiency animals lacking specific components of the mammalian immune
system, on the other hand, enable studying of the reciprocal function-how the
host controls which microbes to allow for symbiosis. Here we review the recent
advances and discuss our perspectives of how to better understand the latter,
with an emphasis on the effects of adaptive immunity on the composition and
diversity of gut commensal bacteria.
