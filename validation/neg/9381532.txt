In recent years, hepatitis C virus infection has been reported to be typically
associated with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and less frequently with
membranous nephropathy. Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-alpha can reduce
viremia and improve renal disease. After liver transplantation for hepatitis C
virus-associated liver failure, standard immunosuppressive protocols result in a 
significant increase in hepatitis C viremia. In this report we describe a patient
with end-stage liver disease and biopsy-proven hepatitis C-associated
glomerulonephritis who underwent liver transplantation. Within 1 month after
transplantation, he developed a severe nephrotic syndrome that paralleled a
marked increase in viremia. We discuss the possible pathogenic relationship
between hepatitis C virus infection and the nephrotic syndrome that followed
liver transplantation.
