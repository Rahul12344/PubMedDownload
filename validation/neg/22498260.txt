The availability of an infectious cDNA clone is a prerequisite for genetic
studies on RNA viruses. However, despite important improvement in molecular
biology techniques during the last decades, obtaining such clones often remains
tedious, time-consuming and rather unpredictable. In the case of potyviruses,
cDNA clones are frequently unstable due to the toxicity of some viral proteins
for bacteria. The problem can be overcome by inserting introns into the viral
sequence but this requires additional steps in the cloning process and depends on
the availability of suitable restriction sites in the viral sequence or
adjunction of such sites by mutagenesis. Homologous recombination in yeast rather
than in vitro restriction and ligation can be used to build infectious clones or 
other viral constructs. This paper describes how, by using recombination in yeast
and fusion PCR, infectious intron-containing clones were obtained within a few
weeks for two strains of watermelon mosaic virus (WMV, Potyvirus), whereas
previous attempts using "classical" cloning techniques had failed repeatedly.
Using the same approach, intronless infectious clones of two other potyviruses,
zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) and papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), were
obtained in less than two weeks.
