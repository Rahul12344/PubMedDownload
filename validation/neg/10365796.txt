BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the histological changes in
liver biopsies induced by 52 weeks of lamivudine therapy in patients with
e-antigen positive and e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B infection.
METHODS: Twenty patients were enrolled into this open-label study. All patients
had a liver biopsy within the 4 weeks before starting lamivudine therapy.
Lamivudine was given orally at a dose of 100 mg OD for 52 weeks. A second liver
biopsy was taken for comparison at the end of week 52. Blinded biopsies were
evaluated by a histopathologist and scored according to Knodell's histology
activity index (HAI).
RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (19/20) patients had a reduction of their hepatic
necroinflammatory HAI score (components 1 through 3) by > or =2 points at the end
of 52 weeks of lamivudine therapy compared to their pretreatment values. Not only
were improvements in necroinflammatory activity observed, but 7/20 (35%) of
patients had improvement in fibrosis. This histologic improvement was independent
of the presence or absence of e-antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements in liver histology can be obtained in the
majority of patients when they are treated with lamivudine for 1 year.
