The reprogramming of cord blood (CB) cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) has potential applications in regenerative medicine by converting CB
banks into iPSC banks for allogeneic cell replacement therapy. Therefore, further
investigation into novel approaches for efficient reprogramming is necessary.
Here, we show that the lentiviral expression of OCT4 together with SOX2 (OS)
driven by a strong spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter in a single vector 
can convert 2% of CB CD34(+) cells into iPSCs without additional reprogramming
factors. Reprogramming efficiency was found to be critically dependent upon
expression levels of OS. To generate transgene-free iPSCs, we developed an
improved episomal vector with a woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element
(Wpre) that increases transgene expression by 50%. With this vector, we
successfully generated transgene-free iPSCs using OS alone. In conclusion,
high-level expression of OS alone is sufficient for efficient reprogramming of CB
CD34(+) cells into iPSCs. This report is the first to describe the generation of 
transgene-free iPSCs with the use of OCT4 and SOX2 alone. These findings have
important implications for the clinical applications of iPSCs.
