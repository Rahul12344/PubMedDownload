We determined the differential expression levels of proteins in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells of patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF). Proteins were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass
spectrometry and Western blot analysis. We identified 8 proteins that were 2-fold
or more up-regulated in patients compared to healthy control, three of which,
aldolase, thioredoxin peroxidase and alpha tubulin, were related to dengue
infection. Both thioredoxin peroxidase and alpha tubulin were over-expressed 4.9 
and 3.3 times respectively in DHF compared to DF patients while aldolase was
up-regulated 2.2 times in DF compared to DHF patients. Alpha tubulin and
thioredoxin peroxidase have the potential to be utilized as biomarkers for DHF.
