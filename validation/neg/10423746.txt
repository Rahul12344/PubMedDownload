In order to compare HIV-1 p24 antigenemia and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels as markers 
of viral replication, 3,129 paired determinations of alkaline
immunocomplex-dissociated serum HIV-1 p24 antigenemia (performed with an
immunoenzymatic assay), and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (carried out with a branched 
DNA method, a reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction, and a
nucleic acid sequence-based assay) were assessed over a two-year-period. When
excluding samples with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (which tested
negative or borderline positive at serum p24 antigen assay in 97.9% of cases),
immunocomplex-dissociated p24 antigenemia proved significantly less sensitive
than viral load at all considered HIV-1 RNA reference levels, although the
profile of positive serum p24 antigen assays (values above 10 pg/ml) paralleled
the trend of plasma HIV-1 viral load, especially at higher levels. However, serum
HIV-1 p24 antigenemia (even after immunocomplex dissociation) can be longer
suggested as a the sole virological tool in the laboratory management of HIV-1
infection, due to its significantly lower sensitivity levels compared with viral 
load assessment.
