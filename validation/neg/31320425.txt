Complete genome sequences of six Ambystoma tigrinum viruses (ATV) were determined
directly from tail clips of western tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) from 
2013 (high-mortality year) and 2014 (low-mortality year) in Alberta, Canada. The 
genome lengths ranged from 106,258 to 106,915 bp and contained 108 open reading
frames encoding predicted proteins larger than 50 amino acids.
