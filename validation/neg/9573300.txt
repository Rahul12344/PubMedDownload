We report the isolation and propagation of human papillomavirus type 16, the main
agent of cervical cancer, using human foreskin fragments implanted in severe
combined immunodeficiency mice. The infection produced viral particles, and with 
each passage of the virus it caused lesions identical to intraepithelial
neoplasia, the precursor to carcinoma.
