Pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy effectively suppresses
viral replication in 50 %-60 % of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients.
However, HCV-infected patients often display varied responses to therapy, and
strains of subtype lb (the most widespread HCV subtype worldwide) have
more-severe clinical manifestations, greater viral loads, and poorer responses to
interferon treatment. Therefore, understanding the genomic variability of HCV is 
crucial to treatment of HCV infection. In this study, we used the appropriate
software to analyze the nucleotide, and amino acid sequences of the envelope
proteins (E1 and E2) of HCV to investigate the extent of their variability in
several HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a) and calculated the ratio
of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in these proteins to
investigate the immunological pressure acting on them. We also predicted the
N-glycosylation sites in E1 and E2 to determine their association with viral
neutralization. We found that E1 is more variable, has a higher dN/dS ratio, and 
has more N-glycosylation sites than E2 in HCV subtype 1b. This indicates that the
variability of E1, its dN/dS ratio, and its degree of N-glycosylation might play 
an important role in the treatment of infection with HCV subtype 1b.
