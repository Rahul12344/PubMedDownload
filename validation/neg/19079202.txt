Early and profound CD4+ T-cell depletion in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
may drive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) immunopathogenesis, and GALT immune 
reconstitution on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be suboptimal.
Blood and sigmoid colon biopsies were collected from HAART-treated individuals
with undetectable blood HIV RNA for > or =4 years and from uninfected controls.
HIV proviral levels and T-cell phenotype/function were examined in both
compartments. CD4+ T-cell reconstitution in the sigmoid, including CD4+ T cells
expressing CCR5, exceeded that in blood and did not differ from uninfected
controls. Sigmoid HIV proviral load was not correlated with CD4+ reconsitution,
but was correlated with the degree of mucosal CD8+ T-cell immune activation.
Colonic Gag-specific T-cell responses were common, but were not associated with
proviral load or immune activation. In this select study population, long-term
HAART was associated with complete CD4+ T-cell reconstitution in sigmoid colon.
However, colonic immune activation may drive ongoing HIV replication.
