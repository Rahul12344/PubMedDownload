Osteopontin (OPN) is involved in cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, and
tumor progression in various tissues. OPN induces stemness by interacting with
CD44, but the functional relevance of OPN-mediated interferon (IFN) signaling and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in stem cell populations remains unclear. In 
this study, we investigated the effect of OPN on HCV replication and IFN
signaling in cancer stem cells (CSCs) positive for epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) and CD44. We show that the EpCAM+/CD44+ CSCs show marked HCV
replication when compared to EpCAM-/CD44- cells. In addition, OPN significantly
enhances this HCV replication in EpCAM+/CD44+ CSCs and markedly suppresses
IFN-stimulated gene expression. The GSK-3Î² inhibitor BIO increases the
EpCAM+/CD44+ CSC population and OPN expression and impairs IFN signaling via
STAT1 degradation. Taken together, our data suggest that OPN enhances HCV
replication in the EpCAM+/CD44+ CSCs, while it also negatively regulates the IFN 
signaling pathway via inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and degradation.
Therefore, OPN may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating HCV-related 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
