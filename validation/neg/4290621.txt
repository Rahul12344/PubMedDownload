Myxovirus dissemination by air.

McLean DM, Bannatyne RM, Givan KF.

Myxoviruses including 150 strains of parainfluenza 1, 15 of parainfluenza 3 and
five of influenza B virus were isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions obtained
from 300 children less than 3 years of age who developed acute
laryngotracheobronchitis during the preceding 48 hours. The patients were
examined between October 1966 and January 1967, the peak monthly rate of virus
isolation (67%) occurring during January. Parainfluenza 1 virus was isolated from
air obtained in the vicinity of one of 30 children whose nasopharyngeal
secretions yielded this agent. Samples comprising 150 litres of air were
collected for virus assay by placing an Andersen sampler about 60 cm. from the
child's face inside an oxygen tent which surrounded the patient. These findings
confirm previous observations that parainfluenza 1 virus is the dominant agent
associated with acute laryngotracheobronchitis in children in Toronto, and they
show that this virus is disseminated in the air.
