This study reports a simple, rapid, low-cost, robust, and multiplexed barcoded
paper-based assay (BPA) compatible with mobile devices. An inkjet printer and an 
XYZ dispensing platform were used to realize mass-manufacturing of barcoded
paper-based analytical devices (BPADs) with high precision and efficiency. We
designed a new group of barcodes and developed an application (APP) for the
reading of the new code. The new barcodes possess a 16 times higher coding
capacity than the standard Codabar code in our experiment on drug residue
detection. The BPA system allows applications in the assays of blood-transmitted 
infections, drug residues in milk and multiplex nucleic acids. The whole
detection process and the readout of the results can be completed within 10
minutes. The limit of detection for enrofloxacin (ENR) (8 ng mL-1) satisfies the 
requirements of drug residue monitoring. Its high rapidity, simplicity,
efficiency and selectivity make the BPA system extremely suitable to be applied
in rapid and on-site detection.
