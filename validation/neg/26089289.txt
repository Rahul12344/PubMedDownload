The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus is one of the greatest influenza
pandemic threats since 2003. The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD)
with the virulence of influenza virus is rarely addressed, particularly of H5N1
influenza viruses. In this study, BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (VN1194, H5N1). The mouse lung-adapted variants were isolated
and the mutation of E190G (H3 numbering) in the RBD was recognized. The
recombinant virus, rVN-E190G carrying E190G in hemagglutinin (HA) was designed
and rescued using reverse genetics techniques. The receptor binding activity,
growth curve and pathogenicity in mice of the rVN-E190G were investigated.
Results demonstrated that rVN-E190G virus increased the binding avidity to α2,6
SA (sialic acid) and reduced the affinity to α2,3 SA, meanwhile weakened the
viral replication in vitro. Moreover, the virulence assessment demonstrated that 
rVN-E190G was attenuated in mice. These results indicated that the mutation E190G
in HA decreases H5N1 viral replication in vitro and significantly attenuates
virulence in vivo. These findings identify one of the determinants in RBD which
can be associated with H5N1 virulence in mice.
