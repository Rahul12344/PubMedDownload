Since January 1st 2001, the Law for Protection Against Infections decrees the
duty of notification along two tracks, on the one hand by notification of
infectious diseases and on the other hand by reporting the pathogens. However,
the names of pathogens change due to scientific progress. Furthermore, these
names include in some cases not only harmful agents of infectious diseases but
also inoffensive organisms, i. e. Giardia lamblia. There are also problems in the
notification of other pathogens such as Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp.,
Chlamydia psittaci,Clostridium botulinum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leptospira
interrogans, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar
agents, Norwalk-like viruses, Salmonella Paratyphi, Treponema pallidum,
Trichinella spiralis and pathogenic serovars of Yersinia enterocolitica. Finally,
the abandonment of notification for glanders, lymphogranuloma venereum, ulcus
molle and variola appears to be risky, the reasons being partly unconvincing and 
contradictory.
