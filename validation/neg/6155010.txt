The mathematical model of phagolytic process is proposed, taking into account the
preexponential phase in the growth of the biomass of bacteria and phages. This
phase seems to be connected with the existence of biological inertia in the
synthesis of phage and bacterial proteins. Proceeding from the comparison with
experiments on E. coli and the corresponding phage, the numerical values of the
constants of the model were determined by one of the optimization methods. The
comparison of theoretical calculations with the results of experimental studies
showed that this mathematical model correctly described the dynamics of
phagolysis both in qualitative and quantitative aspects.
