BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Under-utilization of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear causes a gap in
the prevention of cervical neoplasms. A prospective population-based study was
conducted investigating whether a self-sampling human papillomavirus (HPV) test
was feasible for under-users of Pap smear and factors associated with
under-screening in Taiwan.
METHODS: Women not having Pap smear screening for > 5 years were invited to
participate in this study. Invitation letters and educational brochures were
mailed to 4% of randomly selected eligible women from Taoyuan City, Taiwan, and
responders received an HPV self-sampling kit. Those with HPV-positive results
were recalled for a Pap smear and colposcopy.
RESULTS: Between March 2010 and June 2012, 10,693 women were invited, 354
responded (3.3%), and 282 (2.6%) gave valid informed consent, answered the
questionnaire, and submitted HPV samples. The median age of enrolled women was
48.1 years. Forty-seven women (16.7%) had a positive HPV test, and 14 women
accepted further survey to find two CIN2+. Another two cases of CIN2+ were
identified from a national registry database. The cost of direct mailing
self-samplers was less than that done on request (from NT$434,866 to NT$164,229, 
response rate of 5% to 15%, respectively, versus NT$683,957 for detecting 1
CIN2+). Reasons for not attending screening included lack of time, embarrassment,
assumed low risk, fear of positive results, and perceived potential pain. Among
the responders, 90.8% found the method acceptable.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that different approaches (e.g., direct mailing
self-samplers to under-users and/or various educational interventions) must be
explored to improve coverage in populations with culture characteristics similar 
to Taiwan.
