A T-cell line derived from normal human cord leukocytes by co-culturing with
human leukemic T-cells.

A unique T-cell line, MT-2, was established from normal human cord leukocytes of 
a male infant by co-culturing with leukemic T-cells from a female patient with
adult T-cell leukemia. MT-2 cells expressed receptors for sheep erythrocytes and 
complement and were reactive with anti-T-cell and anti-Ia sera. They were
negative for Fc receptors, surface immunoglobulin, and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear
antigen. Chromosomally, the MT-2 line was male and most cells were shown to have 
a normal diploid karyotype. The cultured cells were tumorigenic when transplanted
into immunosuppressed newborn hamsters.
