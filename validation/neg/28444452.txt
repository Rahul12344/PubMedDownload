The most recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has resulted in more than
11,000 deaths in West Africa. It has threatened child health in the affected
countries, including Guinea. This nationwide retrospective cohort study included 
all children under 20 years of age with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Guinea during
the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak for analysis. Of 8,448 children with probable or
suspected EVD, 695 cases were laboratory-confirmed EVD. The overall case fatality
rate (CFR) was 62.9%. Pediatric patients with younger age had a significantly
higher rate of death (adjusted OR = 0.995; 95%CI = 0.990-1.000; p = 0.046), with 
the highest CFR of 82.9% in children aged less than 5 years. Fever (91%), fatigue
(87%), and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (70%) were common clinical
features on admission of the pediatric patients, while bleeding signs were not
occurring often (24%). None of clinical features and epidemiologic risk factors
for Ebola were associated with mortality outcome in our cohort study.CONCLUSION: 
EVD is a major threat to child health, especially among children under 5 years of
age. To date, none of demographic and clinical features, except younger age, have
been consistently shown to affect mortality outcome in children infected with
Ebola virus. What is Known: • The 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic is the
largest and most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in history,
with more than 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. • During
ongoing outbreak investigations, it is suggested that young children aged less
than 5 years are particularly vulnerable and highly susceptible to death. What is
New: • Demographic and clinical characteristics of the nationwide cohort of
pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD in Guinea are reported. • The
results confirm the high rate of death among EVD children under 5 years of age,
while none of demographic and clinical features, except younger age, could serve 
as a predictor of mortality outcome in pediatric patients with EVD.
