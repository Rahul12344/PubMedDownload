OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of human caliciviruses (HuCV)
diarrhea among infants and young children with acute diarrhea in Lanzhou, Gansu
Province, China by using molecular epidemiologic techniques.
METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from both outpatients and inpatients with
acute diarrhea in Lanzhou. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was used to 
detect rotavirus antigen (RVA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions 
(RT-PCR) were used to detect HuCV in stool specimens of RV ELISA (-).
RESULTS: Of the stool specimens collected from 515 cases in Lanzhou from December
2001 to June 2004, 264 were RVA ELISA (+) and 251 were RVA ELISA (-). Among all
cases who were RVA ELISA (-), 25 (9.96%) were found positive for HuCV. HuCV was
detected in 12 of 133 cases (9.02%) from December 2001 to November 2002, no
genotyping was performed for these cases. From July 2003 to June 2004 13 of 118
cases (11.02%) were found positive for HuCV, of whom 11 cases had Norwalk-like
virus GII (NLV GII) infection and 2 cases had Sapporo-like virus infection (one
case had combined infection with astrovirus) and no NLV GI was found. HuCV
infection mainly occurred in children under 2 years of age and no seasonal
cluster was found.
CONCLUSION: HuCV is one of the major etiological agents of viral diarrhea among
infants and young children in Lanzhou. NLV GII maybe the predominant genotype.
