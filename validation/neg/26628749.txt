One quarter of all deaths worldwide each year result from infectious diseases
caused by microbial pathogens. Pathogens infect and cause disease by producing
virulence factors that target host cell molecules. Studying how virulence factors
target host cells has revealed fundamental principles of cell biology. These
include important advances in our understanding of the cytoskeleton, organelles
and membrane-trafficking intermediates, signal transduction pathways, cell cycle 
regulators, the organelle/protein recycling machinery, and cell-death pathways.
Such studies have also revealed cellular pathways crucial for the immune
response. Discoveries from basic research on the cell biology of pathogenesis are
actively being translated into the development of host-targeted therapies to
treat infectious diseases. Thus there are many reasons for cell biologists to
incorporate the study of microbial pathogens into their research programs.
