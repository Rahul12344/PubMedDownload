African swine fever (ASF) has caused the swine industry of the Russian Federation
substantial economic losses over the last 7 years, and the disease spread from
there to a number of neighbouring countries. Wild boar has been involved in the
spread of the disease both at local and at transboundary levels. Understanding
ASF dynamics in wild boars is prerequisite to preventing the spread and to
designing and applying effective surveillance and control plans. The reproductive
ratio (R0 ) is an epidemiological indicator commonly used to quantify the extent 
of disease spread. Here, it was estimated in nine spatio-temporal clusters of ASF
in wild boar cases in the Russian Federation (2007-2013). Clusters were defined
by exploring the maximum distance of association of ASF cases using K Ripley
analysis and spatio-temporal scan statistics. A maximum spatial association of
133 km in wild boar cases was identified which is within de the conventional
radius of surveillance zone (100-150 km). The mean range value of R0  = 1.58
(1.13-3.77) was lower compared to values previously estimated for ASF
transmission within farms but similar to early estimates between farm (R0
 = 2-3), in domestic pigs using notification data in the Russian Federation.
Results obtained provide quantitative knowledge on the epidemiology of ASF in
wild boars in the Russian Federation. They identify the ASF transmission rate
value in affected natural wild populations, for the first time, which could
provide basis for modelling ASF transmission and suggest that current
surveillance radius should be reviewed to make surveillance in wild nature more
targeted and effective.
