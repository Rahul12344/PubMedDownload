Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of viruses causing dengue,
Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever and subsequently pose a significant global
threat to public health. While sampling live mosquitoes is useful for
surveillance purposes, most traps targeting Aedes kill captured mosquitoes. The
Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap, the gold standard for capturing Ae. aegypti, is one
such trap. In our study, we modified the BGS trap to increase the survival of
captured Ae. aegypti by replacing the trap's catch bag with a catch pot that
protects mosquitoes from desiccation by airflow. A sucrose-soaked sponge or
nucleic acid preservative card can also be placed inside the pot to enhance
mosquito survival and augment arbovirus detection. These modifications to the BGS
significantly increased the longevity of mosquitoes captured with weekly
survivals of 93% in a semifield structure and 86% in the field. These high
survival rates resulted in 3.5 times more alive Ae. aegypti captured weekly in
the modified BGS compared to the original BGS, despite 40% lower overall catch
rates. These cheap and simple trap modifications facilitate easier specimen
identification as well as experiments requiring live field-collected samples such
as virus detection from mosquito saliva and excreta.
