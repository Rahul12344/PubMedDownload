A purification protocol that comprised ion exchange chromatography on
DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange
chromatography on SP-Sepharose, and gel filtration by FPLC on Superdex 75 was
complied to isolate two trypsin inhibitors from Phaseolus vulgaris cv "White
Cloud Bean". Both trypsin inhibitors exhibited a molecular mass of 16 kDa and
reduced the activity of trypsin with an IC(50) value of about 0.6 microM.
Dithiothreitol attenuated the trypsin inhibitory activity, signifying that an
intact disulfide bond is indispensable to the activity. [Methyl-(3)H] thymidine
incorporation by leukemia L1210 cells was inhibited with an IC(50) value of 28.8 
microM and 21.5 microM, respectively. They were lacking in activity toward
lymphoma MBL2 cells and inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and
fungal growth when tested up to 100 microM.
