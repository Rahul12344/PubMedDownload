Although newer and more effective treatments are now available for hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection, non-HCV viral hepatitis remains an important cause of
liver disease, especially among HIV-infected individuals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide, and approximately one-quarter of
patients with cirrhosis develop decompensated liver disease within 5 years.
Initial treatment for chronic HBV infection includes peginterferon alfa,
entecavir, and tenofovir. Approximately 15 million of the estimated 350 million
individuals with chronic HBV infection have evidence of exposure to hepatitis D
(delta) virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B surface antigen for transmission 
and packaging. HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with more severe acute hepatitis
and higher mortality than acute HBV monoinfection. Chronic coinfection is
associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease. The
mainstay of treatment for HDV infection is peginterferon alfa for at least 48
weeks. Cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in HIV-infected persons have
been reported. HEV infection can become chronic in immunosuppressed patients, and
chronic infection is associated with rapid development of cirrhosis. There are no
established guidelines for treating HEV infection in HIV-infected persons. This
article summarizes a presentation by Jennifer Price, MD, at the IAS-USA
continuing education program held in San Francisco, California, in June 2013.
