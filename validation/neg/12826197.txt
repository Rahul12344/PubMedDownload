BACKGROUND: Treatment of recurrent hepatitis C (HCV) following liver transplant
currently includes alpha-interferon with ribavirin.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate nonresponder protocols for
patients failing current treatment for recurrent hepatitis C following liver
transplantation.
METHODS: From February 1998 through November 2002, 67 patients, all serum
RNA-positive for hepatitis C with histological evidence of recurrent hepatitis C,
underwent treatment with alpha-interferon and ribavirin. For patients who failed 
initial treatment, patients were begun on either amantadine along with
interferon/ribavirin or peginterferon with ribavirin.
RESULTS: Of the initial 67 patients, there was a complete viral clearance in only
14.9% (10/67). Of the 57 remaining patients not clearing the virus, 30 (52.6%)
were taken off treatment due to adverse events associated with bone marrow or
hemoglobin suppression. In the amantadine group (n = 12), three (25%) had to
discontinue due to CNS side effects of slurred speech, dizziness, and increased
depression. In the amantadine group, no patients cleared the virus but there was 
a one log drop in viral load (1.6 x 10(6) vs 0.9 x 10(6); P =.4). In the
peginterferon group, there were three (20%) patients with complete viral
clearance during treatment with similar drops to amantadine. There was also seen 
a biochemical response by month 3 with peginterferon, which was not seen with
amantadine.
CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon with ribavirin appears to be superior to amantadine
with interferon/ribavirin when used in nonresponders for hepatitis C viral
clearance.
