West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging human pathogen for which specific antiviral 
therapy has not been developed. The therapeutic potential of RNA interference
(RNAi) as a sequence-specific inhibitor of WNV has been well demonstrated.
Although multiple siRNA targets have been identified within the genomic coding
region, targets within the untranslated regions (UTR), which encode cis-acting
regulatory elements, remain relatively unknown. In WNV and other flaviviruses,
UTRs are located at the genomic termini. These regions form complex secondary
structures, which pose difficulty when designing effective siRNA targets. In this
study, we report the identification of siRNA targets in the WNV 3' UTR. These
targets were selected by siRNA predictor algorithms, and synthesized as short
hairpin RNA sequences from a plasmid-based expression system. Vero cells stably
expressing these sequences had greatly diminished ability to support WNV
replication but not the related dengue virus, demonstrating that the siRNAs were 
effective and suppressed WNV viral replication in a sequence-specific manner. The
siRNAs developed in this study could function as potential antiviral therapeutics
and as genetic tools to investigate the role of 3' UTR in WNV pathogenesis.
