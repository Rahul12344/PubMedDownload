Cronobacter sakazakii infection is particularly harmful to infants, and putative 
virulence factors of prophage origin have been identified in C. sakazakii. In
this study, the phage ENT39118 was isolated from wild-type C. sakazakii; it
belongs to the family Siphoviridae. The genomic sequence of phage ENT39118 was
composed of circular double-stranded DNA with a length of 39,012 bp. The sequence
of ENT39118 showed weak sequence similarity to some reported regions of the
prophage sequences in the C. sakazakii BAA-894 genome. To our knowledge, this is 
the first study of the genomic sequencing and annotation of this temperate phage,
which was obtained from a C. sakazakii isolate from powdered infant formula.
