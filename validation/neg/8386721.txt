Bacteriophage Mu, one of the best-characterized mobile genetic elements, can be
used effectively to answer fundamental questions about the regulation of
biochemical machinery for DNA rearrangement. Previous studies of Mu virulence
have implicated the Clp protease in repressor inactivation (V. Geuskens, A.
Mhammedi-Alaoui, L. Desmet, and A. Toussaint, EMBO J. 13:5121-5127, 1992). These 
studies were extended by analyzing the phenotypic consequences of clp alleles in 
two Escherichia coli systems: (i) the periodic replication of Mudlac transposons 
in colonies and (ii) the action of a Mu prophage in forming araB-lacZ coding
sequence fusions. The clpP::CM mutation, which removes the proteolytic subunit of
Clp protease, caused a drastic reduction in Mu activity in both systems. The
clpA::Tn10 mutation, which removes a regulatory subunit of Clp protease, altered 
the timing of Mu activity in both systems. A clpA deletion reduced the extent of 
Mudlac replication in colonies. These results point to temporal changes in Clp
proteolysis of the Mucts62 repressor as a key molecular event in the regulation
of one class of genomic change in E. coli.
