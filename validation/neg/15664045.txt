Real-time PCR assays were developed for quantitative detection of porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2
(PCV2). The established real-time PCR for the quantitation of PRRSV cDNA and PCV2
DNA were found to be in the 9-log(10) linear dynamic range with excellent
linearity and reliable reproducibility. Using these techniques, the distribution 
and quantitation of PRRSV and PCV2 in naturally infected and challenged pigs were
investigated. The viral concentrations were expressed as the mean log(10) viral
DNA or cDNA copy numbers per mg or ml of tested samples. For pigs infected
naturally with both viruses, the lung, spleen, tonsil and lymphoid organs had the
highest viral burdens with ranges from 5.73 to 8.38 and 5.65 to 6.91 for PRRSV
and PCV2, respectively. The injection of formalin-inactivated Salmonella
choleraesuis emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant 1 week before and after the
inoculation of both viruses resulted in PRRSV replication enhancement 2 weeks
post-challenge. However, this facilitated the clearance of PRRSV 4 weeks
post-challenge. Results from this study show that the established quantitative
PCR could be a useful tool when applied to vaccine development and pathogenesis
studies in the future.
