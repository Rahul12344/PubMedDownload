PCR is, to date, the only available tool for the detection of GB virus C (GBV-C) 
and hepatitis G virus (HGV) RNAs. Twenty-two French laboratories participated in 
a quality control study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of their
procedures. The panel included 13 positive controls and 7 negative controls. The 
laboratories used either in-house PCR techniques adapted from the literature or
partly standardized commercial tests. Three laboratories performed faultlessly
with the entire panel. Most laboratories had excellent specificity (100% in 20 of
22 laboratories). Sensitivity was acceptable (85 to 100%) in 15 centers and
insufficient (38 to 77%) in 7. As with nonstandardized in-house PCR, the
commercial assays gave discrepant performances in different laboratories. These
results suggest that laboratories willing to use PCR for detection of GBV-C/HGV
RNA for research or diagnostic purposes should participate in multicenter quality
control trials.
