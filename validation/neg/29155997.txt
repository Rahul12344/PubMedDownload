Response to immune checkpoint therapy can be associated with a high mutation
burden, but other mechanisms are also likely to be important. We identified a
patient with metastatic gastric cancer with meaningful clinical benefit from
treatment with the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody avelumab. This
tumor showed no evidence of high mutation burden or mismatch repair defect but
was strongly positive for presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded RNA.
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas gastric cancer data (25 EBV+, 80
microsatellite-instable [MSI], 310 microsatellite-stable [MSS]) showed that
EBV-positive tumors were MSS. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests showed that: 1)
EBV-positive tumors had low mutation burden (median = 2.07 vs 3.13 in log10
scale, P < 10-12) but stronger evidence of immune infiltration (median
ImmuneScore 2212 vs 1295, P < 10-4; log2 fold-change of CD8A = 1.85, P < 10-6)
compared with MSI tumors, and 2) EBV-positive tumors had higher expression of
immune checkpoint pathway (PD-1, CTLA-4 pathway) genes in RNA-seq data (log2
fold-changes: PD-1 = 1.85, PD-L1 = 1.93, PD-L2 = 1.50, CTLA-4 = 1.31, CD80 =
0.89, CD86 = 1.31, P < 10-4 each), and higher lymphocytic infiltration by
histology (median tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte score = 3 vs 2, P < .001)
compared with MSS tumors. These data suggest that EBV-positive low-mutation
burden gastric cancers are a subset of MSS gastric cancers that may respond to
immune checkpoint therapy.
