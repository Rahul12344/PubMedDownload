BACKGROUND: The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 046 trial evaluated the
efficacy of extended infant nevirapine (NVP) administration for prevention of HIV
transmission through breastfeeding. Infants received daily NVP up to 6 weeks of
age. HIV-uninfected infants (the intent-to-treat group) received daily NVP or
placebo up to 6 months of age. We analyzed emergence of NVP resistance in infants
who acquired HIV infection despite prophylaxis.
METHODS: HIV genotyping was performed using the ViroSeq HIV Genotyping System.
Medians and proportions were used to summarize data. Two-sided Fisher exact tests
were used to evaluate associations between categorical variables.
RESULTS: NVP resistance was detected in 12 (92.3%) of 13 infants who were
HIV-infected by 6 weeks and in 7 (28%) of 25 infants who were HIV-uninfected at 6
weeks and HIV-infected at 6 months of age (6/8 = 75% in the NVP arm, 1/17 = 5.9% 
in the placebo arm, P = 0.001). Among those 25 infants, 4 had mothers who
initiated an antiretroviral treatment regimen by 6 months postpartum. In all 4
cases, the treatment regimen included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (NVP or efavirenz). NVP resistance was detected in all 4 of those
infants by 6 months of age (4/4 = 100%). In contrast, only 3 (14.2%) of the
remaining 21 HIV-infected infants whose mothers did not initiate antiretroviral
treatment developed NVP resistance (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Extended NVP prophylaxis significantly increased the risk of NVP
resistance in infants who acquired HIV infection after 6 weeks of age. Treatment 
of maternal HIV infection was also associated with emergence of NVP resistance in
HIV-infected, breastfed infants.
