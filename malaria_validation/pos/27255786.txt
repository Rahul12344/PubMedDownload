The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) appears to play an important role in
Plasmodium falciparum endothelial cell binding in severe malaria (SM). Despite
consistent findings of elevated soluble EPCR (sEPCR) in other infectious
diseases, field studies to date have provided conflicting data about the role of 
EPCR in SM. To better define this role, we performed genotyping for the
rs867186-G variant, associated with increased sEPCR levels, and measured sEPCR
levels in two prospective studies of Ugandan children designed to understand
immunologic and genetic factors associated with neurocognitive deficits in SM
including 551 SM children, 71 uncomplicated malaria (UM) and 172 healthy
community children (CC). The rs867186-GG genotype was more frequent in CC (4.1%) 
than SM (0.6%, P = 0.002). The rs867186-G variant was associated with increased
sEPCR levels and sEPCR was lower in children with SM than CC (P < 0.001). Among
SM children, those who had a second SM episode showed a trend toward lower plasma
sEPCR both at initial admission and at 6-month follow-up compared to those
without repeated SM (P = 0.06 for both). The study findings support a role for
sEPCR in severe malaria pathogenesis and emphasize a distinct role of sEPCR in
malaria as compared to other infectious diseases.
