Hemozoin (Hz) is the crystalline detoxification product of hemoglobin in
Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. We previously proposed that Hz can carry
plasmodial DNA into a subcellular compartment that is accessible to Toll-like
receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing an inflammatory signal. Hz also activates the NLRP3
inflammasome in primed cells. We found that Hz appears to colocalize with DNA in 
infected erythrocytes, even before RBC rupture or phagolysosomal digestion. Using
synthetic Hz coated in vitro with plasmodial genomic DNA (gDNA) or CpG
oligodeoxynucleotides, we observed that DNA-complexed Hz induced TLR9
translocation, providing a priming and an activation signal for inflammasomes.
After phagocytosis, Hz and DNA dissociate. Hz subsequently induces phagolysosomal
destabilization, allowing phagolysosomal contents access to the cytosol, where
DNA receptors become activated. Similar observations were made with
Plasmodium-infected RBCs. Finally, infected erythrocytes activated both the NLRP3
and AIM2 inflammasomes. These observations suggest that Hz and DNA work together 
to induce systemic inflammation during malaria.
