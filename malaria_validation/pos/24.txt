Influence of a new virostatic compound on the induction of enzymes in rat liver.

Kr√∂ger H, Donner I, Skiello G.

The virostatic compound
N,N-diethyl-4-[2-(2-oxo-3-tetradecyl-1-imidazolidinyl)-ethyl]-1-piperazinecarboxa
mide-hydrochloride (5531) was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of
tryptophan-pyrrolase and tyrosineaminotransferase in rat liver. 1. The basic
activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or
in adrenalectomized animals. 2. The induction of the enzymes by cortisone
increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction
remained unchanged. 3. The induction of tyrosine-aminotransferase by
dexamethasonephosphate in tissue culture is inhibited if the dose of compound
5531 is higher than 5 mug/ml.
