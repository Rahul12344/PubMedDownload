Antisense RNA expression was used to assess the role of the interleukin 2
receptor (IL2R) alpha-chain in proliferation of T cells transformed by infection 
with the intracellular parasite Theileria parva. Two vectors were constructed, in
which part of the bovine IL2R alpha-chain cDNA was inserted in either a sense or 
antisense orientation in the plasmid pHS1-CAT, which is expressed by induction of
the human metallothionein IIA (hMT-IIA) with cadmium (Cd2+). A T. parva-infected 
T-cell line, TpM(803), known to express the IL2 and IL2R genes in a constitutive 
way, was permanently transfected with one of the two constructs, and the effect
of antisense IL2R alpha-chain RNA expression upon proliferation of TpM(803) cells
was tested. Antisense-transfected TpM(803) cells grew much more slowly than
sense-transfected cells even in the absence of added Cd2+, but the addition of
Cd2+ to the culture medium resulted in further inhibition. A strong reduction in 
IL2R alpha-chain mRNA was observed in antisense but not in sense-transfected
cells. These observations confirm a role for the IL2R alpha-chain in
proliferation of T. parva-infected TpM(803) cells.
