The plasma concentration of soluble P-selectin (GMP-140/CD62P/PADGEM), a selectin
produced by activated platelets and endothelial cells, was quantitated in a group
of adults and East African negro children presenting with either non-severe or
severe (cerebral) malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Sixty percent of
adults with non-severe malaria had immunoreactive levels of P-selectin above 200 
ng/ml (the maximum recorded for any normal healthy adult in the assay) and 86% of
all African children with malaria had concentrations above normal irrespective of
their clinical categorization, and most exceeded the maximum limits of the assay 
(> 640 ng/ml). There was no correlation between P-selectin levels and
parasitemia. These results raise the possibility that elevated soluble P-selectin
in malaria may have an important beneficial anti-inflammatory function.
