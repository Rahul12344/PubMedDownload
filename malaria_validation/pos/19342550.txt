Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii
(the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively), are
responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. These pathogenic 
protozoa replicate within an intracellular vacuole inside of infected host cells,
from which they must escape to initiate a new lytic cycle. By integrating cell
biological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches, we provide evidence that
both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma hijack host cell calpain proteases to facilitate
parasite egress. Immunodepletion or inhibition of calpain-1 in hypotonically
lysed and resealed erythrocytes prevented the escape of P. falciparum parasites, 
which was restored by adding purified calpain-1. Similarly, efficient egress of
T. gondii from mammalian fibroblasts was blocked by either small interfering
RNA-mediated suppression or genetic deletion of calpain activity and could be
restored by genetic complementation.
