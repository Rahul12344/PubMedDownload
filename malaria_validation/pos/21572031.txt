Cerebral malaria is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum
infection and accounts for a large number of malaria fatalities worldwide. Recent
studies demonstrated that C5(-/-) mice are resistant to experimental cerebral
malaria (ECM) and suggested that protection was due to loss of C5a-induced
inflammation. Surprisingly, we observed that C5aR(-/-) mice were fully
susceptible to disease, indicating that C5a is not required for ECM. C3aR(-/-)
and C3aR(-/-) Ã— C5aR(-/-) mice were equally susceptible to ECM as were wild-type 
mice, indicating that neither complement anaphylatoxin receptor is critical for
ECM development. In contrast, C9 deposition in the brains of mice with ECM
suggested an important role for the terminal complement pathway. Treatment with
anti-C9 Ab significantly increased survival time and reduced mortality in ECM.
Our data indicate that protection from ECM in C5(-/-) mice is mediated through
inhibition of membrane attack complex formation and not through C5a-induced
inflammation.
