Erythrocytic lipid peroxidation, activities of some antioxidant enzymes and
osmotic fragility of red blood cells was studied in adult (>1 year) crossbred
cattle naturally infected with Theileria annulata. Twenty clinically healthy
animals (group I) and 15 clinical cases (group II) of tropical theileriosis were 
selected. Cattle suffering from theileriosis had significantly higher (p<0.01)
erythrocytic lipid peroxidation and osmotic fragility. Activities of antioxidant 
enzymes, viz. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and glutamate peroxidase
(GPx) were also significantly increased (p<0.01) in group II. However, superoxide
dismutase and catalase did not show significant changes. The results indicated
that infection with theileria led to increased oxidative stress to the animals,
and even a significant rise in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. G6PD and
GPx could not lower this oxidative stress. However, the increase in the
activities of antioxidant enzymes pointed towards the body's defence mechanism
against lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress in theileriosis.
