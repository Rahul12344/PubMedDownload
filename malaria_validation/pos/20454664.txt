Cerebral malaria continues to be a difficult to treat complication of Plasmodium 
falciparum infection in children. We have shown that platelets can have major
deleterious immune functions in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). One of the
platelet derived mediators we have identified as particularly important is
platelet factor 4/CXCL4. Our prior work demonstrated that PF4(-/-) mice are
protected from ECM, have reduced plasma cytokines, and have reduced T-cell
trafficking to the brain. We now show that PF4 drives monocyte cytokine
production in a Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF4) dependent manner. Monocyte depleted 
Plasmodium berghei infected mice have improved survival, and KLF4 is greatly
increased in control, but not monocyte depleted mice. PF4(-/-) mice have less
cerebral monocyte trafficking and no change in KLF4 expression. These data
indicate that PF4 induction of monocyte KLF4 expression may be an important step 
in the pathogenesis of ECM.
