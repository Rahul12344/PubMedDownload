We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antibody responses
directed to three Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens (MSP1, MSP2
and GLURP) previously associated with different patterns of protection against
malaria infection in Senegalese children. A total of 174 950 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)
responses directed to MSP1 and to GLURP and with IgG3 responses to MSP2 FC27 and 
to MSP2 3D7. We first performed a single-trait analysis with each antibody
response and then a multiple-trait analysis in which we analyzed simultaneously
the three immune responses associated with the control of clinical malaria
episodes. Suggestive associations (P<1 × 10(-4)) were observed for 25 SNPs in
MSP1 antibody response analysis or in multiple-trait analysis. According to the
strength of their observed associations and their functional role, the following 
genes are of particular interest: RASGRP3 (2p22.3, P=7.6 × 10(-6)), RIMS1 (6q13, 
P=2.0 × 10(-5)), MVB12B (9q33.3, P=8.9 × 10(-5)) and GNPTAB (12q23.2, P=7.4 ×
10(-5)). Future studies will be required to replicate these findings in other
African populations. This work will contribute to the elucidation of the host
genetic factors underlying variable immune responses to P. falciparum.
