Theileria annulata infects and reversibly transforms bovine leucocytes. The
parasite-transformed cells are immortalized, metastatic and express a number of
metalloproteinases including matrix metalloproteinase 9 which they secrete. All
the metalloproteinases observed on substrate gels are inhibited by tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and 4 synthetic inhibitors BB94, GM6001,
BRL29808AI and Ro31-4724. We have adapted an in vitro assay for metastatic
behaviour that measures the ability of parasitized cells to cross reconstituted
basement membrane, Matrigel. Using this we demonstrated that
macroschizont-infected cells are invasive in vitro and that their invasive
properties can be almost eliminated by the same specific inhibitors of
metalloproteinases as used in the substrate gels. This demonstrates that the
metastatic behaviour of the infected cells is due in part to metalloproteinase
activity and strongly suggests a role for the metalloproteinases we observed on
gels. This is further supported by the fact that an attenuated vaccine line which
shows much reduced metalloproteinase activity also exhibits a marked reduction in
metastatic behaviour. We suggest that these metalloproteinases are virulence
factors mediating some pathological features of the disease and their loss in the
vaccine line could provide an explanation for attenuation.
