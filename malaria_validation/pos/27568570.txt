Manipulation of the master regulator of energy homeostasis AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) activity is a strategy used by many intracellular pathogens for
successful replication. Infection by most pathogens leads to an activation of
host AMPK activity due to the energetic demands placed on the infected cell.
Here, we demonstrate that the opposite is observed in cells infected with rodent 
malaria parasites. Indeed, AMPK activity upon the infection of hepatic cells is
suppressed and dispensable for successful infection. By contrast, an overactive
AMPK is deleterious to intracellular growth and replication of different
Plasmodium spp., including the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum. The
negative impact of host AMPK activity on infection was further confirmed in mice 
under conditions that activate its function. Overall, this work establishes the
role of host AMPK signaling as a suppressive pathway of Plasmodium hepatic
infection and as a potential target for host-based antimalarial interventions.
