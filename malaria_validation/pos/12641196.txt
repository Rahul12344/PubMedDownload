Leptin, which is involved in a range of physiological processes, could be an
important factor in the pathogenesis of malaria. We found that levels of leptin
in serum and urine in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice increased progressively
after infection, reaching a maximum value on day 6 post-infection. Serum values
were approximately five-fold higher in infected mice than in non-infected
controls. A similar relation was found for values of leptin in urine. Soluble
leptin receptor levels also increased significantly in serum, more or less in
line with the leptin increase. Our work represents the first report of visibly
augmented leptin and soluble leptin receptor secretion in malarial infection.
