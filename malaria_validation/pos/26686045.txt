BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency is thought to be a result of selection by malaria, but
epidemiological studies have yielded confusing results. We investigated the
relationships between G6PD deficiency and both malaria and non-malarial illnesses
among children in Kenya.
METHODS: We did this study in Kilifi County, Kenya, where the G6PD c.202T allele 
is the only significant cause of G6PD deficiency. We tested the associations
between G6PD deficiency and severe and complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria 
through a case-control study of 2220 case and 3940 control children. Cases were
children aged younger than 14 years, who visited the high dependency ward of
Kilifi County Hospital with severe malaria between March 1, 1998, and Feb 28,
2010. Controls were children aged between 3-12 months who were born within the
same study area between August 2006, and September 2010. We assessed the
association between G6PD deficiency and both uncomplicated malaria and other
common diseases of childhood in a cohort study of 752 children aged younger than 
10 years. Participants of this study were recruited from a representative sample 
of households within the Ngerenya and Chonyi areas of Kilifi County between Aug
1, 1998, and July 31, 2001. The primary outcome measure for the case-control
study was the odds ratio for hospital admission with severe malaria (computed by 
logistic regression) while for the cohort study it was the incidence rate ratio
for uncomplicated malaria and non-malaria illnesses (computed by Poisson
regression), by G6PD deficiency category.
FINDINGS: 2863 (73%) children in the control group versus 1643 (74%) in the case 
group had the G6PD normal genotype, 639 (16%) versus 306 (14%) were girls
heterozygous for G6PD c.202T, and 438 (11%) versus 271 (12%) children were either
homozygous girls or hemizygous boys. Compared with boys and girls without G6PD
deficiency, we found significant protection from severe malaria (odds ratio [OR] 
0·82, 95% CI 0·70-0·97; p=0·020) among G6PD c.202T heterozygous girls but no
evidence for protection among G6PD c.202T hemizygous boys and homozygous girls
(OR 1·18, 0·99-1·40; p=0·056). Median follow-up for the mild disease cohort study
was 2·24 years (IQR 2·22-2·85). G6PD c.202T had no effect on other common
diseases of childhood in heterozygous girls (incidence rate ratio 0·98, 95% CI
0·86-1·11; p=0·82) or homozygous girls or hemizygous boys (0·93, 0·82-1·04;
p=0·25), with the sole exception of a marginally significant increase in the
incidence of helminth infections among heterozygous girls.
INTERPRETATION: Heterozygous girls might be the driving force for the positive
selection of G6PD deficiency alleles. Further studies are needed to definitively 
establish the mechanisms by which G6PD deficiency confers an advantage against
malaria in heterozygous individuals. Such studies could lead to the development
of new treatments.
