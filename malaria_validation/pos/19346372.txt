Damage to the cerebral microvasculature is a feature of cerebral malaria.
Circulating endothelial progenitor cells are needed for microvascular repair.
Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that the failure to mobilize sufficient 
circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the cerebral microvasculature is a
pathophysiologic feature of cerebral malaria. To test this hypothesis, we
compared peripheral blood levels of CD34 (+)/VEGFR2(+) and CD34 (+)/CD133(+)
cells and plasma levels of the chemokine stromal cell-derived growth factor 1
(SDF-1) in 214 children in Accra, Ghana. Children with cerebral malaria had lower
levels of CD34 (+)/VEGFR2(+) and CD34 (+)/CD133(+) cells compared with those with
uncomplicated malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, or healthy controls. SDF-1
levels were higher in children with acute malaria compared with healthy controls.
Together, these results uncover a potentially novel role for endothelial
progenitor cell mobilization in the pathophysiology of cerebral malaria.
