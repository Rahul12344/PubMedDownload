Enzymes of the glycolytic pathway as well as some ancillary enzymes were studied 
in normal red cells parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum in culture at varying 
parasitemias as well as in isolated parasites. The levels of all enzymes except
diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and adenylate
kinase were elevated. Extreme elevations of hexokinase, aldolase, enolase,
pyruvate kinase, and adenosine deaminase concentrations were noted. In most
cases, electrophoretically distinct bands of enzyme activity were also seen.
These findings partly explain the previously noted 50- to 100-fold increase in
glucose consumption of infected red cells and suggest that further knowledge of
these parasite enzymes and their genetic basis may aid both in designing new
chemotherapy and in understanding the evolution of these parasites.
