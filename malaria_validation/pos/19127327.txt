Changes in selected blood and serum components and electrocardiography (ECG) were
investigated in 20 adults (13 females and 7 males) of water buffaloes suffering
from severe theileriosis. The age of all animals used in this study ranged 1.5-5 
yr. Theileriosis was diagnosed by observation of parasites in the peripheral
blood and the presence of schizonts in lymphocytes that were provided from
swollen lymph nodes. Statistically significant decreases were observed in the
means of RBC, WBC, and packed cell volume (PCV) in blood of infected animals. The
means levels of sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium of infected animals
were lower than healthy animals, but only the decrease of potassium was
significant. The mean serum activities of aspartate transferase and alanine
aminotransferase were significantly higher than in uninfected animals. Three
cases had atrial premature beat, 2 cases had sinus tachycardia, 2 had sinus
arrhythmia, and 1 had first degree of atrioventricular block in ECG. The present 
study showed that T. annulata infection in cattle is associated with
hematological and biochemical, and ECG changes.
