Babesia bovis (Argentina): analysis of paracoagulation proteins in acutely
infected cattle.

Goodger BV, Wright IG, Mahoney DF.

The proteins in plasma and serum from cattle infected with Babesia bovis that
react with protamine sulphate and ethanol have been characterized. Their sizes
and chain structures suggest they are intermediates in the conversion of
fibrinogen to cross-linked fibrin. In addition, comparison with reference
proteins and in vitro systems strongly indicate the proteins are, in the main,
the products of thrombin activation in vivo and not those of fibrinolysis.
