BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, host genetics influence whether a
Plasmodium falciparum-infected child develops uncomplicated or severe malaria.
TLR2 has been identified as a receptor for P. falciparum-derived
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), and polymorphisms within the TLR2 gene may
affect disease pathogenesis. There are two common polymorphisms in the 5'
un-translated region (UTR) of TLR2, a 22 base pair deletion in the first
unstranslated exon (Δ22), and a GT dinucleotide repeat in the second intron
(GTn).
METHODS: These polymorphisms were examined in a Ugandan case control study on
children with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria. Serum cytokine
levels were analysed by ELISA, according to genotype and disease status. In vitro
TLR2 expression was measured according to genotype.
RESULTS: Both Δ22 and GTn polymorphisms were highly frequent, but only Δ22
heterozygosity was associated with protection from cerebral malaria (OR 0.34, 95%
confidence intervals 0.16, 0.73). In vitro, heterozygosity for Δ22 was associated
with reduced pam3cys inducible TLR2 expression in human monocyte derived
macrophages. In uncomplicated malaria patients, Δ22 homozygosity was associated
with elevated serum IL-6 (p = 0.04), and long GT repeat alleles were associated
with elevated TNF (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Reduced inducible TLR2 expression may lead to attenuated
pro-inflammatory responses, a potential mechanism of protection from cerebral
malaria present in individuals heterozygous for the TLR2 Δ22 polymorphism.
