BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) is an important regulator 
of inflammation. Platelets are a major source of TGF-β1 and are reduced in severe
malaria. However, the relationships between TGF-β1 concentrations and platelet
counts, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
concentrations and disease severity in malaria have not been characterized.
METHODS: Platelet counts and serum concentrations of TGF-β1, interleukin-1beta
(IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and
RANTES were measured at the time of presentation in Ugandan children with
cerebral malaria (CM, n = 75), uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 67) and healthy
community children (CC, n = 62).
RESULTS: TGF-β1 concentrations decreased with increasing severity of disease
[median concentrations (25th, 75th percentile) in ng/mL in CC, 41.4 (31.6, 57.4);
UM, 22.7 (14.1, 36.4); CM, 11.8 (8, 21); P for trend < 0.0001]. In children with 
CM or UM, TGF-β1 concentrations correlated positively with platelet count (CM, P 
< 0.0001; UM, P = 0.0015). In children with CM, TGF-β1 concentration correlated
negatively with IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 and positively with RANTES concentrations
(all P < 0.01). TGF-β1 concentration was not associated with death or adverse
neurologic or cognitive outcomes in children with CM.
CONCLUSIONS: TGF-β1 concentrations decrease with increasing Plasmodium falciparum
disease severity. In CM, thrombocytopenia correlates with decreased TGF-β1, and
decreased TGF-β1 correlates with cytokine/chemokine changes associated with
increased disease severity and death. Thrombocytopenia may mediate disease
severity in malaria through reduced TGF-β1-mediated regulation of cytokines
associated with severe disease.
