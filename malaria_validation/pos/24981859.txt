Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are gasotransmitters that suppress the
development of severe forms of malaria associated with Plasmodium infection.
Here, we addressed the mechanism underlying their protective effect against
experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), a severe form of malaria that develops in
Plasmodium-infected mice, which resembles, in many aspects, human cerebral
malaria (CM). NO suppresses the pathogenesis of ECM via a mechanism involving (1)
the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2), (2)
induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and (3) CO production via heme catabolism
by HO-1. The protection afforded by NO is associated with inhibition of CD4(+) T 
helper (TH) and CD8(+) cytotoxic (TC) T cell activation in response to Plasmodium
infection via a mechanism involving HO-1 and CO. The protective effect of NO and 
CO is not associated with modulation of host pathogen load, suggesting that these
gasotransmitters establish a crosstalk-conferring disease tolerance to Plasmodium
infection.
