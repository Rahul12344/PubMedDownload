Hemolytic activity for animals infected with various Babesia species is well
reported. In this study, we confirmed that serum of Babesia rodhaini-infected
mice also showed hemolytic activity. Erythrocytes from non-infected mice were
lysed by co-incubation with B. rodhaini-infected serum. Catalase activity of the 
non-infected target erythrocytes was suppressed after this co-incubation with the
hemolytic serum of B. rodhaini-infected mice. Furthermore, serum hemolytic
activity was inhibited when target erythrocytes were incubated with hemolytic
serum in the presence of exogenous catalase. Our study indicated that hemolytic
serum can down-regulate the antioxidant capacity of non-infected healthy
erythrocytes, possibly as a result of catalase activity, thereby leading to
hemolysis.
