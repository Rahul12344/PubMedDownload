During Plasmodium falciparum infection leading to cerebral malaria, cytokine
production and cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes (PRBCs) to postcapillary
venules are involved. We demonstrate that PRBC adhesion induces apoptosis in
human endothelial cells (HLECs). PRBC adhesion modulated HLEC gene expression in 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha superfamily genes (Fas, Fas L, and DR-6) and
apoptosis-related genes (Bad, Bax, caspase-3,SARP 2, DFF45/ICAD, IFN-gamma
receptor 2, Bcl-w, Bik, and iNOS). Apoptosis was confirmed by (1) morphological
modifications by electron microscopy, (2) annexin V binding, (3) DNA degradation,
by measuring intracytoplasmic nucleosomes, and (4) caspase activity. The
apoptotic stimulus was physical contact between HLECs and PRBCs and not
parasite-secreted molecules. In addition, it was found that cytoplasmic (caspase 
8) and mitochondrial (caspase 9) pathways were involved in this process. These
data not only describe the direct apoptotic effect of PRBC adhesion on
endothelial cells but also provide new useful tools that allow an evaluation of
potential pharmaceuticals.
