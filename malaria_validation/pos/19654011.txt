Malaria infection is initiated when a mosquito injects Plasmodium sporozoites
into a mammalian host. Sporozoites exhibit gliding motility both in vitro and in 
vivo. This motility is associated with the secretion of at least two proteins,
circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein
(TRAP). Both derive from micronemes, which are organelles that empty out of the
apical end of the sporozoite. Sporozoite motility can be initiated in vitro by
albumin added to the medium. To investigate how albumin functions in this
process, we studied second messenger signalling within the sporozoite. Using
pharmacological activators and inhibitors, we have concluded that gliding
motility is initiated when albumin interacts with the surface of the sporozoite
and that this leads to a signal transduction cascade within the sporozoite,
including the elevation of intracellular cAMP, the modulation of sporozoite
motility by Ca(2+) and the release of microneme proteins.
