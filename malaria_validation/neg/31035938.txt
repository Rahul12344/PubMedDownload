BACKGROUND: Quinine (QN) remains an effective drug for malaria treatment.
However, quinine resistance (QNR) in Plasmodium falciparum has been reported in
many malaria-endemic regions particularly in African countries. Genetic
polymorphism of the P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger (pfnhe1) is considered to
influence QN susceptibility. Here, ms4760 alleles of pfnhe1 were analysed from
imported African P. falciparum parasites isolated from returning travellers in
Wuhan, Central China.
METHODS: A total of 204 dried-blood spots were collected during 2011-2016. The
polymorphisms of the pfnhe1 gene were determined using nested PCR with DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Sequences were generated for 99.51% (203/204) of the PCR products and
68.63% (140/204) of the isolates were analysed successfully for the pfnhe1 ms4760
haplotypes. In total, 28 distinct ms4760 alleles containing 0 to 5 DNNND and 1 to
3 NHNDNHNNDDD repeats were identified. For the alleles, ms4760-1 (22.86%,
32/140), ms4760-3 (17.86%, 25/140), and ms4760-7 (10.71%, 15/140) were the most
prevalent profiles. Furthermore, 5 undescribed ms4760 alleles were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The study offers an initial comprehensive analysis of pfnhe1 ms4760 
polymorphisms from imported P. falciparum isolates in Wuhan. Pfnhe1 may
constitute a good genetic marker to evaluate the prevalence of QNR in
malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions.
