DNA of Plasmodium berghei is difficult to manipulate in Escherichia coli by
conventional restriction and ligation methods due to its high content of adenine 
and thymine (AT) nucleotides. This limits our ability to clone large genes and to
generate complex vectors for modifying the parasite genome. We here describe a
protocol for using lambda Red recombinase to modify inserts of a P. berghei
genomic DNA library constructed in a linear, low-copy, phage-derived vector. The 
method uses primer extensions of 50 bp, which provide sufficient homology for an 
antibiotic resistance marker to recombine efficiently with a P. berghei genomic
DNA insert in E. coli. In a subsequent in vitro Gateway reaction the bacterial
marker is replaced with a cassette for selection in P. berghei. The insert is
then released and used for transfection. The basic techniques we describe here
can be adapted to generate highly efficient vectors for gene deletion, tagging,
targeted mutagenesis, or genetic complementation with larger genomic regions.
