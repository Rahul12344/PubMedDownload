BACKGROUND: Treatment of vivax malaria with primaquine prevents the risk of
relapse. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of 8 weeks of primaquine 
treatment in prevention of relapse in patients with vivax malaria in south and
south-east Iran by SSCP-PCR and sequencing.
METHODS: A total of 163 symptomatic vivax malaria cases were followed up in
Hormozgan and Sistan, Baluchestan provinces in south and south-east Iran between 
December 2008 and December 2011. DNA was extracted from primary and secondary
positive samples. A variation region of PvMSP-1 gene was selected and amplified
by PCR. The obtained fragments were processed in polyacrylamide gel for
single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and then sequenced.
RESULTS: Among 145 patients treated with chloroquine plus primaquine who
completed the study period, two patients (1.4%) experienced a secondary infection
after the initial episode of Plasmodium vivax. The comparison between primary and
secondary isolates by SSCP indicated different banding patterns and
electrophoretic mobility. Alignment of nucleotide sequences between pair primary 
and secondary isolates revealed dissimilar homology. Secondary isolates of both
patients were considered as reinfection. Five of the 18 cases (28%) treated with 
chloroquine only revealed secondary infection. Analysis of nucleotide sequences
and SSCP patterns indicated the relapse in all of them.
CONCLUSION: This survey indicates that intake of primaquine, 0.75 mg/kg, weekly
for 8 consecutive weeks, is effective for the prevention of relapse in vivax
cases in Iran.
