BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers great opportunities for
studying the biology of insect vectors of disease. Prerequisites for successful
analyses include high quality annotated genome assemblies and that techniques
designed for use with model organisms be tested and optimised for use with these 
insects. We aimed to test and improve genomic tools for studying the major
malaria vector Anopheles funestus.
RESULTS: To guide future RNAseq transcriptomic studies of An. funestus, we
compared two methods for enrichment of non-ribosomal RNA for analysis: enrichment
of polyadenylated RNA and ribosomal RNA depletion using a kit designed to deplete
human/rat/mouse rRNA. We found large differences between the two methods in the
resulting transcriptomes, some of which is due to differential representation of 
polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts. We used the RNAseq data for
validation and targeted manual editing of the draft An. funestus genome
annotation, validating 62 % of annotated introns, manually improving the
annotation of seven gene families involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics
and integrated two published transcriptomic datasets with the recently published 
genome assembly.
CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA enrichment method makes a substantial, replicable
difference to the transcriptome composition, at least partly due to the
representation of non-polyadenylated transcripts in the final transcriptome.
Therefore, great care should be taken in comparing gene expression data among
studies. Ribosomal RNA depletion of total RNA using a kit designed to deplete
human/rat/mouse rRNA works in mosquitoes and, we argue, results in a truer
representation of the transcriptome than poly(A) selection. The An. funestus
genome annotation can be considerably improved with the help of these new RNAseq 
data and further guided manual gene editing efforts will be of great benefit to
the Anopheles research community for studies of this insect's genome and
transcriptome.
