BACKGROUND: The DARC (Duffy blood group, chemokine receptor) gene encodes for a
transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a chemokine transporter, is a
receptor for Plasmodium vivax and P. knowlesi, and expresses the Duffy blood
group antigens (Fy). The Fy(a-b-) phenotype found in people of African descent is
typically associated with a -67t>c mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), 
which prevents red blood cells being invaded by P. vivax and P. knowlesi. The aim
of this study was to establish DARC allele frequencies in an African American
blood donor cohort, determine a phylogenetic tree for DARC, and compare human and
Neandertal DARC genes.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The DARC nucleotide sequence of 54 African American
blood donors was determined from genomic DNA. Heterozygous substitutions were
resolved by sequencing of haplotype-specific amplifications. A phylogenetic tree 
for DARC was established using the neighbor-joining method with Pan troglodytes
as root.
RESULTS: A total of 108 haplotypes of the DARC gene could be unambiguously
determined from nucleotide position -300 in the 5' UTR to +300 in the 3' UTR.
Eleven different alleles were found, including the clinically relevant FY*A,
FY*B, FY*B-67C, FY*B298A, and FY*X alleles. All phenotype predictions based on
genotypes matched the serologically determined phenotypes exactly: 52% Fy(a-b-), 
28% Fy(a-b+), and 20% Fy(a+b-).
CONCLUSIONS: The nucleotide sequencing approach using one amplicon is a practical
genotyping method for DARC and allows the determination of haplotypes even in
heterozygous constellations. We developed a phylogenetic tree for DARC alleles
and postulated a distinct FY*B allele as ancestral for the extant DARC alleles in
humans.
