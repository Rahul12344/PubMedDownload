The CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system is a powerful method to genetically modify the
human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Currently, this method is carried
out by co-transfection with two plasmids, one containing the Cas9 nuclease gene, 
and another encoding the sgRNA and the donor template DNA. However, the
efficiency of modification is currently low owing to the low frequency of these
plasmids in the parasites. To improve the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system for P.
falciparum, we developed a novel method using the transgenic parasite, PfCAS9,
which stably expresses the Cas9 nuclease using the centromere plasmid. To examine
the efficiency of genetic modification using the PfCAS9 parasite, we performed
site-directed mutagenesis of kelch13 gene, which is considered to be involved in 
artemisinin resistance. Our results demonstrated that the targeted mutation could
be introduced with almost 100% efficiency when the transfected PfCAS9 parasites
were treated with two drugs to maintain both the centromere plasmid containing
the Cas9 nuclease and the plasmid having the sgRNA. Therefore, the PfCAS9
parasite is a useful parasite line for the genetic modification of P. falciparum.
