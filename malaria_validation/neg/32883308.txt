BACKGROUND: The use of molecular diagnostics has revealed an unexpectedly large
number of asymptomatic low-density malaria infections in many malaria endemic
areas. This study compared the gains in parasite prevalence obtained by the use
of ultra-sensitive (us)-qPCR as compared to standard qPCR in cross-sectional
surveys conducted in Thailand, Brazil and Papua New Guinea (PNG). The compared
assays differed in the copy number of qPCR targets in the parasite genome.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) parasites were
quantified by qPCR amplifying the low-copy Pf_ and Pv_18S rRNA genes or the
multi-copy targets Pf_varATS and Pv_mtCOX1. Cross-sectional surveys at the three 
study sites included 2252 participants of all ages and represented different
transmission intensities.
RESULTS: In the two low-transmission areas, P. falciparum positivity was 1.3%
(10/773) (Thailand) and 0.8% (5/651) (Brazil) using standard Pf_18S rRNA qPCR. In
these two countries, P. falciparum positivity by Pf_varATS us-qPCR increased to
1.9% (15/773) and 1.7% (11/651). In PNG, an area with moderate transmission
intensity, P. falciparum positivity significantly increased from 8.6% (71/828) by
standard qPCR to 12.2% (101/828) by us-qPCR. The proportions of P. falciparum
infections not detected by standard qPCR were 33%, 55% and 30% in Thailand,
Brazil and PNG. Plasmodium vivax was the predominating species in Thailand and
Brazil, with 3.9% (30/773) and 4.9% (32/651) positivity by Pv_18S rRNA qPCR. In
PNG, P. vivax positivity was similar to P. falciparum, at 8.0% (66/828). Use of
Pv_mtCOX1 us-qPCR led to a significant increase in positivity to 5.1% (39/773),
6.4% (42/651) and 11.5% (95/828) in Thailand, Brazil, and PNG. The proportions of
P. vivax infections missed by standard qPCR were similar at all three sites, with
23%, 24% and 31% in Thailand, Brazil and PNG.
CONCLUSION: The proportional gains in the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax
infections by ultra-sensitive diagnostic assays were substantial at all three
study sites. Thus, us-qPCR yields more precise prevalence estimates for both P.
falciparum and P. vivax at all studied levels of endemicity and represents a
significant diagnostic improvement. Improving sensitivity in P. vivax
surveillance by us-qPCR is of particular benefit, because the additionally
detected P. vivax infections signal the potential presence of hypnozoites and
subsequent risk of relapse and further transmission.
