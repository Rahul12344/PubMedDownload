BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a major health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and
south-east Asia, but research on malaria in low-income countries can be a
challenge due to the lack of laboratory equipment. In addition, severe malaria
mainly affects very young children, which limits the amount of blood available
for research purposes. Thus, there is a need for protocols that yield a maximum
of information from a minimum amount of blood, which are operable in basically
equipped laboratories.
RESULTS: A protocol for tandem B and T helper (Th) cell isolation directly from
whole blood, and a freezer-independent sample preservation method compatible with
the warm and humid climate of malaria regions was established and validated. The 
protocol thereby circumvents the need of high-technology centrifuges and
unimpeachable power supply for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. Both 
purity and yield are excellent. Depending on the expression level of the genes of
interest, between 2 and 5 ml of blood are adequate for reliable qRT-PCR results
from both B and Th cells of healthy paediatric donors as well as paediatric
malaria patients.
CONCLUSION: This protocol for high purity high yield B cell and Th cell isolation
and sample storage for subsequent qRT-PCR analysis from a minimal amount of blood
is contrivable with basic equipment and independent of continuous power supply.
Thus, it is likely to be of avail for many scientists performing malaria research
in rural institutes or hospitals, and thus in countries where malaria is most
prevalent.
