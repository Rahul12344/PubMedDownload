Mosquitoes are vectors for multiple infectious human diseases and use a variety
of sensory cues (olfactory, temperature, humidity and visual) to locate a human
host. A comprehensive understanding of the circuitry underlying sensory
signalling in the mosquito brain is lacking. Here we used the Q-system of binary 
gene expression to develop transgenic lines of Anopheles gambiae in which
olfactory receptor neurons expressing the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco)
gene are labelled with GFP. These neurons project from the antennae and maxillary
palps to the antennal lobe (AL) and from the labella on the proboscis to the
suboesophageal zone (SEZ), suggesting integration of olfactory and gustatory
signals occurs in this brain region. We present detailed anatomical maps of
olfactory innervations in the AL and the SEZ, identifying glomeruli that may
respond to human body odours or carbon dioxide. Our results pave the way for
anatomical and functional neurogenetic studies of sensory processing in
mosquitoes.
