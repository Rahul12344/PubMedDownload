Coordinated regulation of gene expression is a hallmark of the Plasmodium
falciparum asexual blood-stage development cycle. We report that carbon
catabolite repressor protein 4 (CCR4)-associated factor 1 (CAF1) is critical in
regulating more than 1,000 genes during malaria parasites' intraerythrocytic
stages, especially egress and invasion proteins. CAF1 knockout results in
mistimed expression, aberrant accumulation and localization of proteins involved 
in parasite egress, and invasion of new host cells, leading to premature release 
of predominantly half-finished merozoites, drastically reducing the
intraerythrocytic growth rate of the parasite. This study demonstrates that CAF1 
of the CCR4-Not complex is a significant gene regulatory mechanism needed for
Plasmodium development within the human host.
