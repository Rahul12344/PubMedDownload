Despite efforts to eliminate it, malaria remains a major public health concern,
particularly in Côte d'Ivoire. Chloroquine (CQ) was one of the first drugs used
for its treatment, but was officially withdrawn from the market in 2007 following
reports of high levels of chloroquine resistance. The present study was carried
out after the withdrawal of CQ and provides an update on the rates of CQ
resistance in Côte d'Ivoire. Samples were collected between September 2013 and
March 2014 in Abidjan and from January to May 2016 in Abengourou and San Pedro
through cross-sectional studies. Parasitemia was assessed by microscopy, and
single nucleotide polymorphism in the Pfcrt (codon 76) gene was analyzed by
nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of 343 samples
were analyzed: 119, 106 and 118 were from Abidjan, Abengourou, and San Pedro,
respectively. The sex ratio of patients was 0.92. The mean age of patients
enrolled was 9.6 years (SD = 10.8). The geometric mean of parasite density was
21,337 parasites/μL (SD = 49,508; range, 2,000-200,000). Molecular analysis
revealed 57 K76T mutants (16.6%): 33, 9, and 15 in Abidjan, Abengourou and in San
Pedro, respectively. Most of these were found in patients aged ≤15 years (42/57) 
who had parasitemia greater than 10,000 parasites/μL (40/57). This is the first
study conducted in Côte d'Ivoire reporting a decline in Pfcrt K76T mutation rate.
Thus, our results indicate the importance of following up on the observed trend
also at a national level.
