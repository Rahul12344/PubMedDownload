Malaria is one of the most severe tropical infectious diseases. More than 220
million people around the world have a clinical malaria infection and about one
million die because of Plasmodium annually. This parasitic pathogen replicates
efficiently in its human host making it difficult to eradicate. It is transmitted
by mosquito vectors and so far mosquito control programs have not effectively
eliminated this transmission. Because of malaria's enormous health and economic
impact and the need to develop new control and eventual elimination strategies, a
big research effort has been made to better understand the biology of this
parasite and its interactions with its vertebrate host. Determination of the
genome sequence and organization, the elucidation of the role of key proteins,
and cell signaling studies have helped to develop an understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that provide the parasite's versatility. The parasite can
sense its environment and adapt to benefit its survival, indeed this is essential
for it to complete its life cycle. For many years we have studied how the
Plasmodium parasite is able to sense melatonin. In this review we discuss the
melatonin signaling pathway and its role in the control of Plasmodium replication
and development.
