P. vivax infection during pregnancy has been associated with poor outcomes such
as anemia, low birth weight and congenital malaria, thus representing an
important global health problem. However, no vaccine is currently available for
its prevention. Vir genes were the first putative virulent factors associated
with P. vivax infections, yet very few studies have examined their potential role
as targets of immunity. We investigated the immunogenic properties of five VIR
proteins and two long synthetic peptides containing conserved VIR sequences
(PvLP1 and PvLP2) in the context of the PregVax cohort study including women from
five malaria endemic countries: Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, India and Papua New 
Guinea (PNG) at different timepoints during and after pregnancy. Antibody
responses against all antigens were detected in all populations, with PNG women
presenting the highest levels overall. P. vivax infection at sample collection
time was positively associated with antibody levels against PvLP1 (fold-increase:
1.60 at recruitment -first antenatal visit-) and PvLP2 (fold-increase: 1.63 at
delivery), and P. falciparum co-infection was found to increase those responses
(for PvLP1 at recruitment, fold-increase: 2.25). Levels of IgG against two VIR
proteins at delivery were associated with higher birth weight (27 g increase per 
duplicating antibody levels, p<0.05). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PNG
uninfected pregnant women had significantly higher antigen-specific IFN-γ TH1
responses (p=0.006) and secreted less pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6
after PvLP2 stimulation than P. vivax-infected women (p<0.05). These data
demonstrate that VIR antigens induce the natural acquisition of antibody and T
cell memory responses that might be important in immunity to P. vivax during
pregnancy in very diverse geographical settings.

Conflict of interest statement: HdP is the co-founder of INNOVEX THERAPEUTICS SL 
which holds proprietary rights to use PvLP1 and PvLP2 as vaccine candidates
against vivax malaria; thus, having potential conflicts of interest. There are no
other conflicts of interest.
