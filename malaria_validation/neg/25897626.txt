During 2010-2012, an outbreak of 210 cases of malaria occurred in Tumbes, in the 
northern coast of Peru, where no Plasmodium falciparum malaria case had been
reported since 2006. To identify the source of the parasite causing this
outbreak, we conducted a molecular epidemiology investigation. Microsatellite
typing showed an identical genotype in all 54 available isolates. This genotype
was also identical to that of parasites isolated in 2010 in the Loreto region of 
the Peruvian Amazon and closely related to clonet B, a parasite lineage
previously reported in the Amazon during 1998-2000. These findings are consistent
with travel history of index case-patients. DNA sequencing revealed mutations in 
the Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfcrt, and Pfmdr1 loci, which are strongly associated with
resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and deletion of the
Pfhrp2 gene. These results highlight the need for timely molecular epidemiology
investigations to trace the parasite source during malaria reintroduction events.
