Odisha state is highly endemic for malaria and among several Anopheline species
found in the state, Anopheles subpictus is known to be one of the most prevalent 
species. An. subpictus complex consists of four sibling species i,e A,B,C and D. 
However, no work has been conducted on prevalence of sibling species of An.
subpictus in Odisha. Hence attempt was made to study the prevalence of sibling
species of An. subpictus and their role in transmission of malaria in four
districts i,e Angul, Khurda, Cuttack and Puri of Odisha using Mitochondrial Gene,
Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) known as DNA barcode. The sibling species B 
of An. subpictus with sporozoite were reported for the first time in Odisha.
