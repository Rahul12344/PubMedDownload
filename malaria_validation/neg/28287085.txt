Eggs produced by the mature female parasite are responsible for the pathogenesis 
and transmission of schistosomiasis. Female schistosomes rely on a unique
male-induced strategy to accomplish reproductive development, a process that is
incompletely understood. Here we map detailed transcriptomic profiles of male and
female Schistosoma japonicum across eight time points throughout the sexual
developmental process from pairing to maturation. The dynamic gene expression
pattern data reveal clear sex-related characteristics, indicative of an
unambiguous functional division between males and females during their interplay.
Cluster analysis, in situ hybridization and RNAi assays indicate that males
likely use biogenic amine neurotransmitters through the nervous system to control
and maintain pairing with females. In addition, the analyses indicate that
reproductive development of females involves an insect-like hormonal regulation. 
These data sets and analyses serve as a foundation for deeper study of sexual
development in this pathogen and identification of novel anti-schistosomal
interventions.
