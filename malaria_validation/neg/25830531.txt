Plasmodium knowlesi is a newly described zoonosis that causes malaria in the
human population that can be severe and fatal. The study of P. knowlesi parasites
from human clinical isolates is relatively new and, in order to obtain maximum
information from patient sample collections, we explored the possibility of
generating P. knowlesi genome sequences from archived clinical isolates. Our
patient sample collection consisted of frozen whole blood samples that contained 
excessive human DNA contamination and, in that form, were not suitable for
parasite genome sequencing. We developed a method to reduce the amount of human
DNA in the thawed blood samples in preparation for high throughput parasite
genome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencing platforms. Seven of
fifteen samples processed had sufficiently pure P. knowlesi DNA for whole genome 
sequencing. The reads were mapped to the P. knowlesi H strain reference genome
and an average mapping of 90% was obtained. Genes with low coverage were removed 
leaving 4623 genes for subsequent analyses. Previously we identified a DNA
sequence dimorphism on a small fragment of the P. knowlesi normocyte binding
protein xa gene on chromosome 14. We used the genome data to assemble full-length
Pknbpxa sequences and discovered that the dimorphism extended along the gene. An 
in-house algorithm was developed to detect SNP sites co-associating with the
dimorphism. More than half of the P. knowlesi genome was dimorphic, involving
genes on all chromosomes and suggesting that two distinct types of P. knowlesi
infect the human population in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We use P. knowlesi
clinical samples to demonstrate that Plasmodium DNA from archived patient samples
can produce high quality genome data. We show that analyses, of even small
numbers of difficult clinical malaria isolates, can generate comprehensive
genomic information that will improve our understanding of malaria parasite
diversity and pathobiology.
