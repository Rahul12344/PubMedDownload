OBJECTIVES: A CD1d-binding invariant natural killer T (iNKT)-cell stimulatory
glycolipid, namely 7DW8-5, is shown to enhance the efficacy of
radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS)-based malaria vaccine in mice. In the
current study, we aim to determine whether 7DW8-5 can display a potent adjuvant
effect in human immune system (HIS) mice.
METHODS: HIS-A2/hCD1d mice, which possess both functional human iNKT cells and
CD8+ T cells, were generated by the transduction of NSG mice with
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing genes that encode human CD1d
molecules and HLA-A*0201, followed by the engraftment of human hematopoietic stem
cells. The magnitudes of human iNKT-cell response against 7DW8-5 and
HLA-A*0201-restricted human CD8+ T-cell response against a human malaria antigen 
in HIS-A2/hCD1d mice were determined by using human CD1d tetramer and human
HLA-A*0201 tetramer, respectively.
RESULTS: We found that 7DW8-5 stimulates human iNKT cells in HIS-A2/hCD1d mice,
as well as those derived from HIS-A2/hCD1d mice in vitro. We also found that
7DW8-5 significantly increases the level of a human malarial antigen-specific
HLA-A*0201-restricted human CD8+ T-cell response in HIS-A2/hCD1d mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that 7DW8-5 can display a potent adjuvant effect
on RAS vaccine-induced anti-malarial immunity by augmenting malaria-specific
human CD8+ T-cell response.
