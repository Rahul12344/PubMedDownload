Malaria parasite transmission depends upon the successful development of
Plasmodium in its Anopheles mosquito vector. The mosquito's innate immune system 
constitutes a major bottleneck for parasite population growth. We show here that 
in Anopheles gambiae, the midgut-specific transcription factor Caudal acts as a
negative regulator in the Imd pathway-mediated immune response against the human 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Caudal also modulates the mosquito midgut
bacterial flora. RNAi-mediated silencing of Caudal enhanced the mosquito's
resistance to bacterial infections and increased the transcriptional abundance of
key immune effector genes. Interestingly, Caudal's silencing resulted in an
increased lifespan of the mosquito, while it impaired reproductive fitness with
respect to egg laying and hatching.
