BACKGROUND: Host genotype accounts for a component of the variability in
susceptibility to childhood Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, despite
numerous examples of host polymorphisms associated with tolerance or resistance
to infection, direct evidence for an impact of host genetic polymorphisms on the 
in vivo parasite population is difficult to obtain. Parasite molecules whose
expression is most likely to be associated with such adaptation are those that
are directly involved in the host-parasite interaction. A prime candidate is the 
family of parasite var gene-encoded molecules on P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes, PfEMP1, which binds various host molecules and facilitates parasite
sequestration in host tissues to avoid clearance by the spleen.
METHODS: To assess the impact of host genotype on the infecting parasite
population we used a published parasite var gene sequence dataset to compare var 
gene expression patterns between parasites from children with polymorphisms in
molecules thought to interact with or modulate display of PfEMP1 on the infected 
erythrocyte surface: ABO blood group, haemoglobin S, alpha-thalassaemia, the
T188G polymorphism of CD36 and the K29M polymorphism of ICAM1.
RESULTS: Expression levels of 'group A-like' var genes, which encode a specific
group of PfEMP1 variants previously associated with low host immunity and severe 
malaria, showed signs of elevation among children of blood group AB. No other
host factor tested showed evidence for an association with var expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that host ABO blood group may have 
a measurable impact on the infecting parasite population. This needs to be
verified in larger studies.
