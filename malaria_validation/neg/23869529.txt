Plasmodium parasites remodel their vertebrate host cells by translocating
hundreds of proteins across an encasing membrane into the host cell cytosol via a
putative export machinery termed PTEX. Previously PTEX150, HSP101 and EXP2 have
been shown to be bona fide members of PTEX. Here we validate that PTEX88 and TRX2
are also genuine members of PTEX and provide evidence that expression of PTEX
components are also expressed in early gametocytes, mosquito and liver stages,
consistent with observations that protein export is not restricted to asexual
stages. Although amenable to genetic tagging, HSP101, PTEX150, EXP2 and PTEX88
could not be genetically deleted in Plasmodium berghei, in keeping with the
obligatory role this complex is postulated to have in maintaining normal
blood-stage growth. In contrast, the putative thioredoxin-like protein TRX2 could
be deleted, with knockout parasites displaying reduced grow-rates, both in vivo
and in vitro, and reduced capacity to cause severe disease in a cerebral malaria 
model. Thus, while not essential for parasite survival, TRX2 may help to optimize
PTEX activity. Importantly, the generation of TRX2 knockout parasites that
display altered phenotypes provides a much-needed tool to dissect PTEX function.
