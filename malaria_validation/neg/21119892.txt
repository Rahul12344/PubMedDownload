With the completion and near completion of many malaria parasite
genome-sequencing projects, efforts are now being directed to a better
understanding of gene functions and to the discovery of vaccine and drug targets.
Inter- and intraspecies comparisons of the parasite genomes will provide
invaluable insights into parasite evolution, virulence, drug resistance, and
immune invasion. Genome-wide searches for loci under various selection pressures 
may lead to discovery of genes conferring drug resistance or encoding for
protective antigens. In addition, the Plasmodium falciparum genome sequence
provides the basis for the development of various microarrays to monitor gene
expression and to detect nucleotide substitution and deletion/amplification.
Genome-wide profiling of the parasite proteome, chromatin modification, and
nucleosome position also depend on availability of the parasite genome. In this
brief review, we will highlight some recent advances and studies in
characterizing gene function and related phenotype in P. falciparum that were
made possible by the genome sequence, particularly the development of a
genome-wide diversity map and various high-throughput genotyping methods for
genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
