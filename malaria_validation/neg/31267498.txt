Malaria continues to be a global health burden, threatening over 40% of the
world's population. Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological
agent of the majority of human malaria cases, is compromising elimination
efforts. New approaches to treating drug-resistant malaria benefit from defining 
resistance liabilities of known antimalarial agents and compounds in development 
and defining genetic changes that mediate loss of parasite susceptibility. Here, 
we present protocols for in vitro selection of drug-resistant parasites and for
site-directed gene editing of candidate resistance mediators to test for
causality.
