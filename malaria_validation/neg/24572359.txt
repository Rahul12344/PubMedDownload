Commitment to and completion of sexual development are essential for malaria
parasites (protists of the genus Plasmodium) to be transmitted through
mosquitoes. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for commitment have been
hitherto unknown. Here we show that PbAP2-G, a conserved member of the
apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) family of DNA-binding proteins, is essential for the
commitment of asexually replicating forms to sexual development in Plasmodium
berghei, a malaria parasite of rodents. PbAP2-G was identified from mutations in 
its encoding gene, PBANKA_143750, which account for the loss of sexual
development frequently observed in parasites transmitted artificially by blood
passage. Systematic gene deletion of conserved ApiAP2 genes in Plasmodium
confirmed the role of PbAP2-G and revealed a second ApiAP2 member (PBANKA_103430,
here termed PbAP2-G2) that significantly modulates but does not abolish
gametocytogenesis, indicating that a cascade of ApiAP2 proteins are involved in
commitment to the production and maturation of gametocytes. The data suggest a
mechanism of commitment to gametocytogenesis in Plasmodium consistent with a
positive feedback loop involving PbAP2-G that could be exploited to prevent the
transmission of this pernicious parasite.
