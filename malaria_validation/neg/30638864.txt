BACKGROUND: Transcriptomic research of blood cell lineages supports the
understanding of distinct features of the immunopathology in human malaria.
METHODS: We used microarray hybridization, validated by real-time RT-PCR to
analyze whole blood gene expression in healthy Gabonese children and children
with various conditions of Plasmodium falciparum infection, including i)
asymptomatic infection, ii) uncomplicated malaria, iii) malaria associated with
severe anemia and iv) cerebral malaria.
FINDINGS: Our data indicate that the expression profile of 22 genes significantly
differed among the investigated groups. Immunoglobulin production, complement
regulation and IFN beta signaling, in particular IRF7 and ISRE binding signatures
in the corresponding genes, were most conspicuous. Down-regulation in cerebral
malaria seems to rely on AhRF, GABP and HIF1 hypoxia transcription factors. ARG1,
BPI, CD163, IFI27, HP and TNFAIP6 transcript levels correlated positively with
lactatemia, and negatively with hemoglobin concentrations.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in gene expression profile reflect distinct
immunopathological mechanisms of P. falciparum infection. They emerge as
potential prognostic markers for early therapeutic measures and need to be
validated further. FUND: This work was supported by a grant of the NGFN
(Nationales Genomforschungsnetz 01GS0114) and by a CNPq (Conselho Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Brazil) PhD scholarship for A. B. W.
