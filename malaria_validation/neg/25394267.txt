Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly human malarial parasite, responsible for
an estimated 207 million cases of disease and 627,000 deaths in 2012. Recent
studies reveal that the parasite actively regulates a large fraction of its genes
throughout its replicative cycle inside human red blood cells and that
epigenetics plays an important role in this precise gene regulation. Here, we
discuss recent advances in our understanding of three aspects of epigenetic
regulation in P. falciparum: changes in histone modifications, nucleosome
occupancy and the three-dimensional genome structure. We compare these three
aspects of the P. falciparum epigenome to those of other eukaryotes, and show
that large-scale compartmentalization is particularly important in determining
histone decomposition and gene regulation in P. falciparum. We conclude by
presenting a gene regulation model for P. falciparum that combines the described 
epigenetic factors, and by discussing the implications of this model for the
future of malaria research.
