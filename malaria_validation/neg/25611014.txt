In this issue of the journal, Brima et al. report thought-provoking research
providing a potential evolutionary rationale whereby natural selection might have
preserved genes that predispose to metabolic syndrome. When CD-1 mice were fed a 
high fat diet, this induced metabolic changes characteristic of metabolic
syndrome. In addition, the high fat diet provided substantial protection from
lethality due to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. The authors hypothesize that
the same genes predispose to both metabolic syndrome and protection against
infectious disease. Thus, the selective advantage of not dying from infectious
disease implicitly provides selective pressure predisposing to metabolic
syndrome. This hypothesis follows a similar line of reasoning that has provided
explanations for the survival of the HbS mutation for sickle cell disease and
renal disease-associated genetic variants in apolipoprotein L1. Variants in these
two genes provide protection from malaria and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,
respectively.
