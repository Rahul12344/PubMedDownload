Heme metabolism is central to blood-stage infection by the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites retain a heme biosynthesis pathway but do not
require its activity during infection of heme-rich erythrocytes, where they can
scavenge host heme to meet metabolic needs. Nevertheless, heme biosynthesis in
parasite-infected erythrocytes can be potently stimulated by exogenous
5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), resulting in accumulation of the phototoxic
intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Here we use photodynamic imaging, mass
spectrometry, parasite gene disruption, and chemical probes to reveal that
vestigial host enzymes in the cytoplasm of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes
contribute to ALA-stimulated heme biosynthesis and that ALA uptake depends on
parasite-established permeability pathways. We show that PPIX accumulation in
infected erythrocytes can be harnessed for antimalarial chemotherapy using
luminol-based chemiluminescence and combinatorial stimulation by low-dose
artemisinin to photoactivate PPIX to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen. This
photodynamic strategy has the advantage of exploiting host enzymes refractory to 
resistance-conferring mutations.
