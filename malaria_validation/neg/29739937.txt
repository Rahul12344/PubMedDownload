Pathogens compete for hosts through patterns of cross-protection conferred by
immune responses to antigens. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the var multigene
family encoding for the major blood-stage antigen PfEMP1 has evolved enormous
genetic diversity through ectopic recombination and mutation. With 50-60 var
genes per genome, it is unclear whether immune selection can act as a dominant
force in structuring var repertoires of local populations. The combinatorial
complexity of the var system remains beyond the reach of existing strain theory
and previous evidence for non-random structure cannot demonstrate immune
selection without comparison with neutral models. We develop two neutral models
that encompass malaria epidemiology but exclude competitive interactions between 
parasites. These models, combined with networks of genetic similarity, reveal
non-neutral strain structure in both simulated systems and an extensively sampled
population in Ghana. The unique population structure we identify underlies the
large transmission reservoir characteristic of highly endemic regions in Africa.
