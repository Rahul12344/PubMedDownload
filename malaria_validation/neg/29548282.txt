BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1.1.49) deficiency is
one of the most common X-linked recessive hereditary disorders in the world.
Primaquine (PQ) has been used for radical cure of P. vivax to prevent relapse.
Recently, it is also used to reduce P. falciparum gametocyte carriage to block
transmission. However, PQ metabolites oxidize hemoglobin and generate excessive
reactive oxygen species which can trigger acute hemolytic anemia in malaria
patients with inherited G6PD deficiency.
METHODS: A total of 252 blood samples collected from malaria patients in Myanmar 
were used in this study. G6PD variant was analysed by a multiplex allele specific
PCR kit, DiaPlexC™ G6PD Genotyping Kit [Asian type]. The accuracy of the
multiplex allele specific PCR was confirmed by sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: Prevalence and distribution of G6PD variants in 252 malaria patients in 
Myanmar were analysed. Six different types of G6PD allelic variants were
identified in 50 (7 females and 43 males) malaria patients. The predominant
variant was Mahidol (68%, 34/50), of which 91.2% (31/34) and 8.8% (3/34) were
males and females, respectively. Other G6PD variants including Kaiping (18%,
9/50), Viangchan (6%, 3/50), Mediterranean (4%, 2/50), Union (2%, 1/50) and
Canton (2%, 1/50) were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that more concern for proper and safe 
use of PQ as a radical cure of malaria in Myanmar is needed by combining G6PD
deficiency test before PQ prescription. Establishment of a follow-up system to
monitor potential PQ toxicity in malaria patients who are given PQ is also
required.
