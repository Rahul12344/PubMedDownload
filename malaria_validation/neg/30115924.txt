The widely used antimalarial combination therapy dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine
(DHA + PPQ) has failed in Cambodia. Here, we perform a genomic analysis that
reveals a rapid increase in the prevalence of novel mutations in the Plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT following DHA + PPQ
implementation. These mutations occur in parasites harboring the K13 C580Y
artemisinin resistance marker. By introducing PfCRT mutations into sensitive Dd2 
parasites or removing them from resistant Cambodian isolates, we show that the
H97Y, F145I, M343L, or G353V mutations each confer resistance to PPQ, albeit with
fitness costs for all but M343L. These mutations sensitize Dd2 parasites to
chloroquine, amodiaquine, and quinine. In Dd2 parasites, multicopy plasmepsin 2, 
a candidate molecular marker, is not necessary for PPQ resistance. Distended
digestive vacuoles were observed in pfcrt-edited Dd2 parasites but not in
Cambodian isolates. Our findings provide compelling evidence that emerging
mutations in PfCRT can serve as a molecular marker and mediator of PPQ
resistance.
