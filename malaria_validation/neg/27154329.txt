Malaria transmission relies on the successful development of Plasmodium parasites
in the Anopheles mosquito vector. Within the mosquito midgut, malaria parasites
encounter a resident bacterial flora and parasite-bacteria interactions modulate 
Plasmodium development. The mechanisms by which the bacteria interact with
malaria parasites are still unknown. The intestinal microbiota could regulate
immune signaling pathways or produce bacterial compounds that block Plasmodium
development. In this study, we characterized Escherichia coli strains previously 
isolated from the Anopheles mosquito midgut and investigated the putative role of
two E. coli clones, 444ST95 and 351ST73, on parasite development. Sporogonic
development was significantly impacted by exposure to clone 444ST95 whereas
prevalence and intensity of infection were not different in mosquitoes challenged
with 351ST73 as compared to control mosquitoes. This result indicates midgut
bacteria exhibit intra-specific variation in their ability to inhibit Plasmodium 
development. Expression patterns of immune genes differed between mosquitoes
challenged with 444ST95 and 351ST73 and examination of the luminal midgut surface
by transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct effects of bacterial
exposure on midgut epithelial cells. The 444ST95 clone strongly affected mosquito
survival and parasite development and this could be associated to the Hemolysin F
or other toxins released by the bacteria. Further studies will be needed to
decipher the virulence factors and to determine their contribution to the
observed phenotype of the 444ST95E. coli strain that belongs to the
epidemiological ST95 clonal group responsible for extra intestinal infections in 
human and other animals.
