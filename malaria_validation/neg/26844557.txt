BACKGROUND: The validation of drug targets in malaria and other human diseases
remains a highly difficult and laborious process. In the vast majority of cases, 
highly specific small molecule tools to inhibit a proteins function in vivo are
simply not available. Additionally, the use of genetic tools in the analysis of
malarial pathways is challenging. These issues result in difficulties in
specifically modulating a hypothetical drug target's function in vivo.
OBJECTIVE: The current "toolbox" of various methods and techniques to identify a 
protein's function in vivo remains very limited and there is a pressing need for 
expansion. New approaches are urgently required to support target validation in
the drug discovery process.
METHOD: Oligomerisation is the natural assembly of multiple copies of a single
protein into one object and this self-assembly is present in more than half of
all protein structures. Thus, oligomerisation plays a central role in the
generation of functional biomolecules. A key feature of oligomerisation is that
the oligomeric interfaces between the individual parts of the final assembly are 
highly specific. However, these interfaces have not yet been systematically
explored or exploited to dissect biochemical pathways in vivo.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This mini review will describe the current state of the
antimalarial toolset as well as the potentially druggable malarial pathways. A
specific focus is drawn to the initial efforts to exploit oligomerisation
surfaces in drug target validation. As alternative to the conventional methods,
Protein Interference Assay (PIA) can be used for specific distortion of the
target protein function and pathway assessment in vivo.
