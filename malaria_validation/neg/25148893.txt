BACKGROUND: The burden of malaria infection in the modern world remains
significant. Specific changes in the relative proportions of malaria vector
mosquitoes, Maculipennis Complex species, in the south of Western Siberia over
the past 25 years of the 20th century have attracted wide attention as an
indicator of their dynamic geographical distribution. In Eurasia, studies of
fluctuations in the borders of areas occupied by sibling species of this complex,
as well as their relative proportions in the areas where they are sympatric are
epidemiologically important.
METHODS: Species identity and chromosomal polymorphisms within each population
were defined by cytogenetic analysis of polytene chromosomes of third- and
fourth-instar larvae and adult females of Anopheles mosquitoes collected over the
period from 1973 to 2012. A total of 37 Anopheles samples (3,757 specimens) from 
the Ukraine, European Russia and the Urals were studied. To identify An. messeae 
s.l. cryptic species A and B, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms of the second internal transcribed spacer rRNA genes
sequences (ITS2 PCR-RFLP) were used.
RESULTS: An. maculipennis s.s. is expanding to the northeast at a speed of
approximately 30 km per year. In 2008 or 2009, this species appeared in the
Southern Urals. The emergence of An. maculipennis in this region was accompanied 
by a decrease in the proportions of An. messeae A and An. beklemishevi and by an 
increase in the proportion of An. messeae B within An. messeae s.l. It is highly 
likely that the southwestern border of An. beklemishevi distribution area could
shift in the same direction as expanding area of An. maculipennis.
CONCLUSIONS: The geographical distribution of the Palaearctic mosquito species of
the Maculipennis Complex is undergoing a gradual shift. Changes detected in the
species distribution can be considered as a component of the biocenotic process
triggered by global warming. Both the warming itself and consequent expansion of 
An. maculipennis s.s. to the northeast, followed by changes in the species
composition of Anopheles as well as their relative proportions and fluctuations
in the species areas, exacerbate the epidemiology of malaria infection in
Eurasia.
