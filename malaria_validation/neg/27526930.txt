The number of protein folds in nature is limited, thus is not surprising that
proteins with the same fold are able to exert different functions. The cysteine
protease inhibitors that adopt an immunoglobulin- like fold (Ig-ICPs) are
inhibitors encoded in bacteria and protozoan parasites. Structural studies
indicate that these inhibitors resemble the structure of archetypical proteins
with an Ig fold, like antibodies, cadherins or cell receptors. The structure of
Ig-ICPs from four different protozoan parasites clearly shows the presence of
three loops that form part of a protein-ligand interaction surface that resembles
the antigen binding sites of antibodies. Thus, Ig-ICPs bind to different cysteine
proteases using a tripartite mechanism in which their BC, DE and FG loops are
responsible for the main interactions with the target cysteine protease. Ig-ICPs 
from different protozoan parasites regulate the enzymatic activity of host or
parasite's proteases and thus regulate virulence and pathogenesis.
