Erratum for
    Malar J. 2018 Aug 7;17(1):286.

Following publication of the original article [1], it was flagged by one of the
authors that the name of the P. falciparum gene marker of artemisinin resistance 
'pfkelch13' was (incorrectly) written as "pfketch13", which was repeated seven
times in different parts of the published paper.
