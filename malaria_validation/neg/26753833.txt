BACKGROUND: Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) and haemoglobin C (HbC) are both caused by
point mutations in the beta globin gene, and both offer substantial malaria
protection. Despite the fact that the blood disorder caused by homozygosity for
HbC is much less severe than that caused by homozygosity for HbS (sickle cell
anaemia), it is the sickle mutation which has come to dominate many old-world
malarious regions, whilst HbC is highly restricted in its geographical
distribution. It has been suggested that this discrepancy may be due to sickle
cell heterozygotes enjoying a higher level of malaria protection than
heterozygotes for HbC. A higher fitness of sickle cell heterozygotes relative to 
HbC heterozygotes could certainly have allowed the sickle cell allele to spread
more rapidly. However, observations that carrying either HbC or HbS enhances an
individual's capacity to transmit malaria parasites to mosquitoes could also shed
light on this conundrum.
METHODS: A population genetic model was used to investigate the evolutionary
consequences of the strength of malaria selection being correlated with either
HbS frequency or HbC frequency.
RESULTS: If the selection pressure from malaria is positively correlated with the
frequency of either HbS or HbC, it is easier for HbS to succeed in the
competitive interaction between the two alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: A feedback process whereby the presence of variant haemoglobins
increases the level of malaria selection in a population could have contributed
to the global success of HbS relative to HbC, despite the former's higher blood
disorder cost.
