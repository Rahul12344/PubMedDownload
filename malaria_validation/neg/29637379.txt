Chitin-metabolizing products are of high industrial relevance in current scenario
due to their wide biological applications, relatively lower cost, greater
abundance, and sustainable supply. Chitooligosaccharides have remarkably wide
spectrum of applications in therapeutics such as antitumor agents,
immunomodulators, drug delivery, gene therapy, wound dressings, as chitinase
inhibitors to prevent malaria. Hypocholesterolemic and antimicrobial activities
of chitooligosaccharides make them a molecule of choice for food industry, and
their functional profile depends on the physicochemical characteristics.
Recently, chitin-based nanomaterials are also gaining tremendous importance in
biomedical and agricultural applications. Crystallinity and insolubility of
chitin imposes a major hurdle in the way of polymer utilization. Chemical
production processes are known to produce chitooligosaccharides with variable
degree of polymerization and properties along with ecological concerns.
Biological production routes mainly involve chitinases, chitosanases, and
chitin-binding proteins. Development of bio-catalytic production routes for
chitin will not only enhance the production of commercially viable
chitooligosaccharides with defined molecular properties but will also provide a
means to combat marine pollution with value addition.
