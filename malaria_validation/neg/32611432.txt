BACKGROUND: Anopheles mosquitoes are the vectors of malaria, one of the most
important infectious diseases in the tropics. More than 500 Anopheles species
have been described worldwide, and more than 30 are considered a public health
problem. In Honduras, information on the distribution of Anopheles spp. and its
genetic diversity is scarce. This study aimed to describe the distribution and
genetic diversity of Anopheles mosquitoes in Honduras.
METHODS: Mosquitoes were captured in 8 locations in 5 malaria endemic departments
during 2019. Two collection methods were used. Adult anophelines were captured
outdoors using CDC light traps and by aspiration of mosquitoes at rest.
Morphological identification was performed using taxonomic keys. Genetic analyses
included the sequencing of a partial region of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene
(cox1) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2).
RESULTS: A total of 1320 anophelines were collected and identified through
morphological keys. Seven Anopheles species were identified. Anopheles albimanus 
was the most widespread and abundant species (74.02%). To confirm the
morphological identification of the specimens, 175 and 122 sequences were
obtained for cox1 and ITS2, respectively. Both markers confirmed the
morphological identification. cox1 showed a greater nucleotide diversity than
ITS2 in all species. High genetic diversity was observed within the populations
of An. albimanus while An. darlingi proved to be a highly homogeneous population.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed clustering patterns in An. darlingi and An. neivai
in relation to specimens from South America. New sequences for An. crucians, An. 
vestitipennis and An. neivai are reported in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the distribution and genetic diversity of Anopheles
species in endemic areas of malaria transmission in Honduras. According to our
results, both taxonomic and molecular approaches are useful tools in the
identification of anopheline mosquitoes. However, both molecular markers differ
in their ability to detect intraspecific genetic diversity. These results provide
supporting data for a better understanding of the distribution of malaria vectors
in Honduras.
