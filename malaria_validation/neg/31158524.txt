Developing ultrasensitive methods capable of detecting submicroscopic
parasitemia-a challenge that persists in low transmission areas, asymptomatic
carriers, and patients showing recrudescence-is vital to achieving malaria
eradication. Nucleic acid amplification techniques offer improved analytical
sensitivity but are limited by the number of copies of the amplification targets.
Herein, we perform a novel genome mining approach to identify a pair of identical
multirepeat sequences (IMRSs) that constitute 170 and 123 copies in the
Plasmodium falciparum genome and explore their potential as primers for PCR.
Real-time quantitative PCR analyses have shown the ability of P. falciparum IMRSs
to amplify as low as 2.54 fg of P. falciparum genomic DNA (approximately 0.1
parasite), with a striking 100-fold increase in detection limit when compared
with P. falciparum 18S rRNA (251.4 fg; approximately 10 parasites). Validation
with clinical samples from malaria-endemic regions has shown 6.70 ± 1.66 cycle
better detection threshold in terms of Ct value for P. falciparum IMRSs, with
approximately 100% sensitivity and specificity. Plasmodium falciparum IMRS assays
are also capable of detecting submicroscopic infections in asymptomatic samples. 
To summarize, this approach of initiating amplification at multiple loci across
the genome and generating more products with increased analytical sensitivity is 
different from classic approaches amplifying multicopy genes or tandem repeats.
This can serve as a platform technology to develop advanced diagnostics for
various pathogens.
