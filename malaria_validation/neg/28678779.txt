The lifestyle of intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, is
intimately connected to that of their host, primarily for nutrient supply.
Nutrients act not only as primary sources of energy but also as regulators of
gene expression, metabolism and growth, through various signalling networks that 
enable cells to sense and adapt to varying environmental conditions. Canonical
nutrient-sensing pathways are presumed to be absent from the causative agent of
malaria, Plasmodium, thus raising the question of whether these parasites can
sense and cope with fluctuations in host nutrient levels. Here we show that
Plasmodium blood-stage parasites actively respond to host dietary calorie
alterations through rearrangement of their transcriptome accompanied by
substantial adjustment of their multiplication rate. A kinome analysis combined
with chemical and genetic approaches identified KIN as a critical regulator that 
mediates sensing of nutrients and controls a transcriptional response to the host
nutritional status. KIN shares homology with SNF1/AMPKα, and yeast
complementation studies suggest that it is part of a functionally conserved
cellular energy-sensing pathway. Overall, these findings reveal a key parasite
nutrient-sensing mechanism that is critical for modulating parasite replication
and virulence.
