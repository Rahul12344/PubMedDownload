We identified 480 persons with positive thick smears for asexual Plasmodium
falciparum parasites, of whom 454 had positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for 
the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) product of the hrp2 gene and 26 had negative 
tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the histidine-rich
repeat region of that gene was negative in one-half (10/22) of false-negative
specimens available, consistent with spontaneous deletion. False-negative RDTs
were found only in persons with asymptomatic infections, and multiplicities of
infection (MOIs) were lower in persons with false-negative RDTs (both P < 0.001).
These results show that parasites that fail to produce HRP2 can cause patent
bloodstream infections and false-negative RDT results. The importance of these
observations is likely to increase as malaria control improves, because lower
MOIs are associated with false-negative RDTs and false-negative RDTs are more
frequent in persons with asymptomatic infections. These findings suggest that the
use of HRP2-based RDTs should be reconsidered.
