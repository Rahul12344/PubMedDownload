The development of new drugs is one strategy for malaria control. Biochemical
pathways localised in the apicoplast of the parasite, such as the synthesis of
isoprenic precursors, are excellent targets because they are different or absent 
in the human host. Isoprenoids are a large and highly diverse group of natural
products with many functions and their synthesis is essential for the parasite's 
survival. During the last few years, the genes, enzymes, intermediates and
mechanisms of this biosynthetic route have been elucidated. In this review, we
comment on some aspects of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and discuss the
presence of diverse isoprenic products such as dolichol, ubiquinone, carotenoids,
menaquinone and isoprenylated proteins, which are biosynthesised during the
intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum.
