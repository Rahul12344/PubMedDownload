Epigenetic manipulation of host cells by intracellular pathogens has become
increasingly evident. Lecoeur et al. show us how Leishmania amazonensis inhibits 
macrophage inflammasomes by modifying histone H3 activation marks on
NF-ÎºB-associated gene promoters that increase the expression of inhibitors and
downmodulates activators of this pathway.
