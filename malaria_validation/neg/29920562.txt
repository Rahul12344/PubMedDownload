Malaria continues to be one of mankind's most devastating diseases despite the
many and varied efforts to combat it. Indispensable for malaria elimination and
eventual eradication is the development of effective vaccines. Controlled human
malaria infection (CHMI) is an invaluable tool for vaccine efficacy assessment
and investigation of early immunological and molecular responses against
Plasmodium falciparum infection. Here, we investigated gene expression changes
following CHMI using RNA-Seq. Peripheral blood samples were collected in
Bagamoyo, Tanzania, from ten adults who were injected intradermally (ID) with
2.5x104 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (SanariaÂ®
PfSPZ Challenge). A total of 2,758 genes were identified as differentially
expressed following CHMI. Transcriptional changes were most pronounced on day 5
after inoculation, during the clinically silent liver phase. A secondary
analysis, grouping the volunteers according to their prepatent period duration,
identified 265 genes whose expression levels were linked to time of blood stage
parasitemia detection. Gene modules associated with these 265 genes were linked
to regulation of transcription, cell cycle, phosphatidylinositol signaling and
erythrocyte development. Our study showed that in malaria pre-exposed volunteers,
parasite prepatent period in each individual is linked to magnitude and timing of
early gene expression changes after ID CHMI.
