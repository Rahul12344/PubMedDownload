Genetic modifiers of anemia in Plasmodium falciparum infection and sickle cell
disease (SCD) are not fully known. Both conditions are associated with oxidative 
stress, hemolysis and anemia. The CYB5R3 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase 3, 
which converts methemoglobin to hemoglobin through oxidation of NADH.
CYB5R3c.350C > G encoding CYB5R3T117S , the most frequent recognized
African-specific polymorphism, does not have known functional significance, but
its high allele frequency (23% in African Americans) suggests a selection
advantage. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is essential for protection
from oxidants; its African-polymorphic X-linked A+ and A- alleles, and other
variants with reduced activity, coincide with endemic malaria distribution,
suggesting protection from lethal infection. We examined the association of
CYB5R3c.350C > G with severe anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dL) in the context of G6PD
A+ and A- status among 165 Zambian children with malaria. CYB5R3c.350C > G
offered protection against severe malarial anemia in children without G6PD
deficiency (G6PD wild type or A+/A- heterozygotes) (odds ratio 0.29, P = .022)
but not in G6PD A+ or A- hemizygotes/homozygotes. We also examined the
relationship of CYB5R3c.350C > G with hemoglobin concentration among 267 children
and 321 adults and adolescents with SCD in the US and UK and found higher
hemoglobin in SCD patients without G6PD deficiency (β = 0.29, P = .022 children; 
β = 0.33, P = .004 adults). Functional studies in SCD erythrocytes revealed
mildly lower activity of native CYB5R3T117S compared to wildtype CYB5R3 and
higher NADH/NAD+ ratios. In conclusion, CYB5R3c.350C > G appears to ameliorate
anemia severity in malaria and SCD patients without G6PD deficiency, possibly
accounting for CYB5R3c.350C > G selection and its high prevalence.
