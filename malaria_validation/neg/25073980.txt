BACKGROUND: Proteins from the ABC family (ATP-binding cassette) represent the
largest known group of efflux pumps, responsible for transporting specific
molecules across lipid membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In
arthropods they have been shown to play a role in insecticide defense/resistance.
The presence of ABC transporters and their possible association with insecticide 
transport have not yet been investigated in the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, the
major vector of human malaria in the Middle East and South Asian regions. Here we
investigated the presence and role of ABCs in transport of permethrin insecticide
in a susceptible strain of this mosquito species.
METHODS: To identify ABC transporter genes we obtained a transcriptome from
untreated larvae of An. stephensi and then compared it with the annotated
transcriptome of Anopheles gambiae. To analyse the association between ABC
transporters and permethrin we conducted bioassays with permethrin alone and in
combination with an ABC inhibitor, and then we investigated expression profiles
of the identified genes in larvae exposed to permethrin.
RESULTS: Bioassays showed an increased mortality of mosquitoes when permethrin
was used in combination with the ABC-transporter inhibitor. Genes for ABC
transporters were detected in the transcriptome, and five were selected
(AnstABCB2, AnstABCB3, AnstABCB4, AnstABCmember6 and AnstABCG4). An increased
expression in one of them (AnstABCG4) was observed in larvae exposed to the LD50 
dose of permethrin. Contrary to what was found in other insect species, no
up-regulation was observed in the AnstABCB genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time the involvement of ABC
transporters in larval defense against permethrin in An. stephensi and, more in
general, confirm the role of ABC transporters in insecticide defense. The
differences observed with previous studies highlight the need of further research
as, despite the growing number of studies on ABC transporters in insects, the
heterogeneity of the results available at present does not allow us to infer
general trends in ABC transporter-insecticide interactions.
