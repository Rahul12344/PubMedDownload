Background: The national treatment guidelines of Nepal have adopted Artemisinin
Combination Therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
malaria since 2004. Emergence of Artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong
Sub-region (GMS) and beyond may become a threat for Nepal as well. The main
objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial
drug artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated P. falciparum infected patients at 
health centers/hospitals treated over the period of 2 years (2013-2014).
Methods: Giemsa stained thick and thin smears, prepared from uncomplicated
falciparum malaria patients who visited the selected sentinel sites in Nepal
during 2013 to 2014 and met the inclusion criteria that included parasitemia
(1000-10,000 /μL of blood), were evaluated until 28 days after ACTs treatment,
following a World Health Organization (WHO) therapeutic efficacy protocol. Based 
on the re-occurrence of fever and resurge in parasitemia, the study patients were
classified as resistant or susceptible. Blood specimens on filter papers were
further analyzed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), specifically for the K13
propeller gene mutation (a recently identified molecular marker for ACT
resistance).
Results: A total of 56,013 suspected malaria cases were screened for this study. 
Of which, 120 (0.21%) were infected with falciparum malaria. Out of 120, 28 cases
of P. falciparum (28/120; 23.33%) were enrolled in the study, of which 24 cases
completed the post-treatment follow up for 28 days. Only one case out of 24 (4%) 
was identified as a late treatment failure (LTF). K13 mutation, a proxy indicator
for ACT resistance in parasites, was not detected on the day 1, which indicates
resistance had not yet reached the molecular level.
Conclusion: Only one case of late treatment failure was identified in this study.
ACT combination using artemether-lumefantrine was still effective for the
treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nepal. A close monitoring and
supervision for ACT resistance is essential for future malaria treatment in
Nepal.
