Telomere repeat-binding factors (TRFs) are essential components of the molecular 
machinery that regulates telomere function. TRFs are widely conserved across
eukaryotes and bind duplex telomere repeats via a characteristic MYB-type domain.
Here, we identified the telomere repeat-binding protein PfTRZ in the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a member of the Alveolate phylum for which TRFs
have not been described so far. PfTRZ lacks an MYB domain and binds telomere
repeats via a C2H2-type zinc finger domain instead. In vivo, PfTRZ binds with
high specificity to the telomeric tract and to interstitial telomere repeats
upstream of subtelomeric virulence genes. Conditional depletion experiments
revealed that PfTRZ regulates telomere length homeostasis and is required for
efficient cell cycle progression. Intriguingly, we found that PfTRZ also binds to
and regulates the expression of 5S rDNA genes. Combined with detailed
phylogenetic analyses, our findings identified PfTRZ as a remote functional
homologue of the basic transcription factor TFIIIA, which acquired a new function
in telomere maintenance early in the apicomplexan lineage. Our work sheds
unexpected new light on the evolution of telomere repeat-binding proteins and
paves the way for dissecting the presumably divergent mechanisms regulating
telomere functionality in one of the most deadly human pathogens.
