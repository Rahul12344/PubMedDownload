Eukaryotic pathogens must survive in different hosts, respond to changing
environments, and exploit specialized niches to propagate. Plasmodium parasites
cause human malaria during bloodstream infections, where they must persist long
enough to be transmitted. Parasites have evolved diverse strategies of variant
gene expression that control critical biological processes of blood-stage
infections, including antigenic variation, erythrocyte invasion, innate immune
evasion, and nutrient acquisition, as well as life-cycle transitions. Epigenetic 
mechanisms within the parasite are being elucidated, with discovery of epigenomic
marks associated with gene silencing and activation, and the identification of
epigenetic regulators and chromatin proteins that are required for the switching 
and maintenance of gene expression. Here, we review the key epigenetic processes 
that facilitate transition through the parasite life cycle and epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms utilized by Plasmodium parasites to survive changing
environments and consider epigenetic switching in the context of the outcome of
human infections.
