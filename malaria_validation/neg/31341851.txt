Background: Some mosquito species which belong to the Culex. pipiens complex are 
primary vectors for West Nile virus, Sindbis, Dirofilaria immitis, and many
arboviruses. Knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium
channel (VGSC) gene of Cx. pipiens that is inherited, is one of the important
threats for the efficacy of pyrethroids insecticides. Knockdown resistance (kdr) 
mutation, L1014F, is a well-defined mechanism of resistance to pyrethroids and
DDT in many insect species. The aim of study was to determine the mechanisms of
Insecticide resistance in this species.
Methods: Specimens of Cx. pipiens, the major vector of West Nile virus, were
obtained in Tehran, Iran by collecting larvae from polluted wastewater in Qarchak
of Tehran. In 2016 Insecticide susceptibility tests were performed according to
WHO methods with deltamethrin 0.05%. We focused on determination of this point
mutation in the VGSC gene of Cx. pipiens by Real-time PCR.
Results: Our results revealed high levels of resistance to deltamethrin 0.05%.
The lethal times i.e. LT50 and LT90 for deltamethrin were 2.1530 and 8.5117 h
respectively. The result of Real-time PCR confirmed the presence of resistant
genotype in all the members of tested population. This study is the first report 
on kdr genotyping of Cx. pipiens from Tehran and our results on the VGSC gene in 
position L1014F confirmed the TTA to TTT nucleotide change.
Conclusion: This finding will provide a clue for management of insecticide
resistance in mosquito which are vectors of arboviruses and decision for
replacement of novel approach for vector control.
