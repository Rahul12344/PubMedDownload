The current epidemic of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast 
Asia is the result of a soft selective sweep involving at least 20 independent
kelch13 mutations. In a large global survey, we find that kelch13 mutations which
cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We
show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally, and that kelch13
shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in
Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which
cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, kelch13 is not currently undergoing
strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of variations that could
potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are
that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on
kelch13 data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for
local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly
between geographical regions.
