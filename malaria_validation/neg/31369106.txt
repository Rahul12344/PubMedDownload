BACKGROUND: Malaria control efforts in Sudan rely heavily on case management. In 
2004, health authorities adopted artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)
for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. However, some recent surveys have
reported ACT failure and a prevalent irrational malaria treatment practice. Here 
we examine whether the widespread use of ACT and failure to adhere to national
guidelines have led to the evolution of drug resistance genes.
METHODS: We genotyped known drug resistance markers (Pfcrt, Pfmdr-1, Pfdhfr,
Pfdhps, Pfk13 propeller) and their flanking microsatellites among Plasmodium
falciparum isolates obtained between 2009 and 2016 in different geographical
regions in Sudan. Data were then compared with published findings pre-ACT
(1992-2003).
RESULTS: A high prevalence of Pfcrt76T, Pfmdr-1-86Y, Pfdhfr51I, Pfdhfr108N,
Pfdhps37G was observed in all regions, while no Pfk13 mutations were detected.
Compared with pre-ACT data, Pfcrt-76T and Pfmdr-1-86Y have decayed, while
Pfdhfr-51I, Pfdhfr-108N and Pfdhps-437G strengthened. Haplotypes Pfcrt-CVIET,
Pfmdr-1-NFSND/YFSND, Pfdhfr-ICNI and Pfdhps-SGKAA predominated in all sites.
Microsatellites flanking drug resistance genes showed lower diversity than
neutral ones, signifying high ACT pressure/selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of P. falciparum drug resistance genes in Sudan matches
the drug deployment pattern. Regular monitoring of these genes, coupled with
clinical response, should be considered to combat the spread of ACT resistance.
