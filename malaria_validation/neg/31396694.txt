Artesunate (ART) is the derivative of artemisinin isolated from the traditional
Chinese medicine qinghao. Although several studies reported the efficiency of
artesunate in the treatment of malaria, inhibiting fibroblasts and collagen
synthesis, the association between artesunate and scar formation is unclear. The 
research was designed to study the significance of artesunate (ART) on the
expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and small mother against
decapentaplegic (SMAD3) in rabbit's ear hypertrophic scar model. Twenty-four New 
Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into six groups: control group,
matrix group, low-concentration artesunate group (0.48%), medium-concentration
artesunate group (0.96%), high-concentration artesunate group (1.92%) and
silicone gel group. Punched defects were established on each rabbit's ear which
resulted in a hypertrophic scar. On the 28th day, topical artesunate creams were 
applied twice a day except on the control group. On the 56th day, scar samples
were collected for histopathology and immunoassay. Hematoxylin and eosin
staining, Van Gieson staining, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis
were done. Amongst the six groups, findings showed that the medium-concentration 
artesunate group (0.92%) efficiently decreased hypertrophic scar formation and
significantly reduced fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. The results had also
shown a decrease in the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and
declined small signal mother against decapentaplegic (Smad3). The overall study
shows efficacy and mechanism of artesunate. It concluded that the medium
concentration of artesunate (0.92%) could be an effective therapeutic agent for
hypertrophic scars.
