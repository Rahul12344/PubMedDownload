Wolbachia surface protein induces innate immune responses in mosquito cells.

Pinto SB, Mariconti M, Bazzocchi C, Bandi C, Sinkins SP.

BACKGROUND: Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria are capable of inducing chronic
upregulation of insect immune genes in some situations and this phenotype may
influence the transmission of important insect-borne pathogens. However the
molecules involved in these interactions have not been characterized.
RESULTS: Here we show that recombinant Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) stimulates
increased transcription of immune genes in mosquito cells derived from the
mosquito Anopheles gambiae, which is naturally uninfected with Wolbachia; at
least two of the upregulated genes, TEP1 and APL1, are known to be important in
Plasmodium killing in this species. When cells from Aedes albopictus, which is
naturally Wolbachia-infected, were challenged with WSP lower levels of
upregulation were observed than for the An. gambiae cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We have found that WSP is a strong immune elicitor in a naturally
Wolbachia-uninfected mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae) while a milder elicitor
in a naturally-infected species (Aedes albopictus). Since the WSP of a mosquito
non-native (nematode) Wolbachia strain was used, these data suggest that there is
a generalized tolerance to WSP in Ae. albopictus.
