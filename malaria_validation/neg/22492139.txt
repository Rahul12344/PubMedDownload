Molecular tools to distinguish strains of Plasmodium vivax are important for
studying the epidemiology of malaria transmission. Two sets of markers-tandem
repeat (TR) polymorphisms and MSP3α-were used to study Plasmodium vivax in
patients in the Peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos. Of 110 patients, 90 distinct
haplotypes were distinguished using 9 TR markers. An MSP3α polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) using HhaI and AluI 
revealed 8 and 9 profiles, respectively, and 36 profiles when analyzed in
combination. Combining TR and PCR-RFLP markers, 101 distinct molecular profiles
were distinguished among these 110 patients. Nine TR markers arrayed along a 100 
kB stretch of a P. vivax chromosome containing the gene for circumsporozoite
protein showed non-linear linkage disequilibrium (I(SA) = 0.03, P = 0.001). These
findings demonstrate the potential use of TR markers for molecular epidemiology
studies.
