BACKGROUND: Until very recently, Anopheles were considered naturally unable to
host Wolbachia, an intracellular bacterium regarded as a potential biological
control tool. Their detection in field populations of Anopheles gambiae sensu
lato, suggests that they may also be present in many more anopheline species than
previously thought.
RESULTS: Here, is reported the first discovery of natural Wolbachia infections in
Anopheles funestus populations from Senegal, the second main malaria vector in
Africa. Molecular phylogeny analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene revealed at least
two Wolbachia genotypes which were named wAnfu-A and wAnfu-B, according to their 
close relatedness to the A and B supergroups. Furthermore, both wAnfu genotypes
displayed high proximity with wAnga sequences previously described from the An.
gambiae complex, with only few nucleotide differences. However, the low
prevalence of infection, together with the difficulties encountered for
detection, whatever method used, highlights the need to develop an effective and 
sensitive Wolbachia screening method dedicated to anopheline.
CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of natural Wolbachia infection in An. funestus,
another major malaria vector, may overcome the main limitation of using a
Wolbachia-based approach to control malaria through population suppression and/or
replacement.
