The knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) is an exported parasite
protein and the major component of infected erythrocytes by Plasmodium
falciparum. P. falciparum histidine-rich protein-1 (PfHRP-1) is docked by KAHRP, 
which this interaction plays a significant role in cytoadherence of the malaria
protozoan to erythrocytes and pathogenicity. The most polymorphic region of the
PfHRP-1 is the C-terminal of decapeptide repeat domain (region III). The main
objective of this study was to explore the genetic diversity at the region III of
KAHRP in P. falciparum isolates from Burundi. In the present study, the nested
PCR was performed for the amplification of the coding gene (kahrp gene) for
region III in 35 P. falciparum isolates from Burundi. The nested PCR products of 
seven randomly selected isolates were purified and then sequenced. As the result,
three allelic forms (340 bp, 370 bp, and 400 bp) were seen at the C-terminal
domain of kahrp gene. The existence of multiple alleles of the kahrp gene
revealed the presence of different P. falciparum strains in Burundi. It is
suggested that the results could be useful in designing and the improvement of
targeted therapy agents for falciparum malaria.
