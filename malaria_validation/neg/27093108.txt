The frequency of Candida infections is currently rising, and thus adversely
impacting global health. The situation is exacerbated by azole resistance
developed by fungal pathogens. Candida tropicalis is an opportunistic pathogen
that causes candidiasis, for example, in immune-compromised individuals, cancer
patients, and those who undergo organ transplantation. It is a member of the
non-albicans group of Candida that are known to be azole-resistant, and is
frequently seen in individuals being treated for cancers, HIV-infection, and
those who underwent bone marrow transplantation. Although the genome of C.
tropicalis was sequenced in 2009, the genome annotation has not been supported by
experimental validation. In the present study, we have carried out proteomics
profiling of C. tropicalis using high-resolution Fourier transform mass
spectrometry. We identified 2743 proteins, thus mapping nearly 44% of the
computationally predicted protein-coding genes with peptide level evidence. In
addition to identifying 2591 proteins in the cell lysate of this yeast, we also
analyzed the proteome of the conditioned media of C. tropicalis culture and
identified several unique secreted proteins among a total of 780 proteins. By
subjecting the mass spectrometry data derived from cell lysate and conditioned
media to proteogenomic analysis, we identified 86 novel genes, 12 novel exons,
and corrected 49 computationally-predicted gene models. To our knowledge, this is
the first high-throughput proteomics study of C. tropicalis validating predicted 
protein coding genes and refining the current genome annotation. The findings may
prove useful in future global health efforts to fight against Candida infections.
