African apes harbor at least twelve Plasmodium species, some of which have been a
source of human infection. It is now well established that Plasmodium falciparum 
emerged following the transmission of a gorilla parasite, perhaps within the last
10,000 years, while Plasmodium vivax emerged earlier from a parasite lineage that
infected humans and apes in Africa before the Duffy-negative mutation eliminated 
the parasite from humans there. Compared to their ape relatives, both human
parasites have greatly reduced genetic diversity and an excess of nonsynonymous
mutations, consistent with severe genetic bottlenecks followed by rapid
population expansion. A putative new Plasmodium species widespread in
chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos places the origin of Plasmodium malariae in
Africa. Here, we review what is known about the origins and evolutionary history 
of all human-infective Plasmodium species, the time and circumstances of their
emergence, and the diversity, host specificity, and zoonotic potential of their
ape counterparts.
