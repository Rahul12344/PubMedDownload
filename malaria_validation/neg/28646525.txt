BACKGROUND: The insect cuticle protects against environmental stresses such as
insecticides, physical injury, dehydration and pathogenic microorganisms.
Structural cuticular proteins (CPs) are the primary components of the cuticle,
and are of interest for physiology-based pest management methods. Anopheles
sinensis CPs are poorly characterised at present, and therefore we performed
whole-genome sequence analysis and re-analysed available transcriptome data to
identify potential insecticide resistance-associated CPs.
RESULTS: Genome analysis revealed 238 putative CPs belonging to 11 different
families; 136 proteins possessing a Rebers and Riddiford motif (CPR), 12 CPs
analogous to peritrophins with a single chitin-binding domain (CPAP1), eight CPs 
analogous to peritrophins with three chitin-binding domains (CPAP3), four
proteins with a 44 amino acid motif (CPF), five CPF-like (CPFL) proteins, nine
Tweedle proteins, three proteins of low complexity with alanine residues (CPLCA),
26 proteins of low complexity with conserved glycine residues (CPLCG), seven
proteins of low complexity with invariant W residues (CPLCW), 27 proteins of low 
complexity with proline residues (CPLCP), and one protein with two or three
copies of a C-X -C motif (CPCFC). Two CPs belonging to the CPR and CPAP3 families
were over-expressed in a deltamethrin-resistant strain.
CONCLUSION: These results establish an information framework for An. sinensis CPs
that provides a basis for further molecular research. © 2017 Society of Chemical
