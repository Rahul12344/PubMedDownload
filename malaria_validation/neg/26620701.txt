BACKGROUND: Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was recently identified as a
key receptor for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 mediating
sequestration of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in patients suffering from
severe malaria. Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) inhibits binding of P. falciparum to EPCR in
vitro and increased levels of sEPCR have been associated with the H3 haplotype of
the EPCR encoding PROCR gene. It has been hypothesized that elevated sEPCR
levels, possibly linked to the PROCR H3 genetic variant, may confer protection
against severe forms of malaria. This study determined the frequencies of PROCR
haplotypes H1-4 and plasma levels of sEPCR in a Tanzanian study population to
investigate a possible association with severe malaria.
METHODS: Study participants were children under 5 years of age admitted at the
Korogwe District Hospital (N = 143), and diagnosed as having severe malaria (N = 
52; including cerebral malaria N = 17), uncomplicated malaria (N = 24), or an
infection other than malaria (N = 67). In addition, blood samples from 71
children living in nearby villages were included. The SNPs defining the
haplotypes of PROCR gene were determined by post-PCR ligation detection
reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay.
RESULTS: Individuals carrying at least one H3 allele had significantly higher
levels of sEPCR than individuals with no H3 alleles (P < 0.001). No difference in
the frequency of H3 was found between the non-malaria patients, malaria patients 
or the village population (P > 0.1). Plasma levels of sEPCR differed between
these three groups, with higher sEPCR levels in the village population compared
to the hospitalized patients (P < 0.001) and higher levels in malaria patients
compared to non-malaria patients (P = 0.001). However, no differences were found 
in the distribution of H3 (P = 0.2) or levels of sEPCR (P = 0.8) between patients
diagnosed with severe and uncomplicated malaria.
CONCLUSION: Frequencies of SNPs determining PROCR haplotypes were in concordance 
with other African studies. The PROCR H3 allele was associated with higher levels
of sEPCR, confirming earlier findings, however, in this Tanzanian population;
neither PROCR haplotype nor level of sEPCR was associated with severe malaria,
however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.
