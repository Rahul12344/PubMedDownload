Despite its well-described safety and efficacy in the treatment of sickle cell
anemia (SCA) in high-income settings, hydroxyurea remains largely unavailable in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 75% of annual SCA births occur and many
comorbidities exist. Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea
(REACH, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01966731) is a prospective, Phase I/II open-label
trial of hydroxyurea designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and benefits
of hydroxyurea treatment for children with SCA in four sub-Saharan African
countries. Following comprehensive training of local research teams, REACH was
approved by local Ethics Committees and achieved full enrollment ahead of
projections with 635 participants enrolled over a 30-month period, despite half
of families living >12 km from their clinical site. At enrollment, study
participants (age 5.4 ± 2.4 years) had substantial morbidity, including a history
of vaso-occlusive pain (98%), transfusion (68%), malaria (85%), and stroke (6%). 
Significant differences in laboratory characteristics were noted across sites,
with lower hemoglobin concentrations (P < .01) in Angola (7.2 ± 1.0 g/dL) and the
DRC (7.0 ± 0.9 g/dL) compared to Kenya (7.4 ± 1.1 g/dL) and Uganda (7.5 ± 1.1
g/dL). Analysis of known genetic modifiers of SCA demonstrated a high frequency
of α-thalassemia (58.4% with at least a single α-globin gene deletion) and G6PD
deficiency (19.7% of males and 2.4% of females) across sites. The CAR β-globin
haplotype was present in 99% of participants. The full enrollment to REACH
confirms the feasibility of conducting high-quality SCA research in Africa; this 
study will provide vital information to guide safe and effective dosing of
hydroxyurea for children with SCA living in Africa.
