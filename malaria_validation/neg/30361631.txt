Parasites infect hosts in widely varying environments, encountering diverse
challenges for adaptation. To identify malaria parasite genes under locally
divergent selection across a large endemic region with a wide spectrum of
transmission intensity, genome sequences were obtained from 284 clinical
Plasmodium falciparum infections from four newly sampled locations in Senegal,
The Gambia, Mali and Guinea. Combining these with previous data from seven other 
sites in West Africa enabled a multi-population analysis to identify discrete
loci under varying local selection. A genome-wide scan showed the most
exceptional geographical divergence to be at the early gametocyte gene locus gdv1
which is essential for parasite sexual development and transmission. We
identified a major structural dimorphism with alternative 1.5 kb and 1.0 kb
sequence deletions at different positions of the 3'-intergenic region, in tight
linkage disequilibrium with the most highly differentiated single nucleotide
polymorphism, one of the alleles being very frequent in Senegal and The Gambia
but rare in the other locations. Long non-coding RNA transcripts were previously 
shown to include the entire antisense of the gdv1 coding sequence and the portion
of the intergenic region with allelic deletions, suggesting adaptive regulation
of parasite sexual development and transmission in response to local conditions.
