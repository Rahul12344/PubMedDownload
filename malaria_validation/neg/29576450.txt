Hereditary xerocytosis is thought to be a rare genetic condition characterized by
red blood cell (RBC) dehydration with mild hemolysis. RBC dehydration is linked
to reduced Plasmodium infection in vitro; however, the role of RBC dehydration in
protection against malaria in vivo is unknown. Most cases of hereditary
xerocytosis are associated with gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1, a
mechanically activated ion channel. We engineered a mouse model of hereditary
xerocytosis and show that Plasmodium infection fails to cause experimental
cerebral malaria in these mice due to the action of Piezo1 in RBCs and in
T cells. Remarkably, we identified a novel human gain-of-function PIEZO1 allele, 
E756del, present in a third of the African population. RBCs from individuals
carrying this allele are dehydrated and display reduced Plasmodium infection
in vitro. The existence of a gain-of-function PIEZO1 at such high frequencies is 
surprising and suggests an association with malaria resistance.
