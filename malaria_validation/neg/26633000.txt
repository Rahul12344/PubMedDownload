Genetic factors are likely to contribute to low severe malaria case fatality
rates in Melanesian populations, but association studies can be underpowered and 
may not provide plausible mechanistic explanations if significant associations
are detected. In preparation for a genome-wide association study, 29 candidate
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies >5% were
examined in a case-control study of 504 Papua New Guinean children with severe
malaria. In parallel, an immunological substudy was performed on convalescent
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cases and controls. Following
stimulation with a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 agonist, effector cytokines and
chemokines were assayed. The only significant genetic association observed
involved a nonsynonymous SNP (TLR1rs4833095) in the TLR1 gene. A recessive (TT)
genotype was associated with reduced odds of severe malaria of 0.52 (95%
confidence interval (0.29-0.90), P=0.006). Concentrations of pro-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor α were significantly higher
in severe malaria cases compared with healthy controls, but lower in children
with the protective recessive (TT) genotype. A genetic variant in TLR1 may
contribute to the low severe malaria case fatality rates in this region through a
reduced pro-inflammatory cellular phenotype.
