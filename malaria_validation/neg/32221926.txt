Trypanosomatids rely primarily on posttranscriptional mechanisms for the control 
of gene expression, with regulation of RNA processing, localization, degradation,
and translation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To determine the mechanisms by
which RBPs control gene expression in trypanosomatids, transcriptome-wide
identification of mRNA targets and mapping of the RNA-binding site is required.
Here we present our most current RIP-Seq (RNA immunoprecipitation followed by
high-throughput sequencing) protocol that we generally apply to elucidate
RNA/protein interactions in Trypanosoma brucei. The technique provides valuable
information about the workings of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) networks and
trypanosome gene expression mechanisms.
