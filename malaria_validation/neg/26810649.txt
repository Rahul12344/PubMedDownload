Lysine acetylation is a critical posttranslational modification that influences
protein activity, stability, and binding properties. The acetylation of histone
proteins in particular is a well-characterized feature of gene expression
regulation. In the protozoan parasiteToxoplasma gondii, a number of lysine
acetyltransferases (KATs) contribute to gene expression and are essential for
parasite viability. The natural product garcinol was recently reported to inhibit
enzymatic activities of GCN5 and p300 family KATs in other species. Here we show 
that garcinol inhibits TgGCN5b, the only nuclear GCN5 family KAT known to be
required forToxoplasmatachyzoite replication. Treatment of tachyzoites with
garcinol led to a reduction of global lysine acetylation, particularly on histone
H3 and TgGCN5b itself. We also performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq),
which revealed increasing aberrant gene expression coincident with increasing
concentrations of garcinol. The majority of the genes that were most
significantly affected by garcinol were also associated with TgGCN5b in a
previously reported chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with microarray
technology (ChIP-chip) analysis. The dysregulated gene expression induced by
garcinol significantly inhibitsToxoplasmatachyzoite replication, and the
concentrations used exhibit no overt toxicity on human host cells. Garcinol also 
inhibitsPlasmodium falciparumasexual replication with a 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) similar to that forToxoplasma Together, these data support
that pharmacological inhibition of TgGCN5b leads to a catastrophic failure in
gene expression control that prevents parasite replication.
