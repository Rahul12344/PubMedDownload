Plasmodium falciparum causes most human malaria deaths, having prehistorically
evolved from parasites of African Great Apes. Here we explore the genomic basis
of P. falciparum adaptation to human hosts by fully sequencing the genome of the 
closely related chimpanzee parasite species P. reichenowi, and obtaining partial 
sequence data from a more distantly related chimpanzee parasite (P. gaboni). The 
close relationship between P. reichenowi and P. falciparum is emphasized by
almost complete conservation of genomic synteny, but against this strikingly
conserved background we observe major differences at loci involved in erythrocyte
invasion. The organization of most virulence-associated multigene families,
including the hypervariable var genes, is broadly conserved, but P. falciparum
has a smaller subset of rif and stevor genes whose products are expressed on the 
infected erythrocyte surface. Genome-wide analysis identifies other loci under
recent positive selection, but a limited number of changes at the host-parasite
interface may have mediated host switching.
