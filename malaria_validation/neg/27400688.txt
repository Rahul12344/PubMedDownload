Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum gene kelch13 (pfkelch13) are strongly and
causally associated with resistance to anti-malarial drug artemisinin, but their 
effects on PfKelch13 structure and function remain unclear. Utilizing the
publicly available three-dimensional structure of PfKech13 (PDB ID: 4yy8), we
find that most of the mutations in its propeller domain occur in two spatial
clusters. Of these, one cluster is enriched in surface exposed residues which may
drive PfKelch13-centered protein interactions, and the second cluster mostly
contains residues which are buried and whose mutations may destabilize PfKelch13 
structure. The most prevalent resistant mutations C580Y and Y493H are distal from
the above two clusters. The C580Y mutation creates sterically unfavourable
contacts while Y493H possibly alters the hydrophobic core of the propeller
domain. These analyses will facilitate further experimental studies aimed at
understanding how mutations in pfkelch13 lead to artemisinin resistance.
