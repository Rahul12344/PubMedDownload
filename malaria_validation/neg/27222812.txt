The emergence and distribution of drug resistance in malaria are serious public
health concerns in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. However, the
molecular mechanism of drug resistance remains unclear. In the present study, we 
performed a high-throughput RNA-Seq to identify and characterize the
differentially expressed genes between the chloroquine (CQ) sensitive (3D7) and
resistant (Dd2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite cells were
cultured in the presence and absence of CQ by in vitro method. Total RNA was
isolated from the harvested parasite cells using TRIzol, and RNA-Seq was
conducted using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform with paired-end reads 
and annotated using Tophat. The transcriptome analysis of P. falciparum revealed 
the expression of ~ 5000 genes, in which ~ 60% of the genes have unknown
function. Cuffdiff program was used to identify the differentially expressed
genes between the CQ-sensitive and resistant strains. Here, we furnish a detailed
description of the experimental design, procedure, and analysis of the
transcriptome sequencing data, that have been deposited in the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (accession nos. PRJNA308455 and GSE77499).
