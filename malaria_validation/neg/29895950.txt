The plasmodial CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PfCCT) is a promising
antimalarial target, which can be inhibited to exploit the need for increased
lipid biosynthesis during the erythrocytic life stage of Plasmodium falciparum.
Notable structural and regulatory differences of plasmodial and mammalian CCTs
offer the possibility to develop species-specific inhibitors. The aim of this
study was to use CHO-MT58 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant CCT for
the functional characterization of PfCCT. We show that heterologous expression of
wild type PfCCT restores the viability of CHO-MT58 cells at non-permissive
(40 °C) temperatures, whereas catalytically perturbed or structurally
destabilized PfCCT variants fail to provide rescue. Detailed in vitro
characterization indicates that the H630N mutation diminishes the catalytic rate 
constant of PfCCT. The flow cytometry-based rescue assay provides a quantitative 
readout of the PfCCT function opening the possibility for the functional analysis
of PfCCT and the high throughput screening of antimalarial compounds targeting
plasmodial CCT.
