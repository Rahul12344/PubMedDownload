One in four proteins in Plasmodium falciparum contains asparagine repeats. We
probed the function of one such 28-residue asparagine repeat present in the P.
falciparum proteasome lid subunit 6, Rpn6. To aid our efforts, we developed a
regulatable, fluorescent affinity (RFA) tag that allows cellular localization,
manipulation of cellular levels, and affinity isolation of a chosen protein in P.
falciparum. The tag comprises a degradation domain derived from Escherichia coli 
dihydrofolate reductase together with GFP. The expression of RFA-tagged proteins 
is regulated by the simple folate analog trimethoprim (TMP). Parasite lines were 
generated in which full-length Rpn6 and an asparagine repeat-deletion mutant of
Rpn6 were fused to the RFA tag. The knockdown of Rpn6 upon removal of TMP
revealed that this protein is essential for ubiquitinated protein degradation and
for parasite survival, but the asparagine repeat is dispensable for protein
expression, stability, and function. The data point to a genomic mechanism for
repeat perpetuation rather than a positive cellular role. The RFA tag should
facilitate study of the role of essential genes in parasite biology.
