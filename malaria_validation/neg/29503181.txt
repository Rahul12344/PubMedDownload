Heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing is central to the adaptation and
survival of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, allowing clonally variant
gene expression during blood infection in humans. By assessing genome-wide
heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy, we present a comprehensive analysis of
heterochromatin landscapes across different Plasmodium species, strains, and life
cycle stages. Common targets of epigenetic silencing include fast-evolving
multi-gene families encoding surface antigens and a small set of conserved
HP1-associated genes with regulatory potential. Many P. falciparum
heterochromatic genes are marked in a strain-specific manner, increasing the
parasite's adaptive capacity. Whereas heterochromatin is strictly maintained
during mitotic proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, substantial
heterochromatin reorganization occurs in differentiating gametocytes and appears 
crucial for the activation of key gametocyte-specific genes and adaptation of
erythrocyte remodeling machinery. Collectively, these findings provide a catalog 
of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of
epigenetic control across the genus Plasmodium.
