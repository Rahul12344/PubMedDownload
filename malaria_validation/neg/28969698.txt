BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis (Diptera: Culicidae) is a primary vector of
Plasmodium vivax and Brugia malayi in most regions of China. In addition, its
phylogenetic relationship with the cryptic species of the Hyrcanus Group is
complex and remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genome sequences are widely used as
molecular markers for phylogenetic studies of mosquito species complexes, of
which mitochondrial genome data of An. sinensis is not available.
METHODS: An. sinensis samples was collected from Shandong, China, and identified 
by molecular marker. Genomic DNA was extracted, followed by the Illumina
sequencing. Two complete mitochondrial genomes were assembled and annotated using
the mitochondrial genome of An. gambiae as reference. The mitochondrial genomes
sequences of the 28 known Anopheles species were aligned and reconstructed
phylogenetic tree by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method.
FINDINGS: The length of complete mitochondrial genomes of An. sinensis was
15,076 bp and 15,138 bp, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA
(tRNA) genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and an AT-rich control region. As in 
other insects, most mitochondrial genes are encoded on the J strand, except for
ND5, ND4, ND4L, ND1, two rRNA and eight tRNA genes, which are encoded on the N
strand. The bootstrap value was set as 1000 in ML analyses. The topologies
restored phylogenetic affinity within subfamily Anophelinae. The ML tree showed
four major clades, corresponding to the subgenera Cellia, Anopheles,
Nyssorhynchus and Kerteszia of the genus Anopheles.
CONCLUSIONS: The complete mitochondrial genomes of An. sinensis were obtained.
The number, order and transcription direction of An. sinensis mitochondrial genes
were the same as in other species of family Culicidae.
