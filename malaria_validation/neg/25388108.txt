The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) is a useful
measure of the strength and mode of natural selection acting on protein-coding
genes. It is widely used to study patterns of selection on protein genes on a
genomic scale-from the small genomes of viruses, bacteria, and parasitic
eukaryotes to the largest eukaryotic genomes. In this chapter we describe all the
steps necessary to calculate the dN/dS of all the genes using at least two
genomes. We include a brief discussion on assigning orthologs, and of codon-aware
alignment of orthologs. We then describe how to use the CODEML program of the
PAML package for phylogenetic analysis to calculate the dN/dS and how to perform 
some statistical tests for positive selection. We then outline some methods for
interpreting output and describe how one may use this data to make discoveries
about the biology of your species. Finally, as a worked example we show all the
steps we used to calculate dN/dS for 3,261 orthologs from six Plasmodium species,
including tests for adaptive evolution (see worked_example.pdf).
