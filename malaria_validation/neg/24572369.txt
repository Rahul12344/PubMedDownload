The life cycles of many parasites involve transitions between disparate host
species, requiring these parasites to go through multiple developmental stages
adapted to each of these specialized niches. Transmission of malaria parasites
(Plasmodium spp.) from humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation
from asexual stages replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and
female gametocytes. Although gametocytes were first described in 1880, our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in commitment to gametocyte
formation is extremely limited, and disrupting this critical developmental
transition remains a long-standing goal. Here we show that expression levels of
the DNA-binding protein PfAP2-G correlate strongly with levels of gametocyte
formation. Using independent forward and reverse genetics approaches, we
demonstrate that PfAP2-G function is essential for parasite sexual
differentiation. By combining genome-wide PfAP2-G cognate motif occurrence with
global transcriptional changes resulting from PfAP2-G ablation, we identify early
gametocyte genes as probable targets of PfAP2-G and show that their regulation by
PfAP2-G is critical for their wild-type level expression. In the asexual
blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears to be among a set of epigenetically
silenced loci prone to spontaneous activation. Stochastic activation presents a
simple mechanism for a low baseline of gametocyte production. Overall, these
findings identify PfAP2-G as a master regulator of sexual-stage development in
malaria parasites and mark the first discovery of a transcriptional switch
controlling a differentiation decision in protozoan parasites.
