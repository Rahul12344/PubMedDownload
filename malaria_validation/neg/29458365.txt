BACKGROUND: Malaria is still one of the serious public health problems in Grande 
Comore Island, although the number of annual cases has been greatly reduced in
recent years. A better understanding of malaria parasite population diversity and
transmission dynamics is critical for assessing the effectiveness of malaria
control measures. The objective of this study is to investigate temporal changes 
in genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations and multiplicity of
infection (MOI) in Grande Comore 10 years after introduction of ACT.
METHODS: A total of 232 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected from the
Grande Comore Island during two sampling periods (118 for 2006‒2007 group, and
114 for 2013‒2016 group). Parasite isolates were characterized for genetic
diversity and complexity of infection by genotyping polymorphic regions in
merozoite surface protein gene 1 (msp-1), msp-2, and msp-3 using nested PCR and
DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Three msp-1 alleles (K1, MAD20, and RO33), two msp-2 alleles (FC27 and
3D7), and two msp-3 alleles (K1 and 3D7) were detected in parasites of both
sampling periods. The RO33 allele of msp-1 (84.8%), 3D7 allele of msp-2 (90.8%), 
and K1 allele of msp-3 (66.7%) were the predominant allelic types in isolates
from 2006-2007 group. In contrast, the RO33 allele of msp-1 (63.4%), FC27 allele 
of msp-2 (91.1%), and 3D7 allele of msp-3 (53.5%) were the most prevalent among
isolates from the 2013-2016 group. Compared with the 2006‒2007 group, polyclonal 
infection rates of msp-1 (from 76.7 to 29.1%, P < 0.01) and msp-2 (from 62.4 to
28.3%, P < 0.01) allelic types were significantly decreased in those from
2013‒2016 group. Similarly, the MOIs for both msp-1 and msp-2 were higher in P.
falciparum isolates in the 2006-2007 group than those in 2013-2016 group
(MOI = 3.11 vs 1.63 for msp-1; MOI = 2.75 vs 1.35 for msp-2). DNA sequencing
analyses also revealed reduced numbers of distinct sequence variants in the three
genes from 2006‒2007 to 2013‒2016: msp-1, from 32 to 23 (about 28% decline);
msp-2 from 29 to 21 (about 28% decline), and msp-3 from 11 to 3 (about 72%
decline).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data showed dramatic reduction in genetic diversity and 
MOI among Grande Comore P. falciparum populations over the course of the study,
suggesting a trend of decreasing malaria transmission intensity and genetic
diversity in Grande Comore Island. These data provide valuable information for
surveillance of P. falciparum infection and for assessing the appropriateness of 
the current malarial control strategies in the endemic area.
