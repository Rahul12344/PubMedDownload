Understanding how malaria parasites gain entry into human red blood cells is
essential for developing strategies to stop blood stage infection. Plasmodium
vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells.
The organism has two erythrocyte-binding protein families: namely, the
Duffy-binding protein (PvDBP) and the reticulocyte-binding protein (PvRBP)
families. Several members of the PvRBP family bind reticulocytes, specifically
suggesting a role in mediating host cell selectivity of P. vivax. Here, we
present, to our knowledge, the first high-resolution crystal structure of an
erythrocyte-binding domain from PvRBP2a, solved at 2.12 Å resolution. The
monomeric molecule consists of 10 α-helices and one short β-hairpin, and,
although the structural fold is similar to that of PfRh5--the essential invasion 
ligand in Plasmodium falciparum--its surface properties are distinct and provide 
a possible mechanism for recognition of alternate receptors. Sequence alignments 
of the crystallized fragment of PvRBP2a with other PvRBPs highlight the conserved
placement of disulfide bonds. PvRBP2a binds mature red blood cells through
recognition of an erythrocyte receptor that is neuraminidase- and
chymotrypsin-resistant but trypsin-sensitive. By examining the patterns of
sequence diversity within field isolates, we have identified and mapped
polymorphic residues to the PvRBP2a structure. Using mutagenesis, we have also
defined the critical residues required for erythrocyte binding. Characterization 
of the structural features that govern functional erythrocyte binding for the
PvRBP family provides a framework for generating new tools that block P. vivax
blood stage infection.
