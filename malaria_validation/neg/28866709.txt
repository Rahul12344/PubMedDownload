BACKGROUND Artemether, originally used for malaria, exhibits potential
therapeutic efficacy against several types of cancer, including gastric cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and gliomas. In this study, we investigated the role
and mechanism of artemether on drug resistance of neuroblastoma cells. MATERIAL
AND METHODS Cell viability and proliferation were determined by CCK-8 and EdU
incorporation assay, respectively. Gene expression was measured by real-time PCR 
and Western blot analysis. RESULTS Our results revealed that artemether treatment
remarkably inhibited the proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y,
SK-N-SH, and SK-N-BE2. In addition, co-treatment of tumor cells with artemether
and doxorubicin significantly reduced cell viability and DNA synthesis compared
with doxorubicin-treated cells. On the molecular level, we found that combined
treatment with artemether and doxorubicin suppressed the expression of B7-H3 both
at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, artemether failed to sensitize tumor
cells to doxorubicin in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing B7-H3. CONCLUSIONS
Artemether-mediated inhibition of B7-H3 may contribute to doxorubicin sensitivity
in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that artemether could serve as a potential
therapeutic option for neuroblastoma.
