Radicicol, an antifungal antibiotic, was previously identified as a compound
having antimalarial activity. However, its mechanism of action in Plasmodium
falciparum was not elucidated. While characterizing its antimalarial function, we
observed that radicicol manifested two distinct developmental defects in cultured
P. falciparum in a concentration-dependent manner. At a low concentration of
radicicol, a significant percentage of drug-treated parasites were arrested at
the schizont stage, while at a higher concentration, the parasites were unable to
multiply from schizont to ring. Also, the newly formed rings and trophozoites
were extremely delayed in development, eventually leading to cell death. We
intended to characterize the potential molecular target of radicicol at its
sublethal doses. Our results demonstrated that radicicol specifically impaired
mitochondrial replication. This decrement was associated with a severalfold
increment of the topoisomerase VIB transcript as well as protein in treated cells
over that of untreated parasites. Topoisomerase VIB was found to be localized in 
the organelle fraction. Our docking study revealed that radicicol fits into the
Bergerat fold of Pf topoisomerase VIB present in its ATPase domain. Altogether,
these data allow us to conclude that P. falciparum topoisomerase VIB might be one
of the targets of radicicol causing inhibition of mitochondrial replication.
Hence, radicicol can be suitably employed to explore the mitochondrial physiology
of malaria parasites.
