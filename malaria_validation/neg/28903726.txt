BACKGROUND: A simple and accurate molecular diagnostic method for malaria is
urgently needed due to the limitations of conventional microscopic examination.
In this study, we demonstrate a new diagnostic procedure for human malaria using 
loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and the MinION™ nanopore sequencer.
METHODS: We generated specific LAMP primers targeting the 18S-rRNA gene of all
five human Plasmodium species including two P. ovale subspecies (P. falciparum,
P. vivax, P. ovale wallikeri, P. ovale curtisi, P. knowlesi and P. malariae) and 
examined human blood samples collected from 63 malaria patients in Indonesia.
Additionally, we performed amplicon sequencing of our LAMP products using MinION™
nanopore sequencer to identify each Plasmodium species.
RESULTS: Our LAMP method allowed amplification of all targeted 18S-rRNA genes of 
the reference plasmids with detection limits of 10-100 copies per reaction. Among
the 63 clinical samples, 54 and 55 samples were positive by nested PCR and our
LAMP method, respectively. Identification of the Plasmodium species by LAMP
amplicon sequencing analysis using the MinION™ was consistent with the reference 
plasmid sequences and the results of nested PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our diagnostic method combined with LAMP and MinION™ could become a 
simple and accurate tool for the identification of human Plasmodium species, even
in resource-limited situations.
