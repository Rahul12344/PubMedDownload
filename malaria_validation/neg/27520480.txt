Malaria parasites possess a de novo heme synthetic pathway. Interestingly, this
pathway is dispensable during the blood stages of development in mammalian hosts.
The assembly of the two most important hemeproteins, cytochromes c and c1, is
mediated by cytochrome heme lyase enzymes. Plasmodium spp. possess two cytochrome
heme lyases encoded by separate genes. Given the redundancy of heme synthesis, we
sought to determine if heme lyase function also exhibits redundancy. To answer
this question, we performed gene knockout experiments. We found that the
PBANKA_143950 and PBANKA_0602600 Plasmodium berghei genes encoding cytochrome c
(Pbcchl) and cytochrome c1 (Pbcc1hl) heme lyases, respectively, can only be
disrupted when a complementary gene is present. In contrast, four genes in the de
novo heme synthesis pathway can be disrupted without complementation. This work
provides evidence that Pbcchl and Pbcc1hl are both essential and thus may be
antimalarial targets.
