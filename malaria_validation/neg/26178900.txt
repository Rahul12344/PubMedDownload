Trioxacarcin A is a polyoxygenated, structurally complex antibiotic produced by
Streptomyces spp., which possesses high anti-bacterial, anti-malaria, and
anti-tumor activities. The trioxacarcin biosynthetic pathway involves type II
polyketide synthases (PKSs) with L-isoleucine as a unique starter unit, as well
as many complex post-PKS tailoring enzymes and resistance and regulatory
proteins. In this work, two regulatory genes, txn9 coding for a Streptomyces
antibiotic regulatory protein family regulator and txn11 for a two-component
response regulator, were revealed to be absolutely required for trioxacarcin
production by individually inactivating all the six annotated regulatory genes in
the txn cluster. Complementation assay suggested that these two activators do not
have a regulatory cascade relationship. Moreover, transcriptional analysis showed
that they activate 15 of the 28 txn operons, indicating that a complicated
regulatory network is involved in the trioxacarcin production. Information gained
from this study may be useful for improving the production of the highly potent
trioxacarcin A.
