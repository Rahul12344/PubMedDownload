A platyhelminth, Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, belonging to the class Cestoda,
causes human sparganosis, and infection with its larva results in subtle
inflammation in the body of its host. We previously reported the purification of 
a glycoprotein, plerocercoid-immunosuppressive factor (P-ISF) from the
excretory/secretory products of S. erinaceieuropaei plerocercoids that may be
involved in immuno-modification. We determined the sequence of P-ISF from the
N-terminal and the internal 10 amino acids of P-ISF using degenerate PCR and 5'- 
and 3'-RACE methods. The putative gene encoding P-ISF was 1443 bp long and the
gene contained 10 exons and 9 introns in a genomic DNA of size 5205 bp. P-ISF
consists of 480 amino acids including the N-terminal signal peptide sequence, and
has two unknown domains,-cestoda cysteine-rich domains (CCDs) and a fibronectin
type III domain between the two CCDs. All cysteine residues were conserved in the
two CCDs, which shared 62% amino acid identities. Homologous analysis revealed
that the CCDs were homologous with an unknown protein of Diphyllobothrium latum. 
To produce specific antibodies, we expressed recombinant P-ISF (rP-ISF) using
wheat germ protein synthetic system. P-ISF was localized in the sub-cutaneous
tissues and the parenchymal tissues of plerocercoids. Transcription of P-ISF was 
detected only in plerocercoid stage, but not in adult stage. Western blotting
also showed a band in plerocercoide stage but not in adult. The rP-ISF did not
suppress nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, and this
might be due to lack of carbohydrate chains in the recombinant protein.
