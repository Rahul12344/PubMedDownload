BACKGROUND: The monkey parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is an emerging public health 
issue in Southeast Asia. In Sabah, Malaysia, P. knowlesi is now the dominant
cause of human malaria. Molecular detection methods for P. knowlesi are essential
for accurate diagnosis and in monitoring progress towards malaria elimination of 
other Plasmodium species. However, recent commercially available PCR malaria kits
have unpublished P. knowlesi gene targets or have not been evaluated against
clinical samples.
METHODS: Two real-time PCR methods currently used in Sabah for confirmatory
malaria diagnosis and surveillance reporting were evaluated: the QuantiFast™
Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) targeting the P. knowlesi 18S SSU rRNA; and
the abTES™ Malaria 5 qPCR II kit (AITbiotech, Singapore), with an undisclosed P. 
knowlesi gene target. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using 52 P. knowlesi, 25 
Plasmodium vivax, 21 Plasmodium falciparum, and 10 Plasmodium malariae clinical
isolates, and 26 malaria negative controls, and compared against a validated
reference nested PCR assay. The limit of detection (LOD) for each PCR method and 
Plasmodium species was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the QuantiFast™ and abTES™ assays for detecting P.
knowlesi was comparable at 98.1% (95% CI 89.7-100) and 100% (95% CI 93.2-100),
respectively. Specificity of the QuantiFast™ and abTES™ for P. knowlesi was high 
at 98.8% (95% CI 93.4-100) for both assays. The QuantiFast™ assay demonstrated
falsely-positive mixed Plasmodium species at low parasitaemias in both the
primary and LOD analysis. Diagnostic accuracy of both PCR kits for detecting P.
vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae was comparable to P. knowlesi. The abTES™
assay demonstrated a lower LOD for P. knowlesi of ≤ 0.125 parasites/µL compared
to QuantiFast™ with a LOD of 20 parasites/µL. Hospital microscopy demonstrated a 
sensitivity of 78.8% (95% CI 65.3-88.9) and specificity of 80.4% (95% CI
67.6-89.8) compared to reference PCR for detecting P. knowlesi.
CONCLUSION: The QuantiFast™ and abTES™ commercial PCR kits performed well for the
accurate detection of P. knowlesi infections. Although the QuantiFast™ kit is
cheaper, the abTES™ kit demonstrated a lower LOD, supporting its use as a
second-line referral-laboratory diagnostic tool in Sabah, Malaysia.
