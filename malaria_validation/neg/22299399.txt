Chloroquine (CQ) remains the first line drug for the prevention and treatment of 
malaria in Malaysia in spite of the fact that resistance to CQ has been observed 
in Malaysia since the 1960s. CQ-resistance is associated with various mutations
in pfcrt, which encodes a putative transporter located in the digestive vacuolar 
membrane of P. falciparum. Substitution of lysine (K) to threonine (T) at amino
acid 76 (K76T) in pfcrt is the primary genetic marker conferring resistance to
CQ. To determine the presence of T76 mutation in pfcrt from selected areas of
Kalabakan, Malaysia 619 blood samples were screened for P. falciparum, out of
which 31 were positive. Blood samples were collected on 3 MM Whatman filter
papers and DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA mini kit. RFLP-PCR for the detection
of the CQ-resistant T76 and sensitive K76 genotype was carried out. Twenty-five
samples were shown to have the point mutation in pfcrt whereas the remaining
samples were classified as CQ-sensitive (wild-type). In view of the fact that CQ 
is the first line anti-malarial drug in Malaysia, this finding could be an
important indication that treatment with CQ may no longer be effective in the
future.
