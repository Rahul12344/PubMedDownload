Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is the first line to treat uncomplicated
Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide. Artemisinin treatment failures are on
the rise in southeast Asia. Delayed parasite clearance after ACT is associated
with mutations of the P. falciparum kelch 13 gene. Patients (N = 148) in five
districts of northwest Ethiopia were enrolled in a 28-day ACT trial. We
identified a unique kelch 13 mutation (R622I) in 3/125 (2.4%) samples. The three 
isolates with R622I were from Negade-Bahir and Aykel districts close to the
Ethiopia-Sudan border. One of three patients with the mutant strain was
parasitemic at day 3; however, all patients cleared parasites by day 28.
Correlation between kelch 13 mutations and parasite clearance was not possible
due to the low frequency of mutations in this study.
