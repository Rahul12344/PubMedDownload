In this study, we performed cell-free expression of Plasmodium proteins using the
in vitro human cell-free protein expression systems for DNA and mRNA. Malaria
rhoptry genes (PFc14_0344, PFc0120w, PY01759, PY00763, PY07482, and PY04666) and 
a Maurer's cleft gene (PfA0680c) identified from proteome analysis studies were
cloned into the pT7CFE1-CHis expression vector. Following a coupled
transcription-translation procedure, expressed proteins were analyzed by His-tag 
staining and by western blotting using protein specific antibodies and
nickel-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for histidine detection. Antibodies against
whole rhoptries of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii merozoites and
antibodies specific for the PfMC-2TM protein identified translated proteins. The 
rhoptry specific antibodies exhibited cross reactivity among the expressed
proteins of P. falciparum and P. yoelii. The results demonstrate that the in
vitro human cell-free protein expression system is suitable for rapid expression 
and screening of malaria vaccine candidates and diagnostic biomarkers.
