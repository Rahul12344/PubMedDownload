Conditional cell death systems are useful for various aspects of basic science
with a wide range of applications, including genetic pest control. We recently
demonstrated that expression of the mammalian pro-apoptotic factor, B-cell
leukaemia/lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), can induce apoptosis in specific
tissues by using tissue specific promoters in silkworm and mosquito. Here, we
newly identified a functional promoter in the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles
stephensi, which enables gene expression specifically in the testis. We produced 
a transgenic mosquito line that expresses mouse Bax under the control of this
testis-specific promoter. Transgenic mosquito males exhibited aberrant testes
without functional sperm and complete sterility, whereas transgenic females
maintained normal fecundity. Despite their abnormal testes, the transgenic males 
maintained normal function of male accessory glands and typical mating behaviour.
As a result of mating with these males, females showed refractoriness to further 
mating. These results suggest that transgenic males induce female sterility via
mating. The mosquito is one of the most important disease vectors, and the
control of their population benefits global public health. Thus, this
Bax-mediated synthetic male-specific sterilization system could be applied to
population control of mosquitoes.
