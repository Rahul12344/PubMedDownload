The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, depends on a coordinated
regulation of gene expression for development and propagation within the human
host. Recent developments suggest that gene regulation in the parasite is largely
controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we discuss recent advancements
contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling gene regulation
in the parasite, including nucleosome landscape, histone modifications, and
nuclear architecture. In addition, various processes involved in regulation of
parasite-specific genes and gene families are examined. Finally, we address the
use of epigenetic processes as targets for novel antimalarial therapies.
Collectively, these topics highlight the unique biology of P. falciparum, and
contribute to our understanding of mechanisms regulating gene expression in this 
deadly parasite.
