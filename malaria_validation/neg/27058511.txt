Plasmodium falciparum surface protein 25 (Pfs25) is a hard-to-express and
hard-to-solubilize protein in Escherichia coli. To overcome this problem, the
phase 1 flagellin of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (FliC) was used as a
fusion partner for Pfs25. The fusion expression of Pfs25 with FliC greatly
enhanced the expression level and solubility of Pfs25 in E. coli BL21(DE3). The
Ni-purified fusion protein of FliC-Pfs25 was recognized by two anti-Pfs25
monoclonal antibodies. By comparison, it was shown that the Pfs25 within
FliC-Pfs25 contained epitopes similar or identical to those on Pichia
pastoris-produced Pfs25. The data obtained from this study demonstrated that the 
fusion with Salmonella flagellin greatly improved the expression of Pfs25 in E.
coli.
