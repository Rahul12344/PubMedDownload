BACKGROUND: Non-human primates have long been identified to harbour different
species of Plasmodium. Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), in particular,
are reservoirs for P. knowlesi, P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi and P. fieldi.
A previous study conducted in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, however revealed that
long-tailed macaques could potentially harbour novel species of Plasmodium based 
on sequences of small subunit ribosomal RNA and circumsporozoite genes. To
further validate this finding, the mitochondrial genome and the apicoplast
caseinolytic protease M genes of Plasmodium spp. were sequenced from 43
long-tailed macaque blood samples.
RESULTS: Apart from several named species of malaria parasites, long-tailed
macaques were found to be potentially infected with novel species of Plasmodium, 
namely one we refer to as "P. inui-like." This group of parasites bifurcated into
two monophyletic clades indicating the presence of two distinct sub-populations. 
Further analyses, which relied on the assumption of strict co-phylogeny between
hosts and parasites, estimated a population expansion event of between 150,000 to
250,000Â years before present of one of these sub-populations that preceded that
of the expansion of P. knowlesi. Furthermore, both sub-populations were found to 
have diverged from a common ancestor of P. inui approximately 1.5 million years
ago. In addition, the phylogenetic analyses also demonstrated that long-tailed
macaques are new hosts for P. simiovale.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria infections of long-tailed macaques of Sarawak, Malaysian
Borneo are complex and include a novel species of Plasmodium that is
phylogenetically distinct from P. inui. These macaques are new natural hosts of
P. simiovale, a species previously described only in toque monkeys (Macaca
sinica) in Sri Lanka. The results suggest that ecological factors could affect
the evolution of malaria parasites.
