Mutually exclusive expression of the var multigene family is key to immune
evasion and pathogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum, but few factors have been
shown to play a direct role. We adapted a CRISPR-based proteomics approach to
identify novel factors associated with var genes in their natural chromatin
context. Catalytically inactive Cas9 ("dCas9") was targeted to var gene
regulatory elements, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed with mass spectrometry.
Known and novel factors were enriched including structural proteins, DNA
helicases, and chromatin remodelers. Functional characterization of PfISWI, an
evolutionarily divergent putative chromatin remodeler enriched at the var gene
promoter, revealed a role in transcriptional activation. Proteomics of PfISWI
identified several proteins enriched at the var gene promoter such as acetyl-CoA 
synthetase, a putative MORC protein, and an ApiAP2 transcription factor. These
findings validate the CRISPR/dCas9 proteomics method and define a new var
gene-associated chromatin complex. This study establishes a tool for targeted
chromatin purification of unaltered genomic loci and identifies novel
chromatin-associated factors potentially involved in transcriptional control
and/or chromatin organization of virulence genes in the human malaria parasite.
