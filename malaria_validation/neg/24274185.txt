BACKGROUND: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a new ACT that is administered as
single daily dose for three days and has been demonstrated to be tolerated and
highly effective for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
malaria. Piperaquine was used alone to replace chloroquine as the first-line
treatment for uncomplicated malaria in China in response to increasing
chloroquine resistance in the 1970s. However, the rapid emergence of
piperaquine-resistant strains that resulted in the cessation of its use in China 
in the 1980s, suggests that there is cross-resistance between piperaquine and
chloroquine. Very few data are available on cross-resistance between piperaquine 
and chloroquine, and the data that do exist are often contradictory.
METHODS: In total, 280 P. falciparum isolates, collected between April 2008 and
June 2012 from patients hospitalized in France with imported malaria from a
malaria-endemic country, were assessed ex vivo for piperaquine and chloroquine
susceptibilities by using the standard 42-hour 3H-hypoxanthine uptake inhibition 
method. The chloroquine resistance-associated mutation K76T in pfcrt was also
investigated for the 280 isolates.
RESULTS: The IC50 for piperaquine ranged from 9.8 nM to 217.3 nM (mean = 81.3 nM.
The IC50 for chloroquine ranged from 5.0 nM to 1,918 nM (mean = 83.6 nM. A
significant but low correlation was observed between the Log IC50 values for
piperaquine and chloroquine (r = 0.145, p < 0.001). However, the coefficient of
determination of 0.021 indicates that only 2.1% of the variation in the response 
to piperaquine is explained by the variation in the response to chloroquine. The 
mean value for piperaquine was 74.0 nM in the Pfcrt K76 wild-type group
(no = 125) and 87.7 nM in the 76 T mutant group (no = 155). This difference was
not significant (p = 0.875, Mann Whitney U test).
CONCLUSIONS: The present work demonstrates that there was no cross-resistance
between piperaquine and chloroquine among 280 P. falciparum isolates and that
piperaquine susceptibility is not associated with pfcrt, the gene involved in
chloroquine resistance. These results confirm the efficacy of piperaquine in
association with dihydroartemisinin and support its use in areas in which
parasites are resistant to chloroquine.
