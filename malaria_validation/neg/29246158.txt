BACKGROUND: Humans living in regions with high falciparum malaria transmission
intensity harbour multi-strain infections comprised of several genetically
distinct malaria haplotypes. The number of distinct malaria parasite haplotypes
identified from an infected human host at a given time is referred to as the
complexity of infection (COI). In this study, an amplicon-based deep sequencing
method targeting the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was
utilized to (1) investigate the relationship between P. falciparum prevalence and
COI, (2) to explore the population genetic structure of P. falciparum parasites
from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating in the 2007 Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and (3) to explore
selection pressures on geospatially divergent parasite populations by comparing
AMA1 amino acid frequencies in the DRC and Mali.
RESULTS: A total of 900 P. falciparum infections across 11 DRC provinces were
examined. Deep sequencing of both individuals, for COI analysis, and pools of
individuals, to examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1
haplotypes. The majority of individual infections (64.5%) contained polyclonal
(COI > 1) malaria infections based on the presence of genetically distinct pfama1
haplotypes. A minimal correlation between COI and malaria prevalence as
determined by sensitive real-time PCR was identified. Population genetic analyses
revealed extensive haplotype diversity, the vast majority of which was shared
across the sites. AMA1 amino acid frequencies were similar between parasite
populations in the DRC and Mali.
CONCLUSIONS: Amplicon-based deep sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of
multi-strain infections that can aid in the understanding of antigen
heterogeneity of potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of
malaria parasites, and factors that influence complex, polyclonal malaria
infections. While AMA1 and other diverse markers under balancing selection may
perform well for understanding COI, they may offer little geographic or temporal 
discrimination between parasite populations.
