Malaria is a real and constant danger to nearly half of the world's population of
7.4 billion people. In 2015, 212 million cases were reported along with 429,000
estimated deaths. The World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based
combinatorial therapies, and the artemisinin for this purpose is mainly isolated 
from the plant Artemisia annua. However, the plant supply of artemisinin is
irregular, leading to fluctuation in prices. Here, we report the development of a
simple, sustainable, and scalable production platform of artemisinin. The five
genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis were engineered into the moss
Physcomitrella patens via direct in vivo assembly of multiple DNA fragments. In
vivo biosynthesis of artemisinin was obtained without further modifications. A
high initial production of 0.21 mg/g dry weight artemisinin was observed after
only 3 days of cultivation. Our study shows that P. patens can be a sustainable
and efficient production platform of artemisinin that without further
modifications allow for industrial-scale production. A stable supply of
artemisinin will lower the price of artemisinin-based treatments, hence become
more affordable to the lower income communities most affected by malaria; an
important step toward containment of this deadly disease threatening millions
every year.
