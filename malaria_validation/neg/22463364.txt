BACKGROUND: In order to prepare the field site for future interventions, the
prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection was evaluated in a
cohort of children living in Brazzaville. Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
protein 2 gene (msp2) was used to characterize the genetic diversity and the
multiplicity of infection. The prevalence of mutant P. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter (pfcrt) allele in isolates was also determined.
METHODS: Between April and June 2010, 313 children below 10 years of age enrolled
in the cohort for malaria surveillance were screened for P. falciparum infection 
using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The children were selected 
on the basis of being asymptomatic. Plasmodium falciparum msp2 gene was genotyped
by allele-specific nested PCR and the pfcrt K76T mutation was detected using
nested PCR followed by restriction endonuclease digestion.
RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections was 8.6% and 16%
by microscopy and by PCR respectively. Allele typing of the msp2 gene detected
55% and 45% of 3D7 and FC27 allelic families respectively. The overall
multiplicity of infections (MOI) was 1.3. A positive correlation between parasite
density and multiplicity of infection was found. The prevalence of the mutant
pfcrt allele (T76) in the isolates was 92%.
CONCLUSION: This is the first molecular characterization of P. falciparum field
isolates in Congolese children, four years after changing the malaria treatment
policy from chloroquine (CQ) to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The 
low prevalence of asymptomatic infections and MOI is discussed in the light of
similar studies conducted in Central Africa.
