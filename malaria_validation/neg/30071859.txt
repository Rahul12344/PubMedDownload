BACKGROUND: 8-Aminoquinolines such as primaquine clear mature Plasmodium
falciparum gametocytes that are responsible for transmission from human to
mosquitoes and bring radical cure in Plasmodium vivax by clearing dormant liver
stages. Deployment of primaquine is thus of relevance for malaria elimination
efforts but challenged by the widespread prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) in endemic countries since primaquine in G6PDd
individuals may lead to acute haemolysis. In this study, the prevalence of G6PDd 
was investigated in different settings in Ethiopia using phenotyping and
genotyping approaches.
METHODS: Community and school based cross-sectional surveys were conducted from
October to December 2016 in four administrative regions (Gambela, Benishangul
Gumuz, Oromia, and Amhara) in Ethiopia. Finger prick blood samples were collected
for G6PD enzyme activity using the CareStartâ„¢ G6PD screening test and genotyping 
of 36 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the G6PD gene
and its flanking regions.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of phenotypic G6PDd was 1.4% (22/1609). For the 
first time in the Ethiopian population, the African variant (A-) was detected in 
3.5% (7/199) of the limited set of genotyped samples, which were all
phenotypically normal. Interestingly, all of these individuals had a variation at
the rs2515904 locus. Strong geographical variation was observed for both
phenotypic and genotypic G6PDd; three-quarters of the phenotypically G6PDd
individuals were detected in Gambela.
CONCLUSION: A very low prevalence of G6PDd was detected in the present study
populations. The presence of the A- variant alongside other G6PD mutants and the 
patchy distribution of G6PDd indicate that larger studies specifically designed
to unravel the distribution of G6PDd at small geographical scale may be needed to
tailor malaria elimination efforts in Ethiopia to the local context.
