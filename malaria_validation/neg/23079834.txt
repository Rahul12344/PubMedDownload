The need for a more sensitive and time-efficient assay for malaria has led to the
development of molecular assays involving real-time PCR (qPCR), a procedure that 
has the potential to detect low levels of parasitemia, identify mixed infections,
and allow for precise differentiation of species via melting curve analysis or
TaqMan fluorescence-labeled probes. Since the first study published in 2001 at
least 17 assays have been developed, most of them using SSUrRNA as the target
gene. We used qPCR to detect Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax by amplification 
of mtDNA; this technique was evaluated on whole-blood samples from people living 
in areas of malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon region located in the
area of inclusion of highway BR-163 (Cuiabá-Santarém) in Pará State: São Luiz do 
Tapajós, a municipal district of Itaituba (N = 74); Três Boeiras, a municipal
district of Trairão (N = 134), and São Raimundo, a municipal district of Aveiro
(N = 62). The results from the real-time PCR-based method were compared to
conventional microscopy and to an established mtDNA-PCR assay. The qPCR (mtDNA)
method was 16-19 times more efficient than the conventional PCR (mtDNA) and
microscopy for detecting plasmodial infections.
