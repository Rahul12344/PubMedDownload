Immunization of humans with whole sporozoites confers complete, sterilizing
immunity against malaria infection. However, achieving consistent safety while
maintaining immunogenicity of whole parasite vaccines remains a formidable
challenge. We generated a genetically attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
malaria parasite by deleting three genes expressed in the pre-erythrocytic stage 
(Pf p52-/p36-/sap1-). We then tested the safety and immunogenicity of the
genetically engineered (Pf GAP3KO) sporozoites in human volunteers. Pf GAP3KO
sporozoites were delivered to 10 volunteers using infected mosquito bites with a 
single exposure consisting of 150 to 200 bites per subject. All subjects remained
blood stage-negative and developed inhibitory antibodies to sporozoites. GAP3KO
rodent malaria parasites engendered complete, protracted immunity against
infectious sporozoite challenge in mice. The results warrant further clinical
testing of Pf GAP3KO and its potential development into a vaccine strain.
