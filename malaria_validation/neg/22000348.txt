Naturally acquired human infections with Plasmodium knowlesi are endemic to
Southeast Asia. To determine the prevalence of P. knowlesi malaria in
malaria-endemic areas of Thailand, we analyzed genetic characteristics of P.
knowlesi circulating among naturally infected macaques and humans. This study in 
2008-2009 and retrospective analysis of malaria species in human blood samples
obtained in 1996 from 1 of these areas showed that P. knowlesi accounted for
0.67% and 0.48% of human malaria cases, respectively, indicating that this simian
parasite is not a newly emergent human pathogen in Thailand. Sequence analysis of
the complete merozoite surface protein 1 gene of P. knowlesi from 10 human and 5 
macaque blood samples showed considerable genetic diversity among isolates. The
sequence from 1 patient was identical with that from a pig-tailed macaque living 
in the same locality, suggesting cross-transmission of P. knowlesi from naturally
infected macaques to humans.
