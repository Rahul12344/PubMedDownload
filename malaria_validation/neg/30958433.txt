BACKGROUND: In the era of precision medicine, chemotherapy is still considered
the cornerstone of treatment for lung cancer patients without gene mutations. How
to reduce the toxicity and increase the efficiency of chemotherapy is worth
exploring. This study aimed to investigate the curative effects and safety of
hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy (HCT) for advanced patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with malignant pleural
effusion.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated medical records of 93 patients with
advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB-IV) from March 2011 to January 2014. The patients were
divided into HCT and chemotherapy (CT) groups. The HCT group was treated with
gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) regimen combined with regional radiofrequency deep
hyperthermia, while the CT group was treated with GP regimen only. Those with
malignant pleural effusion extra underwent thoracentesis and intrapleural
injection chemotherapy combined with hyperthermic or not. Clinical treatment
results and adverse reactions were compared and analyzed after treatment. SPSS
19.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA) was used for statistical data processing. P values
less than 0.05 were accepted to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: Among the 93 patients, HCT group included 48 patients (16 patients with 
malignant pleural effusion), CT group included 45 patients (10 patients with
malignant pleural effusion). There was no significant difference between the two 
groups in patient characteristics. The overall response rate (ORR) of pleural
effusions was much better in HCT group than that in CT group (81.2% vs. 40.0%,
P = 0.046). The patients in HCT group had lower incidence rate of weakness (12.5%
vs. 46.7%, χ = 13.16, P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal (25.0% vs. 77.8%,
χ = 25.88, P < 0.001) adverse reactions than that in CT group. The objective
tumor response and survival showed no significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy might lead to the
development of better therapeutic strategy for advanced NSCLC with malignant
pleural effusion patients. Also, it could greatly reduce the chemotherapy toxic
effects in the incidence of weakness and gastrointestinal adverse reactions in
advanced NSCLC patients.
