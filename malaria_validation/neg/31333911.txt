Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the major subtype of lung cancer and
the most lethal malignant disease worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying LUAD are not fully understood.
Methods: Four datasets (GSE118370, GSE85841, GSE43458 and GSE32863) were obtained
from the gene expression omnibus (GEO). Identification of differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment analysis were performed using
the limma and clusterProfiler packages, respectively. A protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network was constructed via Search Tool for the Retrieval of
Interacting Genes (STRING) database, and the module analysis was performed by
Cytoscape. Then, overall survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier
curve, and prognostic candidate biomarkers were further analyzed using the
Oncomine database.
Results: Totally, 349 DEGs were identified, including 275 downregulated and 74
upregulated genes which were significantly enriched in the biological process of 
extracellular structure organization, leukocyte migration and response to
peptide. The mainly enriched pathways were complement and coagulation cascades,
malaria and prion diseases. By extracting key modules from the PPI network, 11
hub genes were screened out. Survival analysis showed that except VSIG4, other
hub genes may be involved in the development of LUAD, in which MYH10, METTL7A,
FCER1G and TMOD1 have not been reported previously to correlated with LUAD.
Briefly, novel hub genes identified in this study will help to deepen our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LUAD carcinogenesis and progression,
and to discover candidate targets for early detection and treatment of LUAD.
