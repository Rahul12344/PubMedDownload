The Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (Pvmsp-1) locus codes for a
major asexual blood-stage antigen currently proposed as a malaria vaccine
candidate antigen. However, extensive polymorphism of this protein has been
observed in isolates from different geographical areas. Here, we investigate the 
extent and the frequency of allelic diversity at the Pvmsp-1 locus in field
isolates collected in the Republic of Korea during the past decade. Among the 45 
Korean isolates, six Pvmsp-1 gene types (SKOR-I to SKOR-VI) were identified as
unique combinations of type sequences in each variable block. Of these six
different Pvmsp-1 gene types, two major Pvmsp-1 allelic types were found in 72%
(SKOR-I) and 28% (SKOR-II) of field isolates collected in 1996 to 2000, and four 
different allelic types (SKOR-III to SKOR-VI) emerged in 70% (10-25%) of isolates
collected in 2007 to 2009. These results suggest that allelic diversity of
Pvmsp-1 increased in several variable regions, including the N- and C-terminals, 
after reemergence of P. vivax parasites in the Republic of Korea.
