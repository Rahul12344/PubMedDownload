Tick saliva contains a number of effector molecules that inhibit host immunity
and facilitate pathogen transmission. How tick proteins regulate immune
signaling, however, is incompletely understood. Here, we describe that loop 2 of 
sialostatin L2, an anti-inflammatory tick protein, binds to annexin A2 and
impairs the formation of the NLRC4 inflammasome during infection with the
rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum Macrophages deficient in annexin A2
secreted significantly smaller amounts of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and
had a defect in NLRC4 inflammasome oligomerization and caspase-1 activation.
Accordingly, Annexin a2-deficient mice were more susceptible to A.
phagocytophilum infection and showed splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and
monocytopenia. Providing translational support to our findings, better binding of
annexin A2 to sialostatin L2 in sera from 21 out of 23 infected patients than in 
sera from control individuals was also demonstrated. Overall, we establish a
unique mode of inflammasome evasion by a pathogen, centered on a blood-feeding
arthropod.
