For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the
network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of
individuals in a social network. Here we demonstrate how this 'metadata' can be
used to improve our understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on
the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically
principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect
communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the
method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we
are trying to find. Instead, the method learns whether a correlation exists and
correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful
information. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure
and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological and
technological domains.
