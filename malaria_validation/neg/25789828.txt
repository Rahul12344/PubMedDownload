Towards genome-wide experimental genetics in the in vivo malaria model parasite
Plasmodium berghei.

Matz JM, Kooij TW.

Plasmodium berghei was identified as a parasite of thicket rats (Grammomys
dolichurus) and Anopheles dureni mosquitoes in African highland forests.
Successful adaptation to a range of rodent and mosquito species established P.
berghei as a malaria model parasite. The introduction of stable transfection
technology, permitted classical reverse genetics strategies and thus systematic
functional profiling of the gene repertoire. In the past 10 years following the
publication of the P. berghei genome sequence, many new tools for experimental
genetics approaches have been developed and existing ones have been improved. The
infection of mice is the principal limitation towards a genome-wide repository of
mutant parasite lines. In the past few years, there have been some promising and 
most welcome developments that allow rapid selection and isolation of recombinant
parasites while simultaneously minimising animal usage. Here, we provide an
overview of all the currently available tools and methods.
