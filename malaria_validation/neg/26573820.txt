BACKGROUND: Genome editing of malaria parasites is key to the generation of live 
attenuated parasites used in experimental vaccination approaches. DNA repair in
Plasmodium generally occurs only through homologous recombination. This has been 
used to generate transgenic parasites that lack one to three genes, leading to
developmental arrest in the liver and allowing the host to launch a protective
immune response. While effective in principle, this approach is not safe for use 
in humans as single surviving parasites can still cause disease. Here we use
zinc-finger nucleases to generate attenuated parasite lines lacking an entire
chromosome arm, by a timed induction of a double-strand break. Rare surviving
parasites also allow the investigation of unconventional DNA repair mechanisms in
a rodent malaria parasite.
RESULTS: A single, zinc-finger nuclease-induced DNA double-strand break results
in the generation of attenuated parasite lines that show varying degrees of
developmental arrest, protection efficacy in an immunisation regime and safety,
depending on the timing of zinc-finger nuclease expression within the life cycle.
We also identify DNA repair by microhomology-mediated end joining with as little 
as four base pairs, resulting in surviving parasites and thus breakthrough
infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria parasites can repair DNA double-strand breaks with
surprisingly small mini-homology domains located across the break point. Timely
expression of zinc-finger nucleases could be used to generate a new generation of
attenuated parasite lines lacking hundreds of genes.
