BACKGROUND: Malaria is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Pakistan is
considered as a moderate malaria-endemic country but still, 177 million
individuals are at risk of malaria. Roughly 60% of Pakistan's population, live in
malaria-endemic regions. The present study is based upon the survey of various
health care centers in 10 major cities of Northern and Southern Punjab to find
out the malarial infection patterns in 2015. The diagnosis, seasonal variations, 
age and gender-wise distribution of Plasmodium spp. circulating in the study area
were also included in the objectives.
METHODS: The malaria-suspected patients '16075' were enrolled for malaria
diagnosis using microscopy, out of which 925 were malaria positive which were
processed for molecular analysis using nested PCR. The 18S rRNA genes of
Plasmodium species were amplified, sequenced, blast and the phylogenetic tree was
constructed based on sequences using online integrated tool MEGA7.
RESULTS: The 364 cases recruited from Northern Punjab with the highest incidence 
in Rawalpindi (25.5%) and lowest in Chakwal (15.9%). From Southern Punjab 561
cases were enlisted Rajanpur (21.4%) maximum and lowest from Multan and Rahim Yar
Khan (18%). The slide positivity rate, annual parasite incidence, and annual
blood examination rates were 5.7 per 1000 population, 0.1, and 0.2% respectively.
The only P. vivax (66.7%), P. falciparum (23.7%) and mixed infection by these two
species (9.6%) were diagnosed. The same trend (P. vivax > P. falciparum > mixed
infection) in species identification %age was confirmed from molecular analysis. 
However, the occurrence of malaria was higher in Southern Punjab (5.5%) as
compared to the Northern Punjab (4.0%). The overall malaria percentage occurrence
of treatment-seeking patients in all recruited cities of Punjab was 4.9%. The
age-group of 1-20 and males among genders were more affected by malaria. The
comparison of different seasons showed that the malaria infection was at a peak
in Summer and post-monsoon.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of malaria was high in the flood infected rural areas
of Southern Punjab, Summer, and post-monsoon. The age group (1-20) and
gender-wise males were more affected by malaria.
