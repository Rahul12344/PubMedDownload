A shared feature of the motile stages (zoites) of malaria parasites is a cortical
cytoskeletal structure termed subpellicular network (SPN), thought to define and 
maintain cell shape. Plasmodium alveolins comprise structural components of the
SPN, and alveolin gene knockout causes morphological abnormalities that coincide 
with markedly reduced tensile strength of the affected zoites, indicating the
alveolins are prime cell shape determinants. Here, we characterize a novel SPN
protein of Plasmodium berghei ookinetes and sporozoites named G2 (glycine at
position 2), which is structurally unrelated to alveolins. G2 knockout abolishes 
parasite transmission and causes zoite malformations and motility defects similar
to those observed in alveolin null mutants. Unlike alveolins, however, G2
contributes little to tensile strength, arguing against a cause-effect
relationship between tensile strength and cell shape. We also show that G2 null
mutant sporozoites display an abnormal arrangement of their subpellicular
microtubules. These results provide important new understanding of the factors
that determine zoite morphogenesis, as well as the potential roles of the
cortical cytoskeleton in gliding motility.
