BACKGROUND: Congenital malaria is defined as malaria parasitaemia in the first
week of life. The reported prevalence of congenital malaria in sub-Saharan Africa
is variable (0 - 46%). Even though the clinical significance of congenital
malaria parasitaemia is uncertain, anti-malarial drugs are empirically prescribed
for sick newborns by frontline health care workers. Data on prevalence of
congenital malaria in high-risk newborns will inform appropriate drug use and
timely referral of sick newborns.
METHODS: Blood samples of untreated newborns less than 1 week of age at the time 
of referral to Korle Bu Teaching hospital in Accra, Ghana during the peak malaria
seasons (April to July) of 2008 and 2010 were examined for malaria parasites by, 
i) Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears for parasite count and species
identification, ii) histidine-rich protein- and lactic dehydrogenase-based rapid 
diagnosis tests, or iii) polymerase chain reaction amplification of the merozoite
surface protein 2 gene, for identification of sub-microscopic parasitaemia. Other
investigations were also done as clinically indicated.
RESULTS: In 2008, nine cases of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia were diagnosed
by microscopy in 405 (2.2%) newborns. All the nine newborns had low parasite
densities (â‰¤ 50 per microlitre). In 2010, there was no case of parasitaemia by
either microscopy or rapid diagnosis tests in 522 newborns; however, 56/467 (12%)
cases of P. falciparum were detected by polymerase chain reaction.
CONCLUSION: Congenital malaria is an uncommon cause of clinical illness in
high-risk untreated newborns referred to a tertiary hospital in the first week of
life. Empirical anti-malarial drug treatment for sick newborns without laboratory
confirmation of parasitaemia is imprudent. Early referral of sick newborns to
hospitals with resources and skills for appropriate care is recommended.
