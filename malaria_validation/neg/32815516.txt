The apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum parasites is believed to rely on the
import of three-carbon phosphate compounds for use in organelle anabolic
pathways, in addition to the generation of energy and reducing power within the
organelle. We generated a series of genetic deletions in an apicoplast metabolic 
bypass line to determine which genes involved in apicoplast carbon metabolism are
required for blood-stage parasite survival and organelle maintenance. We found
that pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) is essential for organelle maintenance, but that
production of pyruvate by PyrKII is not responsible for this phenomenon.
Enzymatic characterization of PyrKII revealed activity against all NDPs and dNDPs
tested, suggesting that it may be capable of generating a broad range of
nucleotide triphosphates. Conditional mislocalization of PyrKII resulted in
decreased transcript levels within the apicoplast that preceded organelle
disruption, suggesting that PyrKII is required for organelle maintenance due to
its role in nucleotide triphosphate generation.
