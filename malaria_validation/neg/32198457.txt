In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the switch from asexual
multiplication to sexual differentiation into gametocytes is essential for
transmission to mosquitos. The transcription factor PfAP2-G is a key determinant 
of sexual commitment that orchestrates this crucial cell fate decision. Here we
identify the direct targets of PfAP2-G and demonstrate that it dynamically binds 
hundreds of sites across the genome. We find that PfAP2-G is a transcriptional
activator of early gametocyte genes, and identify differences in PfAP2-G
occupancy between gametocytes derived via next-cycle and same-cycle conversion.
Our data implicate PfAP2-G not only as a transcriptional activator of gametocyte 
genes, but also as a potential regulator of genes important for red blood cell
invasion. We also find that regulation by PfAP2-G requires interaction with a
second transcription factor, PfAP2-I. These results clarify the functional role
of PfAP2-G during sexual commitment and early gametocytogenesis.
