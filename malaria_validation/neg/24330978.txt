albimanus, a key malaria vector in Latin America.

BACKGROUND: Anopheles albimanus is a key malaria vector in the northern
neotropics. Current vector control measures in the region are based on mass
distributions of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and focal indoor residual
spraying (IRS) with pyrethroids. Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides can be
mediated by increased esterase and/or multi-function oxidase activity and/or
mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. The aim of this work was to
characterize the homologous kdr region of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene
in An. albimanus and to conduct a preliminary retrospective analysis of field
samples collected in the 1990's, coinciding with a time of intense pyrethroid
application related to agricultural and public health insect control in the
region.
METHODS: Degenerate primers were designed to amplify the homologous kdr region in
a pyrethroid-susceptible laboratory strain (Sanarate) of An. albimanus.
Subsequently, a more specific primer pair was used to amplify and sequence the
region that contains the 1014 codon associated with pyrethroid resistance in
other Anopheles spp. (L1014F, L1014S or L1014C).
RESULTS: Direct sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence of the
susceptible kdr allele in the Sanarate strain (L1014) and the presence of
homozygous-resistant kdr alleles in field-collected individuals from Mexico
(L1014F), Nicaragua (L1014C) and Costa Rica (L1014C).
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the kdr region in An. albimanus is described.
Furthermore, molecular evidence suggests the presence of kdr-type resistance in
field-collected An. albimanus in Mesoamerica in the 1990s. Further research is
needed to conclusively determine an association between the genotypes and
resistant phenotypes, and to what extent they may compromise current vector
control efforts.
