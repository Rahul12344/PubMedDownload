BACKGROUND: Deciphering the dynamics and evolution of insecticide resistance in
malaria vectors is crucial for successful vector control. This study reports an
increase of resistance intensity and a rise of multiple insecticide resistance in
Anopheles funestus in Malawi leading to reduced bed net efficacy.
METHODS: Anopheles funestus group mosquitoes were collected in southern Malawi
and the species composition, Plasmodium infection rate, susceptibility to
insecticides and molecular bases of the resistance were analysed.
RESULTS: Mosquito collection revealed a predominance of An. funestus group
mosquitoes with a high hybrid rate (12.2 %) suggesting extensive species
hybridization. An. funestus sensu stricto was the main Plasmodium vector (4.8 %
infection). Consistently high levels of resistance to pyrethroid and carbamate
insecticides were recorded and had increased between 2009 and 2014. Furthermore, 
the 2014 collection exhibited multiple insecticide resistance, notably to DDT,
contrary to 2009. Increased pyrethroid resistance correlates with reduced
efficacy of bed nets (<5 % mortality by Olyset(®) net), which can compromise
control efforts. This change in resistance dynamics is mirrored by prevalent
resistance mechanisms, firstly with increased over-expression of key pyrethroid
resistance genes (CYP6Pa/b and CYP6M7) in 2014 and secondly, detection of the
A296S-RDL dieldrin resistance mutation for the first time. However, the
L119F-GSTe2 and kdr mutations were absent.
CONCLUSIONS: Such increased resistance levels and rise of multiple resistance
highlight the need to rapidly implement resistance management strategies to
preserve the effectiveness of existing insecticide-based control interventions.
