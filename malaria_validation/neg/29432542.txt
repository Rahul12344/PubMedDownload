In many metazoan species, an unusual type of protein glycosylation, called
C-mannosylation, occurs on adhesive thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) and type
I cytokine receptors. This modification has been shown to be catalyzed by the
Caenorhabditis elegans DPY-19 protein and orthologues of the encoding gene were
found in the genome of apicomplexan parasites. Lately, the micronemal adhesin
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) was shown to be C-hexosylated in 
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Here, we demonstrate that also the micronemal 
protein MIC2 secreted by Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites is C-hexosylated. When
expressed in a mammalian cell line deficient in C-mannosylation, P. falciparum
and T. gondii Dpy19 homologs were able to modify TSR domains of the micronemal
adhesins TRAP/MIC2 family involved in parasite motility and invasion. In vitro,
the apicomplexan enzymes can transfer mannose to a WXXWXXC peptide but, in
contrast to C. elegans or mammalian C-mannosyltransferases, are inactive on a
short WXXW peptide. Since TSR domains are commonly found in apicomplexan surface 
proteins, C-mannosylation may be a common modification in this phylum.
