BACKGROUND: Plasmodium parasites need to cross the midgut and salivary gland
epithelia to complete their life cycle in the mosquito. However, our
understanding of the molecular mechanism and the mosquito genes that participate 
in this process is still very limited.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified an Anopheles gambiae epithelial
serine protease (AgESP) that is constitutively expressed in the submicrovillar
region of mosquito midgut epithelial cells and in the basal side of the salivary 
glands that is critical for Plasmodium parasites to cross these two epithelial
barriers. AgESP silencing greatly reduces Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium
falciparum midgut invasion and prevents the transcriptional activation of
gelsolin, a key regulator of actin remodeling and a reported Plasmodium agonist. 
AgESP expression is highly induced in midgut cells invaded by Plasmodium,
suggesting that this protease also participates in the apoptotic response to
invasion. In salivary gland epithelial cells, AgESP is localized on the basal
side--the surface with which sporozoites interact. AgESP expression in the
salivary gland is also induced in response to P. berghei and P. falciparum
sporozoite invasion, and AgESP silencing significantly reduces the number of
sporozoites that invade this organ.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that AgESP is required for Plasmodium parasites
to effectively traverse the midgut and salivary gland epithelial barriers.
Plasmodium parasites need to modify the actin cytoskeleton of mosquito epithelial
cells to successfully complete their life cycle in the mosquito and AgESP appears
to be a major player in the regulation of this process.
