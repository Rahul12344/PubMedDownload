Anopheles is the only genus of mosquitoes that transmit human malaria and
consequently the focus of large scale genome and transcriptome-wide association
studies. Genetic tools to define the function of the candidate genes arising from
these analyses are vital. Moreover, genome editing offers the potential to modify
Anopheles population structure at local and global scale to provide complementary
tools towards the ultimate goal of malaria elimination. Major breakthroughs in
Anopheles genetic analysis came with the development of germline transformation
and RNA interference technology. Yet, the field has been revolutionised again by 
precise genome editing now possible through site-specific nucleases. Here we
review the components of the current genetic toolkit available to study
Anopheles, focusing particularly on how these technical advances are used to gain
insight into malaria transmission and the design of genetic methods to control
Anopheles vectors.
