OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors associated with the acquisition of
antibodies against Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) - a leading
malaria vaccine candidate - in a well-consolidated agricultural settlement of the
Brazilian Amazon Region and to determine the sequence diversity of the PvDBP
ligand domain (DBP(II)) within the local malaria parasite population.
METHODS: Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were collected from 541
volunteers using a structured questionnaire. Malaria parasites were detected by
conventional microscopy and PCR, and blood collection was used for antibody
assays and molecular characterisation of DBP(II).
RESULTS: The frequency of malaria infection was 7% (6% for P. vivax and 1% for P.
falciparum), with malaria cases clustered near mosquito breeding sites. Nearly
50% of settlers had anti-PvDBP IgG antibodies, as detected by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with subject's age being the only strong predictor of
seropositivity to PvDBP. Unexpectedly, low levels of DBP(II) diversity were found
within the local malaria parasites, suggesting the existence of low gene flow
between P. vivax populations, probably due to the relative isolation of the
studied settlement.
CONCLUSION: The recognition of PvDBP by a significant proportion of the
community, associated with low levels of DBP(II) diversity among local P. vivax, 
reinforces the variety of malaria transmission patterns in communities from
frontier settlements. Such studies should provide baseline information for
antimalarial vaccines now in development.
