The neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and the pyrethroid deltamethrin, are antagonists 
of the insect Rdl GABA receptor.

A mutation in the second transmembrane domain of the GABA receptor subunit, Rdl, 
is associated with resistance to insecticides such as dieldrin and fipronil.
Molecular cloning of Rdl cDNA from a strain of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles
gambiae, which is highly resistant to dieldrin revealed this mutation (A296G) as 
well as another mutation in the third transmembrane domain (T345M). Wild-type,
A296G, T345M and A296G + T345M homomultimeric Rdl were expressed in Xenopus
laevis oocytes and their sensitivities to fipronil, deltamethrin,
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), imidacloprid and spinosad
were measured using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Spinosad and
DDT had no agonist or antagonist actions on Rdl. However, fipronil, deltamethrin 
and imidacloprid decreased GABA-evoked currents. These antagonistic actions were 
either reduced or abolished with the A296G and the A296G + T345M mutations while 
T345M alone appeared to have no significant effect. In conclusion, this study
identifies another mutation in the mosquito Rdl that is associated with
insecticide resistance. While T345M itself does not affect insecticide
sensitivity, it may serve to offset the structural impact of A296G. The present
study also highlights Rdl as a potential secondary target for neonicotinoids and 
pyrethroids. We show for the first time that deltamethrin (a pyrethroid
insecticide) and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) act directly on the
insect GABA receptor, Rdl. Our findings highlight Rdl as a potential secondary
target of pyrethroids and neonicotinoids mutations in which may contribute to
resistance to these widely used insecticides.
