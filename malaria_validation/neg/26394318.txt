Malaria remains an important public health issue all over the world. Among 5
Plasmodium species invasive to humans, Plasmodium knowlesi has been identified
most recently. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate this species from P.
malariae with the use of microscopic examination. However, P. knowlesi infection 
may be associated with rapidly increasing parasitaemia and severe clinical course
with the risk of death. Samples from Polish travellers returning from areas where
simian malaria is endemic were examined with the use of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). The small subunit of ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes was subjected to
analysis using nested PCR reaction. No positive results of P. knowlesi were
obtained. Due to morphological similarities to P. malariae, potentially severe
clinical course of infection and P. knowlesi endemic regions being a common
tourist destination, diagnostic and clinical vigilance is necessary, including
molecular methods use for precise parasite identification.
