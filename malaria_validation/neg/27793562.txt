Immunization with malaria parasites that developmentally arrest in or immediately
after the liver stage is the only way currently known to confer sterilizing
immunity in both humans and rodent models. There are various ways to attenuate
parasite development resulting in different timings of arrest, which has a
significant impact on vaccination efficiency. To understand what most impacts
vaccination efficiency, newly developed gain-of-function methods can now be used 
to generate a wide array of differently attenuated parasites. The combination of 
multiple attenuation approaches offers the potential to engineer efficiently
attenuated Plasmodium parasites and learn about their fascinating biology at the 
same time. Here we discuss recent studies and the potential of targeted parasite 
manipulation using genome editing to develop live attenuated malaria vaccines.
