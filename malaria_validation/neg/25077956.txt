BACKGROUND: Single amino acid substitutions in the voltage-gated sodium channel
associated with pyrethroid resistance constitute one of the main causative
factors of knockdown resistance in insects. The kdr gene has been observed in
several mosquito species; however, point mutations in the para gene of Aedes
aegypti populations in Myanmar have not been fully characterized. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the types and frequencies of mutations in the para
gene of Aedes aegypti collected from used tires in Yangon City, Myanmar.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined high pyrethroid resistance in Aedes
aegypti larvae at all collection sites in Yangon City, by using a simplified
knockdown bioassay. We showed that V1016G and S989P mutations were widely
distributed, with high frequencies (84.4% and 78.8%, respectively). By contrast, 
we were unable to detect I1011M (or I1011V) or L1014F mutations. F1534C mutations
were also widely distributed, but with a lower frequency than the V1016G mutation
(21.2%). High percentage of co-occurrence of the homozygous V1016G/S989P
mutations was detected (65.7%). Additionally, co-occurrence of homozygous
V1016G/F1534C mutations (2.9%) and homozygous V1016G/F1534C/S989P mutations
(0.98%) were detected in the present study.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pyrethroid insecticides were first used for malaria
control in 1992, and have since been constantly used in Myanmar. This intensive
use may explain the strong selection pressure toward Aedes aegypti, because this 
mosquito is generally a domestic and endophagic species with a preference for
indoor breeding. Extensive use of DDT for malaria control before the use of this 
chemical was banned may also explain the development of pyrethroid resistance in 
Aedes aegypti.
