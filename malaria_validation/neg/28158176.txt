The Plasmodium vivax Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites
(PvCelTOS) plays an important role in the traversal of host cells. Although
essential to PvCelTOS progress as a vaccine candidate, its genetic diversity
remains uncharted. Therefore, we investigated the PvCelTOS genetic polymorphism
in 119 field isolates from five different regions of Brazilian Amazon (Manaus,
Novo Repartimento, Porto Velho, Plácido de Castro and Oiapoque). Moreover, we
also evaluated the potential impact of non-synonymous mutations found in the
predicted structure and epitopes of PvCelTOS. The field isolates showed high
similarity (99.3% of bp) with the reference Sal-1 strain, presenting only four
Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) at positions 24A, 28A, 109A and 352C. The
frequency of synonymous C109A (82%) was higher than all others (p<0.0001).
However, the non-synonymous G28A and G352C were observed in 9.2% and 11.7%
isolates. The great majority of the isolates (79.8%) revealed complete amino acid
sequence homology with Sal-1, 10.9% presented complete homology with Brazil I and
two undescribed PvCelTOS sequences were observed in 9.2% field isolates.
Concerning the prediction analysis, the N-terminal substitution (Gly10Ser) was
predicted to be within a B-cell epitope (PvCelTOS Accession Nos. AB194053.1) and 
exposed at the protein surface, while the Val118Leu substitution was not a
predicted epitope. Therefore, our data suggest that although G28A SNP might
interfere in potential B-cell epitopes at PvCelTOS N-terminal region the gene
sequence is highly conserved among the isolates from different geographic
regions, which is an important feature to be taken into account when evaluating
its potential as a vaccine candidate.
