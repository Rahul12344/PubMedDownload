Asymptomatic and obligatory liver stage (LS) infection of Plasmodium parasites
presents an attractive target for antimalarial vaccine and drug development. Lack
of robust cellular models to study LS infection has hindered the discovery and
validation of host genes essential for intrahepatic parasite development. Here,
we present a chemically differentiated mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based LS
model, which supports complete development of Plasmodium berghei exoerythrocytic 
forms (EEFs) and can be used to define new host-parasite interactions. Using our 
model, we established that host Pnpla2, coding for adipose triglyceride lipase,
is dispensable for P. berghei EEF development. In addition, we also evaluated
in-vitro-differentiated human hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) to study LS of
P. berghei and found it to be a sub-optimal infection model. Overall, our results
present a new mouse ESC-based P. berghei LS infection model that can be utilized 
to study the impact of host genetic variation on parasite development.
