Plasmodium parasites are exposed to endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress
during their complex life cycle. To minimize oxidative damage, the parasites use 
glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) as primary antioxidants. We previously
showed that disruption of the Plasmodium berghei gamma-glutamylcysteine
synthetase (pbggcs-ko) or the glutathione reductase (pbgr-ko) genes resulted in a
significant reduction of GSH in intraerythrocytic stages, and a defect in growth 
in the pbggcs-ko parasites. In this report, time course experiments of parasite
intraerythrocytic development and morphological studies showed a growth delay
during the ring to schizont progression. Morphological analysis shows a
significant reduction in size (diameter) of trophozoites and schizonts with
increased number of cytoplasmic vacuoles in the pbggcs-ko parasites in comparison
to the wild type (WT). Furthermore, the pbggcs-ko mutants exhibited an impaired
response to oxidative stress and increased levels of nuclear DNA (nDNA) damage.
Reduced GSH levels did not result in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage or protein 
carbonylations in neither pbggcs-ko nor pbgr-ko parasites. In addition, the
pbggcs-ko mutant parasites showed an increase in mRNA expression of genes
involved in oxidative stress detoxification and DNA synthesis, suggesting a
potential compensatory mechanism to allow for parasite proliferation. These
results reveal that low GSH levels affect parasite development through the
impairment of oxidative stress reduction systems and damage to the nDNA. Our
studies provide new insights into the role of the GSH antioxidant system in the
intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium parasites, with potential translation
into novel pharmacological interventions.
