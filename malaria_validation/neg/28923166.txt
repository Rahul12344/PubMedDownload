The Fulani ethnic group has relatively better protection from Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, as reflected by fewer symptomatic cases of malaria, lower
infection rates, and lower parasite densities compared to sympatric ethnic
groups. However, the basis for this lower susceptibility to malaria by the Fulani
is unknown. The incidence of classic malaria resistance genes are lower in the
Fulani than in other sympatric ethnic populations, and targeted SNP analyses of
other candidate genes involved in the immune response to malaria have not been
able to account for the observed difference in the Fulani susceptibility to
P.falciparum. Therefore, we have performed a pilot study to examine global
transcription and DNA methylation patterns in specific immune cell populations in
the Fulani to elucidate the mechanisms that confer the lower susceptibility to
P.falciparum malaria. When we compared uninfected and infected Fulani
individuals, in contrast to uninfected and infected individuals from the
sympatric ethnic group Mossi, we observed a key difference: a strong
transcriptional response was only detected in the monocyte fraction of the
Fulani, where over 1000 genes were significantly differentially expressed upon
P.falciparum infection.
