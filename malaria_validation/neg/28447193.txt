The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV), and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the most
pathogenic viruses known to man and the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic
fever outbreaks in Africa with case fatality rates of up to 90%. Nearly 30,000
infections were observed in the latest EBOV epidemic in West Africa; previous
outbreaks were much smaller, typically only affecting less than a few hundred
people. Compared to other diseases such as AIDS or Malaria with millions of cases
annually, filovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF) is one of the neglected infectious
diseases. There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to treat EBOV 
and MARV infections; therefore, these pathogens can only be handled in maximum
containment laboratories and are classified as select agents. Under these
limitations, a very few laboratories worldwide conducted basic research and
countermeasure development for EBOV and MARV since their respective discoveries
in 1967 (MARV) and 1976 (EBOV). In this review, we discuss several vaccine
platforms against EBOV and MARV, which have been assessed for their protective
efficacy in animal models of FHF. The focus is on the most promising approaches, 
which were accelerated in clinical development (phase I-III trials) during the
EBOV epidemic in West Africa.
