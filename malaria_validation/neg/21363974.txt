Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting 
low-level parasitemia than conventional blood film microscopy. We estimated the
prevalence of congenital malaria using nested PCR amplification of the small
subunit 18S RNA gene to detect low-level parasitemia and identify Plasmodium
species in 204 mother-neonate pairs. Cord-blood parasitemia was detected in four 
babies by PCR, giving a prevalence of 2.0%. The newborns of primidgravidae were
more susceptible to congenital malaria than those of multigravidae (P < 0.0001). 
There was a strong correlation between placental malaria and congenital malaria
(odds ratio = 10.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-76.1, P = 0.0487). We conclude 
that the prevalence of congenital malaria in Calabar detected by PCR is lower
than has been reported in this environment through microscopy.
