Placental malaria, especially when complicated with intervillositis, can cause
fetal growth restriction. Transplacental glucose transport by glucose transporter
isoform 1 (GLUT-1) on the syncytiotrophoblast microvillous and basal plasma
membranes regulates fetal growth. We found that GLUT-1 expression in the
microvillous plasma membrane of Plasmodium falciparum-negative placenta biopsy
specimens was comparable to that in P. falciparum-positive placenta biopsy
specimens with or without intervillositis, whereas GLUT-1 expression in the basal
plasma membrane was lowest in P. falciparum-positive placenta biopsy specimens
with intervillositis, compared with the other 2 specimen types (P â‰¤ .0016).
GLUT-1 expression in the basal plasma membrane also correlated negatively with
monocyte infiltrate density (r = -0.43; P = .003) and positively with birth
weight (r = 0.28; P = .06). These findings suggest that intervillositis, more
than placental malaria per se, might cause fetal growth restriction, through
impaired transplacental glucose transport.
