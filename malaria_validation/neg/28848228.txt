Apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of humans and domestic animals,
including Plasmodium species (the agents of malaria) and Toxoplasma gondii, which
is responsible for toxoplasmosis. They replicate within the cells of their animal
hosts, to which they gain access using a unique parasite-driven invasion process.
At the core of the invasion machine is a structure at the interface between the
invading parasite and host cell called the moving junction (MJ) 1 . The MJ serves
as both a molecular doorway to the host cell and an anchor point enabling the
parasite to engage its motility machinery to drive the penetration of the host
cell 2 , ultimately yielding a protective vacuole 3 . The MJ is established
through self-assembly of parasite proteins at the parasite-host interface 4 .
However, it is unknown whether host proteins are subverted for MJ formation.
Here, we show that Toxoplasma parasite rhoptry neck proteins (RON2, RON4 and
RON5) cooperate to actively recruit the host CIN85, CD2AP and the ESCRT-I
components ALIX and TSG101 to the MJ during invasion. We map the interactions in 
detail and demonstrate that the parasite mimics and subverts conserved binding
interfaces with remarkable specificity. Parasite mutants unable to recruit these 
host proteins show inefficient host cell invasion in culture and attenuated
virulence in mice. This study reveals molecular mechanisms by which parasites
subvert widely conserved host machinery to force highly efficient host cell
access.
