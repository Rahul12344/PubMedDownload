Highly reactive particle-based DNA amplification was developed for the detection 
of the Pfg377 gene from P. falciparum gametocytes using functional magnetic latex
particles (MLPs) and quantum dots encapsulated polymer particles (QDs-PPs).
Firstly, MLPs were prepared from the precipitation of iron oxide, polymerization 
using initiator, and adsorption of aminodextran (AMD) so as to provide
amino-functionalized MLPs. Furthermore, amino-containing polymer particles (PPs) 
were prepared by emulsifier-free polymerization and encapsulated with fluorescent
quantum dots (QDs) for use as a signaling support. Subsequently, poly(maleic
anhydride-alt-methyl vinyl ether) (PMAMVE) copolymer was effectively used for
rapid and simple grafting of amino-modified DNA primers onto the surface of
amino-functionalized particles thereby providing a promising method for particle 
immobilization. Herein, primer-grafted particles were applied in the
amplification of the Pfg377 gene using the PCR approach. After amplification, PCR
products containing PMAMVE-grafted MLPs and QDs-PPs were separated using a magnet
and examined via a fluorescence microscope. PMAMVE-grafted particles were not
found to inhibit the PCR reaction while facilitating efficient fluorescent
detection of the PCR product. Results showed high sensitivity and specificity for
the detection of amplified Pfg377 gene within only a few steps. This procedure
represents a novel improvement to the post-amplification analysis.
