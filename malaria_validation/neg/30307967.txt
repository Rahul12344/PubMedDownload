The objective of this study was to identify potential mRNA expression changes in 
chicken livers associated with environmental exposure to
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDTs). In
particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and metabolism. We 
analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa,
for contamination by DDTs. This area predominantly uses DDT in its malaria
control program, and homes are sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes
relating to the immune system and metabolism were selected as potential genetic
biomarkers that could be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR
analysis on 39 samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and 
mRNA expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and AvBD7
(down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SQLE (up-regulated). This study shows for
the first time interesting and significant correlations between genetic material 
collected from environmentally-exposed chickens and mRNA expression of several
genes involved in immunity and metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of 
analysis on field samples from a region with high levels of environmental
contamination in detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we
observed clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes
involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid
dysregulation. These results are of interest in guiding future studies to further
elucidate the pathways involved in and clinical importance of toxicity associated
with DDT exposure from contaminated environments, to ascertain the health risk to
livestock and any subsequent risks to food security for people.
