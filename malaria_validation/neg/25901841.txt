As a newly developed assay for the detection of endogenous enzyme activity at the
single-catalytic-event level, Rolling Circle Enhanced Enzyme Activity Detection
(REEAD) has been used to measure enzyme activity in both single human cells and
malaria-causing parasites, Plasmodium sp. Current REEAD assays rely on organic
dye-tagged linear DNA probes to report the rolling circle amplification products 
(RCPs), the cost of which may hinder the widespread use of REEAD. Here we show
that a new class of activatable probes, NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), can simplify 
the REEAD assays. Easily prepared without any need for purification and capable
of large fluorescence enhancement upon hybridization, NCBs are cost-effective and
sensitive. Compared to conventional fluorescent probes, NCBs are also more
photostable. As demonstrated in reporting the human topoisomerases I (hTopI)
cleavage-ligation reaction, the proposed NCBs suggest a read-out format
attractive for future REEAD-based diagnostics.
