Cryptosporidium is an apicomplexan parasite that causes the disease
cryptosporidiosis in humans, livestock, and other vertebrates. Much of the
knowledge on Cryptosporidium diversity is derived from 18S rRNA gene (18S rDNA)
phylogenies. Eukaryote genomes generally have multiple 18S rDNA copies that
evolve in concert, which is necessary for the accurate inference of phylogenetic 
relationships. However, 18S rDNA copies in some genomes evolve by a
birth-and-death process that can result in sequence divergence among copies. Most
notably, divergent 18S rDNA paralogs in the apicomplexan Plasmodium share only
89-95% sequence similarity, encode structurally distinct rRNA molecules, and are 
expressed at different life cycle stages. In the present study, Cryptosporidium
18S rDNA was amplified from 28/72 (38.9%) eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus).
Phylogenetic analyses showed the co-occurrence of two 18S rDNA types, Type A and 
Type B, in 26 chipmunks, and Type B clustered with a sequence previously
identified as Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype II. Types A and B had a sister
group relationship but shared less than 93% sequence similarity. In contrast,
actin and heat shock protein 70 gene sequences were homogeneous in samples with
both Types A and B present. It was therefore concluded that Types A and B are
divergent 18S rDNA paralogs in Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype II. Substitution
patterns in Types A and B were consistent with functionally constrained
evolution; however, Type B evolved more rapidly than Type A and had a higher G+C 
content (46.3% versus 41.0%). Oocysts of Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype II
measured 4.17 μm (3.73-5.04 μm) × 3.94 μm (3.50-4.98 μm) with a length-to-width
ratio of 1.06 ± 0.06 μm, and infection occurred naturally in the jejunum, cecum, 
and colon of eastern chipmunks. The findings of this study have implications for 
the use of 18S rDNA sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships.
