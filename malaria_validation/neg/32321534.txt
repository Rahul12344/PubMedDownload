BACKGROUND: Malaria control in Tanzania currently relies primarily on
long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying, alongside effective 
case management and behaviour change communication. This study explored opinions 
of key stakeholders on the national progress towards malaria elimination, the
potential of currently available vector control interventions in helping achieve 
elimination by 2030, and the need for alternative interventions that could be
used to supplement malaria elimination efforts in Tanzania.
METHODS: In this exploratory qualitative study, Focus group discussions were held
with policy-makers, regulators, research scientists and community members.
Malaria control interventions discussed were: (a) improved housing, (b) larval
source management, (c) mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin to reduce
vector densities, (d) release of modified mosquitoes, including genetically
modified or irradiated mosquitoes, (e) targeted spraying of mosquito swarms, and 
(f) spatial repellents.
RESULTS: Larval source management and spatial repellents were widely supported
across all stakeholder groups, while insecticide-spraying of mosquito swarms was 
the least preferred. Support for MDA with ivermectin was high among policy
makers, regulators and research scientists, but encountered opposition among
community members, who instead expressed strong support for programmes to improve
housing for poor people in high transmission areas. Policy makers, however,
challenged the idea of government-supported housing improvement due to its
perceived high costs. Techniques of mosquito modification, specifically those
involving gene drives, were viewed positively by community members, policy makers
and regulators, but encountered a high degree of scepticism among scientists.
Overall, policy-makers, regulators and community members trusted scientists to
provide appropriate advice for decision-making.
CONCLUSION: Stakeholder opinions regarding alternative malaria interventions were
divergent except for larval source management and spatial repellents, for which
there was universal support. MDA with ivermectin, housing improvement and
modified mosquitoes were also widely supported, though each faced concerns from
at least one stakeholder group. While policy-makers, regulators and community
members all noted their reliance on scientists to make informed decisions, their 
reasoning on the benefits and disadvantages of specific interventions included
factors beyond technical efficiency. This study suggests the need to encourage
and strengthen dialogue between research scientists, policy makers, regulators
and communities regarding new interventions.
