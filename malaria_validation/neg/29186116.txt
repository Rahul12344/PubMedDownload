Malaria is among the most serious infectious diseases affecting humans,
accounting for approximately half a million deaths each year. Plasmodium
falciparum causes most life-threatening cases of malaria. Acquired immunity to
malaria is inefficient, even after repeated exposure to P. falciparum, but the
immune regulatory mechanisms used by P. falciparum remain largely unknown. Here
we show that P. falciparum uses immune inhibitory receptors to achieve immune
evasion. RIFIN proteins are products of a polymorphic multigene family comprising
approximately 150-200 genes per parasite genome that are expressed on the surface
of infected erythrocytes. We found that a subset of RIFINs binds to either
leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) or leucocyte-associated
immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1). LILRB1-binding RIFINs inhibit activation 
of LILRB1-expressing B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, P.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes isolated from patients with severe malaria were 
more likely to interact with LILRB1 than erythrocytes from patients with
non-severe malaria, although an extended study with larger sample sizes is
required to confirm this finding. Our results suggest that P. falciparum has
acquired multiple RIFINs to evade the host immune system by targeting immune
inhibitory receptors.
