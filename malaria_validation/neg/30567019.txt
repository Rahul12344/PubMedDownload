OBJECTIVE: To compare the genetic diversity of imported Plasmodium falciparum by 
Polyα and TAA87 microsatellite markers in Southeast Asian and African
geographical isolates.
METHODS: Ninety-two and 126 filter paper samples from patients infected with P.
falciparum from Southeast Asia (Myanmar) and Africa (Ghana) were collected,
respectively. Two neutral microsatellite loci, Polyα and TAA87 were amplified by 
PCR. The length of PCR fragments was detected by capillary electrophoresis. The
allele frequency and expected heterozygosity (He) were calculated by Excel 2010
and GenALEx 6.0 software.
RESULTS: A total of 146 P. falciparum samples were analyzed as single infection
samples with a total of 26 alleles in locus Polyα and 12 alleles in locus TAA87. 
The mean He value of the two loci was 0.86 ± 0.02. Ten alleles in locus Polyα and
8 alleles in locus TAA87 were distributed in Myanmar isolates, with the He values
of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. Fifteen alleles in locus Polyα and 11 in locus
TAA87 were detected in Ghana isolates, with the He values of 0.91 and 0.86
respectively. In addition, the haplotype of 174 bp (Polyα) and 113 bp (TAA87)
were only detected in Myanmar isolates with more than 17% gene frequency, whereas
they were absent in Ghana isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The two different geographical sources of imported P. falciparum
strains have different allele frequencies and haplotypes at the two neutral
microsatellite markers, Polyα and TAA87. Therefore, these two microsatellite loci
may be considered as the potential molecular marker candidates for identifying P.
falciparum strains with different geographical sources.

Publisher: [摘要] 目的 比较东南亚与非洲输入性恶性疟原虫在Polyα、TAA87两个微卫星位点多态性的差异。方法 收集缅甸 (92份) 和加纳
(126份) 输入性恶性疟病例血液样本共218份, 对所收集样本的Polyα、TAA87微卫星位点进行片段扩增, 毛细管电泳检测扩增产物长度, 应用Excel
2010和GenALEx 6.0软件计算等位基因频率和期望杂合度。结果 共获得
146例单一感染样本的有效数据。Polyα、TAA87两个微卫星位点分别检测到16个和12个等位基因型, 2个微卫星位点的 平均期望杂合度为0.86 ±
0.02。缅甸输入样本在Polyα及TAA87位点的等位基因数分别为10个和8个, 期望杂合度分别 为0.86和0.81;
加纳输入样本在Polyα及TAA87位点的等位基因数分别为15个和11个, 期望杂合度分别为0.91和0.86。 此外, 长度为174 bp (Polyα)
和113 bp (TAA87) 的等位基因仅在东南亚缅甸样本中测出, 其等位基因频率占17%以上。结论
东南亚与非洲输入性恶性疟原虫在Polyα、TAA87两个微卫星位点具有不同等位基因类型和数量, 建议将这两个位 点作为区分不同地理来源疟原虫的候选基因。.
