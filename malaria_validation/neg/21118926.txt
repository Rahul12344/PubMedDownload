The 200-kD merozoite surface protein of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-1) is one of the 
leading vaccine candidates against P. vivax malaria. However, the gene encoding
PvMSP-1 (pvmsp1) is highly polymorphic and is a major obstacle to effective
vaccine development. To further understand polymorphism in pvmsp1, we obtained 30
full-length pvmsp1 sequences from southeastern Turkey. Comparative analysis of
sequences from Turkey and other areas showed substantially limited polymorphism. 
Substitutions were found at 280 and 162 amino acid sites in samples from other
regions and those from Turkey, respectively. Eight substitutions were unique to
Turkey. In one of them, D/E at position 1706 in the C-terminal 19-kD region, the 
K/E change at 1709 was the only polymorphism previously known. Limited diversity 
was also observed in microsatellites. Data suggest a recent population bottleneck
in Turkey that may have obscured a signature for balancing selection in the
C-terminal 42-kD region, which was otherwise detectable in other areas.
