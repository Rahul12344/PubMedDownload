A fundamental binary decision is made by malaria parasites at every asexual cycle
in the blood between further proliferation and differentiation into gametocytes, 
the mosquito transmissible stages. Recent studies on Plasmodium epigenetic
regulation, transcriptional control and genetic basis of gametocyte production
are merging today to unveil players and propose molecular mechanisms of this key 
branch point in the malaria parasite life cycle.
