Ookinetes, one of the motile and invasive forms of the malaria parasite, rely on 
gliding motility in order to establish an infection in the mosquito host. Here we
characterize the protein PBANKA_0407300 which is conserved in the Plasmodium
genus but lacks significant similarity to proteins of other eukaryotes. It is
expressed in gametocytes and throughout the invasive mosquito stages of P.
berghei, but is absent from asexual blood stages. Mutants lacking the protein
developed morphologically normal ookinetes that were devoid of productive
motility although some stretching movement could be detected. We therefore named 
the protein Ookinete Motility Deficient (OMD). Several key factors known to be
involved in motility however were normally expressed and localized in the mutant.
Importantly, the mutant failed to establish an infection in the mosquito which
resulted in a total malaria transmission blockade.
