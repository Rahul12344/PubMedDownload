The rapid emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites during the course of an
infection remains a major challenge for providing accurate treatment guidelines. 
This is particularly important in cases of malaria treatment failure. Using a
previously well-characterized case of malaria treatment failure, we show the
utility of using next-generation sequencing for early detection of the rise and
selection of a previously reported atovaquone-proguanil (malarone) drug
resistance-associated mutation.
