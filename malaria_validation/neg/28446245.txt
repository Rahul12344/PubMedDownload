BACKGROUND: Ticks cause massive damage to livestock and vaccines are one
sustainable substitute for the acaricides currently heavily used to control
infestations. To guide antigen discovery for a vaccine that targets the gamut of 
parasitic strategies mediated by tick saliva and enables immunological memory, we
exploited a transcriptome constructed from salivary glands from all stages of
Rhipicephalus microplus ticks feeding on genetically tick-resistant and
susceptible bovines.
RESULTS: Different levels of host anti-tick immunity affected gene expression in 
tick salivary glands; we thus selected four proteins encoded by genes weakly
expressed in ticks attempting to feed on resistant hosts or otherwise abundantly 
expressed in ticks fed on susceptible hosts; these sialoproteins mediate four
functions of parasitism deployed by male ticks and that do not induce antibodies 
in naturally infected, susceptible bovines. We then evaluated in tick-susceptible
heifers an alum-adjuvanted vaccine formulated with recombinant proteins. Parasite
performance (i.e. weight and numbers of females finishing their parasitic cycle) 
and titres of antigen-specific antibodies were significantly reduced or
increased, respectively, in vaccinated versus control heifers, conferring an
efficacy of 73.2%; two of the antigens were strong immunogens, rich in predicted 
T-cell epitopes and challenge infestations boosted antibody responses against
them.
CONCLUSION: Mining sialotranscriptomes guided by the immunity of tick-resistant
hosts selected important targets and infestations boosted immune memory against
salivary antigens.
