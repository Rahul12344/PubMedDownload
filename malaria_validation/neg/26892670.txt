Conditional genome engineering in the human malaria pathogen Plasmodium
falciparum remains highly challenging. Here we describe a strategy for facile and
rapid functional analysis of genes using an approach based on the Cre/lox system 
and tailored for organisms with short and few introns. Our method allows the
conditional, site-specific removal of genomic sequences of essential and
non-essential genes by placing loxP sites into a short synthetic intron to
produce a module (loxPint) can be placed anywhere in open reading frames without 
compromising protein expression. When duplicated, the loxPint module serves as an
intragenic recombineering point that can be used for the fusion of gene elements 
to reporters or the conditional introduction of point mutations. We demonstrate
the robustness and versatility of the system by targeting the P. falciparum
merozoite surface protein 1 gene (msp1), which has previously proven refractory
to genetic interrogation, and the parasite exported kinase FIKK10.1.
