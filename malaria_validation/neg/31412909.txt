scRNA-seq dataset integration occurs in different contexts, such as the
identification of cell type-specific differences in gene expression across
conditions or species, or batch effect correction. We present scAlign, an
unsupervised deep learning method for data integration that can incorporate
partial, overlapping, or a complete set of cell labels, and estimate per-cell
differences in gene expression across datasets. scAlign performance is
state-of-the-art and robust to cross-dataset variation in cell type-specific
expression and cell type composition. We demonstrate that scAlign reveals gene
expression programs for rare populations of malaria parasites. Our framework is
widely applicable to integration challenges in other domains.
