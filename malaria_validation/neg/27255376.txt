BACKGROUND: Humoral immune responses against proteins of asexual blood-stage
malaria parasites have been associated with clinical immunity. However,
variations in the antibody-driven responses may be associated with a genetic
component of the human host. The objective of the present study was to evaluate
the influence of co-stimulatory molecule gene polymorphisms of the immune system 
on the magnitude of the humoral immune response against a Plasmodium vivax
vaccine candidate antigen.
METHODS: Polymorphisms in the CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, CD40, CD86 and BLYS genes of 178
subjects infected with P. vivax in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon were
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP). The levels of IgM, total IgG and IgG subclasses specific for ICB2-5, 
i.e., the N-terminal portion of P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP-1),
were determined by enzyme-linked immuno assay. The associations between the
polymorphisms and the antibody response were assessed by means of logistic
regression models.
RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing, the IgG1 levels were
significantly higher in individuals recessive for the single nucleotide
polymorphism rs3116496 in CD28 (p = 0.00004). Furthermore, the interaction
between CD28 rs35593994 and BLYS rs9514828 had an influence on the IgM levels
(p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the hypothesis that
polymorphisms in the genes of co-stimulatory components of the immune system can 
contribute to a natural antibody-driven response against P. vivax antigens.
