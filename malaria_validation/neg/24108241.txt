Apicomplexan parasites invade host cells by forming a ring-like junction with the
cell surface and actively sliding through the junction inside an intracellular
vacuole. Apical membrane antigen 1 is conserved in apicomplexans and a
long-standing malaria vaccine candidate. It is considered to have multiple
important roles during host cell penetration, primarily in structuring the
junction by interacting with the rhoptry neck 2 protein and transducing the force
generated by the parasite motor during internalization. Here, we generate
Plasmodium sporozoites and merozoites and Toxoplasma tachyzoites lacking apical
membrane antigen 1, and find that the latter two are impaired in host cell
attachment but the three display normal host cell penetration through the
junction. Therefore, apical membrane antigen 1, rather than an essential invasin,
is a dispensable adhesin of apicomplexan zoites. These genetic data have
implications on the use of apical membrane antigen 1 or the apical membrane
antigen 1-rhoptry neck 2 interaction as targets of intervention strategies
against malaria or other diseases caused by apicomplexans.
