Drug resistance is a costly consequence of pathogen evolution and a major concern
in public health. In this review, we show how population genetics can be used to 
study the evolution of drug resistance and also how drug resistance evolution is 
informative as an evolutionary model system. We highlight five examples from
diverse organisms with particular focus on: (i) identifying drug resistance loci 
in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using the genomic signatures of
selective sweeps, (ii) determining the role of epistasis in drug resistance
evolution in influenza, (iii) quantifying the role of standing genetic variation 
in the evolution of drug resistance in HIV, (iv) using drug resistance mutations 
to study clonal interference dynamics in tuberculosis and (v) analysing the
population structure of the core and accessory genome of Staphylococcus aureus to
understand the spread of methicillin resistance. Throughout this review, we
discuss the uses of sequence data and population genetic theory in studying the
evolution of drug resistance.
