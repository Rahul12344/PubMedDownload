BACKGROUND: In recent years, the genus Asaia (Rhodospirillales: Acetobacteraceae)
has been isolated from different Anopheles species and presented as a promising
tool to combat malaria. This bacterium has unique features such as presence in
different organs of mosquitoes (midgut, salivary glands and reproductive organs) 
of female and male mosquitoes and vertical and horizontal transmission. These
specifications lead to the possibility of introducing Asaia as a robust candidate
for malaria vector control via paratransgenesis technology. Several studies have 
been performed on the microbiota of Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in 
Iran and the Middle East to find a suitable candidate for controlling the malaria
based on paratransgenesis approaches. The present study is the first report of
isolation, biochemical and molecular characterization of the genus Asaia within
five different Anopheles species which originated from different zoogeographical 
zones in the south, east, and north of Iran.
METHODS: Mosquitoes originated from field-collected and laboratory-reared
colonies of five Anopheles spp. Adult mosquitoes were anesthetized; their midguts
were isolated by dissection, followed by grinding the midgut contents which were 
then cultured in enrichment broth media and later in CaCO3 agar plates
separately. Morphological, biochemical and physiological characterization were
carried out after the appearance of colonies. For molecular confirmation,
selected colonies were cultured, their DNAs were extracted and PCR was performed 
on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using specific newly designed primers.
RESULTS: Morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular results
indicated that all isolates are members of the genus Asaia.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous opinions, our findings show that Asaia bacteria
are present in both insectary-reared colonies and field-collected mosquitoes and 
can be isolated by simple and specific methods. Furthermore, with respect to the 
fact that we isolated Asaia within the different Anopheles specimens from
distinct climatic and zoogeographical regions, it is promising and may be
concluded that species of this genus can tolerate the complicated environmental
conditions of the vector-borne diseases endemic regions. Therefore, it can be
considered as a promising target in paratransgenesis and vector control programs.
However, we suggest that introducing the new technologies such as next generation
sequencing and robust in silico approaches may pave the way to find a unique
biomarker for rapid and reliable differentiation of the Asaia species.
