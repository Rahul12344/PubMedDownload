Protozoan parasites, such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium,
trypanosomes, and Leishmania, are a major cause of disease in both humans and
other animals, highlighting the need to understand the full spectrum of
strategies used by the host immune system to sense and respond to parasite
infection. Although type II interferon (IFN-γ) has long been recognized as an
essential antiparasite immune effector, much less is known about the role of type
I interferons (IFN-α and -β) in host defense, particularly in vivo. Recent
studies are reviewed which collectively highlight that type I IFN can be induced 
in response to parasite infection and influence the outcome of infection.
