Chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is determined by the
mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene. The point
mutation at codon 76 (K76T), which has been observed in more than 91% of P.
falciparum isolates in India, is the major determinant of CQ resistance. To
overcome the limitations and challenges of traditional methods, in this
investigation we developed an easy to use loop mediated isothermal amplification 
(LAMP) protocol for rapid detection of the K76T mutation associated with CQ
resistance in P. falciparum with naked eye visualization. In- house designed
primers were synthesized and optimized to specifically distinguish the CQ
resistant mutants of P. falciparum. The LAMP reaction was optimal at 61 °C for
60 min and calcein dye was added prior to amplification to enable visual
detection. We demonstrate the detection limit of <2 ng/μl respectively,
supporting the high sensitivity of this calcein based LAMP method. To the best of
our knowledge this is the first report on the establishment of an easy, reliable 
and cost effective LAMP assay for rapid and specific detection of highly CQ
resistance in P. falciparum malaria.
