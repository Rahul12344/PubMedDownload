Histomonas meleagridis is the causative agent of histomonosis, a disease of
gallinaceous fowl characterized by necrotic typhlitis, hepatitis, and high
mortality. To develop a rapid and sensitive method for specific detection of H.
meleagridis, an assay based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
targeting the 18S rRNA gene was established. The detection limit of the LAMP
assay was 10 copies for standard plasmids containing an 18S rRNA gene fragment,
which was superior to that of a classical PCR method. Specificity tests revealed 
that there was no cross-reaction with other protozoa such as Trichomonas
gallinae, Blastocytis sp, Tetratrichomonas gallinarum, Plasmodium gallinaceum,
Toxoplasma gondii, Eimeria tenella, Leucocytozoon caulleryi and Leucocytozoon
sabrazesi. The assay was evaluated for its diagnostic utility using liver and
caeca samples collected from suspected field cases, the detection rate was 100
and 97.92%, respectively. These results indicate that the LAMP assay may be a
useful tool for rapid detection and identification of H. meleagridis in poultry.
