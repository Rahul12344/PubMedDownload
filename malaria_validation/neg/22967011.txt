BACKGROUND: High-throughput molecular biology techniques yield vast amounts of
data, often by detecting small portions of ribonucleotides corresponding to
specific identifiers. Existing bioinformatic methodologies categorize and compare
these elements using inferred descriptive annotation given this sequence
information irrespective of the fact that it may not be representative of the
identifier as a whole.
RESULTS: All annotations, no matter the granularity, can be aligned to genomic
sequences and therefore annotated by genomic intervals. We have developed
AbsIDconvert, a methodology for converting between genomic identifiers by first
mapping them onto a common universal coordinate system using an interval tree
which is subsequently queried for overlapping identifiers. AbsIDconvert has many 
potential uses, including gene identifier conversion, identification of features 
within a genomic region, and cross-species comparisons. The utility is
demonstrated in three case studies: 1) comparative genomic study mapping
plasmodium gene sequences to corresponding human and mosquito transcriptional
regions; 2) cross-species study of Incyte clone sequences; and 3) analysis of
human Ensembl transcripts mapped by AffymetrixÂ®; and Agilent microarray probes.
AbsIDconvert currently supports ID conversion of 53 species for a given list of
input identifiers, genomic sequence, or genome intervals.
CONCLUSION: AbsIDconvert provides an efficient and reliable mechanism for
conversion between identifier domains of interest. The flexibility of this tool
allows for custom definition identifier domains contingent upon the availability 
and determination of a genomic mapping interval. As the genomes and the sequences
for genetic elements are further refined, this tool will become increasingly
useful and accurate. AbsIDconvert is freely available as a web application or
downloadable as a virtual machine at: http://bioinformatics.louisville.edu/abid/.
