Avian malaria parasites are prevalent around the world and infect a wide
diversity of bird species. Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of
high-quality draft genome sequences for two avian malaria species, Plasmodium
relictum and Plasmodium gallinaceum We identify 50 genes that are specific to
avian malaria, located in an otherwise conserved core of the genome that shares
gene synteny with all other sequenced malaria genomes. Phylogenetic analysis
suggests that the avian malaria species form an outgroup to the mammalian
Plasmodium species, and using amino acid divergence between species, we estimate 
the avian- and mammalian-infective lineages diverged in the order of 10 million
years ago. Consistent with their phylogenetic position, we identify orthologs of 
genes that had previously appeared to be restricted to the clades of parasites
containing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, the species with the
greatest impact on human health. From these orthologs, we explore differential
diversifying selection across the genus and show that the avian lineage is
remarkable in the extent to which invasion-related genes are evolving. The
subtelomeres of the P. relictum and P. gallinaceum genomes contain several novel 
gene families, including an expanded surf multigene family. We also identify an
expansion of reticulocyte binding protein homologs in P. relictum, and within
these proteins, we detect distinct regions that are specific to nonhuman primate,
humans, rodent, and avian hosts. For the first time in the Plasmodium lineage, we
find evidence of transposable elements, including several hundred fragments of
LTR-retrotransposons in both species and an apparently complete
LTR-retrotransposon in the genome of P. gallinaceum.
