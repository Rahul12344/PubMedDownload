The incompleteness of proteome structure and function annotation is a critical
problem for biologists and, in particular, severely limits interpretation of
high-throughput and next-generation experiments. We have developed a proteome
annotation pipeline based on structure prediction, where function and structure
annotations are generated using an integration of sequence comparison, fold
recognition, and grid-computing-enabled de novo structure prediction. We predict 
protein domain boundaries and three-dimensional (3D) structures for protein
domains from 94 genomes (including human, Arabidopsis, rice, mouse, fly, yeast,
Escherichia coli, and worm). De novo structure predictions were distributed on a 
grid of more than 1.5 million CPUs worldwide (World Community Grid). We generated
significant numbers of new confident fold annotations (9% of domains that are
otherwise unannotated in these genomes). We demonstrate that predicted structures
can be combined with annotations from the Gene Ontology database to predict new
and more specific molecular functions.
