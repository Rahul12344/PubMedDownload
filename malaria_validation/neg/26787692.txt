Parthenin and parthenolide are natural products that are closely related in
structure to artemisinin, which is also a sesquiterpene lactone (SQL) and one of 
the most important antimalarial drugs available. Parthenin, like artemisinin, has
an effect onPlasmodiumblood stage development. We extended the evaluation of
parthenin as a potential therapeutic for the transmissible stages ofPlasmodium
falciparumas it transitions between human and mosquito, with the aim of gaining
potential mechanistic insight into the inhibitory activity of this compound. We
posited that if parthenin targets different biological pathways in the parasite, 
this in turn could pave the way for the development of druggable compounds that
could prevent the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites. We examined
parthenin's effect on male gamete activation and the ookinete-to-oocyst
transition in the mosquito as well as on stage V gametocytes that are present in 
peripheral blood. Parthenin arrested parasite development for each of the stages 
tested. The broad inhibitory properties of parthenin on the evaluated parasite
stages may suggest different mechanisms of action between parthenin and
artemisinin. Parthenin's cytotoxicity notwithstanding, its demonstrated activity 
in this study suggests that structurally related SQLs with a better safety
profile deserve further exploration. We used our battery of assays to test
parthenolide, which has a more compelling safety profile. Parthenolide
demonstrated activity nearly identical to that of parthenin againstP. falciparum,
highlighting its potential as a possible transmission-blocking drug scaffold. We 
discuss the context of the evidence with respect to the next steps toward
expanding the current antimalarial arsenal.
