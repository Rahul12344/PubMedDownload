Artemisinin, the endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone, is an effective antimalarial
drug isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. Due to its
effectiveness against multi-drug-resistant cerebral malaria, it becomes the
essential components of the artemisinin-based combination therapies which are
recommended by the World Health Organization as the preferred choice for malaria 
tropica treatments. To date, plant A. annua is still the main commercial source
of artemisinin. Although semi-synthesis of artemisinin via artemisinic acid in
yeast is feasible at present, another promising approach to reduce the price of
artemisinin is using plant metabolic engineering to obtain a higher content of
artemisinin in transgenic plants. In the past years, an Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation system of A. annua has been established by which a number of genes
related to artemisinin biosynthesis have been successfully transferred into A.
annua plants. In this review, the progress on increasing artemisinin content in
A. annua by transgenic approach and its future prospect are summarized and
discussed.
