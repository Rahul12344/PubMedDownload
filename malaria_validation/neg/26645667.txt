BACKGROUND: Studies of non-model species are important for understanding the
molecular processes underpinning phenotypic variation under natural ecological
conditions. The common buzzard (Buteo buteo; Aves: Accipitriformes) is a
widespread and common Eurasian raptor with three distinct plumage morphs that
differ in several fitness-related traits, including parasite infestation. To
provide a genomic resource for plumage polymorphic birds in general and to search
for candidate genes relating to fitness, we generated a transcriptome from a
single dead buzzard specimen plus easily accessible, minimally invasive samples
from live chicks.
RESULTS: We not only de novo assembled a near-complete buzzard transcriptome, but
also obtained a significant fraction of the transcriptome of its malaria-like
parasite, Leucocytozoon buteonis. By identifying melanogenesis-related
transcripts that are differentially expressed in light ventral and dark dorsal
feathers, but which are also expressed in other regions of the body, we also
identified a suite of candidate genes that could be associated with fitness
differences among the morphs. These include several immune-related genes,
providing a plausible link between melanisation and parasite load. qPCR analysis 
of a subset of these genes revealed significant differences between ventral and
dorsal feathers and an additional effect of morph.
CONCLUSION: This new resource provides preliminary insights into genes that could
be involved in fitness differences between the buzzard colour morphs, and should 
facilitate future studies of raptors and their malaria-like parasites.
