BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity of ABO blood, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency and haemoglobin type and their ability to protect against
malaria vary geographically, ethnically and racially. No study has been carried
out in populations resident in malaria regions in western Kenya.
METHOD: A total of 574 malaria cases (severe malaria anaemia, SMA = 137 and
non-SMA = 437) seeking treatment at Vihiga County and Referral Hospital in
western Kenya, were enrolled and screened for ABO blood group, G6PD deficiency
and haemoglobin genotyped in a hospital-based cross-sectional study.
RESULT: When compared to blood group O, blood groups A, AB and B were not
associated with SMA (P = 0.380, P = 0.183 and P = 0.464, respectively). Further
regression analysis revealed that the carriage of the intermediate status of G6PD
was associated with risk to SMA (OR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.029-2.266, P = 0.035).
There was, however, no association between AS and SS with severe malaria anaemia.
Co-occurrence of both haemoglobin type and G6PD i.e. the AA/intermediate was
associated with risk to SMA (OR = 1.536, 95%CI = 1.007-2.343, P = 0.046) while
the carriage of the AS/normal G6PD was associated with protection against SMA
(OR = 0.337, 95%CI = 0.156-0.915, P = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that blood group genotypes do not have influence 
on malaria disease outcome in this region. Children in Vihiga with blood group O 
have some protection against malaria. However, the intermediate status of G6PD is
associated with risk of SMA. Further, co-inheritance of sickle cell and G6PD
status are important predictors of malaria disease outcome. This implies
combinatorial gene function in influencing disease outcome.
