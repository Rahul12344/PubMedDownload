BACKGROUND: The ABO and the Rhesus blood group systems, as well as various
abnormal haemoglobin (Hb) variants (haemoglobinopathies) are known to influence
malaria parasite carriage and disease severity in individuals living in malaria
endemic areas. This study identified the blood group and Hb variant distribution 
and Plasmodium falciparum infection status of afebrile individuals living in
southern Ghana.
METHODS: Afebrile participants were recruited from Obom (358) in the Greater
Accra Region and Ewim (100) and Simiw (329) in the Central Region of Ghana.
Venous blood (1 ml) was collected into EDTA vacutainer tubes. Three 20 μl drops
of blood were used for blood group analysis using the tile method. Another 500 μl
aliquot was used for the qualitative sickling test using sodium metabisulphite
and haemoglobin electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 μl of whole
blood and used in P. falciparum species-specific PCR.
RESULTS: The most abundant blood group and abnormal haemoglobin variant in both
sites was blood group O + (47.4%) and HbAS (15.8%). A total of 13 (1.7%) of the
participants had full haemoglobinopathies (SS, SC and CC), whilst 196 (25.4%)
were carriers (AS and AC). Although there was a significantly higher prevalence
of sickling positive participants from the Central Region, genotyping identified 
a similar prevalence of each of the abnormal haemoglobin genes in both sites.
Asymptomatic parasite carriage estimated by PCR was 40.9% in the Central Region
and 41.8% in the Greater Accra Region.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic carriage of P. falciparum parasite in the study
population was not associated with any particular blood group variant or
haemoglobin genotype.
