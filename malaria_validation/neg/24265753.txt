Plasmodium Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase (CDPK1) is required for the
development of sexual stages in the mosquito. In addition, it is proposed to play
an essential role in the parasite's invasive stages possibly through the
regulation of the actinomyosin motor and micronemal secretion. We demonstrate
that Plasmodium berghei CDPK1 is dispensable in the parasite's erythrocytic and
pre-erythrocytic stages. We successfully disrupted P. berghei CDPK1 (PbCDPK1) by 
homologous recombination. The recovery of erythrocytic stage parasites lacking
PbCDPK1 (PbCDPK1-) demonstrated that PbCDPK1 is not essential for erythrocytic
invasion or intra-erythrocytic development. To study PbCDPK1's role in
sporozoites and liver stage parasites, we generated a conditional mutant (CDPK1
cKO). Phenotypic characterization of CDPK1 cKO sporozoites demonstrated that
CDPK1 is redundant or dispensable for the invasion of mammalian hepatocytes, the 
egress of parasites from infected hepatocytes and through the subsequent
erythrocytic cycle. We conclude that P. berghei CDPK1 plays an essential role
only in the mosquito sexual stages.
