Replication of Plasmodium in reticulocytes can occur without hemozoin formation, 
resulting in chloroquine resistance.

Most studies on malaria-parasite digestion of hemoglobin (Hb) have been performed
using P. falciparum maintained in mature erythrocytes, in vitro. In this study,
we examine Plasmodium Hb degradation in vivo in mice, using the parasite P.
berghei, and show that it is possible to create mutant parasites lacking enzymes 
involved in the initial steps of Hb proteolysis. These mutants only complete
development in reticulocytes and mature into both schizonts and gametocytes. Hb
degradation is severely impaired and large amounts of undigested Hb remains in
the reticulocyte cytoplasm and in vesicles in the parasite. The mutants produce
little or no hemozoin (Hz), the detoxification by-product of Hb degradation.
Further, they are resistant to chloroquine, an antimalarial drug that interferes 
with Hz formation, but their sensitivity to artesunate, also thought to be
dependent on Hb degradation, is retained. Survival in reticulocytes with reduced 
or absent Hb digestion may imply a novel mechanism of drug resistance. These
findings have implications for drug development against human-malaria parasites, 
such as P. vivax and P. ovale, which develop inside reticulocytes.
