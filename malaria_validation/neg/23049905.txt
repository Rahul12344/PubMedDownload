A completely effective vaccine for malaria (one of the major infectious diseases 
worldwide) is not yet available; different membrane proteins involved in
parasite-host interactions have been proposed as candidates for designing it. It 
has been found that proteins encoded by the merozoite surface protein (msp)-7
multigene family are antibody targets in natural infection; the nucleotide
diversity of three Pvmsp-7 genes was thus analyzed in a Colombian parasite
population. By contrast with P. falciparum msp-7 loci and ancestral P. vivax
msp-7 genes, specie-specific duplicates of the latter specie display high genetic
variability, generated by single nucleotide polymorphisms, repeat regions, and
recombination. At least three major allele types are present in Pvmsp-7C,
Pvmsp-7H and Pvmsp-7I and positive selection seems to be operating on the central
region of these msp-7 genes. Although this region has high genetic polymorphism, 
the C-terminus (Pfam domain ID: PF12948) is conserved and could be an important
candidate when designing a subunit-based antimalarial vaccine.
