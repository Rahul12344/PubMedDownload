Malaria parasites induce complex cellular and clinical phenotypes, including
anemia, cerebral malaria and death in a wide range of mammalian hosts. Host genes
and parasite 'toxins' have been implicated in malarial disease, but the
contribution of parasite genes remains to be fully defined. Here we assess
disease in BALB/c mice and Wistar rats infected by the rodent malaria parasite
Plasmodium berghei with a gene knock out for merozoite surface protein (MSP) 7.
MSP7 is not essential for infection but in P. falciparum, it enhances erythrocyte
invasion by 20%. In vivo, as compared to wild type, the P. berghei Δmsp7 mutant
is associated with an abrogation of death and a decrease from 3% to 2% in peak,
circulating parasitemia. The Δmsp7 mutant is also associated with less anemia and
modest increase in the size of follicles in the spleen. Together these data show 
that deletion of a single parasite invasion ligand modulates blood stage disease,
as measured by death and anemia. This work is the first to assess the
contribution of a gene present in all plasmodial species in severe disease.
