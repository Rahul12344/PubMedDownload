The roots of Eurycoma longifolia have been used in many countries of Southeast
Asia to alleviate various diseases including malaria, dysentery, sexual
insufficiency, and rheumatism. Although numerous studies have reported the
pharmacological properties of E. longifolia, the mode of action of the
anti-inflammatory activity has not been elucidated. Bioguided isolation of NF-κB 
inhibitors using an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene assay led to the
identification of a new quassinoid, eurycomalide C (1), together with 27 known
compounds including 11 quassinoids (2-12), six alkaloids (13-18), two coumarins
(19, 20), a squalene derivative (21), a triterpenoid (22), and six phenolic
compounds (23-28) from the extract of E. longifolia. Evaluation of the biological
activity revealed that C19-type and C20-type quassinoids, β-carboline, and
canthin-6-one alkaloids are potent NF-κB inhibitors, with IC50 values in the low 
micromolar range, while C18-type quassinoids, phenolic compounds, coumarins, the 
squalene derivative, and the triterpenoid turned out to be inactive when tested
at a concentration of 30 μM. Eurycomalactone (2), 14,15β-dihydroklaieanone (7),
and 13,21-dehydroeurycomanone (10) were identified as potent NF-κB inhibitors
with IC50 values of less than 1 μM.
