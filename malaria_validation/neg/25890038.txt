BACKGROUND: Vivax malaria was historically epidemic in Henan Province of China
and Anopheles sinensis was the main vectors and poor farming communities bare the
greatest burden of disease. Knockdown resistance in An. sinensis is one of the
mechanisms of resistance against pyrethroids. In the present study, the frequency
of mutations from An. sinensis was examined in Henan province, China.
METHODS: Anopheles was collected from Kaifeng, Tongbai, Tanghe, Pingqiao, Shihe, 
and Yongcheng counties of Henan province in 2013. Molecular identification of
Anopheles species was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the
internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Part of the IIS6 domain of the para-type
sodium channel protein gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and directly 
sequenced. Frequency and geographic difference of kdr gene mutant types were
analysed.
RESULTS: 208 Anopheles were received molecular identification, of which 169
(81.25%) were An. sinensis, 25 (12.02%) were Anopheles yatsushiroensis, and 12
(5.77%) were Anopheles lesteri. A 325 bp fragment of the para-type sodium channel
gene including position 1014 was successfully sequenced from 139 Anopheles, of
which 125 (89.93%) were An. sinensis, 12 (8.63%) were An. yatsushiroensis, 2
(1.44%) were An. lesteri. The molecular analyses revealed that mutations existed 
at codon 1014 in An. sinensis but not in An. yatsushiroensis and An. lesteri.
Frequency of kdr mutation was 73.60% (92/125) from population of An. sinensis in 
Henan province, of which L1014F (TTT + TTC) allele frequencies accounted for
46.40% (58/125), and was higher than that of L1014C(TGT) which accounted for
27.20% (34/125) ( χ2 = 55.423, P < 0.001). The frequency of kdr mutation in
Kaifeng county was 100% (49/49), and was higher than that of 37.93% (11/29) in
Tongbai, 54.55% (6/11) in Pingqiao, 50.00% (3/3) in Shihe, and 62.50% (10/16) in 
Yongcheng county, respectively (χ2 = 39.538, P < 0.001; χ2 = 24.298, P < 0.001;
χ2 = 25.913, P < 0.001; χ2 = 20.244, P < 0.001). While 92.86% (13/14) frequency
of kdr mutation was found in Tanghe county, which was higher than that in Tongbai
county (χ2 = 11.550, P = 0.0018).
CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of kdr gene mutations from population of An.
sinensis in Henan province was found.
