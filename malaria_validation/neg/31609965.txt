Determining the genetic basis of fitness is central to understanding evolution
and transmission of microbial pathogens. In human malaria parasites (Plasmodium
falciparum), most experimental work on fitness has focused on asexual blood stage
parasites, because this stage can be easily cultured, although the transmission
of malaria requires both female Anopheles mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. We
explore a powerful approach to identify the genetic determinants of parasite
fitness across both invertebrate and vertebrate life-cycle stages of P.
falciparum. This combines experimental genetic crosses using humanized mice, with
selective whole genome amplification and pooled sequencing to determine
genome-wide allele frequencies and identify genomic regions under selection
across multiple lifecycle stages. We applied this approach to genetic crosses
between artemisinin resistant (ART-R, kelch13-C580Y) and ART-sensitive (ART-S,
kelch13-WT) parasites, recently isolated from Southeast Asian patients. Two
striking results emerge: we observed (i) a strong genome-wide skew (>80%) towards
alleles from the ART-R parent in the mosquito stage, that dropped to ~50% in the 
blood stage as selfed ART-R parasites were selected against; and (ii) repeatable 
allele specific skews in blood stage parasites with particularly strong selection
(selection coefficient (s) ≤ 0.18/asexual cycle) against alleles from the ART-R
parent at loci on chromosome 12 containing MRP2 and chromosome 14 containing
ARPS10. This approach robustly identifies selected loci and has strong potential 
for identifying parasite genes that interact with the mosquito vector or
compensatory loci involved in drug resistance.
