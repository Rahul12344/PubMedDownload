The Duffy blood group is of major interest in clinical medicine as it plays an
important role in Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax infection. In the
present study, the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes and allelic
frequencies among P. knowlesi infected patients as well as healthy individuals in
Peninsular Malaysia were determined. The blood group of 60 healthy blood donors
and 51 P. knowlesi malaria patients were genotyped using allele specific
polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). The data was analyzed using Fisher's exact
test in order to assess the significance of the variables. Our results show a
high proportion of the FY*A/FY*A genotype (>85% for both groups) and a high
frequency of the FY*A allele (>90% for both groups). The FY*A/FY*A genotype was
the most predominant genotype in both infected and healthy blood samples. The
genotype frequency did not differ significantly between the donor blood and the
malaria patient groups. Also, there was no significant correlation between
susceptibility to P. knowlesi infection with any Duffy blood genotype.
