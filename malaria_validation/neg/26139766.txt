The sickle gene is widespread among many tribal population groups in India with
prevalence of heterozygotes varying from 1-40 per cent. Co-inheritance of the
sickle gene with β-thalassaemia, HbD Punjab and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency has also been reported. Most of the screening programmes in
India now use high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis although the
solubility test is also sensitive and cheap. Sickle cell disease (SCD) among
tribal populations is generally milder than among non-tribal groups with fewer
episodes of painful crises, infections, acute chest syndrome and need for
hospitalization. This has partly been attributed to the very high prevalence of
α-thalassaemia among these tribes as well as higher foetal haemoglobin levels.
However, the clinical presentation is variable with many cases having a severe
presentation. There is not much information available on maternal and perinatal
outcome in tribal women with sickle cell disease. Newborn screening programmes
for SCD have recently been initiated in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa and
Chattisgarh and monitoring these birth cohorts will help to understand the
natural history of SCD in India. Prenatal diagnosis is acceptable by tribal
families in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Rural 
Health Mission in different States are undertaking outreach programmes for better
management and control of the disease.
