China has set a goal to eliminate all malaria in the country by 2020, but it is
unclear if current understanding of malaria vectors and transmission is
sufficient to achieve this objective. Anopheles sinensis is the most widespread
malaria vector specie in China, which is also responsible for vivax malaria
outbreak in central China. We reviewed literature from 1954 to 2016 on An.
sinensis with emphasis on biology, bionomics, and molecular biology. A total of
538 references were relevant and included. An. sienesis occurs in 29 Chinese
provinces. Temperature can affect most life-history parameters. Most An. sinensis
are zoophilic, but sometimes they are facultatively anthropophilic. Sporozoite
analysis demonstrated An. sinensis efficacy on Plasmodium vivax transmission. An.
sinensis was not stringently refractory to P. falciparum under experimental
conditions, however, sporozoite was not found in salivary glands of field
collected An. sinensis. The literature on An. sienesis biology and bionomics was 
abundant, but molecular studies, such as gene functions and mechanisms, were
limited. Only 12 molecules (genes, proteins or enzymes) have been studied. In
addition, there were considerable untapped omics resources for potential vector
control tools. Existing information on An. sienesis could serve as a baseline for
advanced research on biology, bionomics and genetics relevant to vector control
strategies.
