Evasion of clinical interventions by Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs through
selection of non-susceptible genomic variants. We report whole-genome sequencing 
of 3,085 pneumococcal carriage isolates from a 2.4-km(2) refugee camp. This
sequencing provides unprecedented resolution of the process of recombination and 
its impact on population evolution. Genomic recombination hotspots show
remarkable consistency between lineages, indicating common selective pressures
acting at certain loci, particularly those associated with antibiotic resistance.
Temporal changes in antibiotic consumption are reflected in changes in
recombination trends, demonstrating rapid spread of resistance when selective
pressure is high. The highest frequencies of receipt and donation of recombined
DNA fragments were observed in non-encapsulated lineages, implying that this
largely overlooked pneumococcal group, which is beyond the reach of current
vaccines, may have a major role in genetic exchange and the adaptation of the
species as a whole. These findings advance understanding of pneumococcal
population dynamics and provide information for the design of future intervention
strategies.
