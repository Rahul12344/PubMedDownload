Aphelids are a poorly known group of parasitoids of algae that have raised
considerable interest due to their pivotal phylogenetic position. Together with
Cryptomycota and the highly derived Microsporidia, they have been recently
re-classified as the Opisthosporidia, which constitute the sister group to the
fungi within the Holomycota. Despite their huge diversity, as revealed by
molecular environmental studies, and their phylogenetic interest, only three
genera have been described (Aphelidium, Amoeboaphelidium, and Pseudaphelidium),
from which 18S rRNA gene sequences exist only for Amoeboaphelidium and Aphelidium
species. Here, we describe the life cycle and ultrastructure of a new
representative of Aphelida, Paraphelidium tribonemae gen. et sp. nov., and
provide the first 18S rRNA gene sequence obtained for this genus. Molecular
phylogenetic analysis indicates that Paraphelidium is distantly related to both
Aphelidium and Amoebaphelidium, highlighting the wide genetic diversity of
aphelids. Paraphelidium tribonemae has amoeboflagellate zoospores containing a
lipid-microbody complex, dictyosomes, and mitochondria with rhomboid cristae,
which are also present in trophonts and plasmodia. The amoeboid trophont uses
pseudopodia to feed from the host cytoplasm. Although genetically distinct, the
genus Paraphelidium is morphologically indistinguishable from other aphelid
genera and has zoospores able to produce lamellipodia with subfilopodia like
those of Amoeboaphelidium.
