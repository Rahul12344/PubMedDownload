The role of intra-host genetic diversity in dengue viral populations remains a
topic of debate, particularly the impact on transmission of changes in this
diversity. Several approaches have been taken to increasing and decreasing the
genetic diversity of populations of RNA viruses and have drawn what appear to be 
contradictory conclusions. A 2-6 fold increase in genetic diversity of a wild
type population of dengue virus serotype 1(DENV1) and of an infectious clone
population derived from the wild type population, produced by treatment with
nucleotide analogue 5 fluorouracil (5FU), drove the populations to extinction.
Removal of 5FU immediately prior to extinction, resulted in a return to
pre-treatment levels of fitness and genetic diversity, albeit with novel single
nucleotide polymorphisms. These observations support the concept that DENV
populations exist on fitness peaks determined by their transmission requirements 
and either an increase or a decrease in genetic diversity may result in a loss of
fitness.
