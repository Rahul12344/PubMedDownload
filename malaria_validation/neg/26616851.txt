Artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria is an increasing problem in Southeast
Asia, but has not been associated with increased transmission of the disease,
yet. During a recent outbreak in 2014 in Ubon Ratchatani, Eastern Thailand,
parasites from 101 patients with falciparum malaria were genotyped for
antimalarial drug resistance markers. Mutations in the Kelch13 marker for
artemisinin resistance were present in 93% of samples, mainly C580Y from 2 major 
clusters as identified by microsatellite typing. Resistance markers for
antifolates and chloroquine were also highly prevalent. Most strains (91%)
carried single copy number PfMDR1, suggesting sustained sensitivity to
mefloquine, the partner drug in the local first-line artemisinin combination
therapy (ACT). The high prevalence of artemisinin resistance in this recent
malaria outbreak suggests but does not prove a causative role in increased
transmission. Careful monitoring of ACT efficacy and additional genetic
epidemiological studies are warranted to guide the public health response to the 
outbreak.
