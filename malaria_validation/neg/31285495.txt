The zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi parasite is the most common cause of human
malaria in Malaysia. Genetic analysis has shown that the parasites are divided
into three subpopulations according to their geographic origin (Peninsular or
Borneo) and, in Borneo, their macaque host (Macaca fascicularis or M.
nemestrina). Whilst evidence suggests that genetic exchange events have occurred 
between the two Borneo subpopulations, the picture is unclear in less studied
Peninsular strains. One difficulty is that P. knowlesi infected individuals tend 
to present with low parasitaemia leading to samples with insufficient DNA for
whole genome sequencing. Here, using a parasite selective whole genome
amplification approach on unprocessed blood samples, we were able to analyse
recent genomes sourced from both Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. The analysis
provides evidence that recombination events are present in the Peninsular
Malaysia parasite subpopulation, which have acquired fragments of the M.
nemestrina associated subpopulation genotype, including the DBPÎ² and NBPXa
erythrocyte invasion genes. The NBPXb invasion gene has also been exchanged
within the macaque host-associated subpopulations of Malaysian Borneo. Our work
provides strong evidence that exchange events are far more ubiquitous than
expected and should be taken into consideration when studying the highly complex 
P. knowlesi population structure.
