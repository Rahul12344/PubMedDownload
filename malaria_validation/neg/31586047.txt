Plasmodium species are frequently host-specific, but little is currently known
about the molecular factors restricting host switching. This is particularly
relevant for P. falciparum, the only known human-infective species of the
Laverania sub-genus, all other members of which infect African apes. Here we show
that all tested P. falciparum isolates contain an inactivating mutation in an
erythrocyte invasion associated gene, PfEBA165, the homologues of which are
intact in all ape-infective Laverania species. Recombinant EBA165 proteins only
bind ape, not human, erythrocytes, and this specificity is due to differences in 
erythrocyte surface sialic acids. Correction of PfEBA165 inactivating mutations
by genome editing yields viable parasites, but is associated with down regulation
of both PfEBA165 and an adjacent invasion ligand, which suggests that PfEBA165
expression is incompatible with parasite growth in human erythrocytes.
Pseudogenization of PfEBA165 may represent a key step in the emergence and
evolution of P. falciparum.
