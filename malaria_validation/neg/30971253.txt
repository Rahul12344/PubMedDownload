BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is the primary vector of vivax malaria in China
and its control is under great threat as the development of insecticide
resistance. In contrast to physiological resistance, there is no report of
behavioural modifications of resistant An. sinensis after long-term insecticide
use, despite their huge potential impact on malaria transmission.
METHODS: Larvae or pupae of An. sinensis were collected from Yuanyang, Bishan,
and Wuhe counties from southwestern to eastern China. Resistance to deltamethrin 
was assayed using the standard World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility
test. The frequency distribution of the kdr allele of the para-type sodium
channel gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 
DNA sequencing. Contact repellency to deltamethrin-impregnated bed nets was
evaluated using a modified WHO cone bioassay.
RESULTS: All contemporary field populations for all three geographic locations
were resistant to deltamethrin, with mortality ranging from 6.00 to 26.79%. Three
kdr genotypes with either an L1014F or L1014C substitution with frequencies of
76.10-100% were identified in the Bishan and Wuhe populations, but no kdr
mutations were detected in the Yuanyang samples despite high phenotypic
resistance. The susceptible mosquitoes exhibited significantly longer flying time
and more takeoffs on deltamethrin-treated bed nets (DTN) than on untreated bed
nets (UTN), suggestive of robust avoidance behaviour. However, no significant
increases in the frequency of takeoffs or flying time were observed in
deltamethrin-resistant An. sinensis populations when exposed on DTNs, regardless 
of the presence of a kdr mutation. Moreover, the first takeoff from DTNs by
resistant mosquitoes significantly lagged behind compared to susceptible
mosquitoes.
CONCLUSION: The An. sinensis populations were highly resistant to deltamethrin
and exhibited decreased avoidance behaviour. Behavioural modification
significantly associated with deltamethrin resistance, but not directly related
to the presence of kdr mutations, indicating that there are additional factors
contributing to the changes.
