Drug resistance of malaria parasites remains a problem affecting antimalarial
treatment and control of the disease. We previously synthesized an antimalarial
endoperoxide, N-89, having high antimalarial effects in vitro and in vivo. In
this study we seek to understand the resistant mechanism against N-89 by
establishing a highly N-89-resistant clone, named NRC10H, of the Plasmodium
falciparum FCR-3 strain. We describe gene mutations in the parent FCR-3 strain
and the NRC10H clone using whole-genome sequencing and subsequently by expression
profiling using quantitative real-time PCR. Seven genes related to drug
resistance, proteolysis, glycophosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, and
phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis exhibited a single amino acid substitution 
in the NRC10H clone. Among these seven genes, the multidrug resistance protein 2 
(mdr2) variant A532S was found only in NRC10H. The genetic status of the P.
falciparum endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium binding protein (PfERC), a
potential target of N-89, was similar between the NRC10H clone and the parent
FCR-3 strain. These findings suggest that the genetic alterations of the
identified seven genes, in particular mdr2, in NRC10H could give rise to
resistance of the antimalarial endoperoxide N-89.
