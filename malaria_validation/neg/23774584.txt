Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the best alternative for malaria diagnosis
where a microscopic examination cannot be performed. We report here the first
case of P. falciparum (false-negative) misdiagnosis in a soldier stationed in
Uganda, associated with a reduced number of repeats in the P. falciparum
histidine-rich protein 2 gene (pfhrp2). This gene was subsequently sequenced to
determine the reason for the discordance between the RDT results and the later
microscopic examination. Ten repeats of the type 2 motif AHHAHHAAD and four
repeats of the type 7 motif AHHAAD were found. This isolate belongs to the group 
of non-sensitive parasites (<43 repeats) that are not detected by HRP2 RDTs. This
inappropriate case management could have been fatal for the patient. This case
confirms the problem of negative RDT results in isolated situations and of basing
a therapeutic strategy on these negative results. Investigations should be
conducted in Uganda and other areas of Africa to determine the presence and the
geographical spread of parasites with pfhrp2 gene deletion to ensure the best
performance of RDTs.
