Underlying the development of malaria parasites within erythrocytes and the
resulting pathogenicity is a hardwired program that secures proper timing of gene
transcription and production of functionally relevant proteins. How
stage-specific gene expression is orchestrated in vivo remains unclear. Here,
using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), we
identified ∼4,000 regulatory regions in P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages.
The vast majority of these sites are located within 2 kb upstream of transcribed 
genes and their chromatin accessibility pattern correlates positively
with abundance of the respective mRNA transcript. Importantly, these regions are 
sufficient to drive stage-specific reporter gene expression and DNA motifs
enriched in stage-specific sets of regulatory regions interact with members of
the P. falciparum AP2 transcription factor family. Collectively, this study
provides initial insights into the in vivo gene regulatory network of
P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages and should serve as a valuable resource
for future studies.
