BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation are poorly
understood in Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, most of the genes in Plasmodium
falciparum are transcriptionally poised and only a handful of cis-regulatory
elements are known to operate in transcriptional regulation. Here, we employed an
epigenetic signature based approach to identify significance of previously
uncharacterised intergenic regions enriched with histone modification marks
leading to discovery of enhancer-like elements.
RESULTS: We found that enhancer-like elements are significantly enriched with
H3K4me1, generate unique non-coding bi-directional RNAs and majority of them can 
function as cis-regulators. Furthermore, functional enhancer reporter assay
demonstrates that the enhancer-like elements regulate transcription of target
genes in Plasmodium falciparum. Our study also suggests that the Plasmodium
genome segregates functionally related genes into discrete housekeeping and
pathogenicity/virulence clusters, presumably for robust transcriptional control
of virulence/pathogenicity genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This report contributes to the understanding of parasite regulatory 
genomics by identification of enhancer-like elements, defining their epigenetic
and transcriptional features and provides a resource of functional cis-regulatory
elements that may give insights into the virulence/pathogenicity of Plasmodium
falciparum.
