Malaria is a tropical human disease, caused by protozoan parasites, wherein a
significant number of the world's population is at risk. Annually, more than 219 
million new cases are reported. Although there are prevention treatments, there
are no highly and widely effective licensed anti-malarial vaccines available for 
use. Opportunities for utilization of plant-based vaccines as novel platforms for
developing safe, reliable, and affordable treatments offer promise for developing
such a vaccine against malaria. In this study, a Malchloroplast candidate vaccine
was designed, composed of segments of AMA1 and MSP1 proteins, two epitopes of
Plasmodium falciparum, along with a GK1 peptide from Taenia solium as adjuvant,
and this was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts. Transplastomic tobacco lines were
generated using biolistic transformation, and these were confirmed to carry the
synthetic gene construct. Expression of the synthetic GK1 peptide was confirmed
using RT-PCR and Western blots. Furthermore, the GK1 peptide was detected by HPLC
at levels of up to 6 µg g-1 dry weight of tobacco leaf tissue. The plant-derived 
Malchloroplast candidate vaccine was subsequently tested in BALB/c female mice
following subcutaneous administration, and was found to elicit specific humoral
responses. Furthermore, components of this candidate vaccine were recognized by
antibodies in Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients and were immunogenic in test
mice. Thus, this study provided a 'proof of concept' for a promising plant-based 
candidate subunit vaccine against malaria.
