BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Brazil is responsible for a large number of Plasmodium 
vivax cases in America. Given the emergence of P. vivax parasites resistant to
chloroquine and the effectiveness of antifolates in vivax malaria treatment
together with a correlation between mutations in P. vivax dhfr and dhps genes and
SP treatment failure, the point mutations in these genes were investigated.
METHODS: Blood samples from 54 patients experiencing vivax malaria symptomatic
episodes in the Amazonian Region were investigated. Genomic DNA was extracted
using a DNA extraction kit (QIAGENTM). Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification was carried out followed by Sanger sequencing to detect single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
FINDINGS: All tested isolates showed non-synonymous mutations in pvdhfr gene:
117N (54/54, 100%) and 58R (25/54, 46%). Double mutant allele 58R/117N (FRTNI,
28%) was the most frequent followed by triple mutant alleles (58R/117N/173L,
FRTNL, 11%; 58R/61M/117N, FRMNI, 5% 117N/173L, FSTNL, 4%) and quadruple mutant
allele (58R/61M/117N/173L, FRMNL, 2%). A single mutation was observed at codon
C383G in pvdhps gene (SGKAV, 48%).
CONCLUSION: No evidence of molecular signatures associated with P. vivax
resistance to SP was observed in the Brazilian samples.
