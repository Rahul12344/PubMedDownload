Several species of Plasmodium are responsible for causing malaria in humans.
Proper diagnoses are crucial to case management, because severity and treatment
varies between species. Diagnoses can be made using rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs), which detect Plasmodium proteins. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most
virulent cases of malaria, and P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) is
a common target of falciparum malaria RDTs. Here we report a case in which a
falciparum malaria patient in Bangladesh tested negative on PfHRP2-based RDTs.
The negative results can be attributed to a deletion of part of the pfhrp2 gene
and frameshift mutations in both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene. This finding may have
implications for malaria diagnostics and case management in Bangladesh and other 
regions of South Asia.
