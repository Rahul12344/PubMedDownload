Malaria has had the largest impact of any infectious disease on shaping the human
genome, exerting enormous selective pressure on genes that improve survival in
severe malaria infections. Modern humans originated in Africa and lost skin
melanization as they migrated to temperate regions of the globe. Although it is
well documented that loss of melanization improved cutaneous Vitamin D synthesis,
melanin plays an evolutionary ancient role in insect immunity to malaria and in
some instances melanin has been implicated to play an immunoregulatory role in
vertebrates. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that melanization may be protective
in malaria infections using mouse models. Congenic C57BL/6 mice that differed
only in the gene encoding tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin,
showed no difference in the clinical course of infection by Plasmodium yoelii
17XL, that causes severe anemia, Plasmodium berghei ANKA, that causes severe
cerebral malaria or Plasmodium chabaudi AS that causes uncomplicated chronic
disease. Moreover, neither genetic deficiencies in vitamin D synthesis nor
vitamin D supplementation had an effect on survival in cerebral malaria. Taken
together, these results indicate that neither melanin nor vitamin D production
improve survival in severe malaria.
