We have analyzed the in vitro activities of pyronaridine and methylene blue
against 59 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Kenya in association with
polymorphisms in Pfcrt (codon 76), Pfmdr1 (codon 86), and Pfnhe (full sequence). 
The median inhibitory concentrations that kill 50% of parasites were 13.5 and 3.3
nM for pyronaridine and methylene blue, respectively. Their activities were not
associated with polymorphisms in these genes. The drugs' high in vitro activities
indicate that they would be efficacious against Kenyan isolates in vivo.
