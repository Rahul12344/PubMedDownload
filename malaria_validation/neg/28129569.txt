In the past decade there has been a significant reduction in deaths due to
malaria, in part due to the success of the gold standard antimalarial treatment -
artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). However the potential threat of ACT
failure and the lack of a broadly effective malaria vaccine are driving efforts
to discover new chemical entities (NCEs) to target this disease. The primary
sulfonamide (PS) moiety is a component of several clinical drugs, including those
for treatment of kidney disease, glaucoma and epilepsy, however this chemotype
has not yet been exploited for malaria. In this study 31 PS compounds sourced
from the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Tres Cantos antimalarial set (TCAMS) were
investigated for their ability to selectively inhibit the in vitro growth of
Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage malaria parasites. Of these, 14 compounds
were found to have submicromolar activity (IC50 0.16-0.89 μM) and a modest
selectivity index (SI) for the parasite versus human cells (SI > 12 to >43). As
the PS moiety is known to inhibit carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes from many
organisms, the PS compounds were assessed for recombinant P. falciparum CA (PfCA)
mediated inhibition of CO2 hydration. The PfCA inhibition activity did not
correlate with antiplasmodial potency. Furthermore, no significant difference in 
IC50 was observed for P. falciparum versus P. knowlesi (P > 0.05), a Plasmodium
species that is not known to contain an annotated PfCA gene. Together these data 
suggest that the asexual intraerythrocytic stage antiplasmodial activity of the
PS compounds examined in this study is likely unrelated to PfCA inhibition.
