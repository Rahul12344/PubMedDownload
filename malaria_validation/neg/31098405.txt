PfEMP1 (erythrocyte membrane protein 1) adhesins play a pivotal role in the
pathophysiology of falciparum malaria, by mediating sequestration of Plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature. PfEMP1 variants are
expressed by var genes and are presented on membrane elevations, termed knobs.
However, the organization of PfEMP1 on knobs is largely unclear. Here, we use
super-resolution microscopy and genetically altered parasites expressing a
modified var2csa gene in which the coding sequence of the photoactivatable mEOS2 
was inserted to determine the number and distribution of PfEMP1 on single knobs. 
The data were verified by quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis and immuno-electron microscopy together with stereology methods. We show
that knobs contain 3.3 ± 1.7 and 4.3 ± 2.5 PfEMP1 molecules, predominantly placed
on the knob tip, in parasitized erythrocytes containing wild type and sickle
haemoglobin, respectively. The ramifications of our findings for cytoadhesion and
immune evasion are discussed.
