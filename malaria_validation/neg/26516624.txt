The use of biomedical SNP markers of diseases can improve effectiveness of
treatment. Genotyping of patients with subsequent searching for SNPs more
frequent than in norm is the only commonly accepted method for identification of 
SNP markers within the framework of translational research. The bioinformatics
applications aimed at millions of unannotated SNPs of the "1000 Genomes" can make
this search for SNP markers more focused and less expensive. We used our Web
service involving Fisher's Z-score for candidate SNP markers to find a
significant change in a gene's expression. Here we analyzed the change caused by 
SNPs in the gene's promoter via a change in affinity of the TATA-binding protein 
for this promoter. We provide examples and discuss how to use this bioinformatics
application in the course of practical analysis of unannotated SNPs from the
"1000 Genomes" project. Using known biomedical SNP markers, we identified 17
novel candidate SNP markers nearby: rs549858786 (rheumatoid arthritis);
rs72661131 (cardiovascular events in rheumatoid arthritis); rs562962093 (stroke);
rs563558831 (cyclophosphamide bioactivation); rs55878706 (malaria resistance,
leukopenia), rs572527200 (asthma, systemic sclerosis, and psoriasis), rs371045754
(hemophilia B), rs587745372 (cardiovascular events); rs372329931, rs200209906,
rs367732974, and rs549591993 (all four: cancer); rs17231520 and rs569033466
(both: atherosclerosis); rs63750953, rs281864525, and rs34166473 (all three:
malaria resistance, thalassemia).
