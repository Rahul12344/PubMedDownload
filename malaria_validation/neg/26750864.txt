Insecticide resistance is a major obstacle to control of Anopheles malaria
mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa and requires an improved understanding of the
underlying mechanisms. Efforts to discover resistance genes and DNA markers have 
been dominated by candidate gene and quantitative trait locus studies of
laboratory strains, but with greater availability of genome sequences a shift
toward field-based agnostic discovery is anticipated. Mechanisms evolve
continually to produce elevated resistance yielding multiplicative diagnostic
markers, co-screening of which can give high predictive value. With a shift
toward prospective analyses, identification and screening of resistance marker
panels will boost monitoring and programmatic decision making.
