Insecticide resistance genes are often associated with pleiotropic effects on
various mosquito life-history traits. However, very little information is
available on the impact of insecticide resistance on blood feeding process in
mosquitoes. Here, using two recently detected DNA-based metabolic markers in the 
major malaria vector, An. funestus, we investigated how metabolic resistance
genes could affect the blood meal intake. After allowing both the field F1 and
lab F8 Anopheles funestus strains to feed on the human arm for 30 minutes, we
assessed the association between key parameters of blood meal process including, 
probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success, blood meal size, and
markers of glutathione S-transferase (L119F-GSTe2) and cytochrome P450
(CYP6P9a_R)-mediated metabolic resistance. None of the parameters of blood meal
process was associated with L119F-GSTe2 genotypes. By contrast, for CYP6P9a_R,
homozygous resistant mosquitoes were significantly more able to blood-feed than
homozygous susceptible (OR = 3.3; CI 95%: 1.4-7.7; P = 0.01) mosquitoes.
Moreover, the volume of blood meal ingested by CYP6P9a-SS mosquitoes was lower
than that of CYP6P9a-RS (P<0.004) and of CYP6P9a-RR (P<0.006). This suggests that
CYP6P9a gene is inked with the feeding success and blood meal size of An.
funestus. However, no correlation was found in the expression of CYP6P9a and that
of genes encoding for salivary proteins involved in blood meal process. This
study suggests that P450-based metabolic resistance may influence the blood
feeding process of Anopheles funestus mosquito and consequently its ability to
transmit malaria parasites.
