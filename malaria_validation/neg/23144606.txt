The transcriptome in a cell is finely regulated by a large number of molecular
mechanisms able to control the balance between mRNA production and degradation.
Recent experimental findings have evidenced that fine and specific regulation of 
degradation is needed for proper orchestration of a global cell response to
environmental conditions. We developed a computational technique based on
stochastic modeling, to infer condition-specific individual mRNA half-lives
directly from gene expression time-courses. Predictions from our method were
validated by experimentally measured mRNA decay rates during the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Plasmodium falciparum. We then applied
our methodology to publicly available data on the reproductive and metabolic
cycle of budding yeast. Strikingly, our analysis revealed, in all cases, the
presence of periodic changes in decay rates of sequentially induced genes and
co-ordination strategies between transcription and degradation, thus suggesting a
general principle for the proper coordination of transcription and degradation
machinery in response to internal and/or external stimuli.
