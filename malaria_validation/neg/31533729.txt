BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest causative agent of malaria, has 
high prevalence in Nigeria. Drug resistance causing failure of previously
effective drugs has compromised anti-malarial treatment. On this basis, there is 
need for a proactive surveillance for resistance markers to the currently
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), for early detection of
resistance before it become widespread.
METHODS: This study assessed anti-malarial resistance genes polymorphism in
patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Lagos, Nigeria. Sanger and
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods were used to screen for mutations in
thirty-seven malaria positive blood samples targeting the P. falciparum
chloroquine-resistance transporter (Pfcrt), P. falciparum multidrug-resistance 1 
(Pfmdr1), and P. falciparum kelch 13 (Pfk13) genes, which have been previously
associated with anti-malarial resistance.
RESULTS: Expectedly, the NGS method was more proficient, detecting six Pfmdr1,
seven Pfcrt and three Pfk13 mutations in the studied clinical isolates from
Nigeria, a malaria endemic area. These mutations included rare Pfmdr1 mutations, 
N504K, N649D, F938Y and S967N, which were previously unreported. In addition,
there was moderate prevalence of the K76T mutation (34.6%) associated with
chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance, and high prevalence of the N86 wild type 
allele (92.3%) associated with lumefantrine resistance.
CONCLUSION: Widespread circulation of mutations associated with resistance to
current anti-malarial drugs could potentially limit effective malaria therapy in 
endemic populations.
