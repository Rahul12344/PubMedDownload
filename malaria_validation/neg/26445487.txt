BACKGROUND: Members of the Anopheles gambiae species complex are primary vectors 
of human malaria in Africa. It is known that a large haplotype shared between An.
gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii by introgression carries point mutations of the
voltage-gated sodium channel gene para, including the L1014F kdr mutation
associated with insensitivity to pyrethroid insecticides. Carriage of L1014F kdr 
is also correlated with higher susceptibility to infection with Plasmodium
falciparum. However, the genetic mechanism and causative gene(s) underlying the
parasite susceptibility phenotype are not known.
METHODS: Mosquitoes from the wild Burkina Faso population were challenged by
feeding on natural P. falciparum gametocytes. Oocyst infection phenotypes were
determined and were tested for association with SNP genotypes. Candidate genes in
the detected locus were prioritized and RNAi-mediated gene silencing was used to 
functionally test for gene effects on P. falciparum susceptibility.
RESULTS: A genetic locus, Pfin6, was identified that influences infection levels 
of P. falciparum in mosquitoes. The locus segregates as a ~3 Mb haplotype
carrying 65 predicted genes including the para gene. The haplotype carrying the
kdr allele of para is linked to increased parasite infection prevalence, but many
single nucleotide polymorphisms on the haplotype are also equally linked to the
infection phenotype. Candidate genes in the haplotype were prioritized and
functionally tested. Silencing of para did not influence P. falciparum infection,
while silencing of a predicted immune gene, serine protease ClipC9, allowed
development of significantly increased parasite numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation influencing Plasmodium infection in wild Anopheles
is linked to a natural ~3 megabase haplotype on chromosome 2L that carries the
kdr allele of the para gene. Evidence suggests that para gene function does not
directly influence parasite susceptibility, and the association of kdr with
infection may be due to tight linkage of kdr with other gene(s) on the haplotype.
Further work will be required to determine if ClipC9 influences the outcome of P.
falciparum infection in nature, as well as to confirm the absence of a direct
influence by para.
