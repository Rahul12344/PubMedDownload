Sexual differentiation of malaria parasites from the asexual blood stage into
gametocytes is an essential part of the life cycle, as gametocytes are the form
that is taken up by the mosquito host. Because of the essentiality of this
process for transmission to the mosquito, gametocytogenesis is an extremely
attractive target for therapeutic interventions. The subject of this review is
the considerable progress that has been made in recent years in elucidating the
molecular mechanisms governing this important differentiation process. In
particular, a number of critical transcription factors and epigenetic regulators 
have emerged as crucial elements in the regulation of commitment. The
identification of these factors has allowed us to understand better than ever
before the events occurring prior to and during commitment to sexual development 
and offers potential for new therapeutic interventions.
