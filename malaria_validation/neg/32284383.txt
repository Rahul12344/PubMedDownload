The rapid evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite to every single drug
developed against it calls for the urgent identification of new molecular
targets. Using a stain specific for the detection of intracellular amyloid
deposits in live cells, we have detected the presence of abundant protein
aggregates in Plasmodium falciparum blood stages and female gametes cultured in
vitro, in the blood stages of mice infected by Plasmodium yoelii, and in the
mosquito stages of the murine malaria species Plasmodium berghei Aggregated
proteins could not be detected in early rings, the parasite form that starts the 
intraerythrocytic cycle. A proteomics approach was used to pinpoint actual
aggregating polypeptides in functional P. falciparum blood stages, which resulted
in the identification of 369 proteins, with roles particularly enriched in
nuclear import-related processes. Five aggregation-prone short peptides selected 
from this protein pool exhibited different aggregation propensity according to
Thioflavin-T fluorescence measurements, and were observed to form amorphous
aggregates and amyloid fibrils in transmission electron microscope images. The
results presented suggest that generalized protein aggregation might have a
functional role in malaria parasites. Future antimalarial strategies based on the
upsetting of the pathogen's proteostasis and therefore affecting multiple gene
products could represent the entry to new therapeutic approaches.
