The malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01, based on immunogenic regions of the Plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), has partial efficacy against clinical 
malaria in African children. Understanding how sequence diversity in CSP T- and
B-cell epitopes relates to naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity may be
useful in efforts to improve the efficacy of CSP-based vaccines. However,
limitations in sequencing technology have precluded thorough evaluation of
diversity in the immunogenic regions of this protein. In this study, 454, a next 
generation sequencing technology, was evaluated as a method for assessing
diversity in these regions. Portions of the circumsporozoite gene (cs) were
sequenced both by 454 and Sanger sequencing from samples collected in a study in 
Bandiagara, Mali. 454 detected more single nucleotide polymorphisms and
haplotypes in the T-cell epitopes than Sanger sequencing, and it was better able 
to resolve genetic diversity in samples with multiple infections; however, it
failed to generate sequence for the B-cell epitopes.
