BACKGROUND: Plasmodium requires an obligatory life stage in its mosquito host.
The parasites encounter a number of insults while journeying through this host
and have developed mechanisms to avoid host defenses. Lysozymes are a family of
important antimicrobial immune effectors produced by mosquitoes in response to
microbial challenge.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A mosquito lysozyme was identified as a
protective agonist for Plasmodium. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that
Anopheles gambiae lysozyme c-1 binds to oocysts of Plasmodium berghei and
Plasmodium falciparum at 2 and 5 days after infection. Similar results were
observed with Anopheles stephensi and P. falciparum, suggesting wide occurrence
of this phenomenon across parasite and vector species. Lysozyme c-1 did not bind 
to cultured ookinetes nor did recombinant lysozyme c-1 affect ookinete viability.
dsRNA-mediated silencing of LYSC-1 in Anopheles gambiae significantly reduced the
intensity and the prevalence of Plasmodium berghei infection. We conclude that
this host antibacterial protein directly interacts with and facilitates
development of Plasmodium oocysts within the mosquito.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work identifies mosquito lysozyme c-1 as a
positive mediator of Plasmodium development as its reduction reduces parasite
load in the mosquito host. These findings improve our understanding of parasite
development and provide a novel target to interrupt parasite transmission to
human hosts.
