The development of malaria parasites throughout their various life cycle stages
is coordinated by changes in gene expression. We previously showed that the
three-dimensional organization of the Plasmodium falciparum genome is strongly
associated with gene expression during its replication cycle inside red blood
cells. Here, we analyze genome organization in the P. falciparum and P. vivax
transmission stages. Major changes occur in the localization and interactions of 
genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, host cell invasion, sexual
differentiation, and master regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we
observe reorganization of subtelomeric heterochromatin around genes involved in
host cell remodeling. Depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) resulted in 
loss of interactions between virulence genes, confirming that PfHP1 is essential 
for maintenance of the repressive center. Our results suggest that the
three-dimensional genome structure of human malaria parasites is strongly
connected with transcriptional activity of specific gene families throughout the 
life cycle.
