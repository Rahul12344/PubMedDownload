The discovery and understanding of antigenic proteins are essential for
development of a vaccine against malaria. In Plasmodium falciparum, Pf92 have
been characterized as a merozoite surface protein, and this protein is expressed 
at the late schizont stage, but no study of Pv92, the orthologue of Pf92 in P.
vivax, has been reported. Thus, the protein structure of Pv92 was analyzed, and
the gene sequence was aligned with that of other Plasmodium spp. using
bioinformatics tools. The recombinant Pv92 protein was expressed and purified
using bacterial expression system and used for immunization of mice to gain the
polyclonal antibody and for evaluation of antigenicity by protein array. Also,
the antibody against Pv92 was used for subcellular analysis by immunofluorescence
assay. The Pv92 protein has a signal peptide and a sexual stage s48/45 domain,
and the cysteine residues at the N-terminal of Pv92 were completely conserved.
The N-terminal of Pv92 was successfully expressed as soluble form using a
bacterial expression system. The antibody raised against Pv92 recognized the
parasites and completely merged with PvMSP1-19, indicating that Pv92 was
localized on the merozoite surface. Evaluation of the human humoral immune
response to Pv92 indicated moderate antigenicity, with 65% sensitivity and 95%
specificity by protein array. Taken together, the merozoite surface localization 
and antigenicity of Pv92 implicate that it might be involved in attachment and
invasion of a merozoite to a new host cell or immune evasion during invasion
process.
