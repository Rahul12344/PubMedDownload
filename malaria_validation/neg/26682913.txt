BACKGROUND: Identification of variation in Ace-1 copy number and G119S mutation
genotype from samples of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii across West
Africa are important diagnostics of carbamate and organophosphate resistance at
population and individual levels. The most widespread and economical method,
PCR-RFLP, suffers from an inability to discriminate true heterozygotes from
heterozygotes with duplication.
METHODS: In addition to PCR-RFLP, in this study three different molecular
techniques were applied on the same mosquito specimens: TaqMan qPCR, qRTPCR and
ddPCR. To group heterozygous individuals recorded from the PCR-RFLP analysis into
different assumptive genotypes K-means clustering was applied on the Z-scores of 
data obtained from both the TaqMan and ddPCR methods. The qRTPCR analysis was
used for absolute quantification of copy number variation.
RESULTS: The results indicate that most heterozygotes are duplicated and that
G119S mutation must now be regarded as a complex genotype ranging from primarily 
single-copy susceptible Glycine homozygotes to balanced and imbalanced
heterozygotes, and multiply-amplified resistant Serine allele homozygotes. Whilst
qRTPCR-based gene copy analysis suffers from some imprecision, it clearly
illustrates differences in copy number among genotype groups identified by TaqMan
or ddPCR. Based on TaqMan method properties, and by coupling TaqMan and ddPCR
methods simultaneously on the same type of mosquito specimens, it demonstrated
that the TaqMan genotype assays associated with the K-means clustering algorithm 
could provide a useful semi-quantitative estimate method to investigate the level
of allele-specific duplication in mosquito populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Ace-1 gene duplication is evidently far more complex in An. gambiae 
and An. coluzzii than the better-studied mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, which
consequently can no longer be considered an appropriate model for prediction of
phenotypic consequences. These require urgent further evaluation in Anopheles. To
maintain the sustained effectiveness carbamates and organophosphates as
alternative products to pyrethroids for malaria vector control, monitoring of
duplicated resistant alleles in natural populations is essential to guide the
rational use of these insecticides.
