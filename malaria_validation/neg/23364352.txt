Communication between cells ensures coordinated behavior. In prokaryotes, this
signaling is typically referred to as quorum sensing, whereas in eukaryotic
cells, communication occurs through hormones. In recent years, reports have shown
that small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), can be transmitted from one
species to another, inducing signal interference in distant species, even in a
cross-kingdom manner. This new mode of cross-species communication might mediate 
symbiotic and pathogenic relationships between various organisms (e.g.,
microorganisms and their hosts). Here, we discuss several recent studies
concerning miRNA-mediated cross-species gene regulation.
