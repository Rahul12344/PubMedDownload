Self-propagating gene drive technologies have a number of desirable
characteristics that warrant their development for the control of insect pest and
vector populations, such as the malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Theoretically
easy to deploy and self-sustaining, these tools may be used to generate
cost-effective interventions that benefit society without obvious bias related to
wealth, age or education. Their species-specific design offers the potential to
reduce environmental risks and aim to be compatible and complementary with other 
control strategies, potentially expediting the elimination and eradication of
malaria. A number of strategies have been proposed for gene-drive based control
of the malaria mosquito and recent demonstrations have shown proof-of-principle
in the laboratory. Though several technical, ethical and regulatory challenges
remain, none appear insurmountable if research continues in a step-wise and open 
manner.
