BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria resistant to chloroquine and
pyrimethamine originated in limited foci and migrated to Africa. It remains
unresolved whether P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine, which is conferred by
mutations in dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), evolved following a similar
pattern.
METHODS: The dhps locus of 893 P. falciparum isolates from 12 countries in Asia, 
the Pacific Islands, Africa, and South America was sequenced. Haplotypes of 6
microsatellite loci flanking the dhps locus were determined to define the genetic
relationships among sulfadoxine-resistant lineages.
RESULTS: Six distinct sulfadoxine-resistant lineages were identified. Highly
resistant lineages appear to have originated only in Southeast Asia and South
America. Two resistant lineages found throughout Southeast Asia have been
introduced to East Africa, where they appear to have spread.
CONCLUSIONS: The infrequent selection of parasites highly resistant to
sulfadoxine and the subsequent migration of resistant lineages from Asia to
Africa are similar to the patterns observed in chloroquine and pyrimethamine
resistance. These findings strongly suggest that the global migration of
resistant parasites has played a decisive role in the establishment of
drug-resistant P. falciparum parasites, and that similar patterns may be
anticipated for the spread of artemisinin resistance.
