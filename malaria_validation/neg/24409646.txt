The artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) of artemether and lumefantrine
(Co-artem) has recently replaced chloroquine and fansidar as the first line
treatment policy drug in Uganda. It is necessary to develop practical procedures 
to monitor the likely emergence and spread of artemisinin resistant P. falciparum
strains. We have analyzed the genotypes of PfATP6 in parasites from 300 stored
filter paper samples from malaria patients who were diagnosed and treated in the 
years 1999 to 2004 at three field sites in Uganda. This is a period just prior to
introduction of Co-artem. In order to develop a simple molecular procedure for
mutation detection, regions of PfATP6 encoding protein domains important in
artemisinin binding was amplified by nested PCR. Three DNA products, which
together contain most of the coding region of amino acids located within the
putative active site of pfATP6 were readily amplified. The amplified DNA was
digested by restriction enzymes and the fragments sized by agarose gel
electrophoresis. For the important codons 260, 263 and 769, methods using
engineered restriction sites were employed. We did not find mutations at codons
for the key residues Lys 260, Leu263, Gln266, Ser769 and Asn1039. Nucleotide
sequencing of pfATPase6 gene DNA from at least 15 clinical isolates confirmed the
above findings and suggested that mutations at these amino acid residues have not
emerged in our study sites.
