The Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte-binding protein (RBP) family was identified
based on the annotation of adhesive ligands in the P. vivax genome.
Reticulocyte-specific interactions with the PvRBPs (PvRBP1 and PvRBP2) were
previously reported. Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue
4 (PfRh4, a homologue of PvRBP1) was observed to possess erythrocyte-binding
activity via complement receptor 1 on the erythrocyte surface. However, the
reticulocyte-binding mechanisms of P. vivax are unclear because of the large
molecular mass of PvRBP1 (>326 kDa) and the difficulty associated with in vitro
cultivation. In the present study, 34 kDa of PvRBP1a (PlasmoDB ID: PVX_098585)
and 32 kDa of PvRBP1b (PVX_098582) were selected from a 30 kDa fragment of PfRh4 
for reticulocyte-specific binding activity analysis. Both PvRBP1a and PvRBP1b
were found to be localized at the microneme in the mature schizont-stage
parasites. Naturally acquired immune responses against PvRBP1a-34 and PvRBP1b-32 
were observed lower than PvDBP-RII. The reticulocyte-specific binding activities 
of PvRBP1a-34 and PvRBP1b-32 were significantly higher than normocyte binding
activity and were significantly reduced by chymotrypsin treatment. PvRBP1a and
1b, bind to reticulocytes and that this suggests that these ligands may have an
important role in P. vivax merozoite invasion.
