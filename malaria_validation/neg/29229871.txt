Malaria is a major public health concern in Northeast India with a preponderance 
of drug-resistant strains. Until recently the partner drug for artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT) was sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP). Antifolate drug
resistance has been associated with the mutations at dihydropteroate synthase
(dhps) and dihydrofolatereductase (dhfr) genes. This study investigated
antifolate drug resistance at the molecular level. A total of 249 fever cases
from Arunachal Pradesh, NE India, were screened for malaria, and of these, 75
were found to be positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Samples were sequenced and
analysed with the help of BioEdit and ClustalW. Three novel point mutations were 
found in the dhps gene with 10 haplotypes along with the already reported
mutations. A single haplotype having quadruple mutation was found in the dhfr
gene. The study reports higher degree of antifolate drug resistance as evidenced 
by the presence of multiple point mutations in dhps and dhfr genes. The findings 
of this study strongly discourage the use SP as a partner drug in ACT.
