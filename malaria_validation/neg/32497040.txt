Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors threatens to reverse recent gains in
malaria control. Deciphering patterns of gene flow and resistance evolution in
malaria vectors is crucial to improving control strategies and preventing malaria
resurgence. A genome-wide survey of Anopheles funestus genetic diversity
Africa-wide revealed evidences of a major division between southern Africa and
elsewhere, associated with different population histories. Three genomic regions 
exhibited strong signatures of selective sweeps, each spanning major resistance
loci (CYP6P9a/b, GSTe2 and CYP9K1). However, a sharp regional contrast was
observed between populations correlating with gene flow barriers. Signatures of
complex molecular evolution of resistance were detected with evidence of copy
number variation, transposon insertion and a gene conversion between CYP6P9a/b
paralog genes. Temporal analyses of samples before and after bed net scale up
suggest that these genomic changes are driven by this control intervention.
Multiple independent selective sweeps at the same locus in different parts of
Africa suggests that local evolution of resistance in malaria vectors may be a
greater threat than trans-regional spread of resistance haplotypes.
