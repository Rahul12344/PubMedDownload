Recent data have found that Plasmodium ovale can be separated in two distinct
species: classic and variant P. ovale based on multilocus typing of different
genes. This study presents a P. ovale isolate from a patient infected in Ghana
together with an analysis of the small subunit RNA, cytochrome b, cytochrome c
oxidase I, cysteine protease and lactate dehydrogenase genes, which show that the
sample is a variant P. ovale and identical or highly similar to variant P. ovale 
isolated from humans in South-East Asia and Africa, and from a chimpanzee in
Cameroon. The split between the variant and classic P. ovale is estimated to have
occurred 1.7 million years ago.
