BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Northeast (NE) India is one of the high endemic regions 
for malaria with a preponderance of Plasmodium falciparum, resulting in high
morbidity and mortality. The P. falciparum parasite of this region showed high
polymorphism in drug-resistant molecular biomarkers. However, there is a paucity 
of information related to merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) and glutamate-rich 
protein (glurp) which have been extensively studied in various parts of the
world. The present study was, therefore, aimed at investigating the genetic
diversity of P. falciparum based on msp-1 and glurp in Arunachal Pradesh, a State
in NE India.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty nine patients with fever were screened for
malaria, of whom 75 were positive for P. falciparum. Blood samples were collected
from each microscopically confirmed patient. The DNA was extracted; nested
polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were performed to study the genetic
diversity of msp-1 (block 2) and glurp.
RESULTS: The block 2 of msp-1 gene was found to be highly polymorphic, and
overall allelic distribution showed that RO33 was the dominant allele (63%),
followed by MAD20 (29%) and K1 (8%) alleles. However, an extensive diversity (9
alleles and 4 genotypes) and 6-10 repeat regions exclusively of R2 type were
observed in glurp.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The P. falciparum population of NE India was
diverse which might be responsible for higher plasticity leading to the survival 
of the parasite and in turn to the higher endemicity of falciparum malaria of
this region.
