The HLA-G molecule plays an important role in immunomodulation. In a previous
study carried out on a southern French population our team showed that HLA-G
haplotypes, defined by SNPs in the coding region and specific SNPs located in
5'URR and 3'UTR regulatory regions, are associated with differential soluble
HLA-G expression (sHLA-G). Furthermore, the structure of these HLA-G haplotypes
appears to be conserved in geographically distant populations. The aim of our
study is to confirm these expectations in a sub-Saharan African population and to
explore additional factors, such as HLA-A alleles, that might influence sHLA-G
expression. DNA and plasma samples were collected from 229 Malians; HLA-G and
HLA-A genotyping were respectively performed by the Snap Shot® method and by
Luminex™ technology. sHLA-G dosage was performed using an ELISA kit. HLA-G and
HLA-A allelic and haplotypic frequencies were estimated using an EM algorithm
from the Gene[Rate] program. Associations between genetic and non genetic
parameters with sHLA-G were performed using a non-parametric test with GRAPH PAD 
Prism 5. Our results reveal a good conservation of the HLA-G UTR haplotype
structure in populations with different origins and demographic histories. These 
UTR haplotypes appear to be involved in different sHLA-G expression patterns.
Specifically, the UTR-2 haplotype was associated with low sHLA-G levels,
displaying a dominant negative effect. Furthermore, an allelic effect of both
HLA-G and HLA-A, as well as non genetic parameters, such as age and gender
possibly linked to osteogenesis and sexual hormones, also seem to be involved in 
the modulation of sHLA-G. These data suggest that further investigation in larger
cohorts and in populations from various ethnical backgrounds is necessary not
only to detect new functional polymorphism in HLA-G regulatory regions, but also 
to reveal the extent of biological phenomena that influence sHLA-G secretion and 
this might therefore have an impact on transplantation practice.
