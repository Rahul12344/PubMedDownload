The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports several hundred proteins into 
the infected erythrocyte that are involved in cellular remodeling and severe
virulence. The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL),
which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV). The PMV
gene is refractory to deletion, suggesting it is essential, but definitive proof 
is lacking. Here, we generated a PEXEL-mimetic inhibitor that potently blocks the
activity of PMV isolated from P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Assessment of
PMV activity in P. falciparum revealed PEXEL cleavage occurs cotranslationaly,
similar to signal peptidase. Treatment of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes
with the inhibitor caused dose-dependent inhibition of PEXEL processing as well
as protein export, including impaired display of the major virulence adhesin,
PfEMP1, on the erythrocyte surface, and cytoadherence. The inhibitor killed
parasites at the trophozoite stage and knockdown of PMV enhanced sensitivity to
the inhibitor, while overexpression of PMV increased resistance. This provides
the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in
Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV
as an antimalarial drug target.
