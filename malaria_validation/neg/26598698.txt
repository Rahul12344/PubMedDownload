Genetic engineering technologies can be used both to create transgenic mosquitoes
carrying antipathogen effector genes targeting human malaria parasites and to
generate gene-drive systems capable of introgressing the genes throughout wild
vector populations. We developed a highly effective autonomous Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9
(Cas9)-mediated gene-drive system in the Asian malaria vector Anopheles
stephensi, adapted from the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR). This specific system 
results in progeny of males and females derived from transgenic males exhibiting 
a high frequency of germ-line gene conversion consistent with homology-directed
repair (HDR). This system copies an ∼ 17-kb construct from its site of insertion 
to its homologous chromosome in a faithful, site-specific manner. Dual
anti-Plasmodium falciparum effector genes, a marker gene, and the autonomous
gene-drive components are introgressed into ∼ 99.5% of the progeny following
outcrosses of transgenic lines to wild-type mosquitoes. The effector genes remain
transcriptionally inducible upon blood feeding. In contrast to the efficient
conversion in individuals expressing Cas9 only in the germ line, males and
females derived from transgenic females, which are expected to have drive
component molecules in the egg, produce progeny with a high frequency of
mutations in the targeted genome sequence, resulting in near-Mendelian
inheritance ratios of the transgene. Such mutant alleles result presumably from
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) events before the segregation of somatic and
germ-line lineages early in development. These data support the design of this
system to be active strictly within the germ line. Strains based on this
technology could sustain control and elimination as part of the malaria
eradication agenda.
