INTRODUCTION: The present study was designed to investigate the association
between rs8177374 polymorphism and malaria symptoms due to exposure of Plasmodium
vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 454 samples were included in the study (228
malaria patients and 226 healthy individuals). Malaria patients, divided into P. 
vivax and P. falciparum groups on the basis of the causative species of
Plasmodium, were categorized into mild and severe on the basis of clinical
outcomes according to WHO criteria. Healthy individuals were used as controls.
Allele specific PCR based strategy was used for the identification of rs8177374
SNP.
RESULTS: MyD88-adaptor-like gene polymorphism was associated with susceptibility 
to malaria (p<0.001). C allele frequency (0.74) was higher in the population
compared to T allele frequency (0.26). CT genotype increased the susceptibility
of malaria (OR: 2.661; 95% CI: 1.722-4.113) and was positively associated with
mild malaria (OR: 5.609; 95% CI: 3.479-9.044, p=0.00). On the other hand, CC
genotype was associated with severe malaria (OR: 3.116; 95% CI: 1.560-6.224,
p=0.00). P. vivax infection rate was higher in CT genotype carriers compared to
other genotypes (OR: 3.616; 95% CI: 2.219-5.894, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: MyD88-adaptor-like/TIR domain containing adaptor protein polymorphism
for single nucleotide polymorphism rs8177374 is related with the susceptibility
of malaria.
