Haemosporida parasites of even-toed ungulates are diverse and globally
distributed, but since their discovery in 1913 their characterization has relied 
exclusively on microscopy-based descriptions. In order to bring molecular
approaches to bear on the identity and evolutionary relationships of ungulate
malaria parasites, we conducted Plasmodium cytb-specific nested PCR surveys using
blood from water buffalo in Vietnam and Thailand, and goats in Zambia. We found
that Plasmodium is readily detectable from water buffalo in these countries,
indicating that buffalo Plasmodium is distributed in a wider region than India,
which is the only area in which buffalo Plasmodium has been reported. Two types
(I and II) of Plasmodium sequences were identified from water buffalo and a third
type (III) was isolated from goat. Morphology of the parasite was confirmed in
Giemsa-reagent stained blood smears for the Type I sample. Complete mitochondrial
DNA sequences were isolated and used to infer a phylogeny in which ungulate
malaria parasites form a monophyletic clade within the Haemosporida, and branch
prior to the clade containing bird, lizard and other mammalian Plasmodium. Thus
it is likely that host switching of Plasmodium from birds to mammals occurred
multiple times, with a switch to ungulates independently from other mammalian
Plasmodium.
