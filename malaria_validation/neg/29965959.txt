The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has evolved an unusual genome
structure. The majority of the genome is relatively stable, with mutation rates
similar to most eukaryotic species. However, some regions are very unstable with 
high recombination rates, driving the generation of new immune evasion-associated
var genes. The molecular factors controlling the inconsistent stability of this
genome are not known. Here we studied the roles of the two putative RecQ
helicases in P. falciparum, PfBLM and PfWRN. When PfWRN was knocked down,
recombination rates increased four-fold, generating chromosomal abnormalities, a 
high rate of chimeric var genes and many microindels, particularly in known
'fragile sites'. This is the first identification of a gene involved in
suppressing recombination and maintaining genome stability in Plasmodium. By
contrast, no change in mutation rate appeared when the second RecQ helicase,
PfBLM, was mutated. At the transcriptional level, however, both helicases
evidently modulate the transcription of large cohorts of genes, with several
hundred genes-including a large proportion of vars-showing deregulated expression
in each RecQ mutant. Aberrant processing of stalled replication forks is a
possible mechanism underlying elevated mutation rates and this was assessed by
measuring DNA replication dynamics in the RecQ mutant lines. Replication forks
moved slowly and stalled at elevated rates in both mutants, confirming that RecQ 
helicases are required for efficient DNA replication. Overall, this work
identifies the Plasmodium RecQ helicases as major players in DNA replication,
antigenic diversification and genome stability in the most lethal human malaria
parasite, with important implications for genome evolution in this pathogen.
