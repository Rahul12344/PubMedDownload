BACKGROUND: HIV-1 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria cause substantial morbidity
in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as co-infecting pathogens. We examined the
relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical
malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on
P. falciparum PCR positivity.
METHODS: ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based regimens and one PI-based
anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy na√Øve participants. We
performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P. falciparum 18s rRNA gene to
detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 participants enrolled in
Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the closest sample preceding the
first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with clinical malaria and randomly
selected follow up samples from 88 persons without clinical malaria.
RESULTS: PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline samples and was not
significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell count, baseline
HIV-1 RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks. Neither baseline 
PCR positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of antiretroviral
therapy (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent clinical malaria.
Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not significantly
associated with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria (p = 0.609). 
Clinical malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 0.006) and a 
lower BMI (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: P. falciparum DNA was detected in 8% of participants at baseline, but
was not significantly associated with subsequent development of clinical malaria.
HIV PI therapy did not decrease the prevalence of PCR positivity or incidence of 
clinical disease.
