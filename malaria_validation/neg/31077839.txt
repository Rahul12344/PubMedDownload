The Plasmodium vivax Ookinete Surface Protein (Pvs25) is one of the leading
malaria Transmission-Blocking Vaccine candidates based on its high immunogenicity
in animal models, transmission-blocking activity of antibodies elicited in
clinical trials and high conservation among P. vivax isolates from endemic areas.
However, the polymorphism in gene encoding Pvs25 in endemic areas from South
America has been poorly studied so far. Here, we investigated the genetic
polymorphism of pvs25 in P. vivax isolates from five different regions of the
Brazilian Amazon (Cruzeiro do Sul, Mâncio Lima, Guajará, Manaus and Oiapoque) and
its impact on antigenicity of predicted B-cell epitopes using gene sequencing and
epitope prediction tools. Firstly, only a non-synonymous substitution was found
in the 657 bp amplified fragment in all sequenced samples, which represented an
exchange of Gln by Lys at position 87 (Q87K) of protein amino acid sequence
(domain II EGF-like). Q87K substitution was also present in all studied sites
with a total frequency of 37.8%. Cruzeiro do Sul presented Q87K substitution in
almost half of the isolates (48.4%), and an expressive frequency (40.5%) was also
found in Manaus, while in Mâncio Lima, Guajará and Oiapoque, the frequencies were
low (23.5%, 25% and 22.2% respectively). We also observed the Q87K mutation in a 
predicted B-cell epitope of pvs25, with no significant changes on its putative
antigenicity. Our data suggest that the pvs25 gene is conserved among isolates
from different Brazilian Amazon geographic regions, an important observation
considering the antigen potentiality as a vaccine candidate to cover distinct
P. vivax endemic areas worldwide.
