The quest for new antimalarial drugs, especially those with novel modes of
action, is essential in the face of emerging drug-resistant parasites. Here we
describe a new chemical class of molecules, pyrazoleamides, with potent activity 
against human malaria parasites and showing remarkably rapid parasite clearance
in an in vivo model. Investigations involving pyrazoleamide-resistant parasites, 
whole-genome sequencing and gene transfers reveal that mutations in two proteins,
a calcium-dependent protein kinase (PfCDPK5) and a P-type cation-ATPase (PfATP4),
are necessary to impart full resistance to these compounds. A pyrazoleamide
compound causes a rapid disruption of Na(+) regulation in blood-stage Plasmodium 
falciparum parasites. Similar effect on Na(+) homeostasis was recently reported
for spiroindolones, which are antimalarials of a chemical class quite distinct
from pyrazoleamides. Our results reveal that disruption of Na(+) homeostasis in
malaria parasites is a promising mode of antimalarial action mediated by at least
two distinct chemical classes.
