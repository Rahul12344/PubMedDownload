BACKGROUND: Molecular tools for detecting malaria-infected mosquitoes with
improved practicality, sensitivity and specificity, and high-throughput are
required. A common PCR technique used to detect mosquitoes infected with
Plasmodium spp. is a nested PCR assay based on the 18s-rRNA gene. However, this
technique has several technical limitations, is laborious and time consuming.
METHODS: In this study, a PCR-based on the Plasmodium cytochrome oxidase I
(COX-I) gene was compared with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR using serial dilutions
(330-0.0012 pg) of DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and
Plasmodium knowlesi and with DNA from 48 positive and negative Kenyan mosquitoes 
(previously detected by using both ELISA and PCR). This assay for Plasmodium spp.
DNA detection using the fast COX-I PCR assay was then performed individually on
2122 field collected mosquitoes (from the Solomon Islands) in which DNA was
extracted from head and thorax.
RESULTS: The fast COX-I PCR assay took 1 h to run and consistently detected as
low as to 0.043 pg of parasite DNA (equivalent to two parasites) in a single PCR,
while analyses with the 18s-rRNA nested PCR required 4 h to complete with a
consistent detection threshold of 1.5 pg of DNA. Both assays produced concordant 
results when applied to the 48 Kenyan control samples with known Plasmodium spp. 
infection status. The fast COX-I PCR identified 23/2122 Plasmodium-infected
mosquitoes from the Solomon Islands.
CONCLUSIONS: This new COX-I PCR adapted for a single PCR reaction is a faster,
simpler, cheaper, more sensitive technique amenable to high-throughput analyses
for Plasmodium DNA detection in mosquitoes and is comparable to the 18s-rRNA
nested PCR. The improved sensitivity seen with the fast COX-I PCR will improve
the accuracy of mosquito infection rate determination.
