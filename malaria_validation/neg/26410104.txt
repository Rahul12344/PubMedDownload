In this study, we developed human immune system (HIS) mice that possess
functional human CD4+ T cells and B cells, named HIS-CD4/B mice. HIS-CD4/B mice
were generated by first introducing HLA class II genes, including DR1 and DR4,
along with genes encoding various human cytokines and human B cell activation
factor (BAFF) to NSG mice by adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors,
followed by engrafting human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HIS-CD4/B mice, in 
which the reconstitution of human CD4+ T and B cells resembles to that of humans,
produced a significant level of human IgG against Plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite (PfCS) protein upon immunization. CD4+ T cells in HIS-CD4/B
mice, which possess central and effector memory phenotypes like those in humans, 
are functional, since PfCS protein-specific human CD4+ T cells secreting IFN-γ
and IL-2 were detected in immunized HIS-CD4/B mice. Lastly, PfCS
protein-immunized HIS-CD4/B mice were protected from in vivo challenge with
transgenic P. berghei sporozoites expressing the PfCS protein. The immune sera
collected from protected HIS-CD4/B mice reacted against transgenic P. berghei
sporozoites expressing the PfCS protein and also inhibited the parasite invasion 
into hepatocytes in vitro. Taken together, these studies show that our HIS-CD4/B 
mice could mount protective human anti-malaria immunity, consisting of human IgG 
and human CD4+ T cell responses both specific for a human malaria antigen.
