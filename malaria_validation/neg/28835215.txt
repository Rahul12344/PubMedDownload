BACKGROUND: The PfEMP1 family of Plasmodium falciparum antigens play a key role
in pathogenesis of severe malaria through their insertion into the surface of
parasite infected erythrocytes, and adhesion to host cells. Previous studies have
suggested that parasites expressing PfEMP1 subclasses group A and DC8, associated
with severe malaria, may have a growth advantage in immunologically naïve
individuals. However, this idea has not been tested in longitudinal studies.
METHODS: Here we assessed expression of the var genes encoding PfEMP1, in
parasites sampled from volunteers with varying prior exposure to malaria,
following experimental infection by sporozoites (PfSPZ). Using qPCR, we tested
for associations between the expression of various var subgroups in surviving
parasite populations from each volunteer and 1) the levels of participants'
antibodies to infected erythrocytes before challenge infection and 2) the
apparent in vivo parasite multiplication rate.
RESULTS: We show that 1) expression of var genes encoding for group A and
DC8-like PfEMP1 were associated with low levels of antibodies to infected
erythrocytes (αIE) before challenge, and 2) expression of a DC8-like CIDRα1.1
domain was associated with higher apparent parasite multiplication rate in a
manner that was independent of levels of prior antibodies to infected
erythrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the role of antibodies to infected 
erythrocytes surface antigens in the development of naturally acquired immunity
and may help explain why specific PfEMP1 variants may be associated with severe
malaria.
