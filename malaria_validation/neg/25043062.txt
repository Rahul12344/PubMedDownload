Antigenic variation of the Plasmodium falciparum multicopy var gene family
enables parasite evasion of immune destruction by host antibodies. Expression of 
a particular var subgroup, termed upsA, is linked to the obstruction of blood
vessels in the brain and to the pathogenesis of human cerebral malaria. The
mechanism determining upsA activation remains unknown. Here we show that an
entirely new type of gene silencing mechanism involving an exonuclease-mediated
degradation of nascent RNA controls the silencing of genes linked to severe
malaria. We identify a novel chromatin-associated exoribonuclease, termed
PfRNase II, that controls the silencing of upsA var genes by marking their
transcription start site and intron-promoter regions leading to short-lived
cryptic RNA. Parasites carrying a deficient PfRNase II gene produce full-length
upsA var transcripts and intron-derived antisense long non-coding RNA. The
presence of stable upsA var transcripts overcomes monoallelic expression,
resulting in the simultaneous expression of both upsA and upsC type PfEMP1
proteins on the surface of individual infected red blood cells. In addition, we
observe an inverse relationship between transcript levels of PfRNase II and
upsA-type var genes in parasites from severe malaria patients, implying a crucial
role of PfRNase II in severe malaria. Our results uncover a previously unknown
type of post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism in malaria parasites with
repercussions for other organisms. Additionally, the identification of RNase II
as a parasite protein controlling the expression of virulence genes involved in
pathogenesis in patients with severe malaria may provide new strategies for
reducing malaria mortality.
