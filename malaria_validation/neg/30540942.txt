Inflammation-induced disappearance of tissue-resident macrophages represents a
key pathogen defense mechanism. Using a model of systemic blood-stage malaria, we
studied the dynamics of tissue-resident macrophages in multiple organs to
determine how they are depleted and refilled during the course of disease. We
show that Plasmodium infection results in a transient loss of embryonically
established resident macrophages prior to the parasitemia peak. Fate-mapping
analysis reveals that inflammatory monocytes contribute to the repopulation of
the emptied niches of splenic red pulp macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells,
while lung alveolar macrophages refill their niche predominantly through
self-renewal. Interestingly, the local microenvironment of the spleen and liver
can "imprint" the molecular characteristics of fetal-derived macrophages on newly
differentiated bone marrow-derived immigrants with remarkably similar gene
expression profiles and turnover kinetics. Thus, the mononuclear phagocytic
system has developed distinct but effective tissue-specific strategies to
replenish emptied niches to guarantee the functional integrity of the system.
