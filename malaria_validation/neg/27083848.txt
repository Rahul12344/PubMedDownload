Small molecular weight Bacillus lipases are industrially attractive because of
its alkaline optimum pH, broad substrate specificity and production in high yield
by overexpression both in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Its major
limitation of being mesophilic in nature is constantly targeted by laboratory
evolution studies. Herein metagenomically isolated Bacillus LipJ was randomly
evolved by error prone PCR and library of variants were screened for enhanced
thermostability. Point mutant Gln121Arg was extensively characterized and it
showed dramatic shift of Temp. opt to 50°C compared to 37°C for parent enzyme.
Thermostability studies at 45°C and 50°C determined six fold increase in half
life for point variant Gln121Arg compared to LipJ. Circular dichroism (CD) and
tryptophan fluorescence study established enhanced thermostability of Gln121Arg. 
Specific activity of point variant Gln121Arg was comparable to wild type with
increased substrate affinity (Km reduced). Reduced kcat for variant Gln121Arg
infer that kinetic and catalytic efficiency of mutant was compromised. Structural
implications by homolog modelling predicted Gln121 to be placed within longest
loop of the structure at surface. Localization of loop due to additional polar
interactions by Arg121 to protein core defines molecular basis of enhanced
thermostability of random point variant Gln121Arg.
