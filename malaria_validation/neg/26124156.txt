There is a pressing need for new antimicrobial therapies to combat globally
important drug-resistant human pathogens, including Plasmodium falciparum
malarial parasites, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Gram-negative bacteria,
including Escherichia coli. These organisms all possess the essential
methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, which is not
found in humans. The first dedicated enzyme of the MEP pathway,
1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (Dxr), is inhibited by the
phosphonic acid antibiotic fosmidomycin and its analogs, including the N-acetyl
analog FR900098 and the phosphoryl analog fosfoxacin. In order to identify
mutations in dxr that confer resistance to these drugs, a library of E. coli dxr 
mutants was screened at lethal fosmidomycin doses. The most resistant allele
(with the S222T mutation) alters the fosmidomycin-binding site of Dxr. The
expression of this resistant allele increases bacterial resistance to
fosmidomycin and other fosmidomycin analogs by 10-fold. These observations
confirm that the primary cellular target of fosmidomycin is Dxr. Furthermore,
cell lines expressing Dxr-S222T will be a powerful tool to confirm the mechanisms
of action of future fosmidomycin analogs.
