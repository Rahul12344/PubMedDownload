Resistance to pyrethroids (the ingredients in bed net insecticides) in the major 
malaria vector Anopheles funestus is threatening recent gains in the fight
against malaria. Here, we established the role of an over-expressed P450, A.
funestus CYP6AA1 in insecticides resistance. Transcription profiling of CYP6AA1
across Africa using microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that it is significantly more over-expressed in
southern African populations compared to West (Benin) and East African (Uganda). 
Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli coupled with metabolism assays
demonstrated that CYP6AA1 metabolises type I (permethrin) and type II
(deltamethrin) pyrethroids, as well as bendiocarb (a carbamate). Transgenic
Drosophila melanogaster flies over-expressing CYP6AA1 were significantly more
resistant to pyrethroid insecticides, permethrin and deltamethrin compared with
control flies not expressing the gene, validating the role of this gene in
pyrethroid resistance. In silico modelling and docking simulations predicted the 
intermolecular receptor-ligand interactions which allow this P450 to metabolise
the pyrethroids and bendiocarb. Validation of CYP6AA1 as a pyrethroid resistance 
gene makes it possible to monitor the spread of resistance in the field where
this P450 is over-expressed. Its potential cross-resistance role makes it
necessary to monitor the gene closely to inform control programs on molecular
basis of multiple resistance in the field.
