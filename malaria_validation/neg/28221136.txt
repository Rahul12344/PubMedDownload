Malaria parasites evade immune detection by growth and replication within
erythrocytes. After erythrocyte invasion, the intracellular pathogen must
increase host cell uptake of nutrients from plasma. Here, we report that the
parasite-encoded RhopH complex contributes to both invasion and channel-mediated 
nutrient uptake. As rhoph2 and rhoph3 gene knockouts were not viable in the human
P. falciparum pathogen, we used conditional knockdowns to determine that the
encoded proteins are essential and to identify their stage-specific functions. We
exclude presumed roles for RhopH2 and CLAG3 in erythrocyte invasion but implicate
a RhopH3 contribution either through ligand-receptor interactions or subsequent
parasite internalization. These proteins then traffic via an export translocon to
the host membrane, where they form a nutrient channel. Knockdown of either RhopH2
or RhopH3 disrupts the entire complex, interfering with organellar targeting and 
subsequent trafficking. Therapies targeting this complex should attack the
pathogen at two critical points in its cycle.
