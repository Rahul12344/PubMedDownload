A survey was conducted to determine the distribution and prevalence of Toxoplasma
gondii and Babesia microti infections in small mammals captured in Gyeonggi and
Gangwon Provinces, Republic of Korea (ROK). The serological prevalence of T.
gondii (ELISA) and B. microti (IFAT) was 2.3% (15/667) and 2.1% (14/667),
respectively. DNA extracts from small mammal heart tissues were screened by PCR
for T. gondii and B. microti targeting regions of the GRA5 gene and the 18S rRNA 
and β-tubulin genes, respectively. Only 0.17% (1/578) of Apodemus agrarius was
positive of T. gondii by PCR, while 0.52% (3/578) was positive of B. microti. All
other small mammal species [Micromys minutus (16), Mus musculus (3), Myodes
regulus (22), Microtus fortis (6), and Crocidura lasiura (42)] were negative for 
both T. gondii and B. microti. Based on sequence polymorphism and phylogenetic
analysis, T. gondii closely aligned with Type I, a highly virulent strain, while 
B. microti positive samples closely aligned with US-type B. microti and others
observed in the ROK, Russia, and Japan. These results indicate that A. agrarius
is a reservoir for both T. gondii and B. microti in the ROK.
