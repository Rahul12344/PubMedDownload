BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes sequester in the
microcirculation due to interaction between surface-expressed parasite proteins
and endothelial receptors. Endothelial cells are covered in a carbohydrate-rich
glycocalyx that shields against undesired leukocyte adhesion. It was investigated
if the cellular glycocalyx affects the binding of P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes to CD36 in vitro.
METHODS: Glycocalyx growth was followed in vitro by using azido sugars and
cationized ferritin detecting O-glycoproteins and negatively charged
proteoglycans, respectively. P. falciparum (clone FCR3/IT) was selected on
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human CD36. Cytoadhesion to
CHO CD36 at 1-4 days after seeding was quantified by using a static binding
assay.
RESULTS: The glycocalyx thickness of CHO cells increased during 4 days in culture
as assessed by metabolic labelling of glycans with azido sugars and with electron
microscopy studying the binding of cationized ferritin to cell surfaces. The
functional importance of this process was addressed in binding assays by using
CHO cells transfected with CD36. In parallel with the maturation of the
glycocalyx, antibody-binding to CD36 was inhibited, despite stable expression of 
CD36. P. falciparum selected for CD36-binding recognized CD36 on CHO cells on the
first day in culture, but the binding was lost after 2-4 days.
CONCLUSION: The endothelial glycocalyx affects parasite cytoadhesion in vitro, an
effect that has previously been ignored. The previously reported loss of
glycocalyx during experimental malaria may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of malaria complications by allowing the close interaction between
infected erythrocytes and endothelial receptors.
