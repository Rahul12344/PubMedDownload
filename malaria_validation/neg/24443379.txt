Individuals living in endemic areas generally harbour multiple parasite strains. 
Multiplicity of infection (MOI) can be an indicator of immune status and
transmission intensity. It has a potentially confounding effect on a number of
population genetic analyses, which often assume isolates are clonal. Polymerase
chain reaction-based approaches to estimate MOI can lack sensitivity. For
example, in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, genotyping of the
merozoite surface protein (MSP1/2) genes is a standard method for assessing MOI, 
despite the apparent problem of underestimation. The availability of deep
coverage data from massively parallizable sequencing technologies means that MOI 
can be detected genome wide by considering the abundance of heterozygous
genotypes. Here, we present a method to estimate MOI, which considers unique
combinations of polymorphisms from sequence reads. The method is implemented
within the estMOI software. When applied to clinical P.falciparum isolates from
three continents, we find that multiple infections are common, especially in
regions with high transmission.
