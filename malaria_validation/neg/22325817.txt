INTRODUCTION: The genetic make-up of malaria parasite is potent for understanding
the parasite virulence, designing antimalarial vaccine and evaluating the impact 
of malaria control measures. There is a paucity of information on genetic
structure of Plasmodium falciparum in Jharkhand, India where malaria is rampant
and this study aimed to establish molecular characterization of P. falciparum
field isolates from Jharkhand measured with two highly polymorphic genetic
markers, i.e. the merozoite surface proteins (MSPs) 1 and 2.
METHODS: The genetic diversity of P. falciparum population from low transmission 
area, Ranchi, Bokaro and Hazaribagh and highly malarious area, Latehar and
Palamau districts of Jharkhand were evaluated by polymerase chain
reaction-sequencing analyzing msp-1 and msp-2 genes to explore the genetic
structure of parasite from this understudied region.
RESULTS: A total of 134 P. falciparum isolates were analyzed by polymorphic
regions of msp-1 and msp-2 and classified according to prevalence of allelic
families. The majority of patients from all the five sites had mean monoclonal
infections of 67·1 and 60·4% of P. falciparum for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively, 
whereas, mean multiple genotypes of 32·8 and 39·5% for msp-1 and msp-2,
respectively. Interestingly, we observed higher multiclonal infection in low
transmission area as compared to highly malarious area in the case of msp-1
genotypes, whereas in msp-2 higher multiclonal infection was observed in highly
malarious area compared to low transmission area. The overall multiplicities of
infection of msp-1 and msp-2 were 1·38 and 1·39, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report on molecular characterization of P.
falciparum field isolates from Jharkhand. The genetic diversity and allelic
distribution found in this study is somewhat similar to other reports from India 
and Southeast Asian countries. However, P. falciparum infection can be highly
complex and diverse in these disease-endemic regions of Jharkhand, suggesting
continual genetic mixing that could have significant implications for the use of 
antimalarial drugs and vaccines.
