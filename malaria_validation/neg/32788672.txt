Cerebral malaria (CM) is the deadliest form of severe Plasmodium infections.
Currently, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms by which Plasmodium
parasites induce CM. The mouse model of CM, experimental CM (ECM), induced by
infection with the rodent parasite, Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbANKA) has been
extensively used to study the pathophysiology of CM. Recent genomic analyses
revealed that the coding regions of PbANKA and the closely related Plasmodium
berghei NK65 (PbNK65), that does not cause ECM, differ in only 21 single
nucleotide polymorphysims (SNPs). Thus, the SNP-containing genes might contribute
to the pathogenesis of ECM. Although the majority of these SNPs are located in
genes of unknown function, one SNP is located in the DNA binding site of a member
of the Plasmodium ApiAP2 transcription factor family, that we recently showed
functions as a virulence factor alternating the host's immune response to the
parasite. Here, we investigated the impact of this SNP on the development of ECM.
Our results using CRISPR-Cas9 engineered parasites indicate that despite its
immune modulatory function, the SNP is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce
ECM and thus cannot account for parasite strain-specific differences in ECM
phenotypes.
