Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning represents a unique tool
for isolation and manipulation of large DNA molecules. The technique exploits a
high level of homologous recombination in the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae. So
far, TAR cloning is the only method available to selectively recover chromosomal 
segments up to 300Â kb in length from complex and simple genomes. In addition, TAR
cloning allows the assembly and cloning of entire microbe genomes up to several
Mb as well as engineering of large metabolic pathways. In this review, we
summarize applications of TAR cloning for functional/structural genomics and
synthetic biology.
