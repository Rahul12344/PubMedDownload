Anopheles mosquitoes transmit at least 200 million annual malaria infections
worldwide. Despite considerable genomic resources, mechanistic understanding of
biological processes in Anopheles has been hampered by a lack of tools for
reverse genetics. Here, we report successful application of the CRISPR/Cas9
system for highly efficient, site-specific mutagenesis in the diverse malaria
vectors Anopheles albimanus, A. coluzzii, and A. funestus When guide RNAs (gRNAs)
and Cas9 protein are injected at high concentration, germline mutations are
common and usually biallelic, allowing for the rapid creation of stable mutant
lines for reverse genetic analysis. Our protocol should enable researchers to
dissect the molecular and cellular basis of anopheline traits critical to
successful disease transmission, potentially exposing new targets for malaria
control.
