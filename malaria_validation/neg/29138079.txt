This study evaluated the influence of environmental heterogeneity on Anopheles
darlingi genetic and morphometric traits at a microgeographic level. Specimens of
An. darlingi collected from multiple municipalities in the Colombian malaria
endemic region Urabá-Bajo Cauca and Alto Sinú (UCS) were analyzed using 13
microsatellite loci. Spatial genetic structure, population variation and wing
geometric morphometric analyses were performed. Microsatellite results showed low
genetic differentiation and high gene flow among populations; four highly admixed
subpopulations were detected with no particular association to the
municipalities. Wing geometric morphometrics analysis showed a subtle but
significant difference in wing shape for El Bagre vs. Mutatá populations,
possibly influenced by geographical distance. Discrimination among populations in
the morphospace showed a slight separation of the Tierralta population. There was
no significant correlation between the genetic and geographic or genetic and
environmental distances. We hypothesize that environmental heterogeneity in the
UCS region does not reach a threshold to affect population structure of An.
darlingi. Another possibility is that microsatellites are not sensitive enough to
detect existing structure. It remains to be determined which local factors govern
phenotypic variation among these populations and how, or whether these may affect
mosquito biology and transmission capacity.
