BACKGROUND: Genetic structural variation underpins a multitude of phenotypes,
with significant implications for a range of biological outcomes. Despite their
crucial role, structural variants (SVs) are often neglected and overshadowed by
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are used in large-scale analysis
such as genome-wide association and population genetic studies.
RESULTS: To facilitate the high-throughput analysis of structural variation we
have developed an analytical pipeline and visualisation tool, called SV-Pop. The 
utility of this pipeline was then demonstrated through application with a large, 
multi-population P. falciparum dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Designed to facilitate downstream analysis and visualisation
post-discovery, SV-Pop allows for straightforward integration of multi-population
analysis, method and sample-based concordance metrics, and signals of selection.
