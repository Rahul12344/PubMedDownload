BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has pleiotropic functions during both the
demyelinating autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). How TNF regulates disability
during progressive disease remains unresolved. Using a progressive EAE model
characterized by sustained TNF and increasing morbidity, this study evaluates the
role of unregulated TNF in exacerbating central nervous system (CNS) pathology
and inflammation.
METHODS: Progressive MS was mimicked by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
peptide immunization of mice expressing a dominant negative IFN-γ receptor alpha 
chain under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (GFAPγR1∆).
Diseased GFAPγR1∆ mice were treated with anti-TNF or control monoclonal antibody 
during acute disease to monitor therapeutic effects on sustained disability,
demyelination, CNS inflammation, and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability.
RESULTS: TNF was specifically sustained in infiltrating macrophages. Anti-TNF
treatment decreased established clinical disability and mortality rate within 7
days. Control of disease progression was associated with a decline in myelin loss
and leukocyte infiltration, as well as macrophage activation. In addition to
mitigating CNS inflammation, TNF neutralization restored BBB integrity and
enhanced CNS anti-inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Sustained TNF production by infiltrating macrophages associated with
progressive EAE exacerbates disease severity by promoting inflammation and
disruption of BBB integrity, thereby counteracting establishment of an
anti-inflammatory environment required for disease remission.
