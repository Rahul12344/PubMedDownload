BACKGROUND: The production of recombinant proteins with proper conformation,
appropriate post-translational modifications in an easily scalable and
cost-effective system is challenging. Lactococcus lactis has recently been
identified as an efficient Gram positive cell factory for the production of
recombinant protein. We and others have used this expression host for the
production of selected malaria vaccine candidates. The safety of this production 
system has been confirmed in multiple clinical trials. Here we have explored L.
lactis cell factories for the production of 31 representative Plasmodium
falciparum antigens with varying sizes (ranging from 9 to 90 kDa) and varying
degree of predicted structural complexities including eleven antigens with
multiple predicted structural disulfide bonds, those which are considered
difficult-to-produce proteins.
RESULTS: Of the 31 recombinant constructs attempted in the L. lactis expression
system, the initial expression efficiency was 55% with 17 out of 31 recombinant
gene constructs producing high levels of secreted recombinant protein. The
majority of the constructs which failed to produce a recombinant protein were
found to consist of multiple intra-molecular disulfide-bonds. We found that these
disulfide-rich constructs could be produced in high yields when genetically fused
to an intrinsically disorder protein domain (GLURP-R0). By exploiting the
distinct biophysical and structural properties of the intrinsically disordered
protein region we developed a simple heat-based strategy for fast purification of
the disulfide-rich protein domains in yields ranging from 1 to 40 mg/l.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel procedure for the production and purification of
disulfide-rich recombinant proteins in L. lactis is described.
