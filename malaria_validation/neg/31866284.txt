Antibody cloning from single B cells is an essential tool for characterizing
humoral immune responses and obtaining valuable therapeutic and analytical
reagents. Antibody cloning from individuals with high serologic titers to HIV-1, 
Influenza, Malaria and ZIKV has led to new insights that inform vaccine design
efforts. In contrast to humans and mice, less is known about antibody cloning
from single B cells in macaques. Here, we describe a protocol to identify and
purify single antigen-specific macaque B cells, and subsequently clone and
produce macaque monoclonal antibodies. The sorting strategy requires the use of a
combination of fluorochrome labeled antigens and omission of anti-IgG antibodies 
that can interfere with antigen binding and vice versa. Optimized methods for
macaque antibody gene amplification, DNA preparation for antibody production and 
antibody screening by ELISA are also presented.
