Adult females of the genus Ixodes imbibe blood meals exceeding about 100 times
their own weight within 7‒9 days. During this period, ticks internalise
components of host blood by endocytic digest cells that line the tick midgut
epithelium. Using RNA-seq, we aimed to characterise the midgut transcriptome
composition in adult Ixodes ricinus females during early and late phase of
engorgement. To address specific adaptations to the haemoglobin-rich diet, we
compared the midgut transcriptomes of genetically homogenous female siblings fed 
either bovine blood or haemoglobin-depleted serum. We noted that tick gut
transcriptomes are subject to substantial temporal-dependent expression changes
between day 3 and day 8 of feeding. In contrast, the number of transcripts
significantly affected by the presence or absence of host red blood cells was
low. Transcripts relevant to the processes associated with blood-meal digestion
were analysed and involvement of selected encoded proteins in the tick midgut
physiology discussed. A total of 7215 novel sequences from I. ricinus were
deposited in public databases as an additional outcome of this study. Our results
broaden the current knowledge of tick digestive system and may lead to the
discovery of potential molecular targets for efficient tick control.
