Metabolic resistance to insecticides threatens malaria control. However, little
is known about its fitness cost in field populations of malaria vectors, thus
limiting the design of suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we
assessed the association between the glutathione S-transferase GSTe2-mediated
metabolic resistance and life-traits of natural populations of Anopheles
funestus. A total of 1200 indoor resting blood-fed female An. funestus (F₀) were 
collected in Mibellon, Cameroon (2016/2017), and allowed to lay eggs
individually. Genotyping of F1 mosquitoes for the L119F-GSTE2 mutation revealed
that L/L119-homozygote susceptible (SS) mosquitoes significantly laid more eggs
than heterozygotes L119F-RS (odds ratio (OR) = 2.06; p < 0.0001) and homozygote
resistant 119F/F-RR (OR = 2.93; p < 0.0001). L/L119-SS susceptible mosquitoes
also showed the higher ability for oviposition than 119F/F-RR resistant (OR =
2.68; p = 0.0002) indicating a reduced fecundity in resistant mosquitoes.
Furthermore, L119F-RS larvae developed faster (nine days) than L119F-RR and
L119F-SS (11 days) (X² = 11.052; degree of freedom (df) = 4; p = 0.02) suggesting
a heterozygote advantage effect for larval development. Interestingly, L/L119-SS 
developed faster than 119F/F-RR (OR = 5.3; p < 0.0001) revealing an increased
developmental time in resistant mosquitoes. However, genotyping and sequencing
revealed that L119F-RR mosquitoes exhibited a higher adult longevity compared to 
RS (OR > 2.2; p < 0.05) and SS (OR > 2.1; p < 0.05) with an increased frequency
of GSTe2-resistant haplotypes in mosquitoes of D30 after adult emergence.
Additionally, comparison of the expression of GSTe2 revealed a significantly
increased expression from D1-D30 after emergence of adults (Anova test (F) = 8;
df= 3; p = 0.008). The negative association between GSTe2 and some life traits of
An. funestus could facilitate new resistance management strategies. However, the 
increased longevity of GSTe2-resistant mosquitoes suggests that an increase in
resistance could exacerbate malaria transmission.
