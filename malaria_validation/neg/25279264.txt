Mosquito densoviruses (DNVs) are candidate agents for paratransgenic control of
malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Unlike other mosquito DNVs, the
Anopheles gambiae DNV (AgDNV) is non-pathogenic to larval mosquitoes. However,
the cost of infection upon adults and the molecular mechanisms underpinning
infection in the mosquito host are unknown. Using life table analysis, we show
that AgDNV infection has minimal effects on An. gambiae survival (no significant 
effect in 2 replicates and a slight 2 day survival decrease in the third
replicate). Using microarrays, we show that AgDNV has very minimal effect on the 
adult mosquito transcriptome, with only 4-15 genes differentially regulated
depending on the statistical criteria imposed. The minimal impact upon global
transcription provides some mechanistic understanding of lack of virus
pathogenicity, suggesting a long co-evolutionary history that has shifted towards
avirulence. From an applied standpoint, lack of strong induced fitness costs
makes AgDNV an attractive agent for paratransgenic malaria control.
