BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax resistance to chloroquine (CQ) has been reported
from many endemic regions in the world. Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 95%
of malaria cases in Afghanistan and CQ is the first-line treatment given for
vivax malaria. The pvmdr-1 and pvcrt-o (K10 insertion) genes are possible markers
for CQ-resistance in P. vivax isolates. There have been no studies done on the
presence or absence of molecular markers for CQ-resistance P. vivax in
Afghanistan. The present work aimed to evaluate the frequency of mutations in the
pvmdr-1 and K10 insertion in the pvcrt-o genes of P. vivax.
METHODS: Plasmodium vivax isolates were collected from Laghman, Baghlan and Khost
provinces. For investigation of polymorphisms of desired regions in pvmdr-1 and
pvcrt-o genes, sequencing was applied on the PCR products. A new asymmetric qPCR 
and melting analysis assay based on unlabelled probe developed for scanning of
K10 insertion in pvcrt-o gene.
RESULTS: The analysis of sequencing data of the pvmdr-1 gene showed wild type
Y976 and K997 and mutant M958 and L1076 in 33 isolates from three provinces. Of
the 36 samples evaluated for K10 insertion in pvcrt-o, 2/18(11%), 0/10(0%) and
0/8(0%) isolates from Laghman, Baghlan and Khost province, respectively,
possessed K10 insertion, confirmed by either sequencing and unlabelled probes.
CONCLUSION: Two samples with K10 insertion and 33 samples with pvmdr1
polymorphism, indicating on the possibility of CQ resistance in P. vivax
populations in Afghanistan. Furthermore, unlabelled probes are simple and
inexpensive alternative tools for screening of P. vivax mutations.
