BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for prophylactic
treatment of malaria in pregnancy while artemisinin combination therapy is the
recommended first-line anti-malarial treatment. Selection of SP resistance is
ongoing since SP is readily available in health facilities and in private drug
shops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study reports on the prevalence and
distribution of Pfdhps mutations A540E and A581G in Tanzania. When found
together, these mutations confer high-level SP resistance (sometimes referred to 
as 'super-resistance'), which is associated with loss in protective efficacy of
SP-IPTp.
METHODS: DNA samples were extracted from malaria-positive blood samples on filter
paper, used malaria rapid diagnostic test strips and whole blood collected from
eight sites in seven administrative regions of Tanzania. PCR-RFLP and SSOP-ELISA 
techniques were used to genotype the A540E and A581G Pfdhps. Data were analysed
using SPSS version 18 while Chi square and/or Fischer Exact tests were used to
compare prevalence between regions.
RESULTS: A high inter-regional variation of Pfdhps-540E was observed
(χ(2) = 76.8, p < 0.001). High inter-regional variation of 581G was observed
(FE = 85.3, p < 0.001). Both Tanga and Kagera were found to have the highest
levels of SP resistance. A high prevalence of Pfdhps-581G was observed in Tanga
(56.6 %) in northeastern Tanzania and in Kagera (20.4 %) in northwestern Tanzania
and the 540-581 EG haplotype was found at 54.5 and 19.4 %, respectively.
Pfdhps-581G was not detected in Pwani and Lindi regions located south of Tanga
region.
CONCLUSIONS: Selection of SP super-resistant Pfdhps A581G is highest in northern 
Tanzania. Variation in distribution of SP resistance is observed across the
country: northeastern Tanga region and northwestern Kagera region have highest
prevalence of SP super-resistance markers, while in Pwani and Lindi in the
southeast the prevalence of super-resistance was zero. More studies should be
conducted to understand the factors underlying the remarkable heterogeneity in SP
resistance in the country.
