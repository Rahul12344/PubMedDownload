Y chromosomes control essential male functions in many species, including sex
determination and fertility. However, because of obstacles posed by repeat-rich
heterochromatin, knowledge of Y chromosome sequences is limited to a handful of
model organisms, constraining our understanding of Y biology across the tree of
life. Here, we leverage long single-molecule sequencing to determine the content 
and structure of the nonrecombining Y chromosome of the primary African malaria
mosquito, Anopheles gambiae We find that the An. gambiae Y consists almost
entirely of a few massively amplified, tandemly arrayed repeats, some of which
can recombine with similar repeats on the X chromosome. Sex-specific genome
resequencing in a recent species radiation, the An. gambiae complex, revealed
rapid sequence turnover within An. gambiae and among species. Exploiting 52
sex-specific An. gambiae RNA-Seq datasets representing all developmental stages, 
we identified a small repertoire of Y-linked genes that lack X gametologs and are
not Y-linked in any other species except An. gambiae, with the notable exception 
of YG2, a candidate male-determining gene. YG2 is the only gene conserved and
exclusive to the Y in all species examined, yet sequence similarity to YG2 is not
detectable in the genome of a more distant mosquito relative, suggesting rapid
evolution of Y chromosome genes in this highly dynamic genus of malaria vectors. 
The extensive characterization of the An. gambiae Y provides a long-awaited
foundation for studying male mosquito biology, and will inform novel mosquito
control strategies based on the manipulation of Y chromosomes.
