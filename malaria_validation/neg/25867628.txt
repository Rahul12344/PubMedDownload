A renewed global commitment to malaria elimination lends urgency to understanding
the biology of Plasmodium transmission stages. Recent progress toward uncovering 
the mechanisms underlying Plasmodium falciparum sexual differentiation and
maturation reveals potential targets for transmission-blocking drugs and
vaccines. The identification of parasite factors that alter sexual
differentiation, including extracellular vesicles and a master transcriptional
regulator, suggest that parasites make epigenetically controlled developmental
decisions based on environmental cues. New insights into sexual development,
especially host cell remodeling and sequestration in the bone marrow, highlight
open questions regarding parasite homing to the tissue, transmigration across the
vascular endothelium, and maturation in the parenchyma. Novel molecular and
translational tools will provide further opportunities to define host-parasite
interactions and design effective transmission-blocking therapeutics.
