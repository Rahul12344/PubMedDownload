BACKGROUND: In the absence of an effective vaccine, malaria treatment and
eradication is still a challenge in most endemic areas globally. This is
especially the case with the current reported emergence of resistance to
artemisinin agents in Southeast Asia. This study therefore explored the
prevalence of K13-propeller gene polymorphisms among Plasmodium falciparum
parasites in northern Uganda.
METHODS: Adult patients (≥18 years) presenting to out-patients department of Lira
and Gulu regional referral hospitals in northern Uganda were randomly recruited. 
Laboratory investigation for presence of plasmodium infection among patients was 
done using Plasmodium falciparum exclusive rapid diagnostic test, histidine rich 
protein-2 (HRP2) (Pf). Finger prick capillary blood from patients with a positive
malaria test was spotted on a filter paper Whatman no. 903. The parasite DNA was 
extracted using chelex resin method and sequenced for mutations in K13-propeller 
gene using Sanger sequencing. PCR DNA sequence products were analyzed using in
DNAsp 5.10.01software, data was further processed in Excel spreadsheet 2007.
RESULTS: A total of 60 parasite DNA samples were sequenced. Polymorphisms in the 
K13-propeller gene were detected in four (4) of the 60 parasite DNA samples
sequenced. A non-synonymous polymorphism at codon 533 previously detected in
Cambodia was found in the parasite DNA samples analyzed. Polymorphisms at codon
522 (non-synonymous) and codon 509 (synonymous) were also found in the samples
analyzed. The study found evidence of positive selection in the Plasmodium
falciparum population in northern Uganda (Tajima's D = -1.83205; Fu and Li's
D = -1.82458).
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism in the K13-propeller gene previously reported in
Cambodia has been found in the Ugandan Plasmodium falciparum parasites. There is 
need for continuous surveillance for artemisinin resistance gene markers in the
country.
