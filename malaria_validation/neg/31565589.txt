Thalassemia is a genetic disorder due to deletion or mutation in the gene for
alpha or beta chain of hemoglobin. Gaucher's disease (GD) is characterized by a
deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase which occurs due to
mutations in the GBA1 gene on chromosome 1. Thalassemia and GD have overlapping
clinical manifestations and present with features such as anemia,
hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal involvement. This creates a diagnostic conundrum
for physicians. We present a case of an 11-month-old female who presented with
fever, increasing paleness, and labored breathing. She had a recent history of
uncross-matched transfusion. The child showed signs of anemic failure. Physical
exam findings strongly pointed towards hemolytic anemia due to thalassemia major.
Genetic analysis confirmed homozygosity in Fr 8-9 mutation confirming beta
thalassemia major. Bicytopenia along with visceromegaly indicated malaria or
storage diseases. Enzyme analysis revealed low levels of beta-glucocerebrosidase 
with normal acid sphingomyelinase levels confirming GD. In our case, we report
the association of beta thalassemia major with GD which is a rare entity. The
report highlights the need for an independent assessment of disorders that have
similar presentations to avoid missing an associated disorder.
