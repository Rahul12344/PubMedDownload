BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria is characterized by the presence of dormant 
liver-stage parasites, called hypnozoites, which can cause malaria relapses after
an initial attack. Primaquine, which targets liver hypnozoites, must be used in
combination with a schizonticidal agent to get the radical cure. However,
relapses can sometimes occur in spite of correct treatment, due to different
factors such as a diminished metabolization of primaquine.
CASE PRESENTATION: In January 2019, a 21 years old woman with residence in
Madrid, returning from a trip to Venezuela with clinical symptoms compatible with
malaria infection, was diagnosed with vivax malaria. Chloroquine for 3 days plus 
primaquine for 14 days was the elected treatment. Two months later and after a
second trip to Venezuela, the patient presented a second P. vivax infection,
which was treated as the previous one. A third P. vivax malaria episode was
diagnosed 2 months later, after returning from a trip to Morocco, receiving
chloroquine for 3 days but increasing to 28 days the primaquine regimen, and with
no more relapses after 6 months of follow up. The genotyping of P. vivax in the
three malaria episodes revealed that the same strain was present in the different
relapses. Upon confirmation of correct adherence to the treatment,
non-description of resistance in the infection area and the highly unlikely
re-infection on subsequent trips or stays in Spain, a possible metabolic failure 
was considered. CYP2D6 encodes the human cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6), 
responsible for primaquine activation. The patient was found to have a
CYP2D6*4/*1 genotype, which turns out in an intermediate metabolizer phenotype,
which has been related to P. vivax relapses.
CONCLUSIONS: The impairment in CYP2D6 enzyme could be the most likely cause of P.
vivax relapses in this patient. This highlights the importance of considering the
analysis of CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms in cases of P. vivax relapses after a
correct treatment and, especially, it should be considered in any study of dosage
and duration of primaquine treatment.
