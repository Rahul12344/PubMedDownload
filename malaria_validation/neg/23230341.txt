Resistance of Plasmodium spp. to anti-malarial drugs is the primary obstacle in
the fight against malaria, and molecular markers for the drug resistance have
been applied as an adjunct in the surveillance of the resistance. In this study, 
we investigated the prevalence of mutations in pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhfr, and
pvdhps genes in temperate-zone P. vivax parasites from central China. A total of 
26 isolates were selected, including 8 which were previously shown to have a
lower susceptibility to chloroquine in vitro. For pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, and pvdhps
genes, no resistance-conferring mutations were discovered. However, a highly
prevalent (69.2%), single-point mutation (S117N) was found in pvdhfr gene. In
addition, tandem repeat polymorphisms existed in pvdhfr and pvdhps genes, which
warranted further studies in relation to the parasite resistance to antifolate
drugs. The study further suggests that P. vivax populations in central China may 
still be relatively susceptible to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
