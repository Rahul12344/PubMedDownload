BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite
outside Africa and is the predominant parasite in the Americas. Increasing
reports of P. vivax disease severity, together with the emergence of
drug-resistant strains, underscore the urgency of the development of vaccines
against P. vivax. Polymorphisms on DBP-II-gene could act as an immune evasion
mechanism and, consequently, limited the vaccine efficacy. This study aimed to
investigate the pvdbp-II genetic diversity in two Brazilian regions with
different epidemiological patterns: the unstable transmission area in the
Atlantic Forest (AF) of Rio de Janeiro and; the fixed malaria-endemic area in
Brazilian Amazon (BA).
METHODS: 216 Brazilian P. vivax infected blood samples, diagnosed by microscopic 
examination and PCR, were investigated. The region flanking pvdbp-II was
amplified by PCR and sequenced. Genetic polymorphisms of pvdbp-II were estimated 
based on the number of segregating sites and nucleotide and haplotype
diversities; the degree of differentiation between-regions was evaluated applying
Wright's statistics. Natural selection was calculated using the rate of
nonsynonymous per synonymous substitutions with the Z-test, and the evolutionary 
distance was estimated based on the reconstructed tree.
RESULTS: 79 samples from AF and 137 from BA were successfully sequenced. The
analyses showed 28 polymorphic sites distributed in 21 codons, with only 5% of
the samples Salvador 1 type. The highest rates of polymorphic sites were found in
B- and T cell epitopes. Unexpectedly, the nucleotide diversity in pvdbp-II was
higher in AF (0.01) than in BA (0.008). Among the 28 SNPs detected, 18 are shared
between P. vivax isolates from AF and BA regions, but 8 SNPs were exclusively
detected in AF-I322S, K371N, E385Q, E385T, K386T, K411N, I419L and I419R-and 2
(N375D and I419M) arose exclusively in BA. These findings could suggest the
potential of these geographical clusters as population-specific-signatures that
may be useful to track the origin of infections. The sample size should be
increased in order to confirm this possibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that the pvdbp-II polymorphisms are positively
selected by host's immune pressure. The characterization of pvdbp-II
polymorphisms might be useful for designing effective DBP-II-based vaccines.
