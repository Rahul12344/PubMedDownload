BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites need to synthesize chitinase in order to go through
the peritrophic membrane, which is created around the mosquito midgut, to
complete its life cycle. In mammalian malaria species, the chitinase gene
comprises either a large or a short copy. In the avian malaria parasites
Plasmodium gallinaceum both copies are present, suggesting that a gene
duplication in the ancestor to these extant species preceded the loss of either
the long or the short copy in Plasmodium parasites of mammals. Plasmodium
gallinaceum is not the most widespread and harmful parasite of birds. This study 
is the first to search for and identify the chitinase gene in one of the most
prevalent avian malaria parasites, Plasmodium relictum.
METHODS: Both copies of P. gallinaceum chitinase were used as reference sequences
for primer design. Different sequences of Plasmodium spp. were used to build the 
phylogenetic tree of chitinase gene.
RESULTS: The gene encoding for chitinase was identified in isolates of two
mitochondrial lineages of P. relictum (SGS1 and GRW4). The chitinase found in
these two lineages consists both of the long (PrCHT1) and the short (PrCHT2)
copy. The genetic differences found in the long copy of the chitinase gene
between SGS1 and GRW4 were higher than the difference observed for the cytochrome
b gene.
CONCLUSION: The identification of both copies in P. relictum sheds light on the
phylogenetic relationship of the chitinase gene in the genus Plasmodium. Due to
its high variability, the chitinase gene could be used to study the genetic
population structure in isolates from different host species and geographic
regions.
