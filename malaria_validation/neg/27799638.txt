The emergence of artemisinin resistance among Plasmodium falciparum in the
Greater Mekong subregion threatens malaria control interventions and is
associated with multiple unique mutations in K13 (PF3D7_1343700). The aim of this
study was to survey Cambodian Plasmodium vivax for mutations in the K13 ortholog 
(K12, PVX_083080) that might similarly confer artemisinin resistance. Extracted
DNA from Cambodian isolates collected between 2009 and 2012 was pooled by
province and year and submitted for next-generation sequencing. Single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using a pile-up approach that detected
minority SNPs. Among the 14 pools, we found six unique SNPs, including three
nonsynonymous SNPs, across six codons in K12 However, none of the SNPs were
orthologous to artemisinin resistance-conferring mutations in PF3D7_1343700, and 
nonsynonymous changes did not persist through time within populations. These
results suggest a lack of selection in the P. vivax population in Cambodia due to
artemisinin drug pressure.
