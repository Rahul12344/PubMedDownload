Background: Antenatal exposure to parasites can affect infants' subsequent
responses to vaccination. The present study investigated how maternal prenatal
infections and newborns' antiparasite cytokine profiles relate to immunoglobulin 
G (IgG) responses to standard vaccination during infancy.
Methods: A total of 450 Kenyan women were tested for parasitic infections during 
pregnancy. Their newborns' responses to Plasmodium falciparum, schistosome, and
filaria antigens were assessed in cord blood lymphocytes. Following standard
neonatal vaccination, this infant cohort was followed biannually to age 30 months
for measurement of circulating IgG levels against Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib),
diphtheria toxoid (DT), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and tetanus toxoid.
Results: Trajectories of postvaccination IgG levels were classified by functional
principal component (PC) analysis to assess each child's response profile. Two
main components, PC1, reflecting height of response over time, and PC2,
reflecting crossover from high to low responses or from low to high responses,
were identified. Cord blood cytokine responses to schistosome and filarial
antigens showed a significant association between augmented antihelminth
interleukin 10 and reduced antibody levels, particularly to DT and HBV, and a
more rapid postvaccination decline in circulating IgG levels against Hib.
Conclusion: Antenatal sensitization to schistosomiasis or filariasis and related 
production of antiparasite interleukin 10 at birth are associated with reduced
antivaccine IgG levels in infancy, with possibly impaired protection.
