The salivary glands (SG) of ixodid ticks play a pivotal role in blood feeding,
producing both the cement and the saliva. The cement is an adhesive substance
that helps the attachment of the tick to the host skin, while the saliva contains
a rich mixture of antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory
substances that allow ticks to properly acquire the blood meal. The tick saliva
is also a vehicle used by several pathogens to be transmitted to the vertebrate
host, including various bacterial species from the genus Rickettsia. Rickettsia
rickettsii is a tick-borne obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the
severe Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In Brazil, the dog yellow tick Amblyomma
aureolatum is a vector of R. rickettsii. In the current study, the effects of an 
experimental infection with R. rickettsii on the global gene expression profile
of A. aureolatum SG was determined by next-generation RNA sequencing. A total of 
260 coding sequences (CDSs) were modulated by infection, among which 161 were
upregulated and 99 were downregulated. Regarding CDSs in the immunity category,
we highlight one sequence encoding one microplusin-like antimicrobial peptide
(AMP) (Ambaur-69859). AMPs are important effectors of the arthropod immune
system, which lack the adaptive response of the immune system of vertebrates. The
expression of microplusin was confirmed to be significantly upregulated in the SG
as well as in the midgut (MG) of infected A. aureolatum by a quantitative
polymerase chain reaction preceded by reverse transcription. The knockdown of the
microplusin expression by RNA interference caused a significant increase in the
prevalence of infected ticks in relation to the control. In addition, a higher
rickettsial load of one order of magnitude was recorded in both the MG and SG of 
ticks that received microplusin-specific dsRNA. No effect of microplusin
knockdown was observed on the R. rickettsii transmission to rabbits. Moreover, no
significant differences in tick engorgement and oviposition were recorded in
ticks that received dsMicroplusin, demonstrating that microplusin knockdown has
no effect on tick fitness. Further studies must be performed to determine the
mechanism of action of this AMP against R. rickettsii.
