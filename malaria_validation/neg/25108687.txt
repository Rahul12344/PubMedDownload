Malaria is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, and new strategies
for treating and preventing this disease are needed. Here we show that the
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 DNA endonuclease and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs)
produced using T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) efficiently edit the Plasmodium
falciparum genome. Targeting the genes encoding native knob-associated
histidine-rich protein (kahrp) and erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (eba-175), we 
achieved high (â‰¥ 50-100%) gene disruption frequencies within the usual time frame
for generating transgenic parasites.
