Plasmodium falciparum malaria imposes a serious public health concern throughout 
the tropics. Although genetic tools are principally important to fully
investigate malaria parasites, currently available forward and reverse tools are 
fairly limited. It is expected that parasites with a high mutation rate can
readily acquire novel phenotypes/traits; however, they remain an untapped tool
for malaria biology. Here, we generated a mutator malaria parasite (hereinafter
called a 'malaria mutator'), using site-directed mutagenesis and gene
transfection techniques. A mutator Plasmodium berghei line with a defective
proofreading 3' → 5' exonuclease activity in DNA polymerase δ (referred to as
PbMut) and a control P. berghei line with wild-type DNA polymerase δ (referred to
as PbCtl) were maintained by weekly passage in ddY mice for 122 weeks.
High-throughput genome sequencing analysis revealed that two PbMut lines had
175-178 mutations and a 86- to 90-fold higher mutation rate than that of a PbCtl 
line. PbMut, PbCtl, and their parent strain, PbWT, showed similar course of
infection. Interestingly, PbMut lost the ability to form gametocytes during
serial passages. We believe that the malaria mutator system could provide a novel
and useful tool to investigate malaria biology.
