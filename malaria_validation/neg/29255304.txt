Success in eliminating malaria will depend on whether parasite evolution outpaces
control efforts. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum parasites (the
deadliest of the species causing human malaria) found in
low-transmission-intensity areas have evolved to invest more in transmission to
new hosts (reproduction) and less in within-host replication (growth) than
parasites found in high-transmission areas. At the cellular level, this
adaptation manifests as increased production of reproductive forms (gametocytes) 
early in the infection at the expense of processes associated with multiplication
inside red blood cells, especially membrane transport and protein trafficking. At
the molecular level, this manifests as changes in the expression levels of genes 
encoding epigenetic and translational machinery. Specifically, expression levels 
of the gene encoding AP2-G-the transcription factor that initiates
reproduction-increase as transmission intensity decreases. This is accompanied by
downregulation and upregulation of genes encoding HDAC1 and HDA1-two histone
deacetylases that epigenetically regulate the parasite's replicative and
reproductive life-stage programmes, respectively. Parasites in reproductive mode 
show increased reliance on the prokaryotic translation machinery found inside the
plastid-derived organelles. Thus, our dissection of the parasite's adaptive
regulatory architecture has identified new potential molecular targets for
malaria control.
