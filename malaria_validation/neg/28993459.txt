The histozoic myxozoan parasite Kudoa thyrsites causes postmortem myoliquefaction
and is responsible for economic losses to salmon aquaculture in the Pacific
Northwest. Despite its importance, little is known about the host-parasite
relationship, including the host response to infection. The present work sought
to characterize the immune response in Atlantic salmon during infection,
recovery, and reexposure to K. thyrsites After exposure to infective seawater,
infected and uninfected smolts were sampled three times over 4,275 degree-days.
Histological analysis revealed infection severity decreased over time in exposed 
fish, while in controls there was no evidence of infection. Following a secondary
exposure of all fish, severity of infection in the controls was similar to that
measured in exposed fish at the first sampling time but was significantly reduced
in reexposed fish, suggesting the acquisition of protective immunity. Using
immunohistochemistry, we detected a population of MHIIβ+ cells in infected muscle
that followed a pattern of abundance concordant with parasite prevalence.
Infiltration of these cells into infected myocytes preceded destruction of the
plasmodium and dissemination of myxospores. Dual labeling indicated a majority of
these cells were CD83+/MHIIβ+ Using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, we
detected significant induction of cellular effectors, including
macrophage/dendritic cells (mhii/cd83/mcsf), B cells (igm/igt), and cytotoxic T
cells (cd8/nkl), in the musculature of infected fish. These data support a role
for cellular effectors such as antigen-presenting cells (monocyte/macrophage and 
dendritic cells) along with B and T cells in the acquired protective immune
response of Atlantic salmon against K. thyrsites.
