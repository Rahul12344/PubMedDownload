Polymorphic genetic markers and especially microsatellite analysis can be used to
investigate multiple aspects of the biology of Plasmodium species. In the current
study, we characterized 7 polymorphic microsatellites in a total of 281
Plasmodium vivax isolates to determine the genetic diversity and population
structure of P. vivax populations from Sudan, Madagascar, French Guiana, and
Armenia. All four parasite populations were highly polymorphic with 3-32 alleles 
per locus. Mean genetic diversity values was 0.83, 0.79, 0.78 and 0.67 for
Madagascar, French Guiana, Sudan, and Armenia, respectively. Significant genetic 
differentiation between all four populations was observed.
