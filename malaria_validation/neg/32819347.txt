BACKGROUND: As of today, cancer is still one of the most prevalent and
high-mortality diseases, summing more than 9 million deaths in 2018. This has
motivated researchers to study the application of machine learning-based
solutions for cancer detection to accelerate its diagnosis and help its
prevention. Among several approaches, one is to automatically classify tumor
samples through their gene expression analysis.
METHODS: In this work, we aim to distinguish five different types of cancer
through RNA-Seq datasets: thyroid, skin, stomach, breast, and lung. To do so, we 
have adopted a previously described methodology, with which we compare the
performance of 3 different autoencoders (AEs) used as a deep neural network
weight initialization technique. Our experiments consist in assessing two
different approaches when training the classification model - fixing the weights 
after pre-training the AEs, or allowing fine-tuning of the entire network - and
two different strategies for embedding the AEs into the classification network,
namely by only importing the encoding layers, or by inserting the complete AE. We
then study how varying the number of layers in the first strategy, the AEs latent
vector dimension, and the imputation technique in the data preprocessing step
impacts the network's overall classification performance. Finally, with the goal 
of assessing how well does this pipeline generalize, we apply the same
methodology to two additional datasets that include features extracted from
images of malaria thin blood smears, and breast masses cell nuclei. We also
discard the possibility of overfitting by using held-out test sets in the images 
datasets.
RESULTS: The methodology attained good overall results for both RNA-Seq and image
extracted data. We outperformed the established baseline for all the considered
datasets, achieving an average F1 score of 99.03, 89.95, and 98.84 and an MCC of 
0.99, 0.84, and 0.98, for the RNA-Seq (when detecting thyroid cancer), the
Malaria, and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the approach of fine-tuning the weights of the top 
layers imported from the AE reached higher results, for all the presented
experiences, and all the considered datasets. We outperformed all the previous
reported results when comparing to the established baselines.
