The development of resistance to insecticides has become a classic exemplar of
evolution occurring within human time scales. In this study we demonstrate how
resistance to DDT in the major African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is a
result of both target-site resistance mechanisms that have introgressed between
incipient species (the M- and S-molecular forms) and allelic variants in a
DDT-detoxifying enzyme. Sequencing of the detoxification enzyme, Gste2, from DDT 
resistant and susceptible strains of An. gambiae, revealed a non-synonymous
polymorphism (I114T), proximal to the DDT binding domain, which segregated with
strain phenotype. Recombinant protein expression and DDT metabolism analysis
revealed that the proteins from the susceptible strain lost activity at higher
DDT concentrations, characteristic of substrate inhibition. The effect of I114T
on GSTE2 protein structure was explored through X-ray crystallography. The amino 
acid exchange in the DDT-resistant strain introduced a hydroxyl group nearby the 
hydrophobic DDT-binding region. The exchange does not result in structural
alterations but is predicted to facilitate local dynamics and enzyme activity.
Expression of both wild-type and 114T alleles the allele in Drosophila conferred 
an increase in DDT tolerance. The 114T mutation was significantly associated with
DDT resistance in wild caught M-form populations and acts in concert with
target-site mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc-1575Y and
Vgsc-1014F) to confer extreme levels of DDT resistance in wild caught An.
gambiae.
