BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are two major parasites
responsible for malaria which remains a threat to almost 50% of world's
population despite decade-long eradication program. One possible reason behind
this conundrum is that the bases of clinical variability in malaria caused by
either species are complex and poorly understood.
METHODS: Whole-genome transcriptome was analyzed to identify the active and
predominant pathways in the PBMC of P. falciparum and P. vivax infected malaria
patients. Deregulated genes were identified and annotated using R Bioconductor
and DAVID/KEGG respectively. Genetic and functional regulation of CD14, a
prioritized candidate, were established by quantitative RT-PCR, genotyping using 
RFLP and resequencing, mapping of transcription factor binding using CONSITE and 
TFBIND, dual luciferase assay, western blot analysis, RNAi- mediated gene
knockdown and chromatin-immunoprecipation.
FINDINGS: The study highlighted that deregulation of host immune and inflammatory
genes particularly CD14 as a key event in P. falciparum malaria. An abundance of 
allele-C of rs5744454, located in CD14 promoter, in severe malaria motivated us
to establish an allele-specific regulation of CD14 by SP1. An enhancement of SP1 
and CD14 expression was observed in artemisinin treated human monocyte cell line.
INTERPRETATION: Our data not only reinstates that CD14 of TLR pathway plays a
predominant role in P. falciparum malaria, it establishes a functional basis for 
genetic association of rs5744454 with P. falciparum severe malaria by
demonstrating a cis-regulatory role of this promoter polymorphism. Moreover, the 
study points towards a novel pharmacogenetic aspect of artemisinin-based
anti-malarial therapy. FUND: DST-SERB, Govt. of India, SR/SO/HS-0056/2013.
