The balance between pro- and antiinflammatory mechanisms is essential to limit
immune-mediated pathology, and CD4+ forkhead box P3 (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells
(Treg) play an important role in this process. The expression of inhibitory
receptors regulates cytokine production by Plasmodium vivax-specific T cells. Our
goal was to assess the induction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) on Treg during malaria and to evaluate their
function. We found that P. vivax infection triggered an increase in circulating
Treg and their expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1. Functional analysis demonstrated
that Treg from malaria patients had impaired suppressive ability and PD-1+Treg
displayed lower levels of Foxp3 and Helios, but had higher frequencies of T-box
transcription factor+ and interferon-gamma+ cells than PD-1-Treg. Thus malaria
infection alters the function of circulating Treg by triggering increased
expression of PD-1 on Treg that is associated with decreased regulatory function 
and increased proinflammatory characteristics.
