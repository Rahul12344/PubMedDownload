Introduction: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most
common enzymopathy with a relatively high frequency in malaria-endemic regions.
In Eritrea, there is scanty knowledge of G6PD deficiency. The aim of the study
was to characterize and determine the prevalence of four common G6PD allelic
variants.
Methods: Three hundred and fourteen dried blood spot samples from unrelated
microscopically diagnosed malaria patient Eritrean ethnic groups living in five
zobas (regions) of Eritrea were analysed by PCR-RFLP method to identify the G6PD 
B, G6PD A (A376G), G6PD A-(G202A), and G6PD Mediterranean (C563T) variants. To
confirm the RFLP results, samples positive for A376G but negative for G202A
variants were subjected to Sanger sequencing and a subset of PCR products (exon
5) directly sequenced to identify A376G and other mutations.
Results: For G6PD genotyping, G6PD B was detected in 87.5% and A376G detected in 
12.5% of malaria patients, whereas G202A and C563T were absent. Bivariate
Statistical analysis showed a statistically significant association between G6PD 
genotypes and zoba (P < 0.004 < 0.05). Sequencing revealed the expected A376G
variant. In exon 5, four common (A376G) mutations, three uncommon mutations
rs782669677 (535G→A) and one potentially new mutation (451G→C), relative to the
reference, mRNA NM_001042351 were detected. Bioinformatic analysis of these
mutations' potential functional impact suggests minimal effect on protein
function.
Conclusion: This is the first report indicating that G6PD B and G6PD A genotypes 
are prevalent in Eritrea. Similar findings were reported in neighboring
countries. Further studies including phenotype analysis are needed to corroborate
the observed results.
