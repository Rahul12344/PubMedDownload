RTS,S is an advanced malaria vaccine candidate and confers significant protection
against Plasmodium falciparum infection in humans. Little is known about the
molecular mechanisms driving vaccine immunity. Here, we applied a systems biology
approach to study immune responses in subjects receiving three consecutive
immunizations with RTS,S (RRR), or in those receiving two immunizations of
RTS,S/AS01 following a primary immunization with adenovirus 35 (Ad35) (ARR)
vector expressing circumsporozoite protein. Subsequent controlled human malaria
challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after
the final immunization, resulted in ∼50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. 
Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were
associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower
antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell
responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and plasma
cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers prechallenge 
and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of innate
immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with protection in 
the ARR cohort. For both vaccine regimens, natural killer (NK) cell signatures
negatively correlated with and predicted protection. These results suggest that
protective immunity against P. falciparum can be achieved via multiple mechanisms
and highlight the utility of systems approaches in defining molecular correlates 
of protection to vaccination.
