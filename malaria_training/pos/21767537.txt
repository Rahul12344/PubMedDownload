It is considered that several glycoproteins on erythrocytes in mammalian species 
are involved in malaria parasite infection. To elucidate the role of N-glycans on
malaria parasite infection, we induced experimental murine malaria infection
(using Plasmodium berghei ANKA) in mice deficient in
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5), which is one of the enzymes involved
in β1,6-GlcNAc N-glycan biosynthesis. After infection, Mgat5(-/-) mice showed
severe body weight loss and parasitemia compared with wild-type mice. The
Mgat5(-/-) mice, but not wild-type mice, also showed severe pathology accompanied
by marked infiltration of plasma cells into the lungs and liver. These results
suggest that β1,6-GlcNAc N-glycans on/in host erythrocytes may interfere with
invasion of the parasites and progression to severe malaria.
