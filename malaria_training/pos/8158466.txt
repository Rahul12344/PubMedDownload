Babesia equi was continuously cultured through 90 passages in an enriched
chemically defined basal medium (HL-1) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum
and serum replacement factors, including lipid-rich bovine serum albumin, bovine 
insulin, and human transferrin. Cryopreservation and subsequent recovery of B.
equi were easily achieved. Inoculation of a splenectomized and an intact horse
with cultured infected erythrocytes resulted in parasitemias and B. equi in vitro
reisolation from both animals. In vitro forms of the parasite resembled in vivo
forms. After establishment, parasitemias of 10-15% were commonly observed.
