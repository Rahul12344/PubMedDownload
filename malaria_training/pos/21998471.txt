Murine cerebral malaria is a complex disease caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA
infection. Several cell types, including CD8(+) T cells, are essential effectors 
of disease. Although the use of transgenic parasites expressing model antigens
has revealed the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for these
model antigens, there is no direct evidence for a response to authentic
blood-stage parasite antigens, nor any knowledge of its magnitude. Our studies
show that there is a dramatic primary parasite-specific CTL response, akin to
viral immunity, reaching approximately 30% of splenic CD8(+) T cells, with many
producing interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cells express granzyme 
B and other markers of specific responders, are cytolytic, and respond to a broad
array of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-restricted epitopes, 5 of which
are identified here. Our studies indicate that vigorous CTL responses can be
induced to pathogens even when they largely reside in red blood cells, which lack
MHC I processing machinery.
