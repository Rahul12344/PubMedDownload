School nurses collect data to report to their school district and state agencies.
However, there is no national requirement or standard to collect specific data,
and each state determines its own set of questions. This study resulted from a
joint resolution between the National Association of State School Nurse
Consultants and the National Association of School Nurses. The study sought to
determine whether similar data points were collected so that comparisons could be
made among states and to develop a framework to incorporate the data. Thirty-two 
states provided their questionnaires or reports. There were 855 data points that 
could be divided into data related to staff and to students. No categories were
measured by all states. The most common data points were the number of students, 
health screenings, and the number of students with particular conditions for whom
the district provided services. A framework for data collection is proposed.
