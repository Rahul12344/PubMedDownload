BACKGROUND: Various factors impact the severity of malaria, including the
nutritional status of the host. Vitamin E, an intra and extracellular
anti-oxidant, is one such nutrient whose absence was shown previously to
negatively affect Plasmodium development. However, mechanisms of this Plasmodium 
inhibition, in addition to means by which to exploit this finding as a
therapeutic strategy, remain unclear.
METHODS: alpha-TTP knockout mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei NK65 or
Plasmodium yoelii XL-17, parasitaemia, survival rate were monitored. In one part 
of the experiments mice were fed with a supplemented diet of vitamin E and then
infected. In addition, parasite DNA damage was monitored by means of comet assay 
and 8-OHdG test. Moreover, infected mice were treated with chloroquine and
parasitaemia and survival rate were monitored.
RESULTS: Inhibition of alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP), a
determinant of vitamin E concentration in circulation, confers resistance to
malarial infection as a result of oxidative damage to the parasites. Furthermore,
in combination with the anti-malarial drug chloroquine results were even more
dramatic.
CONCLUSION: Considering that these knockout mice lack observable negative impacts
typical of vitamin E deficiency, these results suggest that inhibition of
alpha-TTP activity in the liver may be a useful strategy in the prevention and
treatment of malaria infection. Moreover, a combined strategy of alpha-TTP
inhibition and chloroquine treatment might be effective against drug resistant
parasites.
