ACTH-dependent modulation of malaria immunity in mice.

van Zon AA, Eling WM, Schetters TP, Hermsen CC.

Tetracosactrin, a synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) analogue
delivered by osmotic minipumps implanted s.c. in mice induced a dose-dependent
increase of plasma corticosterone levels. In mice with an established immunity to
Plasmodium berghei the increase of the plasma corticosterone level due to
tetracosactrin treatment correlated with loss of immunity against this malaria
parasite. The observed plasma corticosterone levels associated with loss of
malaria immunity were of the same order as those in mice that lost their immunity
during pregnancy. Adrenalectomy before administration of the ACTH analogue
prevented both the increase of plasma corticosterone and loss of malaria
immunity. Adrenalectomized mice still lost their malaria immunity when treated
with the synthetic corticoid dexamethasone. The effector function of malaria
immunity is sensitive to corticoids, and, at least during pregnancy, the
naturally occurring serum corticosterone level appears to be an important
regulator of malaria immunity.
