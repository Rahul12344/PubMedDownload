Plasmodium knowlesi (a simian malarial parasite) infection resulted in elevation 
of hepatic oxidative stress in monkeys. Further, the antioxidant defence system
of the host was also noticeably affected. The infected monkeys showed a marked
increase in the levels of superoxide (O2-), lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione
(GSH) and xanthine oxidase (XO), and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) and catalase. Oral administration of chloroquine (20 mg kg body wt-1 for 3 
days) to infected monkeys caused recovery trends in oxidative stress and
antioxidant defences to almost normal a week after cessation of drug treatment.
