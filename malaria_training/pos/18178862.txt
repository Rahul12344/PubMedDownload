Cerebral malaria (CM) can be a fatal manifestation of Plasmodium falciparum
infection. Using murine models of malaria, we found much greater up-regulation of
a number of chemokine mRNAs, including those for CXCR3 and its ligands, in the
brain during fatal murine CM (FMCM) than in a model of non-CM. Expression of
CXCL9 and CXCL10 RNA was localized predominantly to the cerebral microvessels and
in adjacent glial cells, while expression of CCL5 was restricted mainly to
infiltrating lymphocytes. The majority of mice deficient in CXCR3 were found to
be protected from FMCM, and this protection was associated with a reduction in
the number of CD8+ T cells in brain vessels as well as reduced expression of
perforin and FasL mRNA. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ cells from C57BL/6 mice with
FMCM abrogated this protection in CXCR3-/- mice. Moreover, there were decreased
mRNA levels for the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin-alpha in 
the brains of mice protected from FMCM. These data suggest a role for CXCR3 in
the pathogenesis of FMCM through the recruitment and activation of pathogenic
CD8+ T cells.
