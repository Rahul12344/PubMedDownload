BACKGROUND: Impact of the pathophysiology of Plasmodium falciparum placental
malaria (PM) on the profile of some oxidative stress biomarkers and their
relationship with poor pregnancy outcomes in women remain unknown.
METHODS: Between 2013 and 2014, peripheral blood and placenta tissue from 120
Cameroonian women at delivery were assessed for maternal haemoglobin and,
parasitaemia respectively. Parasite accumulation in the placenta was investigated
histologically. The levels of oxidative stress biomarkers Malondialdehyde (MDA), 
Nitric Oxide (NO), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Gluthatione
(GSH) in the supernatant of teased placenta tissues were determined by
Colorimetric enzymatic assays.
RESULTS: Parasitaemia was inversely related to haemoglobin levels and birth
weight (P <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The level of lipid peroxide product
(MDA) was significantly higher in the malaria infected (P = 0.0047) and anaemic
(P = 0.024) women compared to their non-infected and non-anaemic counterparts,
respectively. A similar trend was observed with SOD levels, though not
significant. The levels of MDA also correlated positively with parasitaemia (P = 
0.0024) but negatively with haemoglobin levels (P = 0.002). There was no
association between parasitaemia, haemoglobin level and the other oxidative
stress biomarkers. From histological studies, levels of MDA associated positively
and significantly with placenta malaria infection and the presence of malaria
pigments. The levels of SOD, NO and CAT increased with decreasing leukocyte
accumulation in the intervillous space. Baby birth weight increased significantly
with SOD and CAT levels, but decreased with levels of GSH.
CONCLUSIONS: Placental P. falciparum infection may cause oxidative stress of the 
placenta tissue with MDA as a potential biomarker of PM, which alongside GSH
could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes (anaemia and low birth weight). This
finding contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology of P. falciparum 
placental malaria in women.
