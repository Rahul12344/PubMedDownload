In cerebral malaria, the binding of parasitized erythrocytes to the cerebral
endothelium and the consequent angiogenic dysregulation play a key role in
pathogenesis. Because vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is widely
regarded as a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, edema, inflammation, and
vascular remodeling, the plasma levels of VEGF and the soluble form of the VEGF
receptor (sVEGFR)-1 and -2 in uncomplicated malaria patients and healthy adults
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine their roles
in malaria. The results showed that VEGF and sVEGFR-2 levels were significantly
elevated in malaria patients compared with healthy adults. Moreover, it was
confirmed that malarial parasite antigens induced VEGF secretion from the human
mast cell lines HMC-1 or KU812 cell. This is the first report to suggest that the
interaction of VEGF and sVEGFR-2 is involved in the host immune response to
malarial infection and that malarial parasites induce VEGF secretion from human
mast cells.
