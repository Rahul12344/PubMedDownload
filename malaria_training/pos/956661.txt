The complement profile in babesiosis.

Chapman WE, Ward PA.

Rats have been infected with Babesia rodhaini, a protozoan agent that induces
immune complex disease. Assays for complement have revealed depletion of C2, C3, 
C4, C5, and whole complement in the course of infection. No evidence of depletion
in the alternative (properdin) pathway was found. These findings are consistent
with the conclusion that the classical complement pathway is activated during the
course of the protozoan infection.
