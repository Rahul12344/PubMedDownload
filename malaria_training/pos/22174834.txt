BACKGROUND: Because of its propensity to sequester in the placental intervillous 
space, Plasmodium falciparum can evade detection by peripheral smear in women
with placental malaria (PM). We evaluated host biomarkers as potential indicators
of occult PM infections.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a case-control design, we evaluated the ability of
biomarkers to identify PM in the absence of circulating peripheral parasites (n =
24) compared to placental smear-negative controls (n = 326). We measured levels
of biomarkers (C3a, C5a, CRP, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, sTie-2, sEndoglin, 
VEGF, sFlt-1, tissue factor, and leptin) in maternal peripheral plasma at
delivery. Using ROC curve analysis, we assessed the ability of clinical
parameters and biomarkers to accurately detect PM infections identified by
placental smear. We show that decreases in sFlt-1 and leptin and increases in CRP
were associated with occult PM infections (p<0.01) and correlated with placental 
parasitaemia (p<0.01). Individually, all markers had moderate ability to diagnose
occult PM infections with areas under the ROC between 0.62 and 0.72. In order to 
improve diagnostic performance, we generated simple scoring systems to identify
PM infections using either a clinical score (0-2), a biomarker score (0-3) or a
clinical plus biomarker score (0-5). The combinatorial model that incorporated
both clinical parameters and biomarkers had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.85
(95% CI, 0.81-0.89), which was significantly better at identifying occult PM
infections than the clinical score alone (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that host biomarkers in the maternal peripheral
blood may improve the detection of PM in the absence of peripheral parasitaemia.
