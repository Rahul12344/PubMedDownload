Infection of erythrocytes by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum results
in the export of several parasite proteins into the erythrocyte cytoplasm.
Changes occur in the infected erythrocyte due to altered phosphorylation of
proteins and to novel interactions between host and parasite proteins,
particularly at the membrane skeleton. In erythrocytes, the spectrin based red
cell membrane skeleton is linked to the erythrocyte plasma membrane through
interactions of ankyrin with spectrin and band 3. Here we report an association
between the P. falciparum histidine-rich protein (PfHRP1) and phosphorylated
proteolytic fragments of red cell ankyrin. Immunochemical, biochemical and
biophysical studies indicate that the 89 kDa band 3 binding domain and the 62 kDa
spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin are co-precipitated by mAb 89 against PfHRP1, 
and that native and recombinant ankyrin fragments bind to the 5' repeat region of
PfHRP1. PfHRP1 is responsible for anchoring the parasite cytoadherence ligand to 
the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, and this additional interaction with ankyrin
would strengthen the ability of PfEMP1 to resist shear stress.
