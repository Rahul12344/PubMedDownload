Malaria is considered to be one of the most prevalent diseases in the world.
Severity of the disease between males and females is very important in clinical
research areas. In this study, we investigated the impact of sex differences in
brain response to infection with Plasmodium berghei. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice
were infected with P. berghei-infected erythrocytes. The infection induced a
significant change in weight loss in males (-7.2 % ± 0.5) than females (-4.9
% ± 0.6). The maximum parasitemia reached about 15 % at day 9 postinfection.
Also, P. berghei infection caused histopathological changes in the brain of mice.
These changes were in the form of inflammation, hemorrhage, and structural
changes in Purkinje cells. In addition, P. berghei was able to induce a marked
oxidative damage in mice brain. The infection induced a significant increase in
male brain glutathione than females while the brain catalase level was
significantly increased in infected females than infected males. Moreover, the
change in brain neurotransmitters, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
serotonin, was more in infected males than infected females. At the molecular
level, P. berghei was able to induce upregulations of Adam23, Cabp1, Cacnb4,
Glrb, and Vdac3-mRNA in the brain of mice. These genes were significantly
upregulated in infected males than in infected females. In general, P. berghei
could induce structural, biochemical, and molecular alterations in mice brain.
Severity of these alterations was different according to sex of mice.
