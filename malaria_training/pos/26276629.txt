Chronic infection with Plasmodium falciparum was epidemiologically associated
with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, a mature B cell cancer characterized by
chromosome translocation between the c-myc oncogene and Igh, over 50 years ago.
Whether infection promotes B cell lymphoma, and if so by which mechanism, remains
unknown. To investigate the relationship between parasitic disease and
lymphomagenesis, we used Plasmodium chabaudi (Pc) to produce chronic malaria
infection in mice. Pc induces prolonged expansion of germinal centers (GCs),
unique compartments in which B cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and express
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA mutator. GC B cells elicited
during Pc infection suffer widespread DNA damage, leading to chromosome
translocations. Although infection does not change the overall rate, it modifies 
lymphomagenesis to favor mature B cell lymphomas that are AID dependent and show 
chromosome translocations. Thus, malaria infection favors mature B cell cancers
by eliciting protracted AID expression in GC B cells. PAPERCLIP.
