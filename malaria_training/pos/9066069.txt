A lysate of Theileria sergenti-infected bovine red blood cells induced in vitro
proliferation of mouse spleen cells in a 2-3-day incubation period. Experiments
using B or T cell-enriched preparations showed that a B cell (B220+ CD3-
population) was responsible for this non-specific proliferation. In the culture
supernatant of spleen cells stimulated with the lysate, considerable amounts of
interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) were revealed after 2 days,
followed by production of immunoglobulin with a peak at 4-6 days. Thus, it was
suggested that a lysate antigen(s) of T. sergenti-infected red blood cells was
able to stimulate mouse spleen cells to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma, which in turn
induced the proliferation of B cells and production of immunoglobulin.
