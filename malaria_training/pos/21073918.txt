Experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) resulting from Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) 
infection in C57BL/6J mice manifests cell death in the brain. However, the
precise molecular and biochemical mechanisms regulating cell death during ECM
remains unknown. In this study we have examined, the role of a stress activated
protein kinase called c-Jun N terminal kinase during the pathology of ECM. We
report in this study, for the first time the activation of all key elements in
the JNK pathway like p-MKK4, p-JNK and p-c-Jun in mouse brain during ECM.
Concomitant with such activation was the up regulation of p-JNK and its
translocation into the nucleus leading to the phosphorylation of its major
substrate c-Jun. These observations show the neuronal induction of p-JNK and its 
critical role as a mediator in neuronal cell death during ECM.
