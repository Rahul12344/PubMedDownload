Asymptomatic malaria infections are highly prevalent in malaria endemic regions
and most of these infections remain undiagnosed and untreated. Whereas
conventional malaria symptoms are by definition absent, little is known on the
more subtle health consequences of these infections. The aim of our study was to 
analyze the hematologic, vascular and inflammatory effects of patent and
subpatent asymptomatic malaria parasitemia in children and adults on the
Indonesian island Sumba. Both children and adults with parasitemia had increased 
high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels compared to aparasitemic individuals. In
addition, children, but not adults with parasitemia also had lower platelet
counts and Hb levels and higher levels of von Willebrand factor and platelet
factor-4, markers of endothelial and platelet activation, respectively. These
findings suggest that asymptomatic malaria infections have subtle health
consequences, especially in children, and should be regarded as potentially
harmful.
