This study builds upon the established genetic control of antimalarial immune
responses and prior association studies by using a family-based approach,
transmission disequilibrium testing, to identify immune response genes that
influence antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum infection in an endemic
Tanzanian population. Candidate polymorphisms are within the interleukin-1 (IL-1)
gene cluster, the IL-10 promoter, Major histocompatibility complex class II and
III, the 5q31-q33 region, and the T-Cell Receptor beta variable region. There was
a significant association between the IL1RN alleles and total IgE. Weak evidence 
for association was present between polymorphisms in the IL10 promoter region and
both anti-P falciparum IgE and IgG4 antibodies.
