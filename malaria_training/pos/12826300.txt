The antidiarrhoeal effects of the methanol extract of Zizyphus spina-christi stem
bark were evaluated in laboratory rodents. Studies on castor oil induced
diarrhoea, intraluminal fluid accumulation, and gastrointestinal transit time
were carried out. Results obtained revealed that the extract caused a dose
dependent protection of rats against castor oil induced diarrhoea, decreased the 
intraluminal fluid accumulation and gastrointestinal transit. The intraperitoneal
and oral LD(50) values were found to be 346+/-5.6 and 1200+/-41.2 mg/kg in mice. 
Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of glycosides, resins, 
saponins, and tannins. It is suggested that the extract may contain biologically 
active components that may be useful against diarrhoea, thereby justifying its
use in ethnomedical practice as an antidiarrhoeal agent.
