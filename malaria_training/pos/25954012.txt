Efforts to identify host determinants for malaria have been hindered by the
absence of a nucleus in erythrocytes, which precludes genetic manipulation in the
cell in which the parasite replicates. We used cultured red blood cells derived
from hematopoietic stem cells to carry out a forward genetic screen for
Plasmodium falciparum host determinants. We found that CD55 is an essential host 
factor for P. falciparum invasion. CD55-null erythrocytes were refractory to
invasion by all isolates of P. falciparum because parasites failed to attach
properly to the erythrocyte surface. Thus, CD55 is an attractive target for the
development of malaria therapeutics. Hematopoietic stem cell-based forward
genetic screens may be valuable for the identification of additional host
determinants of malaria pathogenesis.
