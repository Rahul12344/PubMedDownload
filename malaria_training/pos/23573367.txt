The mechanisms of malaria anemia remain incompletely understood although much
effort has been put on studies in both human and murine systems. Hematopoiesis is
regulated by the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of erythropoietic 
progenitor cells into erythrocytes and is tightly controlled by a complex
communication network of cytokines as signal mediators. The present study used
the murine P. yoelii 17XNL malaria model to investigate the profile of cytokines 
and leukocytes throughout the entire infection. Moreover, malaria induced anemia 
was studied in comparison with anemia induced by hemorrhage and hemolysis. During
the P. yoelii infection, the levels of erythropoietic-related cytokines, such as 
G-CSF, GMCSF, IL-7, and IL-17, were pronouncedly reduced, while those of
regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TNF-Î±, were constantly increased. This
cytokine profile corresponded well with the cellular composition during the
infection, such as drastically decreased levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The
cytokine profile during malarial anemia showed the same characteristics as anemia
induced by hemorrhage or hemolysis. This study demonstrates that a markedly
dysregulated cytokine network occurred in this murine malaria model, which may
open a new window of insight into the mechanisms of malaria related anemia.
