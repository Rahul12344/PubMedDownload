Babesia bovis (= argentina): changes in erythrophylic and associated proteins
during acute infection of splenectomized and intact calves.

Goodger BV.

Saline eluates were prepared from sucrose-washed erythrocytes of cattle infected 
with B. bovis (= argentina). Fibrinogen, plasminogen and IgG2 were constituent
proteins of the eluates and all three proteins increased in concentration during 
infection. The significance of the protein changes and their contribution to
coagulation and fibrinolysis during infection are discussed.
