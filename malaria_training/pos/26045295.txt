BACKGROUND: Plasmodium parasites typically elicit a non-sterile but protective
immune response in human host populations, suggesting that the parasites actively
modulate normal immunological mechanisms. P-selectin is a cell surface receptor
expressed in mammals, that is a known component of the inflammatory response
against pathogens and has been previously identified as a host factor that
influences malaria-associated pathology both in human patients and rodent
infection models.
METHODS: To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement
of P-selectin in the pathogenesis of malaria, a systematic extracellular protein 
interaction screen was used to identify Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
protein 7 (MSP7) as a binding partner of human P-selectin. This interaction, and 
those occurring between P-selectin and Plasmodium MSP7 homologues, was
characterized biochemically.
RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum MSP7 and P-selectin were shown to bind each other 
directly via the N-terminus of PfMSP7 and the P-selectin C-type lectin and
EGF-like domains. Orthologous proteins in the murine parasite Plasmodium berghei 
(PbMSRP1 and PbMSRP2) and mouse P-selectin also interacted. Finally, P-selectin, 
when complexed with MSP7, could no longer bind to its endogenous carbohydrate
ligand, Sialyl-Lewis(X).
CONCLUSIONS: Novel interactions were identified between Plasmodium MSP7 protein
family members and host P-selectin receptors. Since PfMSP7 could prevent
interactions between P-selectin and its leukocyte ligands, these results provide 
a possible mechanism for the known immunomodulatory effects of both MSP7 and
P-selectin in malaria infection models.
