Populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection develop genetic mechanisms
of protection against severe malarial disease. Despite decades of genetic
epidemiological research, the sickle cell trait (HbAS) sickle cell polymorphism, 
ABO blood group, and other hemoglobinopathies remain the few major determinants
in severe malaria to be replicated across different African populations and study
designs. Within a case-control study in a region of high transmission in Tanzania
(n = 983), we investigated the role of 40 new loci identified in recent
genome-wide studies. In 32 loci passing quality control procedures, we found
polymorphisms in USP38, FREM3, SDC1, DDC, and LOC727982 genes to be putatively
associated with differential susceptibility to severe malaria. Established
candidates explained 7.4% of variation in severe malaria risk (HbAS polymorphism,
6.3%; α-thalassemia, 0.3%; ABO group, 0.3%; and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency, 0.5%) and the new polymorphisms, another 4.3%. The regions
encompassing the loci identified are promising targets for the design of future
treatment and control interventions.
