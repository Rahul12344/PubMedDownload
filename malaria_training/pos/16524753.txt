Notch is constitutively active in Theileria-transformed B cells and can be
further stimulated by the filarial nematode-secreted product, ES-62.

Theileria parva-infected B cells express Jagged-1 and activate Notch signalling
in a parasite-dependent manner. ES-62, a filarial nematode-secreted
phosphorylcholine-containing glycoprotein, is able to further stimulate
Notch-mediated signalling in parasitized cells. Notch is also activated to a
similar extent by addition of exogenous IL-10, and this occurs prior to any
increase in proliferation in T. parva-infected B cells.
