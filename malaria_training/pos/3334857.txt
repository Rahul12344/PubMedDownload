In its blood stages the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, displays very high lipid
metabolism. We present evidence for an abundant long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase
(EC 6.2.1.3) activity in Plasmodium knowlesi-infected simian erythrocytes. The
activity was found to be 20-fold higher in the schizont-infected (the last
parasite stage) than in control erythrocytes. The cosubstrate requirements of the
enzyme were similar to those previously reported for acyl-CoA synthetases from
other sources. Among the separated reaction products of oleyl-CoA synthetase,
only PPi and oleyl-CoA were inhibitory, with Ki over 350 microM. The fatty acid
specificity of the parasite acyl-CoA synthetase activity was fairly marked and
depended on the unsaturation state of the substrate. The tested fatty acids
displayed similar Vmax, whereas their Km ranged from 11 (palmitate) to 59 microM 
(arachidonate). Finally, experiments involving heat inactivation and separation
on hydroxyapatite excluded the presence of a specific arachidonyl-CoA synthetase 
identical to those present in other cells. On the other hand, fatty acid
competition experiments evidenced the existence of at least two distinct
enzymatic sites for fatty acid activation in P. knowlesi-infected simian
erythrocytes: one is specific for saturated fatty acids and the other for
polyunsaturated species, whereas oleate could be activated at both sites.
