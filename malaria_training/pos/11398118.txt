In vitro studies have shown that inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage 
parasite growth by antibody-dependent cellular inhibition is mediated by
cooperation between malaria-specific IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2, and monocytes
via the Fcgamma receptor II (FcgammaRII). A single amino acid substitution at
position 131 in FcgammaRIIa is critical in the binding of human IgG subclasses.
The hypothesis that the FcgammaRIIa-Arg/Arg131 genotype, which does not bind to
IgG2, is a host genetic factor for protection against high-density P. falciparum 
infection was tested. One hundred eighty-two infants from a large community-based
birth cohort study in western Kenya were selected for an unmatched case-control
study. Results showed that the infants with the FcgammaRIIa-Arg/Arg131 genotype
were significantly less likely to be at risk for high-density falciparum
infection, compared with infants with the FcgammaRIIa-His/Arg131 genotype
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.278; 95% confidence interval, 0.123-0.627; P=.0021). This
finding supports the hypothesis.
