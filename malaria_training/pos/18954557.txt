Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins play an
important role in cytokine signaling pathways and regulation of immune responses.
The balance of the phosphorylated (activated) STAT1 (pSTAT1) and STAT3 (pSTAT3)
has been documented in cancer immunology. In this study, we investigated the
dynamic balance of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 in C57BL/6 mice infected with either a
nonlethal (Py17XNL) or lethal (Py17XL) strain of Plasmodium yoelii. Both Py17XNL 
and Py17XL infections induced a maximum activation of STAT1 and STAT3 on the
first day after parasite inoculation. Additionally, the Py17XNL infection induced
a pSTAT1-dominant response in mice during the early stage of infection, with the 
resolution of parasitemia. In contrast, Py17XL infection induced a
pSTAT3-dominant response during the early phase of infection, with the death of
the animals. Our results indicated that maximum activation of STAT1 and STAT3
occurred much earlier than the peak levels of cytokines induced by Plasmodium
yoelii infection based on previous reports and that infection with Py17XNL and
Py17XL induced different dynamic patterns of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 balance.
