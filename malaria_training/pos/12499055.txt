The activity and levels of CaM kinase II-alpha was investigated in the cytosolic 
and membrane fraction of mice cerebral cortex and cerebellum using an
experimental model of fatal murine cerebral malaria (FMCM). In parallel,
Ca(2+)/Calmodulin dependent phosphorylation of target substrate proteins was
studied using syntide-2 as substrate. Pathology of FMCM resulted in decreased CaM
kinase-II activity in both cortex and cerebellum though western analysis revealed
no appreciable changes in the levels of CaM kinase-II alpha in cytosol and
membrane fractions from control and cerebral malaria infected brain. Given the
abundant expression of Cam kinase-II in neuronal tissue, its significance in
neurotransmitter release and synthesis and signal transduction during apoptosis, 
decreased levels of enzyme activity and altered phosphorylation of substrate
proteins by CaM kinase II may serve as important cues in understanding the CaM
kinase signal transduction events central to neurological disorders during FMCM.
