Plasmodium berghei infection impaired the hepatic heme synthesizing machinery of 
mice. Key enzymes, viz. S-aminolevulinic acid synthase, S-aminolevulinic acid
dehydrase and ferrochelatase were found to be decreased. In contrast, tryptophane
pyrrolase noticeably increased during parasitic infection. Oral feeding of
chloroquine [16 mg (kg body weight)-1 x 4 days] cleared the parasitaemia from
infected mice within 72 h and returned the altered levels of enzymes almost to
normal a week after cessation of treatment, the exception being tryptophane
pyrrolase, which remained unaffected. Chloroquine treatment did not cause any
significant alteration in the above-mentioned enzymes of normal mice.
