The aim of our study was to investigate the role of S180L polymorphism in
modulation of acquisition of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in a small
group of Pakistani population. A total of 133 individuals including 60 controls
and 73 patients of malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, were genotyped using
allele-specific PCR. Ninety-two samples successfully demonstrated the PCR
amplification results, while forty-one samples could not be genotyped due to
failure in PCR amplification. The allele frequency for S180L polymorphism was
deviant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the population under
observation. Association was found between the observed polymorphism and the
occurrence of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (p = 0.01). Chances of
malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum were low in CC genotype carriers in
comparison to other genotypes (Odds ratio: 0.3016; 95% CI: 0.124-0.729). The
present findings suggest that S180L polymorphism is important in modulating the
probability of acquisition of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in
Pakistani population. The CC genotype plays a protective role in local population
against this type of malaria.
