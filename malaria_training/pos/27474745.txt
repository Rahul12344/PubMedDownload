Cerebral malaria is a severe and often fatal complication of Plasmodium
falciparum infection. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, a breakdown 
of the blood-brain barrier, and a strong inflammation in the brain. We
investigated the role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), an important modulator
of neuroinflammatory responses, in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM).
Strikingly, mice with a deletion of the CB2-encoding gene (Cnr2(-/-)) inoculated 
with Plasmodium berghei ANKA erythrocytes exhibited enhanced survival and a
diminished blood-brain barrier disruption. Therapeutic application of a specific 
CB2 antagonist also conferred increased ECM resistance in wild type mice.
Hematopoietic derived immune cells were responsible for the enhanced protection
in bone marrow (BM) chimeric Cnr2(-/-) mice. Mixed BM chimeras further revealed
that CB2-expressing cells contributed to ECM development. A heterogeneous
CD11b(+) cell population, containing macrophages and neutrophils, expanded in the
Cnr2(-/-) spleen after infection and expressed macrophage mannose receptors,
arginase-1 activity, and IL-10. Also in the Cnr2(-/-) brain, CD11b(+) cells that 
expressed selected anti-inflammatory markers accumulated, and expression of
inflammatory mediators IFN-γ and TNF-α was reduced. Finally, the M2 macrophage
chemokine CCL17 was identified as an essential factor for enhanced survival in
the absence of CB2, because CCL17 × Cnr2 double-deficient mice were fully
susceptible to ECM. Thus, targeting CB2 may be promising for the development of
alternative treatment regimes of ECM.
