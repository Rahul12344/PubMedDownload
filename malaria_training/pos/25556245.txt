Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria is naturally acquired in individuals
living in malaria-endemic areas of Africa. Abs play a key role in mediating this 
immunity; however, the acquisition of the components of Ab immunity, long-lived
plasma cells and memory B cells (MBCs), is remarkably inefficient, requiring
years of malaria exposure. Although long-lived classical MBCs
(CD19(+)/CD20(+)/CD21(+)/CD27(+)/CD10(-)) are gradually acquired in response to
natural infection, exposure to P. falciparum also results in a large expansion of
what we have termed atypical MBCs (CD19(+)/CD20(+)/CD21(-)/CD27(-)/CD10(-)). At
present, the function of atypical MBCs in malaria is not known, nor are the
factors that drive their differentiation. To gain insight into the relationship
between classical and atypical IgG(+) MBCs, we compared the Ab H and L chain V
gene repertoires of children living in a malaria-endemic region in Mali. We found
that these repertoires were remarkably similar by a variety of criteria,
including V gene usage, rate of somatic hypermutation, and CDR-H3 length and
composition. The similarity in these repertoires suggests that classical MBCs and
atypical MBCs differentiate in response to similar Ag-dependent selective
pressures in malaria-exposed children and that atypical MBCs do not express a
unique V gene repertoire.
