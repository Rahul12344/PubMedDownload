The protozoan parasite Theileria parva infects and transforms bovine lymphocytes,
giving rise to a fatal lymphoproliferative condition known as East Coast fever.
Although immune cattle mount strong cytolytic T lymphocyte responses to the
parasite, naive animals appear unable to respond and develop severe
immunopathological lesions. We have investigated the patterns of cytokine mRNA
expressed by 19 bulk and cloned parasite-infected lymphoblast cell lines using a 
multiplex PCR system. Considerable variation was observed in the cytokine
profiles of these lines and only IL10 was universally expressed. Investigation of
cloned lines representing the major bovine lymphocyte populations failed to
reveal a lineage-specific pattern of cytokine mRNA expression that could be
associated with infection. Nonetheless, analysis of a CD4+ T cell clone before
and after transformation with the parasite indicated that infection does alter
the pattern of cytokine expression, with apparent upregulation of IL10. These
observations raise the possibility that IL10 derived from infected cells may
influence the immune responses of naive cattle to challenge.
