Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection in children is associated with
increased auto-antibody production, high IL-10 plasma levels and antibodies to
merozoite surface protein 3.

BACKGROUND: Mechanisms of acquired protection to malaria in asymptomatic
Plasmodium falciparum carriers are only partially understood. Among them, the
role plays by the self-reactive antibodies has not been clarified yet. In this
study, the relationship between repertoires of circulating self-reactive and
parasite-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), their correlation with cytokine levels,
and their association with protection against malaria was investigated in
asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum-infected Gabonese children.
METHODS: The diversity of P. falciparum-specific antibody repertoire was analysed
using a protein micro-array immunoassay, the total auto-antibody repertoire by
quantitative immunoblotting and circulating cytokine levels were measured by
ELISA in endemic controls (EC) and P. falciparum-infected children from Gabon
with asymptomatic (AM) or mild malaria (MM). The association of self- and
parasite-specific antibody repertoires with circulating cytokines was evaluated
using single linkage hierarchical clustering, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman's
rank correlation.
RESULTS: Children with AM exhibited an IgG response to merozoite surface protein 
3 (MSP3) but not to MSP1-19, although their levels of total P.
falciparum-specific IgG were similar to those in the MM group. Moreover, the
asymptomatic children had increased levels of autoantibodies recognising brain
antigens. In addition, a correlation between IL-10 levels and parasite load was
found in AM and MM children. These two groups also exhibited significant
correlations between plasma levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ with age and with total
plasma IgG levels. IL-10 and IFN-γ levels were also associated with auto-antibody
responses in AM.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results indicate that a self-reactive polyclonal
response associated with increased IgG to MSP3 and high plasma levels of IL-10
and IFN-γ may contribute to protective immune mechanisms triggered in
asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in Gabonese children.
