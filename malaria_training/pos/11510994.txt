Superoxide plays a crucial role in innate immunity to various pathogens. We
examined the role of superoxides in the transmission of malaria using gp91phox
knockout (X-CGD) mice that lack the ability to produce superoxide. Mosquitoes
that fed on X-CGD mice infected intraperitoneally with Plasmodium berghei NK65
ANKA formed more oocysts than did those that fed on control mice at any day after
infection. The number of oocysts peaked on day 5 post-infection in X-CGD and
control mice and then decreased significantly after day 5 post-infection.
However, on day 7 post-infection, the infectivity of gametocytes in X-CGD mice
was significantly higher than that in control mice. These results show that two
pathways, superoxide-dependent and -independent, are involved in the host systems
regulating the transmission of malaria and inhibiting gametocyte development.
