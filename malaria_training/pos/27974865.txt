Malaria is a serious disease, caused by the parasite of the genus Plasmodium,
which was responsible for 440,000 deaths in 2015. Acute lung injury/acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is one of the main clinical
complications in severe malaria. The murine model DBA/2 reproduces the clinical
signs of ALI/ARDS in humans, when infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. High
levels of HO-1 were reported in cases of severe malaria. Our data indicated that 
the HO-1 mRNA and protein expression are increased in mice that develop
malaria-associated ALI/ARDS (MA-ALI/ARDS). Additionally, the hemin, a HO-1
inducing drug, prevented mice from developing MA-ALI/ARDS when administered prior
to the development of MA-ALI/ARDS in this model. Also, hemin treatment showed an 
amelioration of respiratory parameters in mice, high VEGF levels in the sera, and
a decrease in vascular permeability in the lung, which are signs of ALI/ARDS.
Therefore, the induction of HO-1 before the development of MA-ALI/ARDS could be
protective. However, the increased expression of HO-1 on the onset of MA-ALI/ARDS
development may represent an effort to revert the phenotype of this syndrome by
the host. We therefore confirm that HO-1 inducing drugs could be used for
prevention of MA-ALI/ARDS in humans.
