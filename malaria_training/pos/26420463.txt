Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity and in 
pathogenesis during the blood stage of malaria infection. The mechanisms
underlying DC homeostasis during malaria infection are not well understood. In
this study, the numbers of conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in
the spleens after lethal rodent malaria infection were examined, and were found
to be significantly reduced. Concomitant with up-regulation of
maturation-associated molecules, activation of caspase-3 was significantly
increased, suggesting induction of cell death. Studies using neutralizing
antibody and gene-deficient mice showed that type I and II interferons were
critically involved in activation induced cell death of cDCs during malaria
infection. These results demonstrate that DCs rapidly disappeared following
IFN-mediated DC activation, and that homeostasis of DCs was significantly
impaired during malaria infection.
