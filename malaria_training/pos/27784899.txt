correlates with severity and expression of EPCR-binding PfEMP1.

The pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria involves a complex interplay
between parasite adhesion and inflammatory response that includes release of
cytokines and activation of the endothelium with accompanying release of
Angiopoitin 2 (Ang2) to the plasma. A-disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17
(ADAM17) is a protein responsible for releasing cytokines, including Tumor
Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), and shedding of adhesion proteins. In this study, we
show that plasma levels of ADAM17 are increased in Tanzanian children
hospitalized with a malaria infection compared with asymptomatic children but
similar to children hospitalized with other infectious diseases. The plasma
levels of ADAM17 decreased during recovery after an acute malaria episode. Plasma
levels of Ang2 were associated with markers of malaria severity and levels of var
transcripts encoding P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1)
containing Cysteine Rich Inter Domain Region α1 (CIDRα1) domains predicted to
bind Endothelial Protein C receptor (EPCR). ADAM17 levels were not associated
with expression of var genes encoding different PfEMP1 types when controlling for
age. These data are the first to report ADAM17 plasma levels in malaria-exposed
individuals, and support the notion that parasite sequestration mediated by
EPCR-binding PfEMP1 is associated with endothelial activation and pathology in
severe paediatric malaria.
