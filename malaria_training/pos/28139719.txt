Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum
infection. This encephalopathy is characterized by coma and is thought to result 
from mechanical microvessel obstruction and an excessive activation of immune
cells leading to pathological inflammation and blood-brain barrier alterations.
IL-22 contributes to both chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, and may
have protective or pathogenic effects, depending on the tissue and disease state.
We evaluated whether polymorphisms (n = 46) of IL22 and IL22RA2 were associated
with CM in children from Nigeria and Mali. Two SNPs of IL22, rs1012356
(P = 0.016, OR = 2.12) and rs2227476 (P = 0.007, OR = 2.08) were independently
associated with CM in a sample of 115 Nigerian children with CM and 160 controls.
The association with rs2227476 (P = 0.01) was replicated in 240 nuclear families 
with one affected child from Mali. SNP rs2227473, in linkage disequilibrium with 
rs2227476, was also associated with CM in the combined cohort for these two
populations, (P = 0.004, OR = 1.55). SNP rs2227473 is located within a putative
binding site for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a master regulator of IL-22
production. Individuals carrying the aggravating T allele of rs2227473 produced
significantly more IL-22 than those without this allele. Overall, these findings 
suggest that IL-22 is involved in the pathogenesis of CM.
