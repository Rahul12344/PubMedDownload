Almost all individuals (182) belonging to an Amazonian riverine population
(Portuchuelo, RO, Brazil) were investigated for ascertaining data on
epidemiological aspects of malaria. Thirteen genetic blood polymorphisms were
investigated (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Kell, and Duffy systems, haptoglobins, hemoglobins, 
and the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase,
phosphoglucomutase, carbonic anhydrase, red cell acid phosphatase, and esterase
D). The results indicated that the Duffy system is associated with susceptibility
to malaria, as observed in other endemic areas. Moreover, suggestions also arose 
indicating that the EsD and Rh loci may be significantly associated with
resistance to malaria. If statistical type II errors and sample stratification
could be ruled out, hypotheses on the existence of a causal mechanism or an
unknown closely linked locus involved in susceptibility to malaria infection may 
explain the present findings.
