An obligatory step of malaria parasite infection is Plasmodium sporozoite
invasion of host hepatocytes, and host lipoprotein clearance pathways have been
linked to Plasmodium liver infection. By using RNA interference to screen
lipoprotein-related host factors, we show here that the class B, type I scavenger
receptor (SR-BI) is the strongest regulator of Plasmodium infection among these
factors. Inhibition of SR-BI function reduced P. berghei infection in Huh7 cells,
and overexpression of SR-BI led to increased infection. In vivo silencing of
liver SR-BI expression in mice and inhibition of SR-BI activity in human primary 
hepatocytes reduced infection by P. berghei and by P. falciparum, respectively.
Heterozygous SR-BI(+/-) mice displayed reduced P. berghei infection rates
correlating with liver SR-BI expression levels. Additional analyses revealed that
SR-BI plays a dual role in Plasmodium infection, affecting both sporozoite
invasion and intracellular parasite development, and may therefore constitute a
good target for malaria prophylaxis.
