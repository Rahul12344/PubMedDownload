To investigate effects of Babesia infection on drug metabolism, we
intraperitoneally inoculated B. microti into ICR mice and measured the expression
and activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, a major drug-metabolizing
enzyme. Twelve days after infection, CYP3A11 mRNA, CYP3A protein and activity and
mRNAs of nuclear receptors, which participate in CYP3A expression, were
significantly reduced. These results suggest that B. microti infection suppresses
CYP3A-dependent drug metabolism. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 mRNAs were induced in the infected mouse liver.
Since TNF-α is one of the potent mediators that induce NOS2 and repress CYP3A
transcription, the possible involvement of TNF-α in this downregulation of CYP3A 
was discussed.
