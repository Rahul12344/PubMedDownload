The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the parasitophorous vacuolar
membrane in Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes are incompletely
understood, and the protein composition of this membrane is still enigmatic.
Although the differentiated mammalian erythrocyte lacks the machinery required
for endocytosis, some reports have described a localisation of host cell membrane
proteins at the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane. Aquaporin 3 is an abundant
plasma membrane protein of various cells, including mammalian erythrocytes where 
it is found in distinct oligomeric states. Here we show that human aquaporin 3 is
internalized into infected erythrocytes, presumably during or soon after
invasion. It is integrated into the PVM where it is organized in novel oligomeric
states which are not found in non-infected cells.
