Severe malaria represents a clinical spectrum of disease. We propose that innate 
immune inflammatory responses to malaria play key roles in the pathogenesis and
clinical outcomes of distinct severe malaria syndromes. To investigate this
hypothesis, mice deficient in IRAK4, central to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated
signaling, were studied in two experimental models of malaria: Plasmodium berghei
(PbA) and Plasmodium chabaudi (PccAS). Irak4(-/-)mice had decreased
pro-inflammatory cytokine production during infection in both models. However,
animals were relatively protected from PbA-associated symptoms compared with
wild-type mice, whereas Irak4(-/-) animals were more susceptible to
PccAS-associated disease. These results show that IRAK4-mediated innate immune
inflammatory responses play critical roles in divergent clinical outcomes in
murine malaria models. As such, integrated approaches, using more than one model,
are required to fully understand the parasite/host interactions that characterize
severe malaria, and more importantly, to fully assess the effect of adjunctive
therapies targeting innate immune responses to malaria.
