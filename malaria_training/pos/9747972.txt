Theileria parasitises bovine leukocytes and transforms them into proliferating,
metastatic tumours, where the infection resembles a leukaemia-like disease. We
have studied the signal transduction pathways leading to activation of the
transcription factor AP-1 in different transformed leukocytes. Parasite infection
leads to an up-regulation of all members of the Jun/Fos family of proteins and
surprisingly, this occurs in the absence of any detectable ERK, or p38 MAP kinase
activity. In the parasitised B-sarcoma TBL3, AP-1 induction occurs in the absence
of any JNK activity. In contrast, in infected macrophage and B-cell lines, AP-1
transcriptional activity is strictly associated with the parasite-induced
constitutive activation of JNK and subsequent c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation.
Thus, constant AP-1 transcriptional activity involves both an upregulation in the
levels of Jun and Fos proteins and constitutive JNK activation.
