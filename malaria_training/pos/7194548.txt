Acute Babesia bovis infections: plasma creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and
creatinine levels and associated muscle damage.

Wright IG, McKenna RV, Goodger BV.

Two groups of five two-year-old Hereford steers were infected with two virulent
strains of B. bovis. The plasma concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine rose early in infection and showed highly
significant increases terminally. Extensive skeletal muscle degeneration was
observed terminally as was degeneration of myocardium, although this was much
less extensive. Terminal clinical signs included posterior muscle wasting,
weakness, and recumbency. It was concluded that the extensive changes to muscle
and to CK and LDH were caused by anoxia due primarily to shock and stasis of the 
circulation induced by the parasites.
