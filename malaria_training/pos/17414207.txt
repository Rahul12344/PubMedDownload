PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malaria represents one of the most important selective factors
affecting human populations. Several inherited diseases of red blood cells lead
to resistance at the erythrocytic stage. Among patients who experience hereditary
elliptocytosis related to mutations of erythrocyte membrane proteins, molecular
studies have shown the prevalence of particular spectrin mutations in patients
from black ethnic extraction, leading one to question the selection of new
malaria-resistant genes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective epidemiological and molecular studies in West Africa
have confirmed the prevalence (between 0.6 and 1.6%) of particular spectrin
mutations related to hereditary elliptocytosis. These studies have also revealed 
the frequency of alpha-spectrin chain polymorphisms, associated in cis with
elliptocytogenic spectrin mutations and defining particular spectrin allele
haplotypes. Culture studies of Plasmodium falciparum in elliptocytes bearing such
elliptocytogenic alleles of spectrin showed that these alleles are supplementary 
genetic factors of malaria resistance in vitro.
SUMMARY: Certain instances of spectrin mutations or polymorphisms have not yet
been shown to constitute new factors of innate resistance to malaria in vivo.
Epidemiological surveys of hereditary elliptocytosis and parasite culture
studies, however, have argued that the relationships between parasite and
spectrin-based skeleton should be examined more closely and the molecular
interactions between parasite ligands and particular spectrin chain domains
should be characterized.
