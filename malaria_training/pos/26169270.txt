Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are key players in the induction and regulation
of immune responses. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, determination of which
cells and pathways are activated in the network of APCs remains elusive. We
therefore investigated the effects of a controlled human malaria infection in
healthy, malaria-naive volunteers on the subset composition and activation status
of dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes. While subsets of monocytes increased in
frequency during blood-stage infection, DC frequencies remained largely stable.
Activation markers classically associated with peptide presentation to and
priming of αβT cells, HLA-DR and CD86, were upregulated in monocytes and
inflammatory CD16 myeloid DCs (mDCs) but not in the classical CD1c, BDCA2, or
BDCA3 DC subsets. In addition, these activated APC subsets showed increased
expression of CD1c, which is involved in glycolipid antigen presentation, and of 
the immune complex binding Fcγ receptor III (CD16). Our data show that P.
falciparum asexual parasites do not activate classical DC subsets but instead
activate mainly monocytes and inflammatory CD16 mDCs and appear to prime
alternative activation pathways via induction of CD16 and/or CD1c. Changes in
expression of these surface molecules might increase antigen capture and enhance 
glycolipid antigen presentation in addition to the classical major
histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) peptide presentation and thereby
contribute to the initiation of T-cell responses in malaria. (This study has been
registered at Clinicaltrials.gov under registration no. NCT01086917.).
