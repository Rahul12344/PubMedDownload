CD47 engagement by the macrophage signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)
inhibits phagocytic activity and protects red blood cells (RBCs) from
erythrophagocytosis. The role of CD47-SIRPα in the innate immune response to
Plasmodium falciparum infection is unknown. We hypothesized that disruption of
SIRPα signaling may enhance macrophage uptake of malaria parasite-infected RBCs. 
To test this hypothesis, we examined in vivo clearance in CD47-deficient mice
infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and in vitro phagocytosis of P.
falciparum-infected RBCs by macrophages from SHP-1-deficient (Shp-1(-/-)) mice
and NOD.NOR-Idd13.Prkdc(scid) (NS-Idd13) mice, as well as human macrophages,
following disruption of CD47-SIRPα interactions with anti-SIRPα antibodies or
recombinant SIRPα-Fc fusion protein. Compared to their wild-type counterparts,
Cd47(-/-) mice displayed significantly lower parasitemia, decreased endothelial
activation, and enhanced survival. Using macrophages from SHP-1-deficient mice or
from NS-Idd13 mice, which express a SIRPα variant that does not bind human CD47, 
we showed that altered SIRPα signaling resulted in enhanced phagocytosis of P.
falciparum-infected RBCs. Moreover, disrupting CD47-SIRPα engagement using
anti-SIRPα antibodies or SIRPα-Fc fusion protein also increased phagocytosis of
P. falciparum-infected RBCs. These results indicate an important role for
CD47-SIRPα interactions in innate control of malaria and suggest novel targets
for intervention.
