The extent of liver and kidney damage in 10 young steers, infected with a
stabilate of Theileria annulata, was estimated by the determination of enzymes
(GOT, GPT, SDH, ALD), serum levels of bilirubin and urea. At the same time the
effectiveness of some liver protecting medical agents was tested. The following
results were obtained: Change in the activity of the enzymes GOT, SDH and ALD and
the increase of bilirubin during the advanced course of the disease are
indicative of severe tissue damage in the liver. The levels of urea were found to
be in the normal range with only a few exceptions. This seems to exclude the
involvement of the kidney in the disease. The group of animals receiving liver
protecting medication did not show any difference compared with those animals
without medication.
