Concentration and enzyme content of in vitro-cultured Babesia bigemina-infected
erythrocytes.

Vega CA, Buening GM, Rodriguez SD, Carson CA.

Clones of in vitro-cultured Babesia bigemina-infected erythrocytes were
concentrated by several density gradient procedures. The density range of
infected erythrocytes containing pairs of parasites was 1.077 to 1.089 g/ml,
whereas the density range of infected erythrocytes containing single parasites
was 1.092 to 1.100 g/ml. Three enzymes--lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-phosphate 
isomerase, and glutamate dehydrogenase--were found associated with infected
erythrocytes. The parasite-specific enzyme and/or isoenzymes were shown to have
different mobility patterns in starch gel electrophoresis from those found in the
normal bovine erythrocytes. The enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was not
detected as a parasite-specific enzyme in B. bigemina-infected erythrocytes.
