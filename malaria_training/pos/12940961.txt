The innate immune response to Babesia bovis infection in cattle is age-related,
spleen-dependent and, in stabilate inoculated calves, has type-1 characteristics,
including the early induction of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. In this study with three
calves, parameters of innate immunity were followed for 2 weeks after tick
transmission of B. bovis. Each calf survived the acute disease episode without
drug intervention, and responded with increased levels of plasma interferon-gamma
and type-1 cytokine expression, monocyte/macrophage activation, and CD8+ cellular
proliferation in the spleen. The proliferating CD8+ population consisted
primarily of NK-like cells, and the expansion occurred in parallel with an
increase in IL-15 mRNA expression in the spleen.
