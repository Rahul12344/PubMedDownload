Theileria parva (T. parva) causes East Coast fever (ECF), which is of huge
economic importance to Eastern and Southern African countries. In a previous
bovine model, inflammatory cytokines were closely associated with disease
progression in animals experimentally infected with T. parva. The African Cape
buffalo (Syncerus caffer), the natural reservoir for T. parva, is completely
resistant to ECF despite a persistently high parasitaemia following infection
with T. parva. Characterizing basic immunological interactions in the host is
critical to understanding the mechanism underlying disease resistance in the
African Cape buffalo. In this study, the expression level of several cytokines
was analyzed in T. parva-infected buffaloes. There were no significant
differences in the expression profiles of inflammatory cytokines between the
infected and uninfected animals despite a remarkably high parasitaemia in the
former. However, the expression level of IL-10 was significantly upregulated in
the infected animals. These results indicate a correlation between diminished
inflammatory cytokines response and disease resistance in the buffalo.
