Resistance to falciparum malaria among adults in central Sudan.

Bayoumi RA, Bashir AH, Abdulhadi NH.

Adults claiming resistance to malaria were identified in the Sennar region of
central Sudan, where P. falciparum is hyperendemic but seasonal in transmission. 
Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers of sera from these individuals were
comparable to those of malaria patients with positive blood films, indicating
equal exposure, while in vitro antiparasitic activity of their sera tended to be 
higher, indicating an effective immunological response to falciparum malaria.
Hemoglobin S (Hb S) was significantly more prevalent in adults resistant to
malaria. This trait offers protection at the erythrocyte level and it is also
possible that it could enhance the ability of carrier adults to acquire
protective immunity. Erythrocyte 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase A (PGDA) and
phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), phenotypes of unknown relevance to protection
against falciparum malaria, were also significantly more prevalent in those
claiming resistance to malaria. A trend of higher prevalence for erythrocyte
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD-), Kell (+) and transferrin D 
(TfD) was detected among resistant individuals and higher KP(a+) and P2 among
malaria patients, but the numbers evaluated in this study did not allow
determination of statistical significance. No association was found with
erythrocyte glyoxalases, ABO and Duffy blood groups and serum haptoglobins.
