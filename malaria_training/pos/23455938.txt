Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum in
humans and major cause of death. SP600125 is a specific, small molecule inhibitor
of JNK that prevents the phosphorylation of c-Jun and blocks the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines and attenuates neuronal apoptosis in several
neurodegenerative disorders. We evaluated the effect of SP600125 treatment on the
survival of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected C57BL/6J mice. Administration 
of SP600125 improved survival in PbA-infected C57BL6J mice but has no effect on
parasitemia. Further, SP600125 administration resulted in attenuation of neuronal
cell death along with inhibition of proinflammatory mediators TNF-Î± and COX-2 and
proapoptotic mediators p-c-Jun and active caspase 3 in PbA-infected mice. The
promising findings of this study make SP600125 a potential agent for supportive
therapy to alleviate inflammation and neuronal cell death associated with CM.
