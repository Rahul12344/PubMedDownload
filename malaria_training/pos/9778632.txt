After infection with sporozoites of the protozoon Theileria parva (Tp) bovine T
cells are readily transformed to permanent growth in vivo and in vitro. Their
transformed state depends on the constant presence of the parasite but membrane
signals remain important. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in
the transduction of membrane signals in haematopoietic cells. We have
investigated Src-family kinases in bovine T cells transformed by Tp. The T cell
receptor-associated tyrosine kinase p60fyn had high activity in all cell lines
tested. In addition, weak phosphorylation of 2 novel bands was observed
associated with Fyn. In contrast to Fyn, enzymatic activity of p56lck, which in T
cells has an essential role in signalling, was low. Furthermore, 1 of 3 Tp
transformed cell lines was completely devoid of p56lck indicating that the enzyme
is not necessary for the Tp dependent growth of the T cells. In addition to
p60fyn and p56lck weak enzymatic activity of 1 splice variant of p53/56lyn was
observed after infection of T cells with Tp. These data show that growth
transformation by Tp influences kinase activity in bovine T cells. However, they 
also prove that p56lck does not play an essential role in the transformation
mechanism.
