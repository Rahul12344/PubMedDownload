Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell
pathways and hijack their genetic and epigenetic machinery to change host cell
phenotypic states. Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular
parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus
that transforms its mammalian host cells. Theileria infection of bovine
leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with
activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed
phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone. We
used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and
modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide 
prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7,
leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes 
transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo
zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited 
by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is
mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved
mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to
manipulate host oncogenic signalling.
