The levels of coagulation factors II + VII + X and of blood platelets
(thrombocytes) as well as of cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors were
studied in the patients with malaria or meningococcal infections. The coagulation
factors were decreased particularly in the meningococcal patients, while
thrombocytes were lowest in the Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients. There was
no correlation between factors II + VII + X and thrombocytes, but plasma levels
of coagulation factors II + VII + X were found to correlate inversely with levels
of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and soluble tumour necrosis factor-I
(sTNF-RI) in patients with malaria and meningococcal infections. Elevated sIL-2R 
and sTNF-RI levels and decreased coagulation factors reverted to normal within
3-5 days after initiation of therapy in P. falciparum patients followed
consecutively. Estimation of coagulation factors may be used to monitor the
course of these common and potentially life-threatening infections.
