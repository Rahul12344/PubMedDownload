Infection of erythrocytes by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum results
in the export of several parasite proteins into the erythrocyte cytoplasm
establishing novel interactions between host and parasite proteins, particularly 
at the membrane skeleton that modifies both the structural and functional
properties of the red cell. We present evidences that two members of the P.
falciparum acyl-CoA synthetase (PfACS) family, responsible for the activation of 
long-chain fatty acids by thio-esterification with CoA, are transported in
vesicle-like structures toward the host erythrocyte cytoplasm where they interact
with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin. Carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) overlay
studies indicated that PfACS1 and PfACS3 bind to the 78-kDa fragment of ankyrin
corresponding with its spectrin-binding domain. Co-immunoprecipitation of ankyrin
and PfACS1/3 indicates that at least a fraction of these proteins are physically 
associated in the infected erythrocytes and provide evidence for a novel specific
interaction which suggest that such a binding may bring these enzymes closer to
the host erythrocyte membrane where exogenous fatty acids are available.
