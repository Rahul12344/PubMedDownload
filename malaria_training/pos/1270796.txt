Changes in C3 metabolism during protozoan infection (Babesia rodhaini) in rats.

Chapman WE, Ward PA.

Metabolism of the third component of complement (C3) and IgG was measured in rats
before and during infection with the hemosporidium agent Babesia rodhaina. In the
course of infection, hypocomplementemia and immune complex nephritis developed.
During babesial infection, in most animals the half-life of C3 fell sharply, as
did serum levels of C3; the catabolic rate for C3 sharply increased, whereas the 
synthetic rate sharply decreased. In contrast, the catabolic rate for IgG
remained unchanged. The alteration in the metabolism of C3 in the face of
nonparallel changes in IgG metabolism suggests that abnormal glomerular
filtration and increased vasopermeability cannot explain the findings. Babesial
infection in the rat provides a useful model for the study of acquired C3
metabolic defects that have been observed in humans with immune complex diseases.
