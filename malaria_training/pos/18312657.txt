BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy is characterized by the sequestration of
malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBC) in the intervillous spaces of the
placenta, often accompanied by the infiltration of maternal mononuclear cells,
causing substantial maternal and foetal/infant morbidity. The iRBC bind to
receptors expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast (ST). How ST responds to this
interaction remains poorly understood. Because it is known that ST is
immunoactive and can respond to infectious agents, the consequences of this
ST-iRBC interaction should be investigated.
METHODS: An in vitro system was used to assess the biochemical and immunological 
changes induced in ST by ST-adherent iRBCs. Changes in ST mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) activation were assessed by immunoblotting and mRNA
expression levels of selected cytokine and chemokines in primary ST bound by iRBC
were determined using real-time, reverse transcription PCR. In addition, secreted
cytokine and chemokine proteins were assayed by standard ELISA, and chemotaxis of
PBMC was assessed using a two-chamber assay system.
RESULTS: Following iRBC/ST interaction, ST C-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) was
activated and modest increases in the mRNA expression of TGF-beta and IL-8/CXCL8 
were observed. In addition, this interaction increased secretion of MIF and
MIP-1alpha/CCL3 by ST and induced migration of PBMC towards iRBC-stimulated ST.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study provide the first evidence that ST
participates in shaping the local immunological milieu and in the recruitment of 
maternal immune cells to the maternal blood space during placental malaria
infection.
