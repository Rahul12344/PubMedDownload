Plasmodium vivax merozoites only invade reticulocytes, a minor though
heterogeneous population of red blood cell precursors that can be graded by
levels of transferrin receptor (CD71) expression. The development of a protocol
that allows sorting reticulocytes into defined developmental stages and a robust 
ex vivo P vivax invasion assay has made it possible for the first time to
investigate the fine-scale invasion preference of P vivax merozoites.
Surprisingly, it was the immature reticulocytes (CD71(+)) that are generally
restricted to the bone marrow that were preferentially invaded, whereas older
reticulocytes (CD71(-)), principally found in the peripheral blood, were rarely
invaded. Invasion assays based on the CD71(+) reticulocyte fraction revealed
substantial postinvasion modification. Thus, 3 to 6 hours after invasion, the
initially biomechanically rigid CD71(+) reticulocytes convert into a highly
deformable CD71(-) infected red blood cell devoid of host reticular matter, a
process that normally spans 24 hours for uninfected reticulocytes. Concurrent
with these changes, clathrin pits disappear by 3 hours postinvasion, replaced by 
distinctive caveolae nanostructures. These 2 hitherto unsuspected features of P
vivax invasion, a narrow preference for immature reticulocytes and a rapid
remodeling of the host cell, provide important insights pertinent to the
pathobiology of the P vivax infection.
