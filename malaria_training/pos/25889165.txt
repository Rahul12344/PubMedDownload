BACKGROUND: The underlying causes of severe malarial anaemia are multifactorial. 
In previously reports, Plasmodium vivax was found to be able to directly
inhibited erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation. The molecular
mechanisms underlying the suppression of erythropoiesis by P. vivax are
remarkably complex and remain unclear. In this study, a phosphoproteomic approach
was performed to dissect the molecular mechanism of phosphoprotein regulation,
which is involved in the inhibitory effect of parasites on erythroid cell
development.
METHODS: This study describes the first comparative phosphoproteome analysis of
growing erythroid cells (gECs), derived from human haematopoietic stem cells,
exposed to lysates of infected erythrocytes (IE)/uninfected erythrocytes (UE) for
24, 48 and 72 h. This study utilized IMAC phosphoprotein isolation directly
coupled with LC MS/MS analysis.
RESULTS: Lysed IE significantly inhibited gEC growth at 48 and 72 h and cell
division resulting in the accumulation of cells in G0 phase. The relative levels 
of forty four phosphoproteins were determined from gECs exposed to IE/UE for
24-72 h and compared with the media control using the label-free quantitation
technique. Interestingly, the levels of three phosphoproteins: ezrin, alpha
actinin-1, and Rho kinase were significantly (p < 0.05) altered. These proteins
display interactions and are involved in the regulation of the cellular
cytoskeleton. Particularly affected was ezrin (phosphorylated at Thr567), which
is normally localized to gEC cell extension peripheral processes. Following
exposure to IE, for 48-72 h, the ezrin signal intensity was weak or absent. This 
result suggests that phospho-ezrin is important for actin cytoskeleton regulation
during erythroid cell growth and division.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that parasite proteins are able to inhibit
erythroid cell growth by down-regulation of ezrin phosphorylation, leading to
ineffective erythropoiesis ultimately resulting in severe malarial anaemia. A
better understanding of the mechanisms of ineffective erythropoiesis may be
beneficial in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent severe
malarial anaemia.
