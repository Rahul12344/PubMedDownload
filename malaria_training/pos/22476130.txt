Recent evidences have demonstrated the importance of Th17 cells in host defense
against infectious diseases. However, little is known about their role in
parasitic infections. Here, we showed that uncomplicated acute vivax malaria
induce a significant expansion of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells associated to a 
pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Furthermore, we demonstrated a correlation
between numbers of IL-17(+)CD4(+) T cells and circulating CD4(+) T-cells
producing IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β. Finally, correlations between number of these
cells and morbidity or parasitemia were not detected. Further studies are
underway to investigate whether IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells are critically
involved in the immunity against Plasmodium vivax infection.
