Serum transcobalamin II (TCII) levels were determined in 56 patients with P.
falciparum malaria infection. They were divided into 3 groups: severe (malarial
parasite > 5% or patients with cerebral malaria or renal insufficiency), moderate
(1-5% infection without complications) and mild (1% infection). Elevated serum
TCII values were found only in patients with severe malaria infection. These
values correlated directly with parasitemia, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, 
but were not correlated with alkaline phosphatase. As 17 patients with azotemia
had elevated serum TCII levels while other 3 patients with normal BUN and
creatinine concentrations had serum TCII levels within the normal limits. These
findings indicated that malarial patients with renal insufficiency had increased 
serum TCII. A possible mechanism is the reduced TCII-B12 that filtered through
the glomeruli due to the reduced renal blood flow with the decreased its uptake
by proximal tubular cells resulting in the decreased degradation of TCII by the
tubular lysosomal enzymes. Determination of serum TCII level may be used as an
indicator of renal function in malarial patients with renal insufficiency.
