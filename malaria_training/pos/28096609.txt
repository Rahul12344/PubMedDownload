AIM: The aim was to determine hemato-biochemical alterations and to determine the
better treatment of theileriosis in naturally infected calves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 74 Holstein crossbred calves below 6 months of 
age, of either sex were included for present investigation in Bikaner. Based on
the clinical examinations and laboratory results, 20 calves included for
hemato-biochemical studies (before and after treatment) and divided into two
groups (having 10 calves each).
RESULTS: The clinical examination of these calves revealed weakness, ticks
infestations, high fever above 104Â°F, pronounced swelling of prescapular,
prefemoral, parotid lymph nodes, loss of elasticity of skin, anemia, lacrimal
discharges, pulpy cornea, tachycardia, and dyspnea. There was highly significant 
decrease (p<0.01) in hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume and 
total leukocyte count, serum glucose, total protein, globulin and albumin level
and highly significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase level as compared to healthy control animals in Group I and II. 
The animals of Group II treated with buparvaquone along with single blood
transfusion shows better recovery then animals of Group I treated with bupavaqone
and hematinic.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes were found in hemato-biochemical parameters in
theileria affected calves before treatment as compare to healthy control calves. 
Significant improvement was observed in hemato-biochemical parameters in
buparvaquone and single blood transfusion treated calves as compare to another
group, so it is concluded that buparvaquone and single blood transfusion is
better combination for treatment of theileriosis.
