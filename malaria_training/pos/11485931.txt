We explored the role of CD40-CD40L (CD154) in the severe malaria elicited by
Plasmodium berghei anka infection in mice. Mortality was >90% by day 8 after
infection in +/+ mice, but markedly decreased in CD40-/- or in CD40L-/- mice, as 
well as in +/+ mice treated with anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody. Parasitemia was 
similar in the different conditions. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier was
evident in infected +/+, but not in CD40-/- mice. Thrombocytopenia was less
severe in CD40-/- mice than in the +/+ controls. Sequestration of macrophages in 
brain venules and alveolar capillaries was reduced in CD40-/- or in CD40L-/-
mice, whereas sequestration of parasitized red blood cells or polymorphonuclear
leukocytes in alveolar capillaries was CD40-CD40L-independent. CD40 mRNA was
increased in the brain and lung of infected mice whereas CD40L was increased in
the lung. Tumor necrosis factor plasma levels were similarly increased in
infected +/+ or CD40-/- mice. Expression of CD54 and its mRNA levels in the brain
were moderately decreased in CD40-deficient mice. Thus the mortality associated
with severe malaria requires CD40-CD40L interaction that contributes to the
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, macrophage sequestration, and platelet
consumption.
