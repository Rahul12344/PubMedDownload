Disease tolerance is a defense strategy that limits the fitness costs of
infection irrespectively of pathogen burden. While restricting iron (Fe)
availability to pathogens is perceived as a host defense strategy, the resulting 
tissue Fe overload can be cytotoxic and promote tissue damage to exacerbate
disease severity. Examining this interplay during malaria, the disease caused by 
Plasmodium infection, we find that expression of the Fe sequestering protein
ferritin H chain (FtH) in mice, and ferritin in humans, is associated with
reduced tissue damage irrespectively of pathogen burden. FtH protection relies on
its ferroxidase activity, which prevents labile Fe from sustaining proapoptotic
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. FtH expression is inhibited by JNK
activation, promoting tissue Fe overload, tissue damage, and malaria severity.
Mimicking FtH's antioxidant effect or inhibiting JNK activation pharmacologically
confers therapeutic tolerance to malaria in mice. Thus, FtH provides metabolic
adaptation to tissue Fe overload, conferring tolerance to malaria.
