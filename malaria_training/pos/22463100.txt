BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signalling is reported to be primed by the
infection of human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. However, little is
known about the regulation of macrophages TLR signalling by the infection of
lethal or non-lethal strain of rodent malaria parasites.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were infected with non-lethal strain Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL
or lethal strain P. yoelii 17XL. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated to study
its immune response to pRBC lysate, and TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9) agonists, and
the expression of TLRs and intracellular signalling molecules were also
investigated by flow cytometry and semi-quantitive RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The reactivity of peritoneal macrophages from the mice infected with
lethal strain P. y 17XL or non-lethal strain P. y 17XNL were enhanced to pRBC
lysate, and TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 agonists at one, three and five days
post-infection. Of all the tested TLRs, only TLR2 was up-regulated on peritoneal 
macrophages of mice infected with either strain. However, transcription of
intracellular signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 was significantly
up-regulated in peritoneal macrophages from mice infected either with P. yoelii
17XL or P. yoelii 17XNL at one, three and five days post-infection. However, the 
enhanced TLRs response of macrophage from P. yoelii 17XNL-infected mice persisted
for a much longer time than that from P. yoelii 17XL-infected mice.
CONCLUSION: Both P. yoelii 17XL and 17XNL strains could enhance the response of
peritoneal macrophages to pRBC lysate and TLR agonists, through up-regulating the
expression of TLR2 and intracellular signalling molecules MyD88, IRAK-1, and
TRAF-6. In addition, prolonged high response of macrophage from P. yoelii
17XNL-infected mice might be associated with the more efficiently controlling of 
P. yoelii 17XNL growth in mice at early stage.
