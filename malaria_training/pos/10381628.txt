The serine protease inhibitor N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK) can interfere with cell-cycle progression and has also been shown either
to protect cells from apoptosis or to induce apoptosis. We tested the effect of
TPCK on two transformed T-cell lines. Both Jurkat T-cells and Theileria
parva-transformed T-cells were shown to be highly sensitive to TPCK-induced
growth arrest and apoptosis. Surprisingly, we found that the thiol antioxidant,
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as well as L- or D-cysteine blocked TPCK-induced growth
arrest and apoptosis. TPCK inhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activation in T.
parva-transformed T-cells, with phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta
being inhibited with different kinetics. TPCK-mediated inhibition of IkappaB
phosphorylation, NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activity were also
prevented by NAC or cysteine. Our observations indicate that apoptosis and
NF-kappaB inhibition induced by TPCK result from modifications of sulphydryl
groups on proteins involved in regulating cell survival and the NF-kappaB
activation pathway(s).
