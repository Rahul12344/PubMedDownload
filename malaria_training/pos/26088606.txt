BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is central to the immune response to
Plasmodium infection. Its plasma concentration is influenced by allele variants
in the promoter region of TNF. The study's objectives were to assess TNF allele
variants (TNF(-1031), TNF(-308)): (1) modulation of malaria rates in young
Tanzanian children; (2) modulation of the severity of malaria as indicated by
haemoglobin concentrations at the time of presentation with febrile episodes; and
(3) the association between Plasmodium infection and haemoglobin concentration in
symptomless parasite carriers.
METHODS: Data from a placebo-controlled trial in which 612 Tanzanian children
aged 6-60 months with height-for-age z-score in the range -3 SD to 1.5 SD was
utilised. Those with Plasmodium infection at baseline were treated with
artemether-lumefantrine. An episode of malaria was predefined as current
Plasmodium infection with an inflammatory response (axillary temperature ≥37.5°C 
or whole blood C-reactive protein concentration ≥8 mg/L) in children reported
sick. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern assessment as well as haplotype
analysis was conducted using HAPLOVIEW. Cox regression models used in the primary
analysis accounted for multiple episodes per child.
RESULTS: Genotyping of 94.9% (581/612) children for TNF(-1031) (TNF(-1031)T>C);
allele frequency was 0.39. Corresponding values for rs1800629 (TNF(-308)G>A) were
95.4% (584/612) and 0.17. Compared to the wild type genotype (TT), malaria rates 
were increased in the TNF -1031CC genotype (hazard ratio, HR [95% CI]: 1.41
[1.01‒1.97] and 1.31 [0.97‒1.76] for crude analysis and adjusting for
pre-specified baseline factors, respectively) but decreased in those with the
TNF(-308)AA genotype (corresponding HR: 0.13 [0.02‒0.63] and 0.16 [0.04‒0.67]).
These associations were weaker when analysing first episodes of malaria (P value 
-0.59 and 0.38, respectively). No evidence that allele variants of TNF(-1031) and
TNF(-308) affected haemoglobin concentration at first episode of malaria, or that
they modified the association between Plasmodium infection and haemoglobin
concentrations at baseline was observed.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of Tanzanian children, the TNF (-1031)CC genotype was 
associated with increased rates of malarial episodes, whereas the TNF(-308)AA
genotype was associated with decreased rates.
