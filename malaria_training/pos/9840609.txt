Macrophage scavenger receptor A (MSR-A) deficient mice MSR-A(-/-) were infected
by the intraperitoneal injection of the Plasmodium berghei NK65 strain in the
erythrocytic stage. The MSR-A(-/-) mice died significantly earlier than the
control mice (P=0.060). In the surviving mice, two peaks of parasitemia were
observed: the first 5-7 days and the second at 2-3 weeks after infection. Death
of all MSR-A(-/-) mice occurred at either peak of parasitemia, suggesting that
MSR-A protects mice from severe infection. This model may be useful for the study
of molecular mechanisms of macrophage functions in malaria infection.
