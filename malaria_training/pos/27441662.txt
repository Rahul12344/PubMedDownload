Cerebral malaria (CM) caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites often leads to
the death of infected patients or to persisting neurological sequelae despite
anti-parasitic treatments. Erythropoietin (EPO) was recently suggested as a
potential adjunctive treatment for CM. However diverging results were obtained in
patients from Sub-Saharan countries infected with P. falciparum. In this study,
we measured EPO levels in the plasma of well-defined groups of P.
falciparum-infected patients, from the state of Odisha in India, with mild
malaria (MM), CM, or severe non-CM (NCM). EPO levels were then correlated with
biological parameters, including parasite biomass, heme, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, and
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 plasma concentrations by Spearman's rank
and multiple correlation analyses. We found a significant increase in EPO levels 
with malaria severity degree, and more specifically during fatal CM. In addition,
EPO levels were also found correlated positively with heme, TNF-α, IL-10, IP-10
and MCP-1 during CM. We also found a significant multivariate correlation between
EPO, TNF-α, IL-10, IP-10 MCP-1 and heme, suggesting an association of EPO with a 
network of immune factors in CM patients. The contradictory levels of circulating
EPO reported in CM patients in India when compared to Africa highlights the need 
for the optimization of adjunctive treatments according to the targeted
population.
