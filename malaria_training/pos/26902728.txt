Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinels of the immune system that uniquely prime
naive cells and initiate adaptive immune responses. CD1c (BDCA-1) myeloid DCs
(CD1c(+) mDCs) highly express HLA-DR, have a broad Toll-like receptor (TLR)
repertoire, and secrete immune modulatory cytokines. To better understand immune 
responses to malaria, CD1c(+) mDC maturation and cytokine production were
examined in healthy volunteers before and after experimental intravenous
Plasmodium falciparum infection with 150- or 1,800-parasite-infected red blood
cells (pRBCs). After either dose, CD1c(+) mDCs significantly reduced HLA-DR
expression in prepatent infections. Circulating CD1c(+) mDCs did not upregulate
HLA-DR after pRBC or TLR ligand stimulation and exhibited reduced CD86
expression. At peak parasitemia, CD1c(+) mDCs produced significantly more tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), whereas interleukin-12 (IL-12) production was unchanged.
Interestingly, only the 1,800-pRBC dose caused a reduction in the circulating
CD1c(+) mDC count with evidence of apoptosis. The 1,800-pRBC dose produced no
change in T cell IFN-γ or IL-2 production at peak parasitemia or at 3 weeks
posttreatment. Overall, CD1c(+) mDCs are compromised by P. falciparum exposure,
with impaired HLA-DR and CD86 expression, and have an increased capacity for TNF 
but not IL-12 production. A first prepatent P. falciparum infection is sufficient
to modulate CD1c(+) mDC responsiveness, likely contributing to hampered effector 
T cell cytokine responses and assisting parasite immune evasion.
