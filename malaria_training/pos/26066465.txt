In the erythrocytes, malaria parasite entry and infection is mediated through
complex membrane sorting and signaling processes. We investigated the effects of 
single-locus and multilocus interactions to test the hypothesis that the members 
of the GPCR family genes, adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and G-protein coupled 
receptor kinase5 (GRK5), may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria caused by 
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) independently or through complex interactions. In a
case-control study of adults, individuals affected by Pf malaria (complicated
n=168; uncomplicated n=282) and healthy controls (n=450) were tested for their
association to four known SNPs in GRK5 (rs2230345, rs2275036, rs4752307 and
rs11198918) and two in ADORA2A (rs9624472 and rs5751876) genes with malaria
susceptibility, using techniques of polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphisms and direct DNA sequencing. Single-locus analysis
showed significant association of 2 SNPs; rs5751876 (OR=3.2(2.0-5.2); p=0.0006)
of ADORA2A and rs2230345 (OR=0.3(0.2-0.5); p=0.0006) of GRK5 with malaria. The
mean of the serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with
variant GG (p=0.006) of rs9624472 in ADORA2A gene compared to AA and AG genotypes
in complicated Pf malaria cases, with the G allele also showing increased risk
for malaria (OR=1.3(1.1-1.6); p=0.017). Analyses of predicted haplotypes of the
two ADORA2A and the four GRK5 SNPs have identified the haplotypes that conferred 
risk as well as resistance to malaria with statistical significance. Molecular
docking analysis of evolutionary rs2230345 SNP indicated a stable activity of
GRK5 for the mutant allele compared to the wild type. Further, generalized
multifactor dimensionality reduction to test the contribution of individual
effects of the six polymorphisms and higher-order interactions to risk of
symptoms/clinical complications of malaria suggested a best six-locus model
showing statistical significance. The study provides evidence for the role of
ADORA2A and GRK5 that might influence the etiology of malaria infection.
