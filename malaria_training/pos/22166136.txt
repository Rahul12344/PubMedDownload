BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infection leads to alterations in B cell subset
distribution. During infancy, development of peripheral B cell subsets is also
occurring. However, it is unknown if infants living a malaria endemic region have
alterations in B cell subsets that is independent of an age effect.
METHODS: To evaluate the impact of exposure to P. falciparum on B cell
development in infants, flow cytometry was used to analyse the distribution and
phenotypic characteristic of B cell subsets in infant cohorts prospectively
followed at 12, 18 and 24 months from two geographically proximate regions in
western Kenya with divergent malaria exposure i.e. Kisumu (malaria-endemic, n =
24) and Nandi (unstable malaria transmission, n = 21).
RESULTS: There was significantly higher frequency and absolute cell numbers of
CD19+ B cells in Kisumu relative to Nandi at 12(p = 0.0440), 18(p = 0.0210) and
24 months (p = 0.0493). No differences were observed between the infants from the
two sites in frequencies of na√Øve B cells (IgD+CD27-) or classical memory B cells
(IgD-CD27+). However, immature transitional B cells (CD19+CD10+CD34-) were higher
in Kisumu relative to Nandi at all three ages. In contrast, the levels of
non-class switched memory B cells (CD19+IgD+CD27+) were significantly lower
overall in Kisumu relative to Nandi at significantly at 12 (p = 0.0144), 18 (p = 
0.0013) and 24 months (p = 0.0129).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that infants living in malaria endemic regions
have altered B cell subset distribution. Further studies are needed to understand
the functional significance of these changes and long-term impact on ability of
these infants to develop antibody responses to P. falciparum and heterologous
infections.
