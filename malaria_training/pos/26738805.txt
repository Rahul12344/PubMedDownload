BACKGROUND: The factors leading to poor outcomes in malaria infection are
incompletely understood. Common genetic variation exists in the human genes for
Toll like receptors (TLRs) that alter host responses to pathogen-associated
molecular patterns. Genetic variation in TLR1 and TLR6 could alter the risk of
development of complicated malaria and ability of the host to control the
parasite burden during acute Plasmodium falciparum infection.
METHODS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR1 and TLR6 in 432 patients
with clinical P. falciparum monoinfection acquired on the Thai-Myanmar border
were genotyped. Using logistic regression, associations with the development of
complicated malaria and the percentage of infected erythrocytes (parasitaemia) on
the day of presentation to clinical care (day zero) were tested.
RESULTS: Genotypes carrying the T (major) allele of TLR1 rs5743551--an allele
associated with improved outcomes in sepsis--were associated with higher
parasitaemia measured on day zero (p = 0.03).
DISCUSSION: Since malaria exerts strong genetic pressure on the human genome,
protection from parasitaemia associated with TLR1 rs5743551 may account for the
maintenance of an allele associated with poor outcomes in Caucasians with sepsis.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that genetic variation in TLR1 has effects on the 
host response to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Asian populations. Genotypes
from TLR6 showed no evidence of association with either complicated malaria or
parasite burden.
