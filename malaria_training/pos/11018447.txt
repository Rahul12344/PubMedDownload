Transformation of T cells by the intracellular parasite Theileria parva is
accompanied by constitutive I-kappa B degradation and NF-kappa B activation, a
process which is essential to prevent the spontaneous apoptosis of these
parasite-transformed cells. NF-kappa B-mediated responses are regulated by
selective combinations of NF-kappa B proteins as homo- or heterodimers and by
distinct kappa B motifs. We characterised the NF-kappa B complexes induced by T. 
parva infection in TpM(803) T cells. By western blot, we demonstrated that all
members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins translocate to the nucleus of
infected cells. Using two different kappa B oligonucleotides (kappa B-1 and kappa
B-2), both containing the decameric consensus kappa B motif (GGGACTTTCC), clearly
distinct patterns of DNA binding activities could be demonstrated in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Supershift analysis and UV cross-linking
assays showed that complexes binding to kappa B-1 consisted of p50, p65 and RelB 
homo and/or heterodimers. We could also detect an association of ATF-2 and c-Fos 
with one of the complexes. The HIV-derived kappa B-2 oligo only bound p50 and
p65. Additionally, several agents known to inhibit a wide range of NF-kappa B
activation pathways had no inhibitory effect on the activation of NF-kappa B DNA 
binding in TpM(803) T cells.
