Plasmodium parasites infect the liver and replicate inside hepatocytes before
they invade erythrocytes and trigger clinical malaria. Analysis of host signaling
pathways affected by liver-stage infection could provide critical insights into
host-pathogen interactions and reveal targets for intervention. Using protein
lysate microarrays, we found that Plasmodium yoelii rodent malaria parasites
perturb hepatocyte regulatory pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, 
and autophagy. Notably, the prodeath protein p53 was substantially decreased in
infected hepatocytes, suggesting that it could be targeted by the parasite to
foster survival. Indeed, mice that express increased levels of p53 showed reduced
liver-stage parasite burden, whereas p53 knockout mice suffered increased
liver-stage burden. Furthermore, boosting p53 levels with the use of the small
molecule Nutlin-3 dramatically reduced liver-stage burden in vitro and in vivo.
We conclude that perturbation of the hepatocyte p53 pathway critically impacts
parasite survival. Thus, host pathways might constitute potential targets for
host-based antimalarial prophylaxis.
