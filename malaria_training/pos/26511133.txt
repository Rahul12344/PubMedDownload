Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection is associated with an early marked
increase in plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, together with a
pathological accumulation of hyperreactive ultra-large VWF (UL-VWF) multimers.
Given the established critical role of platelets in malaria pathogenesis, these
increases in plasma VWF raise the intriguing possibility that VWF may play a
direct role in modulating malaria pathogenesis. To address this hypothesis, we
used an established murine model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), in which
wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. In
keeping with findings in children with P falciparum malaria, acute endothelial
cell activation was an early and consistent feature in the murine model of
cerebral malaria (CM), resulting in significantly increased plasma VWF levels.
Despite the fact that murine plasma ADAMTS13 levels were not significantly
reduced, pathological UL-VWF multimers were also observed in murine plasma
following P berghei infection. To determine whether VWF plays a role in
modulating the pathogenesis of CM in vivo, we further investigated P berghei
infection in VWF(-/-) C57BL/6J mice. Clinical ECM progression was delayed, and
overall survival was significantly prolonged in VWF(-/-) mice compared with WT
controls. Despite this protection against ECM, no significant differences in
platelet counts or blood parasitemia levels were observed between VWF(-/-) and WT
mice. Interestingly, however, the degree of ECM-associated enhanced blood-brain
barrier permeability was significantly attenuated in VWF(-/-) mice compared with 
WT controls. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with CM,
these novel data may have direct translational significance.
