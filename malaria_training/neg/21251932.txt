Atovaquone is a hydroxy-naphthoquinone that is used to treat parasitic and fungal
infections including Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Pneumocystis jivorecii
(pneumonia) and Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis). It blocks mitochondrial
oxidation of ubiquinol in these organisms by binding to the ubiquinol oxidation
site of the cytochrome bc(1) complex. Failure of atovaquone treatment has been
linked to the appearance of mutations in the mitochondrially encoded gene for
cytochrome b. In order to determine the optimal parameters required for
inhibition of respiration in parasites and pathogenic fungi and overcome drug
resistance, we have synthesized and tested the inhibitory activity of novel
hydroxy-naphthoquinones against blood stage P. falciparum and liver stage P.
berghei and against cytochrome bc(1) complexes isolated from yeast strains
bearing mutations in cytochrome b associated with resistance in Plasmodium,
Pneumocystis, and Toxoplasma. One of the new inhibitors is highly effective
against an atovaquone resistant Plasmodium and illustrates the type of
modification to the hydroxy-naphthoquinone ring of atovaquone that might mitigate
drug resistance.
