Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich proteins 2 (PfHRP2) based RDTs are advocated
in falciparum malaria-endemic regions, particularly when quality microscopy is
not available. However, diversity and any deletion in the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes
can affect the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs. A total of 400 samples collected
from uncomplicated malaria cases from Kenya were investigated for the amino acid 
repeat profiles in exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes. In addition, PfHRP2 levels 
were measured in 96 individuals with uncomplicated malaria. We observed a unique 
distribution pattern of amino acid repeats both in the PfHRP2 and PfHRP3. 228
PfHRP2 and 124 PfHRP3 different amino acid sequences were identified. Of this,
214 (94%) PfHRP2 and 81 (65%) PfHRP3 amino acid sequences occurred only once.
Thirty-nine new PfHRP2 and 20 new PfHRP3 amino acid repeat types were identified.
PfHRP2 levels were not correlated with parasitemia or the number of PfHRP2 repeat
types. This study shows the variability of PfHRP2, PfHRP3 and PfHRP2
concentration among uncomplicated malaria cases. These findings will be useful to
understand the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs in Kenya.
