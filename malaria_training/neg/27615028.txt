Parasitic unicellular eukaryotes use extracellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles for
intercellular communication and host manipulation. By using various mechanisms to
generate EVs and by transferring a wide range of molecules through EVs,
pathogenic protozoans are able to establish infective niches, modulate the immune
system of the host and cause disease. In addition to effects on the host, EVs are
able to transfer virulence factors, drug-resistance genes and differentiation
factors between parasites. In this Progress article, we explore recent insights
into the biology of EVs from human infectious protozoan parasites, including
Trichomonas vaginalis, Plasmodium spp. and kinetoplastids, such as Trypanosoma
spp. and Leishmania spp.
