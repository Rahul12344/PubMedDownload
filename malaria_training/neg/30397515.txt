Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most
commonly used artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) for treatment of
Plasmodium falciparum in Africa. Both treatments remain efficacious, but single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance
1 (Pfmdr1) gene may compromise sensitivity. AL and AS-AQ exert opposing selective
pressures: parasites with genotype 86Y, Y184 and 1246Y are partially resistant to
AS-AQ treatment, while N86, 184 F and D1246 are favoured by AL treatment. Through
a systematic review, we identified 397 surveys measuring the prevalence of Pfmdr1
polymorphisms at positions 86 184 or 1246 in 30 countries in Africa. Temporal
trends in SNP frequencies after introduction of AL or AS-AQ as first-line
treatment were analysed in 32 locations, and selection coefficients estimated. We
examined associations between antimalarial policies, consumption, transmission
intensity and rate of SNP selection. 1246Y frequency decreased on average more
rapidly in locations where national policy recommended AL (median selection
coefficient(s) of -0.083), compared with policies of AS-AQ or both AL and AS-AQ
(median s=-0.035 and 0.021, p<0.001 respectively). 86Y frequency declined
markedly after ACT policy introduction, with a borderline significant trend for a
more rapid decline in countries with AL policies (p=0.055). However, these trends
could also be explained by a difference in initial SNP frequencies at the time of
ACT introduction. There were non-significant trends for faster selection of N86
and D1246 in areas with higher AL consumption and no trend with transmission
intensity. Recorded consumption of AS-AQ was low in the locations and times
Pfmdr1 data were collected. SNP trends in countries with AL policies suggest a
broad increase in sensitivity of parasites to AS-AQ, by 7-10 years after AL
introduction. Observed rates of selection have implications for planning
strategies to cycle drugs or use multiple first-line therapies to maintain drug
efficacy.
