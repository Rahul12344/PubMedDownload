BACKGROUND: 窶アnalysis of genome-wide polymorphism in many organisms has potential
to identify genes under recent selection. However, data on historical allele
frequency changes are rarely available for direct confirmation.
METHODS: 窶ジe genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 Plasmodium
falciparum drug resistance genes in 668 archived parasite-positive blood samples 
of a Gambian population between 1984 and 2008. This covered a period before
antimalarial resistance was detected locally, through subsequent failure of
multiple drugs until introduction of artemisinin combination therapy. We
separately performed genome-wide sequence analysis of 52 clinical isolates from
2008 to prospect for loci under recent directional selection.
RESULTS: 窶コesistance alleles increased from very low frequencies, peaking in 2000
for chloroquine resistance-associated crt and mdr1 genes and at the end of the
survey period for dhfr and dhps genes respectively associated with pyrimethamine 
and sulfadoxine resistance. Temporal changes fit a model incorporating likely
selection coefficients over the period. Three of the drug resistance loci were in
the top 4 regions under strong selection implicated by the genome-wide analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: 窶エenome-wide polymorphism analysis of an endemic population sample
robustly identifies loci with detailed documentation of recent selection,
demonstrating power to prospectively detect emerging drug resistance genes.
