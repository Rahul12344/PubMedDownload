Objective: Candida albicans is a yeast with multiple genotypes. It's a commensal 
fungus colonizing various sites. However, when the host's immune system weakens, 
it becomes pathogenic and is responsible for various lesions. In Burkina Faso,
antifungal drugs are frequently used, particularly fluconazole, the most used
systemic antifungal. This antifungal drug and other antifungal drugs are often
used for self-medication or prescribed outside of antifungal susceptibility test 
results. These situations led to the emergence of Candida albicans strains
resistant to antifungal drugs commonly used in Burkina Faso. The aim of this
study was to determine the types of Candida albicans using PCRs targeting 25S
rDNA and ALT repeat sequences of the RPS and to establish their azoles and
polyenes susceptibility profile.
Material and methods: Antifungal susceptibility testing by disk diffusion method 
was performed in accordance with CLSI document M44-A for yeasts and the
manufacturer's instructions. Candida albicans isolates were genotyped using
specific PCR primers of the rDNA and RPS genes.
Results: Ten (10) RPS types of Candida albicans were found in our study: The most
common RPS types are A3 (40.6%), A2 (24.0%) and A2/3 (14.6%) for genotype A, B2/3
(5.2%) for genotype B and C2 (3.2%) for genotype C. The Azole resistance,
especially fluconazole (74.4%), was the most common with genotype A, including A3
(36.6%), A2 (18. 3%). Polyene resistance was rare with nystatin, only A3 (1.2%)
resistant isolate to nystatin was observed. For amphotericin B, the highest
observed resistance rates were A3 (11.0%) and A2/3 (8.5%) for the genotype A and 
B2 (10.0%), B3 (10.0%) and B2/3 (10.0%) for genotype B.
Conclusion: Our study showed that Candida albicans resistance to azoles,
especially to fluconazole, is an important phenomenon in Ouagadougou, and several
genotypes RPS types are involved. Thus, fluconazole would not be an antifungal
agent for first-line prescribing for treatment of candidiasis in Ouagadougou.
This study will be continued to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in
these antifungal resistances, for further research of new molecules with
different action targets.
