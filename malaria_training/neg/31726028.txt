Extreme diversity of the major Plasmodium falciparum antigen, PfEMP1, poses a
barrier to identifying targets of immunity to malaria. Here, we used protein
microarrays containing hundreds of variants of the DBLα domain of PfEMP1 to cover
the diversity of Papua New Guinean (PNG) parasites. Probing the plasma of a
longitudinal cohort of malaria-exposed PNG children showed that group 2 DBLα
antibodies were moderately associated with a lower risk of uncomplicated malaria,
whereas individual variants were only weakly associated with clinical immunity.
In contrast, antibodies to 85 individual group 1 and 2 DBLα variants were
associated with a 70%-100% reduction in severe malaria. Of these, 17 variants
were strong predictors of severe malaria. Analysis of full-length PfEMP1
sequences from PNG samples shows that these 17 variants are linked to pathogenic 
CIDR domains. This suggests that whereas immunity to uncomplicated malaria
requires a broad repertoire of antibodies, immunity to severe malaria targets a
subset of conserved variants. These findings provide insights into antimalarial
immunity and potential antibody biomarkers for disease risk.
