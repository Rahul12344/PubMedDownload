Malaria parasites retain a relict plastid (apicoplast) from a photosynthetic
ancestor. The apicoplast is a useful drug target but the specificity of compounds
believed to target apicoplast fatty acid biosynthesis has become uncertain, as
this pathway is not essential in blood stages of the parasite. Herbicides that
inhibit the plastid acetyl Coenzyme A (Co-A) carboxylase of plants also kill
Plasmodium falciparum in vitro, but their mode of action remains undefined. We
characterised the gene for acetyl Co-A carboxylase in P. falciparum. The P.
falciparum acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene product is expressed in blood stage
parasites and accumulates in the apicoplast. Ablation of the gene did not render 
parasites insensitive to herbicides, suggesting that these compounds are acting
off-target in blood stages of P. falciparum.
