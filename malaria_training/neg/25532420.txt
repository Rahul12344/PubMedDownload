Species 6 of the Australasian Anopheles farauti sibling species complex (Diptera:
Culicidae) is described and formally named Anopheles oreios Bangs & Harbach, sp. 
n. Adult, pupal and fourth-instar larval specimens collected in the Baliem
Valley, Papua Province, Indonesia, are characterized and compared with those of
Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum, Anopheles irenicus and Anopheles
torresiensis (formerly informally denoted as species 1, 2, 7 and 3,
respectively). The variable wings of adult females, the male genitalia, the pupa 
and the fourth-instar larva of An. oreios are illustrated and DNA sequence data
are included for regions coding for sections of the mitochondrial COI and COII
genes. The biology of An. oreios and its relation to malaria transmission are
discussed in detail and contrasted with the biology and disease relations of some
members of the An. farauti and Anopheles punctulatus sibling species complexes.
