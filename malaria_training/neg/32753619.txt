Malaria is a devastating infectious disease and the immune response is complex
and dynamic during a course of a malarial infection. Rodent malaria models allow 
detailed time-series studies of the host response in multiple organs. Here, we
describe two comprehensive datasets containing host transcriptomic data from both
the blood and spleen throughout an acute blood stage infection of virulent or
avirulent Plasmodium chabaudi infection in C57BL/6 mice. The mRNA expression
profiles were generated using Illumina BeadChip microarray. These datasets
provide a groundwork for comprehensive and comparative studies on host gene
expression in early, acute and recovering phases of a blood stage infection in
both the blood and spleen, to explore the interaction between the two, and
importantly to investigate whether these responses differ in virulent and
avirulent infections.
