BACKGROUND: Recent studies used the contact data or three-dimensional (3D) genome
reconstructions from Hi-C (chromosome conformation capture with next-generation
sequencing) to assess the co-localization of functional genomic annotations in
the nucleus. These analyses dichotomized data point pairs belonging to a
functional annotation as "close" or "far" based on some threshold and then tested
for enrichment of "close" pairs. We propose an alternative approach that avoids
dichotomization of the data and instead directly estimates the significance of
distances within the 3D reconstruction.
RESULTS: We applied this approach to 3D genome reconstructions for Plasmodium
falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
compared the results to previous approaches. We found significant 3D
co-localization of centromeres, telomeres, virulence genes, and several sets of
genes with developmentally regulated expression in P. falciparum; and significant
3D co-localization of centromeres and long terminal repeats in S. cerevisiae.
Additionally, we tested the experimental observation that telomeres form three to
seven clusters in P. falciparum and S. cerevisiae. Applying affinity propagation 
clustering to telomere coordinates in the 3D reconstructions yielded six telomere
clusters for both organisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Distance-based assessment replicated key findings, while avoiding
dichotomization of the data (which previously yielded threshold-sensitive
results).
