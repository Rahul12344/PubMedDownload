Molecular surveillance for drug-resistant malaria parasites requires reliable,
timely, and scalable methods. These data may be efficiently produced by
genotyping parasite populations using second-generation sequencing (SGS). We
designed and validated a SGS protocol to quantify mutant allele frequencies in
the Plasmodium falciparum genes dhfr and dhps in mixed isolates. We applied this 
new protocol to field isolates from children and compared it to standard
genotyping using Sanger sequencing. The SGS protocol accurately quantified dhfr
and dhps allele frequencies in a mixture of parasite strains. Using SGS of DNA
that was extracted and then pooled from individual isolates, we estimated mutant 
allele frequencies that were closely correlated to those estimated by Sanger
sequencing (correlations, >0.98). The SGS protocol obviated most molecular steps 
in conventional methods and is cost saving for parasite populations >50. This SGS
genotyping method efficiently and reproducibly estimates parasite allele
frequencies within populations of P. falciparum for molecular epidemiologic
studies.
