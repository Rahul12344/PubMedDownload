Malaria is a notorious disease which causes major global morbidity and mortality.
This study aims to investigate the genetic and haplotype differences of
Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi) isolates in Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular
Malaysia based on the molecular analysis of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. The
cyt b gene of 49 P. knowlesi isolates collected from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo and 
Peninsular Malaysia was amplified using PCR, cloned into a commercialized vector 
and sequenced. In addition, 45 cyt b sequences were retrieved from humans and
macaques bringing to a total of 94 cyt b gene nucleotide sequences for
phylogenetic analysis. Genetic and haplotype analyses of the cyt b were analyzed 
using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.01. The haplotype genealogical linkage of cyt b
was generated using NETWORK ver. 4.6.1.3. Our phylogenetic tree revealed the
conservation of the cyt b coding sequences with no distinct cluster across
different geographic regions. Nucleotide analysis of cyt b showed that the P.
knowlesi isolates underwent purifying selection with population expansion, which 
was further supported by extensive haplotype sharing between the macaques and
humans from Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia in the median-joining
network analysis. This study expands knowledge on conservation of the zoonotic P.
knowlesi cyt b gene between Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia.
