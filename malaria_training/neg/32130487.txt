Malaria has been the pre-eminent cause of early mortality in many parts of the
world throughout much of the last five thousand years and, as a result, it is the
strongest force for selective pressure on the human genome yet described. Around 
one third of the variability in the risk of severe and complicated malaria is now
explained by additive host genetic effects. Many individual variants have been
identified that are associated with malaria protection, but the most important
all relate to the structure or function of red blood cells. They include the
classical polymorphisms that cause sickle cell trait, Î±-thalassaemia, G6PD
deficiency, and the major red cell blood group variants. More recently however,
with improving technology and experimental design, others have been identified
that include the Dantu blood group variant, polymorphisms in the red cell
membrane protein ATP2B4, and several variants related to the immune response.
Characterising how these genes confer their effects could eventually inform novel
therapeutic approaches to combat malaria. Nevertheless, all together, only a
small proportion of the heritable component of malaria resistance can be
explained by the variants described so far, underscoring its complex genetic
architecture and the need for continued research.
