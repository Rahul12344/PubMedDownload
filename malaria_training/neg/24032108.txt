There is a rapidly growing body of evidence that production of microvesicles
(MVs) is a universal feature of cellular life. MVs can incorporate microRNA
(miRNA), mRNA, mtDNA, DNA and retrotransposons, camouflage viruses/viral
components from immune surveillance, and transfer cargo between cells. These
properties make MVs an essential player in intercellular communication.
Increasing evidence supports the notion that MVs can also act as long-distance
vehicles for RNA molecules and participate in metabolic synchronization and
reprogramming eukaryotic cells including stem and germinal cells. MV ability to
carry on DNA and their general distribution makes them attractive candidates for 
horizontal gene transfer, particularly between multi-cellular organisms and their
parasites; this suggests important implications for the co-evolution of parasites
and their hosts. In this review, we provide current understanding of the roles
played by MVs in intracellular pathogens and parasitic infections. We also
discuss the possible role of MVs in co-infection and host shifting.
