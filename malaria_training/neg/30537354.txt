The male-biased prevalence of certain neurodevelopmental disorders and the
sex-biased outcomes associated with stress exposure during gestation have been
previously described. Here, we hypothesized that genes distinctively targeted by 
only one or both homologous proteins highly conserved across therian mammals,
SOX3 and SRY, could induce sexual adaptive changes that result in a differential 
risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. ChIP-seq/chip data showed that SOX3/SRY
gene targets were expressed in different brain cell types in mice. We used
orthologous human genes in rodent genomes to extend the number of SOX3/SRY set
(1,721). These genes were later found to be enriched in five modules of
coexpressed genes during the early and mid-gestation periods (FDR < 0.05),
independent of sexual hormones. Genes with differential expression (24,
p < 0.0001) and methylation (40, p < 0.047) between sexes were overrepresented in
this set. Exclusive SOX3 or SRY target genes were more associated with the late
gestational and postnatal periods. Using autism as a model sex-biased disorder,
the SOX3/SRY set was enriched in autism gene databases (FDR ≤ 0.05), and there
were more de novo variations from the male autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples
under the SRY peaks compared to the random peaks (p < 0.024). The comparison of
coexpressed networks of SOX3/SRY target genes between male autism and control
samples revealed low preservation in gene modules related to stress response (99 
genes) and neurogenesis (78 genes). This study provides evidence that while SOX3 
is a regulatory mechanism for both sexes, the male-exclusive SRY also plays a
role in gene regulation, suggesting a potential mechanism for sex bias in ASD.
