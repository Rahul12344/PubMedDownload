In a prospective infant cohort, 21 infants developed Plasmodium vivax malaria
during their first year. Twelve of their mothers also had vivax malaria in the
corresponding pregnancies or postpartum period. The genotypes of the maternal and
infant infections were all different. Eight of the 12 mothers and 9 of the 21
infants had recurrent infections. Relapse parasite genotypes were different to
the initial infection in 13 of 20 (65%) mothers compared with 5 of 24 (21%)
infants (P = .02). The first P. vivax relapses of life are usually genetically
homologous, whereas relapse in adults may result from activation of heterologous 
latent hypnozoites acquired from previous inoculations.
