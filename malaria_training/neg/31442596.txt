BACKGROUND: Gut parasites exert an important influence on the gut microbiome,
with many studies focusing on the human gut microbiome. It has, however,
undergone severe richness depletion. Hygienic lifestyle, antimicrobial treatments
and altered gut homeostasis (e.g., chronic inflammation) reduce gut microbiome
richness and also parasite prevalence; which may confound results. Studying
species closely related to humans could help overcome this problem by providing
insights into the ancestral relationship between humans, their gut microbiome and
their gut parasites. Chimpanzees are a particularly promising model as they have 
similar gut microbiomes to humans and many parasites infect both species.
AIMS: We study the interaction between gut microbiome and enteric parasites in
chimpanzees. Investigating what novel insights a closely related species can
reveal when compared to studies on humans.
METHODS: Using eighty-seven faecal samples from wild western chimpanzees (Pan
troglodytes verus) in Senegal, we combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for
gut microbiome characterization with PCR detection of parasite taxa (Blastocystis
sp., Strongyloides spp., Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., Plasmodium
spp., Filariae and Trypanosomatidae). We test for differences in gut microbiota
ecosystem traits and taxonomical composition between Blastocystis and
Strongyloides bearing and non-bearing samples.
RESULTS: For Blastocystis, twelve differentially abundant taxa (e.g.,
Methanobrevibacter), including Prevotella and Ruminococcus-Methanobrevibacter
enterotype markers, replicate findings in humans. However, several richness
indices are lower in Blastocystis carriers, contradicting human studies. This
indicates Blastocystis, unlike Strongyloides, is associated to a "poor health"
gut microbiome, as does the fact that Faecalibacterium, a bacterium with gut
protective traits, is absent in Blastocystis-positive samples. Strongyloides was 
associated to Alloprevotella and five other taxonomic groups. Each parasite had
its unique impact on the gut microbiota indicating parasite-specific niches. Our 
results suggest that studying the gut microbiomes of wild chimpanzees could help 
disentangle biological from artefactual associations between gut microbiomes and 
parasites.
