BACKGROUND: Concurrent dengue and mixed malaria infections in a single patient
present with overlapping clinical manifestations which pose a diagnostic
challenge and management dilemma in areas of common endemicities.
METHODS: We report a case of a young male who tested positive for both Plasmodium
vivax and Plasmodium falciparum along with dengue infection. He showed signs of
early treatment failure to artemisinin combination therapy (artesunate with
sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine). Molecular analysis for the drug resistance genes viz:
chloroquine resistance (pfcrt), multidrug resistance (pfmdr-1), sulfadoxine
(pfdhps), pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), and artemisinin resistance (keltch 13) was
performed.
RESULTS: A rise in parasitemia from <2% to 5% was observed after 3 days of
treatment. Mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr-1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes were detected as
a possible cause of treatment failure.
CONCLUSION: Increased severity, overlapping symptoms, and suspected resistance to
treatment warrants a multidimensional diagnostic approach and diligent
therapeutic monitoring.
