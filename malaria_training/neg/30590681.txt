BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota were recently shown to impact malaria disease
progression and outcome, and prior studies have shown that Plasmodium infections 
increase the likelihood of enteric bacteria causing systemic infections.
Currently, it is not known whether Plasmodium infection impacts human gut
microbiota as a prelude to bacteremia or whether antimalarials affect gut
microbiota. Our goal was to determine to what degree Plasmodium infections and
antimalarial treatment affect human gut microbiota.
METHODS: One hundred Kenyan infants underwent active surveillance for malaria
from birth to 10 months of age. Each malaria episode was treated with
artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Any other treatments, including antibiotics, were
recorded. Stool samples were collected on an approximately biweekly basis. Ten
children were selected on the basis of stool samples having been collected before
(n = 27) or after (n = 17) a malaria episode and without antibiotics having been 
administered between collections. These samples were subjected to 16S ribosomal
ribonucleic acid gene (V3-V4 region) sequencing.
RESULTS: Bacterial community network analysis revealed no obvious differences in 
the before and after malaria/AL samples, which was consistent with no difference 
in alpha and beta diversity and taxonomic analysis at the family and genus level 
with one exception. At the sequence variant (SV) level, akin to bacterial
species, only 1 of the top 100 SVs was significantly different. In addition,
predicted metagenome analysis revealed no significant difference in metagenomic
capacity between before and after malaria/AL samples. The number of malaria
episodes, 1 versus 2, explained significant variation in gut microbiota
composition of the infants.
CONCLUSIONS: In-depth bioinformatics analysis of stool bacteria has revealed for 
the first time that human malaria episode/AL treatment have minimal effects on
gut microbiota in Kenyan infants.
