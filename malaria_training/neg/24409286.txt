BACKGROUND: New approaches to delivering insecticides need to be developed to
improve malaria vector control. Insecticidal durable wall lining (DL) and net
wall hangings (NWH) are novel alternatives to indoor residual spraying which can 
be produced in a long-lasting format. Non-pyrethroid versions could be used in
combination with long-lasting insecticidal nets for improved control and
management of insecticide resistant vector populations.
METHODS: Experimental hut trials were carried out in Valley du Kou, Burkina Faso 
to evaluate the efficacy of pirimiphos methyl treated DL and NWH either alone or 
in combination with LLINs against pyrethroid resistant Anopheles gambiae ss.
Comparison was made with pyrethroid DL. Mosquitoes were genotyped for kdr and
ace-1R resistant genes to investigate the insecticide resistance management
potential of the combination.
RESULTS: The overall kdr and ace-1(R) allele frequencies were 0.95 and 0.01
respectively. Mortality with p-methyl DL and NWH alone was higher than with
pyrethroid DL alone (>95% vs 40%; P<0.001). Combining pyrethroid DL with LLINs
did not show improvement in mortality (48%) compared to the LLIN alone (44%)
(P>0.1). Combining p-methyl DL or NWH with LLINs reduced biting rates
significantly (8-9%) compared to p-methyl DL and NWH alone (>40%) and killed all 
An gambiae that entered the huts. Mosquitoes bearing the ace-1(R) gene were more 
likely to survive in huts with p-methyl DL alone (p<0.03) whereas all resistant
and susceptible genotypes were killed by the combination.
CONCLUSION: P-methyl DL and NWH outperformed pyrethroid DL. Combining p-methyl DL
and NWH with LLINs could provide significant epidemiological benefits against a
vector population which is resistant to pyrethroids but susceptible to
organophosphates. There was evidence that the single intervention would select
kdr and ace-1(R) resistance genes and the combination intervention might select
less strongly. Technology to bind organophosphates to plastic wall lining would
be worth developing.
