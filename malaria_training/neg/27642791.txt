A molecular understanding of drug resistance mechanisms enables surveillance of
the effectiveness of new antimicrobial therapies during development and
deployment in the field. We used conventional drug resistance selection as well
as a regime of limiting dilution at early stages of drug treatment to probe two
antimalarial imidazolopiperazines, KAF156 and GNF179. The latter approach permits
the isolation of low-fitness mutants that might otherwise be out-competed during 
selection. Whole-genome sequencing of 24 independently derived resistant
Plasmodium falciparum clones revealed four parasites with mutations in the known 
cyclic amine resistance locus (pfcarl) and a further 20 with mutations in two
previously unreported P. falciparum drug resistance genes, an acetyl-CoA
transporter (pfact) and a UDP-galactose transporter (pfugt). Mutations were
validated both in vitro by CRISPR editing in P. falciparum and in vivo by
evolution of resistant Plasmodium berghei mutants. Both PfACT and PfUGT were
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by fluorescence microscopy. As mutations
in pfact and pfugt conveyed resistance against additional unrelated chemical
scaffolds, these genes are probably involved in broad mechanisms of antimalarial 
drug resistance.
