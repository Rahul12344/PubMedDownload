BACKGROUND: Malaria is a devastating infectious disease caused by Plasmodium
parasites transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.
Salivary glands are the only mosquito tissue invaded by Plasmodium sporozoites,
being a key stage for the effective parasite transmission, making the study of
Anopheles sialome highly relevant.
METHODS: RNA-sequencing was used to compare differential gene expression in
salivary glands of uninfected and Plasmodium berghei-infected Anopheles coluzzii 
mosquitoes. RNA-seq results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. The
transmembrane glucose transporter gene AGAP007752 was selected for functional
analysis by RNA interference. The effect of gene silencing on infection level was
evaluated. The putative function and tertiary structure of the protein was
assessed.
RESULTS: RNA-seq data showed that 2588 genes were differentially expressed in
mosquitoes salivary glands in response to P. berghei infection, being 1578
upregulated and 1010 downregulated. Metabolism, Immunity,
Replication/Transcription/Translation, Proteolysis and Transport were the
mosquito gene functional classes more affected by parasite infection.
Endopeptidase coding genes were the most abundant within the differentially
expressed genes in infected salivary glands (P < 0.001). Based on its putative
function and expression level, the transmembrane glucose transporter gene,
AGAP007752, was selected for functional analysis by RNA interference. The results
demonstrated that the number of sporozoites was 44.3% lower in mosquitoes fed on 
infected mice after AGAPP007752 gene knockdown when compared to control
(P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis is that the protein encoded by the gene AGAPP007752
may play a role on An. coluzzii salivary glands infection by Plasmodium parasite,
working as a sporozoite receptor and/or promoting a favorable environment for the
capacity of sporozoites.
