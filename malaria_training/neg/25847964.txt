AMA1-deficient Toxoplasma gondii parasites transiently colonize mice and trigger 
an innate immune response that leads to long-lasting protective immunity.

The apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) protein was believed to be essential for the
perpetuation of two Apicomplexa parasite genera, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, until
we genetically engineered viable parasites lacking AMA1. The reduction in
invasiveness of the Toxoplasma gondii RH-AMA1 knockout (RH-AMA1(KO)) tachyzoite
population, in vitro, raised key questions about the outcome associated with
these tachyzoites once inoculated in the peritoneal cavity of mice. In this
study, we used AMNIS technology to simultaneously quantify and image the
parasitic process driven by AMA1(KO) tachyzoites. We report their ability to
colonize and multiply in mesothelial cells and in both resident and recruited
leukocytes. While the RH-AMA1(KO) population amplification is rapidly lethal in
immunocompromised mice, it is controlled in immunocompetent hosts, where immune
cells in combination sense parasites and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. This 
innate response further leads to a long-lasting status immunoprotective against a
secondary challenge by high inocula of the homologous type I or a distinct type
II T. gondii genotypes. While AMA1 is definitively not an essential protein for
tachyzoite entry and multiplication in host cells, it clearly assists the
expansion of parasite population in vivo.
