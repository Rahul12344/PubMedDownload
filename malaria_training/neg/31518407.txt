BACKGROUND: Cambodia is the epicentre of resistance emergence for virtually all
antimalarial drugs. Selection and spread of parasites resistant to
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is a major threat for malaria
elimination, hence the need to renew the pool of effective treatments.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether ACT resistance haplotypes could have an effect
on ferroquine in vitro antimalarial activity.
METHODS: In vitro susceptibility to ferroquine was measured for 80 isolates from 
Cambodia characterized for their molecular resistance profile to artemisinin,
piperaquine and mefloquine.
RESULTS: Among the 80 isolates tested, the overall median (IQR) IC50 of
ferroquine was 10.9 nM (8.7-18.3). The ferroquine median (IQR) IC50 was 8.9 nM
(8.1-11.8) for Pfk13 WT parasites and was 12.9 nM (9.5-20.0) for Pfk13 C580Y
parasites with no amplification of Pfpm2 and Pfmdr1 genes. The median (IQR) IC50 
of ferroquine for Pfk13 C580Y parasites with amplification of the Pfpm2 gene was 
17.2 nM (14.5-20.5) versus 9.1 nM (7.9-10.7) for Pfk13 C580Y parasites with
amplification of the Pfmdr1 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Ferroquine exerts promising efficacy against ACT-resistant isolates.
Whereas Pfpm2 amplification was associated with the highest parasite tolerance to
ferroquine, the susceptibility range observed was in accordance with those
measured in ACT resistance-free areas. This enables consideration of ferroquine
as a relevant therapeutic option against ACT-resistant malaria.
