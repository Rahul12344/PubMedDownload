In animal model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), the genesis of
neuropathology is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.
There is limited progress in the development of new approaches to the treatment
of cerebral malaria. Here, we tested whether oral supplementation of Coenzyme Q10
(CoQ10) would offer protection against oxidative stress and brain associated
inflammation following Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in C57BL/6 J mouse
model. For this purpose, one group of C57BL/6 mice was used as control; second
group of mice were orally supplemented with 200 mg/kg CoQ10 and then infected
with PbA and the third group was PbA infected alone. Clinical, biochemical,
immunoblot and immunological features of ECM was monitored. We observed that oral
administration of CoQ10 for 1 month and after PbA infection was able to improve
survival, significantly reduced oedema, TNF-α and MIP-1β gene expression in brain
samples in PbA infected mice. The result also shows the ability of CoQ10 to
reduce cholesterol and triglycerides lipids, levels of matrix
metalloproteinases-9, angiopoietin-2 and angiopoietin-1 in the brain. In
addition, CoQ10 was very effective in decreasing NF-κB phosphorylation.
Furthermore, CoQ10 supplementation abrogated Malondialdehyde, and 8-OHDG and
restored cellular glutathione. These results constitute the first demonstration
that oral supplementation of CoQ10 can protect mice against PbA induced oxidative
stress and neuro-inflammation usually observed in ECM. Thus, the need to study
CoQ10 as a candidate of antioxidant and immunomodulatory molecule in ECM and
testing it in clinical studies either alone or in combination with antimalaria
regimens to provide insight into a potential translatable therapy.
