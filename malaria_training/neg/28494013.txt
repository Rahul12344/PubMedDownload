Climatic, sociological and environmental conditions are known to affect the
spatial distribution of malaria vectors and disease transmission. Intensive use
of insecticides in the agricultural and public health sectors exerts a strong
selective pressure on resistance genes in malaria vectors. Spatio-temporal models
of favorable conditions for Anopheles species' presence were developed to
estimate the probability of presence of malaria vectors and insecticide
resistance in Lao PDR. These models were based on environmental and
meteorological conditions, and demographic factors. GIS software was used to
build and manage a spatial database with data collected from various geographic
information providers. GIS was also used to build and run the models. Results
showed that potential insecticide use and therefore the probability of resistance
to insecticide is greater in the southwestern part of the country, specifically
in Champasack province and where malaria incidence is already known to be high.
These findings can help national authorities to implement targeted and effective 
vector control strategies for malaria prevention and elimination among
populations most at risk. Results can also be used to focus the insecticide
resistance surveillance in Anopheles mosquito populations in more restricted
area, reducing the area of surveys, and making the implementation of surveillance
system for Anopheles mosquito insecticide resistance possible.
