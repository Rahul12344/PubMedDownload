BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) caused by Plasmodium falciparum is known to be 
associated with the sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs) in the
microvasculature and the release of soluble cytokines. In addition, the
involvement of signaling molecules has gained wide interest in the pathogenesis
of CM. An important signaling factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is known to 
regulate apoptosis. This work aimed to study the expression of NF-κB p65 and its 
correlation with apoptosis in the brain of fatal CM.
METHODS: The expression of NF-κB p65 and cleaved caspase-3 in the brain of fatal 
P. falciparum malaria cases was investigated by immunohistochemistry.
Histopathological features were analysed together with the correlations of NF-κB 
p65 and cleaved caspase-3 expression.
RESULTS: NF-κB p65 activation and cleaved caspase-3 expression were significantly
increased in the neurons, glial cells, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and
intravascular leukocytes of the brain in fatal CM, compared with the control
brain (p < 0.001) and non-cerebral malaria (NCM) (p = 0.034). The percentage of
neurons that expressed nuclear NF-κB p65 showed a positive correlation with the
total score of histopathological changes (rs = 0.678; p = 0.045). Significant
positive correlations were established between vascular ECs NF-κB index and ECs
apoptotic index (rs = 0.717; p = 0.030) and between intravascular leukocytes
NF-κB index and leukocytes apoptotic index (rs = 0.696; p = 0.037) in fatal CM.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documented that NF-κB p65 is one of the signaling factors
that modulates apoptosis in the brain ECs and intravascular leukocytes of fatal
CM.
