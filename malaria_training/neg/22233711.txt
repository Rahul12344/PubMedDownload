Nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin and play a key
role in the regulation of gene expression. Nucleosome formation depends on
several factors, including properties of the sequence itself, but also physical
constraints and epigenetic factors such as chromatin-remodelling enzymes. In this
view, a sequence-dependent approach is able to capture a general tendency of a
region to bind a histone octamer. A reference data set of positioned nucleosomes 
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to study the role of DNA helical rise in
histone-DNA interaction. Genomic sequences were transformed into arrays of
helical rise values by a tetranucleotide code and then turned into profiles of
mean helical rise values. These profiles resemble maps of nucleosome occupancy,
suggesting that intrinsic histone-DNA interactions are linked to helical rise.
The obtained results show that preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs where the
mean helical rise reaches its largest values. Mean helical rise profiles obtained
by using maps of positioned nucleosomes of the Drosophila melanogaster and
Plasmodium falciparum genomes, as well as Homo sapiens chromosome 20 confirm that
nucleosomes are mainly located where the mean helical rise reaches its largest
values.
