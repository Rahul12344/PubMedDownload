Plasmodium vivax resistance to chloroquine (CQ) was first reported over 60 years 
ago. Here we analyzed sequence variations in the multidrug resistance 1 gene
(Pvmdr1), a putative molecular marker for P. vivax CQ resistance, in field
isolates collected from three sites in Thailand during 2013-2016. Several single 
nucleotide polymorphisms previously implicated in reduced CQ sensitivity were
found. These genetic variations encode amino acids in the two nucleotide-binding 
domains as well as the transmembrane domains of the protein. The high level of
genetic diversity of Pvmdr1 provides insights into the evolutionary history of
this gene. Specifically, there was little evidence of positive selection at amino
acid F1076L in global isolates to be promoted as a possible marker for CQ
resistance. Population genetic analysis clearly divided the parasites into
eastern and western populations, which is consistent with their geographical
separation by the central malaria-free area of Thailand. With CQ-primaquine
remaining as the frontline treatment for vivax malaria in all regions of
Thailand, such a population subdivision could be shaped and affected by the
current drugs for P. falciparum since mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections
often occur in this region.
