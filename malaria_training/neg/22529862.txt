Evidence indicates that cysteine proteases play essential role in malaria
parasites; therefore an obvious area of investigation is the inhibition of these 
enzymes to treat malaria. Studies with cysteine protease inhibitors and
manipulating cysteine proteases genes have suggested a role for cysteine
proteases in hemoglobin hydrolysis. The best characterized Plasmodium cysteine
proteases are falcipains, which are papain family enzymes. Falcipain-2 and
falcipain-3 are major hemoglobinases of P. falciparum. Structural and functional 
analysis of falcipains showed that they have unique domains including a refolding
domain and a hemoglobin binding domain. Overall, the complexes of falcipain-2 and
falcipain-3 with small and macromolecular inhibitors provide structural insight
to facilitate the design or modification of effective drug treatment against
malaria. Drug development targeting falcipains should be aided by a strong
foundation of biochemical and structural studies.
