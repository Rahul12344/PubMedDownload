The ATG genes are highly conserved in eukaryotes including yeasts, plants, and
mammals. However, these genes appear to be only partially present in most
protists. Recent studies demonstrated that, in the apicomplexan parasites
Plasmodium (malaria parasites) and Toxoplasma, ATG8 localizes to the apicoplast, 
a unique nonphotosynthetic plastid with 4 limiting membranes. In contrast to this
established localization, it remains unclear whether these parasites can induce
canonical macroautophagy and if ATG8 localizes to autophagosomes. Furthermore,
the molecular function of ATG8 in its novel workplace, the apicoplast, is totally
unknown. Here, we review recent studies on ATG8 in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma,
summarize both consensus and controversial findings, and discuss its potential
role in these parasites.
