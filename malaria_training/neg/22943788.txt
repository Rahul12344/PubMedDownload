BACKGROUND: The avian disease system in Hawaii offers an ideal opportunity to
investigate host-pathogen interactions in a natural setting. Previous studies
have recognized only a single mitochondrial lineage of avian malaria (Plasmodium 
relictum) in the Hawaiian Islands, but cloning and sequencing of nuclear genes
suggest a higher degree of genetic diversity.
METHODS: In order to evaluate genetic diversity of P. relictum at the population 
level and further understand host-parasite interactions, a modified single-base
extension (SBE) method was used to explore spatial and temporal distribution
patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the thrombospondin-related 
anonymous protein (trap) gene of P. relictum infections from 121 hatch-year
amakihi (Hemignathus virens) on the east side of Hawaii Island.
RESULTS: Rare alleles and mixed infections were documented at three of eight SNP 
loci; this is the first documentation of genetically diverse infections of P.
relictum at the population level in Hawaii. Logistic regression revealed that the
likelihood of infection with a rare allele increased at low-elevation, but
decreased as mosquito capture rates increased. The inverse relationship between
vector capture rates and probability of infection with a rare allele is
unexpected given current theories of epidemiology developed in human malarias.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that pathogen diversity in Hawaii 
may be driven by a complex interaction of factors including transmission rates,
host immune pressures, and parasite-parasite competition.
