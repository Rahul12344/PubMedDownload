Tetracycline resistance by antibiotic inactivation was first identified in
commensal organisms but has since been reported in environmental and pathogenic
microbes. Here, we identify and characterize an expanded pool of tet(X)-like
genes in environmental and human commensal metagenomes via inactivation by
antibiotic selection of metagenomic libraries. These genes formed two distinct
clades according to habitat of origin, and resistance phenotypes were similarly
correlated. Each gene isolated from the human gut encodes resistance to all
tetracyclines tested, including eravacycline and omadacycline. We report a
biochemical and structural characterization of one enzyme, Tet(X7). Further, we
identify Tet(X7) in a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate and demonstrate its
contribution to tetracycline resistance. Lastly, we show anhydrotetracycline and 
semi-synthetic analogues inhibit Tet(X7) to prevent enzymatic tetracycline
degradation and increase tetracycline efficacy against strains expressing
tet(X7). This work improves our understanding of resistance by
tetracycline-inactivation and provides the foundation for an inhibition-based
strategy for countering resistance.
