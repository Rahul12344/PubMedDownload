Malaria is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the Plasmodium genus, which
resulted in an estimated 219 million cases of malaria and 435 000 malaria-related
deaths in 2017. Despite the availability of the Plasmodium falciparum genome
since 2002, 74% of the genes remain uncharacterized. To remedy this paucity of
functional information, we used transcriptomic data to build gene co-expression
networks for two Plasmodium species (P. falciparum and P. berghei), and included 
genomic data of four other Plasmodium species, P. yoelii, P. knowlesi, P. vivax
and P. cynomolgi, as well as two non-Plasmodium species from the Apicomplexa,
Toxoplasma gondii and Theileria parva. The genomic and transcriptomic data were
incorporated into the resulting database, malaria.tools, which is preloaded with 
tools that allow the identification and cross-species comparison of co-expressed 
gene neighbourhoods, clusters and life stage-specific expression, thus providing 
sophisticated tools to predict gene function. Moreover, we exemplify how the
tools can be used to easily identify genes relevant for pathogenicity and various
life stages of the malaria parasite. The database is freely available at
www.malaria.tools.
