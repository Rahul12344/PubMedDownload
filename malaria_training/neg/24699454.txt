The dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes of 44 P. malariae strains from four
Asian countries were isolated. Only a limited number of polymorphisms were
observed. Comparison with homologous mutations in other Plasmodium species showed
that these polymorphisms are unlikely to be associated with sulfadoxine
resistance.
