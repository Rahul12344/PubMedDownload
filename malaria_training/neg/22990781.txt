Transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) allows
investigation of a transcriptome at unsurpassed resolution. One major benefit is 
that RNA-seq is independent of a priori knowledge on the sequence under
investigation, thereby also allowing analysis of poorly characterized Plasmodium 
species. Here we provide a detailed protocol for RNA isolation and fragmentation,
ribosomal RNA depletion, and cDNA synthesis that enables the preparation of a
sequencing library from 1 to 2 μg of total RNA. Although we focus our discussion 
on the quantitative measurement of gene expression, this protocol is suited for
many applications of RNA-seq and allows analysis of most RNA species.
