Chloroquine (CQ) remains the first-line treatment of malaria in Haiti. Given the 
challenges of conducting in vivo drug efficacy trials in low-endemic settings
like Haiti, molecular surveillance for drug resistance markers is a reasonable
approach for detecting resistant parasites. In this study, 349 blood spots were
collected from suspected malaria cases in areas in and around Port-au-Prince from
March to July 2010. Among them, 121 samples that were Plasmodium falciparum
positive by polymerase chain reaction were genotyped for drug-resistant pfcrt,
pfdhfr, pfdhps, and pfmdr1 alleles. Among the 108 samples that were successfully 
sequenced for CQ resistant markers in pfcrt, 107 were wild type (CVMNK), whereas 
one sample carried a CQ-resistant allele (CVIET). Neutral microsatellite
genotyping revealed that the CQ-resistant isolate was distinct from all other
samples in this study. Furthermore, the remaining parasite specimens appeared to 
be genetically distinct from other reported Central and South American
populations.
