Evolving resistance to artemisinin-based compounds threatens to derail attempts
to control malaria. Resistance has been confirmed in western Cambodia and has
recently emerged in western Thailand, but is absent from neighboring Laos.
Artemisinin resistance results in reduced parasite clearance rates (CRs) after
treatment. We used a two-phase strategy to identify genome region(s) underlying
this ongoing selective event. Geographical differentiation and haplotype
structure at 6969 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 91
parasites from Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos identified 33 genome regions under
strong selection. We screened SNPs and microsatellites within these regions in
715 parasites from Thailand, identifying a selective sweep on chromosome 13 that 
shows strong association (P = 10(-6) to 10(-12)) with slow CRs, illustrating the 
efficacy of targeted association for identifying the genetic basis of adaptive
traits.
