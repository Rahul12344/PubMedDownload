BACKGROUND: The malaria parasites in the genus Plasmodium have a very complicated
life cycle involving an invertebrate vector and a vertebrate host. RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) are critical factors involved in every aspect of the development 
of these parasites. However, very few RBPs have been functionally characterized
to date in the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
METHODS: Using different bioinformatic methods and tools we searched P.
falciparum genome to list and annotate RBPs. A representative 3D models for each 
of the RBD domain identified in P. falciparum was created using I-TESSAR and
SWISS-MODEL. Microarray and RNAseq data analysis pertaining PfRBPs was performed 
using MeV software. Finally, Cytoscape was used to create protein-protein
interaction network for CITH-Dozi and Caf1-CCR4-Not complexes.
RESULTS: We report the identification of 189 putative RBP genes belonging to 13
different families in Plasmodium, which comprise 3.5% of all annotated genes.
Almost 90% (169/189) of these genes belong to six prominent RBP classes, namely
RNA recognition motifs, DEAD/H-box RNA helicases, K homology, Zinc finger, Puf
and Alba gene families. Interestingly, almost all of the identified RNA-binding
helicases and KH genes have cognate homologs in model species, suggesting their
evolutionary conservation. Exploration of the existing P. falciparum blood-stage 
transcriptomes revealed that most RBPs have peak mRNA expression levels early
during the intraerythrocytic development cycle, which taper off in later stages. 
Nearly 27% of RBPs have elevated expression in gametocytes, while 47 and 24% have
elevated mRNA expression in ookinete and asexual stages. Comparative interactome 
analyses using human and Plasmodium protein-protein interaction datasets suggest 
extensive conservation of the PfCITH/PfDOZI and PfCaf1-CCR4-NOT complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Plasmodium parasites possess a large number of putative RBPs
belonging to most of RBP families identified so far, suggesting the presence of
extensive post-transcriptional regulation in these parasites. Taken together, in 
silico identification of these putative RBPs provides a foundation for future
functional studies aimed at defining a unique network of post-transcriptional
regulation in P. falciparum.
