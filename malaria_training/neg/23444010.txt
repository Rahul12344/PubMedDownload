Polymorphisms of ATP2B4 encoding an ubiquitous Ca(2+) pump protect against severe
childhood malaria. We assessed the influence of a main polymorphism (rs10900585) 
on malaria among 834 delivering Ghanaian women. In homozygous primiparae, the
odds of placental Plasmodium falciparum infection were reduced by 64%. No
influence of the polymorphism on parasite density, low birth weight, or preterm
delivery was discernible. However, malarial anemia was greatly reduced in
primiparous carriers of the variant allele, paralleling the reduced impact of
malaria on hemoglobin levels in this group. A common ATP2B4 polymorphism protects
against malaria in pregnancy and related maternal anemia, suggesting ATP2B4
variant associated protection not to be limited to severe childhood malaria.
