BACKGROUND: The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii is an important animal 
model for studying host-parasite interaction and molecular basis of malaria
pathogenesis. Although a draft genome of P. yoelii yoelii YM is available, and
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for several rodent malaria species (RMP) were
reported recently, variations in coding regions and structure of mRNA transcript 
are likely present between different parasite strains or subspecies. Sequencing
of cDNA libraries from additional parasite strains/subspecies will help improve
the gene models and genome annotation.
METHODS: Here two directional cDNA libraries from mixed blood stages of a
subspecies of P. yoelii (P. y. nigeriensis NSM) with or without mefloquine (MQ)
treatment were sequenced, and the sequence reads were compared to the genome and 
cDNA sequences of P. y. yoelii YM in public databases to investigate single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions, variations in intron-exon
structure and differential splicing between P. yoelii subspecies, and variations 
in gene expression under MQ pressure.
RESULTS: Approximately 56 million of 100 bp paired-end reads were obtained,
providing an average of ~225-fold coverage for the coding regions. Comparison of 
the sequence reads to the YM genome revealed introns in 5' and 3' untranslated
regions (UTRs), altered intron/exon boundaries, alternative splicing, overlapping
sense-antisense reads, and potentially new transcripts. Interestingly, comparison
of the NSM RNA-seq reads obtained here with those of YM discovered differentially
spliced introns; e.g., spliced introns in one subspecies but not the other.
Alignment of the NSM cDNA sequences to the YM genome sequence also identified
~84,000 SNPs between the two parasites.
CONCLUSION: The discoveries of UTR introns and differentially spliced introns
between P. yoelii subspecies raise interesting questions on the potential role of
these introns in regulating gene expression and evolution of malaria parasites.
