Complementing genome sequence with deep transcriptome and proteome data could
enable more accurate assembly and annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Here, we
provide a proof-of-concept of an integrated approach for analysis of the genome
and proteome of Anopheles stephensi, which is one of the most important vectors
of the malaria parasite. To achieve broad coverage of genes, we carried out
transcriptome sequencing and deep proteome profiling of multiple anatomically
distinct sites. Based on transcriptomic data alone, we identified and corrected
535 events of incomplete genome assembly involving 1196 scaffolds and 868
protein-coding gene models. This proteogenomic approach enabled us to add 365
genes that were missed during genome annotation and identify 917 gene correction 
events through discovery of 151 novel exons, 297 protein extensions, 231 exon
extensions, 192 novel protein start sites, 19 novel translational frames, 28
events of joining of exons, and 76 events of joining of adjacent genes as a
single gene. Incorporation of proteomic evidence allowed us to change the
designation of more than 87 predicted "noncoding RNAs" to conventional mRNAs
coded by protein-coding genes. Importantly, extension of the newly corrected
genome assemblies and gene models to 15 other newly assembled Anopheline genomes 
led to the discovery of a large number of apparent discrepancies in assembly and 
annotation of these genomes. Our data provide a framework for how future genome
sequencing efforts should incorporate transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in
combination with simultaneous manual curation to achieve near complete assembly
and accurate annotation of genomes.
