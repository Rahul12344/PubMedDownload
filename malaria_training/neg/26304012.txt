The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum dramatically remodels its host red
blood cell to enhance its own survival, using a secretory membrane system that it
establishes outside its own cell. Cisternal organelles, called Maurer's clefts,
act as a staging point for the forward trafficking of virulence proteins to the
red blood cell (RBC) membrane. The Ring-EXported Protein-1 (REX1) is a Maurer's
cleft resident protein. We show that inducible knockdown of REX1 causes stacking 
of Maurer's cleft cisternae without disrupting the organization of the
knob-associated histidine-rich protein at the RBC membrane. Genetic dissection of
the REX1 sequence shows that loss of a repeat sequence domain results in the
formation of giant Maurer's cleft stacks. The stacked Maurer's clefts are
decorated with tether-like structures and retain the ability to dock onto the RBC
membrane skeleton. The REX1 mutant parasites show deficient export of the major
virulence protein, PfEMP1, to the red blood cell surface and markedly reduced
binding to the endothelial cell receptor, CD36. REX1 is predicted to form a
largely α-helical structure, with a repetitive charge pattern in the repeat
sequence domain, providing potential insights into the role of REX1 in Maurer's
cleft sculpting.
