In regions of coendemicity for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax where
mefloquine is used to treat P. falciparum infection, drug pressure mediated by
increased copy numbers of the multidrug resistance 1 gene (pvmdr1) may select for
mefloquine-resistant P. vivax Surveillance is not undertaken routinely owing in
part to methodological challenges in detection of gene amplification. Using
genomic data on 88 P. vivax samples from western Thailand, we identified pvmdr1
amplification in 17 isolates, all exhibiting tandem copies of a 37.6-kilobase
pair region with identical breakpoints. A novel breakpoint-specific polymerase
chain reaction assay was designed to detect the amplification. The assay
demonstrated high sensitivity, identifying amplifications in 13 additional,
polyclonal infections. Application to 132 further samples identified the common
breakpoint in all years tested (2003-2015), with a decline in prevalence after
2012 corresponding to local discontinuation of mefloquine regimens. Assessment of
the structure of pvmdr1 amplification in other geographic regions will yield
information about the population-specificity of the breakpoints and underlying
amplification mechanisms.
