Several treatment failures have been reported for the treatment of toxoplasmic
encephalitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital toxoplasmosis. Recently we found
three Toxoplasma gondii strains naturally resistant to sulfadiazine and we
developed in vitro two sulfadiazine resistant strains, RH-R(SDZ) and
ME-49-R(SDZ), by gradual pressure. In Plasmodium, common mechanisms of drug
resistance involve, among others, mutations and/or amplification within genes
encoding the therapeutic targets dhps and dhfr and/or the ABC transporter genes
family. To identify genotypic and/or phenotypic markers of resistance in T.
gondii, we sequenced and analyzed the expression levels of therapeutic targets
dhps and dhfr, three ABC genes, two Pgp, TgABC.B1 and TgABC.B2, and one MRP,
TgABC.C1, on sensitive strains compared to sulfadiazine resistant strains.
Neither polymorphism nor overexpression was identified. Contrary to Plasmodium,
in which mutations and/or overexpression within gene targets and ABC transporters
are involved in antimalarial resistance, T. gondii sulfadiazine resistance is not
related to these toxoplasmic genes studied.
