Glycophorin A and glycophorin B are red blood cell surface proteins and are both 
receptors for the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which is the principal cause of
malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. DUP4 is a complex structural genomic variant that 
carries extra copies of a glycophorin A-glycophorin B fusion gene and has a
dramatic effect on malaria risk by reducing the risk of severe malaria by up to
40%. Using fiber-FISH and Illumina sequencing, we validate the structural
arrangement of the glycophorin locus in the DUP4 variant and reveal somatic
variation in copy number of the glycophorin B-glycophorin A fusion gene. By
developing a simple, specific, PCR-based assay for DUP4, we show that the DUP4
variant reaches a frequency of 13% in the population of a malaria-endemic village
in south-eastern Tanzania. We genotype a substantial proportion of that village
and demonstrate an association of DUP4 genotype with hemoglobin levels, a
phenotype related to malaria, using a family-based association test. Taken
together, we show that DUP4 is a complex structural variant that may be
susceptible to somatic variation and show that DUP4 is associated with a
malarial-related phenotype in a longitudinally followed population.
