BACKGROUND: Africa is the most affected continent with 200,000 new born affected 
by sickle cell anemia annually with of 5% of under five deaths. Nigeria has the
largest sickle cell gene pool in the world with about 2% of all babies born to
Nigerian parents. This study therefore sets out to assess the prevention
practices influencing the frequency of occurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis among 
patients in Ogun State.
METHODS: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Abeokuta 
South Local Government Area Ogun State. A consecutive non randomized sampling of 
all the sickle cell patients that attend the selected facilities was recruited
into the study. Data were collected with the use of questionnaires which were
interviewer administered. A total of 415 patients were recruited into the study. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 20.0.
RESULT: Two- third [64.8%] of study participants have crisis twice or more in a
month. The frequency of crisis was statistically significantly associated with
the age of the child [p = 0.006], use of anti-malaria prophylaxis [p = 0.006],
analgesics [p = 0.0001], taking of plenty fluid [p = 0.001] and soothing herbs
[p = 0.0001]. Lifestyle factors such as giving balance diet [p = 0.217],
restriction from strenuous activities [p = 0.08], and attending Clinic
appointments regularly [p = 0.126] were not statistically associated with
reduction in the frequency of crisis. Logistic regression analysis shows that
predictors of frequent crisis were individuals who were using prophylaxis
antimalarial drugs [OR = 0.12, CI = 0.05-0.33] and analgesics [OR = 0.15,
C.I = 0.06-0.34].
CONCLUSION: The study reveals that majority of the participants have high
frequency of crisis in a month. Drug prophylaxis rather than lifestyle factors
may be more important in the prevention of vaso-occlusive crisis among sickle
cell patients.
