Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) interrupt malaria parasite transmission and 
hence form an important component for malaria eradication. Mosquito midgut
exopeptidases such as aminopeptidase N & carboxypeptidase B have demonstrated TBV
potential. In the present study, we cloned and characterized carboxypeptidase A
(CPA) from the midgut of an important malarial vector, Anopheles stephensi.
ClustalW amino acid alignment and in silico 3-dimensional structure analysis of
CPA predicted the presence of active sites involved in zinc and substrate binding
that are conserved among all the known mosquito species. Real-time PCR analysis
demonstrated that CPA is predominantly expressed in the midgut throughout the
mosquito life cycle and that this gene is significantly elevated in P.
berghei-infected mosquitoes compared to uninfected blood-fed controls. The high
midgut CPA activity correlated with the prominent mRNA levels observed.
Peptide-based anti-CPA antibodies were raised that cross-reacted specifically to 
∼48kDa and ∼37kDa bands, which correspond to zymogen and active forms of CPA.
Further, the addition of CPA-directed antibodies to P. berghei-containing blood
meal significantly reduced the mosquito infection rate in the test group compared
to control and blocked the parasite development in the midgut. These results
support further development of A. stephensi CPA as a candidate TBV.
