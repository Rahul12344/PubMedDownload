Malaria parasites invade red blood cells (RBCs), consume copious amounts of
hemoglobin, and severely disrupt iron regulation in humans. Anemia often
accompanies malaria disease; however, iron supplementation therapy inexplicably
exacerbates malarial infections. Here we found that the iron exporter ferroportin
(FPN) was highly abundant in RBCs, and iron supplementation suppressed its
activity. Conditional deletion of the Fpn gene in erythroid cells resulted in
accumulation of excess intracellular iron, cellular damage, hemolysis, and
increased fatality in malaria-infected mice. In humans, a prevalent FPN mutation,
Q248H (glutamine to histidine at position 248), prevented hepcidin-induced
degradation of FPN and protected against severe malaria disease. FPN Q248H
appears to have been positively selected in African populations in response to
the impact of malaria disease. Thus, FPN protects RBCs against oxidative stress
and malaria infection.
