BACKGROUND: The main goal of present study was to detect polymorphism in MSP-1
gene which is a major blood stage candidate for vaccine in Plasmodium vivax by
Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SSCP-PCR).
METHODS: During 2008 to 2010 fifty samples were collected from Iranian patients
with P. vivax in Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. All of the samples were
detected by microscopical examination. Amplification of MSP-1 gene was done by
PCR after DNA extraction. Single strand DNAs due to using in SSCP, was
electrophoresed on polyacrylamid- Bisacrylamid gel then banding patterns were
revealed by silver-staining method. Sequencing as a typing method was performed
for some isolates.
RESULTS: All of the 50 isolates were positive microscopically. Totally 12 (24%)
isolates showed 440 bp and 38 (76%) showed 500 bp in PCR assay. SSCP analysis
revealed four banding patterns. Pattern I (10/50), Pattern II (12/50), Pattern
III (27/50), and Pattern IV (1/50). The results sequencing analysis of the MSP-1 
gene in 19 isolates revealed diversity in nucleotides and amino acid in Iranian
P. vivax isolates.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that the SSCP-PCR is a rapid method for detecting 
polymorphism in MSP-1 gene in P. vivax. The presence of different haplotypes in
MSP-1 gene shows that several P. vivax strains exist in malaria endemic areas of 
Iran.
