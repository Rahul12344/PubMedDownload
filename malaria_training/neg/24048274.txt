In the last decade, there has been an upsurge of interest in developing malaria
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits for the detection of Plasmodium species. Three
antigens - Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), plasmodial
aldolase and plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) - are currently used for
RDTs. Tests targeting HRP2 contribute to more than 90% of the malaria RDTs in
current use. However, the specificities, sensitivities, numbers of false
positives, numbers of false negatives and temperature tolerances of these tests
vary considerably, illustrating the difficulties and challenges facing current
RDTs. This paper describes recent developments in malaria RDTs, reviewing RDTs
detecting PfHRP2, pLDH and plasmodial aldolase. The difficulties associated with 
RDTs, such as genetic variability in the Pfhrp2 gene and the persistence of
antigens in the bloodstream following the elimination of parasites, are
discussed. The prospect of overcoming the problems associated with current RDTs
with a new generation of alternative malaria antigen targets is also described.
