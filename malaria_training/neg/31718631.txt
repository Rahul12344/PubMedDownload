BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is one of the greatest challenges of malaria control 
programme in Mali. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies provide new and effective ways of tracking drug-resistant malaria
parasites in Africa. The diversity and the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum
drug-resistance molecular markers were assessed in Dangassa and Nioro-du-Sahel in
Mali, two sites with distinct malaria transmission patterns. Dangassa has an
intense seasonal malaria transmission, whereas Nioro-du-Sahel has an unstable and
short seasonal malaria transmission.
METHODS: Up to 270 dried blood spot samples (214 in Dangassa and 56 in
Nioro-du-Sahel) were collected from P. falciparum positive patients in 2016.
Samples were analysed on the Agena MassARRAY® iPLEX platform. Specific codons
were targeted in Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, and Pfdhps, Pfarps10, Pfferredoxin,
Pfexonuclease and Pfmdr2 genes. The Sanger's 101-SNPs-barcode method was used to 
assess the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and to determine the parasite
species.
RESULTS: The Pfcrt_76T chloroquine-resistance genotype was found at a rate of
64.4% in Dangassa and 45.2% in Nioro-du-Sahel (p = 0.025). The
Pfdhfr_51I-59R-108N pyrimethamine-resistance genotype was 14.1% and 19.6%,
respectively in Dangassa and Nioro-du-Sahel. Mutations in the
Pfdhps_S436-A437-K540-A581-613A sulfadoxine-resistance gene was significantly
more prevalent in Dangassa as compared to Nioro-du-Sahel (p = 0.035). Up to 17.8%
of the isolates from Dangassa vs 7% from Nioro-du-Sahel harboured at least two
codon substitutions in this haplotype. The amodiaquine-resistance Pfmdr1_N86Y
mutation was identified in only three samples (two in Dangassa and one in
Nioro-du-Sahel). The lumefantrine-reduced susceptibility Pfmdr1_Y184F mutation
was found in 39.9% and 48.2% of samples in Dangassa and Nioro-du-Sahel,
respectively. One piperaquine-resistance Exo_E415G mutation was found in
Dangassa, while no artemisinin resistance genetic-background were identified. A
high P. falciparum diversity was observed, but no clear genetic aggregation was
found at either study sites. Higher multiplicity of infection was observed in
Dangassa with both COIL (p = 0.04) and Real McCOIL (p = 0.02) methods relative to
Nioro-du-Sahel.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals high prevalence of chloroquine and
pyrimethamine-resistance markers as well as high codon substitution rate in the
sulfadoxine-resistance gene. High genetic diversity of P. falciparum was
observed. These observations suggest that the use of artemisinins is relevant in 
both Dangassa and Nioro-du-Sahel.
