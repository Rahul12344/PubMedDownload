The shikimate pathway enzyme that generates chorismate is not required for the
development of Plasmodium berghei in the mammalian host nor the mosquito vector.

In Plasmodium, the shikimate pathway is a potential target for malaria
chemotherapy owing to its absence in the mammalian host. Chorismate, the end
product of this pathway, serves as a precursor for aromatic amino acids,
Para-aminobenzoic acid and ubiquinone, and is synthesised by Chorismate synthase 
(CS). Therefore, it follows that the Cs locus may be refractory to genetic
manipulation. By utilising a conditional mutagenesis system of yeast Flp/FRT, we 
demonstrate an unexpectedly dispensable role of CS in Plasmodium. Our studies
reiterate the need to establish an obligate reliance on Plasmodium metabolic
enzymes through genetic approaches before their selection as drug targets.
