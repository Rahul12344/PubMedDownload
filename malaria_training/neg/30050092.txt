Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe manifestation of infection with
Plasmodium, however its pathogenesis is still not completely understood. microRNA
(miRNA) have been an area of focus in infectious disease research, due to their
ability to affect normal biological processes, and have been shown to play roles 
in various viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, including malaria. The
expression of miRNA was studied following infection of CBA mice with either
Plasmodium berghei ANKA (causing CM), or Plasmodium yoelii (causing severe but
non-cerebral malaria (NCM)). Using microarray analysis, miRNA expression was
compared in the brains of non-infected (NI), NCM and CM mice. Six miRNA were
significantly dysregulated between NCM and CM mice, and four of these,
miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, miR-142-3p and miR-223-3p, were further validated by qPCR
assays. These miRNA are significantly involved in several pathways relevant to
CM, including the TGF-β and endocytosis pathways. Dysregulation of these miRNA
during CM specifically compared with NCM suggests that these miRNA, through their
regulation of downstream targets, may be vitally involved in the neurological
syndrome. Our data implies that, at least in the mouse model, miRNA may play a
regulatory role in CM pathogenesis.
