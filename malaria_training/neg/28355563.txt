Malaria sporozoites are deposited into the skin by mosquitoes and infect
hepatocytes. The molecular basis of how Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites migrate
through host cells is poorly understood, and direct evidence of its importance
in vivo is lacking. Here, we generated traversal-deficient sporozoites by genetic
disruption of sporozoite microneme protein essential for cell traversal (PfSPECT)
or perforin-like protein 1 (PfPLP1). Loss of either gene did not affect
P. falciparum growth in erythrocytes, in contrast with a previous report that
PfPLP1 is essential for merozoite egress. However, although traversal-deficient
sporozoites could invade hepatocytes in vitro, they could not establish normal
liver infection in humanized mice. This is in contrast with NF54 sporozoites,
which infected the humanized mice and developed into exoerythrocytic forms. This 
study demonstrates that SPECT and perforin-like protein 1 (PLP1) are critical for
transcellular migration by P. falciparum sporozoites and demonstrates the
importance of cell traversal for liver infection by this human pathogen.
