Cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to host
microvasculature is a key virulence determinant. Parasite binding is mediated by 
a large family of clonally variant adhesion proteins, termed P. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), encoded by var genes and expressed at
the infected erythrocyte surface. Although PfEMP1 proteins have extensively
diverged under opposing selection pressure to maintain ligand binding while
avoiding antibody-mediated detection, recent work has revealed they can be
classified into different groups based on chromosome location and domain
composition. This grouping reflects functional specialization of PfEMP1 proteins 
for different human host and microvascular binding niches and appears to be
maintained by gene recombination hierarchies. Inone extreme, a specific PfEMP1
variant is associated with placental binding and malaria during pregnancy, while 
other PfEMP1 subtypes appear to be specialized for infection of malaria naïve
hosts. Here, we discuss recent findings on the origins and evolution of the var
gene family, the structure-function of PfEMP1 proteins, and a distinct subset of 
PfEMP1 variants that have been associated with severe childhood malaria.
