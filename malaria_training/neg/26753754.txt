BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes acute
haemolytic anaemia triggered by oxidative drugs such as primaquine (PQ), used for
Plasmodium vivax malaria radical cure. However, in many endemic areas of vivax
malaria, patients are treated with PQ without any evaluation of their G6PD
status.
METHODS: G6PD deficiency and its genetic heterogeneity were evaluated in
northeastern and southeastern areas from Venezuela, Cajigal (Sucre state) and
Sifontes (Bolívar state) municipalities, respectively. Blood samples from 664
randomly recruited unrelated individuals were screened for G6PD activity by a
quantitative method. Mutation analysis for exons 4-8 of G6PD gen was performed on
DNA isolated from G6PD-deficient (G6PDd) subjects through PCR-RFLP and direct DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Quantitative biochemical characterization revealed that overall 24
(3.6%) subjects were G6PDd (average G6PD enzyme activity 4.5 ± 1.2 U/g Hb,
moderately deficient, class III), while DNA analysis showed one or two mutated
alleles in 19 of them (79.2%). The G6PD A-(202A/376G) variant was the only
detected in 17 (70.8%) individuals, 13 of them hemizygous males and four
heterozygous females. Two males carried only the 376A → G mutation. No other
mutation was found in the analysed exons.
CONCLUSIONS: The G6PDd prevalence was as low as that one shown by nearby
countries. This study contributes to the knowledge of the genetic background of
Venezuelan population, especially of those living in malaria-endemic areas.
Despite the high degree of genetic mixing described for Venezuelan population, a 
net predominance of the mild African G6PD A-(202A/376G) variant was observed
among G6PDd subjects, suggesting a significant flow of G6PD genes from Africa to 
Americas, almost certainly introduced through African and/or Spanish immigrants
during and after the colonization. The data suggest that 1:27 individuals of the 
studied population could be G6PDd and therefore at risk of haemolysis under
precipitating factors. Information about PQ effect on G6PDd individuals carrying 
mild variant is limited, but since the regimen of 45 mg weekly dose for
prevention of malaria relapse does not seem to be causing clinically significant 
haemolysis in people having the G6PD A-variant, a reasoned weighing of
risk-benefit for its use in Venezuela should be done, when implementing public
health strategies of control and elimination.
