The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum dynamically regulates transcription of
the majority of its genes during its intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.
Chromatin is an important contributor to this tight regulation of gene
expression. P. falciparum appears to utilize most of the mechanisms of chromatin 
creation and modification found in other eukaryotes, although it occasionally
uses them in surprising ways. Much of the P. falciparum genome is maintained in a
euchromatic state, potentially permissive for transcription and heterochromatin
appears to have a specialized role limited to silencing islands of genes involved
in redundant host-parasite interactions. P. falciparum histones share canonical
modifications with other eukaryotes but also have unique modifications of unknown
function including hyperacetylations of two alternative histones possibly
involved in gene regulation. Much of our knowledge of chromatin regulation of
gene expression in P. falciparum derives from the study of virulence genes that
are subject to chromatin regulatory mechanisms ranging from histone modifications
and nucleosomal occupancy to non-protein-coding RNAs and subnuclear architecture.
These mechanisms will be discussed along with other characterized components of
P. falciparum chromatin.
