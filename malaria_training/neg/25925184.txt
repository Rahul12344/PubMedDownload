Genetic polymorphisms of pvdhfr and pvdhps genes of Plasmodium vivax were
investigated in 83 blood samples collected from patients in the Philippines,
Bangladesh, and Nepal. The SNP-haplotypes of the pvdhfr gene at the amino acid
positions 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and 173, and that of the pvdhps gene at the
positions 383 and 553 were analyzed by nested PCR-RFLP. Results suggest diverse
polymorphic patterns of pvdhfr alone as well as the combination patterns with
pvdhps mutant alleles in P. vivax isolates collected from the 3 endemic countries
in Asia. All samples carried mutant combination alleles of pvdhfr and pvdhps. The
most prevalent combination alleles found in samples from the Philippines and
Bangladesh were triple mutant pvdhfr combined with single mutant pvdhps allele
and triple mutant pvdhfr combined with double wild-type pvdhps alleles,
respectively. Those collected from Nepal were quadruple mutant pvdhfr combined
with double wild-type pvdhps alleles. New alternative antifolate drugs which are 
effective against sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)-resistant P. vivax are required.
