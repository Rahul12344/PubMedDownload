BACKGROUND: Pathway enrichment techniques are useful for understanding
experimental metabolomics data. Their purpose is to give context to the affected 
metabolites in terms of the prior knowledge contained in metabolic pathways.
However, the interpretation of a prioritized pathway list is still challenging,
as pathways show overlap and cross talk effects.
RESULTS: We introduce FELLA, an R package to perform a network-based enrichment
of a list of affected metabolites. FELLA builds a hierarchical representation of 
an organism biochemistry from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
containing pathways, modules, enzymes, reactions and metabolites. In addition to 
providing a list of pathways, FELLA reports intermediate entities (modules,
enzymes, reactions) that link the input metabolites to them. This sheds light on 
pathway cross talk and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the
condition under study. FELLA has been applied to six public datasets -three from 
Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus musculus- and has reproduced 
findings from the original studies and from independent literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The R package FELLA offers an innovative enrichment concept starting
from a list of metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the KEGG
database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting a list of pathways, 
FELLA suggests intermediate entities that are of interest per se. Its usefulness 
has been shown at several molecular levels on six public datasets, including
human and animal models. The user can run the enrichment analysis through a
simple interactive graphical interface or programmatically. FELLA is publicly
available in Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license.
