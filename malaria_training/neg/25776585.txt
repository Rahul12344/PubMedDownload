Mismatch specific endonuclease (MSE) method was used to detect natural
polymorphisms in Pvs25 and Pv38 genes of Plasmodium vivax. Eighty seven patients 
with P. vivax were recruited in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Pvs25 and Pv38 genes
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR amplicons were
mixed with reference DNA sequences. Following the denaturation and gradual
annealing, the product mixtures were cleaved by the MSE. Heteroduplex types were 
readily detected by gel electrophoresis, where extra bands with shorter sizes
would appear from the cleavage. After MSE cleavage of 657- bp product from Pvs25 
mixtures, three genotypes were detected, while Pv38 mixtures with 1220-bp
products presented two genotypes in ROK isolates. After the MSE cleavage, the
mismatched samples of Pvs25 and Pv38 were completely sequenced, and the results
were in complete agreement with the MSE analyses. In conclusion, genotyping of
Pvs25 and Pv38 with MSE cleavage could be a potential method for the
high-throughput screening of the large field samples.
