BACKGROUND: Control of malaria is threatened by emerging parasite resistance to
artemisinin and derivative drug (ART) therapies. The molecular detail of how
Plasmodium malaria parasites respond to ART and how this could contribute to
resistance are not well understood. To address this question, we performed a
transcriptomic study of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) response in P. falciparum K1
strain and in P. berghei ANKA strain using microarray and RNA-seq technology.
RESULTS: Microarray data from DHA-treated P. falciparum trophozoite stage
parasites revealed a response pattern that is overall less trophozoite-like and
more like the other stages of asexual development. A meta-analysis of these data 
with previously published data from other ART treatments revealed a set of common
differentially expressed genes. Notably, ribosomal protein genes are
down-regulated in response to ART. A similar pattern of trophozoite
transcriptomic change was observed from RNA-seq data. RNA-seq data from
DHA-treated P. falciparum rings reveal a more muted response, although there is
considerable overlap of differentially expressed genes with DHA-treated
trophozoites. No genes are differentially expressed in DHA-treated P. falciparum 
schizonts. The transcriptional response of P. berghei to DHA treatment in vivo in
infected mice is similar to the P. falciparum in vitro culture ring and
trophozoite responses, in which ribosomal protein genes are notably
down-regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Ring and trophozoite stage Plasmodium respond to ART by arresting
metabolic processes such as protein synthesis and glycolysis. This response can
be protective in rings, as shown by the phenomenon of dormancy. In contrast, this
response is not as protective in trophozoites owing to their commitment to a
highly active and vulnerable metabolic state. The lower metabolic demands of
schizonts could explain why they are less sensitive and unresponsive to ART. The 
ART response pattern is revealed clearly from RNA-seq data, suggesting that this 
technology is of great utility for studying drug response in Plasmodium.
