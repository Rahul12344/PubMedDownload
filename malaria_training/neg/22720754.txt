BACKGROUND: Several electroporation protocols exist to transfect exogenous DNA
into Plasmodium falciparum. To date, however, only a subjective analysis of their
relative efficiencies has been reported.
METHODS: A time-course of luciferase reporter expression is used to provide an
objective quantitative analysis of the absolute efficiency of three
electroporation techniques; direct electroporation of ring stage infected
erythrocytes, preloading of erythrocytes and a novel "double-tap" protocol that
combines both approaches.
RESULTS: Preloading of erythrocytes shows a mean efficiency of 9.59 x 10(-6),
some 5-180 fold more efficient than matched experiments utilizing the
"double-tap" and direct electroporation of ring stage infected erythrocytes
alone, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Evidence presented here provides the first quantitative assessment of
both the absolute and relative efficiencies of a key molecular tool used to study
the biology and pathogenesis of this important human pathogen.
