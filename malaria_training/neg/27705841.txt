Ketotifen has recently been reported to inhibit the growth of both asexual and
sexual malaria parasites. A parasite transporter, PfgABCG2, has been implicated
in its mechanism of action. Human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) is the most
commonly used selectable marker to create transgenic Plasmodium falciparum cell
lines. Growth assays using transgenic P. falciparum parasites with different
selectable markers revealed that the presence of hDHFR rather than the absence of
PfgABCG2 is responsible for a shift in the parasite's sensitivity to ketotifen.
Employing a range of in vitro assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
we show that ketotifen influences hDHFR activity, but it is not metabolised by
the enzyme. Our data also highlights potential pitfalls when functionally
characterising transgenic parasites.
