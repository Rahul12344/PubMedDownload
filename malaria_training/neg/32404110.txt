BACKGROUND: Long regarded as an epicenter of drug-resistant malaria, Southeast
Asia continues to provide new challenges to the control of Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria. Recently, resistance to the artemisinin combination therapy partner drug
piperaquine has been observed in multiple locations across Southeast Asia.
Genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as copy
number variations in the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes, which encode
haemoglobin-degrading proteases that associate with clinical and in vitro
piperaquine resistance.
RESULTS: To accurately and quickly determine the presence of copy number
variations in the plasmepsin 2/3 genes in field isolates, this study developed a 
quantitative PCR assay using TaqMan probes. Copy number estimates were validated 
using a separate SYBR green-based quantitative PCR assay as well as a novel
PCR-based breakpoint assay to detect the hybrid gene product. Field samples from 
2012 to 2015 across three sites in Cambodia were tested using DNA extracted from 
dried blood spots and whole blood to monitor the extent of plasmepsin 2/3 gene
amplifications, as well as amplifications in the multidrug resistance transporter
1 gene (pfmdr1), a marker of mefloquine resistance. This study found high
concordance across all methods of copy number detection. For samples derived from
dried blood spots, a success rate greater than 80% was found in each assay, with 
more recent samples performing better. Evidence of extensive plasmepsin 2/3 copy 
number amplifications was observed in Pursat (94%, 2015) (Western Cambodia) and
Preah Vihear (87%, 2014) (Northern Cambodia), and lower levels in Ratanakiri
(16%, 2014) (Eastern Cambodia). A shift was observed from two copies of
plasmepsin 2 in Pursat in 2013 to three copies in 2014-2015 (25% to 64%). Pfmdr1 
amplifications were absent in all samples from Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri in
2014 and absent in Pursat in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex TaqMan assay is a robust tool for monitoring both
plasmepsin 2/3 and pfmdr1 copy number variations in field isolates, and the
SYBR-green and breakpoint assays are useful for monitoring plasmepsin 2/3
amplifications. This study shows increasing levels of plasmepsin 2 copy numbers
across Cambodia from 2012 to 2015 and a complete reversion of multicopy pfmdr1
parasites to single copy parasites in all study locations.
