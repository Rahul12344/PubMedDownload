We characterized the dual oxidase (Duox) gene in the major Indian malaria vector 
Anopheles stephensi, which regulates the generation of reactive oxygen species.
The AsDuox gene encodes for a 1,475-amino-acid transmembrane protein that
contains an N-terminal noncytoplasmic heme peroxidase domain, a calcium-binding
domain, seven transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic NADPH domain.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that A. stephensi Duox protein is highly conserved
and shares 97-100% amino acid identity with other anopheline Duoxes. AsDuox is
expressed in all the developmental stages of A. stephensi and the pupal stages
revealed relatively higher expressions. The Duox gene is induced in
Plasmodium-infected mosquito midguts, and RNA interference-mediated silencing of 
this gene suppressed parasite development through activation of the
thioester-containing protein 1 pathway. We propose that this highly conserved
anopheline Duox, being a Plasmodium agonist, is an excellent target to control
malaria parasite development inside the insect host.
