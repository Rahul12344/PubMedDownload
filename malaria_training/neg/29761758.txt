In the Peruvian North Coast (PNC), the number of Plasmodium vivax malaria cases
increased steadily from 2007 to 2010 despite a significant decline in the overall
number of cases in Peru during the same period. To better understand the
transmission dynamics of P. vivax populations in the PNC and the neighboring
Ecuadorian Amazon Basin (EAB), we studied the genetic variability and population 
structure of P. vivax in these areas. One hundred and twenty P. vivax isolates
(58 from Piura and 37 from Tumbes in the PNC collected from 2008 to 2010 and 25
from the EAB collected in Pastaza from 2001 to 2004) were assessed by five
polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic variability was determined by
expected heterozygosity (He) and population structure by Bayesian inference
cluster analysis. We found very low genetic diversity in the PNC (He = 0-0.32)
but high genetic diversity in the EAB (He = 0.43-0.70). Population structure
analysis revealed three distinct populations in the three locations. Six of 37
(16%) isolates from Tumbes had an identical haplotype to that found in Piura,
suggesting unidirectional flow from Piura to Tumbes. In addition, one haplotype
from Tumbes showed similarity to a haplotype found in Pastaza, suggesting that
this could be an imported case from EAB. These findings strongly suggest a
minimal population flow and different levels of genetic variability between these
two areas divided by the Andes Mountains. This work presents molecular markers
that could be used to increase our understanding of regional malaria transmission
dynamics, which has implications for the development of strategies for P. vivax
control.
