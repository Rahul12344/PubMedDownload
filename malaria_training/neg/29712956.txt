Aedes aegypti is the primary urban mosquito vector of viruses causing dengue,
Zika and chikungunya fevers -for which vaccines and effective pharmaceuticals are
still lacking. Current strategies to suppress arbovirus outbreaks include removal
of larval-breeding sites and insecticide treatment of larval and adult
populations. Insecticidal control of Ae. aegypti is challenging, due to a recent 
rapid global increase in knockdown-resistance (kdr) to pyrethroid insecticides.
Widespread, heavy use of pyrethroid space-sprays has created an immense selection
pressure for kdr, which is primarily under the control of the voltage-gated
sodium channel gene (vgsc). To date, eleven replacements in vgsc have been
discovered, published and shown to be associated with pyrethroid resistance to
varying degrees. In Mexico, F1,534C and V1,016I have co-evolved in the last 16
years across Ae. aegypti populations. Recently, a novel replacement V410L was
identified in Brazil and its effect on vgsc was confirmed by electrophysiology.
Herein, we screened V410L in 25 Ae. aegypti historical collections from Mexico,
the first heterozygote appeared in 2002 and frequencies have increased in the
last 16 years alongside V1,016I and F1,534C. Knowledge of the specific vgsc
replacements and their interaction to confer resistance is essential to predict
and to develop strategies for resistance management.
