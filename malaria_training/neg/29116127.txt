Deletions of the Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 and hrp3 genes can affect the
performance of HRP2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Such deletions
have been reported from South America, India and Eritrea. Whether these parasites
are widespread in East Africa is unknown. A total of 274 samples from
asymptomatic children in Mbita, western Kenya, and 61 genomic  data from Kilifi, 
eastern Kenya, were available for analysis. PCR-confirmed samples were
investigated for the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes. In samples with
evidence of deletion, parasite presence was confirmed by amplifying three
independent genes. We failed to amplify pfhrp2 from 25 of 131 (19.1%)
PCR-confirmed samples. Of these, only 8 (10%) samples were microscopic positive
and were classified as pfhrp2-deleted. Eight microscopically-confirmed
pfhrp2-deleted samples with intact pfhrp3 locus were positive by HRP2-based RDT. 
In addition, one PCR-confirmed infection showed a deletion at the pfhrp3 locus.
One genomic sample lacked pfhrp2 and one lacked pfhrp3. No sample harbored
parasites lacking both genes. Parasites lacking pfhrp2 are present in Kenya, but 
may be detectable by HRP-based RDT at higher parasitaemia, possibly due to the
presence of intact pfhrp3. These findings warrant further systematic study to
establish prevalence and diagnostic significance.
