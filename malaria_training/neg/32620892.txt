The genomes of Plasmodium spp. encode a number of different multigene families
that are thought to play a critical role for survival. However, with the
exception of the P. falciparum var genes, very little is known about the
biological roles of any of the other multigene families. Using the recently
developed Selection Linked Integration method, we have been able to activate the 
expression of a single member of a multigene family of our choice in Plasmodium
spp. from its endogenous promoter. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach
by activating the expression of a unique var, rifin and stevor in P. falciparum
as well as yir in P. yoelii. Characterization of the selected parasites reveals
differences between the different families in terms of mutual exclusive control, 
co-regulation, and host adaptation. Our results further support the application
of the approach for the study of multigene families in Plasmodium and other
organisms.
