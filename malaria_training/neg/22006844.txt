We have investigated the DNA-binding nature as well as the function of a putative
Alba (Acetylation lowers binding affinity) family protein (PfAlba3) from
Plasmodium falciparum. PfAlba3 possesses DNA-binding property like Alba family
proteins. PfAlba3 binds to DNA sequence non-specifically at the minor groove and 
acetylation lowers its DNA-binding affinity. The protein is ubiquitously
expressed in all the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum and it exists
predominantly in the acetylated form. PfAlba3 inhibits transcription in vitro by 
binding to DNA. Plasmodium falciparum Sir2 (PfSir2A), a nuclear localized
deacetylase interacts with PfAlba3 and deacetylates the lysine residue of
N-terminal peptide of PfAlba3 specific for DNA binding. PfAlba3 is localized with
PfSir2A in the periphery of the nucleus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
studies revealed the presence of PfAlba3 in the telomeric and subtelomeric
regions. ChIP and ChIP ReChIP analyses further confirmed that PfAlba3 binds to
the telomeric and subtelomeric regions as well as to var gene promoter.
