BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular basis of insecticide resistance is key to
improve the surveillance and monitoring of malaria vector populations under
control. In the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus, little is currently
known about the role of the knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism. Here, we
investigated the presence and contribution of knockdown resistance (kdr) to
pyrethroids/DDT resistance observed in Anopheles funestus across Africa.
RESULTS: Pyrosequencing genotyping and sequencing of the voltage gated sodium
channel (VGSC) gene did not detect the common L1014F mutation in field collected 
An. funestus across Africa. Amplification and cloning of the full-length of the
sodium channel gene in pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes revealed evidences of
alternative splicing events with three transcripts of 2092, 2061 and 2117 amino
acids (93% average similarity to An. gambiae). Several amino acid changes were
detected close to the domain II of the protein such as L928R, F938 W, I939S,
L802S and T1008 M. However, all these mutations are found at low frequency and
their role in pyrethroid resistance could not be established. The presence of the
exclusive alternative splicing at exon 19 was not associated with resistance
phenotype. Analysis of patterns of genetic diversity of the VGSC gene revealed a 
high polymorphism level of this gene across Africa with no evidence of
directional selection suggesting a limited role for knockdown resistance in
pyrethroid resistance in An. funestus. Patterns of genetic differentiation
correlate with previous observations of the existence of barriers to gene flow
Africa-wide with southern population significantly differentiated from other
regions.
CONCLUSION: Despite an apparent limited role of knockdown resistance in An.
funestus, it is necessary to continue to monitor the contribution of the
mutations detected here as increasing selection from insecticide-based
interventions may change the dynamic in field populations as previously observed 
in other vectors.
