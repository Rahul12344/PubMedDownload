Little is known about the role of the three Jumonji C (JmjC) enzymes in
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Here, we show that JIB-04 and other established
inhibitors of mammalian JmjC histone demethylases kill asexual blood stage
parasites and are even more potent at blocking gametocyte development and gamete 
formation. In late stage parasites, JIB-04 increased levels of trimethylated
lysine residues on histones, suggesting the inhibition of P. falciparum Jumonji
demethylase activity. These epigenetic defects coincide with deregulation of
invasion, cell motor, and sexual development gene programs, including gene
targets coregulated by the PfAP2-I transcription factor and chromatin-binding
factor, PfBDP1. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PfJmj3 converts
2-oxoglutarate to succinate in an iron-dependent manner consistent with mammalian
Jumonji enzymes, and this catalytic activity is inhibited by JIB-04 and other
Jumonji inhibitors. Our pharmacological studies of Jumonji activity in the
malaria parasite provide evidence that inhibition of these enzymatic activities
is detrimental to the parasite.
