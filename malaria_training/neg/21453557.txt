The ability to analyze gene function in malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites has 
received a boost with a recent paper in BMC Genomics that describes a genome-wide
mutagenesis system in the rodent malaria species Plasmodium berghei using the
transposon piggyBac. This advance holds promise for identifying and validating
new targets for intervention against malaria. But further improvements are still 
needed for the full power of genome-wide molecular genetic screens to be utilized
in this organism.See research article:
