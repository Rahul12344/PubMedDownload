BACKGROUND: Molecular genotyping in Plasmodium serves many aims including
providing tools for studying parasite population genetics and distinguishing
recrudescence from reinfection. Microsatellite typing, insertion-deletion (INDEL)
and single nucleotide polymorphisms is used for genotyping, but only limited
information is available for Plasmodium malariae, an important human malaria
species. This study aimed to provide a set of genetic markers to facilitate the
study of P. malariae population genetics.
METHODS: Markers for microsatellite genotyping and pmmsp1 gene polymorphisms were
developed and validated in symptomatic P. malariae field isolates from Myanmar
(N = 37). Fragment analysis was used to determine allele sizes at each locus to
calculate multiplicity of infections (MOI), linkage disequilibrium,
heterozygosity and construct dendrograms. Nucleotide diversity (π), number of
haplotypes, and genetic diversity (Hd) were assessed and a phylogenetic tree was 
constructed. Genome-wide microsatellite maps with annotated regions of newly
identified markers were constructed.
RESULTS: Six microsatellite markers were developed and tested in 37 P. malariae
isolates which showed sufficient heterozygosity (0.530-0.922), and absence of
linkage disequilibrium (IAS=0.03, p value > 0.05) (N = 37). In addition, a tandem
repeat (VNTR)-based pmmsp1 INDEL polymorphisms marker was developed and assessed 
in 27 P. malariae isolates showing a nucleotide diversity of 0.0976, haplotype
gene diversity of 0.698 and identified 14 unique variants. The size of VNTR
consensus repeat unit adopted as allele was 27 base pairs. The markers Pm12_426
and pmmsp1 showed greatest diversity with heterozygosity scores of 0.920 and
0.835, respectively. Using six microsatellites markers, the likelihood that any
two parasite strains would have the same microsatellite genotypes was 8.46 × 10-4
and was further reduced to 1.66 × 10-4 when pmmsp1 polymorphisms were included.
CONCLUSIONS: Six novel microsatellites genotyping markers and a set of pmmsp1
VNTR-based INDEL polymorphisms markers for P. malariae were developed and
validated. Each marker could be independently or in combination employed to
access genotyping of the parasite. The newly developed markers may serve as a
useful tool for investigating parasite diversity, population genetics, molecular 
epidemiology and for distinguishing recrudescence from reinfection in drug
efficacy studies.
