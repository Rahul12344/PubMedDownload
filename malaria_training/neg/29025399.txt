BACKGROUND: Expression of group A and the A-like subset of group B Plasmodium
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is associated with severe
malaria (SM). The diversity of var sequences combined with the challenges of
distinct classification of patient pathologies has made studying the role of
distinct PfEMP1 variants on malaria disease severity challenging. The application
of retinopathy in the recent years has provided a further method to clinically
evaluate children with cerebral malaria (CM). The question of whether children
with clinical CM but no retinopathy represent a completely different disease
process or a subgroup within the spectrum of CM remains an important question in 
malaria. In the current study, we use newly designed primer sets with the best
coverage to date in a large cohort of children with SM to determine the role of
var genes in malaria disease severity and especially CM as discriminated by
retinopathy.
METHODS: We performed qRT-PCR targeting the different subsets of these var genes 
on samples from Ugandan children with CM (n = 98, of whom 50 had malarial
retinopathy [RP] and 47 did not [RN]), severe malarial anemia (SMA, n = 47), and 
asymptomatic parasitemia (AP, n = 14). The primers used in this study were
designed based on var sequences from 226 Illumina whole genome sequenced P.
falciparum field isolates.
RESULTS: Increasing severity of illness was associated with increasing levels of 
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding PfEMP1. EPCR-binding PfEMP1
transcript levels were highest in children with combined CM and SMA and then
decreased by level of disease severity: RP CM > RN CM > SMA > AP.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that PfEMP1 binding to EPCR is important
in the pathogenesis of SM, including RN CM, and suggest that increased expression
of EPCR-binding PfEMP1 is associated with progressively more severe disease.
Agents that block EPCR-binding of PfEMP1 could provide novel interventions to
prevent or decrease disease severity in malaria.
