Many chronic infections, including malaria and HIV, are associated with a large
expansion of CD21-CD27- 'atypical' memory B cells (MBCs) that exhibit reduced B
cell receptor (BCR) signaling and effector functions. Little is known about the
conditions or transcriptional regulators driving atypical MBC differentiation.
Here we show that atypical MBCs in malaria-exposed individuals highly express the
transcription factor T-bet, and that T-bet expression correlates inversely with
BCR signaling and skews toward IgG3 class switching. Moreover, a longitudinal
analysis of a subset of children suggested a correlation between the incidence of
febrile malaria and the expansion of T-bethi B cells. The Th1-cytokine containing
supernatants of malaria-stimulated PBMCs plus BCR cross linking induced T-bet
expression in naïve B cells that was abrogated by neutralizing IFN-γ or blocking 
the IFN-γ receptor on B cells. Accordingly, recombinant IFN-γ plus BCR
cross-linking drove T-bet expression in peripheral and tonsillar B cells.
Consistent with this, Th1-polarized Tfh (Tfh-1) cells more efficiently induced
T-bet expression in naïve B cells. These data provide new insight into the
mechanisms underlying atypical MBC differentiation.
