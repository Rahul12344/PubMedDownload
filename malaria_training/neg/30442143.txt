BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria is characterized by relapses arising from
the hypnozoite stages in the liver. The only currently registered drug for
radical treatment to prevent relapse is primaquine. Primaquine, a prodrug,
requires metabolism through the liver cytochrome CYP2D6 isoenzyme to its active
metabolite. Mutations in the CYP2D6 gene may thus affect primaquine efficacy. A
SNPs genotyping technique was developed to characterize the CYP2D6 genetic
variants and tested this in the patients with Plasmodium vivax infection
collected in a Karen population on the Thailand-Myanmar border, where P. vivax
malaria is endemic.
METHODS: Direct sequencing of PCR-reamplified products (DSP) was used to uncover 
exonic CYP2D6 sequence variations. Subsequently, an allele-specific
oligonucleotide probe real-time SNPs genotyping (ASO) assay was developed for
rapid detection of the four clinically relevant CYP2D6 variants occurring in this
population. These two in-house developed assays were used to genotype CYP2D6
mutations in blood samples obtained from 70 Karen adults.
RESULTS: Results showed a high degree of concordance between the DSP and ASO
methods. Six CYP2D6 point mutations were identified within the Karen population: 
C100T, C1039T, G1661C, G1846A, C2850T and G4180C, at frequencies of 0.43, 0.43,
0.76, 0.02, 0.32 and 0.76, respectively. The CYP2D6*2, *4, *5, *10 and *36
allelic frequencies were 0.33, 0.02, 0.03, 0.40 and 0.01, respectively. Alleles
conferring an intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype comprised 46% of the
total number of alleles.
CONCLUSION: The newly developed ASO assay is a reliable and rapid tool for
large-scale CYP2D6 genotyping. The high frequency of the CYP2D6*10 allele in the 
Karen population warrants further assessment of its association with the radical 
curative efficacy of primaquine.
