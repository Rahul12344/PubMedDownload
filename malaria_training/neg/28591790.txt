Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymatic 
disorder in humans and appears to be protective against falciparum severe
malaria. Controversially, it is also thought that Plasmodium vivax has driven the
recent selection of G6PD alleles. We use an experimental approach to determine
whether G6PD-MahidolG487A variant, a widespread cause of severe G6PD deficiency
in Southeast Asia, provides a barrier against vivax malaria. Our results show
that the immature reticulocytes (CD71+) targeted by P. vivax invasion are
enzymatically normal, even in hemizygous G6PD-Mahidol G487A mutants; thus,
allowing the normal growth, development, and high parasite density in severely
deficient samples.
