DNA of malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, is subjected to extraordinary
high levels of genotoxic insults during its complex life cycle within both the
mosquito and human host. Accordingly, most of the components of DNA repair
machinery are conserved in the parasite genome. Here, we investigated the
genome-wide responses of P. falciparum to DNA damaging agents and provided
transcriptional evidence of the existence of the double strand break and excision
repair system. We also showed that acetylation at H3K9, H4K8, and H3K56 play a
role in the direct and indirect response to DNA damage induced by an alkylating
agent, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). Artemisinin, the first line antimalarial
chemotherapeutics elicits a similar response compared to MMS which suggests its
activity as a DNA damaging agent. Moreover, in contrast to the wild-type P.
falciparum, two strains (Dd2 and W2) previously shown to exhibit a mutator
phenotype, fail to induce their DNA repair upon MMS-induced DNA damage. Genome
sequencing of the two mutator strains identified point mutations in 18 DNA repair
genes which may contribute to this phenomenon.
