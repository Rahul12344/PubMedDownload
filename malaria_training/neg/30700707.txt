The exoerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium infection is a critical window for
prophylactic intervention. Using genome-wide dual RNA sequencing of flow-sorted
infected and uninfected hepatoma cells we show that the human mucosal immunity
gene, mucin-13 (MUC13), is strongly upregulated during Plasmodium exoerythrocytic
hepatic-stage infection. We confirm MUC13 transcript increases in hepatoma cell
lines and primary hepatocytes. In immunofluorescence assays, host MUC13 protein
expression distinguishes infected cells from adjacent uninfected cells and shows 
similar colocalization with parasite biomarkers such as UIS4 and HSP70. We
further show that localization patterns are species independent, marking both P. 
berghei and P. vivax infected cells, and that MUC13 can be used to identify
compounds that inhibit parasite replication in hepatocytes. This data provides
insights into host-parasite interactions in Plasmodium infection, and
demonstrates that a component of host mucosal immunity is reprogrammed during the
progression of infection.
