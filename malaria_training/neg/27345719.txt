The application of next-generation sequencing to estimate genetic diversity of
Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria parasite, has proved challenging
due to the skewed AT-richness [∼80.6% (A + T)] of its genome and the lack of
technology to assemble highly polymorphic subtelomeric regions that contain
clonally variant, multigene virulence families (Ex: var and rifin). To address
this, we performed amplification-free, single molecule, real-time sequencing of
P. falciparum genomic DNA and generated reads of average length 12 kb, with 50%
of the reads between 15.5 and 50 kb in length. Next, using the Hierarchical
Genome Assembly Process, we assembled the P. falciparum genome de novo and
successfully compiled all 14 nuclear chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We also
accurately resolved centromeres [∼90-99% (A + T)] and subtelomeric regions and
identified large insertions and duplications that add extra var and rifin genes
to the genome, along with smaller structural variants such as homopolymer tract
expansions. Overall, we show that amplification-free, long-read sequencing
combined with de novo assembly overcomes major challenges inherent to studying
the P. falciparum genome. Indeed, this technology may not only identify the
polymorphic and repetitive subtelomeric sequences of parasite populations from
endemic areas but may also evaluate structural variation linked to virulence,
drug resistance and disease transmission.
