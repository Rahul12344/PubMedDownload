BACKGROUND: Although Plasmodium vivax contributes to almost half of all malaria
cases outside Africa, it has been relatively neglected compared to the more
deadly P. falciparum. It is known that P. vivax populations possess high genetic 
diversity, differing geographically potentially due to different vector species, 
host genetics and environmental factors.
RESULTS: We analysed the high-quality genomic data for 46 P. vivax isolates
spanning 10 countries across 4 continents. Using population genetic methods we
identified hotspots of selection pressure, including the previously reported MRP1
and DHPS genes, both putative drug resistance loci. Extra copies and deletions in
the promoter region of another drug resistance candidate, MDR1 gene, and
duplications in the Duffy binding protein gene (PvDBP) potentially involved in
erythrocyte invasion, were also identified. For surveillance applications,
continental-informative markers were found in putative drug resistance loci, and 
we show that organellar polymorphisms could classify P. vivax populations across 
continents and differentiate between Plasmodia spp.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that genomic diversity that lies within and
between P. vivax populations can be used to elucidate potential drug resistance
and invasion mechanisms, as well as facilitate the molecular barcoding of the
parasite for surveillance applications.
