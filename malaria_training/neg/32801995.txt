Background: Cerebral malaria (CM), a reversible encephalopathy affecting young
children, is a medical emergency requiring rapid clinical assessment and
treatment. However, understanding of the genes/proteins and the biological
pathways involved in the disease outcome is still limited.
Methods: We have performed a whole transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from 
Malian children with CM or uncomplicated malaria (UM). Hierarchical clustering
and pathway, network, and upstream regulator analyses were performed to explore
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We validated gene expression for 8 genes
using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Plasma levels were measured for
IP-10/CXCL10 and IL-18.
Results: A blood RNA signature including 538 DEGs (∣FC | ≥2.0, adjusted P value ≤
0.01) allowed to discriminate between CM and UM. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed novel genes and
biological pathways related to immune/inflammatory responses, erythrocyte
alteration, and neurodegenerative disorders. Gene expressions of CXCL10, IL12RB2,
IL18BP, IL2RA, AXIN2, and NET were significantly lower in CM whereas ARG1 and
SLC6A9 were higher in CM compared to UM. Plasma protein levels of IP-10/CXCL10
were significantly lower in CM than in UM while levels of IL-18 were higher.
Interestingly, among children with CM, those who died from a complication of
malaria tended to have higher concentrations of IP-10/CXCL10 and IFN-γ than those
who recovered.
Conclusions: This study identified some new factors and mechanisms that play
crucial roles in CM and characterized their respective biological pathways as
well as some upstream regulators.
