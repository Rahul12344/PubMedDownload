Antibodies against the NANP repeat of circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major
surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites, can protect from
malaria in animal models but protective humoral immunity is difficult to induce
in humans. Here we cloned and characterized rare affinity-matured human
NANP-reactive memory B cell antibodies elicited by natural Pf exposure that
potently inhibited parasite transmission and development in vivo. We unveiled the
molecular details of antibody binding to two distinct protective epitopes within 
the NANP repeat. NANP repeat recognition was largely mediated by germline encoded
and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) 
residues, whereas affinity maturation contributed predominantly to stabilizing
the antigen-binding site conformation. Combined, our findings illustrate the
power of exploring human anti-CSP antibody responses to develop tools for malaria
control in the mammalian and the mosquito vector and provide a molecular basis
for the structure-based design of next-generation CSP malaria vaccines.
