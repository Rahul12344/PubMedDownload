The Arabian Peninsula (AP) was an important crossroad between Africa, Asia, and
Europe, being the cradle of the structure defining these main human population
groups, and a continuing path for their admixture. The screening of 741,000
variants in 420 Arabians and 80 Iranians allowed us to quantify the dominant
sub-Saharan African admixture in the west of the peninsula, whereas South Asian
and Levantine/European influence was stronger in the east, leading to a rift
between western and eastern sides of the Peninsula. Dating of the admixture
events indicated that Indian Ocean slave trade and Islamization periods were
important moments in the genetic makeup of the region. The western-eastern axis
was also observable in terms of positive selection of diversity conferring
lactose tolerance, with the West AP developing local adaptation and the East AP
acquiring the derived allele selected in European populations and existing in
South Asia. African selected malaria resistance through the DARC gene was
enriched in all Arabian genomes, especially in the western part. Clear European
influences associated with skin and eye color were equally frequent across the
Peninsula.
