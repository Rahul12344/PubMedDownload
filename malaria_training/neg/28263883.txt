The gold standard for malaria diagnosis is the microscopic examination of Giemsa 
stained thick blood smears though microscopy mostly may not detect the presence
of Plasmodium species infections in asymptomatic samples. In the reported study, 
we used two diagnostic methods viz. the conventional microscopic examination and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to analyse the asymptomatic malaria
samples. PCR assay amplifying 18S small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of 
Plasmodium in 122 samples confirmed 68% of isolates as asymptomatic P. falciparum
infections; with 87.9% mono-infections. We observed that the P. malariae positive
samples were not diagnosed in microscopic examination of the blood smears but the
PCR based diagnostic method revealed the presence of 12% P. malariae infections
in asymptomatic samples from Yaoundé region of Cameroon where no official cases
of P. malariae have been reported for over a decade. The sequence analysis
further confirmed the presence of 12% P. malariae in malaria positive samples
with three base pair deletions and five substitutions in the SSU rRNA gene.
