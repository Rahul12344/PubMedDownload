INTRODUCTION: The importance of Plasmodium vivax in malaria elimination is
increasingly being recognized, yet little is known about its population size and 
population genetic structure in the South Pacific, an area that is the focus of
intensified malaria control.
METHODS: We have genotyped 13 microsatellite markers in 295 P. vivax isolates
from four geographically distinct sites in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and one site
from Solomon Islands, representing different transmission intensities.
RESULTS: Diversity was very high with expected heterozygosity values ranging from
0.62 to 0.98 for the different markers. Effective population size was high
(12'872 to 19'533 per site). In PNG population structuring was limited with
moderate levels of genetic differentiation. F ST values (adjusted for high
diversity of markers) were 0.14-0.15. Slightly higher levels were observed
between PNG populations and Solomon Islands (F ST = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of population structure despite geographical barriers to 
transmission are in sharp contrast to results from regions of low P. vivax
endemicity. Prior to intensification of malaria control programs in the study
area, parasite diversity and effective population size remained high.
