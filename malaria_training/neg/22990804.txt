The attenuation of Plasmodium parasites by either radiation or targeted gene
deletion can result in viable sporozoites that invade the liver and subsequently 
arrest. The death of the growth-arrested liver stage parasite and the ensuing
recognition by the immune system of parasite antigens promotes protective
immunity in immunized mice and humans. The methods described below will enable
researchers to determine the efficacy of radiation-attenuated and genetically
attenuated rodent malaria sporozoite immunizations against infectious sporozoite 
challenge, and study protective immunity in immunized mice. In addition, by
determining the time of arrest of genetically attenuated parasite liver stages
and the mechanisms of clearance, researchers will be able to correlate biological
features of the growth-arrested parasites with their ability to promote
protective immunity.
