Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes transmit the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum, which causes the majority of fatal malaria cases worldwide. The
hematophagous lifestyle defines mosquito reproductive biology and is exploited by
P. falciparum for its own sexual reproduction and transmission. The two main
phases of the mosquito reproductive cycle, previtellogenic (PV) and postblood
meal (PBM), shape its capacity to transmit malaria. Transition between these
phases is tightly coordinated to ensure homeostasis between mosquito tissues and 
successful reproduction. One layer of control is provided by microRNAs (miRNAs), 
well-known regulators of blood meal digestion and egg development in Aedes
mosquitoes. Here, we report a global overview of tissue-specific miRNAs (miRNA)
expression during the PV and PBM phases and identify miRNAs regulated during PV
to PBM transition. The observed coordinated changes in the expression levels of a
set of miRNAs in the energy-storing tissues suggest a role in the regulation of
blood meal-induced metabolic changes.
