BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum parasites, which could harbour anti-malaria
drug resistance genes, are commonly detected in blood donors in malaria-endemic
areas. Notwithstanding, anti-malaria drug resistant biomarkers have not been
characterized in blood donors with asymptomatic P. falciparum infection.
METHODS: A total of 771 blood donors were selected from five districts in the
Greater Accra Region, Ghana. Each donor sample was screened with malaria rapid
diagnostic test (RDT) kit and parasitaemia quantified microscopically. Dried
blood spots from malaria positive samples were genotyped for P. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), P. falciparum multi-drug resistance
(Pfmdr1), P. falciparum dihydropteroate-synthetase (Pfdhps), P. falciparum
dihydrofolate-reductase (Pfdhfr) and Kelch 13 propeller domain on chromosome 13
(Kelch 13) genes.
RESULTS: Of the 771 blood donors, 91 (11.8%) were positive by RDT. Analysis of
sequence reads indicated successful genotyping of Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps
and Kelch 13 genes in 84.6, 81.3, 86.8, 86.9 and 92.3% of the isolates
respectively. Overall, 21 different mutant haplotypes were identified in 69
isolates (75.8%). In Pfcrt, CVIET haplotype was observed in 11.6% samples while
in Pfmdr1, triple mutation (resulting in YFN haplotype) was detected in 8.1% of
isolates. In Pfdhfr gene, triple mutation resulting in IRNI haplotype and in
Pfdhps gene, quintuple mutation resulting in AGESS haplotype was identified in
17.7% parasite isolates. Finally, five non-synonymous Kelch 13 alleles were
detected; C580Y (3.6%), P615L (4.8%), A578S (4.8%), I543V (2.4%) and A676S (1.2%)
were detected.
CONCLUSION: Results obtained in this study indicated various frequencies of
mutant alleles in Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps and Kelch 13 genes from P.
falciparum infected blood donors. These alleles could reduce the efficacy of
standard malaria treatment in transfusion-transmitted malaria cases.
Incorporating malaria screening into donor screening protocol to defer infected
donors is therefore recommended.
