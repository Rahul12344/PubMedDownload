BACKGROUND: Covid-19 morbidity and mortality are associated with a dysregulated
immune response. Tools are needed to enhance existing immune profiling
capabilities in affected patients. Here we aimed to develop an approach to
support the design of targeted blood transcriptome panels for profiling the
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: We designed a pool of candidates based on a pre-existing and
well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional modules. Available
Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process. Further
selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several
custom web applications to support the evaluation of candidates.
RESULTS: As a proof of principle, we designed three targeted blood transcript
panels, each with a different translational connotation: immunological relevance,
therapeutic development relevance and SARS biology relevance.
CONCLUSION: Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future
expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood
transcript abundance in Covid-19 patients.
