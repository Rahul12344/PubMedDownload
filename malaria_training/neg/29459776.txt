Naturally acquired antibodies to proteins expressed on the Plasmodium falciparum 
parasitized red blood cell (pRBC) surface steer the course of a malaria infection
by reducing sequestration and stimulating phagocytosis of pRBC. Here we have
studied a selection of proteins representing three different parasite gene
families employing a well-characterized parasite with a severe malaria phenotype 
(FCR3S1.2). The presence of naturally acquired antibodies, impact on rosetting
rate, surface reactivity and opsonization for phagocytosis in relation to
different blood groups of the ABO system were assessed in a set of sera from
children with mild or complicated malaria from an endemic area. We show that the 
naturally acquired immune responses, developed during malaria natural infection, 
have limited access to the pRBCs inside a blood group A rosette. The data also
indicate that SURFIN4.2 may have a function at the pRBC surface, particularly
during rosette formation, this role however needs to be further validated. Our
results also indicate epitopes differentially recognized by rosette-disrupting
antibodies on a peptide array. Antibodies towards parasite-derived proteins such 
as PfEMP1, RIFIN and SURFIN in combination with host factors, essentially the ABO
blood group of a malaria patient, are suggested to determine the outcome of a
malaria infection.
