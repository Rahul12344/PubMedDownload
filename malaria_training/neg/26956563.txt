β-Thalassemia (β-thal) is considered rare in Central Europe. As in other
malaria-free regions, the presence of β-thal in Central Europe reflects
historical and recent immigration, and demographic changes that have influenced
the genetic variability of the current populations living in this area. This
study assesses the frequency and spectrum of mutations on the β-globin gene in
Czech and Slovak subjects with clinical symptoms of thalassemia. The results of
the initial part of this research were published more than two decades ago; the
aim of this study was to update these original reports. During the period from
2002 to 2015, 400 cases from Czech and Slovak hematological centers were
analyzed. Twenty-nine β-thal mutations, identified in 356 heterozygotes from 218 
unrelated families, involve five unique mutations including a recently described 
insertion of a transposable L1 element into the β-globin gene. One mutation
described here is reported for the first time. Most of the mutations were of
Mediterranean origin and accounted for 82.0% of cases. All but one case studied
were heterozygous carriers, manifesting β-thal minor, with rare exceptions
represented by the rare (β(0)) codons 46/47 (+G) (HBB: c.142_142dupG) mutation
associated with an α-globin gene quadruplication and by dominantly inherited
β-thal with a more severe phenotype. One double heterozygous β-thal patient was a
recent immigrant from Moldavia. The list of δβ-thal alleles (26 carriers, 16
families) contains Hb Lepore and two types of δβ(0)-thal deletions. In the past, 
genetic drift and migration as well as recent immigrations were responsible for
the introduction of Mediterranean alleles, while several mutations described in
single families were of local origin.
