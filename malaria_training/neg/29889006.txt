Avian blood parasites, including Plasmodium spp. and Haemoproteus spp., are found
worldwide but only limited information of their occurrence is available in the
Republic of Korea (ROK). We determined the prevalence of Plasmodium and
Haemoproteus and their phylogenetic characteristics in wild birds in ROK. Blood
samples were collected from 118 wild birds of 27 species in the Chonbuk Province,
ROK. While 43 (36%) were positive for avian haemosporidia on microscopic
examination of blood smears, 53 (45%) were positive by PCR targeting the
cytochrome b gene. By direct sequencing of PCR amplicons, 47 (89%) were
identified as Haemoproteus spp. and 6 (11%) as Plasmodium spp. Phylogenetic
analysis using the cytochrome b gene revealed that resident and migrant birds
have very similar genetic lineages of both parasites in ROK, suggesting the
possibility that migrant birds may act as a mediator for the parasite among Asian
countries.
