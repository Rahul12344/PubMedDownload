An essential component of malaria vector control programmes is the detection of
Plasmodium falciparum within its mosquito vectors, particularly in the salivary
glands where the infective sporozoites reside. Several protocols have been
developed for this purpose; however they require dissection of mosquito specimens
prior to analysis. Here, a novel one-step RT-qPCR TaqMan diagnostic assay was
developed for mosquitoes with infective Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in the 
salivary glands. It is based on detection of the sporozoite-specific Pfslarp and 
Pfplp1 gene transcripts. These transcripts were chosen based on bioinformatics
analysis, and experimentally verified to be overexpressed in the salivary gland
sporozoite stage of the parasite compared to other mosquito parasite stages. The 
proof of principle and the performance of the assay were demonstrated using
RNAlater preserved mosquito samples. Tests of analytical sensitivity showed the
novel TaqMan assay to be 100% accurate, although its performance in the field
needs to be further demonstrated. This method has no requirement for dissection
and post-PCR processing and thus is simple and rapid to perform in individual
mosquitoes or mosquito pools. It can be used in single or multiplex formats also 
targeting additional markers expressed in different tissues, such as
detoxification enzymes associated with insecticide resistance.
