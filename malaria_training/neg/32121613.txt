Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily
conserved catabolic process whose loss-of-function has been linked to a growing
list of pathologies. Knockout mouse models of key autophagy genes have been
instrumental in the demonstration of the critical functions of autophagy, but
they display early lethality, neurotoxicity and unwanted autophagy-independent
phenotypes, limiting their applications for in vivo studies. To avoid problems
encountered with autophagy-null transgenic mice, we investigated the possibility 
of disturbing autophagy pharmacologically in the long term. Hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) ip injections were done in juvenile and adult C57bl/6j mice, at range doses
adapted from the human malaria prophylactic treatment. The impact on autophagy
was assessed by western-blotting, and juvenile neurodevelopment and adult
behaviours were evaluated for four months. Quite surprisingly, our results showed
that HCQ treatment in conditions used in this study neither impacted autophagy in
the long term in several tissues and organs nor altered neurodevelopment, adult
behaviour and motor capabilities. Therefore, we recommend for future long-term in
vivo studies of autophagy, to use genetic mouse models allowing conditional
inhibition of selected Atg genes in appropriate lineage cells instead of HCQ
treatment, until it could be successfully revisited using higher HCQ doses and/or
frequencies with acceptable toxicity.
