The saliva of ticks is critical to their survival as parasites and hematophagous 
animals. In this study, we have purified an enzyme with trypsin-like activity
from the saliva of the tick vector of Lyme Disease, Ixodes scapularis. This
enzyme, named as IXOSP (I. scapularis salivary serine protease), is a 29.9 kDa
molecule with N-terminus FPxMVxLRIKxR. A BLAST search identified IXOSP as a
secreted serine protease (AAY66740) with a conserved catalytic triad His, Asp,
and Ser. In vitro studies demonstrated that IXOSP cleaves chromogenic substrates 
with arginine in the P1 position, by a mechanism inhibited by PMSF or aprotinin. 
Gene expression studies revealed that IXOSP is expressed at different tick
developmental stages, including eggs, and unfed or fed adult tick salivary
glands, but not in nymphs or in the midgut. While the physiological substrate for
IXOSP remains to be identified, we demonstrated that I. scapularis saliva
activate protein C (PC) resulting in the production of activated PC, a potent
anticoagulant that also regulates a myriad of inflammatory responses through
protease activated receptors. In contrast, the salivary glands of Anopheles
gambiae, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles albimanus, Aedes aegypti, Lutzomyia
longipalpis, and Phlebotomus ariasi did not activate protein C. These discoveries
are discussed in the context of blood coagulation, inflammation and vector-host
interactions.
