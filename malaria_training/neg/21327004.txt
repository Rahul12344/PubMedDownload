BACKGROUND: Antimalarial drug resistance has been a major contributor to the
failure of the battle against malaria in many developing countries. The P.
falciparum genes, pfcrt and pfmdr-1, have been implicated in chloroquine
resistance. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of mutant
alleles of these chloroquine resistance genes among isolates of P. falciparum
from children presenting with severe malaria in Ghana.
METHODS: Venous blood samples were taken from patients, and plasma chloroquine
levels measured. P. falciparum chromosomal DNA was isolated from the blood
samples, and subjected to PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing. Resulting
data were analysed using the STATA statistical software.
RESULTS: Of 140 children recruited into the study, 109 (77.9%) had detectable
pre-treatment chloroquine levels. PCR and restriction digestion analysis of the
pfcrt gene indicated that 124 (88.6%) had the mutant T76 gene, and that this
correlated with higher chloroquine levels. Sequence analysis of these showed
consistent genetic sequences for chloroquine resistant and sensitive parasites
with respect to Pfcrt codons 72 through 76.The Pfcrt T76 mutation was found in
88.4% of isolates having the Pfmdr-1Y86 mutation. The Pfmdr-1 Y86 mutation was
found in 67.6% of isolates having the Pfcrt T76 mutation.
CONCLUSION: The study affirms Pfcrt as a better chloroquine resistance marker.
Both mutations are independently selected by chloroquine levels and that one
mutation (Y86) might modify/increase the effect of the other (T76). This study
also depicts the much-overlooked antimalarial drug resistance situation in the
area and emphasizes the need for a proper treatment strategy.
