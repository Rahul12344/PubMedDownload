Artemisinins are widely used to treat Plasmodium infections due to their high
clinical efficacy; however, the antimalarial mechanism of artemisinin remains
unresolved. Mutations in P. falciparum ATPase6 (PfATP6), a sarcoplasmic
endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-transporting ATPase, are associated with increased
tolerance to artemisinin. We utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to
examine the involvement of Pmr1p, a functional homolog of PfATP6, on the toxicity
of artemisinin. Our analysis demonstrated that cells lacking Pmr1p are less
susceptible to growth inhibition from artemisinin and its derivatives. No
association between sensitivity to artemisinin and altered trafficking of the
drug efflux pump Pdr5p, calcium homeostasis, or protein glycosylation was found
in pmr1∆ yeast. Basal ROS levels are elevated in pmr1∆ yeast and artemisinin
exposure does not enhance ROS accumulation. This is in contrast to WT cells that 
exhibit a significant increase in ROS production following treatment with
artemisinin. Yeast deleted for PMR1 are known to accumulate excess manganese ions
that can function as ROS-scavenging molecules, but no correlation between
manganese content and artemisinin resistance was observed. We propose that loss
of function mutations in Pmr1p in yeast cells and PfATP6 in P. falciparum are
protective against artemisinin toxicity due to reduced intracellular oxidative
damage.
