BACKGROUND: Malaria surveillance requires powerful tools and strategies to
achieve malaria elimination. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (RDTs) are easily
deployed on a large scale and are helpful sources of parasite DNA. The
application of sensitive molecular techniques to these RDTs is a modern tool for 
improving malaria case detection and drug resistance surveillance. Several
studies have made it possible to extract the DNA of Plasmodium falciparum from
RDTs. The knowledge of gametocyte carriage in the population is important to
better assess the level of parasite transmission in elimination settings. The aim
of this study was to detect P. falciparum gametocytes from used RDTs by
quantitative PCR for molecular monitoring of malaria transmission.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 303 RDT devices (SD Bioline Malaria Pf) using the
Chelex-100 protocol. qPCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction to detect and
quantify transcripts of the pfs25 gene. The cycle threshold (Ct) was determined
by the emission fluorescence corresponding to the initial amount of amplified
DNA.
RESULTS: The study found an overall prevalence of 53.47% with an average Ct of
32.12 ± 4.28 cycles. In 2018, the prevalence of gametocytes was higher in the
Ranérou district (76.24%) than in the Saint-Louis district (67.33%) where an
increase in the number of gametocyte carriers in 2018 was noted, in comparison
with 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: RDTs are a good source of DNA for molecular monitoring of gametocyte
carriage. This method is a simple and effective tool to better understand the
level of malaria transmission with a view to elimination.
