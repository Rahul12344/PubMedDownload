Inversion polymorphisms are responsible for many ecologically important
phenotypes and are often found under balancing selection. However, the same
features that ensure their large role in local adaptation-especially reduced
recombination between alternate arrangements-mean that uncovering the precise
loci within inversions that control these phenotypes is unachievable using
standard mapping approaches. Here, we take advantage of long-term balancing
selection on a pair of inversions in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae to map
desiccation tolerance via pool-GWAS. Two polymorphic inversions on chromosome 2
of this species (denoted 2La and 2Rb) are associated with arid and hot conditions
in Africa and are maintained in spatially and temporally heterogeneous
environments. After measuring thousands of wild-caught individuals for survival
under desiccation stress, we used phenotypically extreme individuals homozygous
for alternative arrangements at the 2La inversion to construct pools for
whole-genome sequencing. Genomewide association mapping using these pools
revealed dozens of significant SNPs within both 2La and 2Rb, many of which
neighboured genes controlling ion channels or related functions. Our results
point to the promise of similar approaches in systems with inversions maintained 
by balancing selection and provide a list of candidate genes underlying the
specific phenotypes controlled by the two inversions studied here.
