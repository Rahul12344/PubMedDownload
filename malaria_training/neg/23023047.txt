In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the major determinant of
chloroquine resistance, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt),
likely plays an essential role in asexual blood stages, thus precluding
conventional gene targeting approaches. We attempted to conditionally silence the
expression of its ortholog in Plasmodium berghei (pbcrt) through Flp
recombinase-mediated excision of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) during mosquito 
passage. However, parasites maintained pbcrt expression despite 3'UTR excision.
Characterisation of these pbcrt mRNAs, by 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends,
identified several replacement 3'UTR sequences. Our observations demonstrate the 
astounding genetic plasticity of this parasite when faced with the loss of an
essential gene.
