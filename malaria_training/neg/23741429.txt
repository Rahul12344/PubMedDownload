It was in Freetown, Sierra Leone, that the malaria mosquito Anopheles coastalis, 
now known as Anopheles gambiae, was first discovered as the vector of malaria, in
1899. That discovery led to a pioneering vector research in Sierra Leone and
neighbouring Liberia, where mosquito species were extensively characterized.
Unfortunately, the decade long civil conflicts of the 1990s, in both countries,
resulted in a stagnation of the once vibrant research on disease vectors. This
paper attempts to fill in some of the gaps on what is now known of the
distribution of the sibling species of the An. gambiae complex, and especially
the An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s, formerly known as the An. gambiae molecular
M and S forms respectively, in the cities of Freetown and Monrovia.
