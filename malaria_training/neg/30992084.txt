BACKGROUND: Vector control remains the most important tool to prevent malaria
transmission. However, it is now severely constrained by the appearance of
physiological and behavioral insecticide resistance. Therefore, the development
of new vector control tools is warranted. Such tools could include immunization
of blood hosts of vector mosquitoes with mosquito proteins involved in midgut
homeostasis (anti-mosquito vaccines) or genetic engineering of mosquitoes that
can drive population-wide knockout of genes producing such proteins to reduce
mosquito lifespan and malaria transmission probability.
METHODS: To achieve this, candidate genes related to midgut homeostasis
regulation need to be assessed for their effect on mosquito survival. Here,
different such candidate genes were silenced through dsRNA injection in the
naturally occurring Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes and the effect on mosquito
survival was evaluated.
RESULTS: Significantly higher mortality rates were observed in the mosquitoes
silenced for FN3D1 (AARA003032), FN3D3 (AARA007751) and GPRGr9 (AARA003963) genes
as compared to the control group injected with dsRNA against a non-related
bacterial gene (LacZ). This observed difference in mortality rate between the
candidate genes and the control disappeared when gene-silenced mosquitoes were
treated with antibiotic mixtures, suggesting that gut microbiota play a key role 
in the observed reduction of mosquito survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that interference with the expression of the FN3D1, 
FN3D3 or GPRGr9 genes causes a significant reduction of the longevity of An.
arabiensis mosquito in the wild.
