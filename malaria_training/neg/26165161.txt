The insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and their respective signaling and regulatory
pathways are highly conserved across phyla. In invertebrates, ILPs regulate
diverse physiological processes, including metabolism, reproduction, behavior,
and immunity. We previously reported that blood feeding alone induced minimal
changes in ILP expression in Anopheles stephensi. However, ingestion of a blood
meal containing human insulin or Plasmodium falciparum, which can mimic insulin
signaling, leads to significant increases in ILP expression in the head and
midgut, suggesting a potential role for AsILPs in the regulation of P. falciparum
sporogonic development. Here, we show that soluble P. falciparum products, but
not LPS or zymosan, directly induced AsILP expression in immortalized A.
stephensi cells in vitro. Further, AsILP expression is dependent on signaling by 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt branches of the
insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Inhibition of P.
falciparum-induced ILPs in vivo decreased parasite development through
kinetically distinct effects on mosquito innate immune responses. Specifically,
knockdown of AsILP4 induced early expression of immune effector genes (1-6 h
after infection), a pattern associated with significantly reduced parasite
abundance prior to invasion of the midgut epithelium. In contrast, knockdown of
AsILP3 increased later expression of the same genes (24 h after infection), a
pattern that was associated with significantly reduced oocyst development. These 
data suggest that P. falciparum parasites alter the expression of mosquito AsILPs
to dampen the immune response and facilitate their development in the mosquito
vector.
