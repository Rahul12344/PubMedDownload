BACKGROUND: The increasing antimalarial drug resistance is a significant
hindrance to malaria control and elimination programs. For the last six decades, 
chloroquine (CQ) plus pyrimethamine remains the first-line treatment for P. vivax
malaria. Regions where both P. falciparum and P. vivax co-exist, P. vivax is
exposed to antifolate drugs due to either misdiagnosis or improper treatment that
causes selective drug pressure to evolve. Therefore, the present study aims to
estimate antimalarial drug resistance among the complicated and uncomplicated P. 
vivax patients.
METHODS: A total of 143 P. vivax malaria positive patients were enrolled in this 
study, and DNA was isolated from their blood samples. Pvcrt-o, Pvmdr-1, Pvdhps,
and Pvdhfr genes were PCRs amplified, and drug resistance-associated gene
mutations were analyzed. Statistical analysis of the drug resistance genes and
population diversity was performed using MEGA vs. 7.0.21 and DnaSP v software.
RESULTS: Among the CQ resistance marker gene Pvcrt-o, the prevalence of K10
insertion was 17.5% (7/40) and 9.5% (7/73) of complicated and uncomplicated P
vivax group isolates respectively. In Pvmdr-1, double mutant haplotype
(M958/L1076) was found in 99% of the clinical isolates. Among the pyrimethamine
resistance-associated gene Pvdhfr, the double mutant haplotype
I13P33F57R58T61N117I173 was detected in 23% (11/48) in complicated and 20%
(17/85) in uncomplicated group isolates. In the sulphadoxine
resistance-associated Pvdhps gene, limited polymorphism was observed with the
presence of a single mutant (D459A) among 16 and 5% of the clinical isolates in
the complicated and uncomplicated group respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study presents the situations of polymorphism in the antimalarial
drug resistance-associated genes and emphasizes the need for regular
surveillance. It is imperative for the development of suitable antimalarial drug 
policy in India.
