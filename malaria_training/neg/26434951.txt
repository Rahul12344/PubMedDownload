Widespread resistance to pyrethroids threatens malaria control in Africa.
Consequently, several countries switched to carbamates and organophophates
insecticides for indoor residual spraying. However, a mutation in the ace-1 gene 
conferring resistance to these compounds (ace-1(R) allele), is already present.
Furthermore, a duplicated allele (ace-1(D)) recently appeared; characterizing its
selective advantage is mandatory to evaluate the threat. Our data revealed that a
unique duplication event, pairing a susceptible and a resistant copy of the ace-1
gene spread through West Africa. Further investigations revealed that, while
ace-1(D) confers less resistance than ace-1(R), the high fitness cost associated 
with ace-1(R) is almost completely suppressed by the duplication for all traits
studied. ace-1 duplication thus represents a permanent heterozygote phenotype,
selected, and thus spreading, due to the mosaic nature of mosquito control. It
provides malaria mosquito with a new evolutionary path that could hamper
resistance management.
