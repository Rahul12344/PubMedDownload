Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an anti-Plasmodium component of platelets. It is
expressed in megakaryocytes and released from platelets following infection with 
Plasmodium Innate immunity is crucial for the host anti-Plasmodium response, in
which type I interferon plays an important role. Whether there is cross-talk
between innate immune signaling and the production of anti-Plasmodium defense
peptides is unknown. Here we demonstrate that E74, like ETS transcription factor 
4 (ELF4), a type I interferon activator, can help protect the host from
Plasmodium yoelii infection. Mechanically, ELF4 binds to the promoter of genes of
two C-X-C chemokines, Pf4 and pro-platelet basic protein (Ppbp), initiating the
transcription of these two genes, thereby enhancing PF4-mediated killing of
parasites from infected erythrocytes. Elf4 -/- mice are much more susceptible to 
Plasmodium infection than WT littermates. The expression level of Pf4 and Ppbp in
megakaryocytes from Elf4 -/- mice is much lower than in those from control
animals, resulting in increased parasitemia. In conclusion, our study uncovered a
distinct role of ELF4, an innate immune molecule, in host defense against
malaria.
