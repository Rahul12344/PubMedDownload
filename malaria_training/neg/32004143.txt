Background Marked differences among genotype frequencies (Caucasians, Asians, and
Africans) have been observed in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes. Data on the
frequency of pharmacogenetic relevant polymorphisms in Bhutanese population is
absent. This study aimed to investigate the frequencies of pharmacogenetic
relevant polymorphisms of CYP2C9 (*2 and *3), CYP2C19 (*2 and *3), CYP2D6 (*10), 
and CYP3A5 (*3) in Bhutanese population. Methods Genotyping was performed in 443 
DNA samples using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism. Results For CYP2C9, allele frequencies of *2 and *3 variants were
0.339% and 0%, respectively. For CYP2C19, frequencies of *2 and *3 variants were 
30.135% and 15.689%, respectively. Allele frequencies of CYP2D6*10 and CYP3A5*3
were 21.332% and 77.314%, respectively. Allele frequencies of CYP2C9*2 are
similar to most Asians while CYP2C9*3 was absent. CYP2C19*2 showed a close
resemblance to Japanese and Burmese, while CYP2C19*3 is near to Japanese and
Korean. CYP2D6*10 is noticeably lower than other Asians. CYP3A5*3 is similar to
East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Conclusions The Bhutanese population
is polymorphic for these CYP genes, except for CYP2C9*3. Similar to other
populations, genetic testing for these genes may, therefore, be helpful to obtain
the benefit from pharmacological treatments and prevent adverse drug reactions.
