Persistent or chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represents one
of the most common viral diseases in humans. The hepatitis B virus deploys the
hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) as a suppressor of host defenses consisting of 
RNAi-based silencing of viral genes. Because of its critical role in countering
host defenses, HBx represents an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Here, we 
developed and optimized a loss-of-function screening procedure, which identified 
a potential pharmacophore that abrogated HBx RNAi suppression activity. In a
survey of 14,400 compounds in the Maybridge Screening Collection, we prioritized 
candidate compounds via high-throughput screening based on reversal of green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-reported, RNAi-mediated silencing in a HepG2/GFP-shRNA 
RNAi sensor line. The screening yielded a pharmacologically active compound,
N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-N'-[3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) propyl] thiourea (IR415), which
blocked HBx-mediated RNAi suppression indicated by the GFP reporter assay. We
also found that IR415 reversed the inhibitory effect of HBx protein on activity
of the Dicer endoribonuclease. We further confirmed the results of the primary
screen in IR415-treated, HBV-infected HepG2 cells, which exhibited a marked
depletion of HBV core protein synthesis and down-regulation of pre-genomic HBV
RNA. Using a molecular interaction analysis system, we confirmed that IR415
selectively targets HBx in a concentration-dependent manner. The screening assay 
presented here allows rapid and improved detection of small-molecule inhibitors
of HBx and related viral proteins. The assay may therefore potentiate the
development of next-generation RNAi pathway-based therapeutics and promises to
accelerate our search for novel and effective drugs in antiviral research.
