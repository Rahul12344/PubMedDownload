BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum extends across
Southeast Asia where it is associated with worsening partner drug resistance and 
a decline in the efficacy of frontline artemisinin-based combination therapy.
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is an essential component of preventive and
curative treatment in the region, but its therapeutic efficacy has fallen in
Cambodia.
METHODS: A prospective clinical and parasitological evaluation of DP was
conducted at two sites in Upper Myanmar between August 2013 and December 2014,
enrolling 116 patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Patients
received DP orally for 3 days together with primaquine 0.25 mg/kg on admission.
Parasite clearance half-lives based on 6 hourly blood smears, and day 42
therapeutic responses were assessed as well as parasite K13 genotypes.
RESULTS: Median parasite clearance half-life was prolonged, and clearance
half-life was greater than 5 h in 21% of patients. Delayed parasite clearance was
significantly associated with mutations in the propeller region of the parasite
k13 gene. The k13 F446I mutation was found in 25.4% of infections and was
associated with a median clearance half-life of 4.7 h compared with 2.7 h for
infections without k13 mutations (p < 0.001). There were no failures after 42
days of follow-up, although 18% of patients had persistent parasitaemia on day 3.
CONCLUSION: The dominant k13 mutation observed in Upper Myanmar, F446I, appears
to be associated with an intermediate rate of parasite clearance compared to
other common mutations described elsewhere in the Greater Mekong Subregion.
Discerning this phenotype requires relatively detailed clearance measurements,
highlighting the importance of methodology in assessing artemisinin resistance.
