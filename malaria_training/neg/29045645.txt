Background: Malaria is endemic in French Guiana (FG), South America. Despite the 
decrease in cases in the local population, illegal gold miners are very affected 
by malaria (22.3% of them carried Plasmodium spp.). Self-medication seems to be
very common, but its modalities and associated factors have not been studied. The
aim of this study was to evaluate parasite susceptibility to drugs and to
document behaviours that could contribute to resistance selection in illegal gold
miners.
Methods: This multicentric cross-sectional study was conducted in resting sites
along the FG-Surinamese border. Participating gold miners working in FG completed
a questionnaire and provided a blood sample.
Results: From January to June 2015, 421 illegal gold miners were included. Most
were Brazilian (93.8%) and 70.5% were male. During the most recent malaria
attack, 45.5% reported having been tested for malaria and 52.4% self-medicated,
mainly with artemisinin derivatives (90%). Being in FG during the last malaria
attack was the main factor associated with self-medication (adjusted OR = 22.1). 
This suggests that access to malaria diagnosis in FG is particularly difficult
for Brazilian illegal gold miners. Treatment adherence was better for persons who
reported being tested. None of the 32 samples with Plasmodium falciparum
presented any mutation on the pfK13 gene, but one isolate showed a resistance
profile to artemisinin derivatives in vitro.
Conclusions: The risk factors for the selection of resistance are well known and 
this study showed that they are present in FG with persons who self-medicated
with poor adherence. Interventions should be implemented among this specific
population to avoid the emergence of artemisinin resistance.
