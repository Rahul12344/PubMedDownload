Blocking the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a promising strategy for 
the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), 
a key component of the sporozoite stage of the malaria parasite, was previously
reported to block NF-κB activation in hepatocytes. Therefore, in the present
study, the effect of CSP on the growth of the human lung cancer cell line, A549, 
was investigated. It was demonstrated that transfection with a recombinant
plasmid expressing CSP was able to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells in a
dose-dependent manner and induce the apoptosis of A549 cells. A NF-κB gene
reporter assay indicated that CSP and its nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif
were able to equally suppress the activation of NF-κB following stimulation with 
human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in A549 cells. Furthermore,
western blot analysis indicated that NLS did not affect the phosphorylation and
degradation of IκB, but was able to markedly inhibit the nuclear translocation of
NF-κB in TNF-α stimulated A549 cells. Therefore, the data suggest that CSP may be
investigated as a potential novel NF-κB inhibitor for the treatment of lung
cancer.
