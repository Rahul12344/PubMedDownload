Significant selection pressure has been exerted on the genomes of human
populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection, resulting in the
acquisition of mechanisms of resistance against severe malarial disease. Many
host genetic factors, including sickle cell trait, have been associated with
reduced risk of developing severe malaria, but do not account for all of the
observed phenotypic variation. Identification of novel inherited risk factors
relies upon high-resolution genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present
findings of a GWAS of severe malaria performed in a Tanzanian population (n =
914, 15.2 million SNPs). Beyond the expected association with the sickle cell HbS
variant, we identify protective associations within two interleukin receptors
(IL-23R and IL-12RBR2) and the kelch-like protein KLHL3 (all P<10-6), as well as 
near significant effects for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes.
Complementary analyses, based on detecting extended haplotype homozygosity,
identified SYNJ2BP, GCLC and MHC as potential loci under recent positive
selection. Through whole genome sequencing of an independent Tanzanian cohort
(parent-child trios n = 247), we confirm the allele frequencies of common
polymorphisms underlying associations and selection, as well as the presence of
multiple structural variants that could be in linkage with these SNPs. Imputation
of structural variants in a region encompassing the glycophorin genes on
chromosome 4, led to the characterisation of more than 50 rare variants, and
individually no strong evidence of associations with severe malaria in our
primary dataset (P>0.3). Our approach demonstrates the potential of a joint
genotyping-sequencing strategy to identify as-yet unknown susceptibility loci in 
an African population with well-characterised malaria phenotypes. The regions
encompassing these loci are potential targets for the design of much needed
interventions for preventing or treating malarial disease.
