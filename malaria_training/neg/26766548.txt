BACKGROUND: Characterizing the parasite dynamics and population structure
provides useful information to understand the dynamic of transmission and to
better target control interventions. Despite considerable efforts for its
control, vivax malaria remains a major health problem in Peru. In this study, we 
have explored the population genetics of Plasmodium vivax isolates from Iquitos, 
the main city in the Peruvian Amazon, and 25 neighbouring peri-urban as well as
rural villages along the Iquitos-Nauta Road.
METHODOLOGY/ RESULTS: From April to December 2008, 292 P. vivax isolates were
collected and successfully genotyped using 14 neutral microsatellites. Analysis
of the molecular data revealed a similar proportion of monoclonal and polyclonal 
infections in urban areas, while in rural areas monoclonal infections were
predominant (p = 0.002). Multiplicity of infection was higher in urban (MOI =
1.5-2) compared to rural areas (MOI = 1) (p = 0.003). The level of genetic
diversity was similar in all areas (He = 0.66-0.76, p = 0.32) though genetic
differentiation between areas was substantial (PHIPT = 0.17, p<0.0001). Principal
coordinate analysis showed a marked differentiation between parasites from urban 
and rural areas. Linkage disequilibrium was detected in all the areas ([Formula: 
see text] = 0.08-0.49, for all p<0.0001). Gene flow among the areas was
stablished through Bayesian analysis of migration models. Recent bottleneck
events were detected in 4 areas and a recent parasite expansion in one of the
isolated areas. In total, 87 unique haplotypes grouped in 2 or 3 genetic clusters
described a sub-structured parasite population.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows a sub-structured parasite population
with clonal propagation, with most of its components recently affected by
bottleneck events. Iquitos city is the main source of parasite spreading for all 
the peripheral study areas. The routes of transmission and gene flow and the
reduction of the parasite population described are important from the public
health perspective as well for the formulation of future control policies.
