The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum) infections in
humans is implicated in the pathogenesis of malaria. This study provides the
first estimate of the genetic diversity and genotype multiplicity of Plasmodium
falciparum infection in children with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in
Osogbo, Nigeria. One hundred and one isolates were used for analysis of parasite 
population polymorphism and genotyped by nested-PCR of merozoite surface protein 
2 (MSP2) block 3. Amplicons were obtained for all the 101 genotyped samples in
MSP2 PCR with 9 alleles varying in size between 300 and 800 base pair.
Thirty-three (31.7%) samples had FC27 allele while 27 (26.7%) had 3D7 allele and 
35 (34.7%) had mixed alleles (3D7+FC27). The Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) in
the population was 1.6. Children in the age group of > 4-8 years had the highest 
number of different genotypes in their samples (1.8). The number of MSP2 bands
per isolate was lower in the older age group (1.3) but the difference was not
statistically significant. Children with parasite density range 5001-10 000 had
the highest MOI of 2 while those with parasite density range 1000-5000 had the
lowest of 1.5. In conclusion, the present study shows that the field isolates are
highly diverse in respect of MSP2 and multiplicity of infection was neither age
nor parasite density dependent in the study population.
