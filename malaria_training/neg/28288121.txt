Current systems to study essential genes in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum are often inefficient and time intensive, and they depend on the
genetic modification of the target locus, a process hindered by the low frequency
of integration of episomal DNA into the genome. Here, we introduce a method,
termed selection-linked integration (SLI), to rapidly select for genomic
integration. SLI allowed us to functionally analyze targets at the gene and
protein levels, thus permitting mislocalization of native proteins, a strategy
known as knock sideways, floxing to induce diCre-based excision of genes and
knocking in altered gene copies. We demonstrated the power and robustness of this
approach by validating it for more than 12 targets, including eight essential
ones. We also localized and inducibly inactivated Kelch13, the protein associated
with artemisinin resistance. We expect this system to be widely applicable for P.
falciparum and other organisms with limited genetic tractability.
