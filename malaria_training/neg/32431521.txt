Purpose: Antimalarial drug resistance is one of the major challenges in global
efforts to control and eliminate malaria. In 2006, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)
replaced with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) on Bioko Island,
Equatorial Guinea, in response to increasing SP resistance, which is associated
with mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthase (Pfdhps) genes.
Patients and Methods: To evaluate the trend of molecular markers associated with 
SP resistance on Bioko Island from 2011 to 2017, 179 samples collected during
active case detection were analysed by PCR and DNA sequencing.
Results: Pfdhfr and Pfdhps gene sequences were obtained for 90.5% (162/179) and
77.1% (138/179) of the samples, respectively. For Pfdhfr, 97.5% (158/162), 95.7% 
(155/162) and 98.1% (159/162) of the samples contained N51I, C59R and S108N
mutant alleles, respectively. And Pfdhps S436A, A437G, K540E, A581G, and A613S
mutations were observed in 25.4% (35/138), 88.4% (122/138), 5.1% (7/138), 1.4%
(2/138), and 7.2% (10/138) of the samples, respectively. Two classes of
previously described Pfdhfr-Pfdhps haplotypes associated with SP resistance and
their frequencies were identified: partial (IRNI-SGKAA, 59.4%) and full
(IRNI-SGEAA, 5.5%) resistance. Although no significant difference was observed in
different time periods (p>0.05), our study confirmed a slowly increasing trend of
the frequencies of these SP-resistance markers in Bioko parasites over the 7
years investigated.
Conclusion: The findings reveal the general existence of SP-resistance markers on
Bioko Island even after the replacement of SP as a first-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria. Continuous molecular monitoring and additional control
efforts in the region are urgently needed.
