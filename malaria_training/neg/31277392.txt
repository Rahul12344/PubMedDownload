Bovine babesiosis is an acute and persistent tick-borne global disease caused
mainly by the intraerythrocytic apicomplexan parasites Babesia bovis and B.
bigemina. B. bovis infected erythrocytes sequester in blood capillaries of the
host (cytoadhesion), causing malaria-like neurological signs. Cytoadhesion and
antigenic variation in B. bovis are linked to the expression of members of the
Variant Erythrocyte Surface Antigen (VESA) gene family. Animals that survive
acute B. bovis infection and those vaccinated with attenuated strains remain
persistently infected, suggesting that B. bovis parasites use immune escape
mechanisms. However, attenuated B. bovis parasites do not cause neurological
signs in vaccinated animals, indicating that virulence or attenuation factors
play roles in modulating parasite virulence phenotypes. Artificial overexpression
of the SBP2t11 protein, a defined attenuation factor, was associated with reduced
cytoadhesion, suggesting a role for this protein as a key modulator of virulence 
in the parasite. Hereby, we propose a model that might be functional in the
modulation of B. bovis virulence and persistence that relies on the interplay
among SBP2t, VESA proteins, cytoadhesion, and the immune responses of the host.
Elucidation of mechanisms used by the parasite to establish persistent infection 
will likely contribute to the design of new methods for the control of bovine
babesiosis.
