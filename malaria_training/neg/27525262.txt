Plasmodium falciparum mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, a family of
enzymes central to signal transduction processes including inflammatory
responses, are a promising target for antimalarial drug development. Our study
shows for the first time that the P. falciparum specific MAP kinase 2 (PfMAP2) is
colocalized in the nucleus of all of the asexual erythrocytic stages of P.
falciparum and is particularly elevated in its phosphorylated form. It was also
discovered that PfMAP2 is expressed in its highest quantity during the early
trophozoite (ring form) stage and significantly reduced in the mature trophozoite
and schizont stages. Although the phosphorylated form of the kinase is always
more prevalent, its ratio relative to the nonphosphorylated form remained
constant irrespective of the parasites' developmental stage. We have also shown
that the TSH motif specifically renders PfMAP2 genetically divergent from the
other plasmodial MAP kinase activation sites using Neighbour Joining analysis.
Furthermore, TSH motif-specific designed antibody is crucial in determining the
location of the expression of the PfMAP2 protein. However, by using
immunoelectron microscopy, PPfMAP2 were detected ubiquitously in the parasitized 
erythrocytes. In summary, PfMAP2 may play a far more important role than
previously thought and is a worthy candidate for research as an antimalarial.
