OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of the K76T mutation in Pfcrt genes of
imported Plasmodium falciparum.
METHODS: The blood samples were collected from returnees infected with P.
falciparum in endemic areas of Southeast Asia and Africa from 2008 to 2012.
According to the Pfcrt gene sequence of P. falciparum, nested PCR primers were
designed. Nested PCR-RFLP was applied with falciparum DNA in the blood samples as
templates.
RESULTS: Among 92 blood samples of P. falciparum, the mutant Pfcrt alleles were
found in 50 samples (54.3%), and the wild type Pfcrt alleles were found in 42
samples (45.7%). There were 33 samples (47.1%) with mutant Pfcrt alleles and 37
samples (52.9%) with wild type, respectively, from Africa. There were 17 samples 
(77.3%) with mutant Pfcrt alleles and 5 samples (22.7%) with wild type,
respectively, from Southeast Asia. There was a significant difference between the
Africa group and the Southeast Asia group (Chi(2) = 6.12, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of Pfcrt gene mutation is different among P. falciparum
isolates from different regions. Therefore, Pfcrt K76T has an application value
in the surveillance of the imported falciparum chloroquine-resistance.
