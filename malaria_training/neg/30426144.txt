Members of the order Haemosporida are protist parasites that infect mammals,
reptiles and birds. This group includes the causal agents of malaria, Plasmodium 
parasites, the genera Leucocytozoon and Fallisia, as well as the species rich
genus Haemoproteus with its two subgenera Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus. Some
species of Haemoproteus cause severe disease in avian hosts, and these parasites 
display high levels of diversity worldwide. This diversity emphasizes the need
for accurate evolutionary information. Most molecular studies of wildlife
haemosporidians use a bar coding approach by sequencing a fragment of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. This method is efficient at differentiating
parasite lineages but insufficient for accurate phylogenetic inferences in highly
diverse taxa such as haemosporidians. Recent studies have utilized multiple
mitochondrial genes (cyt b, cox1 and cox3), sometimes combined with a few
apicoplast and nuclear genes. These studies have been highly successful with one 
notable exception: the evolutionary relationships of the genus Haemoproteus
remain unresolved. Here we describe the transcriptome of Haemoproteus columbae
and investigate its phylogenetic position recovered from a multi-gene dataset
(600 genes). This genomic approach restricts the taxon sampling to 18 species of 
apicomplexan parasites. We employed Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood
methods of phylogenetic analyses and found H. columbae and a representative from 
the subgenus Parahaemoproteus to be sister taxa. This result strengthens the
hypothesis of genus Haemoproteus being monophyletic; however, resolving this
question will require sequences of orthologs from, in particular, representatives
of Leucocytozoon species.
