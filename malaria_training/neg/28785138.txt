Inflammatory response plays an important role not only in the normal physiology
but also in pathologies such as cancers. The Morita-Baylis-Hillman adducts (MBHA)
are a novel group of synthetic molecules that have demonstrated many biological
activities against some parasitic cells such as Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania
amazonensis, and Leishmania chagasi, and antimitotic activity against sea urchin 
embryonic cells was also related. However, little is known about the mechanisms
induced by MBHA in inflammatory process and its relation with anticancer
activity. The present work investigated the cytotoxicity of three MBHA
derivatives (A2CN, A3CN, and A4CN), on human colorectal adenocarcinoma, HT-29
cells, and their anti-inflammatory activities were examined in
lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells, being these
derivatives potentially cytotoxic to HT-29 cells. Coincubation with A2CN, A3CN,
or A4CN and LPS in RAW264.7 cells inhibited NO production, as well as the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also repressed. The mRNA
expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly downregulated by such MBHA
compounds in RAW264.7 cells, but only A2CN was able to inhibit the COX-2 gene
expression. We also showed that MBHA compounds decreased almost to zero the
production of IL-1β and IL-6. These findings display that such MBHA compounds
exhibit anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
