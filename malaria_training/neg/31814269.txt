A new cyclic lipopeptide, phototemtide A (1), was isolated from Escherichia coli 
expressing the biosynthetic gene cluster pttABC from Photorhabdus temperata Meg1.
The structure of 1 was elucidated by HR-ESI-MS and NMR experiments. The absolute 
configurations of amino acids and 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid in 1 were determined by 
using the advanced Marfey's method and comparison after total synthesis of 1,
respectively. Additionally, three new minor derivatives, phototemtides B-D (2-4),
were identified by detailed HPLC-MS analysis. Phototemtide A (1) showed weak
antiprotozoal activity against Plasmodium falciparum, with an IC50 value of
9.8 μm. The biosynthesis of phototemtides A-D (1-4) was also proposed.
