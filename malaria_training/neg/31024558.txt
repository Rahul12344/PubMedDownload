An ideal malaria vaccine platform should potently induce protective immune
responses and block parasite transmission from mosquito to human, and it should
maintain these effects for an extended period. Here, we have focused on vaccine
development based on adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1), a viral vector
widely studied in the field of clinical gene therapy that is able to induce
long-term transgene expression without causing toxicity in vivo. Our results show
the potential utility of AAV1 vectors as an extremely potent booster vaccine to
induce durable immunity when combined with an adenovirus-priming vaccine in a
rodent malaria model. We generated a series of recombinant AAV1s and human
adenovirus type 5 (AdHu5) expressing either Plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) or P25 (Pfs25) protein. Heterologous two-dose
immunization with an AdHu5-prime and AAV1-boost (AdHu5-AAV1) elicited robust and 
durable PfCSP- or Pfs25-specific functional antibodies over 280 days. Regarding
protective efficacy, AdHu5-AAV1 PfCSP achieved high sterile protection (up to 80%
protection rate) against challenge with transgenic Plasmodium berghei sporozoites
expressing PfCSP. When examining transmission-blocking (TB) efficacy, we found
that immunization with AdHu5-AAV1 Pfs25 maintained TB activity in vivo against
transgenic P. berghei expressing Pfs25 for 287 days (99% reduction in oocyst
intensity, 85% reduction in oocyst prevalence). Our data indicate that AAV1-based
malaria vaccines can confer potent and durable protection as well as TB efficacy 
when administered following an AdHu5 priming vaccine, supporting the further
evaluation of this regimen in clinical trials as a next-generation malaria
vaccine platform.
