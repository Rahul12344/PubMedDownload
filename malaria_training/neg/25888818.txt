BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting histidine-rich protein 2
(PfHRP2) antigen are used to identify individuals with Plasmodium falciparum
infection even in low transmission settings seeking to achieve elimination.
However, these RDTs lack sensitivity to detect low-density infections, produce
false negatives for P. falciparum strains lacking pfhrp2 gene and do not detect
species other than P. falciparum.
METHODS: Results of a PfHRP2-based RDT and Plasmodium nested PCR were compared in
a region of declining malaria transmission in southern Zambia using samples from 
community-based, cross-sectional surveys from 2008 to 2012. Participants were
tested with a PfHRP2-based RDT and a finger prick blood sample was spotted onto
filter paper for PCR analysis and used to prepare blood smears for microscopy.
Species-specific, real-time, quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was performed on samples
that tested positive either by microscopy, RDT or nested PCR.
RESULTS: Of 3,292 total participants enrolled, 12 (0.4%) tested positive by
microscopy and 42 (1.3%) by RDT. Of 3,213 (98%) samples tested by nested PCR, 57 
(1.8%) were positive, resulting in 87 participants positive by at least one of
the three tests. Of these, 61 tested positive for P. falciparum by q-PCR with
copy numbers ≤ 2 x 10(3) copies/μL, 5 were positive for both P. falciparum and
Plasmodium malariae and 2 were positive for P. malariae alone. RDT detected 32
(53%) of P. falciparum positives, failing to detect three of the dual infections 
with P. malariae. Among 2,975 participants enrolled during a low transmission
period between 2009 and 2012, sensitivity of the PfHRP2-based RDT compared to
nested PCR was only 17%, with specificity of >99%. The pfhrp gene was detected in
80% of P. falciparum positives; however, comparison of copy number between RDT
negative and RDT positive samples suggested that RDT negatives resulted from low 
parasitaemia and not pfhrp2 gene deletion.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-density P. falciparum infections not identified by currently
used PfHRP2-based RDTs and the inability to detect non-falciparum malaria will
hinder progress to further reduce malaria in low transmission settings of Zambia.
More sensitive and specific diagnostic tests will likely be necessary to identify
parasite reservoirs and achieve malaria elimination.
