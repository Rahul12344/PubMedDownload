Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis (SAO) is a common red blood cell disorder that is
maintained as a balanced polymorphism in human populations. In individuals
heterozygous for the SAO-causing mutation there are minimal detrimental effects
and well-documented protection from severe malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax and
Plasmodium falciparum; however, the SAO-causing mutation is fully lethal in utero
when homozygous. The present-day high frequency of SAO in Island Southeast Asia
indicates the trait is maintained by strong heterozygote advantage. Our study
elucidates the evolutionary origin of SAO by characterizing DNA sequence
variation in a 9.5 kilobase region surrounding the causal mutation in the SLC4A1 
gene. We find substantial haplotype diversity among SAO chromosomes and estimate 
the age of the trait to be approximately 10,005 years (95% CI: 4930-23,200
years). This date is far older than any other human malaria-resistance trait
examined previously in Southeast Asia, and considerably pre-dates the widespread 
adoption of agriculture associated with the spread of speakers of Austronesian
languages some 4000 years ago. Using a genealogy-based method we find no evidence
of historical positive selection acting on SAO (s=0.0, 95% CI: 0.0-0.03), in
sharp contrast to the strong present-day selection coefficient (e.g., 0.09)
estimated from the frequency of this recessively lethal trait. This discrepancy
may be due to a recent increase in malaria-driven selection pressure following
the spread of agriculture, with SAO targeted as a standing variant by positive
selection in malarial populations.
