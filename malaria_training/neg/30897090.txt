OBJECTIVE: Cotrimoxazole prevents opportunistic infections including falciparum
malaria in HIV-infected individuals but there are concerns of cross-resistance to
other antifolate drugs such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). In this study, we
investigated the prevalence of antifolate-resistance mutations in Plasmodium
falciparum that are associated with SP resistance in HIV-infected individuals on 
antiretroviral treatment randomized to discontinue (STOP-CTX), or continue (CTX) 
cotrimoxazole in Western Kenya.
DESIGN: Samples were obtained from an unblinded, non-inferiority randomized
controlled trial where participants were recruited on a rolling basis for the
first six months of the study, then followed-up for 12 months with samples
collected at enrollment, quarterly, and during sick visits.
METHOD: Plasmodium DNA was extracted from blood specimens. Initial screening to
determine the presence of Plasmodium spp. was performed by quantitative reverse
transcriptase real-time PCR, followed by genotyping for the presence of
SP-resistance associated mutations by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The prevalence of mutant haplotypes associated with SP-resistant
parasites in pfdhfr (51I/59R/108N) and pfdhps (437G/540E) genes were
significantly higher (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.027, respectively) in STOP-CTX
compared to CTX arm. The prevalence of quintuple haplotype
(51I/59R/108N/437G/540E) was 51.8% in STOP-CTX vs. 6.3% (P = 0.0007) in CTX arm. 
There was a steady increase in mutant haplotypes in both genes in STOP-CTX arm
overtime through the study period, reaching statistical significance (P <
0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The frequencies of mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were higher
in STOP-CTX arm compared to CTX arm, suggesting cotrimoxazole effectively
controls and selects against SP-resistant parasites.
