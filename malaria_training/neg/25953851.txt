The MEME Suite is a powerful, integrated set of web-based tools for studying
sequence motifs in proteins, DNA and RNA. Such motifs encode many biological
functions, and their detection and characterization is important in the study of 
molecular interactions in the cell, including the regulation of gene expression. 
Since the previous description of the MEME Suite in the 2009 Nucleic Acids
Research Web Server Issue, we have added six new tools. Here we describe the
capabilities of all the tools within the suite, give advice on their best use and
provide several case studies to illustrate how to combine the results of various 
MEME Suite tools for successful motif-based analyses. The MEME Suite is freely
available for academic use at http://meme-suite.org, and source code is also
available for download and local installation.
