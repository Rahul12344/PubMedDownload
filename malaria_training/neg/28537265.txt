K13 gene mutations are a primary marker of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium
falciparum malaria that threatens the long-term clinical utility of
artemisinin-based combination therapies, the cornerstone of modern day malaria
treatment. Here we describe a multinational drug discovery programme that has
delivered a synthetic tetraoxane-based molecule, E209, which meets key
requirements of the Medicines for Malaria Venture drug candidate profiles. E209
has potent nanomolar inhibitory activity against multiple strains of P.
falciparum and P. vivax in vitro, is efficacious against P. falciparum in in vivo
rodent models, produces parasite reduction ratios equivalent to
dihydroartemisinin and has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics
compatible with a single-dose cure. In vitro studies with transgenic parasites
expressing variant forms of K13 show no cross-resistance with the C580Y mutation,
the primary variant observed in Southeast Asia. E209 is a superior next
generation endoperoxide with combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
features that overcome the liabilities of artemisinin derivatives.
