Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are valuable tools that support prudent and timely
use of antimalarial drugs, particularly if reliable microscopy is not available. 
However, the performance and reliability of these tests vary between and within
geographical regions. The present study evaluated the performance of routine
malaria RDT in Kenyan febrile patients in Busia County, Kenya. A cross sectional 
study design was employed to recruit febrile patients attending health facilities
between August and November 2016. A total of 192 febrile patients who were slide 
positive and negative were evaluated for their infection status by nested PCR and
RDTs (PfHRP2/pLDH). In addition, P. falciparum diversity of the histidine-rich
proteins 2 and 3, that influences the RDT test results were determined. All
individuals were P. falciparum positive. Among the investigated 192 febrile
patients, 76 (40%) were positive by microscopy, 101 (53%) by RDTs and 80 (42%)
were PCR positive. The performance of the CareStart™ HRP2/pLDH (pf) RDTs was
better than microscopy (Sensitivity 94%; Specificity 75%) and Nucleic acid
testing (sensitivity 95%, specificity 77%) with high negative predictive values, 
indicating the suitability of the RDT in routine practice. Specific pfhrp2/pfhrp3
deletions shown to associate with RDT false negativity was not observed. However,
high genetic diversity among pfhrp2 gene was observed. Eleven new PfHRP2 and nine
PfHRP3 repeats were observed. False positivity by microscopy and under reporting 
of infections may thus be a barrier in malaria control and elimination programs. 
The HRP2/pLDH(Pf) based RDT yet demonstrate to be an effective tool for malaria
surveillance program.
