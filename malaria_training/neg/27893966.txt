Plastid-made biopharmaceuticals treat major metabolic or genetic disorders,
including Alzheimer's, diabetes, hypertension, hemophilia, and retinopathy.
Booster vaccines made in chloroplasts prevent global infectious diseases, such as
tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and polio, and biological threats, such as
anthrax and plague. Recent advances in this field include commercial-scale
production of human therapeutic proteins in FDA-approved cGMP facilities,
development of tags to deliver protein drugs to targeted human cells or tissues, 
methods to deliver precise doses, and long-term stability of protein drugs at
ambient temperature, maintaining their efficacy. Codon optimization utilizing
valuable information from sequenced chloroplast genomes enhanced expression of
eukaryotic human or viral genes in chloroplasts and offered unique insights into 
translation in chloroplasts. Support from major biopharmaceutical companies,
development of hydroponic production systems, and evaluation by regulatory
agencies, including the CDC, FDA, and USDA, augur well for advancing this novel
concept to the clinic and revolutionizing affordable healthcare.
