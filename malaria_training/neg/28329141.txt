Background: In Myanmar, civil unrest and the establishment of internally
displaced person (IDP) settlements along the Myanmar-China border have impacted
malaria transmission.
Methods: Microsatellite markers were used to examine source-sink dynamics for
Plasmodium vivax between IDP settlements and surrounding villages in the border
region. Genotypic structure and diversity were compared across the 3 years
following the establishment of IDP settlements, to infer demographic history. We 
investigated whether human migration and landscape heterogeneity contributed to
P. vivax transmission.
Results: P. vivax from IDP settlements and local communities consistently
exhibited high genetic diversity within populations but low polyclonality within 
individuals. No apparent genetic structure was observed among populations and
years. P. vivax genotypes in China were similar to those in Myanmar, and parasite
introduction was unidirectional. Landscape factors, including distance,
elevation, and land cover, do not appear to impede parasite gene flow.
Conclusions: The admixture of P. vivax genotypes suggested that parasite gene
flow via human movement contributes to the spread of malaria both locally in
Myanmar and across the international border. Our genetic findings highlight the
presence of large P. vivax gene reservoirs that can sustain transmission. Thus,
it is important to reinforce and improve existing control efforts along border
areas.
