Spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and Coxiella burnetii are intracellular
bacteria that cause potentially life-threatening tick-borne rickettsioses and Q
fever respectively. Sao Tome and Principe (STP), small islands located in the
Gulf of Guinea, recently experienced a dramatic reduction in the incidence of
malaria owing to international collaborative efforts. However, unexplained
febrile illnesses persist. A One Health approach was adopted to investigate
exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii in humans and examine the diversity of these
bacteria in ticks parasitizing domestic ruminants. A cross-sectional human
serological study was conducted in Agua Grande district in Sao Tome Island from
January to March 2016, and ticks were collected from farmed domestic ruminants in
2012 and 2016. In total, 240 individuals varying in age were randomly screened
for exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Twenty
of 240 individuals (8.3%) were seropositive for SFGR (4 for Rickettsia africae
and 16 for R. conorii) and 16 (6.7%) were seropositive for C. burnetii. Amblyomma
astrion were collected exclusively in 2012, as were A. variegatum in 2016 and
Rickettsia spp. were detected in 22/42 (52.4%) and 49/60 (81.7%) respectively.
Sequence analysis of multiple gene targets from Rickettsia spp. detected in ticks
suggests the presence of a single divergent R. africae strain (Sao Tome). While
no ticks were found positive for C. burnetii, Coxiella-like endosymbionts were
detected in nearly all ticks. This is the first study in STP to provide
serological evidence in humans of SFGR and C. burnetii and additional molecular
evidence in ticks for SFGR, which may be responsible for some of the unexplained 
febrile illnesses that persist despite the control of malaria. Future
epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the occurrence and risk factors
associated with SFG rickettsioses and Q fever in both humans and animals.
