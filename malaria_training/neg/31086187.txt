Plasmodium sexual differentiation is required for malaria transmission, yet much 
remains unknown about its regulation. Here, we quantify early
gametocyte-committed ring (gc-ring) stage, P. falciparum parasites in 260
uncomplicated malaria patient blood samples 10 days before maturation to
transmissible stage V gametocytes using a gametocyte conversion assay (GCA).
Seventy six percent of the samples have gc-rings, but the ratio of gametocyte to 
asexual-committed rings (GCR) varies widely (0-78%). GCR correlates positively
with parasitemia and is negatively influenced by fever, not hematocrit, age or
leukocyte counts. Higher expression levels of GDV1-dependent genes, ap2-g, msrp1 
and gexp5, as well as a gdv1 allele encoding H217 are associated with high GCR,
while high plasma lysophosphatidylcholine levels are associated with low GCR in
the second study year. The results provide a view of sexual differentiation in
the field and suggest key regulatory roles for clinical factors and gdv1 in
gametocytogenesis in vivo.
