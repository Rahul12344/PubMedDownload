The unique occurrence of G-quadruplexes in the AT-rich genome of human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum provides hints about their critical roles in
parasite survival, pathogenesis, and host immune evasion. An intriguing question 
is whether these noncanonical structures can serve as molecular targets for small
molecule-based interventions against malaria. In this study, we have investigated
the pharmacological targeting of G-quadruplexes for parasite inhibition. We
observed that bisquinolinium derivatives of 1,8-naphthyridine and pyridine
affected the stability and molecular recognition properties of G-quadruplexes in 
telomeric and subtelomeric regions in P. falciparum. Parasite inhibition and
cytotoxicity assays revealed that these ligands effectively inhibit parasite
growth with minimal toxic effects in human cells. G-quadruplex interacting
ligands caused degeneration and shortening of parasite telomeres. Ligand-induced 
perturbations in telomere homeostasis also affected transcriptional state of the 
subtelomeric region harboring antigenic variation genes. Taken together, our
results suggest that quadruplex-ligand interaction disturbs
telomeric/subtelomeric chromatin organization and induces DNA damage that
consequently leads to parasite death. Our findings also draw attention to the
striking differences in telomere dynamics in the protozoan parasite and human
host that can be exploited for selective targeting of the telomeric quadruplex of
the parasite as a potential antimalarial strategy.
