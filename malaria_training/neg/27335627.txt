Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1/CD31), a receptor
recognized by P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBCs), on the vascular
endothelium has been implicated in mediating cytoadherence in patients with P.
falciparum malaria. To examine associations of PECAM1 polymorphisms with cerebral
malaria, 11 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PECAM1 were analysed
for 312 Thai patients with P. falciparum malaria (109 with cerebral malaria and
203 with mild malaria). The rs1122800-C allele was significantly associated with 
protection from cerebral malaria (P = 0.017), and the rs9912957-A significantly
increased the risk for cerebral malaria (P = 0.0065) in malaria patients.
Fine-scale mapping using genotyped and imputed SNPs and linkage disequilibrium
(LD) analysis revealed that rs1122800 and rs9912957 were located in two distinct 
LD blocks and were independently associated with cerebral malaria. The
rs1122800-C allele was significantly associated with lower expression level of
PECAM1 in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (P = 0.045). The present
results suggest that PECAM1-mediated cytoadherence of iRBCs to brain endothelium 
plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.
