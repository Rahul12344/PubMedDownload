DNA insulators organize independent gene regulatory domains and can regulate
interactions amongst promoter and enhancer elements. They have the potential to
be important in genome enhancing and editing technologies because they can
mitigate chromosomal position effects on transgenes. The orthologous genes of the
Anopheles stephensi putative gypsy-like insulator protein complex were identified
and expression characteristics studied. These genes encode polypeptides with all 
the expected protein domains (Cysteine 2 Histidine 2 (C2H2) zinc fingers and/or a
bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger). The mosquito gypsy transcripts are
expressed constitutively and are upregulated in ovaries of blood-fed females. We 
have uncovered significant experimental evidence that the gypsy insulator protein
complex is widespread in vector mosquitoes.
