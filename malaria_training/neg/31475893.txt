BACKGROUND: Presently, malaria is one of the most prevalent and deadly infectious
disease across Africa, Asia, and America that has now started to spread in
Europe. Despite large research being carried out in the field, still, there is a 
lack of efficient anti-malarial therapeutics. In this paper, we highlight the
increasing efforts that are urgently needed towards the development and discovery
of potential antimalarial drugs, which must be safe and affordable. The new drugs
thus mentioned are also able to counter the spread of malaria parasites that have
been resistant to the existing agents.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the review is to highlight the recent
development in the use of system biologybased approaches towards the design and
discovery of novel anti-malarial inhibitors.
METHOD: A huge literature survey was performed to gain advance knowledge about
the global persistence of malaria, its available treatment and shortcomings of
the available inhibitors. Literature search and depth analysis were also done to 
gain insight into the use of system biology in drug discovery and how this
approach could be utilized towards the development of the novel anti-malarial
drug.
RESULTS: The system-based analysis has made easy to understand large scale
sequencing data, find candidate genes expression during malaria disease
progression further design of drug molecules those are complementary of the
target proteins in term of shape and configuration.
CONCLUSION: The review article focused on the recent computational advances in
new generation sequencing, molecular modeling, and docking related to malaria
disease and utilization of the modern system and network biology approach to
antimalarial potential drug discovery and development.
