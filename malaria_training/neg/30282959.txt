Bioassays and molecular diagnostics are routinely used for the monitoring of
malaria vector populations to support insecticide resistance management (IRM),
guiding operational decisions on which insecticides ought to be used for
effective vector control. Previously developed TaqMan assays were optimised to
distinguish the wild-type L1014 from the knockdown resistance (kdr) point
mutations 1014F and 1014S (triplex reaction), and the N1575 wild-type from the
point mutation 1575Y (duplex reaction). Subsequently, artificial pools of
Anopheles gambiae (An. gambiae) specimens with known genotypes of L1014F, L1014S,
and N1575Y were created, nucleic acids were extracted, and kdr mutations were
detected. These data were then used to define a linear regression model that
predicts the allelic frequency within a pool of mosquitoes as a function of the
measured ΔCt values (Ct mutant - Ct wild type probe). Polynomial regression
models showed r2 values of >0.99 (p < 0.05). The method was validated with
populations of variable allelic frequencies, and found to be precise
(1.66⁻2.99%), accurate (3.3⁻5.9%), and able to detect a single heterozygous
mosquito mixed with 9 wild type individuals in a pool of 10. Its pilot
application in field-caught samples showed minimal differences from individual
genotyping (0.36⁻4.0%). It allowed the first detection of the super-kdr mutation 
N1575Y in An. gambiae from Mali. Using pools instead of individuals allows for
more efficient resistance allele screening, facilitating IRM.
