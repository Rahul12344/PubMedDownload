BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous malaria parasite species to
humans remains an important public health concern in Okelele, a rural community
in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. There is however little information about the
genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in Nigeria.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the population genomic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum
in malaria patients attending Okelele Community Healthcare Centre, Okelele,
Ilorin, Kwara State.
METHODS: In this study, 50 Plasmodium falciparum strains Merozoite Surface
Protein 1, Merozoite Surface Protein 2 and Glutamate Rich Protein were analysed
from Okelele Health Centre, Okelele, Ilorin, Nigeria. Genetic diversity of P.
falciparum isolates were analysed from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of
the MSP-1 (K1, MAD 20 and RO33), MSP-2 (FC27 and 3D7) and Glutamate Rich Protein 
allelic families respectively.
RESULTS: Polyclonal infections were more in majority of the patients for MSP-1
allelic families while monoclonal infections were more for MSP-2 allelic
families. Multiplicity of infection for MSP-1, MSP-2 and GLURP were 1.7, 1.8 and 
2.05 respectively.
CONCLUSION: There is high genetic diversity in MSP - 2 and GLURP allelic families
of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Okelele Health Centre, Ilorin, Nigeria.
