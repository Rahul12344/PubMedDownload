Theileria annulata is the pathogen of bovine tropical theileriosis. It is
extremely harmful to the cattle industry, with huge economic losses. The
toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways are
crucial for resistance to infection of the protozoa, such as Plasmodium
falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the role of these 
immune-related pathways is unclear during T. annulata infection. In the present
study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum were separated from blood
samples of calves infected with homogenized tick supernatants carrying T.
annulata sporozoites at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h and
168 h postinoculation. The Custom RT2 Profiler PCR Array was used to explore the 
mRNA levels of 42 TLR and NLR signaling pathway relevant genes. The TLR1, TLR6,
TLR10, NLRP1, and MyD88 genes and their downstream signaling molecules
significantly differed after the T. annulata infection in comparison with that of
preinfection from 72 h to 168 h postinoculation. The serum concentrations of
IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα were significantly increased at 96 h and 168 h
postinfection. These findings provided novel information to help determine the
mechanisms of TLR and NLR signaling pathway involvement in protection against T. 
annulata infection.
