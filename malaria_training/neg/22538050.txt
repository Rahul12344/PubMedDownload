Mosquitoes are the major arthropod vectors of human diseases such as malaria and 
viral encephalitis. However, each mosquito species does not transmit every
pathogen, owing to reasons that include specific evolutionary histories, mosquito
immune system structure, and ecology. Even a competent vector species for a
pathogen displays a wide range of variation between individuals for pathogen
susceptibility, and therefore efficiency of disease transmission. Understanding
the molecular and genetic mechanisms that determine heterogeneities in
transmission efficiency within a vector species could help elaborate new vector
control strategies. This review discusses mechanisms of host-defense in Anopheles
gambiae, and sources of genetic and ecological variation in the operation of
these protective factors. Comparison is made between functional studies using
Plasmodium or fungus, and we call attention to the limitations of generalizing
gene phenotypes from experiments done in a single genetically simple colony.
