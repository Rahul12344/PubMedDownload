Plasmodium falciparum proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion are main targets 
of acquired immunity and important vaccine candidates. We hypothesized that
anti-parasite immunity acquired upon exposure would limit invasion-related gene
(IRG) expression and affect the clinical impact of the infection. 11 IRG
transcript levels were measured in P. falciparum isolates by RT-PCR, and IgG/IgM 
against invasion ligands by Luminex®, in 50 Mozambican adults, 25 children with
severe malaria (SM) and 25 with uncomplicated malaria (UM). IRG expression
differences among groups and associations between IRG expression and
clinical/immunologic parameters were assessed. IRG expression diversity was
higher in parasites infecting children than adults (p = 0.022). eba140 and ptramp
expression decreased with age (p = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively) whereas p41
expression increased (p = 0.022). pfrh5 reduction in expression was abrupt early 
in life. Parasite density decreased with increasing pfrh5 expression (p < 0.001) 
and, only in children, parasite density increased with p41 expression
(p = 0.007), and decreased with eba175 (p = 0.013). Antibody responses and IRG
expression were not associated. In conclusion, IRG expression is associated with 
age and parasite density, but not with specific antibody responses in the acute
phase of infection. Our results confirm the importance of multi-antigen vaccines 
development to avoid parasite immune escape when tested in malaria-exposed
individuals.
