BACKGROUND: When selecting blood donors in transfusion centres, one important
problem is to identify, during screening, individuals with infectious diseases
that can be transmitted by blood, such as malaria, especially when the parasite
densities are very low. This problem is particularly severe in endemic areas,
such as the Brazilian Amazon. In the present study, molecular diagnostic
(real-time PCR) of Plasmodium vivax was used to identify blood donors infected
with malaria parasites.
METHODS: Samples from 595 blood donors were collected in seven haemotherapy
centres in northern Brazil located in areas at risk for malaria transmission, and
the analyses were performed by real-time PCR with TaqMan probes on 7500 Real-Time
PCR Systems, to genotype the mitochondrial DNA region specific to P. vivax. The
experiment was designed for hybridization of the cytochrome c oxidase genes of
the mitochondrial genome (GenBank GI63022502). The serological data were obtained
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA (Anti-HIV, Anti-HTLV I-II;
Anti-HVC, HBsAg, Anti-HBc, Chagas disease) and VDRL (Syphilis) from the Blood
Bank System of the Haematology and Haemotherapy Centre of Pará.
RESULTS: The assay identified eight individuals in the sample (1.34%) infected
with P. vivax at the time of blood donation. This percentage was higher than the 
altered serological results (reactive or inconclusive) of the prevalence of
anti-HIV (0.67%), anti-hepatitis C virus (0.34%), anti-hepatitis B surface
antigen (0.67%), anti-human T-lymphotropic virus I/II (1.18%), anti-Chagas
disease (0.17%) and syphilis (VDRL) (0.50%), but not higher than anti-hepatitis B
core antigen antibodies (4.37%). This result indicates the need to use more
sensitive methods of diagnosing malaria in blood banks.
CONCLUSION: The real-time PCR with TaqMan probes enabled the identification of P.
vivax in a high proportion of clinically healthy donors, highlighting the
potential risk for transfusion-transmitted malaria. Additionally, this molecular 
diagnostic tool can be adopted as a new laboratory screening method in
haemotherapy centres, especially in malaria-endemic areas.
