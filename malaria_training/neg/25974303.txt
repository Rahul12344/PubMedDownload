Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan pathogen in the phylum Apicomplexa that resides 
within an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is selectively
permeable to small molecules through unidentified mechanisms. We have identified 
GRA17 as a Toxoplasma-secreted protein that localizes to the parasitophorous
vacuole membrane (PVM) and mediates passive transport of small molecules across
the PVM. GRA17 is related to the putative Plasmodium translocon protein EXP2 and 
conserved across PV-residing Apicomplexa. The PVs of GRA17-deficient parasites
have aberrant morphology, reduced permeability to small molecules, and structural
instability. GRA17-deficient parasites proliferate slowly and are avirulent in
mice. These GRA17-deficient phenotypes are rescued by complementation with
Plasmodium EXP2. GRA17 functions synergistically with a related protein, GRA23.
Exogenous expression of GRA17 or GRA23 alters the membrane conductance properties
of Xenopus oocytes in a manner consistent with a large non-selective pore. Thus, 
GRA17 and GRA23 provide a molecular basis for PVM permeability and nutrient
access.
