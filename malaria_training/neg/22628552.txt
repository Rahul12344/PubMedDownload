It is generally accepted that the mitochondria play central roles in energy
production of most eukaryotes. In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium
spp., the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood
stages. However, Plasmodium spp. possesses all genes necessary for the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and most of the genes for electron transport chain
(ETC) enzymes. Therefore, it remains elusive whether oxidative phosphorylation is
essential for the parasite survival. To elucidate the role of TCA metabolism and 
ETC in malaria parasites, we deleted the gene for flavoprotein (Fp) subunit,
Pbsdha, one of four components of complex II, a catalytic subunit for succinate
dehydrogenase activity. The Pbsdha(-) parasite grew normally at blood stages in
mouse. In contrast, ookinete formation of Pbsdha(-) parasites in the mosquito
stage was severely impaired. Finally, Pbsdha(-) ookinetes failed in oocyst
formation, leading to complete malaria transmission blockade. These results
suggest that malaria parasite may switch the energy metabolism from glycolysis to
oxidative phosphorylation to adapt to the insect vector where glucose is not
readily available for ATP production.
