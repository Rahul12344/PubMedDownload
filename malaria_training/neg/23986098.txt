We recently characterized 24-hr daily rhythmic patterns of gene expression in
Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. These include numerous odorant binding proteins
(OBPs), soluble odorant carrying proteins enriched in olfactory organs. Here we
demonstrate that multiple rhythmically expressed genes including OBPs and takeout
proteins, involved in regulating blood feeding behavior, have corresponding
rhythmic protein levels as measured by quantitative proteomics. This includes
AgamOBP1, previously shown as important to An. gambiae odorant sensing. Further, 
electrophysiological investigations demonstrate time-of-day specific differences 
in olfactory sensitivity of antennae to major host-derived odorants. The
pre-dusk/dusk peaks in OBPs and takeout gene expression correspond with peak
protein abundance at night, and in turn coincide with the time of increased
olfactory sensitivity to odorants requiring OBPs and times of increased
blood-feeding behavior. This suggests an important role for OBPs in modulating
temporal changes in odorant sensitivity, enabling the olfactory system to
coordinate with the circadian niche of An. gambiae.
