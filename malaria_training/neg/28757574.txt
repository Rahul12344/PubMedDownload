Perforin is critical for controlling viral infection and tumor surveillance.
Clinically, mutations in perforin are viewed as unfavorable, as lack of this
pore-forming protein results in lethal, childhood disease, familial
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (FHL 2). However, many mutations in the
coding region of PRF1 are not yet associated with disease. Animal models of
viral-associated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and experimental cerebral
malaria (ECM) have identified perforin as critical for inducing pathologic
central nervous system CNS vascular permeability. This review focuses on the role
of perforin in both protecting and promoting human disease. It concludes with a
novel hypothesis that diversity observed in the PRF1 gene may be an example of
selective advantage that protects an individual from perforin-mediated pathology,
such as BBB disruption.
