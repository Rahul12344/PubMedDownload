During infection, increasing pathogen load stimulates both protective and harmful
aspects of the host response. The dynamics of this interaction are hard to
quantify in humans, but doing so could improve understanding of the mechanisms of
disease and protection. We sought to model the contributions of the parasite
multiplication rate and host response to observed parasite load in individual
subjects infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, using only data obtained at
the time of clinical presentation, and then to identify their mechanistic
correlates. We predicted higher parasite multiplication rates and lower host
responsiveness in cases of severe malaria, with severe anaemia being more
insidious than cerebral malaria. We predicted that parasite-growth inhibition was
associated with platelet consumption, lower expression of CXCL10 and type 1
interferon-associated genes, but increased cathepsin G and matrix
metallopeptidase 9 expression. We found that cathepsin G and matrix
metallopeptidase 9 directly inhibit parasite invasion into erythrocytes. The
parasite multiplication rate was associated with host iron availability and
higher complement factor H levels, lower expression of gametocyte-associated
genes but higher expression of translation-associated genes in the parasite. Our 
findings demonstrate the potential of using explicit modelling of pathogen load
dynamics to deepen understanding of host-pathogen interactions and identify
mechanistic correlates of protection.
