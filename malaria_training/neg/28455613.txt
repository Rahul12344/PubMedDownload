Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone that plays an important
role in cellular proteostasis. Hsp70s are also implicated in the survival and
pathogenicity of malaria parasites. The main agent of malaria, Plasmodium
falciparum, expresses six Hsp70s. Of these, two (PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z)
localize to the parasite cytosol. Previously conducted gene knockout studies
suggested that PfHsp70-z is essential, and it has been demonstrated that
small-molecule inhibitors targeting PfHsp70-1 cause parasite death. For this
reason, both PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z are potential antimalarial targets. Two
cyclic lipopeptides, colistin and polymyxin B (PMB), have been shown to bind
another heat shock protein, Hsp90, inhibiting its chaperone function. In the
current study, we investigated the effect of PMB on the structure-function
features of PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we
observed that PMB directly interacts with both PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z. In
addition, using circular dichroism spectrometric analysis combined with
tryptophan fluorescence measurements, we observed that PMB modulated the
secondary and tertiary structures of Hsp70. Furthermore, PMB inhibited the basal 
ATPase activity and chaperone function of the two Hsp70s. Our findings suggest
that PMB associates with Hsp70 to inhibit its function. In light of the central
role of Hsp70 in cellular proteostasis and its essential role in the development 
of malaria parasites in particular, our findings expand the library of
small-molecule inhibitors that target this medically important class of molecular
chaperones.
