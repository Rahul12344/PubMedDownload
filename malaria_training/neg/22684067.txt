Adenylate kinases (AKs) are phosphotransferase enzymes that catalyze the
interconversion of adenine nucleotides, thereby playing an important role in
energy metabolism. In Plasmodium falciparum, three AK isoforms, namely PfAK1,
PfAK2 and GTP:AMP phosphotransferase (PfGAK), have been identified. While PfAK1
and PfAK2 catalyse the conversion of ATP and AMP to two molecules of ADP, PfGAK
exhibits a substrate preference for GTP and AMP and does not accept ATP as a
substrate. PfGAK was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using 
two-step chromatography. Brown hexagonal crystals of PfGAK were obtained and a
preliminary diffraction analysis was performed. X-ray diffraction data for a
single PfGAK crystal were processed to 2.9 Å resolution in space group P3(1)21 or
P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 123.49, c = 180.82 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 
120°.
