Malaria is a major public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Despite progress achieved over the past decade in the fight against malaria,
further efforts have to be done such as in the surveillance and the containment
of Plasmodium falciparum resistant strains. We investigated resistance to
artemisinin-based combination therapies currently in use in Democratic Republic
of Congo by surveying molecular polymorphisms in three genes: pfcrt, pfmdr1 and
pfk13 to explore possible emergence of amodiaquine, lumefantrine or artemisinin
resistance in Democratic Republic of Congo. This study essentially revealed that 
resistance to chloroquine is still decreasing while polymorphism related to
amodiaquine resistance seems to be not present in Democratic Republic of Congo,
that three samples, located in the east of the country, harbor Pfmdr1
amplification and that none of the mutations found in South-East Asia correlated 
with artemisinine resistance have been found in Democratic Republic of Congo. But
new mutations have been identified, especially the M476K, occurred in the same
position that the M476I previously identified in the F32-ART strain, strongly
resistant to artemisinine. Antimalarial first-line treatments currently in use in
Democratic Republic of Congo are not associated with emergence of molecular
markers of resistance.
