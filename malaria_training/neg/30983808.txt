PURPOSE: Scrub typhus an acute febrile illness has diverse clinical
manifestations, which overlap with other febrile illnesses. Due to this reason,
it is misdiagnosed, leading to inappropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in
fatality. Thus, accurate diagnosis of scrub typhus is important for appropriate
treatment. This study evaluated the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
assay as a diagnostic test for scrub typhus among patients with fever.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 cases of acute febrile illness clinically
resembling scrub typhus, with or without an eschar, or cases of pyrexia of
unknown origin were included in the study. Blood samples collected from these
cases were subjected to detection of IgM antibodies to Orientia tsutsugamushi by 
ELISA, conventional groEL polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the LAMP assay.
RESULTS: Twelve cases had fever for less than a week, and two had fever for more 
than 3 weeks. IgM antibodies to O. tsutsugamushi were detected in 37 out of 50
samples (74%). LAMP assay was positive in 33 samples (66%). groEL gene-based PCR 
detected 35 (70%) samples as positive. Two samples negative by LAMP assay were
positive by this PCR. Twenty samples collected from patients with dengue,
typhoid, and malaria tested by the LAMP assay were negative, indicating its good 
specificity. LAMP assay and the conventional groEL-based PCR could detect 72.7%
and 74.3% of the samples, respectively before the 10th day after onset of fever, 
whereas IgM ELISA could detect only 40.5% of the 37 samples.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that LAMP assay could be a useful diagnostic test
for detecting scrub typhus in the acute phase of the illness and a cheaper
alternative to other molecular methods in resource poor settings.
