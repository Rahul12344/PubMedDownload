For effective control of pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes, precise surveillance
data of mosquito distribution are essential. Recently, an increase of insecticide
resistance due to the kdr mutation in Anopheles gambiae, a mosquito that
transmits the malaria parasite, has been reported. With the aim of developing a
simple and effective method for surveying resistant mosquitoes, LAMP was applied 
to the allele-specific detection of the kdr gene in An. gambiae. Allele-specific 
LAMP (AS-LAMP) method successfully distinguished the kdr homozygote from the
heterozygote and the wild type. The robustness of AS-LAMP suggests its usefulness
for routine identification of insects, not only mosquitoes but also other vectors
and agricultural pests. Here we describe the method of AS-LAMP to detect mutation
in Anopheles mosquitoes.
