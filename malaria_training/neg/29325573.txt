BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity of the three important antigenic proteins, namely
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), apical membrane antigen 1
(AMA1), and 6-cysteine protein (P48/45), all of which are found in various
developmental stages of Plasmodium parasites is crucial for targeted vaccine
development. While studies related to the genetic diversity of these proteins are
available for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, barely enough
information exists regarding Plasmodium malariae. The present study aims to
demonstrate the genetic variations existing among these three genes in P.
malariae by analysing their diversity at nucleotide and protein levels.
METHODS: Three surface protein genes were isolated from 45 samples collected in
Thailand (N = 33), Myanmar (N = 8), and Lao PDR (N = 4), using conventional
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Then, the PCR products were sequenced and 
analysed using BioEdit, MEGA6, and DnaSP programs.
RESULTS: The average pairwise nucleotide diversities (π) of P. malariae trap,
ama1, and p48/45 were 0.00169, 0.00413, and 0.00029, respectively. The haplotype 
diversities (Hd) of P. malariae trap, ama1, and p48/45 were 0.919, 0.946, and
0.130, respectively. Most of the nucleotide substitutions were non-synonymous,
which indicated that the genetic variations of these genes were maintained by
positive diversifying selection, thus, suggesting their role as a potential
target of protective immune response. Amino acid substitutions of P. malariae
TRAP, AMA1, and P48/45 could be categorized to 17, 20, and 2 unique amino-acid
variants, respectively. For further vaccine development, carboxyl terminal of
P48/45 would be a good candidate according to conserved amino acid at low genetic
diversity (π = 0.2-0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: High mutational diversity was observed in P. malariae trap and ama1 
as compared to p48/45 in P. malariae samples isolated from Thailand, Myanmar, and
Lao PDR. Taken together, these results suggest that P48/45 might be a good
vaccine candidate against P. malariae infection because of its sufficiently low
genetic diversity and highly conserved amino acids especially on the carboxyl
end.
