Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease; yet half of the world's
population lives at risk of infection, and an estimated 660,000 people die of
malaria-related causes every year. Rising drug resistance threatens to make
malaria untreatable, necessitating both the discovery of new antimalarial agents 
and the development of strategies to identify and suppress the emergence and
spread of drug resistance. We focused on in-development dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors. Characterizing resistance pathways for
antimalarial agents not yet in clinical use will increase our understanding of
the potential for resistance. We identified resistance mechanisms of Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) DHODH inhibitors via in vitro resistance selections. We found 11 
point mutations in the PfDHODH target. Target gene amplification and unknown
mechanisms also contributed to resistance, albeit to a lesser extent. These
mutant parasites were often hypersensitive to other PfDHODH inhibitors, which
immediately suggested a novel combination therapy approach to preventing
resistance. Indeed, a combination of wild-type and mutant-type selective
inhibitors led to resistance far less often than either drug alone. The effects
of point mutations in PfDHODH were corroborated with purified recombinant
wild-type and mutant-type PfDHODH proteins, which showed the same trends in drug 
response as the cognate cell lines. Comparative growth assays demonstrated that
two mutant parasites grew less robustly than their wild-type parent, and the
purified protein of those mutants showed a decrease in catalytic efficiency,
thereby suggesting a reason for the diminished growth rate. Co-crystallography of
PfDHODH with three inhibitors suggested that hydrophobic interactions are
important for drug binding and selectivity.
