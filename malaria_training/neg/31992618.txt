New antimalarial drugs are needed. The benzoxaborole AN13762 showed excellent
activity against cultured Plasmodium falciparum, against fresh Ugandan P.
falciparum isolates, and in murine malaria models. To gain mechanistic insights, 
we selected in vitro for P. falciparum isolates resistant to AN13762. In all of
11 independent selections with 100 to 200 nM AN13762, the 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) increased from 18-118 nM to 180-890 nM, and whole-genome
sequencing of resistant parasites demonstrated mutations in prodrug activation
and resistance esterase (PfPARE). The introduction of PfPARE mutations led to a
similar level of resistance, and recombinant PfPARE hydrolyzed AN13762 to the
benzoxaborole AN10248, which has activity similar to that of AN13762 but for
which selection of resistance was not readily achieved. Parasites further
selected with micromolar concentrations of AN13762 developed higher-level
resistance (IC50, 1.9 to 5.0 μM), and sequencing revealed additional mutations in
any of 5 genes, 4 of which were associated with ubiquitination/sumoylation enzyme
cascades; the introduction of one of these mutations, in SUMO-activating enzyme
subunit 2, led to a similar level of resistance. The other gene mutated in highly
resistant parasites encodes the P. falciparum cleavage and specificity factor
homolog PfCPSF3, previously identified as the antimalarial target of another
benzoxaborole. Parasites selected for resistance to AN13762 were cross-resistant 
with a close analog, AN13956, but not with standard antimalarials, AN10248, or
other benzoxaboroles known to have different P. falciparum targets. Thus, AN13762
appears to have a novel mechanism of antimalarial action and multiple mechanisms 
of resistance, including loss of function of PfPARE preventing activation to
AN10248, followed by alterations in ubiquitination/sumoylation pathways or
PfCPSF3.IMPORTANCE Benzoxaboroles are under study as potential new drugs to treat
malaria. One benzoxaborole, AN13762, has potent activity and promising features, 
but its mechanisms of action and resistance are unknown. To gain insights into
these mechanisms, we cultured malaria parasites with nonlethal concentrations of 
AN13762 and generated parasites with varied levels of resistance. Parasites with 
low-level resistance had mutations in PfPARE, which processes AN13762 into an
active metabolite; PfPARE mutations prevented this processing. Parasites with
high-level resistance had mutations in any of a number of enzymes, mostly those
involved in stress responses. Parasites selected for AN13762 resistance were not 
resistant to other antimalarials, suggesting novel mechanisms of action and
resistance for AN13762, a valuable feature for a new class of antimalarial drugs.
