Atomic force microscopy image analysis and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction
experiments were used to investigate the structural organization of cationic
nanoemulsion/oligonucleotide complexes. Oligonucleotides targeting topoisomerase 
II gene were adsorbed on cationic nanoemulsions obtained by means of spontaneous 
emulsification procedure. Topographical analysis by atomic force microscopy
allowed the observation of the nanoemulsion/oligonucleotide complexes through
three-dimensional high-resolution images. Flattening of the oil droplets was
observed, which was reduced in the complexes obtained at high amount of adsorbed 
oligonucleotides. In such conditions, complexes exhibit droplet size in the 600nm
range. The oligonucleotides molecules were detected on the surface of the
droplets, preventing their fusion during aggregation. A lamellar structure
organization was identified by energy dispersive X-ray diffraction experiments.
The presence of the nucleic acid molecules led to a disorganization of the lipid 
arrangement and an expansion in the lattice spacing, which was proportional to
the amount of oligonucleotides added.
