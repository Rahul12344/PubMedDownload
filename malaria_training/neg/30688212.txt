Case fatality rates in severe falciparum malaria depend on the pattern and degree
of vital organ dysfunction. Recent large-scale case-control analyses of pooled
severe malaria data reported that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
(G6PDd) was protective against cerebral malaria but increased the risk of severe 
malarial anaemia. A novel formulation of the balancing selection hypothesis was
proposed as an explanation for these findings, whereby the selective advantage is
driven by the competing risks of death from cerebral malaria and death from
severe malarial anaemia. We re-analysed these claims using causal diagrams and
showed that they are subject to collider bias. A simulation based sensitivity
analysis, varying the strength of the known effect of G6PDd on anaemia, showed
that this bias is sufficient to explain all of the observed association. Future
genetic epidemiology studies in severe malaria would benefit from the use of
causal reasoning.
