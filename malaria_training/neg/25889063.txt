BACKGROUND: Deficiency of the enzyme G6PD (G6PDd) is caused by mutations in the
gene G6PD, which plays an important role in protecting the red blood cell against
oxidizing agents; it is linked to chromosome X, and it may affects both sexes.
The clinically relevant manifestations, such as acute haemolytic anaemia, mainly 
occur in men, however. The 8-aminoquinoline primaquine, which is the medication
used in the radical treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, represents
the main factor that triggers complications associated with G6PDd. The current
study aims to estimate the costs of G6PDd among male individuals infected by P.
vivax in the Brazilian Amazon.
METHODS: This is an economic analysis developed within the Brazilian National
Health System perspective for the years of 2009, 2010 and 2011. Direct medical
and non-medical costs were estimated for G6PDd in the Brazilian Amazon,
considering among those suffering from the deficiency the costs of diagnosing
infection by P. vivax, its treatment and severe adverse events that require
hospitalization and were connected to the use of primaquine.
RESULTS: The estimates of the average costs of diagnosing vivax malaria, of its
treatment and of severe adverse events after using primaquine among the carriers 
of G6PDd, over the three evaluated years, corresponded to US$ 739,410.42; US$
2,120.04 and US$ 4,858,108.87, respectively. The results indicate that the
average total cost in the study period corresponded to US$ 5,599,639.33, varying 
in accordance with the sensitivity analysis between US$ 4,439,512.14 and US$
6,702,619.24.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the use of primaquine among men with G6PDd 
who are infected by P. vivax represents a heavy burden on the public health
service of Brazil.
