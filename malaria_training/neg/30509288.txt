BACKGROUND: This study aims to provide baseline data on the resistance status to 
insecticides, the frequency of mechanisms involved and the impact of the
association with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on resistant Anopheles
gambiae (s.l.) populations in two regions of northern Benin, prior to an indoor
residual spraying campaign and introduction of next generation long-lasting
insecticidal nets (LLINs) incorporating PBO.
METHODS: Adult Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) originating from larvae collected in two 
study regions (Alibori within the Kandi-Gogounou-Segbana districts and Donga
within the Djougou-Copargo-Ouake districts) were tested with impregnated papers
(bendiocarb 0.1%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25%, permethrin 0.75% and deltamethrin
0.05%). The synergist PBO was used to check for the involvement of detoxification
enzymes in pyrethroid resistant populations. Molecular analyses were performed
for the identification of species within the Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) complex and
kdr L1014F and G119S Ace-1 mutations. Biochemical assays assessed the activity of
detoxification enzymes.
RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) was resistant to pyrethroids, with a mortality 
range of 25-83% with deltamethrin and 6-55% with permethrin. A significant
increase in mortality was observed after pre-exposure to PBO for both
deltamethrin (63-99%) and permethrin (56-99%). With bendiocarb, An. gambiae
(s.l.) were susceptible in Kandi (99% mortality), with possible resistance
(92-95%) recorded in Djougou, Copargo, Gogounou, Ouake and Segbana. All study
populations were fully susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl. The frequencies of
resistant mutations varied according to species and sites: 0.67-0.88 for L1014F
kdr and 0-0.06 for G119S Ace-1. Three study locations (Djougou, Gogounou and
Kandi) showed high oxidase activity and four sites (Djougou, Ouake, Copargo and
Kandi) showed elevated esterase activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms resistance to pyrethroids and suggests emerging 
bendiocarb resistance in An. gambiae (s.l.) populations in northern Benin.
However, recovery of susceptibility to pyrethroids after PBO exposure, and
susceptibility to organophosphates in the An. gambiae (s.l.) populations indicate
that next generation LLINs incorporating PBO synergist combined with an indoor
residual spraying (IRS) campaign with organophosphate insecticides may be
regarded as alternative control tools.
