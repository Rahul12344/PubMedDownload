The heterochromatin environment plays a central role in silencing genes
associated with the malaria parasite's development, survival in the host, and
transmission to the mosquito vector. However, the underlying mechanism regulating
the dynamic chromatin structure is not understood yet. Here, we have uncovered
that Plasmodium falciparum Rrp6, an orthologue of eukaryotic RNA
exosome-associated RNase, controls the silencing of heterochromatic genes. PfRrp6
knockdown disrupted the singular expression of the GC-rich ncRNA RUF6 family, a
known critical regulator of virulence gene expression, through the stabilization 
of the nascent transcripts. Mechanistic investigation showed that the
accumulation of the multiple RUF6 ncRNAs triggered local chromatin remodeling in 
situ, which activated their adjacent var genes. Strikingly, chromatin isolation
by RNA purification analysis (ChIRP-seq) revealed that a remarkable RUF6 ncRNA
had interacted with distal heterochromatin regions directly and stimulated a
global derepression effect on heterochromatic genes, including all variant gene
families and the sexual commitment-associated regulator ap2-g gene. Collectively,
Rrp6 appears to conduct the epigenetic surveillance of heterochromatic gene
expression through controlling RUF6 levels, thereby securing antigenic variation 
and sexual commitment of malaria parasites during the infection of the
host.IMPORTANCE Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden. The
heterochromatin environment controls the silencing of genes associated with the
fate of malaria parasites. Previous studies have demonstrated that a group of
GC-rich ncRNAs (RUF6) is associated with the mutually exclusive expression of var
genes, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, through a series of
genetic manipulation and genome-wide multiomics analysis, we have identified the 
plasmodial orthologue of RNA exosome-associated Rrp6 as an upstream regulator of 
RUF6 expression and revealed that the dysregulation of RUF6 upon Rrp6 knockdown
triggered local chromatin alteration, thereby activating most heterochromatic
genes via direct interaction of RUF6 and distal gene loci. This finding not only 
uncovered the in-depth mechanism of RUF6-mediated regulation of heterochromatic
genes but also identified Rrp6 as a novel regulator of gene expression in human
malaria parasites, which provides a new target for developing intervention
strategies against malaria.
