BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation due
to immunological, microbial, and environmental factors in genetically predisposed
individuals. Advances in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of IBD require
the identification of robust biomarkers that can be used for molecular
classification of diverse disease presentations. We previously identified five
genes, RELA, TNFAIP3 (A20), PIGR, TNF, and IL8, whose mRNA levels in colonic
mucosal biopsies could be used in a multivariate analysis to classify patients
with CD based on disease behavior and responses to therapy.
AIM: We compared expression of these five biomarkers in IBD patients classified
as having CD or UC, and in healthy controls.
RESULTS: Patients with CD were characterized as having decreased median
expression of TNFAIP3, PIGR, and TNF in non-inflamed colonic mucosa as compared
to healthy controls. By contrast, UC patients exhibited decreased expression of
PIGR and elevated expression of IL8 in colonic mucosa compared to healthy
controls. A multivariate analysis combining mRNA levels for all five genes
resulted in segregation of individuals based on disease presentation (CD vs. UC) 
as well as severity, i.e., patients in remission versus those with acute colitis 
at the time of biopsy.
CONCLUSION: We propose that this approach could be used as a model for molecular 
classification of IBD patients, which could further be enhanced by the inclusion 
of additional genes that are identified by functional studies, global gene
expression analyses, and genome-wide association studies.
