BACKGROUND: Measurement of liver stage development is of key interest in malaria 
biology and vaccine studies. Parasite development in liver cells can be
visualized in real-time, both in culture and in live mice, using a transgenic
Plasmodium berghei parasite, PbGFP-Luccon, expressing the bioluminescent reporter
luciferase. This study explores the benefit of using these parasites for the
evaluation of immunity against malaria, compared to qRT-PCR techniques in vivo
and in vitro.
METHODS: Mice were immunized with either radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS)
or wildtype sporozoites under chloroquine prophylaxis (CPS) and challenged with
PbGFP-Luccon. The in vitro transgenic sporozoites neutralization assay (TSNA) was
adapted by replacing PbCS(Pf) parasites for PbGFP-Luccon parasites.
RESULTS: Application of PbGFP-Luccon transgenic parasites provides live
quantitative visual information about the relation between parasite liver load
and protection. Moreover, fast and reproducible results are obtained by using
these parasites in the transgenic sporozoites neutralization assay, measuring
functional antibody-mediated immune responses.
CONCLUSIONS: PbGFP-Luccon parasites are a straightforward and valuable tool for
comprehension of the biological and immunological principles underlying
protection against malaria.
