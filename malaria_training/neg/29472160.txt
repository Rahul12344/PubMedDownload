The intra-erythrocytic apicomplexan Babesia microti is the predominant pathogen
that causes human babesiosis, an infectious disease that occurs worldwide. B.
microti relies on the antioxidant including thioredoxin system to maintain the
redox balance during the erythrocytic stage. In the present study, the
full-length B. microti thioredoxin 3 (BmTrx3) gene was cloned, expressed in
vitro, and its response to antiprotozoal drugs were tested. The full-length
BmTrx3 was 663 bp and contained an intact open reading frame of 567 bp. The
encoded polypeptide was 188 amino acids and the predicted molecular weight of the
protein was 21.7 kDa. A conserved thioredoxin-like family domain was found in
BmTrx3. The expression of BmTrx3 was upregulated on both the third and eighth day
post-infection in mice, whereas expression was downregulated during the beginning
and later stages. Western blot analysis showed that mouse anti-BmTrx3 serum could
recognize the native BmTrx3 in parasite lysates and that the mouse anti-B.
microti serum could recognize the recombinant BmTrx3 protein. Immunofluorescence 
microscopy showed that BmTrx3 localized in the cell cytoplasm of B. microti
merozoites in B. microti-infected red blood cells. The results of bovine insulin 
reduction assay indicated the enzyme activity of the purified recombinant BmTrx3 
protein. The anti-malaria drug chloroquine significantly inhibited the expression
of BmTrx3, however, another anti-malaria drug qunine, and a known anti-babesiosis
drug clindamycin, induced significantly higher upregulation of BmTrx3 mRNA. The
results of the present study demonstrate that BmTrx3 is a functional enzyme with 
antioxidant activity and may be involved in the response of B. microti to
anti-parasite drugs.
