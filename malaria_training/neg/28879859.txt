Genome editing is unraveling its benefits in wide areas of scientific development
and understanding. The advances of genome editing from ZFNs and TALLENs to
CRISPRs defines it wide applicability. Reproduction is the fundamental process by
which all organisms maintain their generations. CRISPR/Cas9, a new versatile
genome editing tool is recently tamed to correct several disease causing genetic 
mutations spreading its arms to improve reproductive health. It not only edit
harmful genetic mutations but is also applied to control the spread of parasitic 
diseases like malaria by introducing selfish genetic elements, propagated through
generations and population via reproduction. These applications made us to review
the recent developments of CRISPRs use in reproductive biology.
