Pore forming proteins such as those belonging to the membrane attack/perforin
(MACPF) family have important functions in many organisms. Of the five MACPF
proteins found in Plasmodium parasites, three have functions in cell passage and 
one in host cell egress. Here we report an analysis of the perforin-like protein 
4, PPLP4, in the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. We found that the protein is
expressed only in the ookinete, the invasive stage of the parasite formed in the 
mosquito midgut. Transcriptional analysis revealed that expression of the pplp4
gene commences during ookinete development. The protein was detected in retorts
and mature ookinetes. Using two antibodies, the protein was found localized in a 
dotted pattern, and 3-D SIM super-resolution microcopy revealed the protein in
the periphery of the cell. Analysis of a C-terminal mCherry fusion of the protein
however showed mainly cytoplasmic label. A pplp4 null mutant formed motile
ookinetes, but these were unable to invade and traverse the midgut epithelium
resulting in severely impaired oocyst formation and no transmission to naïve
mice. However, when in vitro cultured ookinetes were injected into the thorax of 
the mosquito, thus by-passing midgut passage, sporozoites were formed and the
mutant parasites were able to infect naïve mice. Taken together, our data show
that PPLP4 is required only for ookinete invasion of the mosquito midgut. Thus
PPLP4 has a similar role to the previously studied PPLP3 and PPLP5, raising the
question why three proteins with MACPF domains are needed for invasion by the
ookinete of the mosquito midgut epithelium.
