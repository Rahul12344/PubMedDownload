We showed previously that ingested human insulin activates the insulin/IGF-1
signaling pathway in Anopheles stephensi and increases the susceptibility of
these mosquitoes to Plasmodium falciparum. In other organisms, insulin can alter 
immune responsiveness through regulation of NF-κB transcription factors, critical
elements for innate immunity that are also central to mosquito immunity. We show 
here that insulin signaling decreased expression of NF-κB-regulated immune genes 
in mosquito cells stimulated with either bacterial or malarial soluble products. 
Further, human insulin suppressed mosquito immunity through sustained
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, since inhibition of this pathway led to
decreased parasite development in the mosquito. Together, these data demonstrate 
that activation of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway by ingested human insulin 
can alter NF-κB-dependent immunity, and ultimately the susceptibility, of
mosquitoes to P. falciparum.
