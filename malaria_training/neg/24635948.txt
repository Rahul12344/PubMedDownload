BACKGROUND: Cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to
endothelial cells in microvessels is a remarkable characteristic of severe
malaria. The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), encoded by the endothelial
protein C receptor gene (PROCR), has recently been identified as an endothelial
receptor for specific P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)
subtypes containing domain cassettes (DCs) 8 and 13. The PROCR rs867186-G allele 
(serine-to-glycine substitution at position 219 of EPCR; 219Gly) has been shown
to be associated with higher levels of plasma soluble EPCR (sEPCR). In this
study, the association of PROCR rs867186 with severe malaria is examined in Thai 
population.
METHODS: A total of 707 Thai patients with P. falciparum malaria (341 with severe
malaria and 336 with mild malaria) were genotyped for rs867186. To assess the
association of PROCR rs867186 with severe malaria, three models (dominant,
recessive and allelic) were evaluated. The rates of non-synonymous and synonymous
substitutions were estimated for the coding sequence of the PROCR gene.
RESULTS: The rs867186-GG genotype was significantly associated with protection
from severe malaria (P-value=0.026; odds ratio=0.33; 95% confidence
interval=0.12-0.90). Evolutionary analysis provided no evidence of strong
positive selection acting on the PROCR gene.
CONCLUSION: The rs867186-GG genotype showed significant association with
protection from severe malaria. The present results suggest that PfEMP1-EPCR
interaction, which can mediate cytoadhesion and/or reduce cytoprotective and
anti-inflammatory effects, is crucial to the pathogenesis of severe malaria.
