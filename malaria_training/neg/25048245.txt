Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax (Pv),
serves as a drug target and immunodiagnostic marker. The LDH cDNA generated from 
total RNA of a clinical isolate of the parasite was cloned into pRSETA plasmid.
Recombinant his-tagged PvLDH was over-expressed in E. coli Rosetta2DE3pLysS and
purified using Ni(2+)-NTA resin giving a yield of 25-30 mg/litre bacterial
culture. The recombinant protein was enzymatically active and its catalytic
efficiency for pyruvate was 5.4 × 10(8) min(-1) M(-1), 14.5 fold higher than a
low yield preparation reported earlier to obtain PvLDH crystal structure. The
enzyme activity was inhibited by gossypol and sodium oxamate. The recombinant
PvLDH was reactive in lateral flow immunochromatographic assays detecting pan-
and vivax-specific LDH. The soluble recombinant PvLDH purified using heterologous
expression system can facilitate the generation of vivax LDH-specific monoclonals
and the screening of chemical compound libraries for PvLDH inhibitors.
