The development of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors threatens
the continued efficacy of important vector control methods that rely on a limited
set of insecticides. To understand the operational significance of resistance we 
require quantitative information about levels of resistance in field populations 
to the suite of vector control insecticides. Estimation of resistance is
complicated by the sparsity of observations in field populations, variation in
resistance over time and space at local and regional scales, and cross-resistance
between different insecticide types. Using observations of the prevalence of
resistance in mosquito species from the Anopheles gambiae complex sampled from
1,183 locations throughout Africa, we applied Bayesian geostatistical models to
quantify patterns of covariation in resistance phenotypes across different
insecticides. For resistance to the three pyrethroids tested, deltamethrin,
permethrin, and λ-cyhalothrin, we found consistent forms of covariation across
sub-Saharan Africa and covariation between resistance to these pyrethroids and
resistance to DDT. We found no evidence of resistance interactions between
carbamate and organophosphate insecticides or between these insecticides and
those from other classes. For pyrethroids and DDT we found significant
associations between predicted mean resistance and the observed frequency of kdr 
mutations in the Vgsc gene in field mosquito samples, with DDT showing the
strongest association. These results improve our capacity to understand and
predict resistance patterns throughout Africa and can guide the development of
monitoring strategies.
