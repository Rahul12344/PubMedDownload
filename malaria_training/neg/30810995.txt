Malaria is one of the most important human diseases throughout tropical and
sub-tropical regions of the world. Global distribution and ample host range have 
contributed to the genetic diversity of the etiological agent, Plasmodium.
Phylogeographical analyses demonstrated that Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
vivax follow an Out of Africa (OOA) expansion, having a higher genetic diversity 
in African populations and a low genetic diversity in South American populations.
Modeling the evolutionary rate of conserved genes for both P. falciparum and P.
vivax determined the approximate arrival of human malaria in South America.
Bayesian computational methods suggest that P. falciparum originated in Africa
and arrived in South America through multiple independent introductions by the
transatlantic African slave trade; however, in South America, P. vivax could have
been introduced through an alternate migratory route. Alignments of P. vivax
mitogenomes have revealed low genetic variation between the South American and
Southeast Asian populations suggesting introduction through either pre-Columbian 
human migration or post-colonization events. To confirm the findings of these
phylogeographical analyses, molecular methods were used to diagnose malaria
infection in archeological remains of pre-Columbian ethnic groups.
Immunohistochemistry tests were used and identified P. vivax but not P.
falciparum in histologically prepared tissues from pre-Columbian Peruvian
mummies, whereas shotgun metagenomics sequencing of DNA isolated from
pre-Columbian Caribbean coprolites revealed Plasmodium-homologous reads; current 
evidence suggests that only P. vivax might have been present in pre-Columbian
South America.
