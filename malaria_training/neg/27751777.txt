Rhomboid proteins are considered to be the most widespread membrane proteins
across all forms of life. This superfamily comprises both active intramembrane
serine proteases that catalyze the release of factors from the membrane, and a
eukaryotic subset of non-catalytic members in which rhomboid architecture
supports deviating functions. Although rhomboid was discovered in genetic studies
of insect development, rhomboid research has broadened dramatically over the past
15 years; rhomboid enzymes are now the best biophysically understood of all
intramembrane proteases, and are considered promising therapeutic targets for
diseases ranging from parasitic infections to Parkinsonian neurodegeneration.
Perhaps the most rapid progress has come with the catalytically inert rhomboid
proteins, some of which regulate protein trafficking and/or function, and their
prominence is underscored by clinical mutations. Such a diverse collection of
advances mark an excellent point to review the state of this vibrant area of
research, not because central questions have been answered, but instead because a
firm grip in key areas has been established, and the field is now poised for
breakthroughs.
