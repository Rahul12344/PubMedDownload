An endophytic actinomycete strain BCC72023 was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa
L.) and identified as the genus Streptomyces, based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic
and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. The strain showed 99.80% similarity compared
with Streptomyces samsunensis M1463(T). Chemical investigation led to the
isolation of three macrolides, efomycins M (1), G (2) and oxohygrolidin (3),
along with two polyethers, abierixin (4) and 29-O-methylabierixin (5). To our
knowledge, this is the first report of efomycin M being isolated from a natural
source. The compounds were identified using spectroscopic techniques and
comparison with previously published data. All compounds exhibited antimalarial
activity against the Plasmodium falciparum, K-1 strain, a multidrug-resistant
strain, with IC50 values in a range of 1.40-5.23 μg/ml. In addition, these
compounds were evaluated for biological activity against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Bacillus cereus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum 
capsici, as well as cytotoxicity against both cancerous (MCF-7, KB, NCI-H187) and
non-cancerous (Vero) cells.
