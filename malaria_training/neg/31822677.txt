The blood-feeding behavior of Anopheles females delivers essential nutrients for 
egg development and drives parasite transmission between humans. Plasmodium
growth is adapted to the vector reproductive cycle, but how changes in the
reproductive cycle impact parasite development remains unclear. Here, we show
that the bloodmeal-induced miR-276-5p fine-tunes the expression of branched-chain
amino acid transferase to terminate the reproductive cycle. Silencing of miR-276 
prolongs high rates of amino acid (AA) catabolism and increases female fertility,
suggesting that timely termination of AA catabolism restricts mosquito investment
into reproduction. Prolongation of AA catabolism in P. falciparum-infected
females also compromises the development of the transmissible sporozoite forms.
Our results suggest that Plasmodium sporogony exploits the surplus mosquito
resources available after reproductive investment and demonstrate the crucial
role of the mosquito AA metabolism in within-vector parasite proliferation and
malaria transmission.
