BACKGROUND: Nearly half of the world's population (3.2 billion people) were at
risk of malaria in 2015, and resistance to current therapies is a major concern. 
While the standard of care includes drug combinations, there is a pressing need
to identify new combinations that can bypass current resistance mechanisms. In
the work presented here, a combined transcriptional drug repositioning/discovery 
and machine learning approach is proposed.
METHODS: The integrated approach utilizes gene expression data from
patient-derived samples, in combination with large-scale anti-malarial
combination screening data, to predict synergistic compound combinations for
three Plasmodium falciparum strains (3D7, DD2 and HB3). Both single compounds and
combinations predicted to be active were prospectively tested in experiment.
RESULTS: One of the predicted single agents, apicidin, was active with the AC50
values of 74.9, 84.1 and 74.9 nM in 3D7, DD2 and HB3 P. falciparum strains while 
its maximal safe plasma concentration in human is 547.6 ± 136.6 nM. Apicidin at
the safe dose of 500 nM kills on average 97% of the parasite. The synergy
prediction algorithm exhibited overall precision and recall of 83.5 and 65.1% for
mild-to-strong, 48.8 and 75.5% for moderate-to-strong and 12.0 and 62.7% for
strong synergies. Some of the prospectively predicted combinations, such as
tacrolimus-hydroxyzine and raloxifene-thioridazine, exhibited significant synergy
across the three P. falciparum strains included in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic approaches can play an important role in accelerating
discovering novel combinational therapies for malaria as it enables selecting
novel synergistic compound pairs in a more informed and cost-effective manner.
