The data presented in this article is associated with the quantitative proteomic 
analysis of four mosquito tissues - midgut, Malpighian tubules, ovaries and fat
body from female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. To identify the proteins that
were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, the four mosquito tissues were
labelled with iTRAQ labels and analyzed using a high-resolution mass
spectrometer. Database searches of the 1,10,616 raw spectra from 23 peptide
fractions resulted in the identification of 84,733 peptide spectrum matches
corresponding to 16,278 peptides and 3372 proteins. Of these, 959 proteins were
found to be differentially expressed across the tissues. Gene ontology-based
bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed proteins are also provided
in the article. The data in this article has been deposited in the
(ProteomeXchange) Consortium via the PRIDE repository and can be accessed through
the accession ID, PXD001128.
