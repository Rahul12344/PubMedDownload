Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1, encoded by var gene, is an 
immunodominant antigen mediating immune evasion in humans. At a given time, only 
a single var gene is commonly expressed in one parasite. However, the regulation 
mechanism of var transcription remains largely unknown. In this study, we
identified the antisense long non-coding RNA (aslncRNA) derived from var intron
as an activation factor for the corresponding var gene. The exogenous artificial 
var aslncRNA transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from episome can specifically
activate the homologous var gene, and the exogenous aslncRNA activates
transcription of both var mRNA and endogenous aslncRNA in a manner independent of
the conserved intron sequence within the var gene family. Interestingly, the
newly activated var gene and the previously dominant var gene then could be
co-expressed in the same parasite nuclei, which suggests that the
aslncRNA-mediated var gene activation could escape from the control of mutually
exclusively expression of the var gene family. Together, our work shows that var 
aslncRNA is the activator responsible for var gene transcriptional regulation.
