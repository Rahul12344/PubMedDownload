BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 3α (PvMSP3α) is a
promising vaccine candidate which has shown strong association with
immunogenicity and protectiveness. Its use is however complicated by evolutionary
plasticity features which enhance immune evasion. Low complexity regions (LCRs)
provide plasticity in surface proteins of Plasmodium species, but its implication
in vaccine design remain unexplored. Here population genetic, comparative
phylogenetic and structural biology analysis was performed on the gene encoding
PvMSP3α.
RESULTS: Three LCRs were found in PvMSP3α block II. Both the predicted tertiary
structure of the protein and the phylogenetic trees based on this region were
influenced by the presence of the LCRs. The LCRs were mainly B cell epitopes
within or adjacent. In addition a repeat motif mimicking one of the B cell
epitopes was found within the PvMSP3a block II low complexity region. This
particular B cell epitope also featured rampant alanine substitutions which might
impair antibody binding.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that PvMSP3α block II possesses LCRs which
might confer a strong phenotypic plasticity. The phenomenon of phenotypic
plasticity and implication of LCRs in malaria immunology in general and vaccine
candidate genes in particular merits further exploration.
