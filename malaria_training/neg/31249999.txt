BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) that target histidine-rich
protein 2 (HRP2) are important tools for Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis.
Parasites with pfhrp2/3 gene deletions threaten the use of these mRDTs and have
been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America. We studied blood samples from 3
African countries to determine if these gene deletions were present.
METHODS: We analyzed 911 dried blood spots from Ghana (n = 165), Tanzania (n =
176), and Uganda (n = 570). Plasmodium falciparum infection was confirmed by 18S 
rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and pfhrp2/3 genes were genotyped. True
pfhrp2/3 gene deletions were confirmed if samples were (1) microscopy positive;
(2) 18S rDNA PCR positive; (3) positive for merozoite surface protein genes by
PCR or positive by loop-mediated isothermal amplification; or (4) quantitative
PCR positive with >5 parasites/µL.
RESULTS: No pfhrp2/3 deletions were detected in samples from Ghana, but deletions
were identified in Tanzania (3 pfhrp2; 2 pfhrp3) and Uganda (7 pfhrp2; 2 pfhrp3).
Of the 10 samples with pfhrp2 deletions, 9 tested negative by HRP2-based mRDT.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pfhrp2/3 deletions in Tanzania and Uganda, along
with reports of pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites in neighboring countries, reinforces
the need for systematic surveillance to monitor the reliability of mRDTs in
malaria-endemic countries.
