Insects are considered pests globally, implicated in the destruction of
agricultural fields and transmission of pathogens that cause deadly human
diseases, such as dengue, Zika and malaria. The diversity of the insecticide
arsenal has remained stagnant for decades, but the recent rise of insecticide
resistance fueled the discovery of novel modes of action, and the power of
genomics has reinvigorated this search. This review discusses the importance of
comparative and functional insect genomics in the identification of potential
gene targets for an insecticidal mode of action with low off-target toxicity. Due
to the global participation in the sequencing and annotation of insect genomes,
the targeting of specific genes with molecular tools like RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9
for genome engineering and consequent functional identification and validation
has become more efficient. While there are multiple avenues to explore for
insecticidal candidates, this review identifies G-protein coupled receptors as
attractive targets, and hones in on the octopamine and dopamine receptors due to 
their potential.
