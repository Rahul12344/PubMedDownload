Besnoitia besnoiti is an apicomplexan parasite responsible for bovine
besnoitiosis, a chronic and debilitating disease that causes systemic and skin
manifestations and sterility in bulls. Neither treatments nor vaccines are
currently available. In the search for therapeutic candidates, calcium-dependent 
protein kinases have arisen as promising drug targets in other apicomplexans
(e.g. Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium spp. and Eimeria spp.) and 
are effectively targeted by bumped kinase inhibitors. In this study, we
identified and cloned the gene coding for BbCDPK1. The impact of a library of
nine bumped kinase inhibitor analogues on the activity of recombinant BbCDPK1 was
assessed by luciferase assay. Afterwards, those were further screened for
efficacy against Besnoitiabesnoiti tachyzoites grown in Marc-145 cells. Primary
tests at 5µM revealed that eight compounds exhibited more than 90% inhibition of 
invasion and proliferation. The compounds BKI 1294, 1517, 1553 and 1571 were
further characterised, and EC99 (1294: 2.38µM; 1517: 2.20µM; 1553: 3.34µM; 1571: 
2.78µM) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in
3-day proliferation assays. Exposure of infected cultures with EC99
concentrations of these drugs for up to 48h was not parasiticidal. The lack of
parasiticidal action was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, which
showed that bumped kinase inhibitor treatment interfered with cell cycle
regulation and non-disjunction of tachyzoites, resulting in the formation of
large multi-nucleated complexes which co-existed with viable parasites within the
parasitophorous vacuole. However, it is possible that, in the face of an active
immune response, parasite clearance may occur. In summary, bumped kinase
inhibitors may be effective drug candidates to control Besnoitiabesnoiti
infection. Further in vivo experiments should be planned, as attainment and
maintenance of therapeutic blood plasma levels in calves, without toxicity, has
been demonstrated for BKIs 1294, 1517 and 1553.
