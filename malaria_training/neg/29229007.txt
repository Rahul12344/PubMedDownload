Parasites often have reduced genomes as their own genes become redundant when
utilizing their host as a source of metabolites, thus losing their own de novo
production of metabolites. Primate malaria parasites can synthesize vitamin B1
(thiamine) de novo but rodent malaria and other genome-sequenced apicomplexans
cannot, as the three essential genes responsible for this pathway are absent in
their genomes. The unique presence of functional thiamine synthesis genes in
primate malaria parasites and their sequence similarities to bacterial
orthologues, have led to speculations that this pathway was horizontally acquired
from bacteria. Here we show that the genes essential for the de novo synthesis of
thiamine are found also in avian Plasmodium species. Importantly, they are also
present in species phylogenetically basal to all mammalian and avian Plasmodium
parasites, i.e. Haemoproteus. Furthermore, we found that these genes are
expressed during the blood stage of the avian malaria infection, indicating that 
this metabolic pathway is actively transcribed. We conclude that the ability to
synthesize thiamine is widespread among haemosporidians, with a recent loss in
the rodent malaria species.
