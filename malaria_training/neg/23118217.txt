The mechanisms underlying Plasmodium falciparum resistance in persons with sickle
trait have been under active investigation for more than a half century. This
Perspective reviews progress in solving this challenging problem, including
recent studies that have exploited the genomics and proteomics of the parasite.
The formation of Hb S polymer in the parasitized AS RBC leads to impaired
parasite growth and development along with enhanced clearance from the
circulation and reduced deposition in deep postcapillary vascular beds. Enhanced 
generation of reactive oxygen species in sickled AS RBCs is a pathogenetic
feature shared by parasitized thalassemic and G6PD-deficient RBCs, triggering
abnormal topology of the RBC plasma membrane with decreased and disordered
display of PfEMP-1, a P falciparum adhesion protein critical for endothelial
adherence. A mouse model of Hb S confers host tolerance to P berghei, through
inhibition of pathogenic CD8(+) T cells and induction of heme oxygenase-1. An
additional and apparently independent mode of protection is provided by the
selective expression in AS RBCs of 2 species of microRNA that integrate into P
falciparum mRNAs and inhibit translation and parasite growth.
