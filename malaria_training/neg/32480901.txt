Microarray analysis was used to investigate changes in host gene expression
during the primary stages of the interaction between the susceptible plant
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh ecotype Col-0 and the biotrophic pathogen
Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin. Analyses were conducted at 4, 7 and 10 days
after inoculation (DAI) and revealed significant induction or suppression of a
relatively low number of genes in a range of functional categories. At 4 DAI,
there was induced expression of several genes known to be critical for pathogen
recognition and signal transduction in other resistant host-pathogen
interactions. As the pathogen further colonised root tissue and progressed
through the primary plasmodium stage to production of zoosporangia at 7 and 10
DAI, respectively, fewer genes showed changes in expression. The microarray
results were validated by examining a subset of induced genes at 4 DAI by
quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis all of which 
correlated positively with the microarray data. The two A. thaliana mutants jar1 
and coiI tested were found to be susceptible to P. brassicae. The involvement of 
defence-related hormones in the interaction was further investigated and the
findings indicate that addition of salicylic acid can suppress clubroot disease
in A. thaliana plants.
