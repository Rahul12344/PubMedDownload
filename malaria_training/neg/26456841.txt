Antigens encoded by the var gene family are major virulence factors of the human 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, exhibiting enormous intra- and
interstrain diversity. Here we use network analysis to show that var architecture
and mosaicism are conserved at multiple levels across the Laverania subgenus,
based on var-like sequences from eight single-species and three multi-species
Plasmodium infections of wild-living or sanctuary African apes. Using select
whole-genome amplification, we also find evidence of multi-domain var structure
and synteny in Plasmodium gaboni, one of the ape Laverania species most distantly
related to P. falciparum, as well as a new class of Duffy-binding-like domains.
These findings indicate that the modular genetic architecture and sequence
diversity underlying var-mediated host-parasite interactions evolved before the
radiation of the Laverania subgenus, long before the emergence of P. falciparum.
