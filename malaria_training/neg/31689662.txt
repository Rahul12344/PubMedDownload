In this study, we investigated morphological, immunological and molecular
characteristics of Colpodella sp. (American Type Culture Collection 50594) in a
diprotist culture containing Bodo caudatus as prey using Plasmodium rhoptry
specific antibodies and oligonucleotide primers targeting Plasmodium falciparum
rhoptry genes. In culture, Colpodella sp. attached to its prey using the apical
end with attachment lasting for approximately 20 min while the cytoplasmic
contents of the prey were aspirated into the posterior food vacuole of Colpodella
sp. Encystment of Colpodella sp. was observed following feeding. Indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and confocal microscopy using P. falciparum
rhoptry specific antibodies showed intense reactivity with cytoplasmic vesicles
of Colpodella sp. Bodo caudatus from diprotist and monoprotist (ATCC 30395)
cultures showed weak background reactivity. Giemsa staining permitted
differentiation of both protists. Genomic DNA isolated from the diprotist culture
was used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers
targeting the P. falciparum rhoptry genes RhopH3, RhopH1/Clag3.2 and RAMA.
Primers targeting exon 7 of the P. falciparum RhopH3 gene amplified an
approximately 2 kb DNA fragment from the diprotist DNA template. DNA sequence and
BLAST search analysis of the amplified product from diprotist DNA identified the 
RhopH3 gene demonstrating that the RhopH3 gene is conserved in Colpodella sp.
