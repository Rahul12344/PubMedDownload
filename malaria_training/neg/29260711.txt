Darwinian fitness is a central concept in evolutionary biology. In practice,
however, it is hardly possible to measure fitness for all genotypes in a natural 
population. Here, we present quantitative tools to make inferences about
epistatic gene interactions when the fitness landscape is only incompletely
determined due to imprecise measurements or missing observations. We demonstrate 
that genetic interactions can often be inferred from fitness rank orders, where
all genotypes are ordered according to fitness, and even from partial fitness
orders. We provide a complete characterization of rank orders that imply higher
order epistasis. Our theory applies to all common types of gene interactions and 
facilitates comprehensive investigations of diverse genetic interactions. We
analyzed various genetic systems comprising HIV-1, the malaria-causing parasite
Plasmodium vivax, the fungus Aspergillus niger, and the TEM-family of Î²-lactamase
associated with antibiotic resistance. For all systems, our approach revealed
higher order interactions among mutations.
