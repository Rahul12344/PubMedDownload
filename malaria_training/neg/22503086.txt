The mitochondrial electron transport chain is essential to Plasmodium and is the 
target of the antimalarial drug atovaquone. The mitochondrial genomes of
Plasmodium sp. are the most reduced known, and the majority of mitochondrial
proteins are encoded in the nucleus and imported into the mitochondrion
post-translationally. Many organisms have signalling pathways between the
mitochondria and the nucleus to regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded
mitochondrially-targeted proteins, for example in response to mitochondrial
dysfunction. We have studied the transcript profiles of synchronous Plasmodium
falciparum treated with an LD(50) concentration of the complex III inhibitor
antimycin A, to investigate whether such pathways exist in the parasite. There
was a broad perturbation of gene expression. The differentially expressed genes
were enriched for transcripts encoding proteins involved in invasion, stress
response, nucleotide biosynthesis and respiration. Some effects were attributable
to a delay in the gene expression phase of drug-treated parasites. However, our
data indicated regulation of mitochondrial stress response genes and genes
involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, implying the existence of a signalling
pathway from the mitochondrion to the nucleus.
