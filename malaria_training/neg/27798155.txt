Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a deadly infectious disease in which Abs play a 
critical role in naturally acquired immunity. However, the specificity and nature
of Abs elicited in response to malaria are only partially understood.
Autoreactivity and polyreactivity are common features of Ab responses in several 
infections and were suggested to contribute to effective pathogen-specific Ab
responses. In this article, we report on the regulation of B cells expressing the
inherently autoreactive VH4-34 H chain (identified by the 9G4 mAb) and 9G4+
plasma IgG in adults and children living in a P. falciparum malaria-endemic area 
in West Africa. The frequency of 9G4+ peripheral blood CD19+ B cells was similar 
in United States adults and African adults and children; however, more 9G4+ B
cells appeared in classical and atypical memory B cell compartments in African
children and adults compared with United States adults. The levels of 9G4+ IgG
increased following acute febrile malaria but did not increase with age as
humoral immunity is acquired or correlate with protection from acute disease.
This was the case, even though a portion of 9G4+ B cells acquired phenotypes of
atypical and classical memory B cells and 9G4+ IgG contained equivalent numbers
of somatic hypermutations compared with all other VHs, a characteristic of
secondary Ab repertoire diversification in response to Ag stimulation.
Determining the origin and function of 9G4+ B cells and 9G4+ IgG in malaria may
contribute to a better understanding of the varied roles of autoreactivity in
infectious diseases.
