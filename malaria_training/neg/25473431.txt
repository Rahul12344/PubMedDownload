The development of the CRISPR-Cas system is revolutionizing genome editing in a
variety of organisms. The system has now been used to manipulate the genome of
Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria-causing species. The ability to
generate gene deletions or nucleotide substitutions rapidly and economically
promises to accelerate the analysis of novel drug targets and to help elucidate
the function of specific genes or gene families, while complementing genome-wide 
association studies.
