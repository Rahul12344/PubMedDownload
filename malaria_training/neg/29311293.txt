Efforts to knock out Plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1
(PfCDPK1) from asexual erythrocytic stage have not been successful, indicating an
indispensable role of the enzyme in asexual growth. We recently reported
generation of a transgenic parasite with mutant CDPK1 [Bansal A, et al. (2016)
MBio 7:e02011-16]. The mutant CDPK1 (T145M) had reduced activity of
transphosphorylation. We reasoned that CDPK1 could be disrupted in the mutant
parasites. Consistent with this assumption, CDPK1 was successfully disrupted in
the mutant parasites using CRISPR/Cas9. We and others could not disrupt PfCDPK1
in the WT parasites. The CDPK1 KO parasites show a slow growth rate compared with
the WT and the CDPK1 T145M parasites. Additionally, the CDPK1 KO parasites show a
defect in both male and female gametogenesis and could not establish an infection
in mosquitoes. Complementation of the KO parasite with full-length PfCDPK1
partially rescued the asexual growth defect and mosquito infection. Comparative
global transcriptomics of WT and the CDPK1 KO schizonts using RNA-seq show
significantly high transcript expression of gametocyte-specific genes in the
CDPK1 KO parasites. This study conclusively demonstrates that CDPK1 is a good
target for developing transmission-blocking drugs.
