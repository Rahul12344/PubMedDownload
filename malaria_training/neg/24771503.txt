BACKGROUND: Malaria can be diagnosed in saliva and urine using mitochondrial PCR 
detection of Plasmodium DNA.
METHODS: Blood, saliva and urine were collected from 99 febrile patients referred
to health centers in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, southeastern Iran, from May
to November 2011. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax was targeted in saliva, urine and blood samples using nested
PCR.
RESULTS: Nested PCR proved to be more sensitive than microscopy for the diagnosis
of sub-microscopic and mixed-species infections. The results of nested PCR
amplifications of saliva and urine samples showed the same specificity of 97% and
sensitivity of 91% and 70%, respectively. Nested PCR amplifications of saliva
samples and microscopy showed the greatest area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and were more accurate than nested PCR amplifications 
of urine samples.
CONCLUSION: Nested PCR amplification of saliva samples showed good levels of
detection of mitochondrial Plasmodium DNA as compared to nested PCR of blood
(к=0.84; AUC=0.94), which was used as a reference standard. Based on the results 
of nested PCR as well as the advantages of saliva sampling, we suggest that
saliva could be an alternative to blood, in malaria diagnosis, in cases where
repeat sampling is required. Further studies are needed to validate these
findings.
