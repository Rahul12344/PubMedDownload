The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, has re-established itself as a ubiquitous human
ectoparasite throughout much of the world during the past two decades. This
global resurgence is likely linked to increased international travel and commerce
in addition to widespread insecticide resistance. Analyses of the C. lectularius 
sequenced genome (650 Mb) and 14,220 predicted protein-coding genes provide a
comprehensive representation of genes that are linked to traumatic insemination, 
a reduced chemosensory repertoire of genes related to obligate hematophagy,
host-symbiont interactions, and several mechanisms of insecticide resistance. In 
addition, we document the presence of multiple putative lateral gene transfer
events. Genome sequencing and annotation establish a solid foundation for future 
research on mechanisms of insecticide resistance, human-bed bug and symbiont-bed 
bug associations, and unique features of bed bug biology that contribute to the
unprecedented success of C. lectularius as a human ectoparasite.
