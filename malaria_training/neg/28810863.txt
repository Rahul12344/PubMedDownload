BACKGROUND: The phylum Apicomplexa includes intracellular parasites causing
immense global disease burden, the deadliest of them being the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which invades and replicates within erythrocytes.
The cytoskeletal protein actin is well conserved within apicomplexans but
divergent from mammalian actins, and was primarily reported to function during
host cell invasion. However, novel invasion mechanisms have been described for
several apicomplexans, and specific functions of the acto-myosin system are being
reinvestigated. Of the two actin genes in P. falciparum, actin-1 (pfact1) is
ubiquitously expressed in all life-cycle stages and is thought to be required for
erythrocyte invasion, although its functions during parasite development are
unknown, and definitive in vivo characterisation during invasion is lacking.
RESULTS: Here we have used a conditional Cre-lox system to investigate the
functions of PfACT1 during P. falciparum blood-stage development and host cell
invasion. We demonstrate that PfACT1 is crucially required for segregation of the
plastid-like organelle, the apicoplast, and for efficient daughter cell
separation during the final stages of cytokinesis. Surprisingly, we observe that 
egress from the host cell is not an actin-dependent process. Finally, we show
that parasites lacking PfACT1 are capable of microneme secretion, attachment and 
formation of a junction with the erythrocyte, but are incapable of host cell
invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important mechanistic insights into the
definitive essential functions of PfACT1 in P. falciparum, which are not only of 
biological interest, but owing to functional divergence from mammalian actins,
could also form the basis for the development of novel therapeutics against
apicomplexans.
