Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria and is responsible
for essentially all malaria-related deaths. The accumulation in various tissues
of erythrocytes infected by mature P. falciparum parasites can lead to
circulatory disturbances and inflammation, and is thought to be a central element
in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is mediated by the interaction of parasite
ligands on the erythrocyte surface and a range of host receptor molecules in many
organs and tissues. Among several proteins and protein families implicated in
this process, the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of
high-molecular weight and highly variable antigens appears to be the most
prominent. In this chapter, we aim to provide a systematic overview of the
current knowledge about these proteins, their structure, their function, how they
are presented on the erythrocyte surface, and how the var genes encoding them are
regulated. The role of PfEMP1 in the pathogenesis of malaria, PfEMP1-specific
immune responses, and the prospect of PfEMP1-specific vaccination against malaria
are also covered briefly.
