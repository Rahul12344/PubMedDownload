Artemisinin is biosynthesized in Artemisia annua and widely used for the
treatment of malaria. Abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive kinase 1 (AaAPK1), a member 
of the SnRK2 family, is involved in the regulation of artemisinin biosynthesis
through the phosphorylation of AabZIP1, which directly transactivates genes
involved in artemisinin biosynthesis. Through diverse assays - including yeast
two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays - we report that
the ABA-responsive protein phosphatase AaPP2C1 physically interacts with AaAPK1. 
In addition, phos-tag mobility shift assays indicate that AaPP2C1
dephosphorylates AaAPK1. Moreover, dual-luciferase assays demonstrate that the
presence of AaPP2C1 reduces the transactivation of artemisinin biosynthesis genes
by AabZIP1. These results further refine the post-translational regulatory
network of artemisinin biosynthesis, showing that AaPP2C1 is negatively involved 
through dephosphorylation of AaAPK1.
