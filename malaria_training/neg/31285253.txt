Antibodies to AgTRIO, a mosquito salivary protein, partially reduce the initial
Plasmodium burden in mice. We therefore silenced AgTRIO in mosquitoes and
determined the relative contribution of AgTRIO to the ability of Anopheles
gambiae to transmit Plasmodium berghei to mice. RNA interference-mediated
silencing of AgTRIO in A. gambiae resulted in a 60% reduction in AgTRIO
expression. The decrease in AgTRIO expression did not alter the burden of
Plasmodium sporozoites in mosquito salivary glands. When experimentally injected 
into mice, sporozoites from AgTRIO-silenced mosquitoes colonized the liver less
effectively than sporozoites from control mosquitoes. Silencing of AgTRIO did not
decrease the infectivity of sporozoites in vitro or influence the expression of
genes associated with Plasmodium cell adhesion or traversal activity. AgTRIO
decreased the expression of proinflammation cytokines by splenocytes in vitro
Moreover, in vivo, AgTRIO decreased the expression of TNF-α when coinjected with 
sporozoites into the skin and there was more TNF-α expression at the bite site of
AgTRIO knockdown mosquitoes than at the bite site of control mosquitoes. AgTRIO
therefore influences the local environment in the vertebrate host, which
facilitates Plasmodium sporozoite infection in mice.
