The prevalence of malaria in India is decreasing, but it remains a major concern 
for public health administration. The role of submicroscopic malaria and
asymptomatic malaria parasitemia and their persistence is being explored. A
cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Kandhamal district of Odisha (India) 
during May-June 2017. Blood samples were collected from 1897 individuals for
screening of asymptomatic parasitemia. Samples were screened using rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) and examined microscopically for Plasmodium species.
Approximately 30% of randomly selected samples (n = 586) were analyzed using
real-time PCR (qPCR), and the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum was
analyzed. The prevalence of Plasmodium species among asymptomatic individuals
detected using qPCR was 18%, which was significantly higher than that detected by
microscopy examination (5.5%) or RDT (7.3%). Of these, 37% had submicroscopic
malaria. The species-specific prevalence among asymptomatic malaria-positive
cases for P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and mixed infection (P. falciparum and
P. vivax) by qPCR was 57%, 29%, and 14%, respectively. The multiplicity of
infection was 1.6 and 1.2 for the merozoite surface protein-1 gene (msp1) and
(msp2), respectively. Expected heterozygosity was 0.64 and 0.47 for msp1 and
msp2, respectively. A significant proportion of the study population, 105/586
(18%), was found to be a reservoir for malaria infection, and identification of
this group will help in the development of elimination strategies.
