The objective of this work was to compare the quality, purity and quantity of DNA
isolated from dried blood spots (DBS) by three methods (Chelex-100, QIAamp DNA
mini kit, and TE (Tris EDTA)-Buffer). Sample collection was performed in six
districts in Odisha, India and screened for cases of clinical malaria and dengue 
and vector density. Mosquito abdomens were spotted on Whatman 3MM (MERCK) Filter 
paper and dried for 10 min at room temperature. DNA was isolated from DBS using
three methods (Chelex-100, QIAamp DNA mini kit, and TE-Buffer), and PCR was used 
to determine the feeding behaviours of vector mosquitoes. DNA was quantified
using a UV-spectrophotometer, and q-PCR was used to determine the target gene
copy number to compare the methods. The QIAamp DNA mini kit method was used as
the reference method. The yield and purity of DNA extracted with Chelex-100 and
TE were 14-72 ng/µl and 1.51-1.85 and 9-50 ng/µl and 1.68-2.1, respectively. DNA 
extracted using the Chelex-100 method was stored for over 1 month at - 20 °C and 
was suitable for later use. The Chelex-100 method had a sensitivity of 99.5% and 
specificity of 78%. A Bland-Altman plot suggested that the Chelex-100 method was 
similar to the QIAamp DNA mini kit method for determining the feeding behaviours 
of vector mosquitoes. The Chelex-100 method is simple, cost-effective, and safe
and requires minimal time for DNA extraction from dried blood spots. In malaria
and dengue research, detecting the feeding behaviours from mosquito DNA from
dried blood spots on filter paper by PCR is an easy, minimally invasive and
inexpensive molecular technique that can be performed in remote areas.
