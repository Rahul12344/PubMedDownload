CD36 is a versatile receptor known to play a central role in the development of
atherosclerosis, the pathogenesis of malaria, and the removal of apoptotic cells.
Remarkably, the short cytosolically exposed regions of CD36 lack identifiable
motifs, which has hampered elucidation of its mode of signaling. Using a
combination of phosphoprotein isolation, mass spectrometry, superresolution
imaging, and gene silencing, we have determined that the receptor induces ligand 
internalization through a heteromeric complex consisting of CD36, β1 and/or β2
integrins, and the tetraspanins CD9 and/or CD81. This receptor complex serves to 
link CD36 to the adaptor FcRγ, which bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation 
motif. By coupling to FcRγ, CD36 is able to engage Src-family kinases and Syk,
which in turn drives the internalization of CD36 and its bound ligands.
