Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of malaria remain the hallmark for
reducing malaria-related mortality in high transmission areas. Plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein2 (PfHRP2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT)
play a vital role in prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis. However, pfhrp2 gene 
deletion threatens the RDT test sensitivity. This study reports the presence of
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes deletion among parasite isolates in Nigeria. Febrile
children were screened using histidine-rich protein (HRP2) specific RDT
(SD-Bioline RDT) and microscopy for P. falciparum infections. All RDT negative
samples were re-evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of
parasite in RDT false negative cases and randomly selected RDT positive cases
were validated using PCRs targeting glutamate-rich protein (glurp) and merozoite 
surface proteins (msp-1 and msp-2). Thereafter, exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 were 
amplified, and Sanger sequenced. A total of 511 febrile children were enrolled
out of which 309 (61%) were positive by RDT. The presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3
genes were analyzed in 66 PCR positive samples comprising of 31 RDT false
negative and 35 RDT true positive randomly selected samples. The pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes failed to amplify in 17% (11/66) and 6% (4/66) samples,
respectively. Seven of the eleven samples had only pfhrp2 deletion while four had
both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. The absence of the pfhrp2 gene may be
responsible for the seven RDT false negative cases observed. Three RDT positive
cases lacked pfhrp2 whereas pfhrp3 was absent in only four RDT false negative
cases. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 amino acid repeat sequences were highly diverse. The
P. falciparum isolates lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes may be circulating and
contributing to RDT false negativity in Nigeria. More studies in larger
population and seasonally defined cases will be needed to determine the extent of
pfhrp2/3 genes deletion in different geographical areas of Nigeria.
