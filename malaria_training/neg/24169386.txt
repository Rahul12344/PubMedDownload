OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity of a real time polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) for malaria diagnosis and to compare its accuracy with microscopy and an
antigen based rapid diagnostic test (OptiMal).
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Military Hospital, Armed Forces Institute of
Transfusion and Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from July to
December 2011.
METHODOLOGY: Venous blood samples of 300 clinically suspected patients of malaria
were tested for malaria parasite by microscopy and OptiMal; and malaria parasite 
index was calculated for the positive samples. Plasmodium genus specific real
time PCR was performed on all specimens, targeting small subunit rRNA gene.
Diagnostic accuracy of three tests was compared and cost analysis was done.
RESULTS: Out of 300 patients, malaria parasite was detected in 110, 106 and 123
patients by microscopy, OptiMAL and PCR respectively. Real time PCR was 100%
sensitive while microscopy and OptiMal had sensitivity of 89.4% and 86.2%
respectively. All methods were 100% specific. The cost per test was calculated to
be 0.2, 2.75 and 3.30 US$ by microscopy, OptiMal and PCR respectively, excluding 
the once capital cost on PCR equipment.
CONCLUSION: Genus specific real time PCR for the diagnosis of malaria was
successfully established as a highly sensitive and affordable technology that
should be incorporated in the diagnostic algorithm in this country.
