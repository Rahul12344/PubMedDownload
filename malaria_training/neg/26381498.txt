BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination drug is currently being
used in India for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum as partner drug in
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Resistance to sulfadoxine and
pyrimethamine in P. falciparum is linked with mutations in dihydropteroate
synthase (pfdhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) genes respectively. This
study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of such mutations in pfdhfr and
pfdhps genes in four states of India.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected from two states of India
with high malaria incidence i.e., Jharkhand and Odisha and two states with low
malaria incidence i.e., Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh between years 2006 to
2012. Part of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) drug resistance genes, pfdhfr and
pfdhps were PCR-amplified, sequenced and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 217 confirmed P. falciparum isolates were sequenced for both 
Pfdhfr and pfdhps gene. Two pfdhfr mutations 59R and 108N were most common
mutations prevalent in all localities in 77 % of isolates. Additionally, I164L
was found in Odisha and Jharkhand only (4/70 and 8/84, respectively). Another
mutation 51I was found in Odisha only (3/70). The pfdhps mutations 436A, 437G,
540E and 581G were found in Jharkhand and Odisha only in 13, 26, 14 and 13 %
isolates respectively, and was absent in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.
Combined together for pfdhps and pfdhfr locus, triple, quadruple, quintuple and
sextuple mutations were present in Jharkhand and Odisha while absent in Uttar
Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.
CONCLUSION: While only double mutants of pfdhfr was present in low transmission
area (Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh) with total absence of pfdhps mutants, up 
to sextuple mutations were present in high transmission areas (Odisha and
Jharkhand) for both the genes combined. Presence of multiple mutations in pfdhfr 
and pfdhps genes linked to SP resistance in high transmission area may lead to
fixation of multiple mutations in presence of high drug pressure and high
recombination rate.
