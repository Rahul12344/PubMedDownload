Studies of Plasmodium sporozoites and liver stages require dissection of
Anopheles mosquitoes to obtain sporozoites for experiments. Sporozoites from the 
rodent parasite P. yoelii are routinely used to infect hepatocytes for liver
stage culture, but sometimes these cultures become contaminated. Using standard
microbiological techniques, a single colony type of Gram-negative rod-shaped
bacteria was isolated from contaminated cultures. Mass spectrometry and
sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene identified the contaminant as 
Elizabethkingia spp. Based on sequence comparison and published studies of the
Anopheles microbiome, the best match was E. anophelis. Culture contamination was 
not ameliorated by density gradient purification of sporozoites. However, the
addition of vancomycin to the culture media consistently reduced contamination
and improved culture outcomes as measured by liver stage parasite size. Thus,
mosquito salivary gland-derived E. anophelis is identified a potential
contaminant of Plasmodium liver stage cultures that can be mitigated by the
addition of antibiotics.
