Sequence to activity mapping technologies are rapidly developing, enabling the
generation and isolation of mutations conferring novel phenotypes. Here we used
the CRISPR enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) technology to
investigate the inhibition of the essential ispC gene in its native genomic
context in Escherichia coli. We created a full saturation library of 33 sites
proximal to the ligand binding pocket and challenged this library with the
antimalarial drug fosmidomycin, which targets the ispC gene product, DXR. This
selection is especially challenging since it is relatively weak in E. coli, with 
multiple naturally occurring pathways for resistance. We identified several
previously unreported mutations that confer fosmidomycin resistance, in highly
conserved sites that also exist in pathogens including the malaria-inducing
Plasmodium falciparum. This approach may have implications for the isolation of
resistance-conferring mutations and may affect the design of future generations
of fosmidomycin-based drugs.
