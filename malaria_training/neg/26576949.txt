Infection by Toxoplasma gondii leads to massive changes to the host cell. Here,
we identify a novel host cell effector export pathway that requires the
Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5). We demonstrate that ASP5 cleaves a
highly constrained amino acid motif that has similarity to the PEXEL-motif of
Plasmodium parasites. We show that ASP5 matures substrates at both the N- and
C-terminal ends of proteins and also controls trafficking of effectors without
this motif. Furthermore, ASP5 controls establishment of the nanotubular network
and is required for the efficient recruitment of host mitochondria to the
vacuole. Assessment of host gene expression reveals that the ASP5-dependent
pathway influences thousands of the transcriptional changes that Toxoplasma
imparts on its host cell. All these changes result in attenuation of virulence of
Î”asp5 tachyzoites in vivo. This work characterizes the first identified machinery
required for export of Toxoplasma effectors into the infected host cell.
