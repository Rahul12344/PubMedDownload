BACKGROUND: Antimalarial drug resistance is a primary public health problem.
Haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1 gene have been implicated to be molecular markers 
of chloroquine (CQ) resistance. This study aims to explore mutation distribution 
of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG).
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from different districts of Bioko. The
single nucleotide polymorphisms in Pfcrt (codons 72 to 76) and Pfmdr1 (codons 86,
130, 184, 1034, 1042, 1109 and 1246) were assessed by nested PCR with DNA
sequencing and haplotype prevalences were also determined.
RESULTS: Analysis of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 mutations was successful in 151 and 157
samples respectively out of the 172 samples taken for this study. The mutations
of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 were found in 98.67% and 89.81% isolates, respectively. The
Pfcrt 74-76, Pfmdr1 86, and Pfmdr1 184 were 92.05%, 50.32%, and 87.26% found
mostly of mutation type, respectively. Three haplotypes coding 72-76 of Pfcrt
were found including CVMNK, CVIET, and CVM/I N/E K/T, which accounted for 1.33%, 
92.05%, and 6.62%, respectively. No mutation in Pfmdr1-N1 codon at 130 and
Pfmdr1-N2 (S1034C, N1042D, V1109I, and D1246Y) was detected. The types coding 86 
and 184 in Pfmdr1 were found including NY, YY, NF, YF, NY/F and YY/F, which
accounted for 10.19%, 2.55%, 33.76%, 45.22%, 5.73% and 2.55%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: High prevalence of Pfcrt CVIET and Pfmdr1 86Y, 184F double mutations 
confirm high-level CQ resistance (CQR) and might suggest reduced susceptibility
of Plasmodium falciparum isolates to AQ in Bioko, EG. It establishes fundamental 
data for detection of P. falciparum CQR with molecular markers and will promotes 
the surveillance level of drug resistance in Bioko, EG.
