We evaluated the dynamics of parasite populations during in vitro culture
adaptation in 15 mixed Plasmodium falciparum infections, which were collected
from a hypoendemic area near the China-Myanmar border. Allele types at the msp1
block 2 in the initial clinical samples and during subsequent culture were
quantified weekly using a quantitative PCR method. All mixed infections carried
two allele types based on the msp1 genotyping result. We also genotyped several
polymorphic sites in the dhfr, dhps and mdr1 genes on day 0 and day 28, which
showed that most of the common sites analyzed were monomorphic. Two of the three 
clinical samples mixed at dhps 581 remained stable while one changed to wild-type
during the culture. During in vitro culture, we observed a gradual loss of
parasite populations with 10 of the 15 mixed infections becoming monoclonal by
day 28 based on the msp1 allele type. In most cases, the more abundant msp1
allele types in the clinical blood samples at the beginning of culture became the
sole or predominant allele types on day 28. These results suggest that some
parasites may have growth advantages and the loss of parasite populations during 
culture adaptation of mixed infections may lead to biased results when comparing 
the phenotypes such as drug sensitivity of the culture-adapted parasites.
