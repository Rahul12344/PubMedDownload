Erythrocyte-binding antigens (EBAs) and P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding
homologue proteins (PfRhs) are two important protein families that can vary in
expression and utilization by P. falciparum to evade inhibitory antibodies. We
evaluated antibodies at repeated time-points among individuals living in an
endemic region in Nigeria over almost one year against these vaccine candidates. 
Antibody levels against EBA140, EBA175, EBA181, PfRh2, PfRh4, and MSP2, were
measured by ELISA. We also used parasites with disrupted EBA140, EBA175 and
EBA181 genes to show that all these were targets of invasion inhibitory
antibodies. However, antigenic targets of inhibitory antibodies were not stable
and changed substantially over time in most individuals, independent of age.
Antibodies levels measured by ELISA also varied within and between individuals
over time and the antibodies against EBA181, PfRh2 and MSP2 declined more rapidly
in younger individuals (â‰¤15 years) compared with older (>15). The breadth of high
antibody responses over time was more influenced by age than by the frequency of 
infection. High antibody levels were associated with a more stable invasion
inhibitory response, which could indicate that during the long process of
formation of immunity, many changes not only in levels but also in functional
responses are needed. This is an important finding in understanding natural
immunity against malaria, which is essential for making an efficacious vaccine.
