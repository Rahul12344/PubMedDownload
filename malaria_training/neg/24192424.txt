BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is a principal vector for Plasmodium vivax malaria
in most parts of China. Understanding of genetic structure and genetic
differentiation of the mosquito should contribute to the vector control and
malaria elimination in China.
METHODS: The present study investigated the genetic structure of An. sinensis
populations using a 729 bp fragment of mtDNA ND5 among 10 populations collected
from seven provinces in China.
RESULTS: ND5 was polymorphic by single mutations within three groups of An.
sinensis that were collected from 10 different geographic populations in China.
Out of 140 specimens collected from 10 representative sites, 84 haplotypes and 71
variable positions were determined. The overall level of genetic differentiation 
of An. sinensis varied from low to moderate across China and with a FST range of 
0.00065-0.341. Genealogy analysis clustered the populations of An. sinensis into 
three main clusters. Each cluster shared one main haplotype. Pairwise variations 
within populations were higher (68.68%) than among populations (31.32%) and with 
high fixation index (FST = 0.313). The results of the present study support
population growth and expansion in the An. sinensis populations from China. Three
clusters of An. sinensis populations were detected in this study with each
displaying different proportion patterns over seven Chinese provinces. No
correlation between genetic and geographic distance was detected in overall
populations of An. sinensis (R2 = 0.058; P = 0.301).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the ND5 gene of mtDNA is highly
polymorphic in An. sinensis and has moderate genetic variability in the
populations of this mosquito in China. Demographic and spatial results support
evidence of expansion in An. sinensis populations.
