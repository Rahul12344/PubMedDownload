BACKGROUND: Resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides is mainly attributed to
their adaptation to vector control interventions. Although pesticides used in
agriculture have been frequently mentioned as an additional force driving the
selection of resistance, only a few studies were dedicated to validate this
hypothesis and characterise the underlying mechanisms. While insecticide
resistance is rising dramatically in Africa, deciphering how agriculture affects 
resistance is crucial for improving resistance management strategies. In this
context, the multigenerational effect of agricultural pollutants on the selection
of insecticide resistance was examined in Anopheles gambiae.
METHODS: An urban Tanzanian An. gambiae population displaying a low resistance
level was used as a parental strain for a selection experiment across 20
generations. At each generation larvae were selected with a mixture containing
pesticides and herbicides classically used in agriculture in Africa. The
resistance levels of adults to deltamethrin, DDT and bendiocarb were compared
between the selected and non-selected strains across the selection process
together with the frequency of kdr mutations. A microarray approach was used for 
pinpointing transcription level variations selected by the agricultural pesticide
mixture at the adult stage.
RESULTS: A gradual increase of adult resistance to all insecticides was observed 
across the selection process. The frequency of the L1014S kdr mutation rose from 
1.6% to 12.5% after 20 generations of selection. Microarray analysis identified
90 transcripts over-transcribed in the selected strain as compared to the
parental and the non-selected strains. Genes encoding cuticle proteins,
detoxification enzymes, proteins linked to neurotransmitter activity and
transcription regulators were mainly affected. RT-qPCR transcription profiling of
candidate genes across multiple generations supported their link with insecticide
resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the potency of agriculture in selecting for
insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. We demonstrated that the recurrent
exposure of larvae to agricultural pollutants can select for resistance
mechanisms to vector control insecticides at the adult stage. Our data suggest
that in addition to selected target-site resistance mutations, agricultural
pollutants may also favor cuticle, metabolic and synaptic transmission-based
resistance mechanisms. These results emphasize the need for integrated resistance
management strategies taking into account agriculture activities.
