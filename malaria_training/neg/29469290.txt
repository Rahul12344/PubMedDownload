OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Wondfo Rapid Diagnostic Kit (Pf-LDH/Pan -pLDH) for
detecting Plasmodium ovale and analyze the influence of parasitaemia,
concentration and polymorphism of pLDH on the performances.
METHODS: A total of 100 blood samples from P. ovale patients confirmed by PCR
were detected with the Wondfo Rapid Diagnostic Kit according to the
manufacturers'instructions. The parasitaemia was determined by the microscopic
examination. The concentration of pLDH was measured by ELISA tests. The LDH gene 
of P. ovale was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The influence of these three
factors on the positive rate was analyzed.
RESULTS: The overall positive rate of Wondfo Rapid Diagnostic Kit was 70.0%
(70/100). The positive rate was 27.3% for the samples with parasitaemia ≤ 500
parasites/μl and reached 75.0%-75.4% when parasitaemia > 500 parasites/μl. The
positive rate was 6.7% for samples with a low pLDH concentration (A values ≤
0.100) and reached 95.1%-100% at a high pLDH concentration (A values > 0.100).
The results of sequence analysis indicated that all the samples could be divided 
into 2 types, P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri. The gene homology of LDH between
2 types was 97%. There were 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (s) (SNPs) between 
2 types, while only 3 SNPs were non-synonymous mutations. The homology of LDH
amino acid sequences between 2 types was 99%; only 3 amino acids were different. 
The positive rates for P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri were 73.1% (38/52) and
66.7% (32/48) respectively; there was no statistically significant difference (P 
> 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The Wondfo Rapid Diagnostic Kit (Pf-LDH/Pan-pLDH) performs better
than most of the similar products for the detection of P. ovale, and the positive
rates are closely related to the parasitaemia and concentration of pLDH, while no
related to the polymorphism of pLDH gene.

Publisher: ［摘要］ 目的 评价万孚疟原虫检测试剂盒 (Pf-LDH/Pan-pLDH)对卵形疟原虫的检测效果, 并分析原虫密度、疟原虫乳 酸脱氢酶
(pLDH)浓度和基因多态性等因素对检测结果的影响。 方法 按照万孚疟原虫检测试剂盒的操作说明书, 对经 PCR确认的100份卵形疟患者血样进行检测。
采用显微镜镜检法计数患者血片的原虫密度, 以ELISA法检测血样中的 pLDH浓度, 以PCR扩增卵形疟原虫LDH (Po-LDH)基因并测序,
并分析上述3个因素对检出率的影响。 结果 万孚疟原 虫检测试剂盒对上述100份卵形疟患者血样的总体检出率为70.0% (70/100)。 当原虫密度≤
500个/μl时, 检出率为 27.3%; 原虫密度> 500个/μl时, 检出率为75.0%～75.4%。 当pLDH浓度较低时 (A 值≤ 0.100),
检出率为6.7%; pLDH达 到一定浓度时 (A 值 > 0.100), 检出率为95.1%～100%。
Po-LDH基因序列分析结果显示所有卵形疟样本可分为2种亚 型, 分别为卵形疟原虫curtisi 亚种 (P. o.
curtisi)和卵形疟原虫wallikeri 亚种 (P. o. wallikeri)。 2种亚型的LDH基因同源 性为97%, 共有24个单核苷酸多态性
(SNP), 其中3个SNPs为非同义突变, 其余均为同义突变。 2种亚型的LDH编码氨 基酸序列同源性为99%, 共有3个氨基酸的差异。
万孚疟原虫检测试剂盒对P. o. curtisi 的检出率为73.1% (38/52), 对 P. o. wallikeri的检出率为66.7% (32/48),
两者差异无统计学意义 (P > 0.05)。 结论 万孚疟原虫检测试剂盒对卵形疟原虫的 检测效果优于大部分同类产品, 其检出率与原虫密度、pLDH浓度关系密切, 
与pLDH基因多态性无关。.
