OBJECTIVE: Vorinostat is a drug used to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma whose
action mechanism is based on Histone Deacetylase inhibition. Histone Deacetylases
are a family of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone and non-histone
proteins that control many crucial processes, such as gene regulation, cell cycle
progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Histone Deacetylase homologues are
also expressed in parasites of the genus Plasmodium, Leishmania, Cryptosporidium,
Schistosoma, Entamoeba, and others. In this way, antiparasitic properties of
Vorinostat have been explored. The aim of this review is to report the current
state knowledge of Vorinostat as antiparasitic drug against Plasmodium,
Leishmania, Cryptosporidium, Schistosoma and Entamoeba in order to support future
investigation in this field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors revised the recent and relevant literature
concerning the topic and discussed advances and limitations of studies on
Vorinostat as potential drug to treat human parasitic diseases.
RESULTS: Vorinostat has been efficient in vitro and, in some cases, in vivo,
against parasites that cause parasitic diseases, such as malaria, leishmaniasis, 
cryptosporidiosis, amoebiasis, and schistosomiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: In vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated the antiparasitic
activity of Vorinostat, however, the challenge is to assay its activity in animal
models and to evaluate if Vorinostat is safe for humans as new alternative to
treat human parasitic infections.
