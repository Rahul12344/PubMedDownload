BACKGROUND: The return of chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum to the
limited area of Blantyre, Malawi, has been well demonstrated in several studies.
METHODS: To characterize chloroquine susceptibility over a wide geographic area, 
infants and children aged 6-59 months were selected using 2-stage cluster
sampling in 8 Malawian districts. Pyrosequencing of the pfcrt gene codon 76
region was performed for children with asexual parasitemia.
RESULTS: Of 7145 children, 1150 had microscopic asexual parasitemia, and
sequencing was performed in 685, of whom 1 had a chloroquine-resistant genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic countrywide sampling demonstrates that the chloroquine
pfcrt genotype has reached near-fixation, raising the possibility of
reintroducing chloroquine for malaria prevention and treatment.
