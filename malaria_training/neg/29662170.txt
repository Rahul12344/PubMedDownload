The transcription factor c-Maf induces the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in
CD4+ T cells in vitro. However, the global effects of c-Maf on diverse immune
responses in vivo are unknown. Here we found that c-Maf regulated IL-10
production in CD4+ T cells in disease models involving the TH1 subset of helper T
cells (malaria), TH2 cells (allergy) and TH17 cells (autoimmunity) in vivo.
Although mice with c-Maf deficiency targeted to T cells showed greater pathology 
in TH1 and TH2 responses, TH17 cell-mediated pathology was reduced in this
context, with an accompanying decrease in TH17 cells and increase in Foxp3+
regulatory T cells. Bivariate genomic footprinting elucidated the c-Maf
transcription-factor network, including enhanced activity of NFAT; this led to
the identification and validation of c-Maf as a negative regulator of IL-2. The
decreased expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor RORγt (Rorc)
that resulted from c-Maf deficiency was dependent on IL-2, which explained the in
vivo observations. Thus, c-Maf is a positive and negative regulator of the
expression of cytokine-encoding genes, with context-specific effects that allow
each immune response to occur in a controlled yet effective manner.
