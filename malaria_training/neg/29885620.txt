BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has been known for decades in Africa but
contemporary data is lacking at large.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the seroepidemiology of ZIKV in North Central Nigeria.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study at six health care facilities 
in North Central Nigeria from January to December 2016. Detection of ZIKV
antibodies was done using an anti-ZIKV recombinant non-structural protein 1
(NS1)-based ELISA. A colorimetric assay to detect ZIKV neutralizing antibodies
was used on ELISA reactive and randomly selected ELISA non-reactive samples. ZIKV
real-time RT-PCR was done on a subset of samples.
RESULTS: A total of 468 individual samples were included with almost 60% from
pregnant women. Using NS1-based ELISA, an anti-ZIKV positive rate of 6% for IgM
and 4% for IgG was found. Pregnant women showed anti-ZIKV positive rates of 4%
for IgM and 3% for IgG. None of the ZIKV antibody positive samples tested ZIKV
RT-PCR positive. An association with male sex was found for anti-ZIKV IgG ELISA
positivity (prevalence ratio 3.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-8.25; p = .004).
No association with pregnancy, yellow fever vaccination or malaria was found for 
anti-ZIKV IgM or IgG positivity. ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were detected in
17/18 (94%) anti-ZIKV NS1 positive/borderline samples and in one sample without
detectable ZIKV NS1 antibodies. Partial ZIKV E gene sequence was retrieved in one
sample without ZIKV antibodies, which clustered within the West African ZIKV
lineage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a largely ZIKV immunologically naïve population and
reinforce the importance of ZIKV surveillance in Africa.
