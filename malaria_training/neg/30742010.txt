Although it is known that malaria parasites proliferate in the midgut of mosquito
vector, their detailed behaviors, from gamete maturation to formation of next
generation sporozoite, have not been fully understood at cellular or molecular
level. This is mainly attributed to technical difficulties of dissection and
whole-mount observation, of delicate and opaque mosquito body contents. In
addition, blood pigment surrounding parasites immediately after blood meal also
complicates tracing mosquito-stage parasites. Recent revolutionary studies have
overcome such negative factors in tissue observation by clearing organisms. CUBIC
reagents succeeded to remove both light scattering and blood pigment from various
mouse tissues, and to whole-organ image fluorescence-labeled cell structures. In 
this study, we utilized the advanced version of CUBIC technology and high
sensitivity fluorescent markers for see-through observation of mosquito vector
after engulfment of rodent malaria parasites to clarify their behaviors during
mosquito stage. As a result, we succeeded to visualize oocysts, sporozoites,
female gametes and ookinetes in the mosquito bodies without any dissection.
