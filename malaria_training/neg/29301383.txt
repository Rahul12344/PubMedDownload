Artemisinin is a natural sesquiterpene lactone obtained from the Artemisia annua 
herb. It is widely used for the treatment of malaria. In this article, we have
reviewed the role of artemisinin in controlling malaria, spread of resistance to 
artemisinin and the different methods used for its large scale production. The
highest amount of artemisinin gene expression in tobacco leaf chloroplast leads
to the production of 0.8 mg/g of the dry weight of the plant. This will
revolutionize the treatment and control of malaria in third world countries.
Furthermore, the generations of novel derivatives of artemisinin- and trioxane
ring structure-inspired compounds are important for the treatment of malaria
caused by resistant plasmodial species. Synthetic endoperoxide-like artefenomel
and its derivatives are crucial for the control of malaria and such synthetic
compounds should be further explored.
