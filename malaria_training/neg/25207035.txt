OBJECTIVE: In this study, kinetic analysis was performed to understand the
functional importance of the amino terminal of the active site of previously
mutated Plasmodium vivax Lactate Dehydrogenase enzyme by mimicking Toxoplasma
gondii I, II, Eimeria acervulina and Eimeria tenella LDH's.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mutant LDH genes were amplified by PCR and 6xHistag was
added to the C-terminal of the enzymes. Then LDH enzymes are overproduced as
recombinant in E. coli cells, purified by Ni-NTA agarose matrix and kinetic
properties were analysed.
RESULTS: Observing increase of Km values of mutant enzymes showed that mutations 
in this place caused decreasing affinity of enzyme for its substrate. However
kcat values were about the same throughout all mutant proteins.
CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of the studied region emphasizes the significance of this
site for drug design studies for both Plasmodium and some other Apicomplexans.
