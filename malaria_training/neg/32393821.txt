Only female insects transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue and Zika;
therefore, control methods that bias the sex ratio of insect offspring have long 
been sought. Genetic elements such as sex-chromosome drives can distort sex
ratios to produce unisex populations that eventually collapse, but the underlying
molecular mechanisms are unknown. We report a male-biased sex-distorter gene
drive (SDGD) in the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We induced
super-Mendelian inheritance of the X-chromosome-shredding I-PpoI nuclease by
coupling this to a CRISPR-based gene drive inserted into a conserved sequence of 
the doublesex (dsx) gene. In modeling of invasion dynamics, SDGD was predicted to
have a quicker impact on female mosquito populations than previously developed
gene drives targeting female fertility. The SDGD at the dsx locus led to a
male-only population from a 2.5% starting allelic frequency in 10-14 generations,
with population collapse and no selection for resistance. Our results support the
use of SDGD for malaria vector control.
