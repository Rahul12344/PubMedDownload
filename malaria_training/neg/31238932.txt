BACKGROUND: Reverse genetics approaches have become powerful tools to dissect the
biology of malaria parasites. In a previous study, development of an in vitro
drug selection method for generating transgenic parasite of Plasmodium berghei
was reported. Using this method, two novel and independent selection markers
using the P. berghei heat shock protein 70 promoter was previously established.
While the approach permits the easy and flexible genetic manipulation of P.
berghei, shortcomings include a low variety in promoter options to drive marker
gene expression and increased complexity of the selection procedure. In this
study, addressing these issues was attempted.
METHODS: To secure a variety of promoters, the use of a P. berghei elongation
factor-1α promoter for marker gene expression was attempted. To simplify the
procedure of in vitro selection, the establishment of a two cell-cycle culture
method and its application for drug selection were attempted.
RESULTS: The P. berghei elongation factor-1α (pbef-1α) promoter, which is
commonly used to drive marker gene expression, was successfully applied as an
alternative promoter model for marker gene expression, using the parasite's
codon-optimized marker sequence. To simplify the in vitro selection method, a two
cell-cycle culture method in which the merozoite was released by filtration of
the culture containing matured schizont-infected erythrocytes was also developed 
and successfully applied for drug selection.
CONCLUSION: The pbef-1α promoter was successfully applied in an in vitro
selection system. The in vitro selection procedure also could be simplified for
practical use using a two cell-cycle culture method. These improvements provide a
more versatile platform for the genetic manipulation of P. berghei.
