Malaria is an infectious disease that threatens half of the world's population.
This debilitating disease is caused by infection from parasites of the genus
Plasmodium. Insecticides, bed nets and drug therapies have lowered the prevalence
and death rate associated with malaria but this disease continues to plague many 
populations around the world. In recent years, many organizations have suggested 
developing methods for a complete eradication of malaria. The most
straightforward and effective method for this potential eradication will be
through the development of a low-cost vaccine. To achieve eradication, it will be
necessary to develop new vaccine candidates and novel systems for both the
production and delivery of these vaccines. Recently, the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used for the recombinant expression of malaria
vaccine candidates including the transmission blocking vaccine candidate
Pfs48/45. Here, we discuss the potential of this research on the future
development of a low-cost malaria vaccine candidate.
