Malaria parasites have evolved a complicated life cycle alternating between two
hosts. Gametocytes are produced in the vertebrate hosts and are obligatory for
natural transmission of the parasites through mosquito vectors. The mechanism of 
sexual development in Plasmodium has been the focus of extensive studies. In the 
postgenomic era, the advent of genome-wide analytical tools and genetic
manipulation technology has enabled rapid advancement of our knowledge in this
area. Patterns of gene expression during sexual development, molecular
distinction of the two sexes, and mechanisms underlying subsequent formation of
gametes and their fertilization have been progressively elucidated. However, the 
triggers and mechanism of sexual development remain largely unknown. This article
provides an update of our understanding of the molecular and cellular events
associated with the decision for commitment to sexual development and regulation 
of gene expression during gametocytogenesis. Insights into the molecular
mechanisms of gametocyte development are essential for designing proper control
strategies for interruption of malaria transmission and ultimate elimination.
