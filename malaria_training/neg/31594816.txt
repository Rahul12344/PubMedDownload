Understanding the mechanisms behind host cell invasion by Plasmodium falciparum
remains a major hurdle to developing antimalarial therapeutics that target the
asexual cycle and the symptomatic stage of malaria. Host cell entry is enabled by
a multitude of precisely timed and tightly regulated receptor-ligand
interactions. Cyclic nucleotide signaling has been implicated in regulating
parasite invasion, and an important downstream effector of the cAMP-signaling
pathway is protein kinase A (PKA), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. There is
increasing evidence that P. falciparum PKA (PfPKA) is responsible for
phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of P. falciparum apical membrane
antigen 1 (PfAMA1) at Ser610, a cAMP-dependent event that is crucial for
successful parasite invasion. In the present study, CRISPR-Cas9 and conditional
gene deletion (dimerizable cre) technologies were implemented to generate a P.
falciparum parasite line in which expression of the catalytic subunit of PfPKA
(PfPKAc) is under conditional control, demonstrating highly efficient dimerizable
Cre recombinase (DiCre)-mediated gene excision and complete knockdown of protein 
expression. Parasites lacking PfPKAc show severely reduced growth after one
intraerythrocytic growth cycle and are deficient in host cell invasion, as
highlighted by live-imaging experiments. Furthermore, PfPKAc-deficient parasites 
are unable to phosphorylate PfAMA1 at Ser610. This work not only identifies an
essential role for PfPKAc in the P. falciparum asexual life cycle but also
confirms that PfPKAc is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating PfAMA1
Ser610.IMPORTANCE Malaria continues to present a major global health burden,
particularly in low-resource countries. Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite
responsible for the most severe form of malaria, causes disease through rapid and
repeated rounds of invasion and replication within red blood cells. Invasion into
red blood cells is essential for P. falciparum survival, and the molecular events
mediating this process have gained much attention as potential therapeutic
targets. With no effective vaccine available, and with the emergence of
resistance to antimalarials, there is an urgent need for the development of new
therapeutics. Our research has used genetic techniques to provide evidence of an 
essential protein kinase involved in P. falciparum invasion. Our work adds to the
current understanding of parasite signaling processes required for invasion,
highlighting PKA as a potential drug target to inhibit invasion for the treatment
of malaria.
