BACKGROUND: Gene copy number variants (CNVs), which consist of deletions and
amplifications of single or sets of contiguous genes, contribute to the great
diversity in the Plasmodium falciparum genome. In vitro studies in the laboratory
have revealed their important role in parasite fitness phenotypes such as red
cell invasion, transmissibility and cytoadherence. Studies of natural parasite
populations indicate that CNVs are also common in the field and thus may
facilitate adaptation of the parasite to its local environment.
RESULTS: In a survey of 183 fresh field isolates from three populations in
Eastern Africa with different malaria transmission intensities, we identified 94 
CNV loci using microarrays. All CNVs had low population frequencies (minor allele
frequency < 5%) but each parasite isolate carried an average of 8 CNVs. Nine CNVs
showed high levels of population differentiation (FST > 0.3) and nine exhibited
significant clines in population frequency across a gradient in transmission
intensity. The clearest example of this was a large deletion on chromosome 9
previously reported only in laboratory-adapted isolates. This deletion was
present in 33% of isolates from a population with low and highly seasonal malaria
transmission, and in < 9% of isolates from populations with higher transmission. 
Subsets of CNVs were strongly correlated in their population frequencies,
implying co-selection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that CNVs are the target of
selection in natural populations of P. falciparum. Their environment-specific
patterns observed here imply an important role for them in conferring
adaptability to the parasite thus enabling it to persist in its highly diverse
ecological environment.
