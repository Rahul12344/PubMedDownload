BACKGROUND: Baculovirus vector (BV) is able to transduce foreign genes into
mammalian cells efficiently and safely by incorporating a mammalian promoter. In 
the present study, we tailored the surface proteins expressed by malaria
sporozoites to enhance hepatocyte transduction. Sporozoites infect hepatocytes
within minutes of initial entry into the blood circulation. Infectivity and
hepatocyte-specific selectivity are mediated by the interplay between hepatocytes
and sporozoite surface proteins. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) bind to the heparan sulfate
proteoglycan on the hepatocyte surface and contribute to sporozoite infection and
hepatocyte selectivity.
METHODS: BVs displaying an ectodomain consisting of three different CSP variants 
(full-length, N-terminal and C-terminal) or TRAP on the virus envelope were
constructed, and the resulting in vitro hepatocyte transduction efficiency was
evaluated.
RESULTS: We demonstrated improved hepatocyte transduction efficiency in BVs
expressing CSP or TRAP ectodomains compared to BVs without malaria surface
proteins. In addition, gene transduction efficiencies for BVs displaying CSP or
TRAP are higher than those expressing the preS1 antigen of the hepatitis B virus.
CONCLUSIONS: BVs expressing CSP or TRAP in the ectodomain could represent a
promising hepatocyte-specific gene delivery methodology. Copyright © 2016 John
