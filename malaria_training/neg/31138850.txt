Liver stage Plasmodium parasites reside in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that
associates with lysosomes. It has previously been shown that these organelles can
have beneficial as well as harmful effects on the parasite. Yet it is not clear
how the association of lysosomes with the parasite is controlled and how
interactions with these organelles lead to the antagonistic outcomes. In this
study we used advanced imaging techniques to characterize lysosomal interactions 
with the PV. In host cells harboring successfully developing parasites we
observed that these interaction events reach an equilibrium at the PV membrane
(PVM). In a population of arrested parasites, this equilibrium appeared to shift 
towards a strongly increased lysosomal fusion with the PVM witnessed by strong
PVM labeling with the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1. This was followed by
acidification of the PV and elimination of the parasite. To systematically
investigate elimination of arrested parasites, we generated transgenic parasites 
that express the photosensitizer KillerRed, which leads to parasite killing after
activation. Our work provides insights in cellular details of intracellular
killing and lysosomal elimination of Plasmodium parasites independent of cells of
the immune system.
