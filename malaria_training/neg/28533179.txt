BACKGROUND: In India, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is now in use as a partner 
drug of ACT (AS+SP) to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2010.
Declined trend of AS+SP efficacy has been reported from north-eastern states of
the country. It is not possible to determine the efficacy of SP alone from any
study with ACT. So, this work was designed to study the pattern of polymorphisms 
in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes to predict the SP resistance status among parasite
population of urban Kolkata after five years of ACT implementation.
METHODS: A total of 125 P. falciparum positive patients were enrolled in the
study during December 2014 to July 2016 and treated with AS+SP. Parasitic DNA was
isolated and subjected to sequencing of pfdhfr and pfdhps genes directly from
purified PCR products.
RESULTS: Genotyping of both the genes was successfully done in 113 isolates. In
pfdhfr, 94.69% (107/113) isolates showed mutations at codon 59 and 108. A double 
mutant genotype ANRNI was mostly prevalent (107/113, 94.69%), while wild-type
genotype ANCSI was found only in 5.3% (6/113) isolates. In pfdhps, mutations were
recorded at codon 436 and 437 in 65.49% (74/113) and 23.01% (26/113) isolates,
respectively. In combined pfdhfr-pfdhps genes, triple mutant ANRNI-FAKAA was most
prevalent (45/113, 39.82%) followed by double mutant ANRNI-SAKAA (37/113, 32.74%)
and quadruple mutant ANRNI-FGKAA (24/113, 21.24%).
CONCLUSION: SP resistance hallmark mutations i.e., quadruple (AIRNI-SAEAA) or
quintuple (AIRNI-SGEAA) genotype in pfdhfr and pfdhps was absent which indicates 
that SP components of used ACT is still effective in the study area. It is also
evident by the clinical response of AS+SP. Monitoring the efficacy of this
combination (both by therapeutic and molecular marker study) at a regular
interval is highly suggested to record any development of SP resistance in near
future.
