Sickle cell disease, one of the world's most common genetic disorders is
prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The trans-Atlantic slave trade accounted for the
gene movement from Africa to the Caribbean and United States of America and
lately, migration has resulted in the introduction of the gene to the United
Kingdom and other parts of Europe. Different haplotypes exist, however the
differences in these haplotypes are not sufficient to explain the different
clinical variations within the same region or different settings.
