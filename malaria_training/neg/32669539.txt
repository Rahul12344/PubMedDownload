Asexual proliferation of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria follows a
developmental program that alternates non-canonical intraerythrocytic replication
with dissemination to new host cells. We carried out a functional analysis of the
Plasmodium falciparum homolog of Protein Phosphatase 1 (PfPP1), a universally
conserved cell cycle factor in eukaryotes, to investigate regulation of parasite 
proliferation. PfPP1 is indeed required for efficient replication, but is
absolutely essential for egress of parasites from host red blood cells. By
phosphoproteomic and chemical-genetic analysis, we isolate two functional targets
of PfPP1 for egress: a HECT E3 protein-ubiquitin ligase; and GCα, a fusion
protein composed of a guanylyl cyclase and a phospholipid transporter domain. We 
hypothesize that PfPP1 regulates lipid sensing by GCα and find that
phosphatidylcholine stimulates PfPP1-dependent egress. PfPP1 acts as a key
regulator that integrates multiple cell-intrinsic pathways with external signals 
to direct parasite egress from host cells.
