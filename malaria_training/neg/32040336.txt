CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for the design of gene-drive systems to
control and/or modify mosquito vector populations; however, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
nonhomologous end joining mutations can have an important impact on generating
alleles resistant to the drive and thus on drive efficiency. We demonstrate and
compare the insertions or deletions (indels) detection capabilities of two
techniques in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi: Indel Detection by
Amplicon Analysis (IDAA™) and Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR™). Both techniques
showed accuracy and reproducibility for indel frequencies across mosquito samples
containing different ratios of indels of various sizes. Moreover, these
techniques have advantages that make them potentially better suited for
high-throughput nonhomologous end joining analysis in cage trials and contained
field testing of gene-drive mosquitoes.
