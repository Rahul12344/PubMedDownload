Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication with brain vascular
hyperpermeability. Claudin-5 is the major component of tight junctions. To
investigate the expression of claudin-5 in CM, we established a murine
experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model and an in vitro model by treating
murine brain endothelial cells (bEnd3) with plasma from ECM mice. Expression of
claudin-5 and the ETS transcription factor Erg was reduced in the brain
endothelium of ECM mice. In bEnd3 cells exposed to ECM plasma, decreased
expression of claudin-5 and Erg, and increased permeability were observed.
Silencing of Erg significantly reduced Cldn5 expression. ChIP assays indicated
that Erg binds to the -813 ETS motif of the murine Cldn5 gene promoter, and the
binding is decreased by treatment with ECM plasma.
