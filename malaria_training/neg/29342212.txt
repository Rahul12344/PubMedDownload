Parasite virulence, an important factor contributing to the severity of
Plasmodium falciparum infection, varies among P. falciparum strains. Relatively
little is known regarding markers of virulence capable of identifying strains
responsible for severe malaria. We investigated the effects of genetic variations
in the P.f. merozoite surface protein 2 gene (msp2) on virulence, as it was
previously postulated as a factor. We analyzed 300 msp2 sequences of single P.
falciparum clone infection from patients with uncomplicated disease as well as
those admitted for severe malaria with and without cerebral disease. The
association of msp2 variations with disease severity was examined. We found that 
the N allele at codon 8 of Block 2 in the FC27-like msp2 gene was significantly
associated with severe disease without cerebral complications (odds ratio = 2.73,
P = 0.039), while the K allele at codon 17 of Block 4 in the 3D7-like msp2 gene
was associated with cerebral malaria (odds ratio = 3.52, P = 0.024). The data
suggests possible roles for the associated alleles on parasite invasion processes
and immune-mediated pathogenicity. Multiplicity of infection was found to
associate with severe disease without cerebral complications, but not cerebral
malaria. Variations in the msp2-FC27-block 2-8N and 3D7-block 4-17K allele appear
to be parasite virulence markers, and may be useful in determining the likelihood
for severe and cerebral malaria. Their interactions with potential host factors
for severe diseases should also be explored.
