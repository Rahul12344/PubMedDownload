BACKGROUND: During development in human erythrocytes, Plasmodium falciparum
parasites display a remarkable number of adhesive proteins on their plasma
membrane. In the invasive merozoites, these include members of the PfMSP1 and
PfAMA1/RON complexes, which facilitate contact between merozoites and red blood
cells. In gametocytes, sexual precursor cells mediating parasite transmission to 
the mosquito vector, plasma membrane-associated proteins primarily belong to the 
PfCCp and 6-cys families with roles in fertilization. This study describes a
newly identified WD40-repeat protein unique to Plasmodium species that associates
with adhesion protein complexes of both merozoites and gametocytes.
METHODS: The WD40-repeat protein-like protein PfWLP1 was identified via
co-immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry and characterized
using biochemical and immunohistochemistry methods. Reverse genetics were
employed for functional analysis.
RESULTS: PfWLP1 is expressed both in schizonts and gametocytes. In mature
schizonts, the protein localizes underneath the merozoite micronemes and
interacts with PfAMA1, while in gametocytes PfWLP1 primarily accumulates
underneath the plasma membrane and associates with PfCCp1 and Pfs230. Reverse
genetics failed to disrupt the pfwlp1 gene, while haemagglutinin-tagging was
feasible, suggesting a crucial function for PfWLP1 during blood stage
replication.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on a plasmodial WD40-repeat protein
associating with cell adhesion proteins. Since WD40 domains are known to mediate 
protein-protein contact by serving as a rigid scaffold for protein interactions, 
the presented data suggest that PfWLP1 supports the stability of adhesion protein
complexes of the plasmodial blood stages.
