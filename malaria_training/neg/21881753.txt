Enhanced understanding of the transmission dynamics and population genetics for
Plasmodium vivax is crucial in predicting the emergence and spread of novel
parasite phenotypes with major public health implications, such as new relapsing 
patterns, drug resistance and increased virulence. Suitable molecular markers are
required for these population genetic studies. Here, we focus on two groups of
molecular markers that are commonly used to analyse natural populations of P.
vivax. We use markers under selective pressure, for instance, antigen-coding
polymorphic genes, and markers that are not under strong natural selection, such 
as most minisatellite and microsatellite loci. First, we review data obtained
using genes encoding for P. vivax antigens: circumsporozoite protein, merozoite
surface proteins 1 and 3α, apical membrane antigen 1 and Duffy binding antigen.
We next address neutral or nearly neutral molecular markers, especially
microsatellite loci, providing a complete list of markers that have already been 
used in P. vivax populations studies. We also analyse the microsatellite loci
identified in the P. vivax genome project. Finally, we discuss some practical
uses for P. vivax genotyping, for example, detecting multiple-clone infections
and tracking the geographic origin of isolates.
