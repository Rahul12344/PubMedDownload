BACKGROUND: Plasmodium malariae is a widely spread but neglected human malaria
parasite, which causes chronic infections. Studies on genetic polymorphisms of
anti-malarial drug target genes in P. malariae are limited. Previous reports have
shown polymorphisms in the P. malariae dihydrofolate reductase gene associated
with pyrimethamine resistance and linked to pyrimethamine drug pressure. This
study investigated polymorphisms of the P. malariae homologous genes, chloroquine
resistant transporter and multidrug resistant 1, associated with chloroquine and 
mefloquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.
METHODS: The orthologous P. malariae crt and mdr1 genes were studied in 95
patients with P. malariae infection between 2002 and 2016 from Thailand (N = 51) 
and Myanmar (N = 44). Gene sequences were analysed using BioEdit, MEGA7, and
DnaSP programs. Mutations and gene amplifications were compared with P.
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax orthologous genes. Protein topology models
derived from the observed pmcrt and pmmdr1 haplotypes were constructed and
analysed using Phyre2, SWISS MODEL and Discovery Studio Visualization V 17.2.
RESULTS: Two non-synonymous mutations were observed in exon 2 (H53P, 40%) and
exon 8 (E278D, 44%) of pmcrt. The topology model indicated that H53P and E278D
were located outside of the transmembrane domain and were unlikely to affect
protein function. Pmmdr1 was more diverse than pmcrt, with 10 non-synonymous and 
3 synonymous mutations observed. Non-synonymous mutations were located in the
parasite cytoplasmic site, transmembrane 11 and nucleotide binding domains 1 and 
2. Polymorphisms conferring amino acid changes in the transmembrane and
nucleotide binding domains were predicted to have some effect on PmMDR1
conformation, but were unlikely to affect protein function. All P. malariae
parasites in this study contained a single copy of the mdr1 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed polymorphisms in pmcrt and pmmdr1 genes are unlikely to
affect protein function and unlikely related to chloroquine drug pressure.
Similarly, the absence of pmmdr1 copy number variation suggests limited
mefloquine drug pressure on the P. malariae parasite population, despite its long
time use in Thailand for the treatment of falciparum malaria.
