BACKGROUND: The current trend of Plasmodium vivax cases imported from Southeast
Asia into China has sharply increased recently, especially from the China-Myanmar
border (CMB) area. High recombination rates of P. vivax populations associated
with varied transmission intensity might cause distinct local selective
pressures. The information on the genetic variability of P. vivax in this area is
scant. Hence, this study assessed the genetic diversity of P. vivax genome
sequence in CMB area and aimed to provide information on the positive selection
of new gene loci.
RESULTS: This study reports a genome-wide survey of P. vivax in CMB area, using
blood samples from local patients to identify population-specific selective
processes. The result showed that considerable genetic diversity and mean
pair-wise divergence among the sequenced P. vivax isolates were higher in some
important gene families. Using the standardized integrated haplotype score
(|iHS|) for all SNPs in chromosomal regions with SNPs above the top 1%
distribution, it was observed that the top score locus involved 356 genes and
most of them are associated with red blood cell invasion and immune evasion. The 
XP-EHH test was also applied and some important genes associated with
anti-malarial drug resistance were observed in high positive scores list. This
result suggests that P. vivax in CMB area is facing more pressure to survive than
any other region and this has led to the strong positive selection of genes that 
are associated with host-parasite interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that greater genetic diversity in P. vivax from 
CMB area and positive selection signals in invasion and drug resistance genes are
consistent with the history of drug use during malaria elimination programme in
CMB area. Furthermore, this result also demonstrates that haplotype-based
detecting selection can assist the genome-wide methods to identify the
determinants of P. vivax diversity.
