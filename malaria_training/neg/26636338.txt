Novel interventions are needed to prevent the transmission of the Plasmodium
parasites that cause malaria. One possible method is to supply mosquitoes with
antiplasmodial effector proteins from bacteria by paratransgenesis. Mosquitoes
have a diverse complement of midgut microbiota including the Gram-negative
bacteria Asaia bogorensis. This study presents the first use of Asaia sp.
bacteria for paratransgenesis against P. berghei. We identified putative secreted
proteins from A. bogorensis by a genetic screen using alkaline phosphatase gene
fusions. Two were secreted efficiently: a siderophore receptor protein and a YVTN
beta-propeller repeat protein. The siderophore receptor gene was fused with
antiplasmodial effector genes including the scorpine antimicrobial peptide and an
anti-Pbs21 scFv-Shiva1 immunotoxin. Asaia SF2.1 secreting these fusion proteins
were fed to mosquitoes and challenged with Plasmodium berghei-infected blood.
With each of these effector constructs, significant inhibition of parasite
development was observed. These results provide a novel and promising
intervention against malaria transmission.
