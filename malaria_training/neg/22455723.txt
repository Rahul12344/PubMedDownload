Assessing vector-parasite relationship is important in understanding the
emergence of vector-borne diseases and the evolution of parasite diversity. This 
study investigates avian Plasmodium parasites in mosquitoes collected from
Kayseri province in Central Anatolian, Turkey and determines the haemosporidian
parasite lineages from these mosquito species. A total of 6153 female mosquitos
from 6 species were collected from 46 sites during June-August of 2008 and 2009. 
Each mosquito's head-thorax and abdomen were separated, categorized with respect 
to species and collection area and pooled for DNA extraction. A total of 1198
genomic DNA pools (599 thorax-head, 599 abdomen) were constituted of which 128
pools (59 thorax-head, 69 abdomen) were positive for avian haemosporidian
parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) by Nested-PCR analysis. Culex pipens,
Aedes vexans, Culex theileri and Culiseta annulata were positive with minimum
infection rates (MIRs) of 16.22 and 18.15, 4.72 and 5.98, 5.18 and 10.36, 10.64
and 10.64 in their thorax-head and abdomen parts, respectively. No avian
haemosporidian DNA was detected from Culex hortensis and Anopheles maculipennis. 
Phylogenetic analyses of the partial cytb gene of avian haemosporidian mt-DNA
from 13 positive pools revealed that 11 lineages in four phylogenic groups were
Plasmodium and the other two were Haemoproteus. Our results suggest that Cx.
pipiens could probably be the major vector of avian Plasmodium in Central Turkey.
This is the first report of molecular detection and characterization of avian
Plasmodium lineages from mosquitoes in Turkey.
