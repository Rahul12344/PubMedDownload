The rapid spread of antimalarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum over
the past few decades has necessitated intensive monitoring of such resistance for
an effective malaria control strategy. P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase
(Pfdhps) and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) genes act as
molecular markers for resistance against the antimalarial drugs sulphadoxine and 
pyrimethamine, respectively. Resistance to pyrimethamine which is used as a
partner drug in artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is associated with several 
mutations in the Pfdhfr gene, namely A16V, N51I, C59R, S108N/T and I164L.
Therefore, routine monitoring of Pfdhfr-drug-resistant alleles in a population
may help in effective drug resistance management. Allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) is 
one of the commonly used methods for molecular genotyping of these alleles. In
this study, we genotyped 55 samples of P. falciparum for allele discrimination at
four codons of Pfdhfr (N51, C59, S108 and I164) by ASPCR using published methods 
and by Sanger's DNA sequencing method. We found that the ASPCR identified a
significantly higher number of mutant alleles as compared to the DNA sequencing
method. Such discrepancies arise due to the non-specificity of some of the
allele-specific primer sets and due to the lack of sensitivity of Sanger's DNA
sequencing method to detect minor alleles present in multiple clone infections.
This study reveals the need of a highly specific and sensitive method for
genotyping and detecting minor drug-resistant alleles present in multiple clonal 
infections.
