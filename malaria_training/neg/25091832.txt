Plasmodium parasite utilizes superoxide dismutase family proteins to limit the
toxicity of reactive oxygen species, such as produced through hemoglobin
degradation. These proteins play an important role in parasite survival during
intra-erythrocytic phase. We have identified, and biochemically characterized a
putative iron dependent superoxide dismutase from rodent malaria parasite
Plasmodium vinckei (PvSOD1). The recombinant PvSOD1 protein was purified to
homogeneity through a combination of affinity and gel filtration chromatography. 
Crosslinking, Native-PAGE and FPLC gel filtration analyses documented that PvSOD1
exists as a dimer in solution, a common feature shared by other Fe-SODs. PvSOD1
is cytosolic in localization and its expression is comparatively higher during
trophozoite as compared to that of ring and schizont stages. Enzymatic activity
of recombinant PvSOD1 was validated using conventional zymogram analyses and
xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Under optimal conditions, PvSOD1 was highly
active and catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide radicals. Furthermore, PvSOD1 
showed activity over a broad range of pH and temperature. Inhibition studies
suggested that PvSOD1 was inactivated by hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite,
but not by cyanide and azide. Since, PvSOD1 plays a central role in oxidative
defense mechanism, therefore, characterization of PvSOD1 will be exploited in the
screening of new superoxide dismutase inhibitors for their antimalarial activity.
