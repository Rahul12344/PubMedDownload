A family of apicomplexa-specific proteins containing AP2 DNA-binding domains
(ApiAP2s) was identified in malaria parasites. This family includes
sequence-specific transcription factors that are key regulators of development.
However, functions for the majority of ApiAP2 genes remain unknown. Here, a
systematic knockout screen in Plasmodium berghei identified ten ApiAP2 genes that
were essential for mosquito transmission: four were critical for the formation of
infectious ookinetes, and three were required for sporogony. We describe
non-essential functions for AP2-O and AP2-SP proteins in blood stages, and
identify AP2-G2 as a repressor active in both asexual and sexual stages.
Comparative transcriptomics across mutants and developmental stages revealed
clusters of co-regulated genes with shared cis promoter elements, whose
expression can be controlled positively or negatively by different ApiAP2
factors. We propose that stage-specific interactions between ApiAP2 proteins on
partly overlapping sets of target genes generate the complex transcriptional
network that controls the Plasmodium life cycle.
