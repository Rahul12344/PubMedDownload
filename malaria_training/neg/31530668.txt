Plasmodium falciparum has a complex life cycle that involves interaction with
multiple tissues inside the human and mosquito hosts. Identification of essential
genes at all different stages of the P. falciparum life cycle is urgently
required for clinical development of tools for malaria control and eradication.
However, the study of P. falciparum is limited by the inability to genetically
modify the parasite throughout its life cycle with the currently available
genetic tools. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of a new
marker-free P. falciparum parasite line that expresses rapamycin-inducible Cre
recombinase across the full life cycle. Using this parasite line, we were able to
conditionally delete the essential invasion ligand AMA1 in three different
developmental stages for the first time. We further confirm efficient gene
deletion by targeting the nonessential kinase FIKK7.1.IMPORTANCE One of the major
limitations in studying P. falciparum is that so far only asexual stages are
amenable to rapid conditional genetic modification. The most promising drug
targets and vaccine candidates, however, have been refractory to genetic
modification because they are essential during the blood stage or for
transmission in the mosquito vector. This leaves a major gap in our understanding
of parasite proteins in most life cycle stages and hinders genetic validation of 
drug and vaccine targets. Here, we describe a method that supports conditional
gene deletion across the P. falciparum life cycle for the first time. We
demonstrate its potential by deleting essential and nonessential genes at
different parasite stages, which opens up completely new avenues for the study of
malaria and drug development. It may also allow the realization of novel
vaccination strategies using attenuated parasites.
