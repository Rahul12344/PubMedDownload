Earlier genetic and inhibitor studies showed that epigenetic regulation of gene
expression is critical for malaria parasite survival in multiple life stages and 
a promising target for new antimalarials. We therefore evaluated the activity of 
350 diverse epigenetic inhibitors against multiple stages of Plasmodium
falciparum We observed ≥90% inhibition at 10 μM for 28% of compounds against
asexual blood stages and early gametocytes, of which a third retained ≥90%
inhibition at 1 μM.
