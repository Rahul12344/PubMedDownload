BACKGROUND: Human cerebral malaria (HCM) is a severe form of malaria
characterized by sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) in brain
microvessels, increased levels of circulating free heme and pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, brain swelling, vascular dysfunction, coma, and
increased mortality. Neuregulin-1β (NRG-1) encoded by the gene NRG1, is a member 
of a family of polypeptide growth factors required for normal development of the 
nervous system and the heart. Utilizing an experimental cerebral malaria (ECM)
model (Plasmodium berghei ANKA in C57BL/6), we reported that NRG-1 played a
cytoprotective role in ECM and that circulating levels were inversely correlated 
with ECM severity. Intravenous infusion of NRG-1 reduced ECM mortality in mice by
promoting a robust anti-inflammatory response coupled with reduction in
accumulation of IRBCs in microvessels and reduced tissue damage.
METHODS: In the current study, we examined how NRG-1 treatment attenuates
pathogenesis and mortality associated with ECM. We examined whether NRG-1
protects against CXCL10- and heme-induced apoptosis using human brain
microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells and M059K neuroglial cells. hCMEC/D3
cells grown in a monolayer and a co-culture system with 30 μM heme and NRG-1
(100 ng/ml) were used to examine the role of NRG-1 on blood brain barrier (BBB)
integrity. Using the in vivo ECM model, we examined whether the reduction of
mortality was associated with the activation of ErbB4 and AKT and inactivation of
STAT3 signaling pathways. For data analysis, unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA
with Dunnett's or Bonferroni's post test was applied.
RESULTS: We determined that NRG-1 protects against cell death/apoptosis of human 
brain microvascular endothelial cells and neroglial cells, the two major
components of BBB. NRG-1 treatment improved heme-induced disruption of the in
vitro BBB model consisting of hCMEC/D3 and human M059K cells. In the ECM murine
model, NRG-1 treatment stimulated ErbB4 phosphorylation (pErbB4) followed by
activation of AKT and inactivation of STAT3, which attenuated ECM mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a potential pathway by which NRG-1 treatment
maintains BBB integrity in vitro, attenuates ECM-induced tissue injury, and
reduces mortality. Furthermore, we postulate that augmenting NRG-1 during ECM
therapy may be an effective adjunctive therapy to reduce CNS tissue injury and
potentially increase the effectiveness of current anti-malaria therapy against
human cerebral malaria (HCM).
