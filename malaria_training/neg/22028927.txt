Recent reports highlight the severity and the morbidity of disease caused by the 
long neglected malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. Due to inherent difficulties in
the laboratory-propagation of P. vivax, the biology of this parasite has not been
adequately explored. While the proteome of P. falciparum, the causative agent of 
cerebral malaria, has been extensively explored from several sources, there is
limited information on the proteome of P. vivax. We have, for the first time,
examined the proteome of P. vivax isolated directly from patients without
adaptation to laboratory conditions. We have identified 153 proteins from
clinical P. vivax, majority of which do not show homology to any previously known
gene products. We also report 29 new proteins that were found to be expressed in 
P. vivax for the first time. In addition, several proteins previously implicated 
as anti-malarial targets, were also found in our analysis. Most importantly, we
found several unique proteins expressed by P. vivax.This study is an important
step in providing insight into physiology of the parasite under clinical
settings.
