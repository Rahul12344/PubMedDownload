Antimalarial compounds with dual therapeutic and transmission-blocking activity
are desired as high-value partners for combination therapies. Here, we report the
identification and characterization of hexahydroquinolines (HHQs) that show low
nanomolar potency against both pathogenic and transmissible intra-erythrocytic
forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This activity translates
into potent transmission-blocking potential, as shown by in vitro male gamete
formation assays and reduced oocyst infection and prevalence in Anopheles
mosquitoes. In vivo studies illustrated the ability of lead HHQs to suppress
Plasmodium berghei blood-stage parasite proliferation. Resistance selection
studies, confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, identified the digestive
vacuole membrane-spanning transporter PfMDR1 (P. falciparum multidrug resistance 
gene-1) as a determinant of parasite resistance to HHQs. Haemoglobin and haem
fractionation assays suggest a mode of action that results in reduced haemozoin
levels and might involve inhibition of host haemoglobin uptake into
intra-erythrocytic parasites. Furthermore, parasites resistant to HHQs displayed 
increased susceptibility to several first-line antimalarial drugs, including
lumefantrine, confirming that HHQs have a different mode of action to other
antimalarials drugs for which PfMDR1 is known to confer resistance. This work
evokes therapeutic strategies that combine opposing selective pressures on this
parasite transporter as an approach to countering the emergence and transmission 
of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria.
