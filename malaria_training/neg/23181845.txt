BACKGROUND: Understanding the population structure of Plasmodium species through 
genetic diversity studies can assist in the design of more effective malaria
control strategies, particularly in vaccine development. Central America is an
area where malaria is a public health problem, but little is known about the
genetic diversity of the parasite's circulating species. This study aimed to
investigate the allelic frequency and molecular diversity of five surface
antigens in field isolates from Honduras.
METHODS: Five molecular markers were analysed to determine the genotypes of
Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum from endemic areas in Honduras.
Genetic diversity of ama-1, msp-1 and csp was investigated for P. vivax, and
msp-1 and msp-2 for P. falciparum. Allelic frequencies were calculated and
sequence analysis performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high genetic diversity was observed within Plasmodium
isolates from Honduras. A different number of genotypes were elucidated: 41
(n = 77) for pvama-1; 23 (n = 84) for pvcsp; and 23 (n = 35) for pfmsp-1. Pvcsp
sequences showed VK210 as the only subtype present in Honduran isolates. Pvmsp-1 
(F2) was the most polymorphic marker for P. vivax isolates while pvama-1 was
least variable. All three allelic families described for pfmsp-1 (n = 30) block 2
(K1, MAD20, and RO33), and both allelic families described for the central domain
of pfmsp-2 (n = 11) (3D7 and FC27) were detected. However, K1 and 3D7 allelic
families were predominant. All markers were randomly distributed across the
country and no geographic correlation was found. To date, this is the most
complete report on molecular characterization of P. vivax and P. falciparum field
isolates in Honduras with regards to genetic diversity. These results indicate
that P. vivax and P. falciparum parasite populations are highly diverse in
Honduras despite the low level of transmission.
