Increased interleukin-10 and interferon-γ levels in Plasmodium vivax malaria
suggest a reciprocal regulation which is not altered by IL-10 gene promoter
polymorphism.

BACKGROUND: In human malaria, the naturally-acquired immune response can result
in either the elimination of the parasite or a persistent response mediated by
cytokines that leads to immunopathology. The cytokines are responsible for all
the symptoms, pathological alterations and the outcome of the infection depends
on the reciprocal regulation of the pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. IL-10
and IFN-gamma are able to mediate this process and their production can be
affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene of these cytokines. In
this study, the relationship between cytokine IL-10/IFN-gamma levels,
parasitaemia, and their gene polymorphisms was examined and the participation of 
pro-inflammatory and regulatory balance during a natural immune response in
Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals was observed.
METHODS: The serum levels of the cytokines IL-4, IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-10 from 
132 patients were evaluated by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA). The polymorphism at position +874 of the IFN-gamma gene was identified
by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) method, and the
polymorphism at position -1082 of the IL-10 gene was analysed by PCR-RFLP
(PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism).
RESULTS: The levels of a pro- (IFN-gamma) and an anti-inflammatory cytokine
(IL-10) were significantly higher in P. vivax-infected individuals as compared to
healthy controls. The IFN-gamma levels in primoinfected patients were
significantly higher than in patients who had suffered only one and more than one
previous episode. The mutant alleles of both IFN-gamma and IL-10 genes were more 
frequent than the wild allele. In the case of the IFNG+874 polymorphism
(IFN-gamma) the frequencies of the mutant (A) and wild (T) alleles were 70.13%
and 29.87%, respectively. Similar frequencies were recorded in IL-10-1082, with
the mutant (A) allele returning a frequency of 70.78%, and the wild (G) allele a 
frequency of 29.22%. The frequencies of the alleles associated with reduced
production of both IFN-gamma and IL-10 were high, but this effect was only
observed in the production of IFN-gamma.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown evidence of reciprocal regulation of the levels
of IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokines in P. vivax malaria, which is not altered by the
presence of polymorphism in the IL-10 gene.
