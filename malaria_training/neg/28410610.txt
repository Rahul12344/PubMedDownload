BACKGROUND: Imported cases of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum and
treatment failure with artemisinin-based regimens, although rare, have been
described also in Western countries and their management is often challenging.
This is also due to an inadequate knowledge and implementation of health
prevention measures.
CASE REPORT: A complex case of imported malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax/P.
falciparum isolates in a patient who was not taking chemoprophylaxis while he was
travelling in Cambodia is reported in this article. After failures of
artemisinin-based and both oral and intravenous quinine-based regimens, a
multidrug resistant P. falciparum was detected. The patient was successfully
treated with atovaquone-proguanil.
CONCLUSIONS: This experience highlights the importance of a careful management
that should be based not only on the most up-to-date guidelines, but also on the 
awareness of a rapidly evolving scenario.
