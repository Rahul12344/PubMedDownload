BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) is a potential
malaria vaccine candidate, but various polymorphisms of the pfcsp gene among
global P. falciparum population become the major barrier to the effectiveness of 
vaccines. This study aimed to investigate the genetic polymorphisms and natural
selection of pfcsp in Bioko and the comparison among global P. falciparum
population.
METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2018, 148 blood samples were collected
from P. falciparum infected Bioko patients and 96 monoclonal sequences of them
were successfully acquired and analysed with 2200 global pfcsp sequences mined
from MalariaGEN Pf3k Database and NCBI.
RESULTS: In Bioko, the N-terminus of pfcsp showed limited genetic variations and 
the numbers of repetitive sequences (NANP/NVDP) were mainly found as 40 (35%) and
41 (34%) in central region. Most polymorphic characters were found in Th2R/Th3R
region, where natural selection (p > 0.05) and recombination occurred. The
overall pattern of Bioko pfcsp gene had no obvious deviation from African
mainland pfcsp (Fst = 0.00878, p < 0.05). The comparative analysis of Bioko and
global pfcsp displayed the various mutation patterns and obvious geographic
differentiation among populations from four continents (p < 0.05). The global
pfcsp C-terminal sequences were clustered into 138 different haplotypes (H_1 to
H_138). Only 3.35% of sequences matched 3D7 strain haplotype (H_1).
CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphism phenomena of pfcsp were found universal in 
Bioko and global isolates and the majority mutations located at T cell epitopes. 
Global genetic polymorphism and geographical characteristics were recommended to 
be considered for future improvement of malaria vaccine design.
