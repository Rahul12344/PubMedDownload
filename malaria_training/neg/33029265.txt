Recent evidence suggests that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9), a downmodulator of cellular uptake of blood cholesterol, also negatively
impacts host immune response to microbial infection. In this study, we
investigated whether carrying the loss-of-function (LOF) rs562556 (c.1420 A > G; 
p.I474 V) PCSK9 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affected the outcome of
severe malaria in children. Archival DNA of a cohort of 207 Malian children
suffering from severe malaria was genotyped for the rs562556 SNP. Sixty-four
children were either heterozygous or homozygous for the minor G allele
(carriers); 143 children were homozygous for the common A allele (noncarriers).
Among carriers, there was one mortality case (1.6%), compared to 15 cases (10.5%)
among noncarriers (p=0.0251), suggesting that the G allele is associated with
better survival in severe malaria. Intriguingly, this allele did not negatively
segregate with any of the clinical symptoms linked to mortality in this cohort.
Studies are needed to determine whether PCSK9 inactivation promotes a protective 
immune response to malaria infection.
