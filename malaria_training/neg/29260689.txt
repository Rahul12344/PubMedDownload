One of the fundamental steps toward malaria control is the use of antimalarial
drugs. The success of antimalarial treatment can be affected by the presence of
drug-resistant populations of Plasmodium falciparum. To assess resistance, we
used molecular methods to examine 351 P. falciparum isolates collected from 4
sentinel sites in Mozambique for K13, pfmdr1, pfcrt, and pfdhps polymorphisms and
for plasmepsin2 (pfpm2) and pfmdr1 copy numbers. We found multiple copies of
pfpm2 in 1.1% of isolates. All isolates carried K13 wild-type alleles (3D7-like),
except 4 novel polymorphisms (Leu619Leu, Phe656Ile, Val666Val, Gly690Gly).
Prevalence of isolates with pfcrt mutant (K76T) allele was low (2.3%). Prevalence
of isolates with pfdhps mutant alleles (A437G and K540E) was >80%, indicating
persistence of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance; however, markers of
artemisinin were absent, and markers of piperaquine resistance were low.
Piperaquine resistance isolates may spread in Mozambique as
dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine drug pressure increases.
