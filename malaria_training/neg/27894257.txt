BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP7) is a Plasmodium protein which 
is involved in parasite invasion; the gene encoding it belongs to a multigene
family. It has been proposed that MSP7 paralogues seem to be functionally
redundant; however, recent experiments have suggested that they could have
different roles.
RESULTS: The msp7 multigene family has been described in newly available
Plasmodium genomes; phylogenetic relationships were established in 12 species by 
using different molecular evolutionary approaches for assessing functional
divergence amongst MSP7 members. Gene expansion and contraction rule msp7 family 
evolution; however, some members could have had concerted evolution. Molecular
evolutionary analysis showed that relaxed and/or intensified selection modulated 
Plasmodium msp7 paralogous evolution. Furthermore, episodic diversifying
selection and changes in evolutionary rates suggested that some paralogous
proteins have diverged functionally.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though msp7 has mainly evolved in line with a birth-and-death
evolutionary model, gene conversion has taken place between some paralogous genes
allowing them to maintain their functional redundancy. On the other hand, the
evolutionary rate of some MSP7 paralogs has become altered, as well as undergoing
relaxed or intensified (positive) selection, suggesting functional divergence.
This could mean that some MSP7s can form different parasite protein complexes
and/or recognise different host receptors during parasite invasion. These results
highlight the importance of this gene family in the Plasmodium genus.
