The transmission of malaria parasites depends on the presence of sexual stages
(gametocytes) in the blood, making the ratio and densities of female and male
gametocytes important determinants of parasite fitness. This manuscript describes
the development of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to
separately quantify mature female and male gametocytes of the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and reveals that Pfs25 mRNA is expressed only in 
female gametocytes. The female (Pfs25) and male (Pfs230p) gametocyte specific
RT-qPCR assays have lower detection limits of 0.3 female and 1.8 male gametocytes
per microlitre of blood, respectively, making them more sensitive than
microscopy. Accurate quantification of the ratio and densities of female and male
gametocytes will increase understanding of P. falciparum transmission and improve
the evaluation of transmission blocking interventions.
