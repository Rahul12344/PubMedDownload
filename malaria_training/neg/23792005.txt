Host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites driven by gliding motility and
empowered by actin-based movement is essential for parasite survival and
pathogenicity. The parasites share a conserved invasion process: actin-based
motility led by the coordination of adhesin-cytoskeleton via aldolase. A number
of studies of host cell invasion in the Plasmodium species and Toxoplasma gondii 
have been performed. However, the mechanisms of host cell invasion by Babesia
species have not yet been studied. Here, we show that Babesia gibsoni aldolase
(BgALD) forms a complex with B. gibsoni thrombospondin-related anonymous protein 
(BgTRAP) and B. gibsoni actin (BgACT), depending on tryptophan-734 (W-734) in
BgTRAP. In addition, actin polymerization is mediated by BgALD. Moreover,
cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin polymerization, suppressed B. gibsoni
parasite growth and inhibited the host cell invasion by parasites, indicating
that actin dynamics are essential for erythrocyte invasion by B. gibsoni. This
study is the first molecular approach to determine the invasion mechanisms of
Babesia species.
