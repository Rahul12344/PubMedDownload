BACKGROUND: The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin has been
identified in Asia and some parts of Africa. The drug resistance of P. falciparum
will be an obstacle to the successful elimination of malaria by 2025.
Whole-genome sequencing of the artemisinin-resistant parasite line revealed
mutations on the k13 gene associated with drug resistance in P. falciparum. To
understand the artemisinin resistance of the imported P. falciparum cases from
Africa, the mutations in the k13 gene in parasites from imported malaria cases in
Guangxi Province were detected and the treatment efficiency of artesunate
monotherapy was observed.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 319 blood samples from migrant workers with P.
falciparum infection who returned to their hometown in Guangxi Province from
Africa between 2014 and 2017. The k13-propeller gene was amplified by nested PCR,
and sequencing, gene mutation frequency and geographic difference of imported P. 
falciparum cases were analysed by comparison with the wild-type strain. Of 319
patients, 158 were P. falciparum-infected and were treated with intravenous
injection of artesunate and were observed, including the time of asexual stage
clearance and the dose of artesunate used.
RESULTS: Of the 319 P. falciparum samples, 12 samples had the k13-propeller
mutation, and 11 point mutations were detected; 5 were non-synonymous mutations
(T474I, A481T, A578S, V603E, G665S) and were not associated with artemisinin
resistance. The clinical treatment observation showed that the median (IQR) dose 
of artesunate for peripheral blood parasite asexual stage clearance was 407.55
(360-510) mg, and the D3 parasite clearance rate was 70.25%, including the five
k13-propeller mutations of P. falciparum. After 7 days of treatment, 98.73% of
cases were cleared. Two cases were treated with artemisinin for 8 days with a
960-mg dose to completely clear the asexual parasite, but they did not have a
mutation in the k13 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Five mutations of the k13-propeller gene in 319 P. falciparum
samples from patients returning from Africa were identified. The frequency of the
k13-propeller mutants was low, and the mutations were not strongly associated
with artemisinin resistance. The median (IQR) dose of artesunate monotherapy in
actual clinical treatment to remove asexual parasite stages was 407.55 (360-510) 
mg, equivalent to D3-D4. Some P. falciparum cases without a k13-propeller
mutation showed obvious delayed clearance of the parasite from peripheral blood. 
Trial registration The diagnosis of malaria and the treatment of malaria-infected
patients are the routine work of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
Information on the patients was conveyed with the patient's approval, and the
research aim, methods, risks and benefits of the study were explained in detail
to the patients.
