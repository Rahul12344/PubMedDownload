Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium species. Most of the
imported malaria in Korea are due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, 
and Plasmodium ovale infections are very rare. Here, we report a case of a
24-year-old American woman who acquired P. ovale while staying in Ghana, West
Africa for 5 months in 2010. The patient was diagnosed with P. ovale malaria
based on a Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear, Plasmodium
genus-specific real-time PCR, Plasmodium species-specific nested PCR, and
sequencing targeting 18S rRNA gene. The strain identified had a very long
incubation period of 19-24 months. Blood donors who have malaria with a very long
incubation period could be a potential danger for propagating malaria. Therefore,
we should identify imported P. ovale infections not only by morphological
findings but also by molecular methods for preventing propagation and appropriate
treatment.
