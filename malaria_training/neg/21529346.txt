BACKGROUND: To develop a plant-based vaccine against Plasmodium vivax, two P.
vivax candidate proteins were chosen. First, the merozoite surface protein-1
(MSP-1), a major asexual blood stage antigen that is currently considered a
strong vaccine candidate. Second, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a component
of sporozoites that contains a B-cell epitope.
METHODS: A synthetic chimeric recombinant 516 bp gene encoding containing
PvMSP-1, a Pro-Gly linker motif, and PvCSP was synthesized; the gene, named MLC, 
encoded a total of 172 amino acids. The recombinant gene was modified with regard
to codon usage to optimize gene expression in Brassica napus. The Ti plasmid
inducible gene transfer system was used for MLC chimeric recombinant gene
expression in B. napus. Gene expression was confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) assay, and Western blot.
RESULTS: The MLC chimeric recombinant protein expressed in B. napus had a
molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. It exhibited a clinical sensitivity of 
84.21% (n=38) and a clinical specificity of 100% (n=24) as assessed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with 
MLC chimeric recombinant protein successfully induced antigen-specific IgG1
production. Additionally, the Th1-related cytokines IL-12 (p40), TNF, and IFN-Î³
were significantly increased in the spleens of the BALB/c mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The chimeric MLC recombinant protein produced in B. napus has
potential as both as an antigen for diagnosis and as a valuable vaccine candidate
for oral immunization against vivax malaria.
