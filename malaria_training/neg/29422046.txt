BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) has been the most 
studied ligand binding human reticulocytes to date. This molecule has a
cysteine-rich domain in region II (RII) which has been used as control for
evaluating the target cell binding activity of several parasite molecules.
However, obtaining rPvDBP-RII in a soluble form using the Escherichia coli
expression system usually requires laborious and time-consuming steps for
recovering the molecule's structure and function, considering it is extracted
from inclusion bodies. The present study describes an easy and fast method for
expressing and obtaining several PvDBP fragments which should prove ideal for use
in protein-cell interaction assays.
RESULTS: Two PvDBP encoding regions (rii and riii/v) were cloned in pEXP5-CT
vector and expressed in E. coli and extracted from the soluble fraction
(rPvDBP-RIIS and rPvDBP-RIII/VS) using a simple freezing/thawing protocol. After 
the purification, dichroism analysis enabled verifying high rPvDBP-RIIS and
rPvDBP-RIII/VS secondary structure α-helix content, which was lowered when
molecules were extracted from inclusion bodies (rPvDBP-RIIIB and rPvDBP-RIII/VIB)
using a denaturing step. Interestingly, rPvDBP-RIIS, but not rPvDBP-RIIIB, bound 
to human reticulocytes, while rPvDBP-RIII/VS and rPvDBP-RIII/VIB bound to such
cells in a similar way to negative control (cells incubated without recombinant
proteins).
CONCLUSIONS: This research has shown for the first time how rPvDBP-RII can be
expressed and obtained in soluble form using the E. coli system and avoiding the 
denaturation and refolding steps commonly used. The results highlight the
usefulness of the rPvDBP-RIII/VS fragment as a non-binding control for
protein-cell target interaction assays. The soluble extraction protocol described
is a good alternative to obtain fully functional P. vivax proteins in a fast and 
easy way, which will surely prove useful to laboratories working in studying this
parasite's biology.
