In South America, Plasmodium vivax resistance to chloroquine was recently
reported in Brazil and Bolivia. The objective of this study was to collect data
on chloroquine resistance in French Guiana by associating a retrospective
evaluation of therapeutic efficacy with an analysis of recurrent parasitemia from
any patients. Patients with P. vivax infection, confirmed by microscopy and a
body temperature of ≥37.5°C, were retrospectively identified at Cayenne Hospital 
between 2009 and 2015. Follow-up and treatment responses were performed according
to the World Health Organization protocol. Parasite resistance was confirmed
after dosage of a plasma concentration of chloroquine and microsatellite
characterization. The pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes were analyzed for sequence and
gene copy number variation. Among the 172 patients followed for 28 days, 164
presented adequate clinical and parasitological responses. Eight cases of
treatment failures were identified (4.7%; n = 8/172), all after 14 days. The
therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine was estimated at 95.3% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 92.5 to 98.1%; n = 164/172). Among the eight failures, five were
characterized: two cases were true P. vivax chloroquine resistance (1.2%; 95% CI,
0 to 2.6%; n = 2/172), and three cases were found with subtherapeutic
concentrations of chloroquine. No particular polymorphism in the Plasmodium vivax
pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes was identified in the resistant parasites. This
identified level of resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine in French Guiana does
not require a change in therapeutic recommendations. However, primaquine should
be administered more frequently to limit the spread of resistance, and there is
still a need for a reliable molecular marker to facilitate the monitoring of P.
vivax resistance to chloroquine.
