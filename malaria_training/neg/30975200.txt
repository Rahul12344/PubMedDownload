BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is widely distributed across tropical regions and
has two closely related but distinct species, namely P. ovale curtisi and P.
ovale wallikeri. Combining genetic characterization with the immunogenicity of
merozoite surface protein-8 (MSP-8) supports considering MSP-8 as a candidate
target for blood-stage vaccines against malaria. However, no previous studies
have focused on characterizing the genetic diversity and immunogenicity of
PoMSP-8.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 42 patients infected with P. ovale.
The patients were migrant workers returning to the Jiangsu Province from Africa; 
genomic DNA was extracted from their blood samples for sequencing and protein
expression. The recombinant PoMSP-8 (rPoMSP-8) proteins were expressed and
purified to assess their immune responses in BALB/c mice.
RESULTS: The sequences of the P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri msp8 genes 
were completely conserved in each isolate. The rPoMSP-8 proteins were
successfully expressed and purified as ~70Â kDa proteins. Antibodies raised
against rPoMSP-8 in mice showed appropriate immunoreactivity, as evidenced by
immunoblotting. These specific antibodies were detected at day 7
post-immunization, and their levels increased throughout the whole immunization
period. rPoMSP-8-raised antibodies had high endpoint titers (1:5,120,000) and
high avidity (PocMSP-8: 94.84%, PowMSP-8: 92.69%). Cross-reactivity between
rPocMSP-8 and rPowMSP-8 was observed with each anti-PoMSP8-specific antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: Remarkable conservation and high immunogenicity was observed in both
rPoMSP-8s. Intriguingly, cross-reaction between rPocMSP-8 and rPowMSP-8 was
detected, suggesting that a single PoMSP8-based construction might be applicable 
for both species.
