BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has recommended rapid diagnostic tests 
(RDTs) for use in the diagnosis of suspected malaria cases. In addition to
providing quick and accurate detection of Plasmodium parasite proteins in the
blood, these tests can be used as sources of DNA for further genetic studies. As 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is used currently for intermittent presumptive
treatment of pregnant women in both Senegal and in the Comoros Islands,
resistance mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes were investigated using DNA
extracted from RDTs.
METHODS: The proximal portion of the nitrocellulose membrane of discarded RDTs
was used for DNA extraction. This genomic DNA was amplified using HRM to genotype
the molecular markers involved in resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine: dhfr
(51, 59, 108, and 164) and dhps (436, 437, 540, 581, and 613). Additionally, the 
msp1 and msp2 genes were amplified to determine the average clonality between
Grande-Comore (Comoros) and Thiès (Senegal).
RESULTS: A total of 201 samples were successfully genotyped at all codons by HRM;
whereas, in 200 msp1 and msp2 genes were successfully amplified and genotyped by 
nested PCR. A high prevalence of resistance mutations were observed in the dhfr
gene at codons 51, 59, and 108 as well as in the dhps gene at codons 437 and 436.
A novel mutant in dhps at codon positions 436Y/437A was observed. The dhfr I164L 
codon and dhps K540 and dhps A581G codons had 100 % wild type alleles in all
samples.
CONCLUSION: The utility of field-collected RDTs was validated as a source of DNA 
for genetic studies interrogating frequencies of drug resistance mutations, using
two different molecular methods (PCR and High Resolution Melting). RDTs should
not be discarded after use as they can be a valuable source of DNA for genetic
and epidemiological studies in sites where filter paper or venous blood collected
samples are nonexistent.
