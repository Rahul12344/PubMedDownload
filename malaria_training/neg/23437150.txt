BACKGROUND: Pentastomiasis is a rare zoonotic disease caused by pentastomids.
Despite their worm-like appearance, they are commonly placed into a separate
sub-class of the subphylum Crustacea, phylum Arthropoda. However, until now, the 
systematic classification of the pentastomids and the diagnosis of pentastomiasis
are immature, and genetic information about pentastomid nylum is almost
nonexistent. The objective of this study was to obtain information on pentastomid
nymph genes and identify the gene homologues related to host-parasite
interactions or stage-specific antigens.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total pentastomid nymph RNA was used to construct
a cDNA library and 500 colonies were sequenced. Analysis shows one hundred and
ninety-seven unigenes were identified. In which, 147 genes were annotated, and 75
unigenes (53.19%) were mapped to 82 KEGG pathways, including 29 metabolism
pathways, 29 genetic information processing pathways, 4 environmental information
processing pathways, 7 cell motility pathways and 5 organismal systems pathways. 
Additionally, two host-parasite interaction-related gene homologues, a putative
Kunitz inhibitor and a putative cysteine protease.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We first successfully constructed a cDNA library and
gained a number of expressed sequence tags (EST) from pentastomid nymphs, which
will lay the foundation for the further study on pentastomids and pentastomiasis.
