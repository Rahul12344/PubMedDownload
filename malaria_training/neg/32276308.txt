Despite the amount of resources deployed and the technological advancements in
molecular biology, vaccinology, immunology, genetics, and biotechnology, there
are still no effective vaccines against malaria. Immunity to malaria is usually
seen to be species- and/or strain-specific. However, there is a growing body of
evidence suggesting the possibility of the existence of cross-strain,
cross-species, and cross-genus immune responses in apicomplexans. The principle
of gene conservation indicates that homologues play a similar role in closely
related organisms. The homologue of UB05 in Theileria parva is TpUB05
(XP_763711.1), which has been tested and shown to be associated with protective
immunity in East Coast fever. In a bid to identify potent markers of protective
immunity to aid malaria vaccine development, TpUB05 was tested in malaria caused 
by Plasmodium falciparum. It was observed that TpUB05 was better at detecting
antigen-specific antibodies in plasma compared to UB05 when tested by ELISA. The 
total IgG raised against TpUB05 was able to block parasitic growth in vitro more 
effectively than that raised against UB05. However, there was no significant
difference between the two study antigens in recalling peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) memory through IFN-Î³ production. This study suggests, for
the first time, that TpUB05 from T. parva cross-reacts with UB05 from P.
falciparum and is a marker of protective immunity in malaria. Hence, TpUB05
should be considered for possible development as a potential subunit vaccine
candidate against malaria.
