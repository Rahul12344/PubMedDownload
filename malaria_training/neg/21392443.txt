We performed a molecular epidemiologic survey of mutations associated with
drug-resistance genes in Plasmodium falciparum in northeastern Myanmar. In this
region, 3 highly mutated drug-resistance haplotypes and 1 associated with
decreased quinine susceptibility were prevalent, which suggests that parasites
may be resistant to multiple commonly used antimalarial drugs.
