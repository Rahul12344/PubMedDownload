BACKGROUND: Prior to this project, only a handful of online visualizations
existed for exploring the published literature on molecular markers of
antimalarial drug resistance, and none specifically for the markers associated
with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the partner drugs in artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT). Molecular information is collected in studies with
different designs, using a variety of molecular methodologies and data analysis
strategies, making it difficult to compare across studies. The purpose of this
project was to develop a free online tool, which visualizes the widely published 
data on molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance, starting with the two 
genes pfcrt and pfmdr-1, associated with resistance to the three most common
partner drugs; amodiaquine, lumefantrine and mefloquine.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted, and a standardized method was used to
extract data from publications, and critical decisions on visualization were
made. A global geospatial database was developed of specific pfmdr1 and pfcrt
single nucleotide polymorphisms and pfmdr1 copy number variation. An informatics 
framework was developed that allowed flexibility in development of the tool over 
time and efficient adaptation to different source data.
RESULTS: The database discussed in this paper has pfmdr1 and pfcrt marker
prevalence information, from 579 geographic sites in 76 different countries,
including results from over 86,000 samples from 456 articles published January
2001-May 2017. The ACT Partner Drugs Molecular Surveyor was launched by the
WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) in March 2015 and it has
attracted over 3000 unique visitors since then. Presented here is a demonstration
of how the Surveyor database can be explored to monitor local, temporal changes
in the prevalence of molecular markers. Here publications up to May 2017 were
included, however the online ACT partner drug Molecular Surveyor is continuously 
updated with new data and relevant markers.
CONCLUSIONS: The WWARN ACT Partner Drugs Molecular Surveyor summarizes data on
resistance markers in the pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes. The database is fully
accessible, providing users with a rich resource to explore and analyze, and thus
utilize a centralized, standardized database for different purposes. This
open-source software framework can be adapted to other data, as demonstrated by
the subsequent launch of the Artemisinin Molecular Surveyor and the Vivax
Surveyor.
