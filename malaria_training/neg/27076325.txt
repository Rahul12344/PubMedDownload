There are currently no vaccines that provide sterile immunity against malaria.
Various proteins from different stages of the Plasmodium falciparum life cycle
have been evaluated as vaccine candidates, but none of them have fulfilled
expectations. Therefore, combinations of key antigens from different stages of
the parasites life cycle may be essential for the development of efficacious
malaria vaccines. Following the identification of promising antigens using
bioinformatics, proteomics, and/or immunological approaches, it is necessary to
express, purify, and characterize these proteins and explore the potential of
fusion constructs combining different antigens or antigen domains before
committing to expensive and time-consuming clinical development. Here, using
malaria vaccine candidates as an example, we describe how Agrobacterium
tumefaciens-based transient expression in plants can be combined with a modular
and flexible cloning strategy as a robust and versatile tool for the rapid
production of candidate antigens during research and development.
