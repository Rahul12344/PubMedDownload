BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) is generally prescribed as the front-line
antimalarial drug of choice to treat Plasmodium vivax infections; however, some
clinical CQ-resistant P. vivax isolates have been indigenously reported around
the world during the last decade.
METHODS: In this study, P. vivax isolates (n=52) were obtained from autochthonous
samples in southeast Iran during 2015-2017. The genomic DNA of samples was
extracted, amplified (nested PCR) and sequenced by targeting the
multidrug-resistance 1 gene. To verify the global genetic diversity of
CQ-resistant P. vivax strains, the sequences of Pvmdr1 originating from Asia and 
the Americas were retrieved.
RESULTS: A total of 46 haplotypes were grouped into three distinct geographical
haplogroups. The haplotype diversity and occurrence rates of Pvmdr1 976F/1076L
mutations indicate that the efficacy of CQ is being compromised in Mexico, China,
Nicaragua, Thailand, Brazil (2016), Ethiopia, Mauritania (2012) and southwest
India in the near future. The cladistic phylogenetic tree showed that Pvmdr1
sequences isolated from the southeast Asian clade has a partial sister
relationship with the American clade.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings will serve as a basis to develop appropriate
malaria control strategies and public health policies in symptomatic imported
malaria cases or plausible CQ-resistant P. vivax strains.
