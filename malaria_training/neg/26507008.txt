Molecular detection has overcome limitations of microscopic examination by
providing greater sensitivity and specificity in Plasmodium species detection.
The objective of the present study was to develop a quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction coupled with high-resolution melting (qRT-PCR-HRM)
assay for rapid, accurate and simultaneous detection of all five human Plasmodium
spp. A pair of primers targeted the 18S SSU rRNA gene of the Plasmodium spp. was 
designed for qRT-PCR-HRM assay development. Analytical sensitivity and
specificity of the assay were evaluated. Samples collected from 229 malaria
suspected patients recruited from Sabah, Malaysia were screened using the assay
and results were compared with data obtained using PlasmoNex(TM), a hexaplex PCR 
system. The qRT-PCR-HRM assay was able to detect and discriminate the five
Plasmodium spp. with lowest detection limits of 1-100 copy numbers without
nonspecific amplifications. The detection of Plasmodium spp. in clinical samples 
using this assay also achieved 100% concordance with that obtained using
PlasmoNex(TM). This indicated that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 
this assay in Plasmodium spp. detection is comparable with those of
PlasmoNex(TM). The qRT-PCR-HRM assay is simple, produces results in two hours and
enables high-throughput screening. Thus, it is an alternative method for rapid
and accurate malaria diagnosis.
