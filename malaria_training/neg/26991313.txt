Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins belong to the B subfamily of the ATP Binding 
Cassette (ABC) transporters, which export a wide range of compounds including
pharmaceuticals. In this study, we used reverse genetics to study the role of all
seven Plasmodium MDR proteins during the life cycle of malaria parasites. Four P.
berghei genes (encoding MDR1, 4, 6 and 7) were refractory to deletion, indicating
a vital role during blood stage multiplication and validating them as potential
targets for antimalarial drugs. Mutants lacking expression of MDR2, MDR3 and MDR5
were generated in both P. berghei and P. falciparum, indicating a dispensable
role for blood stage development. Whereas P. berghei mutants lacking MDR3 and
MDR5 had a reduced blood stage multiplication in vivo, blood stage growth of P.
falciparum mutants in vitro was not significantly different. Oocyst maturation
and sporozoite formation in Plasmodium mutants lacking MDR2 or MDR5 was reduced. 
Sporozoites of these P. berghei mutants were capable of infecting mice and life
cycle completion, indicating the absence of vital roles during liver stage
development. Our results demonstrate vital and dispensable roles of MDR proteins 
during blood stages and an important function in sporogony for MDR2 and MDR5 in
both Plasmodium species.
