CONCLUSIONS: This update of the Duffy (FY) blood group system (Meny GM. The Duffy
blood group system: a review. Immunohematology 2010;26:51-6) includes additional 
variants to the Duffy system (International Society of Blood Transfusion system
8; five anti-gens) identified through molecular studies. The most interesting
clinical updates, however, include further evaluation of the roles of the Duffy
glycoprotein, also known as the atypical chemokine receptor 1, in malaria and
hematopoiesis. The transition to understanding the important role of blood group 
antigens in homeostasis and disease continues.
