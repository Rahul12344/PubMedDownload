Development of malaria parasites within vertebrate erythrocytes requires nutrient
uptake at the host cell membrane. The plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC)
mediates this transport and is an antimalarial target, but its molecular basis is
unknown. We report a parasite gene family responsible for PSAC activity. We used 
high-throughput screening for nutrient uptake inhibitors to identify a compound
highly specific for channels from the Dd2 line of the human pathogen P.
falciparum. Inheritance of this compound's affinity in a Dd2 × HB3 genetic cross 
maps to a single parasite locus on chromosome 3. DNA transfection and in vitro
selections indicate that PSAC-inhibitor interactions are encoded by two clag3
genes previously assumed to function in cytoadherence. These genes are conserved 
in plasmodia, exhibit expression switching, and encode an integral protein on the
host membrane, as predicted by functional studies. This protein increases host
cell permeability to diverse solutes.
