OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to find out the mutational prevalence of
Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene in Assam
and Arunachal Pradesh, India.
METHODS: To fulfil the objective of the study, a total of 54 P. falciparum
malaria positive samples were attempted for genotyping of Pfcrt gene using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing method.
RESULTS: The K76T mutation was observed in 77.78% cases followed by M74I
(61.11%), N75E (61.11%) and C72S (16.67%). Triple mutant allele M74I+N75E+K76T
was found in 61.11% P. falciparum field isolates. Double mutant allele C72S+K76T 
was seen among 16.67% samples. Mutation studies have shown existence of three
different haplotypes of which two were associated with chloroquine resistance.
The haplotype CVIET was found preponderance and circulated in all four districts.
The other haplotype SVMNT was observed only in Karbi Anglong district of Assam.
Maximum haplotype diversity was also recorded from Karbi Anglong district of
Assam.
CONCLUSION: Our study has confirmed high prevalence of mutant Pfcrt genotypes
associated with chloroquine resistance in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, India.
