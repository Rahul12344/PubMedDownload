Malaria parasites increase erythrocyte permeability to diverse solutes including 
anions, some cations, and organic solutes, as characterized with several
independent methods. Over the past decade, patch-clamp studies have determined
that the permeability results from one or more ion channels on the infected
erythrocyte host membrane. However, the biological role(s) served by these
channels, if any, remain controversial. Recent studies implicate the plasmodial
surface anion channel (PSAC) and a role in parasite nutrient acquisition. A
debated alternative role in remodeling host ion composition for the benefit of
the parasite appears to be nonessential. Because both channel activity and the
associated clag3 genes are strictly conserved in malaria parasites,
channel-mediated permeability is an attractive target for development of new
therapies.
