BACKGROUND: HBB, IL4, IL12, TNF, LTA, NCR3 and FCGR2A polymorphisms have been
associated with malaria resistance in humans, whereas cytophilic immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies are thought to play a critical role in immune protection against
asexual blood stages of the parasite. Furthermore, HBB, IL4, TNF, and FCGR2A have
been associated with both malaria resistance and IgG levels. This suggests that
some malaria resistance genes influence the levels of IgG subclass antibodies.
METHODS: In this study, the effect of HBB, IL4, IL12, TNF, LTA, NCR3 and FCGR2A
polymorphisms on the levels of IgG responses against Plasmodium falciparum
blood-stage extract was investigated in 220 individuals living in Burkina Faso.
The Pearson's correlation coefficient among IgG subclasses was determined. A
family-based approach was used to assess the association of polymorphisms with
anti-P. falciparum IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 levels.
RESULTS: After applying a multiple test correction, several polymorphisms were
associated with IgG subclass or IgG levels. There was an association of i)
haemoglobin C with IgG levels; ii) the FcÎ³RIIa H/R131 with IgG2 and IgG3 levels; 
iii) TNF-863 with IgG3 levels; iv) TNF-857 with IgG levels; and, v) TNF1304 with 
IgG3, IgG4, and IgG levels.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that some
polymorphisms affect malaria resistance through their effect on the acquired
immune response, and pave the way towards further comprehension of genetic
control of an individual's humoral response against malaria.
