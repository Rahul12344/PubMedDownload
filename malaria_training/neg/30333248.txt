Although malaria is the world's most life-threatening parasitic disease, there is
no clear understanding of how certain biophysical properties of infected cells
change during the malaria infection cycle. In this article, we use microfluidic
impedance cytometry to measure the dielectric properties of Plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells (i-RBCs) at specific time points during the
infection cycle. Individual parasites were identified within i-RBCs using green
fluorescent protein (GFP) emission. The dielectric properties of cell
sub-populations were determined using the multi-shell model. Analysis showed that
the membrane capacitance and cytoplasmic conductivity of i-RBCs increased along
the infection time course, due to membrane alterations caused by parasite
infection. The volume ratio occupied by the parasite was estimated to vary from
less than 10% at earlier stages, to approximately 90% at later stages. This
knowledge could be used to develop new label-free cell sorting techniques for
sample pre-enrichment, improving diagnosis.
