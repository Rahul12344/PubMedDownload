Cryptosporidiosis has been reported as an important cause of neonatal diarrhea
and mortality in cattle, sheep, and other ruminants, but its impact on alpaca
health has not been studied thoroughly. In this study, we have determined the
prevalence and evaluated the role of cryptosporidiosis as a risk factor for
diarrhea occurrence in newborn alpacas. During the calving season (January-March)
of 2006, stool specimens (N = 1312) were collected from 24 herds of newborn
alpacas in Puno and Cuzco, departments that account for the largest populations
of alpacas in Peru. All the specimens were microscopically screened for
Cryptosporidium spp. using the acid-fast technique. The association between
Cryptosporidium detection and diarrhea was analyzed using Ï‡2 test and generalized
lineal model. Cryptosporidium species were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis of the
small subunit rRNA gene. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 159 of 1312
(12.4%) newborn alpacas. Results of the analyses demonstrated that
crypstosporidiosis was significantly associated with diarrhea (PR = 3.84; CI95%
2.54-5.81; p < 0.0001). Only Cryptosporidium parvum was detected in the 153
Cryptosporidium-infected animals. Thus, there is an association of C. parvum
infection with diarrhea in neonatal alpacas.
