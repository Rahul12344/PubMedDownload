Therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which is commonly used to
treat falciparum malaria, was assessed in isolates of Plasmodium falciparum
(Welch, 1897) and Plasmodium vivax (Grassi et Feletti, 1890) ofAligarh, Uttar
Pradesh, North India and Taif, Saudi Arabia during 2011-2012. Both the species
showed mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme as they have common
biochemical drug targets. Mutation rate for pfdhfr was higher compared to pvdhfr 
because the drug was mainly given to treat falciparum malaria. Since both the
species coexist, P. vivax was also exposed to SP due to faulty species diagnosis 
or medication without specific diagnosis. Low level of mutations against SP in P.
falciparum of Saudi isolates indicates that the SP combination is still effective
for the treatment of falciparum malaria. Since SP is used as first-line of
treatment because of high level of resistance against chloroquine (CQ), it may
result in spread of higher level of mutations resulting in drug resistance and
treatment failure in near future. Therefore, to avoid further higher mutations in
the parasite, use of better treatment regimens such as artesunate combination
therapy must be introduced against SP combination.
