BACKGROUND: Deltamethrin-impregnated, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were
distributed in the study area from November 2014 to January 2015 to evaluate
their impact on malaria transmission in the presence of insecticide-resistant
vectors. Studies were carried out in 16 selected clusters in Keshkal
sub-district, Chhattisgarh State, India to monitor and characterize deltamethrin 
resistance in Anopheles culicifacies sensu lato.
RESULTS: Deltamethrin susceptibility of An. culicifacies decreased in a post-LLIN
survey compared to a pre-LLIN survey and was not significant (p > 0.05) while,
the knockdown values showed significant increase (p < 0.05). Pre-exposure to
piperonyl butoxide, triphenyl phosphate showed synergism against deltamethrin
(p < 0.001). Biochemical assays showed significantly (p < 0.05) elevated
monooxygenases in 3 of 5 clusters in post-LLIN survey-I that increased to 10 of
11 clusters in post-LLIN survey-II, while esterases were found significantly
elevated in all clusters and both enzymes were involved in conferring pyrethroid 
resistance, not discounting the involvement of kdr (L1014L/S) gene that was
heterozygous and at low frequency (4-5%).
CONCLUSION: This field study, in a tribal district of India, after distribution
of deltamethrin-impregnated LLINs showed decrease in deltamethrin susceptibility 
in An. culicifacies, a major vector of malaria in this study area and in India.
Results indicated development of resistance as imminent with the increase in
insecticide selection pressure. There is an urgent need to develop new vector
control tools, with insecticide classes having novel mechanisms of resistance, to
avoid or delay the onset of resistance. Regular insecticide resistance monitoring
and mechanistic studies should be the priority for the malaria control programmes
to suggest strategies for insecticide resistance management. The global
commitment to eliminate malaria by 2030 needs various efforts that include
development of combination vector control products and interventions and few are 
becoming available.
