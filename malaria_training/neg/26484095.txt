Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) have been detected in many organisms and
shown to regulate gene expression. Similarly, NATs have also been observed in
malaria parasites with most studies focused on Plasmodium falciparum. There were 
no reports on the presence of NATs in Plasmodium vivax, which has also been shown
to cause severe malaria like P. falciparum, until a recent study published by us.
To identify in vivo prevalence of antisense transcripts in P. vivax clinical
isolates, we performed whole genome expression profiling using a custom designed 
strand-specific microarray that contains probes for both sense and antisense
strands. Here we describe the experimental methods and analysis of the microarray
data available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under GSE45165. Our data provides
a resource for exploring the presence of antisense transcripts in P. vivax
isolated from patients showing varying clinical symptoms. Related information
about the description and interpretation of the data can be found in a recent
publication by Boopathi and colleagues in Infection, Genetics and Evolution 2013.
