BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The search for effective polymorphic markers in
Plasmodium vivax is highly demanding to understand its transmission in a
population. Due to the limited knowledge existing for P. vivax, the search for
polymorphic markers for population studies is ongoing. The MSP gene family of
Plasmodia has been linked with immune evasion. To study the circulating parasite 
population P. vivax merozoite surface protein 3β (PvMSP3β) polymorphic marker was
used to investigate the genetic diversity of P. vivax in natural infections.
METHODS: Polymorphism of PvMSP3β gene was determined in 46 P. vivax blood samples
from six different regions of India by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with PstI.
RESULTS: Two different parasite genotypes, viz. type-A and type-B were detected
among 46 samples that were positive for PCR, based on the size of the
amplification. RFLP analysis with PstI showed 22 allelic groups and 15.2% samples
revealed mixed infections on analysis.
CONCLUSION: PvMSP3β was found to be an effective molecular marker for P. vivax as
it shows high diversity in India and multiple genotypes easily distinguishable
without the need for sequencing.
