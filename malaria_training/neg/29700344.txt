Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii, the two most important malaria vectors in
sub-Saharan Africa, are recently radiated sibling species that are reproductively
isolated even in areas of sympatry. In females from these species, sexual
transfer of male accessory gland products, including the steroid hormone
20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), induces vast behavioral, physiological, and
transcriptional changes that profoundly shape their post-mating ecology, and that
may have contributed to the insurgence of post-mating, prezygotic reproductive
barriers. As these barriers can be detected by studying transcriptional changes
induced by mating, we set out to analyze the post-mating response of An. gambiae 
and An. coluzzii females captured in natural mating swarms in Burkina Faso. While
the molecular pathways shaping short- and long-term mating-induced changes are
largely conserved in females from the two species, we unravel significant
inter-specific differences that suggest divergent regulation of key reproductive 
processes such as egg development, processing of seminal secretion, and mating
behavior, that may have played a role in reproductive isolation. Interestingly, a
number of these changes occur in genes previously shown to be regulated by the
sexual transfer of 20E and may be due to divergent utilization of this steroid
hormone in the two species.
