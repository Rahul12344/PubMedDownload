BACKGROUND: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) bears a high burden of
malaria, which is exacerbated in pregnant women. The VAR2CSA protein plays a
crucial role in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), and hence quantifying
diversity at the var2csa locus in the DRC is important in understanding the basic
epidemiology of PAM, and in developing a robust vaccine against PAM.
METHODS: Samples were taken from the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey
conducted in the DRC, focusing on children under 5 years of age. A short
subregion of the var2csa gene was sequenced in 115 spatial clusters, giving
country-wide estimates of sequence polymorphism and spatial population structure.
RESULTS: Results indicate that var2csa is highly polymorphic, and that diversity 
is being maintained through balancing selection, however, there is no clear
signal of phylogenetic or geographic structure to this diversity. Linear
modelling demonstrates that the number of var2csa variants in a cluster
correlates directly with cluster prevalence, but not with other epidemiological
factors such as urbanicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the DRC fits within the global pattern of high 
var2csa diversity and little genetic differentiation between regions. A broad
multivalent VAR2CSA vaccine candidate could benefit from targeting stable regions
and common variants to address the substantial genetic diversity.
