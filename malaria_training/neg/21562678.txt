Chemical genetics can be defined as the study of biological systems using small
molecule tools. Cell permeable and selective small molecules modulate gene
product function rapidly, reversibly and can be administered conditionally in
either a cellular or organismal context. The small molecule approach provides
exacting temporal and quantitative control and is therefore an extremely powerful
tool for dissecting biological processes. This tutorial review has been written
to introduce the subject to a broad audience and highlights recent developments
within the field in four key areas of biology: modulating protein-protein
interactions, malaria research, hepatitis C virus research, and disrupting RNA
interference pathways.
