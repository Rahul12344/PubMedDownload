BACKGROUND: The endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia is maternally inherited and
naturally infects some filarial nematodes and a diverse range of arthropods,
including mosquito vectors responsible for disease transmission in humans.
Previously, it has been found infecting most mosquito species but absent in
Anopheles and Aedes aegypti. However, recently these two mosquito species were
found to be naturally infected with Wolbachia. We report here the extent of
Wolbachia infections in field-collected mosquitoes from Malaysia based on PCR
amplification of the Wolbachia wsp and 16S rRNA genes.
METHODS: The prevalence of Wolbachia in Culicinae mosquitoes was assessed via PCR
with wsp primers. For some of the mosquitoes, in which the wsp primers failed to 
amplify a product, Wolbachia screening was performed using nested PCR targeting
the 16S rRNA gene. Wolbachia sequences were aligned using Geneious 9.1.6
software, analyzed with BLAST, and the most similar sequences were downloaded.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out with MEGA 7.0 software. Graphs were drawn 
with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software.
RESULTS: A total of 217 adult mosquitoes representing 26 mosquito species were
screened. Of these, infections with Wolbachia were detected in 4 and 15 mosquito 
species using wsp and 16S rRNA primers, respectively. To our knowledge, this is
the first time Wolbachia was detected using 16S rRNA gene amplification, in some 
Anopheles species (some infected with Plasmodium), Culex sinensis, Culex vishnui,
Culex pseudovishnui, Mansonia bonneae and Mansonia annulifera. Phylogenetic
analysis based on wsp revealed Wolbachia from most of the mosquitoes belonged to 
Wolbachia Supergroup B. Based on 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis, the Wolbachia
strain from Anopheles mosquitoes were more closely related to WolbachiaÂ infecting
Anopheles from Africa than from Myanmar.
CONCLUSIONS: Wolbachia was found infecting Anopheles and other important disease 
vectors such as Mansonia. Since Wolbachia can affect its host by reducing the
life span and provide resistance to pathogen infection, several studies have
suggested it as a potential innovative tool for vector/vector-borne disease
control. Therefore, it is important to carry out further studies on natural
Wolbachia infection in vector mosquitoes' populations as well as their long-term 
effects in new hosts and pathogen suppression.
