BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum merozoites are free invasive forms that invade 
host erythrocytes in iterative cycles in the presence of different arms of the
immune system. Variant antigens are known to play a role in immune evasion and
several gene families coding for variant antigens have been identified in P.
falciparum. However, none of them have been reported to be expressed on the
surface of merozoites.
METHODS: Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoblotting assays
were performed to assess surface exposure, membrane association and stage
specific expression of the STEVOR family of variants proteins, respectively.
RESULTS: Using a polyclonal antibody (anti-PFL2610w) with a broad specificity
towards different STEVOR variants, the STEVOR proteins were identified on the
surface of non-permeabilized/non-fixed merozoites in flow cytometry assays.
Anti-PFL2610w antibody showed that several STEVORs were expressed in the
trophozoite stage of the parasite but only one variant was integrated into the
merozoite membrane. Moreover, this antibody failed to identify STEVORs on the
surface of the parent schizont infected erythrocytes (IE) although they were
readily identified when schizont IE were permeabilized.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest for a role for STEVOR in immune evasion by P.
falciparum merozoites to allow successful invasion of erythrocytes. Additionally,
the expression of STEVORs in the schizont stage may only represent a step in the 
biogenesis process of the merozoite surface coat.
