Retortamonas spp. has been reported as an intestinal parasite among various host 
organisms, including humans; however, its intra-genus molecular diversity has not
yet been elucidated. Haplotypes of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA locus
(1836-1899 bp) of Retortamonas spp. from humans (n = 8), pigs (n = 6), dogs
(n = 1), goats (n = 16), water buffalos (n = 23), cattle (n = 7), rats (n = 3),
and chickens (n = 5) were analyzed with references isolated from non-human
mammals, amphibians, and insects. Phylogenetic and network analyses revealed a
statistically supported three cluster formation among the vertebrate-isolated
haplotypes, while insect-isolated haplotypes were independently clustered with
Chilomastix. In the clade of vertebrate isolates, assemblage A (amphibian
genotype), which included the amphibian references, was addressed as an out-group
of the other clusters. Assemblage B (mammalian and chicken genotype) included
most haplotypes from various mammals including humans with the haplotypes
isolated from a chicken. Human isolates were all classified into this assemblage,
thus assemblage B might correspond to R. intestinalis. Assemblage C (bovine
genotype), which included specific haplotypes from water buffalos and cattle, was
addressed as a sister lineage of assemblage B. Among the diversified haplotypes
of assemblage B, a specific haplotype, which was identified from multiple host
mammals (humans, dogs, pigs, cattle, water buffalos, elks, goats, and rats),
indicates the potential zoonotic transmission of the Retortamonas among them. The
genotyping classification of retortamonads could contribute to a better
understanding of its molecular epidemiology, especially among humans and related 
host organisms.
