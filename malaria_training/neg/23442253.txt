BACKGROUND: The advent of next generation sequencing technology has accelerated
efforts to map and catalogue copy number variation (CNV) in genomes of important 
micro-organisms for public health. A typical analysis of the sequence data
involves mapping reads onto a reference genome, calculating the respective
coverage, and detecting regions with too-low or too-high coverage (deletions and 
amplifications, respectively). Current CNV detection methods rely on statistical 
assumptions (e.g., a Poisson model) that may not hold in general, or require
fine-tuning the underlying algorithms to detect known hits. We propose a new CNV 
detection methodology based on two Poisson hierarchical models, the Poisson-Gamma
and Poisson-Lognormal, with the advantage of being sufficiently flexible to
describe different data patterns, whilst robust against deviations from the often
assumed Poisson model.
RESULTS: Using sequence coverage data of 7 Plasmodium falciparum malaria genomes 
(3D7 reference strain, HB3, DD2, 7G8, GB4, OX005, and OX006), we showed that
empirical coverage distributions are intrinsically asymmetric and overdispersed
in relation to the Poisson model. We also demonstrated a low baseline false
positive rate for the proposed methodology using 3D7 resequencing data and
simulation. When applied to the non-reference isolate data, our approach detected
known CNV hits, including an amplification of the PfMDR1 locus in DD2 and a large
deletion in the CLAG3.2 gene in GB4, and putative novel CNV regions. When
compared to the recently available FREEC and cn.MOPS approaches, our findings
were more concordant with putative hits from the highest quality array data for
the 7G8 and GB4 isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the proposed methodology brings an increase in
flexibility, robustness, accuracy and statistical rigour to CNV detection using
sequence coverage data.
