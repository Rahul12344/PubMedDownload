Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important signalling molecule across 
evolution, but until recently there was little information on its role in malaria
parasites. Advances in gene editing - in particular conditional genetic
approaches and mass spectrometry have paved the way for characterisation of the
key components of the cAMP signalling pathway in malaria parasites. This has
revealed that cAMP signalling plays a critical role in invasion of host red blood
cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites through regulating the phosphorylation 
of key parasite proteins by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These
insights will help us to investigate parasite cAMP signalling as a target for
novel antimalarial drugs.
