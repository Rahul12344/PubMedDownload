BACKGROUND: It is well established that infection by Plasmodium vivax is a result
of host-parasite interactions. In the present study, association with the IL1/IL2
cytokine profiles, anticircumsporozoite protein antibody levels and parasitic
loads was evaluated in individuals naturally infected with P. vivax in an endemic
area of the Brazilian Amazon.
METHODS: Molecular diagnosis of P. vivax and variants was performed using the
PCR-RFLP method and IL1B -511C>T, IL2 -330T>G and IL2+114T>G polymorphisms were
identified using PCR-RFLP and allele-specific PCR. IL-1β and IL-2 cytokine levels
were detected by flow cytometry and circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibodies
were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: Three variants of P. vivax CSP were identified and VK247 was found to be
the most frequent. However, the prevalence and magnitude of IgG antibodies were
higher for the VK210 variant. Furthermore, the antibody response to the CSP
variants was not associated with the presence of the variant in the infection.
Significant differences were observed between the single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) -511T>C in the IL1B gene and levels of antibodies to the VK247 and P.
vivax-like variants, but there were no associations between SNPs in IL1 and IL2
genes and their plasma products.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the rs16944 CC genotype in the IL1β gene have
higher antibody levels to the CSP of P. vivax of VK247 and P. vivax-like
variants.
