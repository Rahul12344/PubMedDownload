Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) account for more than two-thirds of
malaria diagnoses in Africa. Deletions of the Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 (pfhrp2)
gene cause false-negative RDT results and have never been investigated on a
national level. Spread of pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum mutants, resistant to
detection by HRP2-based RDTs, would represent a serious threat to malaria
elimination efforts.
Methods: Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of 7,137
children under five years of age from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we 
tested 783 subjects with RDT-/PCR+ results using PCR assays to detect and confirm
deletions of the pfhrp2 gene. Spatial and population genetic analyses were
employed to examine the distribution and evolution of these parasites.
Results: We identified 149 pfhrp2-deleted parasites, representing 6.4% of all P. 
falciparum infections country-wide (95% confidence interval 5.1-8.0%). Bayesian
spatial analyses identified statistically significant clustering of pfhrp2
deletions near Kinshasa and Kivu. Population genetic analysis revealed
significant genetic differentiation between wild-type and pfhrp2-deleted parasite
populations (GST = .046, p ≤ .00001).
Conclusions: Pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum is a common cause of RDT-/PCR+ malaria 
among asymptomatic children in the DRC and appears to be clustered within select 
communities. Surveillance for these deletions is needed, and alternatives to
HRP2-specific RDTs may be necessary.
