Whole-sporozoite vaccines engender sterilizing immunity against malaria in animal
models and importantly, in humans. Gene editing allows for the removal of
specific parasite genes, enabling generation of genetically attenuated parasite
(GAP) strains for vaccination. Using rodent malaria parasites, we have previously
shown that late liver stage-arresting replication-competent (LARC) GAPs confer
superior protection when compared with early liver stage-arresting
replication-deficient GAPs and radiation-attenuated sporozoites. However,
generating a LARC GAP in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P.
falciparum) has been challenging. Here, we report the generation and
characterization of a likely unprecedented P. falciparum LARC GAP generated by
targeted gene deletion of the Mei2 gene: P. falciparum mei2-. Robust
exoerythrocytic schizogony with extensive cell growth and DNA replication was
observed for P. falciparum mei2- liver stages in human liver-chimeric mice.
However, P. falciparum mei2- liver stages failed to complete development and did 
not form infectious exoerythrocytic merozoites, thereby preventing their
transition to asexual blood stage infection. Therefore, P. falciparum mei2- is a 
replication-competent, attenuated human malaria parasite strain with potentially 
increased potency, useful for vaccination to protect against P. falciparum
malaria infection.
