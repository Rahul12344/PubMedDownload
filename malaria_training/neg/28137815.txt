The spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum compromises the
therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) and is
considered the greatest threat to current global initiatives to control and
eliminate malaria. This is particularly relevant in Vietnam, where
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is the recommended ACT for P. falciparum
infection. The propeller domain gene of K13, a molecular marker of artemisinin
resistance, was successfully sequenced in 1,060 P. falciparum isolates collected 
at 3 malaria hot spots in Vietnam between 2009 and 2016. Eight K13 propeller
mutations (Thr474Ile, Tyr493His, Arg539Thr, Ile543Thr, Pro553Leu, Val568Gly,
Pro574Leu, and Cys580Tyr), including several that have been validated to be
artemisinin resistance markers, were found. The prevalences of K13 mutations were
29% (222/767), 6% (11/188), and 43% (45/105) in the Binh Phuoc, Ninh Thuan, and
Gia Lai Provinces of Vietnam, respectively. Cys580Tyr became the dominant
genotype in recent years, with 79.1% (34/43) of isolates in Binh Phuoc Province
and 63% (17/27) of isolates in Gia Lai Province carrying this mutation. K13
mutations were associated with reduced ring-stage susceptibility to
dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in vitro and prolonged parasite clearance in vivo An
analysis of haplotypes flanking K13 suggested the presence of multiple strains
with the Cys580Tyr mutation rather than a single strain expanding across the
three sites.
