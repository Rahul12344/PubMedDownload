The evolution of genetic mechanisms for host immune evasion and anti-malarial
resistance has enabled the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite to inflict high
morbidity and mortality on human populations. Most studies of P. falciparum
genetic diversity have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
assisting the identification of drug resistance-associated loci such as the
chloroquine related crt and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine related dhfr. Whilst larger
structural variants are known to impact adaptation, for example, mdr1
duplications with anti-malarial resistance, no large-scale, genome-wide study on 
clinical isolates has been undertaken using whole genome sequencing data. By
applying a structural variant detection pipeline across whole genome sequence
data from 2,855 clinical isolates in 21 malaria-endemic countries, we identified 
>70,000 specific deletions and >600 duplications. Most structural variants are
rare (48.5% of deletions and 94.7% of duplications are found in single isolates) 
with 2.4% of deletions and 0.2% of duplications found in >5% of global isolates. 
A subset of variants was present at high frequency in drug-resistance related
genes including mdr1, the gch1 promoter region, and a putative novel duplication 
of crt. Regional-specific variants were identified, and a companion visualisation
tool has been developed to assist web-based investigation of these polymorphisms 
by the wider scientific community.
