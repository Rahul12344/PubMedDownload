Identification of an exported heat shock protein 70 in Plasmodium falciparum.

Host cell remodelling is a hallmark of malaria pathogenesis. It involves protein 
folding, unfolding and trafficking events and thus participation of chaperones
such as Hsp70s and Hsp40s is well speculated. Until recently, only Hsp40s were
thought to be the sole representative of the parasite chaperones in the
exportome. However, based on the re-annotated Plasmodium falciparum genome
sequence, a putative candidate for exported Hsp70 has been reported, which
otherwise was known to be a pseudogene. We raised a specific antiserum against a 
C-terminal peptide uniquely present in PfHsp70-x. Immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence-based approaches in combination with sub-cellular
fractionation by saponin and streptolysin-O have been taken to determine the
expression and localization of PfHsp70-x in infected erythrocyte. The
re-annotated sequence of PfHsp70-x reveals it to be a functional protein with an 
endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide. It gets maximally expressed at the schizont
stage of intra-erythrocytic life cycle. Majority of the protein localizes to the 
parasitophorous vacuole and some of it gets exported to the erythrocyte
compartment where it associates with Maurer's clefts. The identification of an
exported parasite Hsp70 chaperone presents us with the fact that the parasite has
evolved customized chaperones which might be playing crucial roles in aspects of 
trafficking and host cell remodelling.
