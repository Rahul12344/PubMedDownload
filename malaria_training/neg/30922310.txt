BACKGROUND: The persistence of malaria in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa has
motivated the development of novel tools to complement existing control
programmes, including gene-drive technologies to modify mosquito vector
populations. Here, we use a stochastic simulation model to explore the potential 
of using a driving-Y chromosome to suppress vector populations in a 106 km2 area 
of West Africa including all of Burkina Faso.
RESULTS: The consequence of driving-Y introductions is predicted to vary across
the landscape, causing elimination of the target species in some regions and
suppression in others. We explore how this variation is determined by
environmental conditions, mosquito behaviour, and the properties of the
gene-drive. Seasonality is particularly important, and we find population
elimination is more likely in regions with mild dry seasons whereas suppression
is more likely in regions with strong seasonality.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the spatial heterogeneity, we suggest that repeated
introductions of modified mosquitoes over a few years into a small fraction of
human settlements may be sufficient to substantially reduce the overall number of
mosquitoes across the entire geographic area.
