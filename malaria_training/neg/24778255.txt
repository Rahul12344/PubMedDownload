Mosquito salivary glands have important roles in blood feeding and pathogen
transmission. However, the biological relevance of many salivary components has
yet to be determined. Aegyptin, a secreted salivary protein from Aedes aegypti,
binds collagen and inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion. We used a
transgenic approach to study the relevance of Aegyptin in mosquito blood feeding.
Aedes aegypti manipulated genetically to express gene-specific inverted-repeat
RNA sequences exhibited significant reductions in Aegyptin mRNA accumulation
(85-87%) and protein levels (>80-fold) in female mosquito salivary glands.
Transgenic mosquitoes had longer probing times (78-300 s, P < 0.0001) when
feeding on mice compared with controls (15-56 s), feeding success was reduced,
and those feeding took smaller blood meals. However, no differences in feeding
success or blood meal size were found in membrane feeding experiments using
defibrinated human blood. Salivary gland extracts from transgenic mosquitoes
failed to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. Reductions of
Aegyptin did not affect salivary ADP-induced platelet aggregation inhibition or
disturb anticlotting activities. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
Aegyptin for A. aegypti blood feeding, providing further support for the
hypothesis that platelet aggregation inhibition is a vital salivary function in
blood feeding arthropods. It has been suggested that the multiple mosquito
salivary components mediating platelet aggregation (i.e., Aegyptin, apyrase, D7) 
represent functional redundancy. Our findings do not support this hypothesis;
instead, they indicate that multiple salivary components work synergistically and
are necessary to achieve maximum blood feeding efficiency.
