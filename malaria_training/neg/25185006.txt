Plasmodium falciparum originated in Africa, dispersed around the world as a
result of human migration and had to adapt to several different indigenous
anopheline mosquitoes. Anophelines from the New World are evolutionary distant
form African ones and this probably resulted in a more stringent selection of
Plasmodium as it adapted to these vectors. It is thought that Plasmodium has been
genetically selected by some anopheline species through unknown mechanisms. The
mosquito immune system can greatly limit infection and P. falciparum evolved a
strategy to evade these responses, at least in part mediated by Pfs47, a highly
polymorphic gene. We propose that adaptation of P. falciparum to new vectors may 
require evasion of their immune system. Parasites with a Pfs47 haplotype
compatible with the indigenous mosquito vector would be able to survive and be
transmitted. The mosquito antiplasmodial response could be an important
determinant of P. falciparum population structure and could affect malaria
transmission in the Americas.
