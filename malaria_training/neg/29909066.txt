The ribosomal RNA adenine dimethyltransferases (rAD) of KsgA/Dim1 family are
universally conserved with eukaryotic rADs separated into distinct cytosolic Dim1
and organellar KsgA/TFB homologs. Among the two putative KsgA proteins encoded by
the Plasmodium falciparum genome, we found that PfKsgA1 was dually localised in
the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion. The protein interacted specifically with
small ribosomal subunit as detected by ribosome pull-down using anti-PfKsgA1
antibodies. Recombinant PfKsgA1 exhibited methyltransferase activity which was
further confirmed by complementation in an Escherichia coli KsgA knockout strain.
Similar to the human mitochondrial KsgA homologs that can additionally function
as transcription regulators, PfKsgA1 also interacted with DNA in a sequence
non-specific manner suggesting more than one functional role of an important
ribosome biogenesis protein in Plasmodium.
