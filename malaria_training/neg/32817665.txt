BACKGROUND: Current malaria control and elimination strategies rely mainly on
efficacious antimalarial drugs. However, drug resistance is a major threat facing
malaria control programs. Determination of drug resistance molecular markers is
useful in the monitoring and surveillance of malaria drug efficacy. This study
aimed to determine the mutations and haplotypes frequencies of different genes
linked with antimalarial drug resistance in certain areas in Sudan.
METHODS: A total of 226 dried blood spots (DBS) of microscopically diagnosed P.
falciparum isolates were collected from Khartoum and three other areas in Sudan
during 2015-2017. Plasmodium falciparum confirmation and multiplicity of
infection was assessed using the Sanger's 101 SNPs-barcode and speciation was
confirmed using regions of the parasite mitochondria. Molecular genotyping of
drug resistance genes (Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, exonuclease, Pfk13,
parasite genetic background (PGB) (Pfarps10, ferredoxin, Pfcrt, Pfmdr2)) was also
performed. All genotypes were generated by selective regions amplicon sequencing 
of the parasite genome using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the Wellcome Sanger
Institute, UK then genotypes were translated into drug resistance haplotypes and 
species determination.
FINDINGS: In total 225 samples were confirmed to be P. falciparum. A higher
proportion of multiplicity of infection was observed in Gezira (P<0.001) based on
the Sanger 101 SNPs -barcode. The overall frequency of mutant haplotype Pfcrt
72-76 CVIET was 71.8%. For Pfmdr1, N86Y was detected in 53.6%, Y184F was observed
in 88.1% and D1246Y was detected in 1.5% of the samples. The most frequently
observed haplotype was YFD 47.4%. For Pfdhfr (codons 51, 59,108,164), the ICNI
haplotype was the most frequent (80.7%) while for Pfdhps (codons 436, 437, 540,
581, 613) the (SGEAA) was most frequent haplotype (41%). The Quadruple mutation
(dhfr N51I, S108N + dhps A437G, K540E) was the highest frequent combined mutation
(33.9%). In Pfkelch13 gene, 18 non-synonymous mutations were detected, 7 of them 
were detected in other African countries. The most frequent Pfk13 mutation was
E433D detected in four samples. All of the Pfk13 mutant alleles have not been
reported to belong to mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in
Southeast Asia. PGB mutations were detected only in Pfcrt N326S\I (46.3%) and
Pfcrt I356T (8.2%). The exonuclease mutation was not detected. There was no
significant variation in mutant haplotypes between study areas.
CONCLUSIONS: There was high frequency of mutations in Pfcrt, Pfdhfr and Pfdhps in
this study. These mutations are associated with chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance. Many SNPs in Pfk13 not linked with
delayed parasite clearance were observed. The exonuclease E415G mutation which is
linked with piperaquine resistance was not reported.
