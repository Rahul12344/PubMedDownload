BACKGROUND: Anopheles stephensi is considered an important malaria vector in
Iran, Asia, and recently in the Horn of Africa. Recently, Ansteobp1 intron I
sequence has been introduced a new molecular marker for identification of its
biological forms including, mysorensis, intermediate and type, using insectary
colony specimens.
METHODS: In the current study, new marker ability in molecular identification of 
biological forms has been evaluated with An. stephensi specimens collected from
Iran and Afghanistan malarious provinces. Following DNA extraction and PCR
amplification, sequence analysis and constructed phylogenetic tree revealed that 
type and intermediate forms are distributed in Iran.
RESULTS: The specimens collected from Afghanistan identified as intermediate and 
mysorensis forms. Therefore, intermediate form is sympatric species in both
countries. Based on the results of Ansteobp1 intron I sequences, An. stephensi
could be suggested as new Anopheles complex species including An. stephensi
sibling A (type form), An. stephensi sibling B (intermediate form) and An.
stephensi sibling C (mysorensis form). This is the first report on the presence
of An. stephensi biological forms in Afghanistan.
CONCLUSIONS: Iran is going to eliminate malaria transmission from the country,
precise species identification, especially in complex species will be helpful in 
the prevention of malaria resurgence in the country, mainly because of common
fauna of Anopheles species and through border malaria and population movement
within Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
