In Malaŵi, Malungo alibe odi is a saying that translates as: 'Malaria does not
ask permission before coming in'. The recent finding of a new severe malaria
resistance locus next to a cluster of glycophorin genes involved in Plasmodium
falciparum erythrocyte invasion seems to suggest otherwise: that evolutionary
pressure is enabling erythrocytes to lock the door to keep malaria out.
