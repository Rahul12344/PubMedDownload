BACKGROUND: The horn fly (Haematobia irritans) is an obligate blood feeder that
causes considerable economic losses in livestock industries worldwide. The
control of this cattle pest is mainly based on insecticides; unfortunately, in
many regions, horn flies have developed resistance. Vaccines or biological
control have been proposed as alternative control methods, but the available
information about the biology or physiology of this parasite is rather scarce.
RESULTS: We present a comprehensive description of the salivary and midgut
transcriptomes of the horn fly (Haematobia irritans), using deep sequencing
achieved by the Illumina protocol, as well as exploring the virome of this fly.
Comparison of the two transcriptomes allow for identification of uniquely
salivary or uniquely midgut transcripts, as identified by statistically
differential transcript expression at a level of 16 x or more. In addition, we
provide genomic highlights and phylogenetic insights of Haematobia irritans Nora 
virus and present evidence of a novel densovirus, both associated to midgut
libraries of H. irritans.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of protein sequences associated with the
salivary glands and midgut of the horn fly that will be useful for vaccine
design. Additionally, we discover two midgut-associated viruses that infect these
flies in nature. Future studies should address the prevalence, biological effects
and life cycles of these viruses, which could eventually lead to translational
work oriented to the control of this economically important cattle pest.
