Malaria is induced by infection with Plasmodium parasites, which are genetically 
diverse, and the immune response to Plasmodium infection has both allele-specific
and cross-reactive components. To determine the role of the cross-reactive immune
response in the protection and disease manifestation in heterologous Plasmodium
infection, we used infection models of P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) and P. berghei 
ANKA (PbA). CD4+ T cells primed with Pcc infection exhibited strong
cross-reactivity to PbA antigens. We infected C57BL/6 mice with Pcc and
subsequently treated them with an anti-Plasmodium drug. The Pcc-primed mice
exhibited reduced parasitemia and showed no signs of experimental cerebral
malaria after infection with PbA. CD4+ T cells from the Pcc-primed mice produced 
high levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 in response to PbA early after PbA infection. The 
blockade of IL-10 signaling with anti-IL-10 receptor antibody increased the
proportion of activated CD4+ and γδ T cells and the IFN-γ production by CD4+ T
cells in response to PbA antigens, while markedly reducing the levels of
parasitemia. In contrast, IL-10 blockade did not have a significant effect on
parasitemia levels in unprimed mice after PbA infection. These data suggest a
potent regulatory role of IL-10 in the cross-reactive memory response to the
infection with heterologous Plasmodium parasites leading to the inhibition of the
protective immunity and pathogenesis.
