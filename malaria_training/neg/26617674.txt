BACKGROUND: Specific genomic loci, termed Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters, 
manufacture piRNAs that serve as guides for the inactivation of complementary
transposable elements (TEs). The piRNA pathway has been accurately detailed in
Drosophila melanogaster, while it remains poorly examined in other insects. This 
pathway is increasingly recognized as critical for germline development and
reproduction. Understanding of the piRNA functions in mosquitoes could offer an
opportunity for disease vector control by the reduction of their reproductive
potential.
RESULTS: To analyze the similarities and differences in this pathway between
Drosophila and mosquito, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genomic loci
producing piRNAs and their targets in the African malaria vector Anopheles
gambiae. We identified 187 piRNA clusters in the An. gambiae genome and 155 piRNA
clusters in the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate that many more piRNA
clusters in the mosquito compared with the fruit fly are uni-directionally
transcribed and are located outside pericentromeric heterochromatin. About 11 %
of the An. gambiae piRNA population map to gene transcripts. This is a noticeable
increase compared with the ~6 % of the piRNA population mapped to genes in D.
melanogaster. A subset of the piRNA-enriched genes in An. gambiae has functions
related to reproduction and development. At least 24 and 65 % of the mapped
piRNAs correspond to genomic TE sequences in An. gambiae and D. melanogaster,
respectively. DNA transposons and non-LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in
An. gambiae, while LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in D. melanogaster.
Yet, piRNAs predominantly target LTR retrotransposons in both species, which may 
point to a distinct feature of these elements compared to the other classes of
TEs concerning their silencing by the piRNA pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate that piRNA-producing loci have more ubiquitous 
distribution in the An. gambiae genome than in the genome of D. melanogaster.
Also, protein-coding genes have an increased role in production of piRNAs in the 
germline of this mosquito. Genes involved in germline and embryonic development
of An. gambiae generate a substantial portion of piRNAs, suggesting a role of the
piRNA pathway in the epigenetic regulation of the reproductive processes in the
African malaria vector.
