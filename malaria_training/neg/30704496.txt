BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important disease in many tropical countries. Rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) are valuable tools for diagnosing malaria in remote
areas. The majority of RDTs used for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum are
based on the detection of the specific histidine-rich proteins (PfHRP2 and
PfHRP3). During the last decade, the threat posed by the lack of expression of
these antigens and the variability of the proteins on the diagnosis of malaria
has been widely discussed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic
diversity of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 of P. falciparum isolates collected in three
Central American countries.
METHODS: DNA samples were amplified and sequenced to assess the diversity of
nucleotides and amino acids. A search for known epitopes within the amino acid
sequence was carried out, and the sensitivity of the sequences was evaluated
according to a predictive model. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out
including homologous sequences from different regions of the world. Protein
structures were predicted in silico.
RESULTS: Five different patterns for PfHRP2 and one pattern for PfHRP3 were
identified. Isolates from Central America show a high level of genetic diversity 
in pfhrp2; however, the amino acid sequences seem to contain enough motifs to be 
detected by the RDTs currently available.
CONCLUSION: It is unlikely that the variability of the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes
has a significant impact on the ability of the RDTs to detect the PfHRP antigens 
in Central America.
