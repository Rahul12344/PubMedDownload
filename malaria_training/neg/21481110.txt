Thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) from Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax)
became one of the important vaccine candidates for malaria, because P. vivax TRAP
(PvTRAP) is responsible for the sporozoite-host interactions. PvTRAP
polymorphisms in the isolates from Republic of Korea (ROK) were analysed, setting
the valuable baseline data for the future vaccine developments and clinical
trials with PvTRAP, as a strong vaccine candidate. A total of 54 isolates were
collected in 2010. PvTRAP genes from above isolates were amplified and sequenced,
and the results were analysed and compared against Sal-1 strain. Sequencing
analysis of 1424-bp-size PvTRAP PCR products revealed one major allelic type with
six non-synonymous substitutions, where S81T, E95D, I121V and T127R substitutions
were found in region II, and K371N and A425E substitutions from region IV. The
ROK isolates revealed the limited sequence polymorphisms in PvTRAP in comparison 
with the reported isolates from other nations.
