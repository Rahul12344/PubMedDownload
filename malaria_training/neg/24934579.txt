Malaria and toxoplasmosis are infectious diseases caused by the apicomplexan
parasites Plasmodium and Toxoplasma gondii, respectively. These parasites have
developed an invasion mechanism involving the formation of a moving junction (MJ)
that anchors the parasite to the host cell and forms a ring through which the
parasite penetrates. The composition and the assembly of the MJ, and in
particular the presence of protein AMA1 and its interaction with protein RON2 at 
the MJ, have been the subject of intense controversy. Here, using reverse
genetics, we show that AMA1, a vaccine candidate, interacts with RON2 to maintain
the MJ structural integrity in T. gondii and is subsequently required for
parasite internalization. Moreover, we show that disruption of the AMA1 gene
results in upregulation of AMA1 and RON2 homologues that cooperate to support
residual invasion. Our study highlights a considerable complexity and molecular
plasticity in the architecture of the MJ.
