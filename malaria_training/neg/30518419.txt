BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) gene encodes for a leading
malaria vaccine candidate antigen. However, its extensive polymorphic nature
represents a major obstacle to the development of a protective vaccine.
Previously, a pilot study was carried out to explore the sequence variation of
the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment within P. knowlesi MSP-1 gene (PkMSP-142) based on
12 clinical samples; however, further study on an adequate sample size is vital
in estimating the genetic diversity of the parasite population.
METHODS: In the present study, we included a larger sample size of P. knowlesi
(83 samples) covering eight states of Malaysia to determine the genetic
polymorphism, natural selection and haplotype groups of the gene fragment coding 
PkMSP-142. The region flanking PkMSP-142 was amplified by PCR and directly
sequenced. Genetic diversity, haplotype diversity, population genetic
differentiation and natural selection were determined in order to study the
polymorphic characteristic of PkMSP-142.
RESULTS: A high level of genetic diversity (Hd = 0.970 ± 0.007; л = 0.01079 ±
0.00033) was observed among the 83 P. knowlesi samples, confirming the extensive 
genetic polymorphism exhibited among the P. knowlesi population found in
Malaysia. A total of 18 distinct haplotypes with 17 amino acid changes were
identified, whereby 15 were new haplotypes. High population differentiation
values were observed within samples from Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian
Borneo. The 42 kDa fragments of P. knowlesi from Malaysian Borneo were found to
be acting on balancing selection whilst purifying selection was suggested to act 
on isolates from Peninsular Malaysia. The separation of PkMSP-142 haplotypes into
two main groups based on geographical separation has further supported the
existence of two distinct P. knowlesi lineages.
CONCLUSIONS: A high level of genetic diversity was observed among PkMSP-142 in
Malaysia, whereby most of the polymorphisms were found within the 33 kDa region. 
Taken together, these data will be useful in order to understand the nature of P.
knowlesi population in Malaysia as well as the design and development of a
MSP-142 based knowlesi malaria vaccine.
