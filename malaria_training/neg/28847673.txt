Allelic diversity leading to multiple gene polymorphisms of vivax malaria
parasites has been shown to greatly contribute to antigenic variation and drug
resistance, increasing the potential for multiple-clone infections within the
host. Therefore, to identify multiple-clone infections and the predominant
haplotype of Plasmodium vivax in a South Korean population, P. vivax merozoite
surface protein-1 (PvMSP-1) was analyzed by pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing of 156
vivax malaria-infected samples yielded 97 (62.18%) output pyrograms showing two
main types of peak patterns of the dimorphic allele for threonine and alanine
(T1476A). Most of the samples evaluated (88.66%) carried multiple-clone
infections (wild- and mutant-types), whereas 11.34% of the same population
carried only the mutant-type (1476A). In addition, each allele showed a high
frequency of guanine (G) base substitution at both the first and third positions 
(86.07% and 81.13%, respectively) of the nucleotide combinations. Pyrosequencing 
of the PvMSP-1 42-kDa fragment revealed a heterogeneous parasite population, with
the mutant-type dominant compared to the wild-type. Understanding the genetic
diversity and multiple-clone infection rates may lead to improvements in vivax
malaria prevention and strategic control plans. Further studies are needed to
improve the efficacy of the pyrosequencing assay with large sample sizes and
additional nucleotide positions.
