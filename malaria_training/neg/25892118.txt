Malaria is caused by a unicellular protozoan pathogen of the genus Plasmodium.
Although genes represent monocistronic units that are expressed in a life cycle
stage-specific manner, post-transcriptional regulation via translational
repression of mRNA has been observed in parasite stages that transition from the 
vertebrate host to the Anopheles vector. An interesting new type of
post-transcriptional control was recently discovered in Plasmodium falciparum
stages that infect human erythrocytes. A subgroup of genes that were thought to
be transcriptionally silent are actually transcribed but degraded immediately by 
an RNase II that is recruited to these gene loci. This cryptic RNA is not
detectable in steady-state RNA but has been detected using nuclear run-on
techniques and in mutant RNase II parasites. Nascent RNA degradation controls
virulence genes expressed in a monoallelic fashion and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs),
but also a number of housekeeping-like of genes. More studies on other life cycle
stages may reveal the full extent of this type of gene regulation in malaria
parasites. It is tempting to speculate that RNase II-mediated gene control may
exist in other eukaryotic organisms.
