Thiamine is metabolized into an essential cofactor for several enzymes. Here we
show that oxythiamine, a thiamine analog, inhibits proliferation of the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum in vitro via a thiamine-related pathway and
significantly reduces parasite growth in a mouse malaria model. Overexpression of
thiamine pyrophosphokinase (the enzyme that converts thiamine into its active
form, thiamine pyrophosphate) hypersensitizes parasites to oxythiamine by up to
1,700-fold, consistent with oxythiamine being a substrate for thiamine
pyrophosphokinase and its conversion into an antimetabolite. We show that
parasites overexpressing the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are up to 15-fold more
resistant to oxythiamine, consistent with the antimetabolite inactivating
thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes. Our studies therefore validate thiamine
utilization as an antimalarial drug target and demonstrate that a single
antimalarial can simultaneously target several enzymes located within distinct
organelles.
