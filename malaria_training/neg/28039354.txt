We assessed Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance markers in parasites collected 
in 2012, 2013, and 2015 at 3 sites in Uganda. The prevalence and frequency of
parasites with mutations in putative transporters previously associated with
resistance to aminoquinolines, but increased sensitivity to lumefantrine (pfcrt
76T; pfmdr1 86Y and 1246Y), decreased markedly at all sites. Antifolate
resistance mutations were common, with apparent emergence of mutations (pfdhfr
164L; pfdhps 581G) associated with high-level resistance. K13 mutations linked to
artemisinin resistance were uncommon and did not increase over time. Changing
malaria treatment practices have been accompanied by profound changes in markers 
of resistance.
