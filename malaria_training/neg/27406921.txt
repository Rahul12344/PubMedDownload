BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Anopheles gambiae is the major mosquito vector for
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, where it survives in
stressful climates. Aquaporin water channels are expressed in all life forms,
where they provide environmental adaptation by conferring rapid trans-cellular
movement of water (classical aquaporins) or water plus glycerol
(aquaglyceroporins). Here, we report an aquaglyceroporin homolog in A. gambiae,
AgAQP3 (A. gambiae aquaglyceroporin 3).
RESULTS: Despite atypical pore-lining amino acids, AgAQP3 is permeated by water, 
glycerol and urea, and is not significantly inhibited by 1 mM HgCl2 . AgAQP3 is
expressed more heavily in male mosquitoes, yet adult female A. gambiae abundantly
express AgAQP3 in Malpighian tubules and gut where large amounts of fluid
exchange occur during blood meal digestion, water and nutrient absorption and
waste secretion. Reducing expression of AgAQP3 by RNA interference reduces median
mosquito survival at 39°C. After an infectious blood meal, mosquitoes with
depleted AgAQP3 expression exhibit fewer P. falciparum oocysts in the midgut
compared to control mosquitoes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies reveal critical contributions of AgAQP3 to A. gambiae
heat tolerance and P. falciparum development in vivo.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates that AgAQP3 may be a major factor explaining
why A. gambiae is an important malaria vector mosquito in sub-Saharan Africa, and
may be a potential target for novel malaria control strategies.
