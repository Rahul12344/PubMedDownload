Single-dose primaquine (PQ) clears mature gametocytes and reduces the
transmission of Plasmodium falciparum after artemisinin combination therapy.
Genetic variation in CYP2D6, the gene producing the drug-metabolizing enzyme
cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), influences plasma concentrations of PQ and its
metabolites and is associated with PQ treatment failure in Plasmodium vivax
malaria. Using blood and saliva samples of varying quantity and quality from 8
clinical trials across Africa (n = 1,076), we were able to genotype CYP2D6 for
774 samples (72%). We determined whether genetic variation in CYP2D6 has
implications for PQ efficacy in individuals with gametocytes at the time of PQ
administration (n = 554) and for safety in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD)-deficient individuals treated with PQ (n = 110). Individuals with a
genetically inferred CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizer status had a higher
gametocyte prevalence on day 7 or 10 after PQ than those with an
extensive/ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizer status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79 [95%
confidence interval {CI}, 1.10, 2.90]; P = 0.018). The mean minimum hemoglobin
concentrations during follow-up for G6PD-deficient individuals were 11.8 g/dl for
CYP2D6 extensive/ultrarapid metabolizers and 12.1 g/dl for CYP2D6
poor/intermediate metabolizers (P = 0. 803). CYP2D6 genetically inferred
metabolizer status was also not associated with anemia following PQ treatment
(P = 0.331). We conclude that CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizer status may be 
associated with prolonged gametocyte carriage after treatment with
single-low-dose PQ but not with treatment safety.
