BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi is an emerging threat 
in Eastern Malaysia. Despite demonstrated vector competency, it is unknown
whether human-to-human (H-H) transmission is occurring naturally. We sought
evidence of drug selection pressure from the antimalarial
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as a potential marker of H-H transmission.
METHODS: The P. knowlesi dihdyrofolate-reductase (pkdhfr) gene was sequenced from
449 P. knowlesi malaria cases from Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) and genotypes
evaluated for association with clinical and epidemiological factors. Homology
modelling using the pvdhfr template was used to assess the effect of pkdhfr
mutations on the pyrimethamine binding pocket.
RESULTS: Fourteen non-synonymous mutations were detected, with the most common
being at codon T91P (10.2%) and R34L (10.0%), resulting in 21 different
genotypes, including the wild-type, 14 single mutants, and six double mutants.
One third of the P. knowlesi infections were with pkdhfr mutants; 145 (32%)
patients had single mutants and 14 (3%) had double-mutants. In contrast, among
the 47 P. falciparum isolates sequenced, three pfdhfr genotypes were found, with 
the double mutant 108N+59R being fixed and the triple mutants 108N+59R+51I and
108N+59R+164L occurring with frequencies of 4% and 8%, respectively. Two
non-random spatio-temporal clusters were identified with pkdhfr genotypes. There 
was no association between pkdhfr mutations and hyperparasitaemia or malaria
severity, both hypothesized to be indicators of H-H transmission. The orthologous
loci associated with resistance in P. falciparum were not mutated in pkdhfr.
Subsequent homology modelling of pkdhfr revealed gene loci 13, 53, 120, and 173
as being critical for pyrimethamine binding, however, there were no mutations at 
these sites among the 449 P. knowlesi isolates.
CONCLUSION: Although moderate diversity was observed in pkdhfr in Sabah, there
was no evidence this reflected selective antifolate drug pressure in humans.
