Pathogens can release extracellular vesicles (EVs) for cell-cell communication
and host modulation. EVs from Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria
parasite species, can transfer drug resistance genes between parasites. EVs from 
late-stage parasite-infected RBC (iRBC-EVs) are immunostimulatory and affect
endothelial cell permeability, but little is known about EVs from early stage
iRBC. We detected the parasite virulence factor PfEMP1, which is responsible for 
iRBC adherence and a major contributor to disease severity, in EVs, only up to
12-hr post-RBC invasion. Furthermore, using PfEMP1 transport knockout parasites, 
we determined that EVs originated from inside the iRBC rather than the iRBC
surface. Proteomic analysis detected 101 parasite and 178 human proteins in
iRBC-EVs. Primary human monocytes stimulated with iRBC-EVs released low levels of
inflammatory cytokines and showed transcriptomic changes. Stimulation with
iRBC-EVs from PfEMP1 knockout parasites induced more gene expression changes and 
affected pathways involved in defence response, stress response, and response to 
cytokines, suggesting a novel function of PfEMP1 when present in EVs. We show for
the first time the presence of PfEMP1 in early stage P. falciparum iRBC-EVs and
the effects of these EVs on primary human monocytes, uncovering a new mechanism
of potential parasite pathogenesis and host interaction.
