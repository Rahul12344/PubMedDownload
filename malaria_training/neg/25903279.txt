BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been defined as mRNA-like
transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack significant protein-coding
potential, and many of them constitute scaffolds for ribonucleoprotein complexes 
with critical roles in epigenetic regulation. Various lncRNAs have been
implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure, transcriptional and
post-transcriptional gene regulation, and regulation of genomic stability in
mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. The purpose of this
study is to identify the lncRNA landscape in the malaria vector An. gambiae and
assess the evolutionary conservation of lncRNAs and their secondary structures
across the Anopheles genus.
RESULTS: Using deep RNA sequencing of multiple Anopheles gambiae life stages, we 
have identified 2,949 lncRNAs and more than 300 previously unannotated putative
protein-coding genes. The lncRNAs exhibit differential expression profiles across
life stages and adult genders. We find that across the genus Anopheles, lncRNAs
display much lower sequence conservation than protein-coding genes. Additionally,
we find that lncRNA secondary structure is highly conserved within the Gambiae
complex, but diverges rapidly across the rest of the genus Anopheles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers one of the first lncRNA secondary structure
analyses in vector insects. Our description of lncRNAs in An. gambiae offers the 
most comprehensive genome-wide insights to date into lncRNAs in this vector
mosquito, and defines a set of potential targets for the development of
vector-based interventions that may further curb the human malaria burden in
disease-endemic countries.
