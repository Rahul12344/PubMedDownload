Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that proliferate in the bloodstream.
During each replication cycle, some parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the
only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual
commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional
regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-dependent
silencing of ap2-g prevents sexual conversion in proliferating parasites. In this
study, we identified Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as an 
upstream activator of sexual commitment. We found that GDV1 targeted
heterochromatin and triggered HP1 eviction, thus derepressing ap2-g Expression of
GDV1 was responsive to environmental triggers of sexual conversion and controlled
via a gdv1 antisense RNA. Hence, GDV1 appears to act as an effector protein that 
induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.
