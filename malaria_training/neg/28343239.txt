Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) modulate disease progression of 
pathogens including HIV, malaria, and hepatitis C. Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques
are widely used as nonhuman primate models to study human pathogens, and so,
considerable effort has been put into characterizing their KIR genetics. However,
previous studies have relied on cDNA cloning and Sanger sequencing that lack the 
throughput of current sequencing platforms. In this study, we present a high
throughput, full-length allele discovery method utilizing Pacific Biosciences
circular consensus sequencing (CCS). We also describe a new approach to Macaque
Exome Sequencing (MES) and the development of the Rhexome1.0, an adapted target
capture reagent that includes macaque-specific capture probe sets. By using
sequence reads generated by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and MES to inform
primer design, we were able to increase the sensitivity of KIR allele discovery. 
We demonstrate this increased sensitivity by defining nine novel alleles within a
cohort of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), a geographically isolated
population with restricted KIR genetics that was thought to be completely
characterized. Finally, we describe an approach to genotyping KIRs directly from 
sequence reads generated using WGS/MES reads. The findings presented here expand 
our understanding of KIR genetics in MCM by associating new genes with all eight 
KIR haplotypes and demonstrating the existence of at least one KIR3DS gene
associated with every haplotype.
