BACKGROUND: The Southeast Asian deletion (--(SEA)) is the most commonly observed 
mutation among diverse α-thalassemia alleles in Southeast Asia and South China.
It is generally argued that mutation --(SEA), like other variants causing
hemoglobin disorders, is associated with protection against malaria that is
endemic in these regions. However, little evidence has been provided to support
this claim.
RESULTS: We first examined the genetic imprint of recent positive selection on
the --(SEA) allele and flanking sequences in the human α-globin cluster, covering
a genomic region spanning ~410 kb, by genotyping 28 SNPs in a Chinese population 
consisting of 76 --(SEA) heterozygotes and 138 normal individuals. The pattern of
linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the long-range haplotype test revealed a
signature of positive selection. The network of inferred haplotypes suggested a
single origin of the --(SEA) allele.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our data support the hypothesis that the --(SEA) allele has
been subjected to recent balancing selection, triggered by malaria.
