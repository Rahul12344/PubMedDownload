We investigated the biological significance of path lengths in 12 protein-protein
interaction (PPI) networks. We put forward three predictions, based on the idea
that biological complexity influences path lengths. First, at the network level, 
path lengths are generally longer in PPIs than in random networks. Second, this
pattern is more pronounced in more complex organisms. Third, within a PPI
network, path lengths of individual proteins are biologically significant. We
found that in 11 of the 12 species, average path lengths in PPI networks are
significantly longer than those in randomly rewired networks. The PPI network of 
the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, however, does not exhibit deviation
from rewired networks. Furthermore, eukaryotic PPIs exhibit significantly greater
deviation from randomly rewired networks than prokaryotic PPIs. Thus our study
highlights the potentially meaningful variation in path lengths of PPI networks. 
Moreover, node eccentricity, defined as the longest path from a protein to
others, is significantly correlated with the levels of gene expression and
dispensability in the yeast PPI network. We conclude that biological complexity
influences both global and local properties of path lengths in PPI networks.
Investigating variation of path lengths may provide new tools to analyze the
evolution of functional modules in biological systems.
