BACKGROUND: Despite extensive efforts to discover transcription factors and their
binding sites in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, only a few
transcription factor binding motifs have been experimentally validated to date.
As a consequence, gene regulation in P. falciparum is still poorly understood.
There is now evidence that the chromatin architecture plays an important role in 
transcriptional control in malaria.
RESULTS: We propose a methodology for discovering cis-regulatory elements that
uses for the first time exclusively dynamic chromatin remodeling data. Our method
employs nucleosome positioning data collected at seven time points during the
erythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum to discover putative DNA binding motifs and
their transcription factor binding sites along with their associated clusters of 
target genes. Our approach results in 129 putative binding motifs within the
promoter region of known genes. About 75% of those are novel, the remaining being
highly similar to experimentally validated binding motifs. About half of the
binding motifs reported show statistically significant enrichment in functional
gene sets and strong positional bias in the promoter region.
CONCLUSION: Experimental results establish the principle that dynamic chromatin
remodeling data can be used in lieu of gene expression data to discover binding
motifs and their transcription factor binding sites. Our approach can be applied 
using only dynamic nucleosome positioning data, independent from any knowledge of
gene function or expression.
