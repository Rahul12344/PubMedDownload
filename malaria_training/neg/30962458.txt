Metabolic resistance to insecticides is threatening malaria control in Africa.
However, the extent to which it impacts malaria transmission remains unclear.
Here, we investigated the association between a marker of glutathione
S-transferase mediated metabolic resistance and Plasmodium infection in field
population of Anopheles funestus s.s. in comparison to the A296S-RDL target site 
mutation. The 119F-GSTe2 resistant allele was present in southern (Obout) (56%)
and central (Mibellon) (25%) regions of Cameroon whereas the 296S-RDL resistant
allele was detected at 98.5% and 15% respectively. The whole mosquito Plasmodium 
and sporozoite infection rates were 57% and 14.8% respectively in Obout (n = 508)
and 19.7% and 5% in Mibellon (n = 360). No association was found between
L119F-GSTe2 genotypes and whole mosquito infection status. However, when
analyzing oocyst and sporozoite infection rates separately, the resistant
homozygote 119F/F genotype was significantly more associated with Plasmodium
infection in Obout than both heterozygote (OR = 2.5; P = 0.012) and homozygote
susceptible (L/L119) genotypes (OR = 2.10; P = 0.013). In contrast, homozygote
RDL susceptible mosquitoes (A/A296) were associated more frequently with
Plasmodium infection than other genotypes (OR = 4; P = 0.03). No additive
interaction was found between L119F and A296S. Sequencing of the GSTe2 gene
showed no association between the polymorphism of this gene and Plasmodium
infection. Glutathione S-transferase metabolic resistance is potentially
increasing the vectorial capacity of resistant An. funestus mosquitoes. This
could result in a possible exacerbation of malaria transmission in areas of high 
GSTe2-based metabolic resistance to insecticides.
