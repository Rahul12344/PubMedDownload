The aim of this study was to identify Plasmodium spp. in blood samples from
nonhuman primates (NHPs) in the state of Maranhão, using classical and
alternative techniques for examination of human malaria. A total of 161 blood
samples from NHPs were analyzed: 141 from captive animals at a Wildlife Screening
Center (CETAS) and 20 from free-living animals in a private reserve. The
techniques used were microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), Indirect
fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and molecular techniques (semi-nested PCR,
quantitative real-time PCR and LAMP). Two serological methods (dot-ELISA and
indirect ELISA) were also standardized with rhoptry protein-soluble antigen of P.
falciparum and P. berghei. Trophozoite forms of Plasmodium sp. were identified on
slides from five different animals. No samples were positive through RDT and
LAMP. Four samples were seropositive for P. malariae through IFAT. The samples
showed low reactivity to ELISA. Plasmodium sp. was detected in 34.16% (55/161) of
the samples using qPCR based on the 18S rRNA gene. After sequencing, two samples 
showed 100% identityl to P. malariae, one showed 97% identity to Plasmodium sp.
ZOOBH and one showed 99% identity to P. falciparum . PCR was shown to be the most
sensitive technique for diagnosing Plasmodium in NHP samples.
