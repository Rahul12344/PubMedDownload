One hundred and one imported falciparum malaria cases in Wuhan City were
confirmed by microscopy and Nest-PCR, and the blood samples were collected. The
Pf60.1 gene was amplified by PCR. Among 101 blood samples, three Pf60.1 fragments
[313 bp (56.5%, 52/92), 340 bp (37.0%, 34/92), 313 bp+340 bp (6.5%, 6/92)] were
amplified from 92 samples. Among 83 blood samples from patients returning from
Africa, 313 bp fragment were found in 46 samples (55.4%, 46/83), 340 bp fragment 
were found in 31 samples (37.1%, 31/83), and 7.2% (6/83) was mixed-fragment (313 
bp+340 bp). Among 9 samples from southeast Asia, 6 samples were with 313 bp
fragment and 3 samples with 340 bp fragment. The results indicated that the most 
common genotype was 313 bp-genotype, and there would be polyclonal P. falciparum 
infections.
