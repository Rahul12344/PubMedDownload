In recent years, various intervention strategies have reduced malaria morbidity
and mortality, but further improvements probably depend upon development of a
broadly protective vaccine. To better understand immune requirement for
protection, we examined liver-stage immunity after vaccination with irradiated
sporozoites, an effective though logistically difficult vaccine. We identified a 
population of memory CD8+ T cells that expressed the gene signature of
tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells and remained permanently within the liver,
where they patrolled the sinusoids. Exploring the requirements for liver Trm cell
induction, we showed that by combining dendritic cell-targeted priming with liver
inflammation and antigen recognition on hepatocytes, high frequencies of Trm
cells could be induced and these cells were essential for protection against
malaria sporozoite challenge. Our study highlights the immune potential of liver 
Trm cells and provides approaches for their selective transfer, expansion, or
depletion, which may be harnessed to control liver infections or autoimmunity.
