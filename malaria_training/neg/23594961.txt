Sterile immunity against live Plasmodium infection can be achieved by
immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. This protection is known to
be mediated in part by antigen-specific memory CD8(+) T cells, presumably those
residing in the liver. We characterized and compared the transcriptional profile 
of parasite-specific memory CD8(+) T cells residing in the liver and spleen after
immunization of mice with irradiated sporozoites. Microarray-based expression
analysis of these memory CD8(+) T cells indicated that liver-resident memory
cells display a distinct gene expression profile. We found major differences in
the expression of immune function genes as well as genes involved in the cell
cycle, cell trafficking, transcription and intracellular signaling. Importantly, 
the malaria parasite-induced liver-resident CD8(+) T cells display a
transcriptional profile different to that described for CD8(+) T cells following 
other microbial challenges.
