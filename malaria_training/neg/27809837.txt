BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin emerged in the
Greater Mekong Sub-region has been associated with mutations in the propeller
domain of the kelch gene Pfk13.
METHODS: Here the polymorphisms in Pvk12 gene, the orthologue of Pfk13 in
Plasmodium vivax, were determined by PCR and sequencing in 262 clinical isolates 
collected in recent years (2012-2015) from the China-Myanmar border area.
RESULTS: Sequencing of full-length Pvk12 genes from these isolates identified
three synonymous mutations (N172N, S360S, S697S) and one non-synonymous mutation 
M124I, all of which were at very low prevalence (2.0-3.1%). Moreover, these
mutations were non-overlapping between the two study sites on both sides of the
border. Molecular evolutionary analysis detected signature of purifying selection
on Pvk12.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no direct evidence that Pvk12 is involved in artemisinin
resistance in P. vivax, but it remains a potential candidate requiring further
investigation. Continuous monitoring of potential drug resistance in this
parasite is needed in order to facilitate the regional malaria elimination
campaign.
