Aim: The purpose of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers used for
clinical therapy and prognostic evaluation of high-risk gastrointestinal stromal 
tumors (GISTs).
Materials and Methods: In this study, microarray data GSE31802 were used to
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high-risk GISTs and
low-risk GISTs. Then, enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted based on the gene
ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database. In
addition, the transcription factors and cancer-related genes in DEGs were
screened according to the TRANSFAC, TSGene, and TAG database. Finally,
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed to look
for critical genes involved in high-risk GISTs.
Results: A total of forty DEGs were obtained and these genes were mainly involved
in four pathways, including melanogenesis, neuroactive ligand-receptor
interaction, malaria, and hematopoietic cell lineage. The enriched biological
processes were related to the regulation of insulin secretion, integrin
activation, and neuropeptide signaling pathway. Transcription factor analysis of 
DEGs indicated that POU domain, class 2, associating factor 1 (POU2AF1) was
significantly downregulated in high-risk GISTs. By constructing the PPI network
of DEGs, ten genes with high degrees formed local networks, such as PNOC, P2RY14,
and SELP.
Conclusions: Four genes as POU2AF1, PNOC, P2RY14, and SELP might be used as
biomarkers for prognosis of high-risk GISTs.
