If they are able to spread in wild populations, CRISPR-based gene-drive elements 
would provide new ways to address ecological problems by altering the traits of
wild organisms, but the potential for uncontrolled spread tremendously
complicates ethical development and use. Here, we detail a self-exhausting form
of CRISPR-based drive system comprising genetic elements arranged in a daisy
chain such that each drives the next. "Daisy-drive" systems can locally duplicate
any effect achievable by using an equivalent self-propagating drive system, but
their capacity to spread is limited by the successive loss of nondriving elements
from one end of the chain. Releasing daisy-drive organisms constituting a small
fraction of the local wild population can drive a useful genetic element nearly
to local fixation for a wide range of fitness parameters without self-propagating
spread. We additionally report numerous highly active guide RNA sequences sharing
minimal homology that may enable evolutionarily stable daisy drive as well as
self-propagating CRISPR-based gene drive. Especially when combined with threshold
dependence, daisy drives could simplify decision-making and promote ethical use
by enabling local communities to decide whether, when, and how to alter local
ecosystems.
