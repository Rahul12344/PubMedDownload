The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, exports protein products to the infected
erythrocyte to introduce modifications necessary for the establishment of
nutrient acquisition and surface display of host interaction ligands. Erythrocyte
remodeling impacts parasite virulence and disease pathology and is well
documented for the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, but has been
less described for other Plasmodium species. For P. falciparum, the exported
protein skeleton-binding protein 1 (PfSBP1) is involved in the trafficking of
erythrocyte surface ligands and localized to membranous structures within the
infected erythrocyte, termed Maurer's clefts. In this study, we analyzed SBP1
orthologs across the Plasmodium genus by BLAST analysis and conserved gene
synteny, which were also recently described by de Niz et al. (2016). To evaluate 
the localization of an SBP1 ortholog, we utilized the zoonotic malaria parasite, 
Plasmodium knowlesi. Immunofluorescence assay of transgenic P. knowlesi parasites
expressing epitope-tagged recombinant PkSBP1 revealed a punctate staining pattern
reminiscent of Maurer's clefts, following infection of either monkey or human
erythrocytes. The recombinant PkSBP1-positive puncta co-localized with
Giemsa-stained structures, known as 'Sinton and Mulligan' stipplings.
Immunoelectron microscopy also showed that recombinant PkSBP1 localizes within or
on the membranous structures akin to the Maurer's clefts. The recombinant PkSBP1 
expressed in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes co-localized with PfSBP1 at the 
Maurer's clefts, indicating an analogous trafficking pattern. A member of the P. 
knowlesi 2TM protein family was also expressed and localized to membranous
structures in infected monkey erythrocytes. These results suggest that the
trafficking machinery and induced erythrocyte cellular structures of P. knowlesi 
are similar following infection of both monkey and human erythrocytes, and are
conserved with P. falciparum.
