SE36 antigen, derived from serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) of Plasmodium
falciparum, is a promising blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. Designated as
BK-SE36, the SE36 antigen was formulated with aluminum hydroxyl gel (AHG) and
produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) constraints. In a Phase Ib
clinical trial and follow-up study in Uganda, the risk for malaria symptoms was
reduced by 72% compared with the control group. Although promising, the number of
responders to the vaccine in 6-20years-olds was approximately 30% with the
majority in the younger cohort. This is in contrast to the phase Ia clinical
trial where response to the vaccine was 100% in Japanese malaria naive adults. A 
consideration that can be of importance is the involvement of host genetic
factors that may influence the ability to mount an effective immune response to
vaccination as well as susceptibility to malaria infection. We, therefore,
analyzed allelic polymorphism of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles using
sequence-based typing (SBT). In this study, DRB1 alleles did not influence
antibody response to BK-SE36 and the vaccinees susceptibility to clinical
malaria.
