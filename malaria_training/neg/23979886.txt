The malaria treatment recommended by the World Health Organization involves
medicines derived from artemisinin, an active compound extracted from the plant
Artemisia annua, and some of its derivatives, such as artesunate. Considering the
lack of data regarding the genotoxic effects of these compounds in human cells,
the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity,
and expressions of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes in a cultured human hepatocellular
liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cells) treated with artemisinin and artesunate. 
We tested concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 μg/mL of both substances with
a resazurin cytotoxicity assay, and the concentrations used in the genotoxicity
experiments (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL) and gene expression analysis (5 μg/mL) were
determined. The results of the comet assay in cells treated with artemisinin and 
artesunate showed a significant dose-dependent increase (P < 0.001) in the number
of cells with DNA damage at all concentrations tested. However, the gene
expression analysis revealed no significant change in expression of CASP3 or
SOD1. Our data showed that although artemisinin and artesunate exhibited
genotoxic effects in cultured HepG2 cells, they did not significantly alter
expression of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes at the doses tested.
