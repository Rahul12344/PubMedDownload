Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are becoming resistant to drugs
including antifolates, sulphonamides and chloroquine. This study was focused at
sequence analysis of resistant genes of these parasites against
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine, from Bannu, Pakistan. Known mutations
were detected at codons 57, 58 and 117 of pvdhfr gene of P. vivax, while none of 
the isolates had any pvdhps mutation. Similarly P. falciparum isolates exhibited 
double 59R+108N mutations in pfdhfr, and single 437G in pfdhps thus demonstrating
the existance of triple mutant 59R+108N+437G haplotype in this region. The key
chloroquine resistance mutation, 76T in pfcrt was observed in 100% of the P.
falciparum isolates, with haplotype SVMNT which is also associated with
resistance to amodiaquine. Some novel mutations were also observed in pvdhfr and 
pfdhfr genes.
