The introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy has led to
extraordinary results in malaria control, however the recent emergence of partial
resistance to artemisinin therapy in Southeast Asia jeopardizes these successes. 
This study aimed at investigating resistance to the antimalarial drugs by
evaluating the polymorphisms in the PfK13, Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes in Plasmodium
falciparum isolates obtained from patients in Eritrea.
