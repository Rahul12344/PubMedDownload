BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance is associated with delayed parasite clearance 
half-life in vivo and correlates with ring-stage survival under
dihydroartemisinin in vitro. Both phenotypes are associated with mutations in the
PF3D7_1343700 pfkelch13 gene. Recent spread of artemisinin resistance and
emerging piperaquine resistance in Southeast Asia show that artemisinin
combination therapy, such as dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, are losing clinical 
effectiveness, prompting investigation of drug resistance mechanisms and
development of strategies to surmount emerging anti-malarial resistance.
METHODS: Sixty-eight parasites isolates with in vivo clearance data were obtained
from two Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration study sites in
Cambodia, culture-adapted, and genotyped for pfkelch13 and other mutations
including pfmdr1 copy number; and the RSA0-3h survival rates and response to
antimalarial drugs in vitro were measured for 36 of these isolates.
RESULTS: Among these 36 parasites one isolate demonstrated increased ring-stage
survival for a PfKelch13 mutation (D584V, RSA0-3h = 8%), previously associated
with slow clearance but not yet tested in vitro. Several parasites exhibited
increased ring-stage survival, yet lack pfkelch13 mutations, and one isolate
showed evidence for piperaquine resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of 68 culture-adapted Plasmodium falciparum clinical
isolates from Cambodia with known clearance values, associated the D584V
PfKelch13 mutation with increased ring-stage survival and identified parasites
that lack pfkelch13 mutations yet exhibit increased ring-stage survival. These
data suggest mutations other than those found in pfkelch13 may be involved in
conferring artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum. Piperaquine resistance was
also detected among the same Cambodian samples, consistent with reports of
emerging piperaquine resistance in the field. These culture-adapted parasites
permit further investigation of mechanisms of both artemisinin and piperaquine
resistance and development of strategies to prevent or overcome anti-malarial
resistance.
