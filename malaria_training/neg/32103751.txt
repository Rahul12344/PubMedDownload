BACKGROUND: Mizoram, a northeastern state in India, shares international borders 
with Myanmar and Bangladesh and is considered to be one of the key routes through
which drug-resistant parasites of Southeast Asia enter mainland India. Despite
its strategic location and importance, malaria epidemiology and molecular status 
of chloroquine resistance had not been well documented, and since chloroquine
(CQ), as the first-line treatment in Plasmodium falciparum infection was
discontinued since 2008, it was expected that CQ-sensitive haplotype would be
more abundant.
METHODS: Malaria epidemiology data for the period 2010 to 2018 was collected from
the office of State Vector Disease Control Programme. Plasmodium
falciparum-positive blood samples were collected from government district
hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, sub-centres, and
diagnostic centres from six malaria-prone districts. The samples were processed
and analysed using genes-P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant transporter (pfcrt) 
and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) via sequencing of PCR amplicon 
from 2015 to 2017.
RESULTS: Malaria occurred throughout the year and P. falciparum accounted
for > 89% of total malaria cases. During 2010-2018, the highest number of malaria
incidence was recorded in Lawngtlai (36% of total malaria cases; average
API2010-2018 of 34.8) while Champhai remained consistently low (0.4%; average
API2010-2018 of 0.04). Males of ≥ 15 years old contributed maximum (35.7%) among 
gender and age malarial distribution recorded during 2014-2018. Death due to
malaria gradually decreased over the years. A higher abundance of mutated pfcrt
(58.5% of the total sample analysed) and a lower prevalence of mutated pfmdr1
(48.7%) were observed. All mutations identified for pfcrt belong to the Southeast
Asian CVIET haplotype. Only a single point mutation was observed at 86 (N → Y)
position in pfmdr1 (48.7%). The key N86Y mutation in pfmdr1 that had been shown
to modulate CQR was found in 67.1% of the samples positive for the CVIET
haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that details malaria epidemiology and also 
the molecular status of CQ-resistance in P. falciparum population of the region. 
The efforts of the State Vector Borne Disease Control Programme have proved to be
quite effective in controlling the malaria burden in the state. Despite the
discontinuation of CQ for a decade, local P. falciparum is observed with
decreased CQ-sensitive haplotype. It is believed that the present findings will
form a basis for further studies on genetic diversity in P. falciparum, which
could confer better understanding of the complexity of the disease in Southeast
Asia.
