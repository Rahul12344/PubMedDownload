BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections is important
because of the potentially fatal complications. SDFK90 is a recently marketed
malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) targeting both histidine-rich protein 2
(PfHRP2) and P. falciparum-specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH).
The present study evaluated its diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: SDFK90 was tested against a panel of stored whole blood samples (n= 591)
obtained from international travellers suspected of malaria, including the four
human Plasmodium species and Plasmodium negative samples. Microscopy was used as 
a reference method, corrected by PCR for species diagnosis. In addition, SDFK90
was challenged against 59 P. falciparum samples with parasite density ≥4% to
assess the prozone effect (no or weak visible line on initial testing and a
higher intensity upon 10-fold dilution).
RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for the detection of P. falciparum was 98.5% and
reached 99.3% at parasite densities >100/μl. There were significantly more PfHRP2
lines visible compared to Pf-pLDH (97.3% vs 86.9%), which was mainly absent at
parasite densities <100/μl. Specificity of SDFK90 was 98.8%. No lot-to-lot
variability was observed (p = 1.00) and test results were reproducible. A prozone
effect was seen for the PfHRP2 line in 14/59 (23.7%) P. falciparum samples
tested, but not for the Pf-pLDH line. Few minor shortcomings were observed in the
kit's packaging and information insert.
CONCLUSIONS: SDFK90 performed excellent for P. falciparum diagnosis. The
combination of PfHRP2 and Pf-pLDH ensures a low detection threshold and counters 
potential problems of PfHRP2 detection such as gene deletions and the prozone
effect.
