For reasons that remain unknown, the Plasmodium falciparum genome has an
exceptionally high AT content compared to other Plasmodium species and eukaryotes
in general - nearly 80% in coding regions and approaching 90% in non-coding
regions. Here, we examine how this phenomenon relates to genome-wide patterns of 
de novo mutation. Mutation accumulation experiments were performed by sequential 
cloning of six P. falciparum isolates growing in human erythrocytes in vitro for 
4 years, with 279 clones sampled for whole genome sequencing at different time
points. Genome sequence analysis of these samples revealed a significant excess
of G:C to A:T transitions compared to other types of nucleotide substitution,
which would naturally cause AT content to equilibrate close to the level seen
across the P. falciparum reference genome (80.6% AT). These data also uncover an 
extremely high rate of small indel mutation relative to other species, primarily 
associated with repetitive AT-rich sequences, in addition to larger-scale
structural rearrangements focused in antigen-coding var genes. In conclusion,
high AT content in P. falciparum is driven by a systematic mutational bias and
ultimately leads to an unusual level of microstructural plasticity, raising the
question of whether this contributes to adaptive evolution.
