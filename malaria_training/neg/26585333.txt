Phospholipid biosynthesis is critical for the development, differentiation and
pathogenesis of several eukaryotic pathogens. Genetic studies have validated the 
pathway for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis from phosphatidylserine catalyzed 
by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase enzymes (PSD) as a suitable target for
development of antimicrobials; however no inhibitors of this class of enzymes
have been discovered. We show that the Plasmodium falciparum PSD can restore the 
essential function of the yeast gene in strains requiring PSD for growth.
Genetic, biochemical and metabolic analyses demonstrate that amino acids between 
positions 40 and 70 of the parasite enzyme are critical for proenzyme processing 
and decarboxylase activity. We used the essential role of Plasmodium PSD in yeast
as a tool for screening a library of anti-malarials. One of these compounds is
7-chloro-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-quinolinamine, an inhibitor with potent activity
against P. falciparum, and low toxicity toward mammalian cells. We synthesized an
analog of this compound and showed that it inhibits PfPSD activity and eliminates
Plasmodium yoelii infection in mice. These results highlight the importance of
4-quinolinamines as a novel class of drugs targeting membrane biogenesis via
inhibition of PSD activity.
