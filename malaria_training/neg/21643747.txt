Regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is
tightly controlled and little is known about the many steps involved. One step
i.e. translation initiation is also poorly understood and in P. falciparum,
choice of the translation initiation site (TIS) is a critical decision largely
due to the high frequency of AUGs in the relatively long 5' untranslated regions 
of parasite mRNAs. The sequences surrounding the TIS have a major role to play in
translation initiation and this report evaluates these sequences by mutational
analysis of the heat shock protein 86 gene, transient transfection and reporter
assays in the parasite. We find that purines at the -3 and +4 positions are
essential for efficient translation in P. falciparum, similar to other
eukaryotes. Interestingly, a U at the -1 position results in 2.5-fold higher
reporter activity compared to wild type. Certain classes of protein biosynthetic 
genes show higher frequencies of U at the -1 position, suggesting that these
genes may exhibit higher levels of translation. This work defines the optimal
sequences for TIS choice and has implications for the design of efficient
expression vectors in an important human pathogen.
