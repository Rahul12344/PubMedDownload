Prior to infecting erythrocytes and causing malaria symptoms, Plasmodium
parasites undergo an obligatory phase of invasion and extensive replication
inside their mammalian host's liver cells that depends on the parasite's ability 
to obtain the nutrients it requires for its intra-hepatic growth and
multiplication. Here, we show that L-arginine (Arg) uptake through the host
cell's SLC7A2-encoded transporters is essential for the parasite's development
and maturation in the liver. Our data suggest that the Arg that is taken up is
primarily metabolized by the arginase pathway to produce the polyamines required 
for Plasmodium growth. Although the parasite may hijack the host's biosynthesis
pathway, it relies mainly upon its own arginase-AdoMetDC/ODC pathway to acquire
the polyamines it needs to develop. These results identify for the first time a
pivotal role for Arg-dependent polyamine production during Plasmodium's hepatic
development and pave the way to the exploitation of strategies to impact liver
infection by the malaria parasite through the modulation of Arg uptake and
polyamine synthesis.
