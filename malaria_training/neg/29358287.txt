Combinatorial chemotherapy is necessary for the treatment of malaria. However,
finding a suitable partner drug for a new candidate is challenging. Here we
develop an algorithm that identifies all of the gene pairs of Plasmodium
falciparum that possess orthologues in yeast that have a synthetic lethal
interaction but are absent in humans. This suggests new options for drug
combinations, particularly for inhibitors of targets such as P. falciparum
calcineurin, cation ATPase 4, or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase.
