BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are reported to be elevated in
populations of African descent living in affluent environments compared to
populations of European ancestry. However, the natural history of CRP levels in
populations of African descent living under adverse environments remains largely 
unknown.
METHODS: CRP levels were measured with a high sensitivity assay in 624 apparently
healthy individuals who contributed blood as part of a study on innate immune
responsiveness in a traditional Ghanaian population living under adverse
environmental conditions in a malaria endemic area. As a comparison, we included 
CRP measurements from 2931 apparently healthy individuals from the Dutch
population that were included in the same batch of CRP analyses. Associations
between CRP and body mass index (BMI), immune responsiveness, and P. falciparum
parasitaemia were investigated.
RESULTS: In an age- and sex-adjusted model, CRP levels were 0.54 mg/L lower in
the Ghanaian compared to the Dutch cohort (1.52 vs. 0.98 mg/L, p<0.001). When
accounting for the substantially higher average BMI in the Dutch compared to the 
Ghanaians (25.6 vs. 18.4 kg/m(2)) the difference in CRP levels disappeared. BMI
associated positively with CRP in the Dutch but not in the Ghanaians. In
individuals with an acute phase response, CRP levels were higher in the Ghanaian 
compared to the Dutch cohort (24.6 vs. 17.3 mg/L, p = 0.04). Levels of CRP were
positively related to immune responsiveness and P. falciparum parasitaemia (all
p<0.001) among Ghanaians.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that West-Africans do not exhibit an
inherently high inflammatory state. The role of genes, environment and
gene-environment interaction in explaining reports of elevated CRP levels in
populations of African ancestry when compared to other ethnicities living in
affluent environments thus merits further investigation.
