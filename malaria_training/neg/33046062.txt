BACKGROUND: Emergence of anti-malarial drug resistance and perpetual increase in 
malaria incidence necessitates the development of novel anti-malarials. Histone
deacetylases (HDAC) has been shown to be a promising target for malaria, despite 
this, there are no HDAC inhibitors in clinical trials for malaria treatment. This
can be attributed to the poor pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and selectivity
of the HDAC inhibitors.
METHODS: A collection of HDAC inhibitors were screened for anti-malarial
activity, and the best candidate was profiled in parasite-killing kinetics,
growth inhibition of sensitive and multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains and against
gametocytes. Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion pharmacokinetics 
(ADME-PK) parameters of FNDR-20123 were determined, and in vivo efficacy was
studied in a mouse model for Plasmodium falciparum infection.
RESULTS: A compound library of HDAC inhibitors (180 in number) was screened for
anti-malarial activity, of which FNDR-20123 was the most potent candidate. The
compound had been shown to inhibit Plasmodium HDAC with IC50 of 31 nM and human
HDAC with IC50 of 3 nM. The IC50 obtained for P. falciparum in asexual
blood-stage assay was 42 nM. When compared to atovaquone and pyrimethamine, the
killing profiles of FNDR-20123 were better than atovaquone and comparable to
pyrimethamine. The IC50 values for the growth inhibition of sensitive and MDR
strains were similar, indicating that there is no cross-resistance and a low risk
of resistance development. The selected compound was also active against
gametocytes, indicating a potential for transmission control: IC50 values being
190 nM for male and > 5 µM for female gametocytes. FNDR-20123 is a stable
candidate in human/mouse/rat liver microsomes (> 75% remaining post 2-h
incubation), exhibits low plasma protein binding (57% in humans) with no human
Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) liability (> 100 µM), and does not inhibit any 
of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms tested (IC50 > 25 µM). It also shows
negligible cytotoxicity to HepG-2 and THP-1 cell lines. The oral pharmacokinetics
in rats at 100 mg/kg body weight shows good exposures (Cmax = 1.1 µM) and
half-life (T1/2 = 5.5 h). Furthermore, a 14-day toxicokinetic study at 100 mg/kg 
daily dose did not show any abnormality in body weight or gross organ pathology. 
FNDR-20123 is also able to reduce parasitaemia significantly in a mouse model for
P. falciparum infection when dosed orally and subcutaneously.
CONCLUSION: FNDR-20123 may be a suitable candidate for the treatment of malaria, 
which can be further developed.
