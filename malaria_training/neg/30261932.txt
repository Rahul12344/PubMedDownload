BACKGROUND: Deforestation in the Amazon and the social vulnerability of its
settler communities has been associated with increased malaria incidence. The
feeding biology of the most important malaria vectors in the region, notably
Nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts to control vectors and reduce
transmission of what has become known as "Frontier Malaria". Exploring
Anophelinae mosquito diversity is fundamental to understanding the species
responsible for transmission and developing appropriate management and
intervention strategies for malaria control in the Amazon River basin.
METHODS: This study describes Anophelinae mosquito diversity from settler
communities affected by Frontier Malaria in the states of Acre, Amazonas and
Rondônia by analysing COI gene data using cluster and tree-based species
delimitation approaches.
RESULTS: In total, 270 specimens from collection sites were sequenced and these
were combined with 151 reference (GenBank) sequences in the analysis to assist in
species identification. Conservative estimates found that the number of species
collected at these sites was between 23 (mPTP partition) and 27 (strict ABGD
partition) species, up to 13 of which appeared to be new. Nyssorhynchus
triannulatus and Nyssorhynchus braziliensis displayed exceptional levels of
intraspecific genetic diversity but there was little to no support for putative
species complex status.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Anophelinae mosquito diversity
continues to be underestimated in poorly sampled areas where frontier malaria is 
a major public health concern. The findings will help shape future studies of
vector incrimination and transmission dynamics in these areas and support efforts
to develop more effective vector control and transmission reduction strategies in
settler communities in the Amazon River basin.
