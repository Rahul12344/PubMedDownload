The Ok(a) blood group antigen basigin (BSG or CD147) is an erythrocyte receptor
for the PfRh5 protein from Plasmodium falciparum. A recent study has shown that
the PfRh5-BSG interaction is essential for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum.
In this study, 6 SNPs in the BSG gene were investigated in 312 adult patients
with P. falciparum malaria (109 cerebral malaria and 203 mild malaria patients)
living in northwest Thailand. To examine the association between BSG SNPs and
cerebral malaria, the allele and haplotype frequencies were compared in cerebral 
and mild malaria patients. Nonsynonymous SNPs were not assessed in the
association analysis. The results showed that common BSG polymorphisms and
haplotypes were not significantly associated with cerebral malaria. In
conclusion, common SNPs in BSG do not influence the risk of cerebral malaria in
the Thai population.
