The Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites and the
causative agents of severe diseases in humans and animals. Although complete
genome sequences are available since many years and for several parasites, they
are replete with putative genes of unassigned function. Forward and reverse
genetic approaches are limited only to a few Apicomplexans that can either be
propagated in vitro or in a convenient animal model. This review will compare and
contrast the most recent strategies developed for the genetic manipulation of
Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii that have taken
advantage of the intrinsic features of their respective genomes. Efforts towards 
the improvement of the transfection efficiencies in malaria parasites, the
development of approaches to study essential genes and the elaboration of
high-throughput methods for the identification of gene function will be
discussed.
