BACKGROUND: There have been few investigations evaluating the burden of malaria
disease at district level in the Republic of Congo since the introduction of
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The main objective of this study 
was to document laboratory-confirmed cases of malaria using microscopy and/or
rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in children and pregnant women attending selected
health facilities in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, the two main cities of the
country. Secondly, P. falciparum genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection 
during the malaria transmission season of October 2011 to February 2012 in these 
areas were described.
METHODS: Three and one health facilities were selected in Brazzaville and
Pointe-Noire as sentinel sites for malaria surveillance. Children under 15 years 
of age and pregnant women were enrolled if study criteria were met and lab
technicians used RDT and/or microscopy to diagnose malaria. In order to determine
the multiplicity of infection, parasite DNA was extracted from RDT cassette and
msp2 P.falciparum genotyped.
RESULTS: Malaria prevalence among more than 3,000 children and 700 pregnant women
ranged from 8 to 29%, and 8 to 24% respectively depending on health center
locality. While health workers did not optimize use of RDTs, microscopy remained 
a reference diagnostic tool. Quality control of malaria diagnosis at the
reference laboratory showed acceptable health centre performances. P. falciparum 
genetic diversity determination using msp2 gene marker ranged from 9 to 20
alleles and remains stable while multiplicity of infection (mean of
1.7clone/infected individual) and parasite densities in clinical isolates were
lower than previously reported.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with a reduction of malaria
transmission in the two areas. This study raises the issue of targeted training
for health workers and sustained availability of RDTs in order to improve quality
of care through optimal use of RDTs.
