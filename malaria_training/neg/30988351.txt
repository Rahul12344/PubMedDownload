PfEMP1 is a family of adhesive proteins expressed on the surface of Plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs), where they mediate adhesion of IEs to a
range of host receptors. Efficient PfEMP1-dependent IE sequestration often
depends on soluble serum proteins, including IgM. Here, we report a comprehensive
investigation of which of the about 60 var gene-encoded PfEMP1 variants per
parasite genome can bind IgM via the Fc part of the antibody molecule, and which 
of the constituent domains of those PfEMP1 are involved. We erased the epigenetic
memory of var gene expression in three distinct P. falciparum clones, 3D7, HB3,
and IT4/FCR3 by promoter titration, and then isolated individual IEs binding IgM 
from malaria-unexposed individuals by fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting.
The var gene transcription profiles of sub-clones measured by real-time qPCR were
used to identify potential IgM-binding PfEMP1 variants. Recombinant DBL and CIDR 
domains corresponding to those variants were tested by ELISA and protein arrays
to confirm their IgM-binding capacity. Selected DBL domains were used to raise
specific rat anti-sera to select IEs with uniform expression of candidate PfEMP1 
proteins. Our data document that IgM-binding PfEMP1 proteins are common in each
of the three clones studied, and that the binding epitopes are mainly found in
DBLε and DBLζ domains near the C-terminus.
