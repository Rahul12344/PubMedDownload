The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is exposed, during its development, to
major changes of ionic composition in its surrounding medium. We demonstrate that
the P. falciparum serpentine-like receptor PfSR25 is a monovalent cation sensor
capable of modulating Ca2+ signaling in the parasites. Changing from high
(140 mM) to low (5.4 mM) KCl concentration triggers [Ca2+]cyt increase in
isolated parasites and this Ca2+ rise is blocked either by phospholipase C (PLC) 
inhibition or by depleting the parasite's internal Ca2+ pools. This response
persists even in the absence of free extracellular Ca2+ and cannot be elicited by
addition of Na+, Mg2+ or Ca2+. However, when the PfSR25 gene was deleted, no
effect on [Ca2+]cyt was observed in response to changing KCl concentration in the
knocked out (PfSR25 -) parasite. Finally, we also demonstrate that: i) PfSR25
plays a role in parasite volume regulation, as hyperosmotic stress induces a
significant decrease in parasite volume in wild type (wt), but not in PfSR25 -
parasites; ii) parasites lacking PfSR25 show decreased parasitemia and
metacaspase gene expression on exposure to the nitric oxide donor sodium
nitroprusside (SNP) and iii), compared to PfSR25 - parasites, wt parasites showed
a better survival in albumax-deprived condition.
