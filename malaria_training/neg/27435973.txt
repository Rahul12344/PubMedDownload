BACKGROUND: The immune response against Plasmodium vivax immunogenic epitopes is 
regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that determine antibody levels 
and class switching. Cytokine gene polymorphisms may be responsible for changes
in the humoral immune response against malaria. The aim of this study was to
evaluate whether polymorphisms in the TNFA, IFNG and IL10 genes would alter the
levels of anti-PvAMA1, PvDBP and -PvMSP-119 IgG antibodies in patients with vivax
malaria.
METHODS: Samples from 90 vivax malaria-infected and 51 uninfected subjects from
an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon were genotyped using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to identify
polymorphisms of the genes TNFA (-1031T > C, -308G > A, -238G > A), IFNG
(+874T > A) and IL10 (-819C > T, -592C > A). The levels of total IgG against
PvAMA1, PvDBP and PvMSP-119 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Associations between the polymorphisms and the antibody response
were assessed by means of logistic regression models.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the levels of IgG antibodies
against the PvAMA-1, PvDBP or PvMSP-119 proteins in relation to the studied
polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no associations were found among the evaluated genotypes
and alleles and anti-merozoite IgG class P. vivax antibody levels, this study
helps elucidate the immunogenic profile involved in the humoral immune response
in malaria.
