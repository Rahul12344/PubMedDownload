BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum sexual development plays a fundamental role in 
the transmission and spread of malaria. The ability to generate gametocytes can
be lost during culture in vitro, often associated with the loss of a subtelomeric
region of chromosome 9. Gametocytogenesis starts with erythrocyte invasion by a
sexually committed merozoite, but the first available specific marker of sexual
differentiation appears only from 24 h post invasion.
METHODS: Specific antibodies and gene fusions were produced to study the timing
of expression and the sub-cellular localization of the P. falciparum Gametocyte
EXported Protein-5 (PfGEXP5), encoded in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9.
Expression patterns were examined in wild-type parasites and in parasite lines
mutated in the Apetala2-G (AP2-G) transcription factor, governing a cascade of
early sexual stage specific genes.
RESULTS: PfGEXP5 is highly expressed in early sexual stages and it is actively
exported to the infected erythrocyte cytoplasm from as early as 14 h
post-invasion in haemozoin-free, ring stage-like parasites. The pattern of
PfGEXP5 expression and export is similar in wild-type parasites and in
independent AP2-G defective parasite lines unable to produce gametocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: PfGEXP5 represents the earliest post-invasion sexual stage marker
described to date. This provides a tool that can be used to identify sexually
committed ring stage parasites in natural infections. This early gametocyte
marker would enable the identification and mapping of malaria transmission
reservoirs in human populations and the study of gametocyte sequestration
dynamics in infected individuals. The fact that regulation of PfGEXP5 does not
depend on the AP2-G master regulator of parasite sexual development suggests
that, after sexual commitment, differentiation progresses through multiple
checkpoints in the early phase of gametocytogenesis.
