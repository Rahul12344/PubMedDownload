BACKGROUND: In 2006, the Senegalese National Malaria Control Programme
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with
artemether-lumefantrine as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria. To date, multiple mutations associated with artemisinin
delayed parasite clearance have been described in Southeast Asia in the Pfk13
gene, such as Y493H, R539T, I543T and C580Y. Even though ACT remains clinically
and parasitologically efficacious in Senegal, the spread of resistance is
possible as shown by the earlier emergence of resistance to chloroquine in
Southeast Asia that subsequently spread to Africa. Therefore, surveillance of
artemisinin resistance in malaria endemic regions is crucial and requires the
implementation of sensitive tools, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) which
can detect novel mutations at low frequency.
METHODS: Here, an amplicon sequencing approach was used to identify mutations in 
the Pfk13 gene in eighty-one P. falciparum isolates collected from three
different regions of Senegal.
RESULTS: In total, 10 SNPs around the propeller domain were identified; one
synonymous SNP and nine non-synonymous SNPs, and two insertions. Three of these
SNPs (T478T, A578S and V637I) were located in the propeller domain. A578S, is the
most frequent mutation observed in Africa, but has not previously been reported
in Senegal. A previous study has suggested that A578S could disrupt the function 
of the Pfk13 propeller region.
CONCLUSION: As the genetic basis of possible artemisinin resistance may be
distinct in Africa and Southeast Asia, further studies are necessary to assess
the new SNPs reported in this study.
