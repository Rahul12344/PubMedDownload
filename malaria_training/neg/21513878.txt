Pactamycin, one of the most densely functionalized aminocyclitol antibiotics, has
pronounced antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, and antiplasmodial activities,
but its development as a clinical drug was hampered by its broad cytotoxicity.
Efforts to modulate the biological activity by structural modifications using
synthetic organic chemistry have been difficult because of the complexity of its 
chemical structure. However, through extensive biosynthetic studies and genetic
engineering, we were able to produce analogs of pactamycin that show potent
antimalarial activity, but lack significant antibacterial activity, and are about
10-30 times less toxic than pactamycin toward mammalian cells. The results
suggest that distinct ribosomal binding selectivity or new mechanism(s) of action
may be involved in their plasmodial growth inhibition, which may lead to the
discovery of new antimalarial drugs and identification of new molecular targets
within malarial parasites.
