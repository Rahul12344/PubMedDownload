We explored and constructed haplotype network for simian malaria species:
Plasmodium knowlesi, P. cynomolgi and P. inui aiming to understand the
transmission dynamics between mosquitoes, humans and macaques. Mosquitoes were
collected from villages in an area where zoonotic malaria is prevalent. PCR
analysis confirmed Anopheles balabacensis as the main vector for macaque
parasites, moreover nearly 60% of the mosquitoes harboured more than one
Plasmodium species. Fragments of the A-type small subunit ribosomal RNA (SS rRNA)
amplified from salivary gland sporozoites, and equivalent sequences obtained from
GenBank were used to construct haplotype networks. The patterns were consistent
with the presence of geographically distinct populations for P. inui and P.
cynomolgi, and with three discrete P. knowlesi populations. This study provides a
preliminary snapshot of the structure of these populations, that was insufficient
to answer our aim. Thus, collection of parasites from their various hosts and
over time, associated with a systematic analysis of a set of genetical loci is
strongly advocated in order to obtain a clear picture of the parasite population 
and the flow between different hosts. This is important to devise measures that
will minimise the risk of transmission to humans, because zoonotic malaria
impedes malaria elimination.
