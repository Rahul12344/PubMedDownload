Introgressive hybridization is now recognized as a widespread phenomenon, but its
role in evolution remains contested. Here, we use newly available reference
genome assemblies to investigate phylogenetic relationships and introgression in 
a medically important group of Afrotropical mosquito sibling species. We have
identified the correct species branching order to resolve a contentious phylogeny
and show that lineages leading to the principal vectors of human malaria were
among the first to split. Pervasive autosomal introgression between these malaria
vectors means that only a small fraction of the genome, mainly on the X
chromosome, has not crossed species boundaries. Our results suggest that traits
enhancing vectorial capacity may be gained through interspecific gene flow,
including between nonsister species.
