Within the human host, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is exposed to
multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe
malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to-or is selected by-this 
environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause
severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined
subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of
protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene
expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria
in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with
severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without
activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably
transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface
expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone
proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity 
and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed
all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and
severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets
for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to-or are selected
by-the host environment in severe malaria.
