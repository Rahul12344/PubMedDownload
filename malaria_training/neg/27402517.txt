Mansonellosis is endemic in several regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin
America. Mansonella ozzardi and Mansonella perstans have been reported in Latin
America, including the Amazon region. A morphological and molecular microfilariae
study was performed in Pauini (Brazil). Blood samples were collected from 40
individuals, and were analyzed by Giemsa-stained blood film and by two different 
nested polymerase chain reactions which detect internal transcribed spacer-1 and 
the major sperm protein gene. By microscopy, 14 of 40 were positive: 11 as M.
ozzardi and three as M. perstans-like infections. Both molecular methods detected
19 positive cases as M. ozzardi, including those 14 individuals detected by
microscopy, without detectable genetic differences among any of the 19 positive
samples. Molecular techniques showed an improvement of mansonellosis diagnosis
and may become an effective tool to evaluate the present status of M. ozzardi and
M. perstans in Latin America.
