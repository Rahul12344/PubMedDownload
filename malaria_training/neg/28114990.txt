BACKGROUND: The impact of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) used as intermittent
preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) on mutant parasite selection has 
been poorly documented in Burkina Faso. This study sought first to explore the
relationship between IPTp-SP and the presence of mutant parasites. Second, to
assess the relationship between the mutant parasites and adverse pregnancy
outcomes.
METHODS: From September to December 2010, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected 
during antenatal care visits and at delivery from 109 pregnant women with
microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria infection. DBS were analysed by
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the polymorphisms at 
codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 of the Pfdhfr gene and codons 437 and 540 in the
Pfdhps gene.
RESULTS: Both the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were successfully genotyped in 92.7%
(101/109) of the samples. The prevalence of Pfdhfr mutations N51I, C59R and S108N
was 71.3, 42.6 and 64.4%, respectively. Overall, 80.2% (81/101) of samples
carried the Pfdhps A437G mutation. None of the samples had the Pfdhfr I164L and
the Pfdhps K540E mutations. The prevalence of the triple mutation
N51I + C59R + S108N was 25.7% (26/101). The use of IPTp-SP was associated with a 
threefold increased odds of Pfdhfr C59R mutation [crude OR 3.29; 95% CI
(1.44-7.50)]. Pregnant women with recent uptake of IPTp-SP were at higher odds of
both the Pfdhfr C59R mutation [adjusted OR 4.26; 95% CI (1.64-11.07)] and the
Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance, i.e., ≥ 2 Pfdhfr mutations [adjusted OR
3.45; 95% CI (1.18-10.07)]. There was no statistically significant association
between the presence of the Pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance and parasite
densities or both maternal haemoglobin level and anaemia.
CONCLUSION: The data indicate that despite the possibility that IPTp-SP
contributes to the selection of resistant parasites, it did not potentiate
pregnancy-associated malaria morbidity, suggesting the continuation of SP use as 
IPTp in Burkina Faso.
