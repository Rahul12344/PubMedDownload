BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance threatens malaria control in sub-Saharan
Africa. Knockdown resistance to pyrethroids and organochlorines in Anopheles
gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) is commonly caused by mutations in the gene encoding a 
voltage-gated sodium channel which is the target site for the insecticide. The
study aimed to examine risk factors for knockdown resistance in An. gambiae s.l. 
and its relationship with malaria infection in children in rural Gambia. Point
mutations at the Vgsc-1014 locus, were measured in An. gambiae s.l. during a
2-year trial.Â Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at the end of the
transmission season to measure malaria infection in children aged 6 months-14
years.
RESULTS: Whilst few Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles coluzzii had Vgsc-1014
mutations, the proportion of An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) mosquitoes
homozygous for the Vgsc-1014F mutation increased from 64.8 to 90.9% during the
study. The Vgsc-1014S or 1014F mutation was 80% higher in 2011 compared to 2010, 
and 27% higher in the villages with indoor residual spraying compared to those
without. An increase in the proportion of An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes with
homozygous Vgsc-1014F mutations and an increase in the proportion of An. gambiae 
s.s. in a cluster were each associated with increased childhood malaria
infection. Homozygous Vgsc-1014F mutations were, however, most common in An.
gambiae s.s. and almost reached saturation during the study meaning that the two 
variables were colinear.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of colinearity between homozygous Vgsc-1014F mutations
and An. gambiae s.s., it was not possible to determine whether insecticide
resistance or species composition increased the risk of childhood malaria
infection.
