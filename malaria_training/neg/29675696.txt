Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of global importance. There is an increasing
recognition of the role of Toll like receptors, important pattern recognition
receptors of host immune system, in determining the susceptibility or resistance 
to TB in various populations. In an attempt to examine the importance of Toll
like receptors in immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we
explored two variants each of TLR2 and TLR9 in a population residing in Uttar
Pradesh, India. Genotyping was performed to detect -196 to -174 del polymorphism 
and G2258A SNP (Arg753Gln, rs5743708) in TLR2 gene and -T1237C (rs5743836) and
G2848A (rs352140) SNP in TLR9 gene in patients with pulmonary TB and healthy
controls. The A allele of G2848A SNP in TLR9 gene was found with a marginally
higher frequency among TB patients as compared to healthy controls, suggesting
that A allele at position 2848 of TLR9 gene may be associated with susceptibility
to TB in North Indian population [p = 0.05, Mantel-Haenszel OR = 1.34, 95% CI
(1.0-1.82)].
