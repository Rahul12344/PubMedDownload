Malaria in humans is caused by six species of Plasmodium parasites, of which the 
nuclear genome sequences for the two Plasmodium ovale spp., P. ovale curtisi and 
P. ovale wallikeri, and Plasmodium malariae have not yet been analyzed. Here we
present an analysis of the nuclear genome sequences of these three parasites, and
describe gene family expansions therein. Plasmodium ovale curtisi and P. ovale
wallikeri are genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable and have
sympatric ranges through the tropics of Africa, Asia and Oceania. Both P. ovale
spp. show expansion of the surfin variant gene family, and an amplification of
the Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) superfamily which results in an
approximately 30% increase in genome size. For comparison, we have also analyzed 
the draft nuclear genome of P. malariae, a malaria parasite causing mild malaria 
symptoms with a quartan life cycle, long-term chronic infections, and wide
geographic distribution. Plasmodium malariae shows only a moderate level of
expansion of pir genes, and unique expansions of a highly diverged transmembrane 
protein family with over 550 members and the gamete P25/27 gene family. The
observed diversity in the P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi surface
antigens, combined with their phylogenetic separation, supports consideration
that the two parasites be given species status.
