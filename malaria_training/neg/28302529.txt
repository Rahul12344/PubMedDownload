Living organisms have evolved an array of genes coding for detoxifying enzymes
and efflux protein pumps, to cope with endogenous and xenobiotic toxic compounds.
The study of the genes activated during toxic exposure is relevant to the area of
arthropod vector control, since these genes are one of the targets upon which
natural selection acts for the evolution of insecticide resistance. ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters participate to insecticide detoxification acting as
efflux pumps, that reduce the intracellular concentration of toxic compounds, or 
of their metabolic derivatives. Here we analyzed the modulation of the expression
of six genes coding for ABC transporters, after the exposure of adult females and
males of the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, a major malaria vector in Asia, to
permethrin. Male and female mosquitoes were exposed to insecticide for one hour, 
then the expression profiles of the ABC transporter genes AnstABCB2, AnstABCB3,
AnstABCB4, AnstABCBmember6, AnstABCC11, and AnstABCG4 were analysed after one and
24h. Our results showed that three genes (AnstABCB2, AnstABCBmember6, AnstABCG4) 
were up-regulated in both sexes; two of these (AnstABCBmember6 and AnstABCG4)
have previously been shown to be up-regulated also in larval stages of An.
stephensi, supporting a role for these genes in permethrin defence in larvae as
well as in adults. Finally, the same ABC transporter genes were activated both in
females and males; however, the timing of gene induction was different, with a
prompter induction in females than in males.
