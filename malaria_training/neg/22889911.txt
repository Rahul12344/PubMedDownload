Malaria parasites belong to an ancient lineage that diverged very early from the 
main branch of eukaryotes. The approximately 90-member plasmodial kinome includes
a majority of eukaryotic protein kinases that clearly cluster within the AGC,
CMGC, TKL, CaMK and CK1 groups found in yeast, plants and mammals, testifying to 
the ancient ancestry of these families. However, several hundred millions years
of independent evolution, and the specific pressures brought about by first a
photosynthetic and then a parasitic lifestyle, led to the emergence of unique
features in the plasmodial kinome. These include taxon-restricted kinase
families, and unique peculiarities of individual enzymes even when they have
homologues in other eukaryotes. Here, we merge essential aspects of all three
malaria-related communications that were presented at the Evolution of Protein
Phosphorylation meeting, and propose an integrated discussion of the specific
features of the parasite's kinome and phosphoproteome.
