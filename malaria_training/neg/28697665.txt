Malaria is a significant threat throughout the developing world. Among the most
fascinating aspects of the protozoan parasites responsible for this disease are
the methods they employ to avoid the immune system and perpetuate chronic
infections. Key among these is antigenic variation: By systematically altering
antigens that are displayed to the host's immune system, the parasite renders the
adaptive immune response ineffective. For Plasmodium falciparum, the species
responsible for the most severe form of human malaria, this process involves a
complicated molecular mechanism that results in continuously changing patterns of
variant-antigen-encoding gene expression. Although many features of this process 
remain obscure, significant progress has been made in recent years to decipher
various molecular aspects of the regulatory cascade that causes chronic
infection.
