The aim of this paper is to review the use of genetics in palaeomicrobiology, and
to highlight the importance of understanding past diseases. Palaeomicrobiology is
the study of disease pathogens in skeletal and mummified remains from
archaeological contexts. It has revolutionarised our understanding of health in
the past by enabling a deeper knowledge of the origins and evolution of many
diseases that have shaped us as a species. Bacterial diseases explored include
tuberculosis, leprosy, bubonic plague, typhoid, syphilis, endemic and epidemic
typhus, trench fever, and Helicobacter pylori. Viral diseases discussed include
influenza, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus (HPV), human T-cell lymphotrophic
virus (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Parasitic diseases
investigated include malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, roundworm,
whipworm, pinworm, Chinese liver fluke, fleas and lice. Through a better
understanding of disease origins and their evolution, we can place into context
how many infectious diseases are changing over time, and so help us estimate how 
they may change in the future.
