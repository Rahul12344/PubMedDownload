OBJECTIVE: Insecticide resistance molecular markers can provide sensitive
indicators of resistance development in Anopheles vector populations. Assaying
these makers is of paramount importance in the resistance monitoring programme.
We investigated the presence and distribution of knock-down resistance (kdr)
mutations in Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Tanzania.
METHODS: Indoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 10 sites and
tested for insecticide resistance using the standard WHO protocol. Polymerase
chain reaction-based molecular diagnostics were used to genotype mosquitoes and
detect kdr mutations.
RESULTS: The An. gambiae tested were resistance to lambdacyhalothrin in Muheza,
Arumeru and Muleba. Out of 350 An. gambiae s.l. genotyped, 35% were An. gambiae
s.s. and 65% An. arabiensis. L1014S and L1014F mutations were detected in both
An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. L1014S point mutation was found at the
allelic frequency of 4-33%, while L1014F was at the allelic frequency 6-41%. The 
L1014S mutation was much associated with An. gambiae s.s. (χ(2) = 23.41; P <
0.0001) and L1014F associated with An. arabiensis (χ(2) = 11.21; P = 0.0008). The
occurrence of the L1014S allele was significantly associated with
lambdacyhalothrin resistance mosquitoes (Fisher exact P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The observed co-occurrence of L1014S and L1014F mutations coupled
with reports of insecticide resistance in the country suggest that pyrethroid
resistance is becoming a widespread phenomenon among our malaria vector
populations. The presence of L1014F mutation in this East African mosquito
population indicates the spreading of this gene across Africa. The potential
operational implications of these findings on malaria control need further
exploration.
