Malaria is a disease with diverse symptoms depending on host immune status and
pathogenicity of Plasmodium parasites. The continuous parasite growth within a
host suggests mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite and/or immune
inhibition in response to infection. To identify pathways commonly inhibited
after malaria infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with four Plasmodium yoelii
strains causing different disease phenotypes and 24 progeny of a genetic cross.
mRNAs from mouse spleens day 1 and/or day 4 post infection (p.i.) were hybridized
to a mouse microarray to identify activated or inhibited pathways, upstream
regulators, and host genes playing an important role in malaria infection. Strong
interferon responses were observed after infection with the N67 strain, whereas
initial inhibition and later activation of hematopoietic pathways were found
after infection with 17XNL parasite, showing unique responses to individual
parasite strains. Inhibitions of pathways such as Th1 activation, dendritic cell 
(DC) maturation, and NFAT immune regulation were observed in mice infected with
all the parasite strains day 4 p.i., suggesting universally inhibited immune
pathways. As a proof of principle, treatment of N67-infected mice with antibodies
against T cell receptors OX40 or CD28 to activate the inhibited pathways enhanced
host survival. Controlled activation of these pathways may provide important
strategies for better disease management and for developing an effective vaccine.
