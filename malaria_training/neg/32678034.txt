BACKGROUND: In the absence of microscopy, Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
proteins 2 (PfHRP2)-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are recommended for the
diagnosis of falciparum malaria, particularly in endemic regions. However,
genetic variability of the pfhrp2 gene threatens the usefulness of the test due
to its impact on RDT sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate the diversity
of pfhrp2 in malaria cases among children in Ghana.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Adidome Government Hospital
in the Volta Region of Ghana. A total of 50 children with mean age of
6.6 ± 3.5 years and diagnosed falciparum malaria were included. Blood samples
were collected for complete blood count, malaria parasite identification and
counting using auto analyzer and microscopy, respectively. DNA was isolated from 
blood-spotted Whatman filters, amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences were
translated in silico to corresponding amino acids and the deduced amino acids
sequences were analyzed for diversity using Mega X.
RESULTS: The number of repeats and number of each repeat within PfHRP2 varied
between isolates. Twelve rare PfHRP2 repeat types, two of which are previously
unreported, were identified in this study. The HRP2 sequence obtained in this
study shared high similarities with isolates from Kenya. Using Baker's regression
model, Group B was the highest occurring type (58.0%). Screening of all sequences
for epitopes recognized by PfHRP2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the
predominant motif was AHHAADAHH, which is recognized by the C1-13 mAbs.
CONCLUSION: This study reports diversity of P. falciparum HRP2 in samples from
Ghanaian children with symptomatic malaria. The findings of this study highlight 
the existence of extra amino acid repeat types which adds to the PfHRP2 antigenic
variability.
