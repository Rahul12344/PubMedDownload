Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe neurological complication causing acute
non-traumatic encephalopathy in tropical countries. The mechanisms underlying the
fatal cerebral complications are still not fully understood. Glutamate, a major
excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of the mammalian brain,
plays a key role in the development of neuronal cells, motor function, synaptic
plasticity, learning and memory processes under normal physiological conditions. 
The subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor are N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors 
(NMDARs) which are involved in cellular mechanisms of learning and memory,
synaptic plasticity and also mediate excitotoxic neuronal injury. In the present 
study, we found that glutamate level in synaptosomes, as well as expression of
NMDAR, was elevated during the extreme condition of CM in C57BL6 mice. Arteether 
at 50 mg kg-1 × 1, 25 mg kg-1 × 2, days decreased the NMDAR expression and
increased the overall survival of the experimental CM mice.
