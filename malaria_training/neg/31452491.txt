Bovine babesiosis is the most important protozoan disease transmitted by ticks.
In Plasmodium falciparum, another Apicomplexa protozoan, the interaction of
rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) with apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) has been
described to have a key role in the invasion process. To date, RON2 has not been 
described in Babesia bigemina, the causal agent of bovine babesiosis in the
Americas. In this work, we found a ron2 gene in the B. bigemina genome. RON2
encodes a protein that is 1351 amino acids long, has an identity of 64% (98%
coverage) with RON2 of B. bovis and contains the CLAG domain, a conserved domain 
in Apicomplexa. B. bigemina ron2 is a single copy gene and it is transcribed and 
expressed in blood stages as determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and confocal
microscopy. Serum samples from B. bigemina-infected bovines were screened for the
presence of RON2-specific antibodies, showing the recognition of conserved B-cell
epitopes. Importantly, in vitro neutralization assays showed an inhibitory effect
of RON2-specific antibodies on the red blood cell invasion by B. bigemina.
Therefore, RON2 is a novel antigen in B. bigemina and contains conserved B-cell
epitopes, which induce antibodies that inhibit merozoite invasion.
