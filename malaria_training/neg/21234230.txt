The onset, severity, and ultimate outcome of malaria infection are influenced by 
parasite-expressed virulence factors and individual host responses to these
determinants. In both humans and mice, liver injury is involved after parasite
entry, which persists until the erythrocyte stage after infection with the fatal 
strain Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has strong
anti-apoptotic effects in various kinds of cells, and also has diverse metabolic 
functions. In this work, Pf-subtilisin-like protease 2 (Pf-Sub2) 5'untranslated
region (UTR) was analyzed and its transcriptional activity was estimated by
luciferase expression. Fourteen TATA boxes were observed but only one Oct-1 and
c-Myb were done. In addition, host HGF interaction with Pf-Sub2 was evaluated by 
co-transfection of HGF- and Pf-Sub2-cloned vector. Interestingly, -1,422/+12 UTR 
exhibited the strongest luciferase activity but -329 to +12 UTR did not exhibit
luciferase activity. Moreover, as compared with the control of unexpressed HGF,
the HGF protein suppressed luciferase expression driven by the 5'untranslated
region of the Pf-Sub2 promoter. Taken together, it is suggested that HGF controls
and interacts with the promoter region of the Pf-Sub2 gene.
