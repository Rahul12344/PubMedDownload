A central problem in biology is to identify gene function. One approach is to
infer function in large supergenomic networks of interactions and ancestral
relationships among genes; however, their analysis can be computationally
prohibitive. We show here that these biological networks are compressible. They
can be shrunk dramatically by eliminating redundant evolutionary relationships,
and this process is efficient because in these networks the number of
compressible elements rises linearly rather than exponentially as in other
complex networks. Compression enables global network analysis to computationally 
harness hundreds of interconnected genomes and to produce functional predictions.
As a demonstration, we show that the essential, but functionally uncharacterized 
Plasmodium falciparum antigen EXP1 is a membrane glutathione S-transferase. EXP1 
efficiently degrades cytotoxic hematin, is potently inhibited by artesunate, and 
is associated with artesunate metabolism and susceptibility in drug-pressured
malaria parasites. These data implicate EXP1 in the mode of action of a frontline
antimalarial drug.
