BACKGROUND: Sugar-feeding provides energy for mosquitoes. Facilitated glucose
transporters (GLUTs) are responsible for the uptake of glucose in animals.
However, knowledge of GLUTs function in Anopheles spp. is limited.
METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of GLUTs in Anopheles stephensi was performed by
the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The spatial and temporal
expression patterns of four Asteglut genes were analyzed by qPCR. The function of
Asteglut1 was examined using a dsRNA-mediated RNA interference method.
Transcriptome analysis was used to investigate the global influence of Asteglut1 
on mosquito physiology.
RESULTS: We identified 4 glut genes, Asteglut1, Asteglutx, Asteglut3 and
Asteglut4 in An. stephensi. Asteglut1, Asteglut3 and Asteglut4 were mainly
expressed in the midgut. Plasmodium berghei infection differentially regulated
the expression of Asteglut genes with significant downregulation of Asteglut1 and
Asteglut4, while upregulation of Asteglutx. Only knocking-down Asteglut1
facilitated Plasmodium berghei infection in An. stephensi. This might be due to
the accumulation of glucose prior to blood-feeding in dsAsteglut1-treated
mosquitoes. Our transcriptome analysis revealed that knockdown of Asteglut1
differentially regulated expression of genes associated with multiple functional 
clusters, especially those related to detoxification and immunity. The
dysregulation of multiple pathways might contribute to the increased P. berghei
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Asteglut1 participates in defense against P.
berghei in An. stephensi. The regulation of Asteglut1 on vector competence might 
through modulating multiple biological processes, such as detoxification and
immunity.
