A dark brown tuft-forming cyanobacterium, morphologically resembling the genus
Symploca, was collected during an expedition to the Coiba National Park, a UNESCO
World Heritage Site on the Pacific coast of Panama. Phylogenetic analysis of its 
16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that it is 4.5% divergent from the type strain
for Symploca and thus is likely a new genus. Fractionation of the crude extract
led to the isolation of a new cytotoxin, designated santacruzamate A (1), which
has several structural features in common with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
[(2), SAHA, trade name Vorinostat], a clinically approved histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor used to treat refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Recognition 
of the structural similarly of 1 and SAHA led to the characterization of
santacruzamate A as a picomolar level selective inhibitor of HDAC2, a Class I
HDAC, with relatively little inhibition of HDAC4 or HDAC6, both Class II HDACs.
As a result, chemical syntheses of santacruzamate A as well as a structurally
intriguing hybrid molecule, which blends aspects of both agents (1 and 2), were
achieved and evaluated for their HDAC activity and specificity.
