The Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and its erythrocytic receptor,
the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), are involved in the major P.
vivax erythrocyte invasion pathway. An open cohort study to analyze DARC
genotypes and their relationship to PvDBP immune responses was carried out in 620
volunteers in an agricultural settlement of the Brazilian Amazon. Three
cross-sectional surveys were conducted at 6-month intervals, comprising 395, 410,
and 407 subjects, respectively. The incidence rates of P. vivax infection was
2.32 malaria episodes per 100 person-months under survey (95% confidence interval
[CI] of 1.92-2.80/100 person-month) and, of P. falciparum, 0.04 per 100
person-months (95% CI of 0.007-0.14/100 person-month). The distribution of DARC
genotypes was consistent with the heterogeneous ethnic origins of the Amazon
population, with a predominance of non-silent DARC alleles: FY*A > FY*B. The
12-month follow-up study demonstrated no association between DARC genotypes and
total IgG antibodies as measured by ELISA targeting PvDBP (region II, DBPII or
regions II-IV, DBPII-IV). The naturally acquired DBPII specific binding
inhibitory antibodies (BIAbs) tended to be more frequent in heterozygous
individuals carrying a DARC-silent allele (FY*BES). These results provide
evidence that DARC polymorphisms may influence the naturally acquired inhibitory 
anti-Duffy binding protein II immunity.
