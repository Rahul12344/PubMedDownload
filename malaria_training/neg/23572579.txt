Gametocytes are essential for Plasmodium transmission, but little is known about 
the mechanisms that lead to their formation. Using piggyBac transposon-mediated
insertional mutagenesis, we screened for parasites that no longer form mature
gametocytes, which led to the isolation of 29 clones (insertional
gametocyte-deficient mutants) that fail to form mature gametocytes. Additional
analysis revealed 16 genes putatively responsible for the loss of
gametocytogenesis, none of which has been previously implicated in
gametocytogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and detection of an early stage
gametocyte antigen determined that a subset of these mutants arrests development 
at stage I or in early stage II gametocytes, likely representing genes involved
in gametocyte maturation. The remaining mutants seem to arrest before formation
of stage I gametocytes and may represent genes involved in commitment to the
gametocyte lineage.
