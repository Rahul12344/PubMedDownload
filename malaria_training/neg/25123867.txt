The frequency of mutations in pfCRT and DHFR/DHPS genes of Plasmodium falciparum 
associated with resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was
evaluated in 83 strains from the districts of Esmeralda and Machala, located on
the borders of Ecuador-Peru and Ecuador-Colombia in 2002. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), conventional and its variants, was used. Mutations in the pfCRT
gene were found in more than 90% of the samples from Esmeralda and Machala. For
the DHFR gene, 90% of the strains were mutant samples from Esmeralda, 3 were
double mutations and 1 was a triple mutation. In Machala, 25% were simple mutant 
forms and 75% mixed mutant forms (wild forms/mutant). In conclusion, resistance
to chloroquine has been fixed in strains carrying K76T pfCRT mutation, whereas
genetic imprinting for resistance to pyrimethamine is evolving, particularly in
the district of Esmeralda.
