The ability of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to evade the immune system and 
be sequestered within human small blood vessels is responsible for severe forms
of malaria. The sequestration depends on the interaction between human
endothelial receptors and P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)
exposed on the surface of the infected erythrocytes (IEs). In this study, the
transcriptomes of parasite populations enriched for parasites that bind to human 
P-selectin, E-selectin, CD9 and CD151 receptors were analysed. IT4_var02 and
IT4_var07 were specifically expressed in IT4 parasite populations enriched for
P-selectin-binding parasites; eight var genes (IT4_var02/07/09/13/17/41/44/64)
were specifically expressed in isolate populations enriched for CD9-binding
parasites. Interestingly, IT4 parasite populations enriched for E-selectin- and
CD151-binding parasites showed identical expression profiles to those of a
parasite population exposed to wild-type CHO-745 cells. The same phenomenon was
observed for the 3D7 isolate population enriched for binding to P-selectin,
E-selectin, CD9 and CD151. This implies that the corresponding ligands for these 
receptors have either weak binding capacity or do not exist on the IE surface.
Conclusively, this work expanded our understanding of P. falciparum adhesive
interactions, through the identification of var transcripts that are enriched
within the selected parasite populations.
