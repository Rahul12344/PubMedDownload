Control of human soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) relies on preventive
chemotherapy of schoolchildren applying the benzimidazoles (BZ) albendazole or
mebendazole. Anthelmintic resistance (AR) is a common problem in nematodes of
veterinary importance but for human STHs, information on drug efficacy is limited
and routine monitoring is rarely implemented. Herein, the efficacy of single dose
albendazole (400 mg) was evaluated in 12 schools in the Huye district of Rwanda
where Ascaris is the predominant STH. Ascaris eggs were detected by wet mount
microscopy and the Mini-FLOTAC method to assess cure rate (CR) and faecal egg
count reduction (FECR). Blood and faecal samples were analysed for co-infections 
with Plasmodium sp. and Giardia duodenalis, respectively. Ascaris positive
samples collected before and after treatment were analysed for putatively
BZ-resistance associated β-tubulin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms. The
overall CR was 69.9% by Mini-FLOTAC and 88.6% by wet mount microscopy. The FECR
was 75.4% and the 95% calculated confidence intervals were 50.4-87.8% using
sample variance, 55.4-88.8% by bootstrapping, and 75.0-75.7% applying a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian approach. FECR varied widely between 0 and 96.8% for
individual schools. No putative BZ-resistance associated polymorphisms were found
in the four Ascaris β-tubulin isotype genes examined. Since FECRs <95% indicate
reduced efficacy, these findings raise the suspicion of BZ resistance. In the
absence of respective molecular evidence, heritable AR in the local Ascaris
populations cannot be formally proven. However, since FECRs <95% indicate reduced
efficacy, BZ resistance may be suspected which would be alarming and calls for
further analyses and routine monitoring in preventive chemotherapy programs.
