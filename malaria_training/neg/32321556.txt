BACKGROUND: Olfactory cues drive mosquito behaviors such as host-seeking,
locating sugar sources and oviposition. These behaviors can vary between sexes
and closely related species. For example, the malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii
is highly anthropophilic, whereas An. quadriannulatus is not. These behavioral
differences may be reflected in chemosensory gene expression.
METHODS: The expression of chemosensory genes in the antennae of both sexes of
An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus was compared using RNA-seq. The sex-biased
expression of several genes in An. coluzzii was also compared using qPCR.
RESULTS: The chemosensory expression is mostly similar in the male antennae of
An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus, with only a few modest differences in
expression. A handful of chemosensory genes are male-biased in both species; the 
highly expressed gustatory receptor AgGr33, odorant binding proteins AgObp25,
AgObp26 and possibly AgObp10. Although the chemosensory gene repertoire is mostly
shared between the sexes, several highly female-biased AgOrs, AgIrs, and one
AgObp were identified, including several whose expression is biased towards the
anthropophilic An. coluzzii. Additionally, the expression of several chemosensory
genes is biased towards An. coluzzii in both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensory gene expression is broadly similar between species and 
sexes, but several sex- biased/specific genes were identified. These may modulate
sex- and species-specific behaviors. Although the male behavior of these species 
remains poorly studied, the identification of sex- and species-specific
chemosensory genes may provide fertile ground for future work.
