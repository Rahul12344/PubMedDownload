BACKGROUND: China has made progress in malaria control and aims to eliminate
malaria nationwide, but implementing effective interventions along the border
regions remain a huge task. The Plasmodium falciparum cases imported from
Southeast Asia has frequently reported especially in the China-Myanmar border
(CMB) area. Though, information is scant on P. falciparum genetic variability in 
this area.
METHODS: This study reported P. falciparum isolates genome sequence of six
clinical isolates in the CMB area. Furthermore, we estimated the nucleotide
diversity, Watterson's estimator and Tajima's D value for the whole genome
mutation rate in slide window.
RESULTS: Our data were aligned onto 96.05-98.61% of the reference 3D7 genome in
high fold coverages. Principal component analysis result showed that P.
falciparum clustered generally according to their geographic origin. A total of
91 genes were identified as positive selection with Ka/Ks ratio significantly
higher than 1, and most of them were multigene families encoding variant surface 
antigens (VSAs) such as var, rif and stevor. The enrichment of the positive
selection on VSA genes implied that the environment complexity subjected CMB's P.
falciparum to more pressure for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that greater genetic diversity in CMB area and
the positive selection signals in VSA genes, which allow P. falciparum to fit the
host immune system well and aggravate the difficulty of treatment. Meanwhile,
results obtained from this study will provide the fundamental basis for P.
falciparum population genomic research in CMB area.
