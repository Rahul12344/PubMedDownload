BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the first-line
anti-malarial treatment of uncomplicated malaria in most malaria endemic
countries, including Tanzania. Unfortunately, there have been reports of
artemisinin resistance and ACT failure from South East Asia highlighting the need
to monitor therapeutic efficacy of ACT in these countries as recommended by World
Health Organization.
METHODS: Open-label single arm studies in mainland Tanzania were conducted in
nine sentinel sites in 2011, 2012 and 2015 to assess the efficacy and safety of
artemether/lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ) using 28 days
follow-up and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHAPQ) using 42 days follow-up.
Mutations in the propeller domain of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13)
gene and amplification of the P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pm2) gene, associated
with artemisinin and piperaquine (PQ) resistance, were also investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 428 patients enrolled, 328 patients provided study endpoint. For 
AL, the PCR corrected per-protocol analysis showed adequate clinical and
parasitological response (ACPR) of 90.3% (n = 28; 95% CI 74.2-98.0) in Kyela
2012, 95.7% (n = 22; 95% CI 78.1-99.0) in Chamwino, 100% in Muheza (n = 29; 95%
CI 88.1-100), 100% in Nagaga (n = 39; 95% CI 91.0-100) and Kyela 2015 (n = 60;
95% CI 94.0-100). For ASAQ, PCR corrected ACPR of 98% (n = 49; 95% CI 89.4-99.9) 
and 100% (n = 25; 95% CI 86.3-100) were observed in 2011 in Ujiji and Kibaha,
respectively. For DHAPQ, the ACPR was 100% (n = 71; 95% CI 94.9-100). Of the 235 
samples with genetic interpretable results, only 7 (3%) had non-synonymous k13
mutations. None of these are candidate or validated markers of artemisinin
resistance and all patients carrying these alleles cleared the parasites on day
3. Of the DHAPQ group, 10% (3/29) of the samples with interpretable results had
pm2 multiple copies and none of them was associated with treatment failure.
CONCLUSION: All the tested ACT in mainland Tanzania were highly efficacious and
none of validated k13 mutants associated with artemisinin resistance was
observed. However, three isolates with multiple copy numbers of pm2 gene
associated with PQ resistance among the limited samples tested successfully calls
for further investigation. Trial registration Number ACTRN12615000159550.
