Malaria has been a very strong selection pressure in recent human evolution,
particularly in Africa. Of the one million deaths per year due to malaria, more
than 90% are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with high levels of genetic
variation and population substructure. However, there have been few studies of
nucleotide variation at genetic loci that are relevant to malaria susceptibility 
across geographically and genetically diverse ethnic groups in Africa. Invasion
of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum parasites is central to the pathology of
malaria. Glycophorin A (GYPA) and B (GYPB), which determine MN and Ss blood
types, are two major receptors that are expressed on erythrocyte surfaces and
interact with parasite ligands. We analyzed nucleotide diversity of the
glycophorin gene family in 15 African populations with different levels of
malaria exposure. High levels of nucleotide diversity and gene conversion were
found at these genes. We observed divergent patterns of genetic variation between
these duplicated genes and between different extracellular domains of GYPA.
Specifically, we identified fixed adaptive changes at exons 3-4 of GYPA. By
contrast, we observed an allele frequency spectrum skewed toward a significant
excess of intermediate-frequency alleles at GYPA exon 2 in many populations; the 
degree of spectrum distortion is correlated with malaria exposure, possibly
because of the joint effects of gene conversion and balancing selection. We also 
identified a haplotype causing three amino acid changes in the extracellular
domain of glycophorin B. This haplotype might have evolved adaptively in five
populations with high exposure to malaria.
