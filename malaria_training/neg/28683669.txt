In order to achieve better outcomes for treatment and in the prophylaxis of
malaria, it is imperative to develop a sensitive, specific, and accurate assay
for early diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection, which is the major cause 
of malaria. In this study, we aimed to develop a loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) assay with P. falciparum unique genes for sensitive,
specific, and accurate detection of P. falciparum infection. The unique genes of 
P. falciparum were randomly selected from PlasmoDB. The LAMP primers of the
unique genes were designed using PrimerExplorer V4. LAMP assays with primers from
unique genes of P. falciparum and conserved 18S rRNA gene were developed and
their sensitivity was assessed. The specificity of the most sensitive LAMP assay 
was further examined using genomic DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium yoelii
and Toxoplasma gondii. Finally, the unique gene-based LAMP assay was validated
using clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. A total of 31 sets of
top-scored LAMP primers from nine unique genes were selected from the pools of
designed primers. The LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was the most sensitive with
the detection limit 5 parasites/μl, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the
genomic DNA samples of P. vivax, P. yoelii, and T. gondii. The LAMP assay with
PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) was less sensitive with the detection limit 50
parasites/μl, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the genomic DNA samples
of P. yoelii and T. gondii, but displayed positive LAMP detection with P. vivax. 
The positive detection rate of the LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was 90%
(27/30), higher than that (80%, 24/30) of the positive rate of PF3D7_0112300 (18S
rRNA) in examining clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. The LAMP
assay with the primer set PF3D7_1253300-5 was more sensitive, specific, and
accurate than those with PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) in examining P. falciparum
infection, and therefore it is a promising tool for diagnosis of P. falciparum
infection.
