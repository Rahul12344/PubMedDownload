Genetic polymorphisms in diagnostic antigens are important factors responsible
for variable performance of rapid diagnostic tests. Additionally, the failure of 
antigen expression due to gene deletion may also contribute to variable
performance. We report Indian Plasmodium falciparum field isolates lacking both
Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes leading to false negative results of rapid diagnostic
tests. The study highlights need to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum
isolates lacking these genes in larger field populations in India.
