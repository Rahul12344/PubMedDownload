BACKGROUND: The safety and immunogenicity of PfAMA1, adjuvanted with
Alhydrogel(®) was assessed in malaria-experienced Malian adults. The malaria
vaccine, PfAMA1-FVO [25-545] is a recombinant protein Pichia pastoris-expressed
AMA-1 from Plasmodium falciparum FVO clone adsorbed to Alhydrogel(®), the control
vaccine was tetanus toxoid produced from formaldehyde detoxified and purified
tetanus toxin.
METHODS: A double blind randomized controlled phase 1 study enrolled and followed
40 healthy adults aged 18-55 years in Bandiagara, Mali, West Africa, a rural
setting with intense seasonal transmission of P. falciparum malaria. Volunteers
were randomized to receive either 50 µg of malaria vaccine or the control
vaccine. Three doses of vaccine were given on Days 0, 28 and 56, and participants
were followed for 1 year. Solicited symptoms were assessed for seven days and
unsolicited symptoms for 28 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events
were assessed throughout the study. The titres of anti-AMA-1 antibodies were
measured by ELISA and P. falciparum growth inhibition assays were performed.
RESULTS: Commonest local solicited adverse events were the injection site pain
and swelling more frequent in the PfAMA1 group. No vaccine related serious
adverse events were reported. A significant 3.5-fold increase of anti-AMA-1 IgG
antibodies was observed in malaria vaccine recipients four weeks after the third 
immunization compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: The PfAMA1 showed a good safety profile. Most adverse events reported
were of mild to moderate intensity. In addition, the vaccine induced a
significant though short-lived increase in the anti-AMA1 IgG titres. Registered
on www.clinicaltrials.gov with the number NCT00431808.
