BACKGROUND: With the premise of diminishing parasite genetic diversity following 
the reduction of malaria incidence, the analysis of polymorphic antigenic markers
may provide important information about the impact of malaria control on local
parasite populations. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity of Plasmodium vivax
apical membrane antigen 1 (Pvama1) gene in a parasite population from the
China-Myanmar border and compared it with global P. vivax populations.
METHODS: We performed evolutionary analysis to examine the genetic diversity,
natural selection, and population differentiation of 73 Pvama1 sequences acquired
from the China-Myanmar border as well as 615 publically available Pvama1
sequences from seven global P. vivax populations.
RESULTS: A total of 308 Pvama1 haplotypes were identified among the global P.
vivax isolates. The overall nucleotide diversity of Pvama1 gene among the 73
China-Myanmar border parasite isolates was 0.008 with 41 haplotypes being
identified (Hd = 0.958). Domain I (DI) harbored the majority (26/33) of the
polymorphic sites. The McDonald Kreitman test showed a significant positive
selection across the ectodomain and the DI of Pvama1. The fixation index (F ST ) 
estimation between the China-Myanmar border, Thailand (0.01) and Myanmar (0.10)
showed only slight geographical genetic differentiation. Notably, the Sal-I
haplotype was not detected in any of the analyzed global isolates, whereas the
Belem strain was restricted to the Thai population. The detected mutations are
mapped outside the overlapped region of the predicted B-cell epitopes and
intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed high levels of genetic diversity of Pvama1 in
the P. vivax parasite population from the China-Myanmar border with DI displaying
stronger diversifying selection than other domains. There were low levels of
population subdivision among parasite populations from the Greater Mekong
Subregion.
