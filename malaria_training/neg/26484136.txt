Antisense transcription is pervasive among biological systems and one of the
products of antisense transcription is natural antisense transcripts (NATs).
Emerging evidences suggest that they are key regulators of gene expression. With 
the discovery of NATs in Plasmodium falciparum, it has been suggested that these 
might also be playing regulatory roles in this parasite. However, all the reports
describing the diversity of NATs have come from parasites in culture condition
except for a recent study published by us. In order to explore the in vivo
diversity of NATs in P. falciparum clinical isolates, we performed a whole genome
expression profiling using a strand-specific 244Â K microarray that contains
probes for both sense and antisense transcripts. In this report, we describe the 
experimental procedure and analysis thereof of the microarray data published
recently in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE44921. This
published data provide a wealth of information about the prevalence of NATs in P.
falciparum clinical isolates from patients with diverse malaria related disease
conditions. Supplementary information about the description and interpretation of
the data can be found in a recent publication by Subudhi et al. in Experimental
Parasitology (2014).
