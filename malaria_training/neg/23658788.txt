Successful development of Plasmodium in the mosquito is essential for the
transmission of malaria. A major bottleneck in parasite numbers occurs during
midgut invasion, partly as a consequence of the complex interactions between the 
endogenous microbiota and the mosquito immune response. We previously identified 
SRPN6 as an immune component which restricts Plasmodium berghei development in
the mosquito. Here we demonstrate that SRPN6 is differentially activated by
bacteria in Anopheles stephensi, but only when bacteria exposure occurs on the
lumenal surface of the midgut epithelium. Our data indicate that AsSRPN6 is
strongly induced following exposure to Enterobacter cloacae, a common component
of the mosquito midgut microbiota. We conclude that AsSRPN6 is a vital component 
of the E. cloacae-mediated immune response that restricts Plasmodium development 
in the mosquito An. stephensi.
