OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in mice is a model for human
cerebral malaria, the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum
infection. Responses of brain microglia have been little investigated, and may
contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. We showed previously that
microglia are activated in P. berghei infections, and that Type 1-Interferon
signaling is important for activation. This dataset compares transcriptomic
profiles of brain microglia of infected mice in the presence and absence of Type 
1 interferon signaling, with the aim of identifying genes in microglia in this
pathway during experimental cerebral malaria.
DATA DESCRIPTION: We documented global gene expression from microglial RNA from
uninfected and P berghei-infected wild-type C57BL/6 and IFNA Receptor Knock-out
mice using Illumina Beadarrays. Principal component analysis showed 4 groups of
samples corresponding to naïve wild-type, naïve IFNA Receptor knock-out, infected
wild-type, and IFNA Receptor knock-out mice. Differentially-expressed genes of
microglia from the two groups of infected mice are documented. Gene set
enrichment analysis showing the top 500 genes assigned to Reactome pathways from 
infected IFNA Receptor knock-out versus naïve, and infected WT versus naïve has
been generated. These data will be useful for those interested in microglia
cells, and in experimental cerebral malaria.
