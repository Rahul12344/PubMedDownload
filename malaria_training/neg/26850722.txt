Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) aquasalis is a malaria vector mainly distributed along 
the coastal regions of South and Central America. In the absence of an effective 
vaccine against malaria, strategies for controlling the vector are the main tool 
for interrupting parasite transmission. Mechanisms of oogenesis and embryogenesis
in anautogenous mosquitoes are mainly modulated by blood feeding. However, the
expression, at the protein level, of genes involved in such mechanisms in
sugar-fed females is unknown. In this work, total protein extracts of the
reproductive tract of female An. aquasalis that were fed sugar were analyzed
using liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry for protein
identification and bioinformatic tools for data mining. We identified 922
proteins expressed in the organ, and using several databases, we attributed
biological meaning for several of them. Remarkably, nine proteins involved in
oogenesis were identified in females fed sugar. Putative vitellogenins,
vitellogenin receptor, lipid storage droplet, transferrin, ferritin, and
apolipoprotein, identified here, are proteins involved in egg development.
Proteins involved in embryonic development, such as paxillin, exuperantia,
several growth factors, and dorsal switch protein, were identified.
Interestingly, in this study, we identified 15 peptidases of various classes such
as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, serine protease, cathepsin, and
metalloprotease that could potentially interact with male seminal components.
Here, we demonstrated that the reproductive tract of female An. aquasalis fed on 
sugar expresses proteins involved in oogenesis and embryonic development. These
findings reveal unknown aspects of the physiology of this organ under the given
nutritional conditions.
