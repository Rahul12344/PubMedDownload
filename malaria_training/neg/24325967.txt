BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum placental infection primes the fetal immune
system and alters infant immunity. Mechanisms leading to these outcomes are not
completely understood. We focused on Vγ2Vδ2 cells, which are part of the immune
response against many pathogens, including P. falciparum. These unconventional
lymphocytes respond directly to small, nonpeptidic antigens, independent of major
histocompatibility complex presentation. We wondered whether placental malaria,
which may increase fetal exposure to P. falciparum metabolites, triggers a
response by neonatal Vγ2Vδ2 lymphocytes that can be a marker for the extent of
fetal exposure to malarial antigens.
METHODS: Cord blood mononuclear cells were collected from 15 neonates born to
mothers with P. falciparum infection during pregnancy (8 with placental malaria) 
and 25 unexposed neonates. Vγ2Vδ2 cell phenotype, repertoire, and proliferative
responses were compared between newborns exposed and those unexposed to P.
falciparum.
RESULTS: Placental malaria-exposed neonates had increased proportions of central 
memory Vγ2Vδ2 cells in cord blood, with an altered Vγ2 chain repertoire ex vivo
and after stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that placental malaria affects the phenotype and 
repertoire of neonatal Vγ2Vδ2 lymphocytes. Placental malaria may lower the
capacity for subsequent Vγ2Vδ2 cell responses and impair the natural resistance
to infectious diseases or the response to pediatric vaccination.
