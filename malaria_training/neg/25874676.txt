Artemisinins are the cornerstone of anti-malarial drugs. Emergence and spread of 
resistance to them raises risk of wiping out recent gains achieved in reducing
worldwide malaria burden and threatens future malaria control and elimination on 
a global level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed parasite
genetic loci associated with artemisinin resistance. However, there is no
consensus on biochemical targets of artemisinin. Whether and how these targets
interact with genes identified by GWAS, remains unknown. Here we provide
biochemical and cellular evidence that artemisinins are potent inhibitors of
Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PfPI3K), revealing an
unexpected mechanism of action. In resistant clinical strains, increased PfPI3K
was associated with the C580Y mutation in P. falciparum Kelch13 (PfKelch13), a
primary marker of artemisinin resistance. Polyubiquitination of PfPI3K and its
binding to PfKelch13 were reduced by the PfKelch13 mutation, which limited
proteolysis of PfPI3K and thus increased levels of the kinase, as well as its
lipid product phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find PI3P levels to be 
predictive of artemisinin resistance in both clinical and engineered laboratory
parasites as well as across non-isogenic strains. Elevated PI3P induced
artemisinin resistance in absence of PfKelch13 mutations, but remained responsive
to regulation by PfKelch13. Evidence is presented for PI3P-dependent signalling
in which transgenic expression of an additional kinase confers resistance.
Together these data present PI3P as the key mediator of artemisinin resistance
and the sole PfPI3K as an important target for malaria elimination.
