OBJECTIVE: To characterize the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum (P.
falciparum) field isolates in children from Lafia, North-central Nigeria, using
the highly polymorphic P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP-2) gene as 
molecular marker.
METHODS: Three hundred and twenty children were enrolled into the study between
2005 and 2006. These included 140 children who presented with uncomplicated
malaria at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia and another 180 children
from the study area with asymptomatic infection. DNA was extracted from blood
spot on filter paper and MSP-2 genes were genotyped using allele-specific nested 
PCR in order to analyze the genetic diversity of parasite isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 31 and 34 distinct MSP-2 alleles were identified in the
asymptomatic and uncomplicated malaria groups respectively. No difference was
found between the multiplicity of infection in the asymptomatic group and that of
the uncomplicated malaria group (P>0.05). However, isolates of the FC27 allele
type were dominant in the asymptomatic group whereas isolates of the 3D7 allele
type were dominant in the uncomplicated malaria group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates
in North-central Nigeria and is comparable to reports from similar areas with
high malaria transmission intensity.
