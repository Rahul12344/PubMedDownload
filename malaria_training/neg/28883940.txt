BACKGROUND: At present, only microscopic examination of stained thick and thin
blood smears for malaria can differentiate clinically relevant asexual
parasitemia from clinically irrelevant isolated gametocytemia. Microscopy is time
consuming, labour intensive, and requires significant technical expertise to
perform. Simple and rapid tests that can distinguish asexual from isolated sexual
parasitemia are needed.
METHODS: To determine if parasitemia and cycle threshold (CT) values on
Plasmodium genus and P. falciparum-specific quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) assays correlate to positivity of rapid diagnostic test (RDT),
and 18S rRNA gene copy number, we analyzed blood samples from Ontario patients
with isolated P. falciparum gametocytemia or asexual stages. RNA transcripts were
evaluated to determine whether there is correlation of expression to different
life cycle stages of P. falciparum.
RESULTS: 45 specimens containing isolated P. falciparum gametocytes, and 40
specimens containing isolated asexual stages by microscopy were identified and
analyzed. By RDT, 40 of 45 (88.9 %) isolated gametocytemia specimens and 40 of 40
(100 %) asexual-stage specimens were positive for Plasmodium falciparum-specific 
histidine rich protein-2 (HRP-2). Fourteen of 45 (31.1 %) isolated gametocytemia 
specimens, and 36 of 40 (90 %) asexual-stage specimens were positive for
Plasmodium genus aldolase T2 band. Positivity of the aldolase T2 band was
associated with lower mean Plasmodium genus and P. falciparum-specific CT values,
and to higher mean 18S rRNA gene copy by qPCR for both isolated gametocytemia and
asexual-stage specimens. There was also a negative correlation of asexual
parasitemia to both CT values, and positive correlation to 18S rRNA gene copy
number. Analysis of asexual stage-specific erythrocyte binding antigen (eba-175) 
transcripts on 25 isolated gametocytemia and 20 asexual-stage specimens gave a
positive predictive value of 62.5 % and negative predictive value of 100 % for
asexual parasitemia. Thus, an absence of eba-175 transcripts excluded the
presence of asexual (clinically relevant) parasitemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Positivity of the aldolase T2 band of BinaxNow RDT correlated to
higher parasite load in both isolated gametocytemia and asexual-stage specimens. 
Asexual stage-specific eba-175 RNA transcript expression provided reasonable
negative predictive value for exclusion of asexual parasitemia in clinical
samples, but was present in both isolated gametocytemia and asexual stage
specimens.
