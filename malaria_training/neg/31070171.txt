Background & objectives: Submicroscopic malaria infections with low parasite
density serve as a silent reservoir for maintaining residual transmission in the 
population. These infections should be identified and targeted to be eliminated
for sustained malaria control. The conventional methods of diagnosis such as
light microscopy and rapid diagnostic kits often fail to detect low density
infections. Therefore, the more sensitive molecular techniques should be employed
to detect low density infections. The objectives of the study was to explore the 
prevalence of sub-microscopic infections in low transmission areas of Punjab
using highly sensitive molecular tool.
Methods: A total of 1114 finger prick blood samples were collected through active
surveillance and tested for malaria diagnosis using light microscopy, RDT and
PCR. Nested PCR amplification was performed using a pair of Plasmodium
genus-specific primers from the 18S rRNA small subunit gene (18S rRNA). The
amplified PCR products were analysed using a 2% agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide and observed under transilluminator.
Results: Test positive rate (TPR) by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 4.4, 3.95 and
5.75%, respectively. Microscopy and RDT failed to detect mixed infections whereas
0.26% cases were found to be mixed infection in PCR. Compared to LM and RDT, PCR 
has detected 1.3% additional positive cases. However, of the total positive cases
detected by PCR, 23.4% infections were found to be submicroscopic, which could
not be detected by conventional methods of diagnosis.
Interpretation & conclusions: The molecular study revealed the existence of
submicroscopic malaria cases in the study population which would have remained
undetected by conventional methods of diagnosis. This is particularly important
because Punjab state is in malaria elimination phase and targeted to achieve
elimination in 2021. However, such undetected parasite positive cases may pose
bigger problem any time due to continued transmission. Therefore, application of 
more sensitive diagnostic tools like PCR and LAMP with conventional methods may
be much more useful in case detection particularly in low transmission settings
for malaria elimination.
