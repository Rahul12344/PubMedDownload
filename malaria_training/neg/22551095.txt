The increased spread of drug-resistant malaria highlights the need for
alternative drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. The combination of
atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®) has shown high efficacy against Plasmodium
falciparum with only mild side-effects. Treatment failures have been attributed
to suboptimal dosages or to parasite resistance resulting from a point mutation
in the cytochrome b gene. In this paper, a case of early treatment failure was
reported in a patient treated with atovaquone-proguanil; this failure was not
associated with a mutation in the parasite cytochrome b gene, with impaired drug 
bioavailability, or with re-infection.
