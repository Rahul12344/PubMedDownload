A prerequisite for reliable detection of low-density Plasmodium infections in
malaria pre-elimination settings is the availability of ultra-sensitive and
high-throughput molecular tools. We developed a SYBR Green real-time PCR
restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (cytb-qPCR) targeting the
cytochrome b gene of the four major human Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P.
vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale) for parasite detection and species
determination with DNA extracted from dried blood spots collected on filter
paper. The performance of cytb-qPCR was first compared against four reference PCR
methods using serially diluted Plasmodium samples. The detection limit of the
cytb-qPCR was 1 parasite/μl (p/μl) for P. falciparum and P. ovale, and 2 p/μl for
P. vivax and P. malariae, while the reference PCRs had detection limits of 0.5-10
p/μl. The ability of the PCR methods to detect low-density Plasmodium infections 
was then assessed using 2977 filter paper samples collected during a
cross-sectional survey in Zanzibar, a malaria pre-elimination setting in
sub-Saharan Africa. Field samples were defined as 'final positive' if positive in
at least two of the five PCR methods. Cytb-qPCR preformed equal to or better than
the reference PCRs with a sensitivity of 100% (65/65; 95%CI 94.5-100%) and a
specificity of 99.9% (2910/2912; 95%CI 99.7-100%) when compared against 'final
positive' samples. The results indicate that the cytb-qPCR may represent an
opportunity for improved molecular surveillance of low-density Plasmodium
infections in malaria pre-elimination settings.
