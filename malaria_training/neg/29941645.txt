Antimalarial drug resistance developed in Plasmodium falciparum has become a
problem for malaria control. Evaluation of drug resistance is the first step for 
effective malaria control. In this study, we investigated the gene mutations of
P. falciparum using blood samples from returned Chinese migrant workers in order 
to identify drug resistance-associated molecular markers. These workers returned 
from Africa and Southeast Asia (SEA) during 2011 to 2016. Polymorphisms in pfcrt,
pfmdr1, and k13-propeller genes and the haplotype patterns of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1
were analyzed. The results showed the presence of four haplotypes of Pfcrt codons
72 to 76, including CVMNK (wild type), SVMNT and CVIET (mutation types), and CV
M/I N/E K/T (mixed type), with 50.57%, 1.14%, 25.00%, and 23.30% prevalence,
respectively. For Pfmdr1, N86Y (22.28%) and Y184F (60.01%) were the main
prevalent mutations (mutations are underlined). The prevalence of mutation at
position 550, 561, 575, and 589 of K13-propeller were 1.09%, 0.54%, 0.54%, and
0.54%, respectively. These data suggested that Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, and K13-propeller
polymorphisms are potential markers to assess drug resistance of P. falciparum in
China, Africa, and SEA.
