BACKGROUND: Large-scale implementation of Indoor Residual Spraying and
Insecticide Treated Nets has been implemented in Plateau Department, Benin
between 2011 and 2014. The purpose of this study was to monitor the frequency and
mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors following the
implementation of vector control tools for malaria prevention.
METHODS: Anopheles larvae were collected in 13 villages twice a year from 2012 to
2014. WHO tube tests were used to assess the phenotypic resistance of each
population to 0.05 % deltamethrin. Sibling species within Anopheles gambiae
complex were identified by PCR techniques. Taqman and biochemical assays were
performed to identify the presence of kdr mutations in individual mosquitoes and 
to detect any increase in the activity of enzymes putatively involved in
insecticide metabolism (oxidases, esterase and glutathione-S-transferases).
Quantitative real time PCR was used to measure the expression of three metabolic 
genes involved in pyrethroid resistance (CYP6P3, CYP6M2 and GSTD3).
RESULTS: Anopheles populations showed < 90 % mortality to deltamethrin in all
villages and at all time points. The 1014 F kdr allele frequency was close to
fixation (> 0.9) over the sampling periods in both An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. 
Biochemical assays showed higher activities of alpha esterase and GST in field
malaria vector populations compared to susceptible mosquitoes. qPCR assays showed
a significant increase of CYP6P3, CYP6M2 GSTD3 expression in An. gambiae after a 
three-year implementation of LLINs.
CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that deltamethrin resistance is widespread in
malaria vectors in Southern Benin. We suspect that the increase in deltamethrin
resistance between 2012 and 2014 resulted from an increased expression of
metabolic detoxification genes (CYP6M2 and CYP6P3) rather than from kdr
mutations. It is urgent to evaluate further the impact of metabolic resistance on
the efficacy of vector control interventions using pyrethroid insecticides.
