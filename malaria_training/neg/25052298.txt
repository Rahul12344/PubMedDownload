Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a critical role in malaria case
management, surveillance and case investigations. Test performance is largely
determined by design and quality characteristics, such as detection sensitivity, 
specificity, and thermal stability. However, parasite characteristics such as
variable or absent expression of antigens targeted by RDTs can also affect RDT
performance. Plasmodium falciparum parasites lacking the PfHRP2 protein, the most
common target antigen for detection of P. falciparum, have been reported in some 
regions. Therefore, accurately mapping the presence and prevalence of P.
falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 would be an important step so that RDTs
targeting alternative antigens, or microscopy, can be preferentially selected for
use in such regions. Herein the available evidence and molecular basis for
identifying malaria parasites lacking PfHRP2 is reviewed, and a set of
recommended procedures to apply for future investigations for parasites lacking
PfHRP2, is proposed.
