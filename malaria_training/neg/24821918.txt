Mosquito-borne diseases are causing a substantial burden of mortality, morbidity 
and economic loss in many parts of the world, despite current control efforts,
and new complementary approaches to controlling these diseases are needed. One
promising class of new interventions under development involves the heritable
modification of the mosquito by insertion of novel genes into the nucleus or of
Wolbachia endosymbionts into the cytoplasm. Once released into a target
population, these modifications can act to reduce one or more components of the
mosquito population's vectorial capacity (e.g. the number of female mosquitoes,
their longevity or their ability to support development and transmission of the
pathogen). Some of the modifications under development are designed to be
self-limiting, in that they will tend to disappear over time in the absence of
recurrent releases (and hence are similar to the sterile insect technique, SIT), 
whereas other modifications are designed to be self-sustaining, spreading through
populations even after releases stop (and hence are similar to traditional
biological control). Several successful field trials have now been performed with
Aedes mosquitoes, and such trials are helping to define the appropriate
developmental pathway for this new class of intervention.
