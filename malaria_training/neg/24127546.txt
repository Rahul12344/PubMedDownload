On the effects of malaria treatment on parasite drug resistance--probability
modelling of genotyped malaria infections.

Kum CK, Thorburn D, Ghilagaber G, Gil P, Björkman A.

We compare the frequency of resistant genes of malaria parasites before treatment
and at first malaria incidence after treatment. The data come from a clinical
trial at two health facilities in Tanzania and concerns single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) at three positions believed to be related to resistance to
malaria treatment. A problem is that mixed infections are common, which both
obscures the underlying frequency of alleles at each locus as well as the
associations between loci in samples where alleles are mixed. We use
combinatorics and quite involved probability methods to handle multiple
infections and multiple haplotypes. The infection with the different haplotypes
seemed to be independent of each other. We showed that at two of the three
studied SNPs, the proportion of resistant genes had increased after treatment
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone but when treated in combination with
artesunate, no effect was noticed. First recurrences of malaria associated more
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone as treatment than when in combination with
artesunate. We also found that the recruited children had two different ongoing
malaria infections where the parasites had different gene types.
