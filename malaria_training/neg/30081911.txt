BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of global paediatric mortality in
children below 5 years of age. The number of fatalities has reduced significantly
due to an expansion of control interventions but the development of new
technologies remains necessary in order to achieve elimination. Recent attention 
has been focused on the release of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes into
natural vector populations as a mechanism of interrupting parasite transmission
but despite successful in vivo laboratory studies, a detailed population genetic 
assessment, which must first precede any proposed field trial, has yet to be
undertaken systematically. Here, the genetic structure of Anopheles gambiae
populations in north-western Lake Victoria is explored to assess their
suitability as candidates for a pilot field study release of GM mosquitoes.
METHODS: 478 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were collected from six locations and a
subset (N = 96) was selected for restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
(RADseq). The resulting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker set was
analysed for effective size (Ne), connectivity and population structure (PCA,
FST).
RESULTS: 5175 high-quality genome-wide SNPs were identified. A principal
components analysis (PCA) of the collinear genomic regions illustrated that
individuals clustered in concordance with geographic origin with some overlap
between sites. Genetic differentiation between populations was varied with
inter-island comparisons having the highest values (median FST 0.0480-0.0846). Ne
estimates were generally small (124.2-1920.3).
CONCLUSIONS: A reduced-representation SNP marker set for genome-wide An. gambiae 
genetic analysis in the north-western Lake Victoria basin is reported. Island
populations demonstrated low to moderate genetic differentiation and greater
structure suggesting some limitation to migration. Smaller estimates of Ne
indicate that an introduced effector transgene will be more susceptible to
genetic drift but to ensure that it is driven to fixation a robust gene drive
mechanism will likely be needed. These findings, together with their favourable
location and suitability for frequent monitoring, indicate that the Ssese Islands
contain several candidate field locations, which merit further evaluation as
potential GM mosquito pilot release sites.
