Human malaria parasites have complex but poorly understood population dynamics
inside their human host. In some but not all infections, parasites progress
synchronously through the 48 h lifecycle following erythrocyte invasion, such
that at any one time there is a limited spread of parasites at a particular time 
(hours) post-invasion. Patients presenting with older parasites, and with
asynchronous infections, have been reported to have higher risks of fatal
outcomes, associated with higher parasite biomass and multiplication rates
respectively. However, practical tools to assess synchrony and estimate parasite 
age post-invasion in patient samples are lacking. We have developed a novel
method based on three genes differentially expressed over the parasite
intra-erythrocytic lifecycle, and applied it to samples from patients with
uncomplicated malaria attending two health clinics in Ghana. We found that most
patients presented with synchronous infections, and with parasites within 12 h of
erythrocyte invasion. Finally we investigated if clinical features such as fever 
and parasite density could act as predictors of parasite age and synchrony. The
new method is a simple and practicable approach to study parasite dynamics in
naturally-infected patients, and is a significant improvement on the subjective
microscopical methods for parasite staging in vivo, aiding patient management.
