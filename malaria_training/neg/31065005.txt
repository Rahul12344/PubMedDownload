parasites.

Antimalarial drug resistance compels the quest for new compounds that target
alternative pathways to current drugs. The Plasmodium cyclic GMP-dependent
protein kinase (PKG) has essential functions in all of the major life cycle
developmental stages. An imidazopyridine PKG inhibitor scaffold was previously
shown to clear P. falciparum infection in a rodent model in vivo and blocked
transmission to mosquitoes providing proof of concept for this target. To find
new classes of PKG inhibitors to serve as alternative chemical starting points,
we performed a high-throughput screen of the GSK Full Diversity Collection using 
recombinant P. falciparum PKG. We developed a robust enzymatic assay in a
1536-well plate format. Promising compounds were then tested for activity against
P. falciparum asexual blood stage growth, selectivity and cytotoxicity. By using 
a scoring system we selected the 66 most promising PKG inhibitors (comprising
nine clusters and seven singletons). Among these, thiazoles were the most potent 
scaffold with mid-nanomolar activity on P. falciparum blood stage and gamete
development. Using Kinobeads profiling we identified additional P. falciparum
protein kinases targeted by the thiazoles that mediate a faster speed of the kill
than PKG-selective compounds. This scaffold represents a promising starting point
to develop a new antimalarial.
