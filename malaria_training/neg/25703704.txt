Plasmodium falciparum virulence is linked to its ability to sequester in
post-capillary venules in the human host. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is the main variant surface antigen implicated in
this process. Complete loss of parasite adhesion is linked to a large
subtelomeric deletion on chromosome 9 in a number of laboratory strains such as
D10 and T9-96. Similar to the cytoadherent reference line FCR3, D10 strain
expresses PfEMP1 on the surface of parasitized erythrocytes, however without any 
detectable cytoadhesion. To investigate which of the deleted subtelomeric genes
may be implicated in parasite adhesion, we selected 12 genes for D10
complementation studies that are predicted to code for proteins exported to the
red blood cell. We identified a novel single copy gene (PF3D7_0936500) restricted
to P. falciparum that restores adhesion to CD36, termed here virulence-associated
protein 1 (Pfvap1). Protein knockdown and gene knockout experiments confirmed a
role of PfVAP1 in the adhesion process in FCR3 parasites. PfVAP1 is co-exported
with PfEMP1 into the host cell via vesicle-like structures called Maurer's
clefts. This study identifies a novel highly conserved parasite molecule that
contributes to parasite virulence possibly by assisting PfEMP1 to establish
functional adhesion at the host cell surface.
