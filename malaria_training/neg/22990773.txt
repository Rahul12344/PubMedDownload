Gene manipulation is an invaluable tool to investigate and understand the biology
of an organism. Although this technology has been applied to both the human and
rodent malarial parasites (RMP), Plasmodium berghei in particular offers a more
robust system due to a higher and more efficient transformation rate. Here, we
describe a comprehensive transfection and selection protocol using P. berghei
including a variant negative selection protocol administering 5-fluorocytosine to
the animals in drinking water. Additionally, we discuss and assess the latest
advances in gene manipulation technologies developed in RMP to gain a better
understanding of Plasmodium biology.
