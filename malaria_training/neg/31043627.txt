Ornithodoros rostratus is a South American argasid tick which importance relies
on its itchy bite and potential as disease vector. They feed on a wide variety of
hosts and secrete different molecules in their saliva and intestinal content that
counteract host defences and help to accommodate and metabolize the relatively
large quantity of blood upon feeding. The present work describes the
transcriptome profile of salivary gland (SG) and midgut (MG) of O. rostratus
using Illumina sequencing. A total of 8,031 contigs were assembled and assigned
to different functional classes. Secreted proteins were the most abundant in the 
SG and accounted for ~67% of all expressed transcripts with contigs with identity
to lipocalins and acid tail proteins being the most representative. On the other 
hand, immunity genes were upregulated in MG with a predominance of defensins and 
lysozymes. Only 10 transcripts in SG and 8 in MG represented ~30% of all RNA
expressed in each tissue and one single contig (the acid tail protein ORN-9707)
represented ~7% of all expressed contigs in SG. Results highlight the functional 
difference of each organ and identified the most expressed classes and contigs of
O. rostratus SG and MG.
