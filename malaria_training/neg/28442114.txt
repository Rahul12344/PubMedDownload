OBJECTIVE: To develop a new technique for diagnosis of Plasmodium knowlesi and at
the same time to be able to discriminate among the diverse species of Plasmodium 
causing human malaria.
METHODS: In this study the nested multiplex malaria PCR was redesigned, targeting
the 18S rRNA gene, to identify the fifth human Plasmodium species, Plasmodium
knowlesi, together with the other human Plasmodium (Plasmodium falciparum,
Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae) by amplified fragment
size using only two amplification processes and including an internal reaction
control to avoid false negatives.
RESULTS: The technique was validated with 91 clinical samples obtained from
patients with malaria compatible symptoms. The technique showed high sensitivity 
(100%) and specificity (96%) when it was compared to the reference method
employed for malaria diagnosis in the Instituto de Salud Carlos Ⅲ and a published
real-time PCR malaria assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The technique designed is an economical, sensitive and specific
alternative to current diagnosis methods. Furthermore, the method might be tested
in knowlesi-malaria endemic areas with a higher number of samples to confirm the 
quality of the method.
