Fusion of the last two enzymes in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the
inversed order by having a COOH-terminal orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT)
and an NH2-terminal orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), as
OMPDC-OPRT, are described in many organisms. Here, we produced gene fusions of
Plasmodium falciparum OMPDC-OPRT and expressed the bifunctional protein in
Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using affinity and
anion-exchange chromatography, exhibited enzymatic activities and functioned as a
dimer. The activities, although unstable, were stabilized by its substrate and
product during purification and long-term storage. Furthermore, the enzyme
expressed a perfect catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The kcat was selectively
enhanced up to three orders of magnitude, while the Km was not much affected and 
remained at low μM levels when compared to the monofunctional enzymes. The fusion
of the two enzymes, creating a "super-enzyme" with perfect catalytic power and
more flexibility, reflects cryptic relationship of enzymatic reactivities and
metabolic functions on molecular evolution.
