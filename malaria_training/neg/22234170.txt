Plasmodial bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) is
a validated antimalarial drug target. In this study, expression of the putative
dhfr-ts of Plasmodium ovale rescued the DHFR chemical knockout and a TS null
bacterial strain, demonstrating its DHFR and TS catalytic functions. PoDHFR-TS
was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and affinity purified by
Methotrexate Sepharose column. Biochemical and enzyme kinetics characterizations 
indicated that PoDHFR-TS is similar to other plasmodial enzymes, albeit with
lower catalytic activity but better tolerance of acidic pH. Importantly, the
PoDHFR from Thai isolate EU266602 remains sensitive to the antimalarials
pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, in contrast to P. falciparum and P. vivax isolates
where resistance to these drugs is widespread.
