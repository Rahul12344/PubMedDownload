BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphism is an inevitable component of a multistage
infectious organism, such as the malaria parasite. By means of genetic
polymorphism, parasite opts particular polymorph and reveals survival advantage. 
Pvs25 and pvs28 are sexual stage antigen genes, expressed at the ookinete stage
inside the mosquito gut, and considered as potential transmission-blocking
vaccine candidates. This study presents sequence variations in two important
transmission blocking antigen genes pvs25 and pvs28 in the field isolates of P.
vivax from the Indian subcontinent.
METHODS: One hundred microscopically diagnosed P. vivax isolates were collected
from five geographical regions of India. Pvs25 and pvs28 genes were PCR amplified
and sequenced to assess sequence variation among field isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 26 amino acid substitutions were observed in Pvs25 (10) and
Pvs28 (16) among field isolates of P. vivax. Tandem repeat polymorphism observed 
in pvs28 shows 3-6 tandem repeats in the field isolates. Seven and eight novel
amino acid substitutions were observed in Pvs25 and Pvs28, respectively in Indian
isolates. Comparison of amino acid substitutions suggests that majority of
substitutions observed in global isolates were also present in Indian
subcontinent. A single haplotype was observed to be major haplotype among
isolates of Delhi, Nadiad, Chennai and Panna except in isolates of Kamrup.
Further, population comparison analyses suggest that P. vivax isolates inhabiting
in north-eastern region (Kamrup) were distantly related with the isolates from
remaining parts of the country. Majority of the amino acid substitutions observed
in Indian isolates were more identical to the substitutions reported from
isolates of Thailand and Bangladesh.
CONCLUSION: Study uncovered many new amino acid substitutions as well as a
predominance of single haplotype in Indian subcontinent except in north-eastern
region of the country. The amino acid substitutions data generated in this study 
from different geographical regions of the Indian subcontinent could be helpful
in designing a more effective anti-malarial transmission-blocking vaccine.
