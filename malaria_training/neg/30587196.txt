BACKGROUND: The emergence and transnational spread of artemisinin resistance in
Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) is a serious threat 
to malaria elimination in the region and could present a threat to malaria
control in Africa. Recently, the Lao Government adopted the goal of malaria
elimination by 2030, for which monitoring of artemisinin-resistant malaria within
the country is indispensable. This study's objectives were to assess the
distribution of k13 mutations in Laos.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates (n = 1151) were collected from five
southern provinces in Laos between 2015 and 2016, and three isolates from the
northernmost province bordering China in 2017. Polymorphisms of the k13 gene and 
two flanking regions were analysed to estimate relationship among the isolates.
RESULTS: In the five southern provinces, overall 55.5% of the isolates possessed 
artemisinin-resistant mutations of the k13 gene (C580Y, P574L, R539T, Y493H). The
C580Y was the predominant mutation (87.2%). The frequencies of the k13 mutations 
were heterogeneous in the five southern provinces, but with a clear tendency
showing the highest frequency in the south (72.5%) and to a lower degree when
moving northward (28.0%). The three isolates from the Lao-Chinese border also
possessed the C580Y mutation. Analysis of the flanking loci demonstrated that
these three isolates were genetically very close to resistant strains originating
from western Cambodia.
CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinin resistance was observed to be rapidly increasing and
spreading northwards through Laos and has now reached the Chinese border. The Lao
and Chinese governments, as well as the international community, should make
dedicated efforts to contain the spread of k13 mutations within Laos and in the
GMS.
