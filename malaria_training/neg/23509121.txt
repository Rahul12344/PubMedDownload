This study deals with the underlying causes of failure of chloroquine in the
treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in some malaria-endemic regions of
India. Samples were collected from 141 patients in Purulia from March of 2007 to 
April of 2008. In vitro drug susceptibility tests, parasitic DNA isolation
followed by polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment-length
polymorphisms of different codons of the pfcrt gene (76) and pfmdr-I genes (86,
1042, and 1246) were assessed. The responses of 141 patients to chloroquine were 
determined. Prevalence of double pfmdr-I (58.16%) mutation (86Y+1246Y) and some
(14.89%) single pfcrt mutations with triple pfmdr-I mutation
(76T+86Y+1042D+1246Y) were found. Interestingly, double pfmdr-I mutation (86Y and
1246Y codons) was observed with the early treatment failure cases. These results 
show, for the first time in India that in vitro chloroquine resistance and in
vivo chloroquine treatment failure were caused by double pfmdr-I (P < 0.001)
mutation.
