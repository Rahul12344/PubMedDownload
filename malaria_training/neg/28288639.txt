BACKGROUND: Non-human primates, such as the rhesus macaques, are the preferred
model for down-selecting human malaria vaccine formulations, but the rhesus model
is expensive and does not allow for direct efficacy testing of human malaria
vaccines. Transgenic rodent parasites expressing genes of human Plasmodium are
now routinely used for efficacy studies of human malaria vaccines. Mice have
however rarely predicted success in human malaria trials and there is scepticism 
whether mouse studies alone are sufficient to move a vaccine candidate into the
clinic.
METHODS: A comparison of immunogenicity, fine-specificity and functional activity
of two Alum-adjuvanted Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based
vaccines was conducted in mouse and rhesus models. One vaccine was a soluble
recombinant protein (CSP) and the other was the same CSP covalently conjugated to
the Qβ phage particle (Qβ-CSP).
RESULTS: Mice showed different kinetics of antibody responses and different
sensitivity to the NANP-repeat and N-terminal epitopes as compared to rhesus.
While mice failed to discern differences between the protective efficacy of CSP
versus Qβ-CSP vaccine following direct challenge with transgenic Plasmodium
berghei parasites, rhesus serum from the Qβ-CSP-vaccinated animals induced higher
in vivo sporozoite neutralization activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite some immunologic parallels between models, these data
demonstrate that differences between the immune responses induced in the two
models risk conflicting decisions regarding potential vaccine utility in humans. 
In combination with historical observations, the data presented here suggest that
although murine models may be useful for some purposes, non-human primate models 
may be more likely to predict the human response to investigational vaccines.
