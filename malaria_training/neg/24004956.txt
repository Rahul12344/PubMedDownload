The geographical distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the
mitochondrial genome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was
investigated. We identified 88 SNPs in 516 isolates from seven parasite
populations in Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Analysis of the SNPs
postulated a sub-Saharan African origin and recovered a strong negative
correlation between within-population SNP diversity and geographic distance from 
the putative African origin over Southeast Asia and Oceania. These results are
consistent with those previously obtained for nuclear genome-encoded housekeeping
genes, indicating that the pattern of inheritance does not substantially affect
the geographical distribution of SNPs.
