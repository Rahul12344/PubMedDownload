Background: Pediatric acute respiratory distress in tropical settings is very
common. Bacterial pneumonia is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality
rates and requires adequate diagnosis for correct treatment. A rapid test that
could identify bacterial (vs other) infections would have great clinical utility.
Methods and Results: We performed RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing and analyzed the
transcriptomes of 68 pediatric patients with well-characterized clinical
phenotype to identify transcriptional features associated with each disease
class. We refined the features to predictive models (support vector machine,
elastic net) and validated those models in an independent test set of 37 patients
(80%-85% accuracy).
Conclusions: We have identified sets of genes that are differentially expressed
in pediatric patients with pneumonia syndrome attributable to different
infections and requiring different therapeutic interventions. Findings of this
study demonstrate that human transcription signatures in infected patients
recapitulate the underlying biology and provide models for predicting a bacterial
diagnosis to inform treatment.
