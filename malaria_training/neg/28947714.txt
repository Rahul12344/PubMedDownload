The apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) of Plasmodium spp. is a merozoite surface
antigen that is essential for the recognition and invasion of erythrocytes.
Polymorphisms occurring in this surface antigen will cause major obstacles in
developing effective malaria vaccines based on AMA-1. The objective of this study
was to characterize ama1 gene in Plasmodium knowlesi isolates from Sabah. DNA was
extracted from blood samples collected from Keningau, Kota Kinabalu and Kudat.
The Pkama1 gene was amplified using nested PCR and subjected to bidirectional
sequencing. Analysis of DNA sequence revealed that most of the nucleotide
polymorphisms were synonymous and concentrated in domain I of PkAMA-1. Forteen
haplotypes were identified based on amino acid variations and haplotype K5 was
the most common haplotype. dN/dS ratios implied that purifying selection was
prevalent in Pkama1 gene. Fu and Li's D and F values further provided evidence of
negative selection acting on domain II of Pkama1. Lownucleotide diversitywas also
detected for the Pkama1 sequences,which is similar to reports on Pkama1 from
Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. The presence of purifying selection and low
nucleotide diversity indicated that domain II of Pkama1 can be used as a target
for vaccine development.
