Malaria is largely a preventable and curable disease. However, a delay or an
inappropriate treatment can result in serious adverse outcomes for patient.
Rapid, simple and cost-effective diagnostic tests that can be easily adapted and 
rapidly scaled-up at the field or community levels are needed. In this study,
accelerated detection methods for the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium
vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase were developed based on
the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. The developed methods
included the use of species-specific biotinylated primers to amplify LAMP
amplicons, which were then hybridized to specific FITC-labeled DNA probes and
visualized on a chromatographic lateral flow dipstick (LFD). The total LAMP-LFD
assay time was approximately 1.5h. The LAMP-LFD assays showed similar detection
limit to conventional PCR assay when performed on plasmid DNA carrying the
malaria dhfr-ts genes. The LAMP-LFD showed 10 folds higher detection limit than
PCR when performed on genomic DNA samples from Pf and Pv parasites. The dhfr-ts
LAMP-LFD assays also have the advantages of reduced assay time and easy format
for interpretation of results.
