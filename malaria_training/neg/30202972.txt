Background: Detection of Plasmodium antigens provides evidence of malaria
infection status and is the basis for most malaria diagnosis.
Methods: We developed a sensitive bead-based multiplex assay for laboratory use, 
which simultaneously detects pan-Plasmodium aldolase (pAldo), pan-Plasmodium
lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)
antigens. The assay was validated against purified recombinant antigens,
monospecies malaria infections, and noninfected blood samples. To test against
samples collected in an endemic setting, Angolan outpatient samples (n = 1267)
were assayed.
Results: Of 466 Angolan samples positive for at least 1 antigen, the most common 
antigen profiles were PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH+ (167, 36%), PfHRP2+/pAldo-/pLDH- (163,
35%), and PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH- (129, 28%). Antigen profile was predictive of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and parasite density. Eight Angolan
samples (1.7%) had no or very low PfHRP2 but were positive for 1 or both of the
other antigens. PCR analysis confirmed 3 (0.6%) were P. ovale infections and 2
(0.4%) represented P. falciparum parasites lacking Pfhrp2 and/or Pfhrp3.
Conclusions: These are the first reports of Pfhrp2/3 deletion mutants in Angola. 
High-throughput multiplex antigen detection can inexpensively screen for
low-density P. falciparum, non-falciparum, and Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites to
provide population-level antigen estimates and identify specimens requiring
further molecular characterization.
