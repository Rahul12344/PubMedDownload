Human onchocerciasis is a serious neglected tropical disease caused by the
filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus that can lead to blindness and chronic
disability. Control of the disease relies largely on mass administration of a
single drug, and the development of new drugs and vaccines depends on a better
knowledge of parasite biology. Here, we describe the chromosomes of O. volvulus
and its Wolbachia endosymbiont. We provide the highest-quality sequence assembly 
for any parasitic nematode to date, giving a glimpse into the evolution of
filarial parasite chromosomes and proteomes. This resource was used to
investigate gene families with key functions that could be potentially exploited 
as targets for future drugs. Using metabolic reconstruction of the nematode and
its endosymbiont, we identified enzymes that are likely to be essential for O.
volvulus viability. In addition, we have generated a list of proteins that could 
be targeted by Federal-Drug-Agency-approved but repurposed drugs, providing
starting points for anti-onchocerciasis drug development.
