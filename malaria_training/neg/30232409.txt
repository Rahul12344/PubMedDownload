During blood stage development the malaria parasite resides in a membrane-bound
compartment, termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The reasons for this
intravacuolar life style and the molecular functions of this parasite-specific
compartment remain poorly defined, which is mainly due to our limited knowledge
about the molecular make-up of this unique niche. We used an in silico
down-scaling approach to select for Plasmodium-specific candidates that harbour
signatures of PV residency. Live co-localisation of five endogenously tagged
proteins confirmed expression in the PV of Plasmodium berghei blood and liver
stages. ER retention was ruled out by addition of the respective carboxyterminal 
tetrapeptides to a secreted reporter protein. Although all five PV proteins are
highly expressed, four proved to be dispensable for parasite development in the
mammalian and mosquito host, as revealed by targeted gene deletion. In good
agreement with their redundant roles, the knockout parasites displayed no
detectable deficiencies in protein export, sequestration, or PV morphology.
Together, our approach improved the catalogue of the Plasmodium PV proteome and
provides experimental genetics evidence for functional redundancy of several PV
proteins.
