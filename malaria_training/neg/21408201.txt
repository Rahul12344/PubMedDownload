Many pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and protozoa achieve chronic infection through
an immune evasion strategy known as antigenic variation. In the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, this involves transcriptional switching among
members of the var gene family, causing parasites with different antigenic and
phenotypic characteristics to appear at different times within a population. Here
we use a genome-wide approach to explore this process in vitro within a set of
cloned parasite populations. Our analyses reveal a non-random, highly structured 
switch pathway where an initially dominant transcript switches via a set of
switch-intermediates either to a new dominant transcript, or back to the
original. We show that this specific pathway can arise through an evolutionary
conflict in which the pathogen has to optimise between safeguarding its limited
antigenic repertoire and remaining capable of establishing infections in
non-na√Øve individuals. Our results thus demonstrate a crucial role for structured
switching during the early phases of infections and provide a unifying theory of 
antigenic variation in P. falciparum malaria as a balanced process of
parasite-intrinsic switching and immune-mediated selection.
