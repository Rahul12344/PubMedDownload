The lack of mechanistic explanations for many genotype-phenotype associations
identified by GWAS precludes thorough assessment of their impact on human health.
Here, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analysis
in erythroblasts and found erythroid-specific eQTLs for ATP2B4, the main calcium 
ATPase of red blood cells (rbc). The same SNPs were previously associated with
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and susceptibility to severe
malaria infection. We showed that Atp2b4-/- mice demonstrate increased MCHC,
confirming ATP2B4 as the causal gene at this GWAS locus. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we
fine mapped the genetic signal to an erythroid-specific enhancer of ATP2B4.
Erythroid cells with a deletion of the ATP2B4 enhancer had abnormally high
intracellular calcium levels. These results illustrate the power of combined
transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genome-editing approaches in characterizing
noncoding regulatory elements in phenotype-relevant cells. Our study supports
ATP2B4 as a potential target for modulating rbc hydration in erythroid disorders 
and malaria infection.
