Babesia gibsoni (B. gibsoni), an intracellular apicomplexan protozoan, poses
great threat to canine health. Currently, little information is available about
the B. gibsoni (WH58) endemic to Wuhan, China. Here, the mitochondrial (mt)
genome of B. gibsoni (WH58) was amplified by five pairs of primers and sequenced 
and annotated by alignment with the reported mt genome sequences of Babesia canis
(B. canis, KC207822), Babesia orientalis (KF218819), Babesia bovis (AB499088),
and Theileria equi (AB499091). The evolutionary relationships were analyzed with 
the amino acid sequences of cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) and cytochrome b (cob) 
genes in apicomplexan parasite species. Additionally, the mt genomes of Babesia, 
Theileria, and Plasmodium spp. were compared in size, host infection, form,
distribution, and direction of the protein-coding genes. The full size of the mt 
genome of B. gibsoni (WH58) was 5865 bp with a linear form, containing
terminal-inverted repeats on both ends, six large subunit ribosomal RNA
fragments, and three protein-coding genes: cox1, cob, and cytochrome c oxidase
III (cox3). Babesia, Theileria, and Plasmodium spp. had a similar mt genome size 
of about 6000 bp. The mt genomes of parasites that cause canine babesiosis showed
a slightly smaller size than the other species. Moreover, Babesia microti (R1
strain) was about 11,100 bp in size, which was twice larger than that of the
other species. The mt form was linear for Babesia and Theileria spp. but circular
for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi. Additionally, all the species 
contained the three protein-coding genes of cox1, cox3, and cob except Toxoplasma
gondii (RH strain) which only contained the cox1 and cob genes. The phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that B. gibsoni (WH58) was more identical to B. gibsoni
(AB499087), B. canis (KC207822), and Babesia rossi (KC207823) and most divergent 
from Babesia conradae in Babesia spp. Despite the highest similarity to B.
gibsoni (AB499087) reported in Japan, B. gibsoni (WH58) showed notable
differences in the sequence of nucleotides and amino acids and the property in
virulence to host and in vitro cultivation. This study compared the mt genomes of
the two B. gibsoni isolates and other parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa and
provided new insights into their differences and evolutionary relationships.
