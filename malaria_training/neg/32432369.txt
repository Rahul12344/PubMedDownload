Reticulon and REEP family of proteins stabilize the high curvature of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) tubules. Plasmodium berghei Yop1 (PbYop1) is a REEP5 homolog in
Plasmodium. Here, we characterize its function using a gene-knockout (Pbyop1∆).
Pbyop1∆ asexual stage parasites display abnormal ER architecture and an enlarged 
digestive vacuole. The erythrocytic cycle of Pbyop1∆ parasites is severely
attenuated and the incidence of experimental cerebral malaria is significantly
decreased in Pbyop1∆-infected mice. Pbyop1∆ sporozoites have reduced speed, are
slower to invade host cells but give rise to equal numbers of infected HepG2
cells, as WT sporozoites. We propose that PbYOP1's disruption may lead to defects
in trafficking and secretion of a subset of proteins required for parasite
development and invasion of erythrocytes. Furthermore, the maintenance of ER
morphology in different parasite stages is likely to depend on different
proteins.
