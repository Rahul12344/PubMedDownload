In the last years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been established as important
post-transcriptional regulators of critical physiological processes in animals
and plants. Here, we summarize what is known about miRNA biosynthesis, expression
and function in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae with a particular
emphasis on the mosquito-parasite interactions. We discuss the important gaps in 
the current knowledge, including the potential of miRNA manipulation for future
vector control strategies.
