Existing theory on competition for hosts between pathogen strains has proposed
that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of strain structure consisting 
of discrete, weakly overlapping antigenic repertoires. This prediction of strain 
theory has conceptual overlap with fundamental ideas in ecology on niche
partitioning and limiting similarity between coexisting species in an ecosystem, 
which oppose the hypothesis of neutral coexistence. For Plasmodium falciparum,
strain theory has been specifically proposed in relation to the major surface
antigen of the blood stage, known as PfEMP1 and encoded by the multicopy
multigene family known as the var genes. Deep sampling of the DBLα domain of var 
genes in the local population of Bakoumba, West Africa, was completed to define
whether patterns of repertoire overlap support a role of immune selection under
the opposing force of high outcrossing, a characteristic of areas of intense
malaria transmission. Using a 454 high-throughput sequencing protocol, we report 
extremely high diversity of the DBLα domain and a large parasite population with 
DBLα repertoires structured into nonrandom patterns of overlap. Such population
structure, significant for the high diversity of var genes that compose it at a
local level, supports the existence of "strains" characterized by distinct var
gene repertoires. Nonneutral, frequency-dependent competition would be at play
and could underlie these patterns. With a computational experiment that simulates
an intervention similar to mass drug administration, we argue that the observed
repertoire structure matters for the antigenic var diversity of the parasite
population remaining after intervention.
