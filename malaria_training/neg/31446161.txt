Artesunate (ART), a derivative of artemisinin, is a medication to treat malaria. 
Beyond that, the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities of ART have
been identified in autoimmune diseases. However, whether ART functions in
psoriasis-like dermatitis induced by imiquimod (IMQ, a TLR7/8 agonist) is
currently unkown. There, we found that the cumulative score, epidermal thickening
and expression of Ki-67 of ART-treated BALB/c mice were significantly lower than 
those in the IMQ psoriatic model group. In addition, ART treatment ameliorated
mice from systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, ART reduced γδ T cells in
draining lymph nodes, which might be benefit the improvement of dermatitis. These
findings suggested that ART could be a promising drug of psoriasis in clinic.
