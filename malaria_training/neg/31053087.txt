BACKGROUND: The thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) was first
discovered in the sporozoite of Plasmodium falciparum and TRAP family proteins
are secreted by micronemes and transported to the parasite surface to participate
in the invasion process. Various TRAP proteins have been identified in
apicomplexan protozoans, but there have been few reports about TRAP proteins in
Babesia orientalis.
METHODS: The functional domain of TRAP2 in B. orientalis was cloned, sequenced,
characterized and compared to the TRAP sequences of related apicomplexan
parasites. The functional domain of BoTRAP2 was truncated, named BoTRAP2-1, and
then cloned into the pET-28a expression vector. Rabbit anti-rBoTRAP2-1 polyclonal
antibody was produced by immunizing three rabbits. Western blot analysis was used
to identify the native form and immunogenicity of BoTRAP2. The localization of
BoTRAP2 was identified by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA).
RESULTS: The amplified genes of BoTRAP2 are 2817 bp in length, encoding a
functional domain of about 938 aa with two vWFA domains, one TSP domain and one
transmembrane domain. The amino acid sequence of BoTRAP2 has a high similarity
with that of B. bovis and B. gibsoni. The predicted tertiary structure of
truncated BoTRAP2-1 confirmed that BoTRAP2 contains two vWFA domains and a TSP
domain, the main functional areas of the protein. The native BoTRAP2 was
identified from B. orientalis lysate by using rabbit polyclonal anti-rBoTRAP2-1. 
A band corresponding to rBoTRAP2-1 was detected by reaction with serum from a B. 
orientalis-infected water buffalo, indicating that the protein has a high
immunogenicity. IFA showed that BoTRAP2 is mainly localized on the apical end of 
parasites by rabbit anti-rBoTRAP2-1 polyclonal serum.
CONCLUSIONS: The rBoTRAP2 could differentiate serum from B. orientalis-infected
water buffalo and normal water buffalo, implicating that BoTRAP2 has high
immunogenicity and could serve as a candidate antigen for diagnosis of B.
orientalis infection in buffalo.
