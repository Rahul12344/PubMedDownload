Malaria has become an emerging infection in Greece, which is the doorstep to
Europe for thousands of immigrants. With increasing immigration, cases with
evidence of domestic transmission (autochthonous) are being reported. In the
present study, an isolate of Plasmodium vivax from an autochthonous clinical case
was subjected to phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the merozoite
surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). In the MSP
region, the strain was related with strains from Brazil, South Korea, Turkey and 
Thailand, whereas in the CSP region, with strains from Brazil, Colombia and New
Guinea. The present study establishes for the first time in Greece the basis for 
the creation of a database comprising genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics 
of Plasmodium spp.
