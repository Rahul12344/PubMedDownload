Dendritic cells (DC) targeting vaccines require high efficiency for uptake,
followed by DC activation and maturation. We used magnetic vectors comprising
polyethylenimine (PEI)-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, with
hyaluronic acid (HA) of different molecular weights (<10 and 900â€‰kDa) to reduce
cytotoxicity and to facilitate endocytosis of particles into DCs via specific
surface receptors. DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein 1-19 
and a plasmid encoding yellow fluorescent gene were added to the magnetic
complexes with various % charge ratios of HA: PEI. The presence of magnetic
fields significantly enhanced DC transfection and maturation. Vectors containing 
a high-molecular-weight HA with 100% charge ratio of HA: PEI yielded a better
transfection efficiency than others. This phenomenon was attributed to their
longer molecular chains and higher mucoadhesive properties aiding DNA
condensation and stability. Insights gained should improve the design of more
effective DNA vaccine delivery systems.
