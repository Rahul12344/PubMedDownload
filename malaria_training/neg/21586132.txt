BACKGROUND: Malaria still represents a significant public health problem in
China, and the cases dramatically increased in Central China after 2001.
Antifolate resistance in Plasmodium vivax is caused by point mutations in genes
encoding dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps). 
In this study, we used direct sequencing to investigate genetic variation in
pvdhfr of malaria patients' samples from Central China.
RESULTS: Among all the samples, 21.4% were wild-type, whereas mutations were
detected at three codons (58, 61 and 117) including single mutant (34.6%) and
double mutants (43.8%). The most prevalent mutant allele was the one with double 
mutation at codons 58 and 117 (24.6%). Three types of single mutation (S58R, T61M
and S117N) were found in 2.1%, 11.8% and 20.9% of parasite isolates,
respectively. The four P. vivax parasite populations in Central China also
differed in pvdhfr allele frequencies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that P. vivax in Central China may be
relatively susceptible to pyrimethamine. And it also highlights genotyping in the
pvdhfr genes remains a useful tool to monitor the emergence and spread of P.
vivax pyrimethamine resistance.
