BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms within the PfATP6 gene have been indicated as potential
molecular markers for artemisinin efficacy. Since 2004, the use of artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT) was introduced as first-line treatment of the
uncomplicated malaria cases in Suriname. The aim of this research was to
determine changes in Suriname in the status of the polymorphic markers in the
PfATP6 gene before and after the adoption of the ACT-regimen, particularly of the
S769N mutation, which was reported to be associated with in vitro Artemether
resistance in the neighboring country French Guiana.
METHODS: The PfATP6 gene from Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Suriname was
investigated in 28 samples using PCR amplification and restriction enzyme
analysis, to assess and determine the prevalence of potentially interesting
single nucleotide polymorphisms. The polymorphisms [L263E; A623E; S769N], which
may be associated with the artemisinin resistant phenotype were characterized in 
parasites from three endemic regions before and after the adoption of the
ACT-regimen. In addition, the status of these molecular markers was compared in
paired P. falciparum isolates from patients with recurring malaria after
controlled ACT.
RESULTS: All the investigated samples exhibit the wild-type genotype at all three
positions; L263, A623, S769.
CONCLUSION: All investigated isolates before and after the adoption of the
ACT-regimen and independent of endemic region harbored the wild-type genotype for
the three investigated polymorphisms. The study revealed that decreased
artemisinin susceptibility could occur independent from PfATP6 mutations,
challenging the assumption that artemisinin resistance is associated with these
mutations in the PfATP6 gene.
