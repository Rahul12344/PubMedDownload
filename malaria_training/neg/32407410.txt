Only a small fraction of the antigens expressed by malaria parasites have been
evaluated as vaccine candidates. A successful malaria subunit vaccine will likely
require multiple antigenic targets to achieve broad protection with high
protective efficacy. Here we describe protective efficacy of a novel antigen,
Plasmodium yoelii (Py) E140 (PyE140), evaluated against P. yoelii challenge of
mice. Vaccines targeting PyE140 reproducibly induced up to 100% sterile
protection in both inbred and outbred murine challenge models. Although PyE140
immunization induced high frequency and multifunctional CD8+ T cell responses, as
well as CD4+ T cell responses, protection was mediated by PyE140 antibodies
acting against blood stage parasites. Protection in mice was long-lasting with up
to 100% sterile protection at twelve weeks post-immunization and durable high
titer anti-PyE140 antibodies. The E140 antigen is expressed in all Plasmodium
species, is highly conserved in both P. falciparum lab-adapted strains and
endemic circulating parasites, and is thus a promising lead vaccine candidate for
future evaluation against human malaria parasite species.

Conflict of interest statement: The authors have read the journalâ€™s policy and
have the following conflicts: ECS, KJL, and JCA are named inventors on a patent
application US PCT/US18/25510 covering methods and compositions for vaccinating
against malaria. JCA is a named inventor on US patent number 10, 195, 260, US
Patent Application No. 16/230,512, and related foreign applications covering the 
PfE140 antigen. NR, KO, JW, and JCA are/were employed by CAMRIS International,
which is a commercial company that owns the rights to the PfE140 antigen under
patent number 10, 195, 260. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE
