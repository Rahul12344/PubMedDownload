Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are a group of natural killer
cell receptors (NKRs) that regulate NK-cell-mediated production of interferon
gamma (IFN-γ) in response to infection. These receptors have recently been
suggested to influence the severity of clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria
infection. We examined the KIR locus in relation to malaria in children from
southwest Nigeria. Sequence specific priming (SSP)-PCR was used to detect the KIR
genes. The presence or absence of fifteen different KIR genes was determined in
each individual and the proportions compared across 3 clinical groups;
asymptomatic malaria, uncomplicated clinical malaria and severe clinical malaria.
The genes KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3 and KIR2DS5 were present in a significantly higher
proportion of individuals in the asymptomatic control group than in the malaria
cases. Furthermore, KIR2DS3 and KIR2DS5 were present in a higher proportion of
uncomplicated malaria cases than severe malaria cases. Carriage c-AB2 genotype
(which comprises all centromeric KIR genes including KIR2DL5, KIR2DS3 and
KIR2DS5) decreases with severity of the disease suggesting that the KIR AB
profile might be associated with protection from severe malaria infection in this
population in Nigeria.
