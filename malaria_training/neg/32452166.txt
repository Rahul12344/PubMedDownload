Reef-building corals live in a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic algae
(family Symbiodiniaceae) that usually provide most of the energy required by the 
coral host. This relationship is sensitive to temperature stress; as little as a 
1°C increase often leads to the collapse of the association. This sensitivity has
led to an interest in the potential of more stress-tolerant algae to supplement
or substitute for the normal Symbiodiniaceae mutualists. In this respect, the
apicomplexan-like microalga Chromera is of particular interest due to its greater
temperature tolerance. We generated a de novo transcriptome for a Chromera strain
isolated from a GBR coral ('GBR Chromera') and compared with those of the
reference strain of Chromera ('Sydney Chromera'), and to those of Symbiodiniaceae
(Fugacium kawagutii, Cladocopium goreaui and Breviolum minutum), as well as the
apicomplexan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. In contrast to the high sequence
divergence amongst representatives of different genera within the family
Symbiodiniaceae, the two Chromera strains featured low sequence divergence at
orthologous genes, implying that they are likely to be conspecifics. Although
KEGG categories provide few criteria by which true coral mutualists might be
identified, they do supply a molecular rationalization that explains the
ecological dominance of Cladocopium spp. amongst Indo-Pacific reef corals. The
presence of HSP20 genes may contribute to the high thermal tolerance of Chromera.
