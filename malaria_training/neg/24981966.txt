BACKGROUND: In the Arabian Peninsula malaria control is progressing steadily,
backed by adequate logistic and political support. As a result, transmission has 
been interrupted throughout the region, with exception of limited sites in Yemen 
and Saudi Arabia. Here we examined Plasmodium falciparum parasites in these sites
to assess if the above success has limited diversity and gene flow.
METHODS: We examined 108 P. falciparum isolates in three sites in Yemen (Taiz,
Dhamar and Hodeidah) and 91 isolates from Saudi Arabia (Jazan). Nine
microsatellites were analyzed for allelic diversity, multi-locus haplotype and
inter-population differentiation.
RESULTS: Diversity at each locus (unbiased heterozygosity [H]) was relatively
lower in Yemen; (Hodeidah, H=0.615, Taiz, H=0.66, Dhamar, H=0.481), compared to
Saudi Arabia (Jazan, H=0.76). Microsatellites were distributed widely and private
alleles, detected in a single population, were rare. Pairwise comparisons
revealed that parasites population in Dhamar was relatively distanced (FST=0.19).
However, Taiz (Yemen) (FST=0.065) and Hodeidah (FST=0.107) populations were
closer to that in Jazan (Saudi Arabia). Nonetheless, parasites in the four sites 
can be considered as one population.
CONCLUSION: Although malaria risk in Saudi Arabia has been cut considerably, the 
extent of diversity and parasite genetic structure are indicative of a large
population size. Elimination strategy should target demographic factors that
favor parasite dispersal and flow of imported malaria.
