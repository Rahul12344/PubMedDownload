BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria infection is suspected to cause
endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (eBL), but the evidence remains unsettled. An inverse
relationship between sickle cell trait (SCT) and eBL, which supports that between
malaria and eBL, has been reported before, but in small studies with low power.
We investigated this hypothesis in children in a population-based study in
northern Uganda using Mendelian Randomization.
METHODS: Malaria-related polymorphisms (SCT, IL10, IL1A, CD36, SEMA3C, and
IFNAR1) were genotyped in 202 eBL cases and 624 controls enrolled during
2010-2015. We modeled associations between genotypes and eBL or malaria using
logistic regression.
FINDINGS: SCT was associated with decreased risk of eBL (adjusted odds ratio [OR]
0·37, 95% CI 0·21-0·66; p=0·0003). Decreased risk of eBL was associated with IL10
rs1800896-CT (OR 0·73, 95% CI 0·50-1·07) and -CC genotypes (OR 0·53, 95% CI
0·29-0·95, ptrend=0·019); IL1A rs2856838-AG (OR 0·56, 95% CI 0·39-0·81) and -AA
genotype (OR 0·50, 95% CI 0·28-1·01, ptrend=0·0016); and SEMA3C rs4461841-CT or
-CC genotypes (OR 0·57, 95% CI 0·35-0·93, p=0·0193). SCT and IL10 rs1800896, IL1A
rs2856838, but not SEMA3C rs4461841, polymorphisms were associated with decreased
risk of malaria in the controls.
INTERPRETATION: Our results support a causal effect of malaria infection on eBL.
