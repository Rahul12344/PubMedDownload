BACKGROUND: The male gamete fertilization factor P48/45 in malaria parasites is a
prime transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) candidate. Efforts to develop
antimalarial vaccines are often thwarted by genetic diversity of the target
antigens. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity of Pvs48/45 gene in global
Plasmodium vivax populations.
METHODS: We determined 200 Pvs48/45 sequences collected from temperate and
subtropical parasite populations in China. Population genetic and evolutionary
analyses were performed to determine the levels of genetic diversity, potential
signature of selection, and population differentiation.
RESULTS: Analysis of the Pvs48/45 sequences from 200 P. vivax parasites collected
in a temperate and a tropical region revealed a low level of genetic diversity
(π = 0.0012) with 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 11 were
nonsynonymous. Analysis of 344 Pvs48/45 sequences from nine worldwide P. vivax
populations detected a total of 38 haplotypes, of which 13 haplotypes were
present only once. Multiple tests for selection confirmed a signature of positive
selection on Pvs48/45 with selection skewed to the second cysteine domain.
Haplotype network analysis and Wright's fixation index showed large geographical 
differentiation with the presence of continent-or region-specific mutations in
this gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Pvs48/45 displays low levels of genetic diversity with the presence 
of region-specific mutations. Some of the mutations may be potential epitope
targets based on their positions in the predicted structure, highlighting the
need for future evaluation of these mutations in designing Pvs48/45-based TBV.
