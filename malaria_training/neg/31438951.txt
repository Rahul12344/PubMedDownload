BACKGROUND: The ability of Plasmodium falciparum parasites to develop resistance 
to widely used anti-malarials threatens malaria control and elimination efforts. 
Regular drug efficacy monitoring is essential for ensuring effective treatment
policies. In low transmission settings where therapeutic efficacy studies are
often not feasible, routine surveillance for molecular markers associated with
anti-malarial resistance provides an alternative for the early detection of
emerging resistance. Such a longitudinal survey of changes in the prevalence of
selected molecular markers of resistance was conducted in the malaria-endemic
regions of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, where malaria elimination at a
district-level is being pursued.
METHODS: Molecular analyses to determine the prevalence of alleles associated
with resistance to lumefantrine (mdr86N, crt76K and mdr1 copy number variation)
and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (dhfr triple, dhps double, SP quintuple) were
conducted between 2001 and 2018, while artemisinin resistance markers (kelch13
mutations) were assessed only in 2018.
RESULTS: Parasite DNA was successfully amplified from 1667/2393 (70%) of
malaria-positive rapid diagnostic tests routinely collected at primary health
care facilities. No artemisinin resistance-associated kelch13 mutations nor
amplification of the mdr1 gene copy number associated with lumefantrine
resistance were observed. However, prevalence of both the mdr86N and crt76K
alleles increased markedly over the study period, with all isolates collected in 
2018 carrying these markers. SP quintuple mutation prevalence increased steadily 
from 14% in 2001 to 96% in 2018. Mixed alleles at any of the codons assessed were
rare by 2018.
CONCLUSION: No kelch13 mutations confirmed or suspected to be associated with
artemisinin resistance were identified in 2018. Although parasites carrying the
mdr86N and crt76K alleles associated with reduced lumefantrine susceptibility
were strongly selected for over the study period, nearing fixation by 2018, the
marker for lumefantrine resistance, namely increased mdr1 copy number, was not
observed in this study. The increase in mdr86N and crt76K allele prevalence
together with intense regional artemether-lumefantrine drug pressure, raises
concern regarding the sustained artemether-lumefantrine efficacy. Regular,
rigorous anti-malarial resistance marker surveillance across all three South
African malaria-endemic provinces to inform case management is recommended.
