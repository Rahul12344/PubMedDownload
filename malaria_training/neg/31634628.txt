IL-27, a regulatory cytokine, plays critical roles in the prevention of
immunopathology during Plasmodium infection. We examined these roles in the
immune responses against Plasmodium chabaudi infection using the Il-27ra-/- mice.
While IL-27 was expressed at high levels during the early phase of the infection,
enhanced CD4+ T cell function and reduction in parasitemia were observed mainly
during the chronic phase in the mutant mice. In mice infected with P. chabaudi
and cured with drug, CD4+ T cells in the Il-27ra-/- mice exhibited enhanced CD4+ 
T-cell responses, indicating the inhibitory role of IL-27 on the protective
immune responses. To determine the role of IL-27 in detail, we performed CD4+
T-cell transfer experiments. The Il-27ra-/- and Il27p28-/- mice were first
infected with P. chabaudi and then cured using drug treatment. Plasmodium-antigen
primed CD4+ T cells were prepared from these mice and transferred into the
recipient mice, followed by infection with the heterologous parasite P. berghei
ANKA. Il-27ra-/- CD4+ T cells in the infected recipient mice did not produce
IL-10, indicating that IL-10 production by primed CD4+ T cells is IL-27
dependent. Il27p28-/- CD4+ T cells that were primed in the absence of IL-27
exhibited enhanced recall responses during the challenge infection with P.
berghei ANKA, implying that IL-27 receptor signaling during the primary infection
affects recall responses in the long-term via the regulation of the memory CD4+ T
cell generation. These features highlighted direct and time-transcending roles of
IL-27 in the regulation of immune responses against chronic infection with
Plasmodium parasites.
