BACKGROUND: The Republic of Yemen has the highest incidence of malaria in the
Arabian Peninsula, yet little is known of its vectors or transmission dynamics.
METHODS: A 24-month study of the vectors and related epidemiological aspects of
malaria transmission was conducted in two villages in the Taiz region in
2004-2005.
RESULTS: Cross-sectional blood film surveys recorded an overall malaria infection
rate of 15.3 % (250/1638), with highest rates exceeding 30 % in one village in
May and December 2005. With one exception, Plasmodium malariae, all infections
were P. falciparum. Seven Anopheles species were identified among 3407
anophelines collected indoors using light traps (LT) and pyrethrum knockdown
catches (PKD): Anopheles arabiensis (86.9 %), An. sergentii (9 %), An. azaniae,
An. dthali, An. pretoriensis, An. coustani and An. algeriensis. Sequences for the
standard barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene confirmed the presence of
two morphological forms of An. azaniae, the typical form and a previously
unrecognized form not immediately identifiable as An. azaniae. ELISA detected
Plasmodium sporozoites in 0.9 % of 2921 An. arabiensis (23 P. falciparum, two P. 
vivax) confirming this species as the primary malaria vector in Yemen. Plasmodium
falciparum sporozoites were detected in An. sergentii (2/295) and a single female
of An. algeriensis, incriminating both species as malaria vectors for the first
time in Yemen. A vector in both wet and dry seasons, An. arabiensis was
predominantly anthropophilic (human blood index = 0.86) with an entomological
inoculation rate of 1.58 infective bites/person/year. Anopheles sergentii fed on 
cattle (67.3 %) and humans (48.3; 20.7 % mixed both species), but only 14.7 %
were found in PKDs, indicating predominantly exophilic behaviour. A GIS analysis 
of geographic and socio-economic parameters revealed that An. arabiensis were
significantly higher (P < 0.001) in houses with televisions, most likely due to
the popular evening habit of viewing television collectively in houses with open 
doors and windows.
CONCLUSIONS: The predominantly indoor human biting vectors recorded in this study
could be targeted effectively with LLINs, indoor residual spraying and/or
insecticide-treated window/door curtains reinforced by education to instil a
perception that effective and affordable malaria prevention is achievable.
