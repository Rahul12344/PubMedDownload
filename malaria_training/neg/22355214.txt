The onset, severity, and ultimate outcome of malaria infection are influenced by 
parasite-expressed virulence factors as well as by individual host responses to
these determinants. In both humans and mice, liver injury follows parasite entry,
persisting to the erythrocytic stage in the case of infection with the fatal
strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-1α is a master
regulator of not only the liver damage and adaptive responses but also diverse
metabolic functions. In this study, we analyzed the expression of host HNF-1α in 
relation to malaria infection and evaluated its interaction with the
5'-untranslated region of subtilisin-like protease 2 (subtilase, Sub2).
Recombinant human HNF-1α expressed by a lentiviral vector (LV HNF-1α) was
introduced into mice. Interestingly, differences in the activity of the
5'-untranslated region of the Pf-Sub2 promoter were detected in 293T cells, and
LV HNF-1α was observed to influence promoter activity, suggesting that host
HNF-1α interacts with the Sub2 gene.
