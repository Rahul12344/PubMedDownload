Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium parasites through the bite of female
Anopheles mosquitoes. One of the most important mosquito vectors in the Greater
Mekong Subregion is Anopheles dirus. This study reports RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) 
transcriptome analysis of An. dirus at 18 hours and 7 days after a P.
vivax-infected blood meal, which represent infection at the ookinete and oocyst
parasite developmental stages, respectively. Following infection, 582 An. dirus
transcripts were modulated. The 2,408 P. vivax transcripts could be classified
into ookinete-specific, two-stage, and oocyst-specific groups. Results were
validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Gene
ontology analysis of the vector and parasite revealed several biological pathways
for both, providing a better understanding of Anopheles-Plasmodium interactions
at the ookinete and oocyst stages.
