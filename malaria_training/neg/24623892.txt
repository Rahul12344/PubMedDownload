Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major public health problem in Thailand due to
the emergence of multidrug resistance. The understanding of genetic diversity of 
malaria parasites is essential for developing effective drugs and vaccines. The
genetic diversity of the merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1) and merozoite
surface protein-2 (PfMSP-2) genes was investigated in a total of 145 P.
falciparum isolates collected from Mae Sot District, Tak Province, Thailand
during 3 different periods (1997-1999, 2005-2007, and 2009-2010). Analysis of
genetic polymorphisms was performed to track the evolution of genetic change of
P. falciparum using PCR. Both individual genes and their combination patterns
showed marked genetic diversity during the 3 study periods. The results strongly 
support that P. falciparum isolates in Thailand are markedly diverse and patterns
changed with time. These 2 polymorphic genes could be used as molecular markers
to detect multiple clone infections and differentiate recrudescence from
reinfection in P. falciparum isolates in Thailand.
