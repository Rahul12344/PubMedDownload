Malaria remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite decades of 
public health efforts. The recent commitment by many endemic countries to
eliminate malaria marks a shift away from programs aimed at controlling disease
burden towards one that emphasizes reducing transmission of the most virulent
human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Gametocytes, the only
developmental stage of malaria parasites able to infect mosquitoes, have remained
understudied, as they occur in low numbers, do not cause disease, and are
difficult to detect in vivo by conventional methods. Here, we review the
transmission biology of P. falciparum gametocytes, featuring important recent
discoveries of genes affecting parasite commitment to gametocyte formation,
microvesicles enabling parasites to communicate with each other, and the
anatomical site where immature gametocytes develop. We propose potential parasite
targets for future intervention and highlight remaining knowledge gaps.
