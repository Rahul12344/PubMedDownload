A new protein, termed apicortin, has recently been identified, which occurs only 
in the placozoan animal Trichoplax adhaerens and in the genomes of all currently 
sequenced apicomplexan parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma, Plasmodium, etc.). Apicortins
unite two conserved domains, a DCX motif and a partial p25alpha sequence, which
are singly found in diverse other proteins, in doublecortins and TPPPs,
respectively. Here I show that although apicortin has a limited phylogenomic
distribution, its occurrence is broader than thought previously. It has been
identified in another primitive opisthokont, in the chytrid fungus, Spizellomyces
punctatus. Apicortins can be divided into two subgroups: apicomplexan and
non-apicomplexan ones. The main difference is that the former ones possess a
long, N-terminal extension predicted to be disordered, which is missing in the
other subgroup. The appearance of the extension in apicomplexan apicortins is an 
"innovation" of this phylum, and may play a functional role in the
protein-protein interactions.
