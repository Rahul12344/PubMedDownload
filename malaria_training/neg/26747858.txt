Culicidae) Populations.

Knockdown resistance (kdr) in insects resulting from mutation(s) in the
voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene is one of the mechanisms of resistance
against DDT and the pyrethroid group of insecticides. Earlier, we reported the
presence of two classic kdr mutations, i.e., L1014F and L1014S in Anopheles
stephensi Liston, a major Indian malaria vector affecting mainly urban areas.
This report presents the distribution of these alleles in different An. stephensi
populations. Seven populations of An. stephensi from six states of India were
screened for the presence of two alternative kdr mutations L1014F and L1014S
using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We recorded the presence 
of both kdr mutations in northern Indian populations (Alwar and Gurgaon), with
the preponderance of L1014S, whereas only L1014F was present in Raipur (central
India) and Chennai (southern India). None of the kdr mutations were found in
Ranchi in eastern India and in Mangaluru and Mysuru in southern India. This study
provides evidence for a focal pattern of distribution of kdr alleles in India.
