There is increasing evidence that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, is
endemic in west and central Africa, a region from which it was previously thought
to be almost completely absent due to the very high prevalence of the Duffy
negative phenotype in the local human populations. Furthermore, P. vivax, or very
closely related parasites, has been identified in both chimpanzees and gorillas
from this region. In this review, we discuss the implications of these findings
for the current understanding of the origins of P. vivax as a human parasite.
With the support of new evidence from mitochondrial genome sequencing, we propose
that the evidence is consistent with current, extant P. vivax populations having 
their origins in Africa.
