BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to anti-malarial drugs remains a
major obstacle to malaria control and elimination. The parasite has developed
resistance to every anti-malarial drug introduced for wide-scale treatment.
However, the spread of resistance may be reversible. Malawi was the first country
to discontinue chloroquine use due to widespread resistance. Within a decade of
the removal of drug pressure, the molecular marker of chloroquine-resistant
malaria had disappeared and the drug was shown to have excellent clinical
efficacy. Many countries have observed decreases in the prevalence of chloroquine
resistance with the discontinuation of chloroquine use. In Zambia, chloroquine
was used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria until treatment
failures led the Ministry of Health to replace it with artemether-lumefantrine in
2003. Specimens from a recent study were analysed to evaluate prevalence of
chloroquine-resistant malaria in Nchelenge district a decade after chloroquine
use was discontinued.
METHODS: Parasite DNA was extracted from dried blood spots collected by
finger-prick in pregnant women who were enrolling in a clinical trial. The
specimens underwent pyrosequencing to determine the genotype of the P. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter, the gene that is associated with CQ
resistance.
RESULTS: Three-hundred and two specimens were successfully analysed. No
chloroquine-resistant genotypes were detected.
CONCLUSION: The study found the disappearance of chloroquine-resistant malaria
after the removal of chloroquine drug pressure. Chloroquine may have a role for
malaria prevention or treatment in Zambia and throughout the region in the
future.
