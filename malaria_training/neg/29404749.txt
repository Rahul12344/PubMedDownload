Current knowledge about liver responses to blood-stage malaria and their
modulation by vaccination is still unclear. This study investigated effects of
protective vaccination on liver gene and lincRNA expression of Balb/c mice at
early prepatency of Plasmodium chabaudi blood-stage malaria. When a blood-stage
vaccine was used to induce > 80% survival of otherwise lethal malaria,
significant differences (p < 0.01) were detectable in global liver gene
expression between vaccination-protected (potentially surviving) and
non-protected non-vaccinated mice on day 1 p.i.. In the livers of protected mice,
gene expression microarrays identified 224 and 419 genes, whose expression was
up- and downregulated by > 3-fold, respectively. There were 24 genes upregulated 
by > 10-fold, including 10 IFN-inducible genes encompassing GTPases Irgm1, 2, and
3, and guanylate-binding protein Gbp11, the IL-1 decoy receptors Il1f9 and
Il1ra1, the Il6 gene, and the gene for facilitated glucose transportation.
Moreover, the IL-18 decoy receptor gene Il18bp, Gzmb, the genes Lif and Osmr
encoding proteins of the IL-6 family, and the taurine transporter gene Slc6a6
were expressed > 3-fold in vaccinated mice. The genes Gbp10, 6, 4 were expressed 
by > 50% in vaccination-protected than in non-vaccinated mice. In addition, 43
lincRNA species were up- and 36 downregulated. Our data suggested novel
regulatory elements of potential anti-malaria activity activated by protective
vaccination in the liver, evidenced in response to early prepatent infections in 
vaccination-protected mice of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria of P.
chabaudi.
