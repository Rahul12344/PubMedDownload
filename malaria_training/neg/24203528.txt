During the search for novel natural products from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus
doucetiae DSM17909 and X. mauleonii DSM17908 novel peptides named xenoamicins
were identified in addition to the already known antibiotics xenocoumacin and
xenorhabdin. Xenoamicins are acylated tridecadepsipeptides consisting of mainly
hydrophobic amino acids. The main derivative xenoamicin A (1) was isolated from
X. mauleonii DSM17908, and its structure elucidated by detailed 1D and 2D NMR
experiments. Detailed MS experiments, also in combination with labeling
experiments, confirmed the determined structure and allowed structure elucidation
of additional derivatives. Moreover, the xenoamicin biosynthesis gene cluster was
identified and analyzed in X. doucetiae DSM17909, and its participation in
xenoamicin biosynthesis was confirmed by mutagenesis. Advanced Marfey's analysis 
of 1 showed that the absolute configuration of the amino acids is in agreement
with the predicted stereochemistry deduced from the nonribosomal peptide
synthetase XabABCD. Biological testing revealed activity of 1 against Plasmodium 
falciparum and other neglected tropical diseases but no antibacterial activity.
