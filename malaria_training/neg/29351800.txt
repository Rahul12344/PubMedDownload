BACKGROUND: Malaria is highly prevalent in many parts of India and is mostly
caused by the parasite species Plasmodium vivax followed by Plasmodium
falciparum. Chloroquine (CQ) is the first-line treatment for blood stage P. vivax
parasites, but cases of drug resistance to CQ have been reported from India. One 
of the surveillance strategies which is used to monitor CQ drug resistance, is
the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the associated gene
markers. Susceptibility to CQ can also be determined by copy number assessment of
multidrug resistant gene (mdr-1). The current study has examined the prevalence
of SNPs in P. vivax orthologs of P. falciparum chloroquine resistant and
multi-drug resistant genes (pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1, respectively) and pvmdr-1 copy
number variations in isolates from the highly endemic Mangaluru city near the
South Western Coastal region of India.
METHODS: A total of 140 blood samples were collected from P. vivax infected
patients attending Wenlock Hospital Mangaluru during July 2014 to January 2016.
Out of these 140 samples, sequencing was carried out for 54 (38.5%) and 85
(60.7%) isolates for pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1, respectively. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pvcrt-o and pvmdr-1 genes were analysed by direct
sequencing method, while copy number variations of 60 isolates (42. 8%) were
determined by real time PCR.
RESULTS: Out of 54 clinical isolates analysed for pvcrt-o, three (5.6%) showed
K10 insertion and the rest had wild type sequence. This is the first report to
show K10 insertion in P. vivax isolates from India. Further, out of 85 clinical
isolates of P. vivax analysed for mutations in pvmdr-1 gene, only one isolate had
wild type sequence (~Â 1%) while the remaining (99%) carried mutant alleles. Seven
non-synonymous mutations with two novel mutations (I946V and Y1028C) were
observed. Of all the observed mutations in pvmdr-1 gene, T958M was most highly
prevalent (present in 90% of samples) followed by F1076L (76%), and Y976F (7%).
Amplification of pvmdr-1 gene was observed in 31.6% of the isolates, out of 60
amplified.
CONCLUSION: The observed variations both in pvmdr-1 and pvcrt-o genes indicate a 
trend towards parasite acquiring CQ resistance in this endemic area.
