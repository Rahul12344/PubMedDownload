BACKGROUND: Role of epigenetic mechanisms towards regulation of the complex life 
cycle/pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, has 
been poorly understood. To elucidate stage-specific epigenetic regulation, we
performed genome-wide mapping of multiple histone modifications of P. falciparum.
Further to understand the differences in transcription regulation in P.
falciparum and its host, human, we compared their histone modification profiles.
RESULTS: Our comprehensive comparative analysis suggests distinct mode of
transcriptional regulation in malaria parasite by virtue of poised genes and
differential histone modifications. Furthermore, analysis of histone modification
profiles predicted 562 genes producing anti-sense RNAs and 335 genes having
bidirectional promoter activity, which raises the intriguing possibility of
RNA-mediated regulation of transcription in P. falciparum. Interestingly, we
found that H3K36me2 acts as a global repressive mark and gene regulation is fine 
tuned by the ratio of activation marks to H3K36me2 in P. falciparum. This novel
mechanism of gene regulation is supported by the fact that knockout of SET genes 
(responsible for H3K36 methylation) leads to up-regulation of genes with highest 
occupancy of H3K36me2 in wild-type P. falciparum. Moreover, virulence (var) genes
are mostly poised and marked by a unique set of activation (H4ac) and repression 
(H3K9me3) marks, which are mutually exclusive to other Plasmodium housekeeping
genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals unique plasticity in the epigenetic regulation in 
P. falciparum which can influence parasite virulence and pathogenicity. The
observed differences in the histone code and transcriptional regulation in P.
falciparum and its host will open new avenues for epigenetic drug development
against malaria parasite.
