Genomic maps of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) can help elucidate the roles that these 
secondary structures play in various organisms. Herein, we employ an improved
version of a G-quadruplex sequencing method (G4-seq) to generate whole genome G4 
maps for 12 species that include widely studied model organisms and also
pathogens of clinical relevance. We identify G4 structures that form under
physiological K+ conditions and also G4s that are stabilized by the G4-targeting 
small molecule pyridostatin (PDS). We discuss the various structural features of 
the experimentally observed G-quadruplexes (OQs), highlighting differences in
their prevalence and enrichment across species. Our study describes diversity in 
sequence composition and genomic location for the OQs in the different species
and reveals that the enrichment of OQs in gene promoters is particular to mammals
such as mouse and human, among the species studied. The multi-species maps have
been made publicly available as a resource to the research community. The maps
can serve as blueprints for biological experiments in those model organisms,
where G4 structures may play a role.
