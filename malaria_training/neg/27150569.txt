MOTIVATION: Biological processes involve much complex interplay between cellular 
molecules at different molecular levels, and this interplay may exhibit various
co-expression patterns explicitly representing the cellular inner regulation
mechanism. Whereas, coexpression patterns cannot be necessarily conserved across 
the different molecular levels for complex regulation processes involved even
after transcripts being produced. Investigation of co-expression propagation from
transcript level to protein level will reflect inner regulation effects in
function states of cells.
RESULTS: In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of gene coexpression
patterns in Plasmodium falciparum. We investigate coexpression patterns
propagation from transcript level to protein level to reveal the underlying
biological meaning of post-transcriptional and translational mechanism. Our
systems-level approach shows after posttranscriptional and translational
regulation gene co-expression pace at protein level is mechanistically adjusted
to higher synchronicity. Moreover, co-expression patterns at protein level are
more linked to function categories, such as co-expression at the same time point 
is more related with binding categories, and co-expression delayed by several
time points is more related with activity categories. Therefore,
posttranscriptional and translational regulation modulates co-expression
relationships between molecules for meeting the function demands.
