The alignment of the evolutionary history of parasites with that of plants
provides a different panorama in the drug development process. The housing of
different metabolic processes, essential for parasite survival, adds to the
indispensability of the apicoplast. The different pathways responsible for
fueling the apicoplast and parasite offer a myriad of proteins responsible for
the apicoplast function. The studies emphasizing the target-based approaches
might help in the discovery of antimalarials. The different putative drug targets
and their roles are highlighted. In addition, the origin of the apicoplast and
metabolic processes are reviewed and the different drugs acting upon the enzymes 
of the apicoplast are discussed.
