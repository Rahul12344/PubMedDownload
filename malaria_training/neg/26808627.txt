BACKGROUND: The use of antimalarial drugs for prevention and treatment is a major
strategy in the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. Although
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently recommended for intermittent
preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy in Nigeria, previously used
drugs for prophylaxis such as chloroquine (CQ) and pyrimethamine are accessible
as they are purchased over the counter. This study describes the markers of
absence or presence of resistance to quinoline (Pfcrt and Pfmdr 1) and type 1
antifolate antimalarial medicines (Pfdhfr).
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum-positive dried blood spots from pregnant women
attending antenatal clinics for the first time during current pregnancy were
investigated for the presence of mutations at codons 72-76 of Plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene by real time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using haplotype-specific probes. PCR followed by 
sequence analysis was used to identify mutations at codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042
and 1246 of P. falciparum multi-drug resistance-1 (Pfmdr1) gene; and codons 16,
50, 51, 59, 108, 140 and 164 of Pfdhfr gene.
RESULTS: Two haplotypes of Pfcrt (n = 54) were observed: CVMNK 13(24.2%) and
CVIET 41 (75.9%) of the samples. The SVMNT haplotype was absent in this
population. The Pfmdr1 (n = 28) haplotypes were NYSND 15(53.6%), YYSND 5(17.9%), 
NFSND 6(21.4%) and YFSND 2(7.1%). The Pfdhfr (n = 15) were ACNCSVI 4(26.7%), and 
ACICNSVI 1(6.7%) and ACIRNVI 10 (66.7%). The rate of occurrence of Pfcrt 76T,
Pfdhfr108N, Pfmdr186Y and 184F were 75.9%, 73.3%, 25% and 28.1% respectively. The
Pfmdr1 86Y was associated with low parasitaemia (median = 71 parasites/μl, P =
0.024) while Pfcrt 76T was associated with young maternal age (mean 24.1 ± 4.5
years; P = 0.006). The median parasitaemia were similar (P>0.05) in wild and
mutant strains of Pfcrt 76, Pfmdr1 184 and Pfdhfr 108. There was no association
between gravidity or gestational age of the women and presence of mutations in
the Pfcrt, Pfmdr1 or Pfdhfr genes (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Markers of resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine were high,
whereas cycloguanil-resistance marker was not present in the studied population. 
The low level of mutations in the Pfmdr1gene indicates likely efficacy of
amodiaquine against malaria in pregnancy.
