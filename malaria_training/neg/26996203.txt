Plasmodium multigene families play a central role in the pathogenesis of malaria.
The Plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes comprise the largest multigene
family in many Plasmodium spp. However their function(s) remains unknown. Using
the rodent model of malaria, Plasmodium chabaudi, we show that individual CIR
proteins have differential localizations within infected red cell (iRBC),
suggesting different functional roles in a blood-stage infection. Some CIRs
appear to be located on the surface of iRBC and merozoites and are therefore well
placed to interact with host molecules. In line with this hypothesis, we show for
the first time that a subset of recombinant CIRs bind mouse RBCs suggesting a
role for CIR in rosette formation and/or invasion. Together, our results unravel 
differences in subcellular localization and ability to bind mouse erythrocytes
between the members of the cir family, which strongly suggest different
functional roles in a blood-stage infection.
