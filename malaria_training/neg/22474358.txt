Unique peptide-morpholino oligomer (PMO) conjugates have been designed to bind
and promote the cleavage of specific mRNA as a tool to inhibit gene function and 
parasite growth. The new conjugates were validated using the P. falciparum gyrase
mRNA as a target (PfGyrA). Assays in vitro demonstrated a selective degradation
of the PfGyrA mRNA directed by the external guide sequences, which are morpholino
oligomers in the conjugates. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that labeled
conjugates are delivered into Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes during all
intraerythrocytic stages of parasite development. Consistent with the expression 
of PfGyrA in all stages of parasite development, proliferation assays showed that
these conjugates have potent antimalarial activity, blocking early development,
maturation, and replication of the parasite. The conjugates were equally
effective against drug sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains. The
potency, selectivity, and predicted safety of PMO conjugates make this approach
attractive for the development of a unique class of target-specific antimalarials
and for large-scale functional analysis of the malarial genome.
