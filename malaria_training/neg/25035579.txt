Present study reports the prevalence and distribution of pfcrt K76T and mdr1 N86Y
mutations in malaria endemic areas of Sonitpur district of Assam. Out of 163
individuals tested for malaria, 67 (SPR = 41.1 %) were detected positive for
malaria infection using rapid detection kit in the field and PCR assay in the
laboratory. Nested PCR-RFLP assay was used to amplify pfcrt K76T and mdr1 N86Y
genes flanking the K76T and N86Y mutations. P. falciparum was most abundant
(91.04 %) among the three Plasmodium species reported and its prevalence was
significantly higher as compared to P. vivax and P. malariae (χ(2) = 150.76;
p ≤ 0.0001; df = 2). Malaria was equally distributed among all the age groups and
both the sexes. Hemoglobin contents in severe anaemic patients had a significant 
linear decreasing trend among patients with the increase in age (χ(2) = 4.33;
p = 0.03), whereas non severe anaemic patients exhibited significant linear
increasing trend among the patients with the increase in age (χ(2) = 18.38;
p ≤ 0.0001). Pfcrt K76T mutation was recorded in 44 (72.13 %) isolates, whereas
mdr1 N86Y mutation could be detected in 28 (41.79 %) isolates only. Only 32.7 %
of the samples had both pfcrt K76T and mdr N86Y mutations. Number of pfcrt K76T
mutant isolates was significantly higher than the wild type. However no
significant difference was observed among the number of isolates with mdr1 N86Y
mutant and wild isolates.
