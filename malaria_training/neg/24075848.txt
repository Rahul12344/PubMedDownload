Cytokine gene variants are known to influence both infectious disease
susceptibility and harm-avoidant behaviors, suggesting that these risk variants
may be pleiotropically linked to instinctual disease-avoidant traits. The
gamma-interferon (IFNG) +874 T>A polymorphism (rs2430561) is an ideal candidate
gene variant for immune-behavioral studies. It is a functional SNP, regulating
IFNG mRNA expression; it is known to modulate serotonergic activity and is
therefore capable of modifying behavior; and it has previously been associated
with increased susceptibility to malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and Chagas
disease. We hypothesized that the infectious disease-high-risk IFNG +874 A-allele
would be associated with four personality traits previously reported as
behavioral defenses against infection: Harm Avoidance (HA), Extraversion (E),
Exploratory Excitability (Exp E), and Openness to Experience (O). We tested this 
hypothesis in a sample of 168 healthy university students from Southern
California genotyped for IFNG +874 T>A and evaluated by the Temperament and
Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). 
We found that the infectious disease-high-risk IFNG +874 A-allele was associated 
with increased HA (P=0.001) and decreased E (P=0.030) and Exp E (P=0.030). These 
findings suggest that the IFNG +874 A gene variant is linked both to infectious
disease susceptibility and to proactive behavioral defenses that reduce infection
risk in healthy subjects.
