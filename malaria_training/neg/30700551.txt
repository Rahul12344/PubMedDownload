Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) 4-nitrophenylphosphatase has been shown previously to 
be involved in vitamin B1 metabolism. Here, conducting a BLASTp search, we found 
that 4-nitrophenylphosphatase from Pf has significant homology with
phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) from mouse, human, and yeast, prompting us to 
reinvestigate the biochemical properties of the Plasmodium enzyme. Because the
recombinant PfPGP enzyme is insoluble, we performed an extended substrate screen 
and extensive biochemical characterization of the recombinantly expressed and
purified homolog from Plasmodium berghei (Pb), leading to the identification of
2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phospho-L-lactate as the relevant physiological
substrates of PbPGP. 2-Phosphoglycolate is generated during repair of damaged DNA
ends, 2-phospho-L-lactate is a product of pyruvate kinase side reaction, and both
potently inhibit two key glycolytic enzymes, triosephosphate isomerase and
phosphofructokinase. Hence, PGP-mediated clearance of these toxic metabolites is 
vital for cell survival and functioning. Our results differ significantly from
those in a previous study, wherein the PfPGP enzyme has been inferred to act on
2-phospho-D-lactate and not on the L isomer. Apart from resolving the substrate
specificity conflict through direct in vitro enzyme assays, we conducted PGP gene
knockout studies in P. berghei, confirming that this conserved metabolic
proofreading enzyme is essential in Plasmodium In summary, our findings establish
PbPGP as an essential enzyme for normal physiological function in P. berghei and 
suggest that drugs that specifically inhibit Plasmodium PGP may hold promise for 
use in anti-malarial therapies.
