BACKGROUND: Genomes rearrangements carry valuable information for phylogenetic
inference or the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of adaptation. However, the 
detection of genome rearrangements is often hampered by current deficiencies in
data and methods: Genomes obtained from short sequence reads have generally very 
fragmented assemblies, and comparing multiple gene orders generally leads to
computationally intractable algorithmic questions.
RESULTS: We present a computational method, ADSEQ, which, by combining ancestral 
gene order reconstruction, comparative scaffolding and de novo scaffolding
methods, overcomes these two caveats. ADSEQ provides simultaneously improved
assemblies and ancestral genomes, with statistical supports on all local
features. Compared to previous comparative methods, it runs in polynomial time,
it samples solutions in a probabilistic space, and it can handle a significantly 
larger gene complement from the considered extant genomes, with complex histories
including gene duplications and losses. We use ADSEQ to provide improved
assemblies and a genome history made of duplications, losses, gene
translocations, rearrangements, of 18 complete Anopheles genomes, including
several important malaria vectors. We also provide additional support for a
differentiated mode of evolution of the sex chromosome and of the autosomes in
these mosquito genomes.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the method's ability to improve extant assemblies
accurately through a procedure simulating realistic assembly fragmentation. We
study a debated issue regarding the phylogeny of the Gambiae complex group of
Anopheles genomes in the light of the evolution of chromosomal rearrangements,
suggesting that the phylogenetic signal they carry can differ from the
phylogenetic signal carried by gene sequences, more prone to introgression.
