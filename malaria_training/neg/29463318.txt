Although the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering approaches was first
reported in apicomplexan parasites only 3 years ago, this technology has rapidly 
become an essential component of research on apicomplexan parasites. This review 
briefly describes the history of CRISPR/Cas9 and the principles behind its use
along with documenting its implementation in apicomplexan parasites, especially
Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. We also discuss the recent use of
CRISPR/Cas9 for whole genome screening of gene knockout mutants in T. gondii and 
highlight its use for seminal genetic manipulations of Cryptosporidium spp.
Finally, we consider new variations of CRISPR/Cas9 that have yet to be
implemented in apicomplexans. Whereas CRISPR/Cas9 has already accelerated rapid
interrogation of gene function in apicomplexans, the full potential of this
technology is yet to be realized as new variations and innovations are integrated
into the field.
