Microscopic examination of thin blood smear of a domestic pigeon brought to
Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Junagadh, Gujarat revealed mature and
immature halter shaped gametocytes of Haemoproteus columbae encircling the
nucleated erythrocytes. The disease was diagnosed as acute infection of pigeon
malaria more notably known as pseudomalaria. The parasitic infection was further 
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the Cytochrome b (cyt b)
gene fragment amplifying 207 base pair (bp) fragment. Pseudolynchia canariensis, 
the vector for H. columbae was also recovered from underneath the feathers of the
affected pigeon.
