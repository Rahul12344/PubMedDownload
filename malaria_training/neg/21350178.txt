Metarhizium anisopliae infects mosquitoes through the cuticle and proliferates in
the hemolymph. To allow M. anisopliae to combat malaria in mosquitoes with
advanced malaria infections, we produced recombinant strains expressing molecules
that target sporozoites as they travel through the hemolymph to the salivary
glands. Eleven days after a Plasmodium-infected blood meal, mosquitoes were
treated with M. anisopliae expressing salivary gland and midgut peptide 1 (SM1), 
which blocks attachment of sporozoites to salivary glands; a single-chain
antibody that agglutinates sporozoites; or scorpine, which is an antimicrobial
toxin. These reduced sporozoite counts by 71%, 85%, and 90%, respectively. M.
anisopliae expressing scorpine and an [SM1](8):scorpine fusion protein reduced
sporozoite counts by 98%, suggesting that Metarhizium-mediated inhibition of
Plasmodium development could be a powerful weapon for combating malaria.
