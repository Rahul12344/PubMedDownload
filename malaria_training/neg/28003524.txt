Individual genetic diversity is predicted to influence host-parasite
interactions. Together with the genes directly associated with immune responses, 
variation in genes regulating vertebrate melanin-based pigmentation may play an
important role in these interactions, mainly through the pleiotropic effects that
affect colour-specific physiology, behaviour and immunity. Here, we test the
hypothesis that the prevalence of avian malarial parasites differs between
phenotypes in a raptor species in which the genetic basis of colour polymorphism 
and its pleiotropic effects over immune functions are known. We found that dark
morphs had a higher prevalence of Plasmodium parasites than pale ones but
detected no such association for Haemoproteus This pattern may be associated with
unequal exposure to vectors or, as suggested by our circumstantial evidence, to a
differential ability to mount an immune response against blood parasites.
