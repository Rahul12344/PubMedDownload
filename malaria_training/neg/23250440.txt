One-fourth of Plasmodium falciparum proteins have asparagine repeats that
increase the propensity for aggregation, especially at elevated temperatures that
occur routinely in malaria-infected patients. Here we report that a Plasmodium
Asn repeat-containing protein (PFI1155w) formed aggregates in mammalian cells at 
febrile temperatures, as did a yeast Asn/Gln-rich protein (Sup35). Co-expression 
of the cytoplasmic P. falciparum heat shock protein 110 (PfHsp110c) prevented
aggregation. Human or yeast orthologs were much less effective. All-Asn and
all-Gln versions of Sup35 were protected from aggregation by PfHsp110c,
suggesting that this chaperone is not limited to handling runs of asparagine.
PfHsp110c gene-knockout parasites were not viable and conditional knockdown
parasites died slowly in the absence of protein-stabilizing ligand. When exposed 
to brief heat shock, these knockdowns were unable to prevent aggregation of
PFI1155w or Sup35 and died rapidly. We conclude that PfHsp110c protects the
parasite from harmful effects of its asparagine repeat-rich proteome during
febrile episodes.
