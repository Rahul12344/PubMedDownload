BACKGROUND: Infection by the human malaria parasite leads to important changes in
mosquito phenotypic traits related to vector competence. However, we still lack a
clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and, in particular, of the
epigenetic basis for these changes. We have examined genome-wide distribution
maps of H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 by ChIP-seq and the transcriptome by
RNA-seq, of midguts from Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes blood-fed uninfected and
infected with natural isolates of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum in Burkina Faso.
RESULTS: We report 15,916 regions containing differential histone modification
enrichment between infected and uninfected, of which 8339 locate at promoters
and/or intersect with genes. The functional annotation of these regions allowed
us to identify infection-responsive genes showing differential enrichment in
various histone modifications, such as CLIP proteases, antimicrobial
peptides-encoding genes, and genes related to melanization responses and the
complement system. Further, the motif analysis of regions differentially enriched
in various histone modifications predicts binding sites that might be involved in
the cis-regulation of these regions, such as Deaf1, Pangolin and Dorsal
transcription factors (TFs). Some of these TFs are known to regulate immunity
gene expression in Drosophila and are involved in the Notch and JAK/STAT
signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of malaria infection-induced chromatin changes in
mosquitoes is important not only to identify regulatory elements and genes
underlying mosquito responses to P. falciparum infection, but also for possible
applications to the genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and to other
mosquito-borne systems.
