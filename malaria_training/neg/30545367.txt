BACKGROUND: For the success of the malaria control and eradication programme it
is essential to reduce parasite transmission by mosquito vectors. In the midguts 
of mosquitoes fed with parasite-infected blood, sexual-stage parasites fertilize 
to develop into motile ookinetes that traverse midgut epithelial cells and reside
adjacent the basal lamina. Therefore, the ookinete is a promising target of
transmission-blocking vaccines to break the parasite lifecycle in mosquito
vectors. However, the molecular mechanisms of ookinete formation and invasion of 
epithelial cells have not been fully elucidated. A unique structure called the
crystalloid body has been identified in the ookinete cytoplasm by electron
microscopy, but its biological functions remain unclear.
METHODS: A recombinant protein of a novel molecule, designated as crystalloid
body specific PH domain-containing protein of Plasmodium yoelii (PyCryPH), was
synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system. Specific rabbit antibodies
against PyCryPH were obtained to characterize the expression and localization of 
PyCryPH during sexual-stage parasite development. In addition, PyCryPH knockout
parasites were generated by targeted gene disruption to examine PyCryPH function 
in mosquito-stage parasite development.
RESULTS: Western blot and immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies
showed that PyCryPH is specifically expressed in zygotes and ookinetes. By
immunoelectron microscopy it was demonstrated that PyCryPH is localized within
crystalloid bodies. Parasites with a disrupted PyCryPH gene developed normally
into ookinetes and formed oocysts on the basal lamina of midguts. In addition,
the number of sporozoites residing in salivary glands was comparable to that of
wild-type parasites.
CONCLUSIONS: CryPH, containing a signal peptide and PH domain, is predominantly
expressed in zygotes and ookinetes and is localized to crystalloid bodies in P.
yoelii. CryPH accumulates in vesicle-like structures prior to the appearance of
typical crystalloid bodies. Unlike other known crystalloid body localized
proteins, CryPH does not appear to have a multiple domain architecture
characteristic of the LAP/CCp family proteins. Although CryPH is highly conserved
among Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Cryptosporidium, PyCryPH is dispensable
for the development of invasive ookinetes and sporozoites in mosquito bodies.
