BACKGROUND: Poor knowledge on the afebrile Plasmodium falciparum biology limits
elimination approaches to target asymptomatic malaria. Therefore, the association
of parasite factors involved in cytoadhesion, parasite multiplication and
gametocyte maturation with afebrile malaria was assessed.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected from febrile (axillary
temperature ≥ 37.5 °C or a reported fever in the previous 24 h) and afebrile
(fever neither at the visit nor in the previous 24 h) individuals residing in
Southern Mozambique. var, PfSir2a and Pfs25 transcript levels were determined by 
reverse transcriptase quantitative PCRs (RT-qPCRs) and compared among 61 pairs of
isolates matched by parasite density, age and year of sample collection.
RESULTS: The level of varC and PfSir2a transcripts was higher in P. falciparum
isolates from afebrile individuals (P ≤ 0.006), while varB and DC8 genes
(P ≤ 0.002) were higher in isolates from individuals with febrile infections.
After adjusting the analysis by area of residence, doubling the relative
transcript unit (RTU) of varC and PfSir2a was associated with a 29.7 (95% CI
4.6-192.3) and 8.5 (95% CI 1.9-32.2) fold increases, respectively, of the odds of
being afebrile. In contrast, doubling the RTU of varB and DC8 was associated with
a 0.8 (95% CI 0.05-0.6) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.04-0.6) fold changes, respectively, of 
the odds of being afebrile. No significant differences were found for Pfs25
transcript levels in P. falciparum isolates from afebrile and febrile
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: var and gametocyte-specific transcript patterns in febrile and
afebrile infections from southern Mozambique matched by age, parasite density and
recruitment period suggest similar transmissibility but differential expression
of variant antigens involved in cytoadhesion and immune-evasion.
