The critical first step in the clinical development of a malaria vaccine, based
on live-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites, is the guarantee of
complete arrest in the liver. We report on an approach for assessing adequacy of 
attenuation of genetically attenuated sporozoites in vivo using the Plasmodium
berghei model of malaria and P. falciparum sporozoites cultured in primary human 
hepatocytes. We show that two genetically attenuated sporozoite vaccine
candidates, Δp52+p36 and Δfabb/f, are not adequately attenuated. Sporozoites
infection of mice with both P. berghei candidates can result in blood infections.
We also provide evidence that P. falciparum sporozoites of the leading vaccine
candidate that is similarly attenuated through the deletion of the genes encoding
the proteins P52 and P36, can develop into replicating liver stages. Therefore,
we propose a minimal set of screening criteria to assess adequacy of sporozoite
attenuation necessary before advancing into further clinical development and
studies in humans.
