Over the last years, an expanding family of small regulatory RNAs (e.g.
microRNAs, siRNAs and piRNAs) was recognized as key players in novel forms of
post-transcriptional gene regulation in most eukaryotes. However, the machinery
associated with Ago/Dicer-dependent small RNA biogenesis was thought to be either
entirely lost or extensively simplified in some unicellular organisms including
Trypanosoma cruzi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Leishmania major and Plasmodium
falciparum. Although the biogenesis of small RNAs from non-coding RNAs represent 
a minor fraction of the normal small RNA transcriptome in eukaryotic cells, they 
represent the unique small RNA pathways in Trypanosoma cruzi which produce
different populations of small RNAs derived from tRNAs, rRNAs, sn/snoRNAs and
mRNAs. These small RNAs are secreted included in extracellular vesicles and
transferred to other parasites and susceptible mammalian cells. This process
represents a novel form of cross-kingdom transfer of genetic material suggesting 
that secreted vesicles could represent new relevant pieces in life cycle
transitions, infectivity and cell-to-cell communication. Here, we provide for the
first time a detailed analysis of the small RNA cargo of extracellular vesicles
from T. cruzi epimastigotes under nutritional stress conditions compared to the
respective intracellular compartment using deep sequencing. Compared with the
intracellular compartment, shed extracellular vesicles showed a specific
extracellular signature conformed by distinctive patterns of small RNAs derived
from rRNA, tRNA, sno/snRNAs and protein coding sequences which evidenced specific
secretory small RNA processing pathways.
