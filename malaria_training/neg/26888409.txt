BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance seriously threatens the efficacy of vector
control interventions in malaria endemic countries. In Afghanistan, the status of
insecticide resistance is largely unknown while distribution of long-lasting
insecticidal nets has intensified in recent years. The main objective of this
study was thus to measure the level of resistance to four classes of insecticides
in provinces with medium to high risk of malaria transmission.
METHODS: Adult female mosquitoes were reared from larvae successively collected
in the provinces of Nangarhar, Kunar, Badakhshan, Ghazni and Laghman from August 
to October 2014. WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed with DDT (4 
%), malathion (5 %), bendiocarb (0.1 %), permethrin (0.75 %) and deltamethrin
(0.05 %). In addition, the presence of kdr mutations was investigated in
deltamethrin resistant and susceptible Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes collected
in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar.
RESULTS: Analyses of mortality rates revealed emerging resistance against all
four classes of insecticides in the provinces located east and south of the Hindu
Kush mountain range. Resistance is observed in both An. stephensi and Anopheles
culicifacies, the two dominant malaria vectors in these provinces. Anopheles
superpictus in the northern province of Badakhshan shows a different pattern of
susceptibility with suspected resistance observed only for deltamethrin and
bendiocarb. Genotype analysis of knock down resistance (kdr) mutations at the
voltage-gated channel gene from An. stephensi mosquitoes shows the presence of
the known resistant alleles L1014S and L1014F. However, a significant fraction of
deltamethrin-resistant mosquitoes were homozygous for the 1014L wild type allele 
indicating that other mechanisms must be considered to account for the observed
pyrethroid resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of monitoring insecticide
resistance for the development of an integrated vector management in Afghanistan.
The validation of the kdr genotyping PCR assay applied to An. stephensi collected
in Afghanistan paves the way for further studies into the mechanisms of
insecticide resistance of malaria vectors in this region.
