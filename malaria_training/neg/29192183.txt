Antimalarial drug resistance is a major global challenge in malaria control and
elimination. Mutations in six different genes of Plasmodium falciparum (crt,
mdr1, dhfr, dhps, ATPase6 and K-13 propeller) that confer resistance to
chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin-based combination therapy
were analyzed in samples from Chhattisgarh. Seventy-eight percent of the samples 
were found to have a pfcrt mutation (53% double, 24% triple and 1% single
mutant), and 59% of pfmdr1 genes were found to have an N86Y mutation. Double
mutations were recorded in pfdhfr gene among 76% of the samples while only 6% of 
the samples harbored mutant genotypes in pfdhps. No mutation was found in the
K-13 propeller gene, while only one sample showed a mutant genotype for the
PfATPase6 gene. The Tajima test confirmed that there is no role of evolutionary
natural selection in drug resistance, and gene pairwise linkage of disequilibrium
showed significant intragenic association. The high level of pfcrt mutations
suggests that parasite resistance to chloroquine is almost at a fixed level,
whereas resistance to SP is evolving in the population and parasites remain
sensitive to artemisinin derivatives. These findings provide potential
information and understanding of the evolution and spread of different drug
resistance alleles in Chhattisgarh.
