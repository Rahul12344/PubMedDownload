The inner membrane complex and the apical secretory organelles are defining
features of apicomplexan parasites. Despite their critical roles, the mechanisms 
behind the biogenesis of these structures in the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum are still poorly defined. We here show that decreasing expression of
the P. falciparum homologue of the conserved endolysomal escorter Sortilin-VPS10 
prevents the formation of the inner membrane complex and abrogates the generation
of new merozoites. Moreover, protein trafficking to the rhoptries, the
micronemes, and the dense granules is disrupted, which leads to the accumulation 
of apical complex proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and the parasitophorous
vacuole. We further show that protein export to the erythrocyte and transport
through the constitutive secretory pathway are functional. Taken together, our
results suggest that the malaria parasite P. falciparum Sortilin has potentially 
broader functions than most of its other eukaryotic counterparts.
