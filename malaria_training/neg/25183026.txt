Study of host pharmacogenetics can improve our knowledge of mechanisms of drug
resistance selection and spread. This issue has recently been addressed with
respect to chloroquine and amodiaquine in malaria endemic areas of West and East 
Africa. Here we report, from surveys performed in two different areas of Uganda, 
that the human CYP2C8*3 allele, which had been reported to be strongly associated
with parasite drug resistance in Zanzibar, is absent, being a marker of genetic
admixture of the Zanzibari population with a Caucasoid component. Moreover, a
retrospective analysis of CYP2C8*2 and the Plasmodium falciparum drug resistant
pfmdr1 86Y allele does not show any association, which may be related to the high
level of drug resistance.
