BACKGROUND: Differentiation of lymphocytes is frequently accompanied by cell
cycle changes, interplay that is of central importance for immunity but is still 
incompletely understood. Here, we interrogate and quantitatively model how
proliferation is linked to differentiation in CD4+ T cells.
RESULTS: We perform ex vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD4+ T cells during a
mouse model of infection that elicits a type 2 immune response and infer that the
differentiated, cytokine-producing cells cycle faster than early activated
precursor cells. To dissect this phenomenon quantitatively, we determine
expression profiles across consecutive generations of differentiated and
undifferentiated cells during Th2 polarization in vitro. We predict three
discrete cell states, which we verify by single-cell quantitative PCR. Based on
these three states, we extract rates of death, division and differentiation with 
a branching state Markov model to describe the cell population dynamics. From
this multi-scale modelling, we infer a significant acceleration in proliferation 
from the intermediate activated cell state to the mature cytokine-secreting
effector state. We confirm this acceleration both by live imaging of single Th2
cells and in an ex vivo Th1 malaria model by single-cell RNA-sequencing.
CONCLUSION: The link between cytokine secretion and proliferation rate holds both
in Th1 and Th2 cells in vivo and in vitro, indicating that this is likely a
general phenomenon in adaptive immunity.
