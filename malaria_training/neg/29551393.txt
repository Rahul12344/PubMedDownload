In low-endemic areas for malaria transmission, asymptomatic individuals play an
important role as reservoirs for malarial infection. Understanding the dynamics
of asymptomatic malaria is crucial for its efficient control in these regions.
Genetic host factors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms may play a
role in the maintenance or elimination of infection. In this study, the effect of
TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malaria was investigated among
individuals living in the Atlantic Forest of São Paulo, Southern Brazil. A
hundred and ninety-five Brazilian individuals were enrolled and actively followed
up for malaria for three years. Twenty-four polymorphisms in five toll-like
receptor (TLR) genes were genotyped by RFLP, direct sequencing or fragment
analysis. The genotypes were analyzed for the risk of malaria. Ongoing Plasmodium
vivax or P. malariae infection, was identified by the positive results in PCR
tests and previous P. vivax malaria, was assumed when antiplasmodial antibodies
against PvMSP119 were detected by ELISA. An evaluation of genomic ancestry was
conducted using biallelic ancestry informative markers and the results were used 
as correction in the statistical analysis. Nine SNPs and one microsatellite were 
found polymorphic and three variant alleles in TLR genes were associated to
malaria susceptibility. The regression coefficient estimated for SNP
TLR9.-1237.T/C indicated that the presence of at least one allele C increased, on
average, 2.3 times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C in 
this SNP. However, for individuals with the same sex, age and household, the
presence of at least one allele C in SNP TLR9.-1486.T/C reduced, on average, 1.9 
times the malaria odds, compared to individuals with no allele C. Moreover, this 
allele C plus an S allele in TLR6.P249S in individuals with same sex, age and
ancestry, reduced, on average, 4.4 times the malaria odds. Our findings indicate 
a significant association of TLR9.-1237.T/C gene polymorphism with malarial
infection and contribute to a better knowledge of the role of TLRs in malaria
susceptibility in an epidemiological setting different from other settings.
