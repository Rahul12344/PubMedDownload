BACKGROUND: A report of the chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance pfcrt-SVMNT
haplotype in Tanzania raises concern about high-level resistance to the
artesunate-amodiaquine combination treatment widely employed in Africa. Mutations
in the pfmdr1 multi-drug resistance gene may also be associated with resistance, 
and a highly polymorphic microsatellite (ms-4760) of the pfnhe1 gene involved in 
quinine susceptibility has not been surveyed in Tanzania.
METHODS: A total of 234 samples collected between 2003 - 2006 from an
observational birth cohort of young children in Muheza, Tanzania were analysed.
In these children, 141 cases of P. falciparum infections were treated with AQ and
93 episodes were treated with QN. Haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1 were determined 
by a Taqman assay, and ms-4760 repeats in pfnhe1 were assessed by nested PCR
amplification and direct sequencing. Parasite population diversity was evaluated 
using microsatellite markers on five different chromosomes.
RESULTS: The pfcrt-CVIET haplotype was present alone in 93.6% (219/234) of the
samples over the study period; the wild-type chloroquine- and
amodiaquine-sensitive haplotype pfcrt-CVMNK was present in 4.3% (10/234) of the
samples; and both haplotypes were present in 2.1% (5/234) of the samples. No
significant change in wild-type pfcrt-CVMNK prevalence was evident over the
4-year period of the study. The pfcrt-SVMNT haplotype associated with high-level 
amodiaquine resistance was not detected in this study. The pfmdr1 locus was
genotyped in 178 of these samples. The pfmdr1-YYNY haplotype predominated in
67.4% (120/178) of infections and was significantly associated with the
pfcrt-CVIET haplotype. All samples carried the wild-type pfmdr1-N1042 codon. The 
ms-4760 repeat on pfnhe1 locus displayed 12 distinct haplotypes with ms-4760-1
predominating in the population. Analysis of these haplotypes showed no
association of a particular haplotype with quinine treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION: The pfcrt-CVIET chloroquine resistance haplotype dominated in the
collection of P. falciparum samples from Muheza. The pfcrt-SVMNT haplotype, which
threatens the efficacy of amodiaquine and was reported in the same time period
from Korogwe, Tanzania, 40 Km from Muheza, was not detected. Relative low
prevalence of pfcrt-SVMNT in Africa may result from genetic or other factors
rendering P. falciparum less supportive of this haplotype than in South America
or other regions.
