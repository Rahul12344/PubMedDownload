PfSUB3 is the third subtilisin-like protease annotated in Plasmodium genome
database "PlasmoDB". The other two members, PfSUB1 and PfSUB2 have been
implicated in merozoite egress and invasion in asexual blood stages. In this
study, we recombinantly expressed a region of PfSUB3 spanning from Asn(334) to
Glu(769) (PfSUB3c) which encompassed the predicted catalytic domain with all the 
active site residues and predicted mature region spanning from Thr(516) to
Glu(769) (PfSUB3m) in E. coli. PfSUB3m showed PMSF-sensitive proteolytic activity
in in vitro assays. Replacement of active site serine with alanine in PfSUB3m
resulted in inactive protein. We found that PfSUB3c and PfSUB3m undergo
truncation to produce a 25-kDa species which was sufficient for proteolytic
activity. Quantitative real-time PCR, immnufluorescence assay and Western blot
analyses revealed that PfSUB3 is expressed at late asexual blood stages. Serine
protease activity of PfSUB3 and its expression in the late stages of erythrocytic
schizogony are indicative of some possible role of the protease in merozoite
egress and/or invasion processes.
