BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The pathology causing stages of the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum reside within red blood cells that are devoid of
any regulated transport system. The parasite, therefore, is entirely responsible 
for mediating vesicular transport within itself and in the infected erythrocyte
cytoplasm, and it does so in part via its family of 11 Rab GTPases. Putative
functions have been ascribed to Plasmodium Rabs due to their homology with Rabs
of yeast, particularly with Saccharomyces that has an equivalent number of
rab/ypt genes and where analyses of Ypt function is well characterized.
RESULTS: Rabs are important regulators of vesicular traffic due to their capacity
to recruit specific effectors. In order to identify P. falciparum Rab (PfRab)
effectors, we first built a Ypt-interactome by exploiting genetic and physical
binding data available at the Saccharomyces genome database (SGD). We then
constructed a PfRab-interactome using putative parasite Rab-effectors identified 
by homology to Ypt-effectors. We demonstrate its potential by wet-bench testing
three predictions; that casein kinase-1 (PfCK1) is a specific Rab5B interacting
protein and that the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A
(PfPKA-C) is a PfRab5A and PfRab7 effector.
CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a shared set of physical Ypt/PfRab-effector
proteins sheds light on a core set Plasmodium Rab-interactants shared with yeast.
The PfRab-interactome should benefit vesicular trafficking studies in malaria
parasites. The recruitment of PfCK1 to PfRab5B+ and PfPKA-C to PfRab5A+ and
PfRab7+ vesicles, respectively, suggests that PfRab-recruited kinases potentially
play a role in early and late endosome function in malaria parasites.
