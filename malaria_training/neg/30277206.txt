Artemisinin resistance, presently confined to Southeast Asia and associated with 
mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum K13 (PfK13) propeller domain, represents a
serious threat to global malaria control. This study aimed to provide baseline
information for future artemisinin resistance surveillance, by analyzing the
PfK13 propeller domain in P. falciparum field isolates collected from the
Brazilian Amazon Basin between 1984 and 2011. A total of 152 P. falciparum
mono-infections were assessed, of which 118 (78%) were collected before and 34
(22%) after the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in
2006. An 849-base pair fragment encoding the PfK13 propeller was amplified by
nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in both directions. The sequences 
were compared with the reference sequence of P. falciparum 3D7. All samples
showed wild-type sequences, thus, no mutations were observed. The results are in 
agreement with other recent reports and do not provide evidence for presence of
PfK13 propeller domain polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance among
P. falciparum field isolates in the Brazilian Amazon Basin neither before nor
after the implementation of ACT.
