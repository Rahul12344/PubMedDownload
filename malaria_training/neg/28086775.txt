BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in the
countries of the Greater Mekong sub-region posing a serious threat to global
malaria elimination efforts. The relationship of artemisinin resistance to
treatment failure has been unclear.
METHODS: In annual studies conducted in three malaria endemic provinces in the
south of Vietnam (Binh Phuoc, Ninh Thuan and Gia Lai) between 2011 and 2015, 489 
patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled in detailed
clinical, parasitological and molecular therapeutic response assessments with
42 days follow up. Patients received the national recommended first-line
treatment dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for three days.
RESULTS: Over the 5 years the proportion of patients with detectable parasitaemia
on day 3 rose steadily from 38 to 57% (P < 0.001). In Binh Phuoc province, the
parasite clearance half-life increased from 3.75 h in 2011 to 6.60 h in 2015
(P < 0.001), while treatment failures rose from 0% in 2012 and 2013, to 7% in
2014 and 26% in 2015 (P < 0.001). Recrudescence was associated with in vitro
evidence of artemisinin and piperaquine resistance. In the treatment failures
cases of 2015, all 14 parasite isolates carried the C580Y Pfkelch 13 gene, marker
of artemisinin resistance and 93% (13/14) of them carried exoE415G mutations,
markers of piperaquine resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: In the south of Vietnam recent emergence of piperaquine resistant P.
falciparum strains has accelerated the reduced response to artemisinin and has
led to treatment failure rates of up to 26% to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine,
Vietnam's current first-line ACT. Alternative treatments are urgently needed.
