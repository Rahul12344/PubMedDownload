BACKGROUND: Carboxy-terminal 42 kDa region of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface 
protein-1 is considered as an important antigen in blood stage. Since, this
region has been observed to be polymorphic among isolates of P. vivax, it is
significant to survey on different regions of this antigen in various areas of
the world.
METHODS: In the present study, the genetic diversity of cloned PvMSP-142 kDa gene
from an Iranian patient is analyzed. Parasite DNA was extracted from a P. vivax -
infected patient in Iran. The region of PvMSP-142 kDa was amplified by PCR,
cloned into pTZ57R/T vector and then sequenced.
RESULTS: Sequencing of cloned PvMSP-142 kDa gene clearly has a high degree of
homology (95%) with reference Sal-I sequence and also with the homogeneous
sequences from some studied countries (97%). Thirty eight SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphism) were identified in cloned PvMSP-142 kDa gene which the mutations
had localized in the 33 kDa fragment (PvMSP-133 kDa), while there was nearly no
variation in the 19 kDa fragment (PvMSP-119 kDa). 2 out of 38 mutations were
found as to be novel haplotypes.
CONCLUSION: High similarity of cloned PvMSP-142 kDa gene in comparison to
reference sequence and other sequences could be beneficial as a remarkable
molecular marker for serological diagnostic kits of P. vivax in malarious
neighboring countries of Iran and around the world.
