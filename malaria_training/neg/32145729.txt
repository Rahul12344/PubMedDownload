Majority of the imported malaria cases in Korea is attributed to Plasmodium
falciparum and P. vivax infections, whereas P. malariae and P. ovale infections
are very rare. Falciparum and ovale malaria are mostly imported from Africa,
while most of the vivax malaria cases are imported from Southeast Asia. Here, we 
report 6 Korean imported ovale malaria cases (4 males and 2 females) who had
visited in Africa during 2013-2016. These subjects were diagnosed with P. ovale
based on microscopic findings, Plasmodium species-specific nested-PCR, and
phylogenetic clade using 18S rRNA gene sequences. We identified 2 P. ovale
subtypes, 1 P. ovale curtisi (classic type) and 5 P. ovale wallikeri (variant
type). All patients were treated with chloroquine and primaquine, and no relapse 
or recrudescence was reported for 1 year after treatment. With increase of
travelers to the countries where existing Plasmodium species, the risk of
Plasmodium infection is also increasing. Molecular monitoring for imported
malaria parasites should be rigorously and continuously performed to enable
diagnosis and certification of Plasmodium spp.
