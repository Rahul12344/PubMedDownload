Mosquitoes have a multifaceted innate immune system that is actively engaged in
warding off various pathogens, including the protozoan malaria parasite
Plasmodium. Various immune signaling pathways and effectors have been shown to
mediate a certain degree of defense specificity against different Plasmodium
species. A key pattern recognition receptor of the Anopheles gambiae immune
system is the fibrinogen domain-containing immunolectin FBN9, which has been
shown to be transcriptonally induced by Plasmodium infection, and to mediate
defense against both rodent and human malaria parasites and bacteria. Here we
have further studied the defense specificity of FBN9 using a transgenic approach,
in which FBN9 is overexpressed in the fat body tissue after a blood meal through 
a vitellogenin promoter. Interestingly, the Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes showed 
increased resistance only to the rodent parasite P. berghei, and not to the human
parasite P. falciparum, pointing to differences in the mosquito's defense
mechanisms against the two parasite species. The Vg-FBN9 transgenic mosquitoes
were also more resistant to infection with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria and showed increased longevity when infected with P. berghei. Our study 
points to the importance of both experimentally depleting and enriching candidate
anti-Plasmodium effectors in functional studies in order to ascertain their
suitability for the development of transgenic mosquito-based malaria control
strategies.
