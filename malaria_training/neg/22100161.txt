Many microbial pathogens, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,
vary surface protein expression to evade host immune responses. P. falciparium
antigenic variation is linked to var gene family-encoded clonally variant surface
protein expression. Mututally exclusive var gene expression is partially
controlled by spatial positioning; silent genes are retained at distinct
perinuclear sites and relocated to transcriptionally active locations for
monoallelic expression. We show that var introns can control this process and
that var intron addition relocalizes episomes from a random to a perinuclear
position. This var intron-regulated nuclear tethering and repositioning is linked
to an 18 bp nuclear protein-binding element that recruits an actin protein
complex. Pharmacologically induced F-actin formation, which is restricted to the 
nuclear periphery, repositions intron-carrying episomes and var genes and
disrupts mutually exclusive var gene expression. Thus, actin polymerization
relocates var genes from a repressive to an active perinuclear compartment, which
is crucial for P. falciparium phenotypic variation and pathogenesis.
