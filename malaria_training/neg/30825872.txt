Intravital microscopy allows the visualisation of how pathogens interact with
host cells and tissues in living animals in real time. This method has enabled
key advances in our understanding of host-parasite interactions under
physiological conditions. A combination of genetics, microscopy techniques, and
image analysis have recently facilitated the understanding of biological
phenomena in living animals at cellular and subcellular resolution. In this
review, we summarise findings achieved by intravital microscopy of the skin and
adipose tissues upon infection with various parasites, and we present a view into
possible future applications of this method.
