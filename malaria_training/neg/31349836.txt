BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance of Anopheles stephensi, the main malaria
vector in eastern Afghanistan, has been reported previously. This study describes
the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of resistance to facilitate effective
vector control and insecticide resistance management.
METHODS: Mosquito larvae were collected from the provinces of Kunar, Laghman and 
Nangarhar from 2014 to 2017. The susceptibility of the reared 3-4Â days old adults
was tested with deltamethrin 0.05%, bendiocarb 0.1%, malathion 5%, permethrin
0.75% and DDT 4%. Cytochrome P450 content and general esterase, glutathione
S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were measured in
the three field populations and the results were compared with those of the
laboratory susceptible An. stephensi Beech strain. Two separate allele-specific
PCR assays were used to identify L1014, L1014F and L1014S mutations in the
voltage gated sodium channel gene of An. stephensi. Probit analysis, ANOVA and
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were used to analyse bioassay, biochemical assay and
gene frequency data respectively.
RESULTS: The population of An. stephensi from Kunar was susceptible to
bendiocarb, apart from this, all populations were resistant to all the other
insecticides tested. The differences between all values for cytochrome P450s,
general esterases, GSTs and AChE inhibition rates in the Kunar, Laghman and
Nangarhar populations were statistically significant when compared to the Beech
strain, excluding GST activities between Kunar and Beech due to the high standard
deviation in Kunar. The three different sodium channel alleles [L1014 (wild
type), L1014F (kdr west) and L1014S (kdr east)] were all segregated in the Afghan
populations. The frequencies of kdr east mutation were 22.9%, 32.7% and 35% in
Kunar, Laghman and Nangarhar populations respectively. Kdr west was at the lowest
frequency of 4.44%.
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to different groups of insecticides in the field
populations of An. stephensi from Kunar, Laghman and Nangarhar Provinces of
Afghanistan is caused by a range of metabolic and site insensitivity mechanisms, 
including esterases, cytochrome P450s and GSTs combined with AChE and sodium
channel target site insensitivity. The intensity and frequency of these
mechanisms are increasing in these populations, calling for urgent reorientation 
of vector control programmes and implementation of insecticide resistance
management strategies.
