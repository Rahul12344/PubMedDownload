Artesunate (AS), a semisynthetic artemisinin approved for malaria therapy,
inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication in vitro, but therapeutic
success in humans has been variable. We hypothesized that the short in vivo
half-life of AS may contribute to the different treatment outcomes. We tested
novel synthetic ozonides with longer half-lives against HCMV in vitro and mouse
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in vivo Screening of the activities of four ozonides
against a pp28-luciferase-expressing HCMV Towne recombinant identified OZ418 to
have the best selectivity; its effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by
50% (EC50) was 9.8 ± 0.2 µM, and cytotoxicity in noninfected human fibroblasts
(the concentration inhibiting cell growth by 50% [CC50]) was 128.1 ± 8.0 µM. In
plaque reduction assays, OZ418 inhibited HCMV TB40 in a concentration-dependent
manner as well as a ganciclovir (GCV)-resistant HCMV isolate. The combination of 
OZ418 and GCV was synergistic in HCMV inhibition in vitro Virus inhibition by
OZ418 occurred at an early stage and was dependent on the cell density at the
time of infection. OZ418 treatment reversed HCMV-mediated cell cycle progression 
and correlated with the reduction of HCMV-induced expression of pRb, E2F1, and
cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 2, 4, and 6. In an MCMV model, once-daily oral
administration of OZ418 had significantly improved efficacy against MCMV compared
to that of twice-daily oral AS. A parallel pharmacokinetic study with a single
oral dose of OZ418 or AS showed a prolonged plasma half-life and higher unbound
concentrations of OZ418 than unbound concentrations of AS. In summary, ozonides
are proposed to be potential therapeutics, alone or in combination with GCV, for 
HCMV infection in humans.
