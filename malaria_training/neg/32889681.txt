BACKGROUND: Several insects such as mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, lice, and
mites are known to serve as vectors for a vast number of pathogens. Many such
vectors are hematophagous, and therefore introduce pathogens directly into the
host's bloodstream. Importantly, the capacity of these vectors to spread disease 
can lead to serious global health crises. Furthermore, crop damage can be
exacerbated by pathogen infection and increased insect foraging due to recent
global warming.
METHODS: Our study categorized insect-associated damage into three groups: animal
infection, plant infection, and direct crop damage due to insect foraging. To
manage these problems, insect repellents and pesticides have been developed,
among which DEET is the most broadly used and studied pest control agent. This
review discusses the mode of action and possible mechanisms of DEET action,
including olfactory and gustatory mechanisms and central nervous system
impairment.
CONCLUSION: To protect humans from malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, zika, and
filariasis, as well as to reduce economic losses associated with crop damage,
considerably more efforts are needed to characterize the interactions between
insects and insect repellents/pesticides to develop more potent pest control
agents.
