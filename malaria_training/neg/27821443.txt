The HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir inhibits Plasmodium falciparum aspartic
proteases (plasmepsins) and parasite development, and children receiving
lopinavir-ritonavir experienced fewer episodes of malaria than those receiving
other antiretroviral regimens. Resistance to lopinavir was selected in vitro over
∼9 months, with ∼4-fold decreased sensitivity. Whole-genome sequencing of
resistant parasites showed a mutation and increased copy number in pfmdr1 and a
mutation in a protein of unknown function, but no polymorphisms in plasmepsin
genes.
