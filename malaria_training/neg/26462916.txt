BACKGROUND: The genome-wide association study (GWAS) techniques that have been
used for genetic mapping in other organisms have not been successfully applied to
mosquitoes, which have genetic characteristics of high nucleotide diversity, low 
linkage disequilibrium, and complex population stratification that render
population-based GWAS essentially unfeasible at realistic sample size and marker 
density.
METHODS: We designed a novel mapping strategy for the mosquito system that
combines the power of linkage mapping with the resolution afforded by genetic
association. We established founder colonies from West Africa, controlled for
diversity, linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Colonies were
challenged by feeding on the infectious stage of the human malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum, mosquitoes were phenotyped for parasite load, and DNA
pools for phenotypically similar mosquitoes were Illumina sequenced.
Phenotype-genotype mapping was carried out in two stages, coarse and fine.
RESULTS: In the first mapping stage, pooled sequences were analysed genome-wide
for intervals displaying relativereduction in diversity between phenotype pools, 
and candidate genomic loci were identified for influence upon parasite infection 
levels. In the second mapping stage, focused genotyping of SNPs from the first
mapping stage was carried out in unpooled individual mosquitoes and replicates.
The second stage confirmed significant SNPs in a locus encoding two Toll-family
proteins. RNAi-mediated gene silencing and infection challenge revealed that TOLL
11 protects mosquitoes against P. falciparum infection.
CONCLUSIONS: We present an efficient and cost-effective method for genetic
mapping using natural variation segregating in defined recent Anopheles founder
colonies, and demonstrate its applicability for mapping in a complex non-model
genome. This approach is a practical and preferred alternative to
population-based GWAS for first-pass mapping of phenotypes in Anopheles. This
design should facilitate mapping of other traits involved in physiology,
epidemiology, and behaviour.
