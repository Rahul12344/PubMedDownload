Background: As a result of the spread of parasites resistant to antimalarial
drugs, Malaria treatment guidelines in Cameroon evolved from nonartemisinin
monotherapy to artemisinin-based combination therapy. The aim of this study was
to assess the effect of these therapy changes on the prevalence of molecular
markers of resistance from 2003 to 2013 in Mutengene, Cameroon.
Methodology: Dry blood samples (collected in 2003-2005 and 2009-2013) were used
for parasite DNA extraction. Drug resistance genes were amplified by PCR and
hybridized with oligonucleotide probes or subjected to restriction digestion. The
prevalence of individual marker polymorphisms and haplotypes was compared in
these two study periods using the Chi square test.
Results: Alleles conferring resistance to 4-aminoquinolines in the Pfcrt 76T and 
Pfmdr1 86Y, 184F, and 1246Y genotypes showed a significant reduction of 97.0% to 
66.9%, 83.6% to 45.2%, 97.3% to 56.0%, and 3.1% to 0.0%, respectively (P < 0.05).
No difference was observed in SNPs associated with antifolate drugs resistance
51I, 59R, 108N, or 540E (P > 0.05). Haplotype analysis in the Pfmdr1 gene showed 
a reduction in the YFD from 75.90% to 42.2%, P < 0.0001, and an increase in the
NYD (2.9% to 30.1%;  P < 0.0001).
Conclusions: The results indicated a gradual return of the 4-aminoquinoline
sensitive genotype while the antifolate resistant genotypes increased to
saturation.
