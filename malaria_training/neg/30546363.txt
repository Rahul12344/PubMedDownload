Sand flies bite mammalian hosts to obtain a blood meal, driving changes in the
host inflammatory response that support the establishment of Leishmania
infection. This effect is partially attributed to components of sand fly saliva, 
which are able to recruit and activate leukocytes. Our group has shown that heme 
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) favors Leishmania survival in infected cells by reducing
inflammatory responses. Here, we show that exposure to sand fly bites is
associated with induction of HO-1 in vivo. Histopathological analyses of skin
specimens from human volunteers experimentally exposed to sand fly bites revealed
that HO-1 and Nrf2 are produced at bite sites in the skin. These results were
recapitulated in mice ears injected with a salivary gland sonicate (SGS) or
exposed to sand fly bites, indicating that vector saliva may be a key factor in
triggering HO-1 expression. Resident skin macrophages were the main source HO-1
at 24-48 h after bites. Additionally, assays in vivo after bites and in vitro
after stimulation with saliva both demonstrated that HO-1 production by
macrophages was Nrf2-dependent. Collectively, our data demonstrates that vector
saliva induces early HO-1 production at the bite sites, representing a major
event associated with establishment of naturally-transmitted Leishmania
infections.
