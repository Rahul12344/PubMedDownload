BACKGROUND: Although a number of Plasmodium vivax proteins have been identified, 
few have been investigated as potential vaccine candidates. This study
characterized the Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface antigen 180 (PvMSA180,
PVX_094920), a novel P. vivax antigenic protein.
METHODS: The target gene was amplified as four overlapping domains (D1, D2, D3
and D4) to enable expression of the recombinant protein using cell-free and
bacterial expression systems. The recombinant PvMSA180 proteins were used in
protein microarrays to evaluate the humoral immune response of 72 vivax-infected 
patients and 24 vivax-naïve individuals. Antibodies produced in mice against the 
PvMSA180-D1 and -D4 domains were used to assess the subcellular localization of
schizont-stage parasites with immunofluorescence assays. A total of 51 pvmsa180
sequences from 12 countries (41 sequences from PlasmoDB and 6 generated in this
study) were used to determine the genetic diversity and genealogical
relationships with DNAsp and NETWORK software packages, respectively.
RESULTS: PvMSA180 consists of 1603 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of
182 kDa, and has a signal peptide at the amino-terminus. A total of 70.8% of
patients (51/72) showed a specific antibody response to at least one of the
PvMSA180 domains, and 20.8% (15/72) exhibited a robust antibody response to at
least three of the domains. These findings suggest that PvMSA180 is targeted by
the humoral immune response during natural infection with P. vivax.
Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that PvMSA180 is localized on the
merozoite surface of schizont-stage parasites, and pvmsa180 sequences originating
from various geographic regions worldwide showed low genetic diversity.
Twenty-two haplotypes were found, and haplotype 6 (Hap_6, 77%) of pvmsa180 was
detected in isolates from six countries.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel P. vivax surface protein, PvMSA180, was characterized in
this study. Most of P. vivax-infected patients had specific antibodies against
particular antigenic domains, indicating that this protein is immunogenic in
naturally exposed populations. Genetic analysis of worldwide isolates showed that
pvmsa180 is less polymorphic than other well-known candidates and that some
haplotypes are common to several countries. However, additional studies with a
larger sample size are necessary to evaluate the antibody responses in
geographically separated populations, and to identify the function of PvMSA180
during parasite invasion.
