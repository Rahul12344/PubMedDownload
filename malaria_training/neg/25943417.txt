Detecting natural selection signals in Plasmodium parasites antigens might be
used for identifying potential new vaccine candidates. Fifty-nine Plasmodium
vivax-Sal-I genes encoding proteins having a potential role in invasion were used
as query for identifying them in recent P. vivax strain genome sequences and two 
closely-related Plasmodium species. Several measures of DNA sequence variation
were then calculated and selection signatures were detected by using different
approaches. Our results may be used for determining which genes expressed during 
P. vivax merozoite stage could be prioritised for further population genetics or 
functional studies for designing a P. vivax vaccine which would avoid
allele-specific immune responses.
