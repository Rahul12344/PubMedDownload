BACKGROUND: The emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi in humans, which is in many
cases misdiagnosed by microscopy as Plasmodium malariae due to the morphological 
similarity has contributed to the needs of detection and differentiation of
malaria parasites. At present, nested PCR targeted on Plasmodium ssrRNA genes has
been described as the most sensitive and specific method for Plasmodium
detection. However, this method is costly and requires trained personnel for its 
implementation. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a novel nucleic
acid amplification method was developed for the clinical detection of P.
knowlesi. The sensitivity and specificity of LAMP was evaluated in comparison to 
the results obtained via microscopic examination and nested PCR.
METHODS: LAMP assay was developed based on P. knowlesi genetic material targeting
the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) gene. The method uses six primers that
recognize eight regions of the target DNA and it amplifies DNA within an hour
under isothermal conditions (65Â°C) in a water-bath.
RESULTS: LAMP is highly sensitive with the detection limit as low as ten copies
for AMA-1. LAMP detected malaria parasites in all confirm cases (n = 13) of P.
knowlesi infection (sensitivity, 100%) and none of the negative samples
(specificity, 100%) within an hour. LAMP demonstrated higher sensitivity compared
to nested PCR by successfully detecting a sample with very low parasitaemia (<
0.01%).
CONCLUSION: With continuous efforts in the optimization of this assay, LAMP may
provide a simple and reliable test for detecting P. knowlesi malaria parasites in
areas where malaria is prevalent.
