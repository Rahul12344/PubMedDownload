Currently, the national malaria control programme (NMCP) of Sierra Leone
recommends artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) as
first- and second-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, respectively, and
artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment
during pregnancy and for infants. In 2016, the NMCP conducted a study to assess
the clinical and parasitological responses of children under five years to ASAQ, 
AL and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/PPQ) according to the WHO protocol.
Day-0 samples were tested for mutations in the Kelch 13 gene (pfk13) and
dihydrofolate reductase/dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhfr/pfdhps) genes associated
with artemisinin and SP resistance, respectively, and amplification in the
pfplasmepsin2 gene for piperaquine resistance. A total of 295 (ASAQ = 128,
AL = 64 and DHA/PPQ = 103) eligible children were enrolled at three sites.
PCR-corrected 100% adequate clinical and parasitological response and no
parasitaemia on day-3 were observed for all patients in each treatment group. Of 
the 278 samples with interpretable molecular data, only 2.2% carried
non-synonymous pfk13 mutants (A578S, I646T), which are not associated with
artemisinin resistance. None of the 103 day-0 samples from the DAH/PPQ group had 
pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification, confirming the absence of piperaquine
resistance. The prevalence of the triple pfdhfr mutant (N51I/C59R/S108N) was
close to or reached fixation (97.4-100%). For combined pfdhfr/pfdhps mutation,
55-71% carried the quadruple (N51I/C59R/S108N+A437G) mutant and about 10% the
quintuple mutant N51I/C59R/S108N+A437G/K540E. Our findings confirm that ASAQ, AL 
and DHA/PPQ were highly effective for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in
the study areas, and neither pfk13 validated mutations nor pfplasmepsin2 multiple
copies were found. The very low prevalence of the quintuple mutant in this study 
supports the NMCP's decision to introduce intermittent preventive treatment for
infants with SP in the districts with high malaria transmission.
