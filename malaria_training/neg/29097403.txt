The identification of genomic rearrangements with high sensitivity and
specificity using massively parallel sequencing remains a major challenge,
particularly in precision medicine and cancer research. Here, we describe a new
method for detecting rearrangements, GRIDSS (Genome Rearrangement IDentification 
Software Suite). GRIDSS is a multithreaded structural variant (SV) caller that
performs efficient genome-wide break-end assembly prior to variant calling using 
a novel positional de Bruijn graph-based assembler. By combining assembly, split 
read, and read pair evidence using a probabilistic scoring, GRIDSS achieves high 
sensitivity and specificity on simulated, cell line, and patient tumor data,
recently winning SV subchallenge #5 of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM8.5 Somatic Mutation
Calling Challenge. On human cell line data, GRIDSS halves the false discovery
rate compared to other recent methods while matching or exceeding their
sensitivity. GRIDSS identifies nontemplate sequence insertions, microhomologies, 
and large imperfect homologies, estimates a quality score for each breakpoint,
stratifies calls into high or low confidence, and supports multisample analysis.
