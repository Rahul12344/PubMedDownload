With the intention of investigating the DNA strand displacement properties of
Plasmodium falciparum helicase PfeIF4A (formerly known as PfH45) a
codon-optimized gene for expression in Escherichia coli has been produced.
Several histidine-containing proteins with intrinsic helicase activity were
captured from the bacterial sonicate by initial Ni(2+)-chromatography. Heparin
and size-exclusion steps were subsequently required for unambiguous PfeIF4A
purification. This strategy generated an active recombinant protein of
significantly improved yield in comparison to previously published studies (~4.2 
mg/g wet weight of cells). Helicase unwinding assays confirmed a bipolar
activity, but revealed a preference for unwinding a free 3'-end, with a rate of
displacement in the 3'-5' direction 2-fold higher than that in the 5'-3'
direction. DNA constructs with two, three or four blunt ends were not unwound.
Studies confirmed the enzyme to be Mg(2+)-dependent, optimally active at 37°C and
had a background ATP turnover rate of 23.16±1.74 pmol/min, which in the presence 
of single- or double-stranded DNA doubled to 42.92±3.21 pmol/min.
