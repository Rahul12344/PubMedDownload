The emergence and spread of drug resistance is a problem hindering malaria
elimination in Southeast Asia. In this study, genetic variations in drug
resistance markers of Plasmodium falciparum were determined in parasites from
asymptomatic populations located in three geographically dispersed townships of
Myanmar by PCR and sequencing. Mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr),
dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt),
multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 
1 (pfmrp1), and Kelch protein 13 (k13) were present in 92.3%, 97.6%, 84.0%,
98.8%, and 68.3% of the parasites, respectively. The pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y,
pfmdr1 I185K, and pfmrp1 I876V mutations were present in 82.7%, 2.5%, 87.5%, and 
59.8% isolates, respectively. The most prevalent haplotypes for pfdhfr, pfdhps,
pfcrt and pfmdr1 were 51I/59R/108N/164L, 436A/437G/540E/581A,
74I/75E/76T/220S/271E/326N/356T/371I, and 86N/130E/184Y/185K/1225V, respectively.
In addition, 57 isolates had three different point mutations (K191T, F446I, and
P574L) and three types of N-terminal insertions (N, NN, NNN) in the k13 gene. In 
total, 43 distinct haplotypes potentially associated with multidrug resistance
were identified. These findings demonstrate a high prevalence of
multidrug-resistant P. falciparum in asymptomatic infections from diverse
townships in Myanmar, emphasizing the importance of targeting asymptomatic
infections to prevent the spread of drug-resistant P. falciparum.
