Annotating and understanding the function of proteins and other elements in a
genome can be difficult in the absence of a well-studied and evolutionarily close
relative. The causative agent of malaria, one of the oldest and most deadly
global infectious diseases, is a good example of this problem. The burden of
malaria is huge and there is a pressing need for new, more effective antimalarial
strategies. However, techniques such as homology-dependent annotation transfer
are severely impaired in this parasite because there are no well-understood close
relatives. To circumvent this approach we developed a network-based method that
uses a heavy path network-mining algorithm. We uncovered the protein-protein
associations that are implicated in important cellular processes including genome
integrity, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, invasion, and pathogenesis,
thus demonstrating the utility of this method. The URL of the source code for
super-sequence mining method is
