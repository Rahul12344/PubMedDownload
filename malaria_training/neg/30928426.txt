DARC is thought to act as a key invasion receptor in P. vivax malaria. It is
known that the expression of DARC and susceptibility to P. vivax malaria is
influenced by the presence of specific DARC genotypes. Studies have reported the 
low probability of P. vivax malaria in individuals carrying FyA allele due to the
significantly reduced binding of the P. vivax duffy binding protein. No
association of the allele frequency and severe vivax malaria epidemiology has
been yet established in our country. In the present study, a high level of
heterozygotes was observed with a statistically significant deviation from the
H-W equilibrium in the group with complicated malaria; which is indicative of
demographic disequilibrium. Significantly upregulated expression of the DARC
receptor in FyA/FyB heterozygote patients is suggestive of a greater receptor
repertoire responsible for the possible variation in the parasite ligand binding 
with the host receptor and thus might have a role to play in severe malaria.
