2011-2013.

Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin derivatives is emerging in Asia. 
We examined molecular markers of resistance in 78 children in Uganda who had
severe malaria and were treated with intravenous artesunate. We observed in the
K13-propeller domain, A578S, a low-frequency (3/78), nonsynonymous,
single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with prolonged parasite clearance.
