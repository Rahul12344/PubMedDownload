The vir genes are antigenic genes and are considered to be possible vaccine
targets. Since India is highly endemic to Plasmodium vivax, we sequenced 5
different vir genes and investigated DNA sequence variations in 93 single-clonal 
P. vivax isolates. High variability was observed in all the 5 vir genes; the vir 
1/9 gene was highly diverged across Indian populations. The patterns of genetic
diversity do not follow geographical locations, as geographically distant
populations were found to be genetically similar. The results in general present 
complex genetic diversity patterns in India, requiring further in-depth
population genetic and functional studies.
