Increasing antimalarial drug resistance once again threatens effective
antimalarial drug treatment, malaria control, and elimination. Artemisinin
combination therapies (ACTs) are first-line treatment for uncomplicated
falciparum malaria in all endemic countries, yet partial resistance to
artemisinins has emerged in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Concomitant emergence
of partner drug resistance is now causing high ACT treatment failure rates in
several areas. Genetic markers for artemisinin resistance and several of the
partner drugs have been established, greatly facilitating surveillance. Single
point mutations in the gene coding for the Kelch propeller domain of the K13
protein strongly correlate with artemisinin resistance. Novel regimens and
strategies using existing antimalarial drugs will be needed until novel compounds
can be deployed. Elimination of artemisinin resistance will imply elimination of 
all falciparum malaria from the same areas. In vivax malaria, chloroquine
resistance is an increasing problem.
