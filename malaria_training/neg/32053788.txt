Biological rhythms appear to be an elegant solution to the challenge of
coordinating activities with the consequences of the Earth's daily and seasonal
rotation. The genes and molecular mechanisms underpinning circadian clocks in
multicellular organisms are well understood. In contrast, the regulatory
mechanisms and fitness consequences of biological rhythms exhibited by parasites 
remain mysterious. Here, we explore how periodicity in parasite traits is
generated and why daily rhythms matter for parasite fitness. We focus on malaria 
(Plasmodium) parasites which exhibit developmental rhythms during replication in 
the mammalian host's blood and in transmission to vectors. Rhythmic in-host
parasite replication is responsible for eliciting inflammatory responses, the
severity of disease symptoms, and fueling transmission, as well as conferring
tolerance to anti-parasite drugs. Thus, understanding both how and why the timing
and synchrony of parasites are connected to the daily rhythms of hosts and
vectors may make treatment more effective and less toxic to hosts.
