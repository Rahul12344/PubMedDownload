Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) genomic regions have been suggested
to influence malaria pathogenesis and infection susceptibility. KIRs are known as
activating natural killer (NK) cell receptors, which upon binding to their
corresponding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands cause lysis of any infected
cell. We have examined the potential association of KIR genes with complicated
malaria (CM) among north Indians in this study and further evaluated the KIR
receptor-HLA ligand association on the severity of the disease considering the
uncomplicated malaria (UCM) subjects as control. Molecular profiling of KIR and
HLA was carried out using the PCR-SSP method. Susceptible association was found
for individuals possessing KIR2DS2 (OR=1.76, p-value=0.0390), KIR2DL1 (OR=2.87,
p-value=0.0005) and KIR2DL3 (OR=2.74, p-value=0.0011) genes with CM. This was
supported by the strong linkage disequilibrium observed for 2DS2-2DL2 (D́=0.87,
r2=0.54) with CM. Whereas the receptor-ligand association has revealed risk
association against KIR2DS2-HLAC1 (OR=2.08, p-value=0.0229), KIR2DL3-HLAC1
(OR=1.79, p-value=0.0301), and KIR2DL1-HLAC2 (OR=2.10, p-value=0.0175)
combinations for complicated malaria. The frequency of different KIR genes are
more or less similar to that observed in African population showing not much
genetic diversity at KIR level in context to malarial infection. In conclusion,
our data indicates KIR gene loci differentially influenced the malarial outcome
in north Indians and in particular the KIR2DS2 gene appeared to be associated
with disease severity.
