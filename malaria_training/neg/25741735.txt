Detection of thiol-based redox switch processes in parasites - facts and future.

Rahbari M, Diederich K, Becker K, Krauth-Siegel RL, Jortzik E.

Malaria and African trypanosomiasis are tropical diseases caused by the protozoa 
Plasmodium and Trypanosoma, respectively. The parasites undergo complex life
cycles in the mammalian host and insect vector, during which they are exposed to 
oxidative and nitrosative challenges induced by the host immune system and
endogenous processes. Attacking the parasite's redox metabolism is a target
mechanism of several known antiparasitic drugs and a promising approach to novel 
drug development. Apart from this aspect, oxidation of cysteine residues plays a 
key role in protein-protein interaction, metabolic responses to redox events, and
signaling. Understanding the role and dynamics of reactive oxygen species and
thiol switches in regulating cellular redox homeostasis is crucial for both basic
and applied biomedical approaches. Numerous techniques have therefore been
established to detect redox changes in parasites including biochemical methods,
fluorescent dyes, and genetically encoded probes. In this review, we aim to give 
an insight into the characteristics of redox networks in the pathogens Plasmodium
and Trypanosoma, including a comprehensive overview of the consequences of
specific deletions of redox-associated genes. Furthermore, we summarize
mechanisms and detection methods of thiol switches in both parasites and discuss 
their specificity and sensitivity.
