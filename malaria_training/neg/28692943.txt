Chloroquine (CQ) is highly effective against P. vivax, due to the rapid spread of
CQ resistance in P. falciparum parasites; it is no longer the drug of choice
against P. falciparum. This study elucidates the scenario of chloroquine efficacy
at times that coincided with a new drug policy and especially assessed the
chloroquine resistant molecular markers after withdrawal of chloroquine in
Kolkata and Purulia, two malaria endemic zones of West Bengal, India. In vitro CQ
susceptibility was tested in 781 patients with P. falciparum mono infections
between 2008 and 2013, of which 338 patients had received CQ in 2008-2009.
Genotyping of the pfcrt and the pfmdr1 gene was carried out in all isolates.
Early treatment failure was detected in 114 patients {43 (31·39%) from Kolkata
and 71 (35·32%) from Purulia} while recrudescence was identified in 13 (9.49%)
and 17 (8.46%) patients from Kolkata and Purulia respectively. In vivo
chloroquine resistance was strongly associated with CVMNT-YYSNY (p < 0.01) and
SVMNT-YYSNY (p < 0.05) allele in Kolkata. In Purulia chloroquine resistance was
associated with CVMNK-YYSNY (P < 0.005), SVMNT-YYSNY (P < 0.01) allele. The
proportion of in vitro chloroquine resistance increased in subsequent years to
87.23% and 93·10% in 2013, in Kolkata and Purulia, respectively. Isolates with
SVMNT-YFSND, SVMNT-YFSNY, CVIET-YFSND and CVIET-YYSNY haplotypes increased
gradually (p < 0.05) from 2010 to 2013, leading to a rise in IC50 (p < 0.05) of
chloroquine. An increase in in vitro chloroquine resistance and candidate gene
mutations even after five years of chloroquine withdrawal against P. falciparum
calls for synchronized research surveillance and proper containment strategies.
