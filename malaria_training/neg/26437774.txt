BACKGROUND: Persistence of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance has been
described in an urban setting in Malawi where malaria transmission is relatively 
low. Higher malaria transmission is associated with greater genetic diversity and
more frequent genetic recombination, which could lead to a more rapid
re-emergence of SP-sensitive parasites, as well as more rapid degradation of
selective sweeps. In this study, the impact of local variation in malaria
transmission on the prevalence of SP-resistant haplotypes and selective sweep
characteristics was investigated at an urban site with low parasite prevalence
and two rural sites with moderate and high parasite prevalence.
METHODS: Samples from three sites with different parasite prevalence were
genotyped for resistance markers within pfdhfr-ts and pfdhps and at
microsatellites flanking these genes. Expected heterozygosity (He) was estimated 
to evaluate genetic diversity.
RESULTS: No difference in the prevalence of highly resistant DHFR 51I/59R/108N
and DHPS 437G/540E was found between sites. Small differences in He flanking
pfdhfr-ts and pfdhps were seen between rural-moderate and the other sites, as
well as some shared haplotypes between the rural-high and urban-low sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not show an effect of local variation in malaria
transmission, as inferred from parasite prevalence, on SP-resistant haplotype
prevalence.
