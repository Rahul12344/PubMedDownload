While most subunit malaria vaccines provide only limited efficacy,
pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) have
been shown to confer complete sterilizing immunity. We recently generated a
Plasmodium berghei (PbNK65) parasite that lacks a secreted factor, the histamine 
releasing factor (HRF) (PbNK65 hrfΔ), and induces in infected mice a
self-resolving blood stage infection accompanied by a long lasting immunity.
Here, we explore the immunological mechanisms underlying the anti-parasite
protective properties of the mutant PbNK65 hrfΔ and demonstrate that in addition 
to an up-regulation of IL-6 production, CD4+ but not CD8+ T effector lymphocytes 
are indispensable for the clearance of malaria infection. Maintenance of T
cell-associated protection is associated with the reduction in CD4+PD-1+ and
CD8+PD-1+ T cell numbers. A higher number of central and effector memory B cells 
in mutant-infected mice also plays a pivotal role in protection. Importantly, we 
also demonstrate that prior infection with WT parasites followed by a drug cure
does not prevent the induction of PbNK65 hrfΔ-induced protection, suggesting that
such protection in humans may be efficient even in individuals that have been
infected and who repeatedly received antimalarial drugs.
