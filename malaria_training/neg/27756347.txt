BACKGROUND: The geographic scale and degree of genetic differentiation for
arthropod vectors that transmit parasites play an important role in the
distribution, prevalence and coevolution of pathogens of human and wildlife
significance. We determined the genetic diversity and population structure of the
sand fly Lutzomyia vexator over spatial scales from 0.56 to 3.79 km at a study
region in northern California. The study was provoked by observations of
differentiation at fine spatial scales of a lizard malaria parasite vectored by
Lu. vexator.
METHODS: A microsatellite enrichment/next-generation sequencing protocol was used
to identify variable microsatellite loci within the genome of Lu. vexator.
Alleles present at these loci were examined in four populations of Lu. vexator in
Hopland, CA. Population differentiation was assessed using Fst and D (of
Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards), and the program Structure was used to determine the 
degree of subdivision present. The effective population size for the sand fly
populations was also calculated.
RESULTS: Eight microsatellite markers were characterized and revealed high
genetic diversity (uHe = 0.79-0.92, Na = 12-24) and slight but significant
differentiation across the fine spatial scale examined (average pairwise
D = 0.327; F ST  = 0.0185 (95 % bootstrapped CI: 0.0102-0.0264). Even though the 
insects are difficult to capture using standard methods, the estimated population
size was thousands per local site.
CONCLUSIONS: The results argue that Lu. vexator at the study sites are abundant
and not highly mobile, which may influence the overall transmission dynamics of
the lizard malaria parasite, Plasmodium mexicanum, and other parasites
transmitted by this species.
