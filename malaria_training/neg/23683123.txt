In many organisms the Y chromosome initiates sex determination and regulates male
fertility and mating behaviour. However, molecular characterization of Y genes is
rare outside of a few model species because it is difficult to clone and analyse 
repeat-rich heterochromatic Y sequences. In insects, Y genes are only well
characterized in a small number of Drosophila species. Here we report the
discovery of GUY1 (gene unique to the Y), a gene unique to the Y chromosome in
the Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, using an approach that compares 
Illumina sequences separately obtained from male and female genomic DNA.
Experimental evidence confirmed that GUY1 is a single copy gene found only on the
Y chromosome. GUY1 is transcribed at the very onset of zygotic transcription and 
encodes a small lysine-rich protein that forms two alpha helices and shows
DNA-binding properties. Interestingly, three helix-loop-helix proteins are key
factors that determine sex in the early embryo in Drosophila melanogaster. Single
embryo analysis indicated that GUY1 is only transcribed in male embryos and that 
the GUY1 promoter is functional in the early embryos. GUY1 may be used as a
paternally inherited molecular marker. Further investigation of GUY1 will
contribute to the genetic approaches to control mosquito-borne diseases.
