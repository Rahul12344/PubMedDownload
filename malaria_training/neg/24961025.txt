Secondray structure and sequence of ITS2-rDNA of the Egyptian malaria vector
Anopheles pharoensis (Theobald).

Wassim NM.

Out of the twelve Anophelines present in Egypt, only five species known to be
malaria vectors. Anopheles (An.) pharoensis proved to be the important vector all
over Egypt, especially in the Delta. Anopheles sergenti proved to be the primary 
vector in the Oases of the Western Desert, An. multicolor in Faiyoum, An.
stephensi in the Red Sea Coast, and An. superpictus in Sinai. Genomic DNA was
isolated from single adult mosquito of An. pharoensis (Sahel Sudanese form), PCR 
was performed to amplify ITS2 region of rDNA using specific primers for 5.8S and 
28S rDNA genes. The amplicons were purified, directly sequenced and aligned to
the sequence of the same region of An. gambiae, using clustalw2. The length of
ITS2-rDNA of An. pharoensis was 411bp. The GC content of the ITS2 reported 53% is
consistent with spacer base composition in Anopheles species. The similarity
between the two species was 52% and genetic distance was 0.46.Variable simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) are found at low frequency. The secondary structure of
rDNA-ITS2was predicted by MFOLD and was -192; 60 to-195.32 kilocalories/mole.
