Background: Among the severe malaria syndromes, severe malarial anemia (SMA) is
the most common, whereas cerebral malaria (CM) is the most lethal. However, the
mechanisms that lead to CM and SMA are unclear.
Methods: We compared transcriptomic profiles of whole blood obtained from Ugandan
children with acute CM (n = 17) or SMA (n = 17) and community children without
Plasmodium falciparum infection (n = 12) and determined the relationships among
gene expression, hematological indices, and relevant plasma biomarkers.
Results: Both CM and SMA demonstrated predominantly upregulated enrichment of
dendritic cell activation, inflammatory/Toll-like receptor/chemokines, and
monocyte modules, but downregulated enrichment of lymphocyte modules. Nuclear
factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2)-regulated genes were overexpressed in children 
with SMA relative to CM, with the highest expression in children with both SMA
and sickle cell disease (HbSS), corresponding with elevated plasma heme
oxygenase-1 in this group. Erythroid and reticulocyte-specific signatures were
markedly decreased in CM relative to SMA despite higher hemoglobin levels and
appropriate increases in erythropoietin. Viral sensing/interferon-regulatory
factor 2 module expression and plasma interferon-inducible protein-10/CXCL10
negatively correlated with reticulocyte-specific signatures.
Conclusions: Compared with SMA, CM is associated with downregulation of
Nrf2-related and erythropoiesis signatures by whole-blood transcriptomics. Future
studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess pathways that may be
amenable to interventions to ameliorate CM and SMA.
