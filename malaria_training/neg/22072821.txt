Rodent malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium berghei, are practical and useful
model organisms for human malaria research because of their analogies to the
human malaria in terms of structure, physiology, and life cycle. Exploiting the
available genetic sequence information, we constructed a cDNA library from the
erythrocytic stages of P. berghei and analyzed the expressed sequence tag (EST). 
A total of 10,040 ESTs were generated and assembled into 2,462 clusters. These
EST clusters were compared against public protein databases and 48 putative new
transcripts, most of which were hypothetical proteins with unknown function, were
identified. Genes encoding ribosomal or membrane proteins and purine nucleotide
phosphorylases were highly abundant clusters in P. berghei. Protein domain
analyses and the Gene Ontology functional categorization revealed
translation/protein folding, metabolism, protein degradation, and multiple family
of variant antigens to be mainly prevalent. The presently-collected ESTs and its 
bioinformatic analysis will be useful resources to identify for drug target and
vaccine candidates and validate gene predictions of P. berghei.
