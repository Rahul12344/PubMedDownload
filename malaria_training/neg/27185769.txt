A nanoparticle-based assay for detection and quantification of Plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in urine and serum is reported. The
assay uses magnetic beads conjugated with anti-HRP2 antibody for protein capture 
and concentration, and antibody-conjugated quantum dots for optical detection.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that magnetic beads allow the concentration of
HRP2 protein in urine by 20-fold. The concentration effect was achieved because
large volume of urine can be incubated with beads, and magnetic separation can be
easily performed in minutes to isolate beads containing HRP2 protein. Magnetic
beads and quantum dots conjugated to anti-HRP2 antibodies allows the detection of
low concentrations of HRP2 protein (0.5 ng/mL), and quantification in the range
of 33-2,000 ng/mL corresponding to the range associated with non-severe to severe
malaria. This assay can be easily adapted to a noninvasive point-of-care test for
classification of severe malaria.
