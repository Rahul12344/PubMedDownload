BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is considered second only to malaria as the most
devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries. Schistosome cercariae invade
the host by penetrating the skin and migrate though the lungs and portal
circulation to their final destination in the hepatic portal system and
eventually the mesenteric veins. Previous studies have shown that the cytotoxic
pathways that target schistosomulum in the lung-stage involve nitric oxide (NO)
produced by macrophages. By contrast, skin-stage schistosomulas can evade
clearance, indicating that they might be freed from macrophage NO-mediated
cytotoxicity to achieve immune evasion; however, the critical molecules and
mechanisms involved remain unknown.
METHODS: Recombinant SjCa8 (rSjCa8), an 8-kDa calcium-binding protein that is
stage-specifically expressed in cercaria and early skin-stage schistosomulas of
Schistosoma japonicum, was incubated with mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Effects on 
macrophage proliferation were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8. Next,
transwell assay was carried out to further investigate the role of rSjCa8 in
macrophage migration. The effects of rSjCa8 on macrophage apoptosis were
evaluated using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Additional impacts of
rSjCa8 on NO release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages as well
as the underlying mechanisms were explored using fluorescent probe, nitric oxide 
signaling pathway microarray, quantitative real-time PCR, mutagenesis, and
neutralizing antibody approaches.
RESULTS: rSjCa8 exhibited a striking inhibitory effect on macrophage migration,
but did not markedly increase cell proliferation or apoptosis. Additionally,
rSjCa8 potently inhibited NO release by LPS-stimulated macrophages in a dose- and
time-dependent manner, and the inhibitory mechanism was closely associated with
intracellular Ca(2+) levels, the up-regulation of catalase expression, and the
down-regulation of the expression of 47 genes, including Myc, Gadd45a, Txnip,
Fas, Sod2, Nos2, and Hmgb1. Vaccination with rSjCa8 increased NO concentration in
the challenging skin area of infected mice and reduced the number of migrated
schistosomula after skin penetration by cercariae.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that SjCa8 might be a novel molecule that
plays a critical role in immune evasion by S. japonicum cercaria during the
process of skin penetration. The inhibitory impacts of rSjCa8 on macrophage
migration and [Ca(2+)]i-dependent NO release suggest it might represent a novel
vaccine candidate and chemotherapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of
schistosomiasis.
