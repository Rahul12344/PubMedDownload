cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) exhibit diverse physiological functions in
the mammalian system e.g., in vascular and gastrointestinal smooth muscles, in
platelets, in kidney, in bone growth, nociception and in the central nervous
system. Furthermore, PKG were found in insects and in the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. Two different genes of PKG exist: a) the PKG-I gene that
is expressed as cytosolic PKG-Iα or PKG-Iβ isoform, and b) the PKG-II gene, which
expresses the membrane associated PKG-II protein. The enzyme kinetics, the
localization and the substrates of these PKG enzymes differ utilizing different
physiological functions. Various inhibitors of PKG were developed directed
against diverse functional regions of the kinase. These inhibitors of PKG have
been used to analyse the specific functions of these enzymes. The review article 
will summarize these different inhibitors regarding their specificity and their
present applications in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it will be discussed that
the distinct inhibition of the PKG enzymes could be used as a valuable
pharmacological target e.g., in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases,
diarrhea, cancer or malaria.
