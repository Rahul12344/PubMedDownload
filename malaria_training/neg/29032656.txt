The barn owl (BO) and the collared scops owl (CSO) are common nocturnal raptors
throughout Thailand. Blood samples from 23 adult BOs and 14 CSOs were collected
and processed for complete blood cell counts and parasite morphological
examinations. Two Haemoproteus-positive samples were processed for
ultrastructural observation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for a
partial cytochrome b gene (cytb) from Haemoproteus was performed in all samples. 
Haemoproteus presence detected by light microscopy was lower than that detected
by PCR (30.4% and 34.8%, respectively, in BO; and 50.0% and 78.6%, respectively, 
in CSO). Comparative hematology revealed that Haemoproteus-positive BOs had
higher mean cell hemoglobin concentration, total leukocyte, absolute heterophil, 
basophil, and monocyte counts than Haemoproteus-negative BOs, but no significant 
differences between Haemoproteus-negative and -positive CSOs. Monocyte
ultrastructure analysis revealed a role in the elimination of gametocytes.
Morphologically, the Haemoproteus in 3 BOs and 6 CSOs were identified as H.
noctuae, while that in 1 CSO was identified as H. syrnii. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated the Haemoproteus spp. in 8 BOs and 7 CSOs were not closely related to
H. noctuae or H. syrnii, and the cytb of 2 CSOs was that of H. syrnii. These
results should be useful for study of Haemoproteus.
