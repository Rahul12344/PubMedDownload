BACKGROUND: The sterile insect technique and transgenic equivalents are
considered promising tools for controlling vector-borne disease in an age of
increasing insecticide and drug-resistance. Combining vector interventions with
artemisinin-based therapies may achieve the twin goals of suppressing malaria
endemicity while managing artemisinin resistance. While the cost-effectiveness of
these controls has been investigated independently, their combined usage has not 
been dynamically optimized in response to ecological and epidemiological
processes.
RESULTS: An optimal control framework based on coupled models of mosquito
population dynamics and malaria epidemiology is used to investigate the
cost-effectiveness of combining vector control with drug therapies in homogeneous
environments with and without vector migration. The costs of endemic malaria are 
weighed against the costs of administering artemisinin therapies and releasing
modified mosquitoes using various cost structures. Larval density dependence is
shown to reduce the cost-effectiveness of conventional sterile insect releases
compared with transgenic mosquitoes with a late-acting lethal gene. Using drug
treatments can reduce the critical vector control release ratio necessary to
cause disease fadeout.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining vector control and drug therapies is the most effective
and efficient use of resources, and using optimized implementation strategies can
substantially reduce costs.
