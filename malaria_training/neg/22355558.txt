Blood stage malaria parasites causing a mild and self limited infection in mice
have been obtained with either radiation or chemical mutagenesis showing the
possibility of developing an attenuated malaria vaccine. Targeted disruption of
plasmepsin-4 (pm4) or the merozoite surface protein-7 (msp7) genes also induces a
virulence-attenuated phenotype in terms of absence of experimental cerebral
malaria (ECM), delayed increase of parasitemia and reduced mortality rate. The
decrease in virulence in parasites lacking either pm4 or msp7 is however
incomplete and dependent on the parasite and mouse strain combination. The
sequential disruption of both genes induced remarkable virulence-attenuated
blood-stage parasites characterized by a self-resolving infection with low levels
of parasitemia and no ECM. Furthermore, convalescent mice were protected against 
the challenge with P. berghei or P. yoelii parasites for several months. These
observations provide a proof-of-concept step for the development of human malaria
vaccines based on genetically attenuated blood-stage parasites.
