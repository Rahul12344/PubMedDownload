With a renewed hope for malaria elimination, interventions that prevent
transmission of parasites from humans to mosquitoes have received elevated
attention. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) targeting the sexual stages are 
well suited for this task. Here, through bioinformatic analysis, we selected two 
putative Plasmodium berghei ookinete-stage proteins (PBANKA_111920, and
PBANKA_145770) and a previously characterized ookinete protein PBANKA_135340
(PSOP7) for evaluation of their transmission-blocking potentials. Fragments of
these predicted proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified recombinant
proteins were used to immunize mice. Antisera against these recombinant proteins 
recognized proteins of predicted sizes from ookinete lysates and localized their 
expression on the surface of ookinetes. Inclusion of these antisera in in vitro
ookinete culture significantly inhibited ookinete formation. Mosquitoes fed on
mice immunized with the recombinant proteins also showed significantly reduced
oocyst densities (60.0-70.7%) and modest reductions of oocyst prevalence
(10.7-37.4%). These data, together with the conservation of these genes in
Plasmodium, suggest that these three ookinete proteins could be new promising
targets for TBVs and are worth of future investigations in the human malaria
parasites.
