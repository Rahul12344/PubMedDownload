BACKGROUND: Gene drive mosquitoes have been proposed as a possible means to
reduce the transmission of malaria in Africa. Because this technology has no
prior use-history at this time, environmental risk assessments for gene drive
mosquitoes will benefit from problem formulation-an organized and ordered process
to identify protection goals and potential pathways to harm to the environment,
or animal or human health. Recognizing this need, the New Partnership for
Africa's Development (NEPAD), with support from African and international
partners, organized four regional consultative workshops in Africa to initiate
this process.
METHODS: The workshops were attended by a diverse set of participants and
stakeholders, including scientists, ethicists, health professionals, government
regulators in the fields of environment health and biosafety as well government
policymakers, who met for 4Â days to deliberate on protection goals and pathways
relevant to the use of gene drive mosquitoes for malaria control. The goal of the
workshops was not to produce a comprehensive and detailed environmental risk
assessment of gene drive mosquitoes, but rather to introduce problem formulation 
as a tool to the stakeholder community, and to serve as a starting point for
conducting systematic environmental risk assessments in the future, identifying
protection goals related to gene drive mosquitoes that are particular to African 
stakeholders.
RESULTS: Participants in the workshops frequently identified human health and
biodiversity as being relevant broad protection goals. Results of the
deliberations provide insight into the concerns of African participants at an
early stage in the development of gene drive organism/products that should be
instructive to developers using this technology.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, the African participants of the consultations had a
precautionary perspective with regard to environmental risk assessment of gene
drive technology. As gene drive technology develops, protection goals will become
further refined and candidate products will be further defined. These workshops
represent only the beginning of a continuing process that will ultimately inform 
environmental risk assessment for gene drive mosquitoes to control malaria in
Africa.
