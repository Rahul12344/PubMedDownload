BACKGROUND: In 2017, nearly 80% of malaria morbidity and mortality occurred in
sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and India. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs),
especially those targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) of Plasmodium
falciparum, have become an important diagnostic tool in these malaria-endemic
areas. However, the chances of RDT-oriented successful treatment are increasingly
jeopardized by the appearance of mutants with deletions in pfhrp2 and pfhrp3
genes. This systematic review and meta-analysis determines the prevalence of
field P. falciparum isolates with deletion in pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes and
their proportion among false-negative results in the PfHRP2-based RDTs in SSA and
India.
METHODS: Eight electronic databases were used for searching potentially relevant 
publications for the systematic review analysis, wherein the main methodological 
aspects of included studies were analysed and some missing links in the included 
studies were identified.
RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included, 16 from SSA and 3 from India. The
pooled prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions was 8 and 5% while 16 and 4% for pfhrp3
gene deletions in Africa and India, respectively. The pooled proportion of pfhrp2
gene deletions found among false negative PfHRP2-based RDTs results was about
27.0 and 69.0% in Africa and India, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This review study indicates a relatively high proportion of both
pfhrp2/3 genes deletions in P. falciparum isolates and among false-negative
malaria cases using PfHRP2-based RDT results in SSA and India. Recently the
deletions in pfhrp2/3 genes have also been reported from two African countries
(Nigeria and Sudan). This review emphasizes the importance of more extensive
studies and standardization of studies addressing the pfhrp2/3 gene deletions in 
malarious areas.
