Understanding the genetic diversity, extent and distribution of variant forms of 
Plasmodium vivax parasites is crucial in the development of effective control
measures and in Orissa, a hyperendemic state in the eastern part of India, the
polymorphic nature of P. vivax isolates is largely lacking. The result of the
study analyzing two highly polymorphic single copy genes for P. vivax
circumsporozoite protein (pvcs) and P. vivax merozoite surface protein 3α
(pvmsp3α) shows that the parasite population is highly heterogenous (33 distinct 
genotype from 35 isolates) in Orissa. However, the observation of the
multiplicity of infection value of 1.34 and high frequency distribution of
certain genotype with respect to individual marker (the VK247b allele with a
frequency of 0.37; VK210e with 0.25 and VK210c with 0.14) suggests that the
parasite population are likely to be under selective pressure and may either be
due to preferential production of sporozoites carrying these variants in the
available anopheline mosquito species of the state or selection of particular
genotypes by host immune pressure. Moreover, although P. vivax in South-East Asia
indicates an overall predominance of VK210 which is thought to be the best
adapted variant of pvcs repeat type, the almost equal prevalence of both repeat
type of pvcs; VK210 and VK247 in the present study is unexpected and needs
further study for clarification.
