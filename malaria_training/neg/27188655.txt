BACKGROUND: Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is a neglected disease that has
been restricted to East Africa for many decades. Several cases in refugees from
the Horn of Africa have been recently diagnosed in four European countries.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report four additional cases of LBRF in asylum seekers from
Somalia and Eritrea who presented with fever shortly after arriving in
Switzerland during a seven-month period. Multiple spirochetes were visualized on 
stained blood films which were identified as Borrelia recurrentis by 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. All patients recovered after antibiotic treatment with
ceftriaxone and/or doxycycline. Concurrent infections (malaria and tuberculosis) 
were diagnosed in half of our patients. Possible modes of transmission and
preventive measures are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: These reported cases highlight the ongoing transmission of LBRF in
migrants from East Africa. Diagnosis of LBRF cases and prevention of
autochthonous transmission in asylum seeker camps are important steps for the
near future.
