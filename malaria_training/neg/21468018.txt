Blood group variants are characteristic of population groups, and can show
conspicuous geographic patterns. Interest in the global prevalence of the Duffy
blood group variants is multidisciplinary, but of particular importance to
malariologists due to the resistance generally conferred by the Duffy-negative
phenotype against Plasmodium vivax infection. Here we collate an extensive
geo-database of surveys, forming the evidence-base for a multi-locus Bayesian
geostatistical model to generate global frequency maps of the common Duffy
alleles to refine the global cartography of the common Duffy variants. We show
that the most prevalent allele globally was FY*A, while across sub-Saharan Africa
the predominant allele was the silent FY*B(ES) variant, commonly reaching
fixation across stretches of the continent. The maps presented not only represent
the first spatially and genetically comprehensive description of variation at
this locus, but also constitute an advance towards understanding the transmission
patterns of the neglected P. vivax malaria parasite.
