OBJECTIVE: To clone a Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein critical functional 
region II (PvDBPII) gene of central China isolate, and to express and identify
the recombinant PvDBPII protein in vitro.
METHODS: PCR was performed to amplify PvDBPII from P. vivax DNA of a central
China isolate and the PCR product was inserted into pET28a(+) vector.
pET28a-PvDBPII recombinant plasmid was constructed and transformed into E. coli
host BL21 (DE3+). IPTG was used to induce the recombinant PvDBPII protein fused
with His tag, and the protein was purified by His-NTA affinity chromatography.
The recombinant protein was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
RESULTS: The PCR product of PvDBPII gene was about 1,1 kb, meeting the
expectation of predicted fragment size. The recombinant pET28a-PvDBPII plasmid
was verified by sequencing that the insertion was correct both in direction and
in frame, but with 4 non-synonymous mutations compared to reference P. vivax
strain Sal-I. SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant
PvDBPII protein was about 44 kDa, and could be recognized by pooled sera from
vivax malaria patients.
CONCLUSION: The PvDBPII gene of central China isolate is successfully cloned, and
recombinant PvDBPII is expressed, thereby providing opportunity for further study
on PvDBPII.
