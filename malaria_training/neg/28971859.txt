Antimalarial interventions have yielded a significant decline in malaria
prevalence in The Gambia, where artemether-lumefantrine (AL) has been used as a
first-line antimalarial for a decade. Clinical Plasmodium falciparum isolates
collected from 2012 to 2015 were analyzed ex vivo for antimalarial susceptibility
and genotyped for drug resistance markers (pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 codons 86, 184, and
1246, and pfk13) and microsatellite variation. Additionally, allele frequencies
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from other drug resistance-associated
genes were compared from genomic sequence data sets from 2008 (n = 79) and 2014
(n = 168). No artemisinin resistance-associated pfk13 mutation was found, and
only 4% of the isolates tested in 2015 showed significant growth after exposure
to dihydroartemisinin. Conversely, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of
amodiaquine and lumefantrine increased within this period. pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1
184F mutants remained at a prevalence above 80%. pfcrt 76T was positively
associated with higher IC50s to chloroquine. pfmdr1 NYD increased in frequency
between 2012 and 2015 due to lumefantrine selection. The TNYD (pfcrt 76T and
pfmdr1 NYD wild-type haplotype) also increased in frequency following AL
implementation in 2008. These results suggest selection for pfcrt and pfmdr1
genotypes that enable tolerance to lumefantrine. Increased tolerance to
lumefantrine calls for sustained chemotherapeutic monitoring in The Gambia to
minimize complete artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) failure in the future.
