Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species are unicellular, eukaryotic pathogens that
have evolved the capacity to survive and proliferate within a human host, causing
sleeping sickness and malaria, respectively. They have very different survival
strategies. African trypanosomes divide in blood and extracellular spaces,
whereas Plasmodium species invade and proliferate within host cells. Interaction 
with host macromolecules is central to establishment and maintenance of an
infection by both parasites. Proteins that mediate these interactions are under
selection pressure to bind host ligands without compromising immune avoidance
strategies. In both parasites, the expansion of genes encoding a small number of 
protein folds has established large protein families. This has permitted both
diversification to form novel ligand binding sites and variation in sequence that
contributes to avoidance of immune recognition. In this review we consider two
such parasite surface protein families, one from each species. In each case,
known structures demonstrate how extensive sequence variation around a conserved 
molecular architecture provides an adaptable protein scaffold that the parasites 
can mobilise to mediate interactions with their hosts.
