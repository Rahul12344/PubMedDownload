In humans, cerebral malaria is a rare but often lethal complication of infection 
with Plasmodium parasites, the occurrence of which is influenced by complex
genetic factors of the host. We used a mouse model of experimental cerebral
malaria (ECM) with Plasmodium berghei ANKA to study genetic factors regulating
appearance of neurological symptoms and associated lethality. In a genome-wide
screen of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and
129S1/SvImJ (129) mouse strains, we detected a strong interaction between the
genetic backgrounds of these strains, which modulates ECM resistance. We have
mapped a major gene locus to central chromosome 4 (log of the odds (LOD) 6.7;
79.6-97.3 Mb), which we designate Berr8. [corrected]. B6 alleles at Berr6 are
associated with resistance, and are inherited in a co-dominant fashion. In mice
heterozygous for Berr6 B6/129 alleles, resistance to ECM is strongly modulated by
a second locus, Berr7, that maps to the proximal portion of chromosome 1 (LOD
4.03; 41.4 Mb). 129 alleles at Berr7 are associated with ECM resistance in a
dosage-dependent fashion. Results are discussed in view of the possible role of
this two-locus system in susceptibility to unrelated inflammatory conditions in
mice and humans.
