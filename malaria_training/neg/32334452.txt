OBJECTIVE: To investigate cytotoxic activity of ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate (EPMC)
including its effect on p-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance-1: mdr-1 gene) in
human cholangiocarcinoma cell.
METHODS: Cytotoxic activity of EPMC against human cholangiocarcinoma (CL-6),
fibroblast (OUMS-36T-1F), and colon cancer (Caco-2) cell lines were assessed
using MTT assay. Selectivity index (SI) was determined as the ratio of IC50
(concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%) of EPMC in OUMS-36T-1F and that 
in CL-6 cell. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CL-6 cells were investigated by 
flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Effect of EPMC on mdr-1 gene
expression in CL-6 and Caco-2 was determined by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The median (95% CI) IC50 values of EPMC in CL-6, OUMS-36T-1F, and Caco-2
were 245.5 (243.1-266.7), 899.60 (855.8-966.3) and 347.0 (340.3-356.9) Âµg/ml,
respectively. The SI value of the compound for the CL-6 cell was 3.70. EPMC at
IC50 inhibited CL-6 cell division and induced apoptosis compared to untreated
control. EPMC exposure did not induce mdr-1 gene expression in both CL-6 and
Caco-2 cells.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest the potential role of EPMC in cholangiocarcinoma 
with a low possibility of drug resistance induction.
