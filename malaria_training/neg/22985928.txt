Fusidic acid known to has antibacterial, antifungal, and antimalarial activities.
Fusidic acid blocks translation elongation factor G gene in Plasmodium
falciparum. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of fusidic acid on the
in vitro growth of bovine and equine Babesia parasites were evaluated. The
inhibitory effect of fusidic acid on the in vivo growth of Babesia microti was
also assessed. The in vitro growth of four Babesia species that were tested was
significantly inhibited (P<0.05) by micromolar concentrations of fusidic acid
(IC(50) values=144.8, 17.3, 33.3, and 56.25 μM for Babesia bovis, Babesia
bigemina, Babesia caballi, and Theileria equi, respectively). Combinations of
fusidic acid with diminazene aceturate synergistically potentiated its inhibitory
effects in vitro on B. bovis and B. caballi. In B. microti-infected mice, fusidic
acid caused significant (P<0.05) inhibition of the growth of B. microti at the
dose of 500 mg/kg BW relative to control group. These results indicate that
fusidic acid might be incorporated in treatment of babesiosis.
