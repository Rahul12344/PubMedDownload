Differential expression of ligands in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum enables it to recognize different receptors on the erythrocyte
surface, thereby providing alternative invasion pathways. Switching of invasion
from using sialated to nonsialated erythrocyte receptors has been linked to the
transcriptional activation of a single parasite ligand. We have used quantitative
proteomics to show that in addition to this single known change, there are a
significant number of changes in the expression of merozoite proteins that are
regulated independent of transcription during invasion pathway switching. These
results demonstrate a so far unrecognized mechanism by which the malaria parasite
is able to adapt to variations in the host cell environment by
post-transcriptional regulation.
