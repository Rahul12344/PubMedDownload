Recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages are essential for
clearance of malaria infection, but these have also been associated with adverse 
clinical outcomes. In this review we discuss recent discoveries on how distinct
molecular interactions between monocytes, macrophages, and malaria parasites may 
alter the balance between protection and pathology in malaria-infected
individuals. The immunopathology of severe malaria often originates from
excessive immune activation by parasites. The involvement of monocytes and
macrophages in these events is highlighted, and priorities for future research to
clarify the roles of these cells in malaria are proposed. Knowledge of the
factors influencing the balance between protection and pathology can assist in
the design of therapeutics aimed at modulating monocyte and macrophage functions 
to improve outcomes.
