Antibodies play major roles in immunity to malaria; however, a limited
understanding of mechanisms mediating protection is a major barrier to vaccine
development. We have demonstrated that acquired human anti-malarial antibodies
promote complement deposition on the merozoite to mediate inhibition of
erythrocyte invasion through C1q fixation and activation of the classical
complement pathway. Antibody-mediated complement-dependent (Ab-C') inhibition was
the predominant invasion-inhibitory activity of human antibodies; most antibodies
were non-inhibitory without complement. Inhibitory activity was mediated
predominately via C1q fixation, and merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were
identified as major targets. Complement fixation by antibodies was very strongly 
associated with protection from both clinical malaria and high-density
parasitemia in a prospective longitudinal study of children. Ab-C' inhibitory
activity could be induced by human immunization with a candidate merozoite
surface-protein vaccine. Our findings demonstrate that human anti-malarial
antibodies have evolved to function by fixing complement for potent
invasion-inhibitory activity and protective immunity.
