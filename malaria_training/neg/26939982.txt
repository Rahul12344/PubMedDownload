Thelohanellus macrovacuolaris n. sp. is described during a survey on myxozoan
diversity of common carp Cyprinus carpio L. in China. It is characterized by the 
presence of round or ellipsoidal plasmodium in the palate in the mouth of host.
Mature spores were pyriform in frontal view, lemon shaped in lateral view,
measuring 21.6±0.9 (19.3-23.8) long, 12.5±0.7 (10.3-13.6) wide, and 10.2±0.4
(9.8-11.8) thick. Most spores were surrounded by the membrane sheath. Single
polar capsule was round with an apophysis at its top end presented close to apex 
of spore, measuring 9.1±0.6 (8.0-10.0) in length, 8.6±0.5 (7.8-9.6) in width.
Polar filaments coiled, with 7 to 8 turns. A large, round iodinophilous vacuole
was present, with 5.8-7.5 in diameter. The present species is morphologically
distinct from all other Thelohanellus species. The BLAST search indicated that
the newly obtained small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene sequence of T.
macrovacuolaris n. sp. did not match any available sequences in GenBank.
Phylogenetically, T. macrovacuolaris n. sp. was placed sister to Thelohanellus
wangi in the Thelohanellus clade. Both morphology and ssrRNA gene sequence data
revealed that the present parasite is a new species of genus Thelohanellus.
