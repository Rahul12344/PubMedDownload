Microbial infections in the mosquito Aedes aegypti activate the newly identified 
CLSP1 and CLSP2 genes, which encode modular proteins composed of elastase-like
serine protease and C-type lectin domains. These genes are predominantly
regulated by the immune deficiency pathway, but also by the Toll pathway.
Silencing of CLSP2, but not CLSP1, results in the activation of prophenoloxidase 
(PPO), the terminal enzyme in the melanization cascade, suggesting that CLSP2 is 
a negative modulator of this reaction. Haemolymph PPO activation is normally
inhibited in the presence of Plasmodium parasites, but in CLSP2-depleted
mosquitoes, the Plasmodium-induced block of melanization is reverted, and these
mosquitoes are refractory to the parasite. Thus, CLSP2 is a new component of the 
mosquito immune response.
