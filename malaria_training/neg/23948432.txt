Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum genes Pfdhfr and Pfdhps have rendered
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) ineffective for malaria treatment in most regions 
of the world. Yet, SP is efficacious as intermittent preventive therapy in
pregnant women (IPTp) and infants (IPTi) and as seasonal malaria control in
children (SMC). SP-IPTp is being widely implemented in sub-Saharan Africa.
SP-IPTi is recommended where the prevalence of SP-resistant malaria parasites is 
low, whereas SMC is recommended for areas of intense seasonal malaria
transmission. The continuing success of these interventions depends largely on
the prevalence of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps resistance mutations in the target
population. Here we review the relationship between resistance mutations and
SP-IPT within target populations in the context of monitoring and informing
implementation of this intervention.
