We describe a technology for imaging the sequestration of infected red blood
cells (iRBC) of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei both in the bodies
of live mice and in dissected organs, using a transgenic parasite that expresses 
luciferase. Real-time imaging of sequestered iRBC is performed by measuring
bioluminescence produced by the enzymatic reaction in parasites between the
luciferase enzyme and its substrate luciferin injected into the mice several
minutes prior to imaging. The bioluminescence signal is detected by a sensitive
I-CCD photon-counting video camera. Using a reporter parasite that expresses
luciferase under the control of a schizont-specific promoter (i.e., the ama-1
promoter), the schizont stage is made visible when detecting bioluminescence
signals. Schizont sequestration is imaged during short-term infections with
parasites that are synchronized in development or during ongoing infections.
Real-time in vivo imaging of iRBC will provide increased insights into the
dynamics of sequestration and its role in pathology, and can be used to evaluate 
strategies that prevent sequestration.
