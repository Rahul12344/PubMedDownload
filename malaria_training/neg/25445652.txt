Pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IFNα function through their cellular
receptors IFNγR1 and IFNαR1, respectively to mediate immune processes during
malaria infection. A total of 21 SNPs, 2 ins/del polymorphisms and a
microsatellite repeat, selected on the basis of their reported association with
infectious diseases including malaria in world populations, were analysed for
association with Plasmodium falciparum malaria susceptibility in a case-control
study with adult patients and ethnically-matched controls drawn from a disease
meso- to hyperendemic and a nonendemic region of India. Among the five IFNG SNPs 
tested, an intron 3 and a 3'UTR SNP associated with disease in the endemic
region. In addition, large (CA)n repeats of IFNG intron 1 associated with
protection from severe malaria in the endemic region (severe vs. control, odds
ratio=0.21, 95% CI=0.08-0.52, P=1.3 × 10(-4)). The TA11CAG haplotype (rs2069705
T/C, rs2430561 A/T, rs3138557 (CA)n, rs2069718 T/C, rs2069727 A/G, rs2069728 G/A)
carrying a short CA11 repeat also exhibited very strong association with severe
malaria, particularly in the endemic region (severe vs. control, OR=14.56, 95%
CI=3.39-85.81, P=3 × 10(-5)). One SNP each from the IFNA8 and IFNA17 of IFNA gene
cluster had a protective effect in the non-endemic region but not in the endemic 
region. A promoter and an intron 2 SNP of IFNAR1 were risk factors for disease
and the IFNAR1 haplotype GCCAGG (rs2843710 C/G, rs2850015 C/T, +6993 C/T,
rs2243594 A/G, rs1012335 G/C, rs2257167 G/C) carrying both the risk alleles
strikingly associated with disease manifestation in the endemic region (severe
vs. control, OR=27.14, 95% CI=3.12-1254, P=2 × 10(-5); non-severe vs. control,
OR=61.87, 95% CI=10.08-2521, P=1 × 10(-8)). The data indicates dissimilar
contribution of cytokine and cytokine receptor variants to disease in populations
residing in areas of differential malaria endemicity.
