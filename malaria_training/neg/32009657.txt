IR-TEx is an application written in Shiny (an R package) that allows exploration 
of the expression of (as well as assigning functions to) transcripts whose
expression is associated with insecticide resistance phenotypes in Anopheles
gambiae mosquitoes. The application can be used online or downloaded and used
locally by anyone. The local application can be modified to add new insecticide
resistance datasets generated from multiple -omics platforms. This guide
demonstrates how to add new datasets and handle missing data. Furthermore, IR-TEx
can be completely and easily recoded to use-omics datasets from any experimental 
data, making it a valuable resource to many researchers. The protocol illustrates
the utility of IR-TEx in identifying new insecticide resistance candidates using 
the the microsomal glutathione transferase, GSTMS1, as an example. This
transcript is upregulated in multiple pyrethroid resistant populations from CÃ´te 
D'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. The identification of co-correlated transcripts
provides further insight into the putative roles of this gene.
