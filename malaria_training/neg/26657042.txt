Retinopathy provides a window into the underlying pathology of life-threatening
malarial coma ("cerebral malaria"), allowing differentiation between 1) coma
caused by sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the
brain and 2) coma with other underlying causes. Parasite sequestration in the
brain is mediated by PfEMP1; a diverse parasite antigen that is inserted into the
surface of infected erythrocytes and adheres to various host receptors. PfEMP1
sub-groups called "DC8" and "DC13" have been proposed to cause brain pathology
through interactions with endothelial protein C receptor. To test this we
profiled PfEMP1 gene expression in parasites from children with clinically
defined cerebral malaria, who either had or did not have accompanying
retinopathy. We found no evidence for an elevation of DC8 or DC13 PfEMP1
expression in children with retinopathy. However, the proportional expression of 
a broad subgroup of PfEMP1 called "group A" was elevated in retinopathy patients 
suggesting that these variants may play a role in the pathology of cerebral
malaria. Interventions targeting group A PfEMP1 may be effective at reducing
brain pathology.
