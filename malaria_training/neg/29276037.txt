Malaria is a devastating disease in sub-Saharan Africa and is transmitted by the 
mosquito Anopheles gambiae. While indoor residual spraying of anticholinesterase 
insecticides has been useful in controlling the spread of malaria, widespread
application of these compounds has led to the rise of an insecticide-resistant
mosquito strain that harbors a G119S mutation in the nervous system target enzyme
acetylcholinesterase. We demonstrate the atomic basis of insecticide resistance
through structure determination of the G119S mutant acetylcholinesterase of An.
gambiae in the ligand-free state and bound to a potent difluoromethyl ketone
inhibitor. These structures reveal specific features within the active-site gorge
distinct from human acetylcholinesterase, including an open channel at the base
of the gorge, and provide a means for improving species selectivity in the
rational design of improved insecticides for malaria vector control.
