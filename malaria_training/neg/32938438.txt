BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum parasites are known to exhibit extensive
genetic diversity in areas of high transmission intensity and infected
individuals in such communities often harbour several complex mixtures of
parasite clones with different genetic characteristics. However, in the
micro-environment, the extent of genetic diversity of P. falciparum parasites
remain largely unknown. In this study therefore, the complexity of P. falciparum 
infections in households was investigated among symptomatic siblings, living
under the same roof in north-central Nigeria.
METHODS: Children were enrolled into the study if they were at least two from a
household and presented with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria. Clinical malaria 
was confirmed by light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films.
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood spots on filter paper. Molecular
characterization of P. falciparum isolates was done by allele-specific nested PCR
of the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein-2 (msp-2) gene.
RESULTS: Ninety-three children from 43 households were enrolled into this study. 
A total of 26 different msp-2 alleles were identified from 215 fragments (range: 
180-480 bp). Majority of the isolates [65.6% (n = 61)] were polyclonal infections
consisting of 2-6 clones and were significantly more common with the FC27 allelic
family (p = 0.036). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) per household ranged from
1.0 to 4.5 while the overall MOI in the study population was 2.31. The pattern of
distribution of msp-2 allele types among the households fell into two categories:
households where both msp-2 allele types (FC27 and 3D7) were present; households 
where only one msp-2 allele type (FC27 or 3D7) was present. Majority of the
households [88.4% (n = 38)], had both msp-2 allele types but they were
disproportionately distributed among the children while in a few households
[11.6% (n = 5)], all the children were infected with only one type of msp-2
allele.
CONCLUSION: These findings showed that P. falciparum isolates exhibit remarkable 
degree of genetic diversity in the micro-environment and are composed mainly of
multiclonal infections, which is an indication of a high ongoing parasite
transmission. This suggests that the micro-environment is an important area of
focus for malaria control interventions and for evaluating intervention
programmes.
