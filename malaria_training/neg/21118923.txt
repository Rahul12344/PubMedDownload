Antifolate resistance in Plasmodium vivax is caused by point mutations in genes
encoding dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps). 
In this study, we used direct sequencing to survey pvdhfr and pvdhps mutations in
122 clinical P. vivax isolates from a central and a southern province of China.
For pvdhfr, 36.9% were wild-type, whereas mutations were detected at four codons 
(57, 58, 61, and 117). The S117N/T mutation was the most prevalent (48.4%),
followed by the T61M mutation (18.9%). Six pvdhfr mutant alleles were found,
ranging from 37.7% to 0.8%. The dramatically different pvdhfr allele frequencies 
between the two P. vivax populations might be caused by different drug histories 
or intrinsic difference between temperate and subtropical strains. In contrast,
except polymorphisms within a repeat region, no resistance-conferring mutations
were detected in pvdhps. Our result suggests that P. vivax populations in China
may be relatively susceptible to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
