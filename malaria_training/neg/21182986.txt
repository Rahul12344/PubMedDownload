The merozoite surface protein (MSP) family is involved in the initial interaction
between merozoites and erythrocytes in Plasmodium species, its members are
therefore becoming major targets for vaccine development. Considering that
antigens included in a subunit malaria vaccine should be both accessible to the
immune system and lack genetic diversity or have very limited polymorphism, we
have analyzed the genetic diversity of three msp genes (msp-7A, msp-7K and
msp-10) in different geographical regions of Colombia. The results showed that
these genes follow the neutral model of evolution and also display low genetic
diversity. The strong conservation found for msp-7 haplotypes in isolates from
geographically different regions further suggests that these proteins could be
good components of a vaccine against Plasmodium vivax malaria, thereby avoiding
strain-specific immune responses.
