Severe malaria is caused by the Apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and 
results in significant global morbidity and mortality, particularly among young
children and pregnant women. P. falciparum exclusively infects human erythrocytes
during clinical illness, and several natural erythrocyte polymorphisms are
protective against severe malaria. Since erythrocytes are enucleated and lack
DNA, genetic approaches to understand erythrocyte determinants of malaria
infection have historically been limited. This review highlights recent advances 
in the use of hematopoietic stem cells to facilitate genetic screening for
malaria host factors. While challenges still exist, this approach holds promise
for gaining new insights into host-pathogen interactions in malaria.
