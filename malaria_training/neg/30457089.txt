Self-medication with antimalarial drugs is a major factor in the development of
drug resistance, exerting subtherapeutic drug pressure on circulating parasite
populations. Data on self-medication with antimalarials from the Southern Pacific
coast region of Colombia, where 4-aminoquinolines resistance and political
instability prevail, are vital to elimination strategies. We present results of
an exploratory study of 254 individuals having malaria symptoms who sought
malaria diagnosis in two hospitals in Tumaco, Department of Nariño, Colombia.
Thirty-two percent (82/254) of participants had positive Saker-Solomons urine
tests, indicating self-medication with chloroquine (CQ) before consultation for
diagnosis. Notably, among 30 pregnant women participating in the study, 43% were 
Saker--Solomons positive. Molecular analysis of the K76T position encoded by the 
pfcrt gene revealed the mutant allele in all four samples that were both positive
for Plasmodium falciparum and positive for the Saker-Solomons test, suggesting
persistent CQ pressure. The high frequency of self-medication, particularly among
pregnant women merits attention by public health authorities and comprehensive
investigation.
