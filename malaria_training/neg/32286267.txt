A promising new compound class for treating human malaria is the
imidazolopiperazines (IZP) class. IZP compounds KAF156 (Ganaplacide) and GNF179
are effective against Plasmodium symptomatic asexual blood-stage infections, and 
are able to prevent transmission and block infection in animal models. But
despite the identification of resistance mechanisms in P. falciparum, the mode of
action of IZPs remains unknown. To investigate, we here combine in vitro
evolution and genome analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with molecular,
metabolomic, and chemogenomic methods in P. falciparum. Our findings reveal that 
IZP-resistant S. cerevisiae clones carry mutations in genes involved in
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-based lipid homeostasis and autophagy. In Plasmodium, 
IZPs inhibit protein trafficking, block the establishment of new permeation
pathways, and cause ER expansion. Our data highlight a mechanism for blocking
parasite development that is distinct from those of standard compounds used to
treat malaria, and demonstrate the potential of IZPs for studying ER-dependent
protein processing.
