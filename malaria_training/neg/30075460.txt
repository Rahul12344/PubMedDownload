BACKGROUND: In November 2015, reuse of needles and syringes in conjunction with
an increase in cases of HCV at a clinic in Korea was reported and investigated by
public health authorities. Patients who received injections at the clinic from
the first time this infection control breach may have occurred in 2008 through
2015 when the practice was stopped were offered screening for HCV and other
blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, HTLV, HBV, syphilis, and malaria.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess whether an outbreak of hepatitis 
C had occurred among the potentially exposed clinic patients due to this
infection control breach.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed hepatitis C viral RNA load tests and genotyping using 
plasma from hepatitis C antibody-positive individuals who had visited the clinic 
between May 2008 and November 2015. We analyzed the core-E2 and NS5B regions of
the virus from RNA-positive samples by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on 
maximum likelihood analysis. To identify transmission risk factors and
epidemiological relationships among the patients, we reviewed their medical
records, assessed staff infection control practices and performed environmental
inspection of the clinic. Environmental samples from medication room surfaces and
medication vial contents were tested for HCV RNA.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the 1721 patients tested, 96 were IgG-positive and
70 were viral RNA-positive. Among the 61 patients whose viral loads were greater 
than the detection limit, 41 (67.2%) were classified as genotype 1a, 1 (1.6%) as 
genotype 1b, 18 (29.5%) as genotype 1, and one (1.6%) as genotype 2. After
sequencing, 12 genotype 1 cases were further classified as genotype 1a (11) or 1b
(1). The sequences of the core-E2 and NS5B regions of 45 patients formed a
monophyletic cluster distinct from genotype 1a. The hepatitis C virus sequences
from patients and environmental specimens were well-matched in the partial E1
gene region. We detected genotype 1a RNA in environmental specimens, indicating a
healthcare-associated outbreak caused by reuse of syringes and contaminated
multi-dose vials. Our molecular epidemiological investigation of hepatitis C
genotype 1a, rare in Korea, will aid investigations of infection sources during
future pathogen outbreaks.
