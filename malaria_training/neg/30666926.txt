A malaria survey was conducted in Atar, the northernmost oasis city in
Mauritania, during 2015-2016. All febrile patients in whom malaria was suspected 
were screened for malaria by using rapid diagnostic testing and microscopic
examination of blood smears and later confirmed by PCR. Of 453 suspected malaria 
cases, 108 (23.8%) were positive by rapid diagnostic testing, 154 (34.0%) by
microscopic examination, and 162 (35.7%) by PCR. Malaria cases were observed
throughout the year and among all age groups. Plasmodium vivax was present in
120/162 (74.1%) cases, P. falciparum in 4/162 (2.4%), and mixed P. falciparum-P. 
vivax in 38/162 (23.4%). Malaria is endemic in northern Mauritania and could be
spreading farther north in the Sahara, possibly because of human-driven
environmental changes. Further entomologic and parasitologic studies and
monitoring are needed to relate these findings to major Anopheles mosquito
vectors and to design and implement strategies for malaria prevention and
control.
