Malate and lactate dehydrogenases (MDH and LDH) are homologous, core metabolic
enzymes that share a fold and catalytic mechanism yet possess strict specificity 
for their substrates. In the Apicomplexa, convergent evolution of an unusual LDH 
from MDH produced a difference in specificity exceeding 12 orders of magnitude.
The mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary functional shift are currently 
unknown. Using ancestral protein resurrection, we find that specificity evolved
in apicomplexan LDHs by classic neofunctionalization characterized by long-range 
epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and few gain-of-function mutations of
large effect. In canonical MDHs and LDHs, a single residue in the active-site
loop governs substrate specificity: Arg102 in MDHs and Gln102 in LDHs. During the
evolution of the apicomplexan LDH, however, specificity switched via an insertion
that shifted the position and identity of this 'specificity residue' to Trp107f. 
Residues far from the active site also determine specificity, as shown by the
crystal structures of three ancestral proteins bracketing the key duplication
event. This work provides an unprecedented atomic-resolution view of evolutionary
trajectories creating a nascent enzymatic function.
