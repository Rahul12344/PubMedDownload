Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) mediates parasite
sequestration to the cerebral microvasculature via binding of DBLβ domains to
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and is associated with severe cerebral 
malaria. In a cohort of 187 young children from Papua New Guinea (PNG), we
examined baseline levels of antibody to the ICAM1-binding PfEMP1 domain,
DBLβ3PF11_0521, in comparison to four control antigens, including NTS-DBLα and
CIDR1 domains from another group A variant and a group B/C variant. Antibody
levels for the group A antigens were strongly associated with age and exposure.
Antibody responses to DBLβ3PF11_0521 were associated with a 37% reduced risk of
high-density clinical malaria in the follow-up period (adjusted incidence risk
ratio [aIRR] = 0.63 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.45 to 0.88; P = 0.007]) and 
a 25% reduction in risk of low-density clinical malaria (aIRR = 0.75 [95% CI,
0.55 to 1.01; P = 0.06]), while there was no such association for other variants.
Children who experienced severe malaria also had significantly lower levels of
antibody to DBLβ3PF11_0521 and the other group A domains than those that
experienced nonsevere malaria. Furthermore, a subset of PNG DBLβ sequences had
ICAM1-binding motifs, formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster, and were similar to
sequences from other areas of endemicity. PfEMP1 variants associated with these
DBLβ domains were enriched for DC4 and DC13 head structures implicated in
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) binding and severe malaria, suggesting
conservation of dual binding specificities. These results provide further support
for the development of specific classes of PfEMP1 as vaccine candidates and as
biomarkers for protective immunity against clinical P. falciparum malaria.
