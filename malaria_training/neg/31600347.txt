Kinesin-8 proteins are microtubule motors that are often involved in regulation
of mitotic spindle length and chromosome alignment. They move towards the plus
ends of spindle microtubules and regulate the dynamics of these ends due, at
least in some species, to their microtubule depolymerization activity. Plasmodium
spp. exhibit an atypical endomitotic cell division in which chromosome
condensation and spindle dynamics in the different proliferative stages are not
well understood. Genome-wide shared orthology analysis of Plasmodium spp.
revealed the presence of two kinesin-8 motor proteins, kinesin-8X and kinesin-8B.
Here we studied the biochemical properties of kinesin-8X and its role in parasite
proliferation. In vitro, kinesin-8X has motility and depolymerization activities 
like other kinesin-8 motors. To understand the role of Plasmodium kinesin-8X in
cell division, we used fluorescence-tagging and live cell imaging to define its
location, and gene targeting to analyse its function, during all proliferative
stages of the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei life cycle. The results revealed
a spatio-temporal involvement of kinesin-8X in spindle dynamics and an
association with both mitotic and meiotic spindles and the putative microtubule
organising centre (MTOC). Deletion of the kinesin-8X gene revealed a defect in
oocyst development, confirmed by ultrastructural studies, suggesting that this
protein is required for oocyst development and sporogony. Transcriptome analysis 
of Î”kinesin-8X gametocytes revealed modulated expression of genes involved mainly
in microtubule-based processes, chromosome organisation and the regulation of
gene expression, supporting a role for kinesin-8X in cell division. Kinesin-8X is
thus required for parasite proliferation within the mosquito and for transmission
to the vertebrate host.
