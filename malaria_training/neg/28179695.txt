OBJECTIVE: To establish a polymerase chain reaction method based on 18S ribosomal
ribonucleic acid gene for the detection of plasmodium deoxyribonucleic acid in
patients suffering from malaria symptoms.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2013 to October 
2014 in district Quetta of Pakistan's Balochistan province. Blood samples were
collected from patients suffering from general symptoms of malaria. A polymerase 
chain reaction-based technique was applied for the diagnosis of malaria and
detection of responsible species in the patients who were suspected to carry the 
parasite. Performance of this polymerase chain reaction method was compared
against the microscopy results. Parasite number was also calculated for
microscopy positive samples.All samples after the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid
isolation were subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and agarose
gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Of the 200 samples, 114(57%) were confirmed as positive and 86(43%) as
negative for malaria by microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction identified 124(62%)
samples as positive and 76(38%) as negative for malaria. The comparative analysis
of both diagnostic methods confirmed 109(54.5%) samples as positive by both
techniques. Besides, 5(6.58%) samples were identified as false positive and
15(12.1%) samples as false negative by polymerase chain reaction. Sensitivity,
specificity and positive predictive values for polymerase chain reaction in
comparison to microscopy were 87.98%, 93.42% and 96%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymerase chain reaction-based methods in malaria diagnosis and
species identification were found to be more effective than other techniques.
