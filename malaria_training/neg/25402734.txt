Over the past six decades, the drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum has
become an issue of utmost concern. Despite the remarkable progress that has been 
made in recent years in reducing the mortality rate to about 30% with the
scaling-up of vector control, introduction of artemisinin-based combination
therapies and other malaria control strategies, the confirmation of artemisinin
resistance on the Cambodia-Thailand border threatened all the previous success.
This review addresses the global scenario of antimalarial resistance and factors 
associated with it, with the main emphasis on futuristic approaches like
nanotechnology and stem cell therapy that may impede resistant malaria, along
with novel medications which are preparing to enter the global antimalarial
market. These novel studies are likely to escalate over the coming years and will
hopefully help to reduce the burden of malaria.
