Different functions have been attributed to CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory
T-cells (Tregs) during malaria infection. Herein, we describe the disparity in
Treg response and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines during infection with
Plasmodium berghei ANKA between young (3-week-old) and middle-aged (8-month-old) 
C57BL/6 mice. Young mice were susceptible to cerebral malaria (CM), while the
middle-aged mice were resistant to CM and succumbed to hyperparasitemia and
severe anemia. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î±, in young 
CM-susceptible mice were markedly higher than in middle-aged CM-resistant mice.
An increased absolute number of Tregs 3-5 days post-inoculation, co-occurring
with elevated IL-10 levels, was observed in middle-aged CM-resistant mice but not
in young CM-susceptible mice. Our findings suggest that Treg proliferation might 
be associated with the suppression of excessive pro-inflammatory Th1 response
during early malaria infection, leading to resistance to CM in the middle-aged
mice, possibly in an IL-10-dependent manner.
