Background: This study is aimed at investigating natriuretic peptide B (NPPB)
coexpression genes and their pathways involved in heart failure (HF) among
patients both with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: The microarray dataset GSE26887, containing 19 postischemic HF patients'
peripheral blood samples (7 with T2DM and 12 without T2DM), was examined to
detect the genes coexpressed with NPPB using the corr.test function in the R
packet. Furthermore, using online analytical tools, we determined the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the
coexpression genes. The modules and hub genes of the PPI network were then
identified using the Cytoscape software.
Results: In patients with T2DM, a total of 41 biological processes (BP), 20
cellular components (CC), 13 molecular functions (MF), and 41 pathways were
identified. Furthermore, a total of 61 BPs, 16 CCs, 13 MFs, and 22 pathways in
patients without T2DM were identified. In both groups of patients, 17 BPs, 10
CCs, 6 MFs, and 13 pathways were enriched. We also identified 173 intersectional 
coexpression genes (63 positively, 106 negatively, and 4 differently coexpressed 
in patients with and without T2DM, respectively) in both types of patients, which
were enriched in 16 BPs, 8 CCs, 3 MFs, and 8 KEGG pathways. Moreover, the PPI
network (containing 237 edges and 170 nodes) with the top module significantly
enriched in 4 BPs (tricarboxylic acid metabolic process, citrate metabolic
process, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and aerobic respiration) and 3 pathways
(citrate cycle, malaria parasite metabolic pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling
pathway in diabetic complications) was constructed. DECR1, BGN, TIMP1, VCAN, and 
CTCF are the top hub genes.
Conclusions: Our findings may elucidate the functions and roles of the NPPB gene 
in patients with postischemic HF and facilitate HF management.
