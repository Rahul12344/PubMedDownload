BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance against artemisinin in
Southeast Asia. Mutations in the P. falciparum Kelch-13 (Pfk13) gene are
associated with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the 
prevalence of mutations in PfK13 from sporozoite-stage parasites isolated from
the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus mosquitoes.
METHODS: Mosquitoes were caught by human-landing catches at two locations within 
the Khanh Phu commune, South-Central Vietnam. Identification of Anopheles species
was performed based on morphological features and nucleotide sequence analysis.
Sporozoite-infected salivary glands were stored on filter paper and at 4-6 °C. A 
nested-PCR targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was used for Plasmodium
species identification. Pfk13 was amplified by nested PCR, and subjected to
nucleotide sequencing.
RESULTS: Five of 33 P. falciparum sporozoite samples carried the P553L mutation
at the PfK13 locus. This mutation has been recorded previously in Vietnam, but
not in Khanh Hoa province, were surveys of K13 polymorphism have not previously
been carried out.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the utility of mosquito-stage malaria
parasite samples for studies on the molecular epidemiology of drug resistance.
