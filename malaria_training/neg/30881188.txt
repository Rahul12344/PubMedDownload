Background: Long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque monkeys are natural hosts of
Plasmodium knowlesi, which has been identified as a fifth malaria parasite
infecting humans. In this study, we investigated possible infection by this
Plasmodium parasite in macaque monkeys using a combination of polymerase chain
reaction amplification and sequencing.
Methods: Forty-five blood samples were obtained in 2010 from macaques in northern
Myanmar near Yunnan Province of China and investigated for possible infection
with Plasmodium species using a nested polymerase chain reaction method for
amplification of 18S SSU rRNA genes.
Results: Positive amplification was obtained from one monkey, and both sequence
and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the parasite was of the Hepatocystis
species lineage.
Conclusion: The results suggest that a combination of polymerase chain reaction
amplification and sequence identification would be necessary for detection of
Plasmodium knowlesi infection in both humans and its natural hosts.
