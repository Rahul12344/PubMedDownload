BACKGROUND: Anopheles funestus is one of the major malaria vectors in tropical
Africa, notably in Senegal. The highly anthropophilic and endophilic behaviours
of this mosquito make it a good target for vector control operations through the 
use of insecticide treated nets, long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor
residual spraying. However, little is known about patterns of resistance to
insecticides and the underlying resistance mechanisms in field populations of
this vector in Senegal.
METHODS: Here, we assessed the susceptibility status of An. funestus populations 
from Gankette Balla, located in northern Senegal and investigated the potential
resistance mechanisms.
RESULTS: WHO bioassays indicated that An. funestus is resistant to
lambda-cyhalothrin 0.05 % (74.64 % mortality), DDT 4 % (83.36 % mortality) and
deltamethrin 0.05 % (88.53 % mortality). Suspected resistance was observed to
permethrin 0.75 % (91.19 % mortality), bendiocarb 0.1 % (94.13 % mortality) and
dieldrin 4 % (96.41 % mortality). However, this population is fully susceptible
to malathion 5 % (100 % mortality) and fenitrothion 1 % (100 % mortality). The
microarray and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the lambda-cyhalothrin resistance 
in Gankette Balla is conferred by metabolic resistance mechanisms under the
probable control of cytochrome P450 genes among which CYP6M7 is the most
overexpressed. The absence of overexpression of the P450 gene, CYP6P9a, indicates
that the resistance mechanism in Senegal is different to that observed in
southern Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report of pyrethroid and DDT
resistance in An. funestus from Senegal and shows that resistance to insecticides
is not only confined to An. gambiae as previously thought. Therefore, urgent
action should be taken to manage the resistance in this species to ensure the
continued effectiveness of malaria control.
