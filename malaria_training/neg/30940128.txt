BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a global public health problem responsible for
445,000 deaths in 2016. While microscopy remains the mainstay of malaria
diagnosis, highly sensitive molecular methods for detection of low-grade
sub-microscopic infections are needed for surveillance studies and identifying
asymptomatic reservoirs of malaria transmission.
METHODS: The Plasmodium falciparum genome sequence was analysed to identify high 
copy number genes that improve P. falciparum parasite detection in blood by
RT-PCR. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)-specific
primers were evaluated for P. falciparum detection in hospital-based
microscopically positive dried blood spots and field-acquired whole blood from
asymptomatic individuals from Ghana.
RESULTS: PfEMP1 outperformed the Pf18S sequence for amplification-based P.
falciparum detection. PfEMP1 primers exhibited sevenfold higher sensitivity
compared to Pf18S primers for parasite genomic DNA. Probit analysis established a
95% detection threshold of 9.3 parasites/mL for PfEMP1 compared to
98.2 parasites/mL for Pf18S primers. The PfEMP1 primers also demonstrated
superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 100% (20/20) of dried blood spot
samples and 70% (69/98) of asymptomatic individuals as positive versus 55%
(11/20) and 54% (53/98), respectively, for Pf18S amplification.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish PfEMP1 as a novel amplification target for
highly sensitive detection of both acute infections from filter paper samples and
submicroscopic asymptomatic low-grade infections.
