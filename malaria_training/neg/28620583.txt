Continuous stage conversion and swift changes in the antigenic repertoire in
response to acquired immunity are hallmarks of complex eukaryotic pathogens,
including Plasmodium species, the causative agents of malaria. Efficient
elimination of Plasmodium liver stages prior to blood infection is one of the
most promising malaria vaccine strategies. Here, we describe different
genetically arrested parasites (GAPs) that have been engineered in Plasmodium
berghei, P. yoelii and P. falciparum and compare their vaccine potential. A
better understanding of the immunological mechanisms of prime and boost by
arrested sporozoites and experimental strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy by
further engineering existing GAPs into a more immunogenic form hold promise for
continuous improvements of GAP-based vaccines. A critical hurdle for vaccines
that elicit long-lasting protection against malaria, such as GAPs, is safety and 
efficacy in vulnerable populations. Vaccine research should focus on solutions
toward turning malaria into a vaccine-preventable disease, which would offer an
exciting new path of malaria control.
