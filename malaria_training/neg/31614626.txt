Complications due to malaria are caused mostly by host immunological responses.
Plasmodium falciparum subverts host immunity by various strategies, including
modulation in the host immune responses by regulating cytokines. The
transcriptional alterations of major cytokines and immunoregulators were analyzed
in this study through gene expression profiling in clinically defined subgroups
of P. falciparum patients. Malaria patients were included from Dhalai district
hospital of Tripura with uncomplicated malaria (UC) and severe malaria (SM) and
healthy controls from endemic and non-endemic areas of India. qPCR gene
expression analysis was performed for all factors and they were grouped into
three clusters based on their altered expressions. The first cluster was
downregulated with an increased parasitic burden which included T-BET, GATA3,
EOMES, TGF-β, STAT4, STAT6 and cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.
RANTES, IL-8, CCR8, and CXCR3 were decreased in the SM group. The second cluster 
was upregulated with severity and included TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β and IL-7. PD-1 and
BCL6 were increased in the SM group. The third cluster comprised of NF-κB and was
not altered. The level of perforin was suppressed while GrB expression was
elevated in SM. P. falciparum malaria burden is characterized by the modulation
of host immunity via compromization of T cell-mediated responses and suppression 
of innate immune-regulators.
