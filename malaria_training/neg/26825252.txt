To investigate the genetic diversity of the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane
antigen 1 (PfAMA1) gene in Southeast Asia, we determined PfAMA1 sequences from
135 field isolates collected from the China-Myanmar border area and compared them
with 956 publically available PfAMA1 sequences from seven global P. falciparum
populations. This analysis revealed high genetic diversity of PfAMA1 in global P.
falciparum populations with a total of 229 haplotypes identified. The genetic
diversity of PfAMA1 gene from the China-Myanmar border is not evenly distributed 
in the different domains of this gene. Sequence diversity in PfAMA1 from the
China-Myanmar border is lower than that observed in Thai, African and Oceanian
populations, but higher than that in the South American population. This appeared
to correlate well with the levels of endemicity of different malaria-endemic
regions, where hyperendemic regions favor genetic cross of the parasite isolates 
and generation of higher genetic diversity. Neutrality tests show significant
departure from neutrality in the entire ectodomain and Domain I of PfAMA1 in the 
China-Myanmar border parasite population. We found evidence supporting a
substantial continent-wise genetic structure among P. falciparum populations,
with the highest genetic differentiation detected between the China-Myanmar
border and the South American populations. Whereas no alleles were unique to a
specific region, there were considerable geographical differences in major
alleles and their frequencies, highlighting further necessity to include more
PfAMA1 alleles in vaccine designs.
