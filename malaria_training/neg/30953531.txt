BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex are the main malaria
vectors worldwide. Due to the lack of a vaccine to prevent malaria, the principal
way to reduce the impact of this disease relies on the use of chemical
insecticides to control its vectors. However, the intensive use of such compounds
has led to the emergence of insecticide resistance in several Anopheles
populations in Africa. This study aimed to investigate the presence of resistance
alleles in an Anopheles arabiensis population from the City of Praia, capital of 
the Archipelago Cabo Verde, one of the countries on the World Health Organization
list of countries that are on a path to eliminate local transmission of malaria.
METHODS: Larvae from the Anopheles genus were collected using a one-pint dipper
in three areas of City of Praia. Larvae were fed and maintained until the
emergence of adult mosquitoes, and these were morphologically identified. In
addition, molecular identification was performed using IGS markers and all An.
arabiensis samples were subjected to PCR to screen for mutations associated to
resistance in the Ace-1, Nav and GSTE2 genes.
RESULTS: From a total of 440 mosquitoes collected, 52.3% were morphologically
identified as An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and 46.7% as Anopheles pretoriensis. 
The molecular identification showed that 100% of the An. gambiae s.l. were An.
arabiensis. The mutations G119S in the Ace-1 gene and L119F in the GSTE2 gene
were screened but not found in any sample. However, sequencing analysis for GSTE2
revealed the presence of 37 haplotypes, 16 polymorphic sites and a high genetic
diversity (π = 2.67). The L1014S mutation in the Nav (voltage-gated sodium
channel gene) was detected at a frequency of 7.3%.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to investigate the circulation of insecticide
resistance alleles in An. arabiensis from Cabo Verde. The circulation of the
L1014S allele in the population of An. arabiensis in the city of Praia suggests
that pyrethroid resistance may arise, be quickly selected, and may affect the
process of malaria elimination in Cabo Verde. Molecular monitoring of resistance 
should continue in order to guide the development of strategies to be used in
vector control in the study region.
