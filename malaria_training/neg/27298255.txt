Sexual differentiation of malaria parasites into gametocytes in the vertebrate
host and subsequent gamete fertilization in mosquitoes is essential for the
spreading of the disease. The molecular processes orchestrating these transitions
are far from fully understood. Here, we report the first transcriptome analysis
of male and female Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes coupled with a comprehensive
proteome analysis. In male gametocytes there is an enrichment of proteins
involved in the formation of flagellated gametes; proteins involved in DNA
replication, chromatin organization and axoneme formation. On the other hand,
female gametocytes are enriched in proteins required for zygote formation and
functions after fertilization; protein-, lipid- and energy-metabolism.
Integration of transcriptome and proteome data revealed 512 highly expressed
maternal transcripts without corresponding protein expression indicating large
scale translational repression in P. falciparum female gametocytes for the first 
time. Despite a high degree of conservation between Plasmodium species, 260 of
these 'repressed transcripts' have not been previously described. Moreover, for
some of these genes, protein expression is only reported in oocysts and
sporozoites indicating that repressed transcripts can be partitioned into short- 
and long-term storage. Finally, these data sets provide an essential resource for
identification of vaccine/drug targets and for further mechanistic studies.
