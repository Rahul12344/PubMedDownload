BACKGROUND: The spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin
derivatives in Southeast Asia is a major source of concern and the emergence of
resistance in Africa would have dramatic consequences, by increasing malaria
mortality and morbidity. It is therefore urgent to implement regular monitoring
in sentinel sites in sub-Saharan Africa using robust and easy-to-implement tools.
The prevalence of k13-propeller mutations and the phenotypic profiles are poorly 
known in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, the k13-propeller polymorphism was compared to
both ex vivo susceptibility to DHA and early parasitological and clinical
responses to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT).
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected in 2015 in Yaoundé
(Cameroon) from patients treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination.
Samples were analysed for their susceptibility to artemisinin using the
k13-propeller sequencing, the ex vivo ring-stage survival assay, the in vivo
parasite positive rate and the clinical statute at day 2.
RESULTS: None of the collected isolates revealed the presence of resistance
mutations in the k13-propeller sequence. The median ring-stage survival rate for 
all the 64 interpretable isolates after a 6-hour pulse of 700 nM
dihydroartemisinin was low, 0.49% (IQR: 0-1.3). Total parasite clearance was
observed for 87.5% of patients and the remaining parasitaemic isolates (12.5%)
showed a high reduction of parasite load, ranging from 97.5 to 99.9%. Clinical
symptoms disappeared in 92.8% of cases.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the absence of k13-resistant genotypes in P. 
falciparum isolates from Cameroon. Only synonymous mutations were found with a
low prevalence (4.3%). A good association between k13 genotypes and the ex vivo
ring-stage survival assay or parasitological and clinical data was obtained.
These results give a baseline for the long-term monitoring of artemisinin
derivative efficacy in Africa.
