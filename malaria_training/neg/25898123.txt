Placental malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes that
bind to placental tissue. Binding is mediated by VAR2CSA, a parasite antigen
coded by the var gene, which interacts with chondroitin sulfate A (CSA).
Consequences include maternal anemia and fetal growth retardation.
Antibody-mediated immunity to placental malaria is acquired during successive
pregnancies, but the target of VAR2CSA-specific protective antibodies is unclear.
We assessed VAR2CSA-specific antibodies in pregnant women and analyzed their
relationships with protection against placental infection, preterm birth, and low
birthweight. Antibody responses to the N-terminal region of VAR2CSA during early 
pregnancy were associated with reduced risks for infections and low birthweight. 
Among women infected during pregnancy, an increase in CSA binding inhibition was 
associated with reduced risks for placental infection, preterm birth, and low
birthweight. These data suggest that antibodies against VAR2CSA N-terminal region
mediate immunity to placental malaria and associated outcomes. Our results
validate current vaccine development efforts with VAR2CSA N-terminal constructs.
