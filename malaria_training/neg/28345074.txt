Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper subsets
is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Due to extensive
heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in
differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for
systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and
computational analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model,
termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh
cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality
using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated that Th1/Tfh bifurcation
had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified
genes whose expression was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a
T-cell intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1 differentiation. We also
revealed the close molecular relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1
cells in this infection. Th1 and Tfh fates emerged from a highly proliferative
precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as
cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around 
bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In
particular, we found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a
Tfh fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and
computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources, a database
www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling
Th1/Tfh fate commitment, and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for
characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.
