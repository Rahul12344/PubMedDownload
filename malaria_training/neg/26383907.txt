In HIV-1-infected patients, variation at the HLA class I locus is associated with
disease progression, but few studies have assessed the influence of HLA alleles
on HIV-1 CRF01_AE infection, which is dominant in Thailand. We hypothesized that 
alleles predicted to confer more effective immune responses, such as HLA-B*46,
would protect against disease progression. HLA typing was performed on HIV-1
incident cases surviving until 1998-1999 and HIV-1-negative matched controls from
Thai army cohorts enrolled between 1991 and 1995. We assessed associations
between class I alleles and disease progression subsequent to HLA typing.
Ninety-nine HIV-1-incident cases were followed for a median of 3.7 years after
HLA typing; during this time, 58 participants died. Two alleles were associated
with mortality: HLA B*51 was protective (3-year survival B*51(pos) vs. B*51(neg):
75% vs. 52%; p = 0.034) whereas Cw*04 was deleterious (3-year survival Cw*04(pos)
vs. Cw*04(neg): 39% vs. 60%; p = 0.027). HLA-B*46 was not associated with disease
progression. Alleles present at different frequencies in HIV-1-incident compared 
with HIV-1-negative men included HLA-A*02:03, B*35, B*15, and C*08. 1. In
conclusion in this Thai army cohort, HLA-B*51 was associated with lower
mortality, confirming that this allele, which is protective in clade B HIV-1
infection, has a similar effect on HIV CRF01_AE infection. The deleterious effect
of HLA-Cw*04 must be interpreted with caution because it may be in linkage
disequilibrium with disease-susceptible HLA-B alleles. We did not find that
HLA-B*46 was protective. These findings may inform vaccine development for areas 
of the world in which HIV-1 CRF01_AE infection is prevalent.
