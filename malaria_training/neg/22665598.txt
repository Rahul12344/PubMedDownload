Because malaria is still a significant problem worldwide, additional control
methods need to be developed. The Plasmodium sporozoite is a good target for
control measures because it displays dual infectivity for both mosquito and
vertebrate host tissues. The Plasmodium falciparum gene, PFE0565w, was chosen as 
a candidate for study based on data from PlasmoDB, the Plasmodium database,
indicating that it is expressed both at the transcriptional and protein levels in
sporozoites, likely encodes a putative surface protein, and may have a potential 
role in the invasion of host tissues. Additional sequence analysis shows that the
PFE0565w protein has orthologs in other Plasmodium species, but none outside of
the genus Plasmodium. PFE0565w expresses transcript during both the sporozoite
and erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle, where an alternative
transcript was discovered during the erythrocytic stages. Data show that
transcript is not present during axenic exoerythrocytic stages. Despite
transcript being present in several life cycle stages, the PFE0565w protein is
present only during the salivary gland sporozoite stage. Because the PFE0565w
protein is present in salivary gland sporozoites, it could be a novel candidate
for a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine.
