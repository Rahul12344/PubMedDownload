We evaluated markers of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolated 
in Kampala in 2014. By standard in vitro assays, all isolates were highly
sensitive to dihydroartemisinin (DHA). By the ring-stage survival assay, after a 
6-h DHA pulse, parasitemia was undetectable in 40 of 43 cultures at 72 h. Two of 
53 isolates had nonsynonymous K13-propeller gene polymorphisms but did not have
the mutations associated with resistance in Asia. Thus, we did not see evidence
for artemisinin resistance in Uganda.
