BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked
genetic disorder that results in impaired enzyme activity. Although G6PD
deficiency is globally distributed it is more prevalent in malaria-endemic
countries. Several mutations have been identified in the G6PD gene, which alter
enzyme activity. The G6PD genotype predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa is
the G6PDB (G6PD376A) with (G6PD376G) and G6PDA- (G6PD376G/202A, G6PD376G/542T,
G6PD376G/680T and G6PD376G/968C) occurring at lower frequencies.
AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and 
asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum carriage in children living in southern Ghana 
and determine whether G6PD deficiency influences asymptomatic carriage of P.
falciparum parasites.
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained once a month from 170 healthy Ghanaian
school children aged between 5 and 12 years from Basic schools in two communities
Obom and Abura with similar rainfall patterns and malaria peak seasons. G6PD
enzyme activity was assessed using the qualitative G6PD RDT kit (AccessBIO). G6PD
genotyping and asymptomatic parasite carriage was determined by PCR followed by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of DNA extracted from dried blood
spots.
RESULTS: The only sub-Saharan G6PD A- allele detected was the A376G/G202A found
in 12.4 % (21/170), of the children and distributed as 4.1 % (7/170) A-, 1.8 %
(3/170) A-/A- homozygous deficient males and females and 6.5 % (11/170) A/A- and 
B/A- heterozygous deficient females. Phenotypically, 10.6 % (15/142) of the
children were G6PD deficient. The asymptomatic carriage of P. falciparum by PCR
was 50, 29.4, 38.2 and 38.8 % over the months of February through May 2015,
respectively, and 28.8, 22.4, 25.9 and 5.9 % by microscopy during the same
periods.
CONCLUSIONS: G6PD deficiency was significantly associated with a lowered risk of 
PCR-estimated asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage in children during the off peak
malaria season in Southern Ghana.
