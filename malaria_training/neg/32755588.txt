Southeast Asia has been the hotbed for the development of drug-resistant malaria 
parasites, including those with resistance to artemisinin combination therapy.
While mutations in the kelch propeller domain (K13 mutations) are associated with
artemisinin resistance, a range of evidence suggests that other factors are
critical for the establishment and subsequent transmission of resistance in the
field. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of DNA damage and repair in the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find a strong link between enhanced
DNA damage repair and artemisinin resistance. This experimental observation is
further supported when variations in seven known DNA repair genes are found in
resistant parasites, with six of these mutations being associated with K13
mutations. Our data provide important insights on confounding factors that are
important for the establishment and spread of artemisinin resistance and may
explain why resistance has not yet arisen in Africa.
