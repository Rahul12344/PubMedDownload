OBJECTIVES: Vivax malaria has reemerged and become endemic in Korea. Our study
aimed to analyze by both longitudinal and cross-sectional genetic diversity of
this malaria based on the P vivax Merozoite Surface Protein (PvMSP) gene
parasites recently found in the Korean peninsula.
METHODS: PvMSP-1 gene sequence analysis from P vivax isolates (n = 835) during
the 1996-2010 period were longitudinally analyzed and the isolates from the
Korean peninsula through South Korea, the demilitarized zone and North Korea
collected in 2008-2010 were enrolled in an overall analysis of MSP-1 gene
diversity.
RESULTS: New recombinant subtypes and severe multiple-cloneinfection rates were
observed in recent vivax parasites. Regional variation was also observed in the
study sites.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the great complexity of genetic variation and
rapid dissemination of genes in P vivax. It also showed interesting patterns of
diversity depending, on the region in the Korean Peninsula. Understanding the
parasiteninsula. Under genetic variation may help to analyze trends and assess
the extent of endemic malaria in Korea.
