Mosquito-transmitted diseases, including malaria and dengue, are a major threat
to human health around the globe, affecting millions each year. A diverse array
of next-generation tools has been designed to eliminate mosquito populations or
to replace them with mosquitoes that are less capable of transmitting key
pathogens. Many of these new approaches have been built on recent advances in
CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing. These initiatives have driven the development
of pathogen-resistant lines, new genetics-based sexing methods, and new methods
of driving desirable genetic traits into mosquito populations. Many other
emerging tools involve microorganisms, including two strategies involving
Wolbachia that are achieving great success in the field. At the same time, other 
mosquito-associated bacteria, fungi, and even viruses represent untapped sources 
of new mosquitocidal or antipathogen compounds. Although there are still hurdles 
to be overcome, the prospect that such approaches will reduce the impact of these
diseases is highly encouraging.
