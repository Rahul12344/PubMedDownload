The genome sequence of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, was
released almost a decade ago. A majority of the Plasmodium genome, however,
remains annotated to code for hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. The
introduction of forward genetics has provided novel means to gain a better
understanding of gene functions and their associated phenotypes in Plasmodium.
Even with certain limitations, the technique has already shown significant
promise to increase our understanding of parasite biology needed for rationalized
drug and vaccine design. Further improvements to the mutagenesis technique and
the design of novel genetic screens should lead us to some exciting discoveries
about the critical weaknesses of Plasmodium, and greatly aid in the development
of new disease intervention strategies.
