BACKGROUND: For the purpose of studying functional human dendritic cells (DCs) in
a humanized mouse model that mimics the human immune system (HIS), a model
referred to as HIS mice was established.
METHODS: Human immune system mice were made by engrafting NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammanull 
(NSG) mice with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) following the transduction 
of genes encoding human cytokines and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2.1 by
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that human DC subsets, such as CD141+CD11c+ and
CD1c+CD11c+ myeloid DCs, distribute throughout several organs in HIS mice
including blood, bone marrow, spleen, and draining lymph nodes. The CD141+CD11c+ 
and CD1c+CD11c+ human DCs isolated from HIS mice immunized with adenoviruses
expressing malaria/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epitopes were able to
induce the proliferation of malaria/HIV epitopes-specific human CD8+ T cells in
vitro. Upregulation of CD1c was also observed in human CD141+ DCs 1 day after
immunization with the adenovirus-based vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of such a humanized mouse model that mounts functional
human DCs enables preclinical assessment of the immunogenicity of human vaccines 
in vivo.
