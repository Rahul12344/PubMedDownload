Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been documented in
southeast Asia and may already be spreading in that region. Molecular markers are
important tools for monitoring the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.
Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PF3D7_1343700 kelch
propeller (K13-propeller) domain were shown to be associated with artemisinin
resistance in vivo and in vitro. The prevalence and role of K13-propeller
mutations are poorly known in sub-Saharan Africa. K13-propeller mutations were
genotyped by direct sequencing of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplicons from dried blood spots of pre-treatment falciparum malaria infections
collected before and after the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
as first-line therapy in Mali. Although K13-propeller mutations previously
associated with delayed parasite clearance in Cambodia were not identified, 26
K13-propeller mutations were identified in both recent samples and pre-ACT
infections. Parasite clearance time was comparable between infections with
non-synonymous K13-propeller mutations and infections with the reference allele. 
These findings suggest that K13-propeller mutations are present in
artemisinin-sensitive parasites and that they preceded the wide use of ACTs in
Mali.
