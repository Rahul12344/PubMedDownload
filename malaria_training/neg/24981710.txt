BACKGROUND: Malaria that is caused by Plasmodium vivax is the most widely
distributed human malaria. Its recent resurgence in many parts of the world,
including the Republic of Korea (ROK), emphasizes the importance of improved
access to the early and accurate detection of P. vivax to reduce disease burden. 
In this study, a rapid and efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP)-based method was developed and validated using blood samples from
malaria-suspected patients.
METHOD: A LAMP assay targeting the α-tubulin gene for the detection of P. vivax
was developed with six primers that recognize different regions of the target
gene. The diagnostic performance of the α-tubulin LAMP assay was compared to
three other tests: microscopic examinations, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and
nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using 177 whole blood specimens obtained
from ROK military personnel from May to December 2011.
RESULTS: The α-tubulin LAMP assay was highly sensitive with a detection limit of 
100 copies of P. vivax α-tubulin gene per reaction within 50 min. It specifically
amplified the target gene only from P. vivax. Validation of the α-tubulin LAMP
assay showed that the assay had the highest sensitivity (P < 0.001 versus
microscopy; P = 0.0023 versus RDT) when nested PCR was used as the gold standard 
and better agreement (concordance: 94.9%, kappa value: 0.865) with nested PCR
than RDT and microscopy. A Receiver Operation Characteristics analysis showed
that the diagnostic accuracy of the α-tubulin LAMP assay for vivax malaria was
higher (Area Under Curve = 0.908) than RDT and microscopy.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the P. vivax α-tubulin LAMP assay, which can
be used to diagnose early infections of vivax malaria, is an alternative
molecular diagnostic tool and a point-of-care test that may help to prevent
transmission in endemic areas.
