The obligate intracellular parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. invade
host cells by injecting a protein complex into the membrane of the targeted cell 
that bridges the two cells through the assembly of a ring-like junction. This
circular junction stretches while the parasites apply a traction force to pass
through, a step that typically concurs with transient constriction of the
parasite body. Here we analyse F-actin dynamics during host cell invasion.
Super-resolution microscopy and real-time imaging highlighted an F-actin pool at 
the apex of pre-invading parasite, an F-actin ring at the junction area during
invasion but also networks of perinuclear and posteriorly localised F-actin.
Mutant parasites with dysfunctional acto-myosin showed significant decrease of
junctional and perinuclear F-actin and are coincidently affected in nuclear
passage through the junction. We propose that the F-actin machinery eases nuclear
passage by stabilising the junction and pushing the nucleus through the
constriction. Our analysis suggests that the junction opposes resistance to the
passage of the parasite's nucleus and provides the first evidence for a dual
contribution of actin-forces during host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites.
