BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in
Southeast Asia and poses a threat to malaria control and elimination. Mutations
in a P. falciparum gene encoding a kelch protein on chromosome 13 have been
associated with delayed parasite clearance following artemisinin treatment
elsewhere in the region, but not yet in China.
METHODS: Therapeutic efficacy studies of artesunate and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were conducted from 2009 to 2012 in the Yunnan
Province of China near the border with Myanmar. K13 mutations were genotyped by
capillary sequencing of DNA extracted from dried blood spots collected in these
clinical trials and in routine surveillance. Associations between K13 mutations
and delayed parasite clearance were tested using regression models.
RESULTS: Parasite clearance half-lives were prolonged after artemisinin
treatment, with 44% of infections having half-lives >5 hours (n = 109). Fourteen 
mutations in K13 were observed, with an overall prevalence of 47.7% (n = 329). A 
single mutation, F446I, predominated, with a prevalence of 36.5%. Infections with
F446I were significantly associated with parasitemia on day 3 following
artemisinin treatment and with longer clearance half-lives.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum infections in southern China displayed
markedly delayed clearance following artemisinin treatment. F446I was the
predominant K13 mutation and was associated with delayed parasite clearance.
