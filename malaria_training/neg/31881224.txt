AIMS: Endothelial cell (EC) tube formation is crucial for tumor angiogenesis,
which becomes a target for chemotherapy. The anti-malaria agent
dihydroartemisinin (DHA) inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis. The aim of this
study was to investigate the effects of DHA on EC tube formation and the
underlying mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
cultured with different concentrations of DHA, and the tube formation was
measured by in vitro angiogenesis assay. The protein levels of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), phosphorylated STAT3 and fatty
acid synthase (FASN) were detected by Western blotting. The gene expression of
FASN was determined by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The FASN
siRNA and STAT3 (Y705D) vector were introduced into HUVECs by lipofectin
transfection.
KEY FINDINGS: DHA treatment inhibited tube formation, and the phosphorylation of 
STAT3 on Y705 of HUVECs. The expression of FASN was down-regulated by DHA and
STAT3 inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of DHA on FASN expression in HUVECs was
eliminated by co-treatment with the STAT3 inhibitor. Over-expression of STAT3
(Y705D) relieved the inhibitory effect of DHA on tube-formation and FASN
expression. Under hypoxia condition, expression of FASN was up-regulated but
inhibited by DHA treatment in HUVECs through suppression of STAT3
phosphorylation.
SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that DHA inhibits the protein level of FASN via
attenuation of the Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3, and subsequently inhibits tube 
formation of HUVECs. Our results support the therapeutic potential of DHA on
angiogenesis.
