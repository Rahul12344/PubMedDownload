The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses deadly pathogens such as malaria and
Cryptosporidium. Apicomplexa cell division is mechanistically divergent from that
of their mammalian host, potentially representing an attractive source of drug
targets. Depending on the species, apicomplexan parasites can modulate the output
of cell division, producing two to thousands of daughter cells at once. The
inherent flexibility of their cell division mechanisms allows these parasites to 
adapt to different niches, facilitating their dissemination. Toxoplasma gondii
tachyzoites divide using a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny. This 
process involves a single round of DNA replication, closed nuclear mitosis, and
assembly of two daughter cells within a mother. In higher Eukaryotes, the
four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Aurora kinase B
(ARKB)/INCENP/Borealin/Survivin) promotes chromosome bi-orientation by detaching 
incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, playing an essential role in
controlling cell division fidelity. Herein, we report the characterization of the
Toxoplasma CPC (Aurora kinase 1 (Ark1)/INCENP1/INCENP2). We show that the CPC
exhibits dynamic localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner. TgArk1 interacts 
with both TgINCENPs, with TgINCENP2 being essential for its translocation to the 
nucleus. While TgINCENP1 appears to be dispensable, interfering with TgArk1 or
TgINCENP2 results in pronounced division and growth defects. Significant
anti-cancer drug development efforts have focused on targeting human ARKB.
Parasite treatment with low doses of hesperadin, a known inhibitor of human ARKB 
at higher concentrations, phenocopies the TgArk1 and TgINCENP2 mutants. Overall, 
our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning cell cycle
control in Apicomplexa, and highlights TgArk1 as potential drug target.
