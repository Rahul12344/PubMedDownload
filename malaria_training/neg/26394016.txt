Thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) is a key immune factor that determines
mosquito resistance to a wide range of pathogens, including malaria parasites.
Here we report a new allele-specific function of TEP1 in male fertility. We
demonstrate that during spermatogenesis TEP1 binds to and removes damaged cells
through the same complement-like cascade that kills malaria parasites in the
mosquito midgut. Further, higher fertility rates are mediated by an allele that
renders the mosquito susceptible to Plasmodium. By elucidating the molecular and 
genetic mechanisms underlying TEP1 function in spermatogenesis, our study
suggests that pleiotropic antagonism between reproduction and immunity may shape 
resistance of mosquito populations to malaria parasites.
