BACKGROUND: Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria which is one of the world's
most threatening diseases. Anopheles dirus (sensu stricto) is among the main
vectors of malaria in South East Asia. The mosquito innate immune response is the
first line of defence against malaria parasites during its development. The
immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, influences
anti-Plasmodium falciparum activity in Anopheles gambiae, An. stephensi and An.
albimanus. The aim of the study was to determine the role of Rel2, an IMD
pathway-controlled NF-kappaβ transcription factor, in An. dirus.
METHODS: RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed on the Rel2 gene. 
Double-stranded Rel2 was constructed and injected into the thorax of female
mosquitoes. The injected mosquitoes were fed on a P. falciparum gametocyte
culture and dissected on day 7-9 post-feeding in order to count the oocysts. A
survival analysis was conducted by exposing the dsRNA injected mosquitoes to
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the Rel2 gene in An. dirus has two
isoforms, short length and full length. RNA interference-mediated gene silencing 
of Rel2 showed that the latter is involved in protection against P. falciparum,
Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus) with Lys-type peptidoglycan and
Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) with DAP-type peptidoglycan.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that there are similarities in the splicing
events and functionality of the Rel2 gene, between the Anopheles species. Among
all the important anophelines, the immunity of only a few has been thoroughly
investigated. In order to develop novel vector-based control strategies and
restrict malaria transmission, the immune pathways of these important vectors
should be thoroughly investigated.
