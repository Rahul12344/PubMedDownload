The Plasmodium falciparum histone deacetylase Sir2a localizes at telomeric
regions where it contributes to epigenetic silencing of clonally variant
virulence genes. Apart from telomeres, PfSir2a also accumulates in the nucleolus,
which harbours the developmentally regulated ribosomal RNA genes. Here we
investigate the nucleolar function of PfSir2a and demonstrate that PfSir2a
fine-tunes ribosomal RNA gene transcription. Using a parasite line in which
PfSir2a has been disrupted, we observe that histones near the transcription start
sites of all ribosomal RNA genes are hyperacetylated and that transcription of
ribosomal RNA genes is upregulated. Complementation of the PfSir2a-disrupted
parasites restores the ribosomal RNA levels, whereas PfSir2a overexpression in
wild-type parasites decreases ribosomal RNA synthesis. Furthermore, we observe
that PfSir2a modulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis is linked to an altered number
of daughter merozoites and the parasite multiplication rate. These findings
provide new insights into an epigenetic mechanism that controls malaria parasite 
proliferation and virulence.
