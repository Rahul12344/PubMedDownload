Variegated surface antigen expression is key to chronic infection and
pathogenesis of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This protozoan 
parasite expresses distinct surface molecules that are encoded by clonally
variant gene families such as var, rif and stevor. The molecular mechanisms
governing activation of individual members remain ill-defined. To investigate the
molecular events of the initial transcriptional activation process we focused on 
a member of the apicomplexan ApiAP2 transcription factor family predicted to bind
to the 5' upstream regions of the var gene family, AP2-exp (PF3D7_1466400).
Viable AP2-exp mutant parasites rely on expressing no less than a short truncated
protein including the N-terminal AP2 DNA-binding domain. RNA-seq analysis in
mutant parasites revealed transcriptional changes in a subset of exported
proteins encoded by clonally variant gene families. Upregulation of RIFINs and
STEVORs was validated at the protein levels. In addition, morphological
alterations were observed on the surface of the host cells infected by the
mutants. This work points to a complex regulatory network of clonally variant
gene families in which transcription of a subset of members is regulated by the
same transcription factor. In addition, we highlight the importance of the
non-DNA binding AP2 domain in functional gene regulation.
