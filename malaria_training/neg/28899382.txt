BACKGROUND: Avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and other Haemosporida
(Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon spp.) form a diverse group of vector-transmitted 
blood parasites that are abundant in many bird families. Recent studies have
suggested that corvids may be an important host for Plasmodium spp. and
Leucocytozoon spp.
METHODS: To investigate the diversity of Haemosporida of resident carrion crows
(Corvus corone) and Eurasian Magpies (Pica pica) in southwest Germany, 100 liver 
samples of corvids were examined using a nested PCR method to amplify a 1063 bp
fragment of the haemosporidian mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The phylogenetic 
relationship of parasite lineages obtained from these birds was inferred.
RESULTS: Haemosporidian DNA was detected in 85 carrion crows (89.5%) and in all
five Eurasian Magpies. The most abundant parasite genus was Leucocytozoon with a 
prevalence of 85.3% (n = 95). 65.3% of the samples (n = 62) contained multiple
infections. Thirteen haemosporidian lineages were isolated from the corvid
samples. Female carrion crows were more likely infected with haemosporidian
parasites than males.
DISCUSSION: This study provides the first insight into the diversity of
haemosporidian parasites of corvids in Germany. Very high prevalences were found 
and based on the applied diagnostic method also a high amount of multiple
infections could be detected. Due to the high diversity of haemosporidian
parasites found in corvids, they seem to be excellent model organisms to test
species deliminations in haemosporidian parasites.
