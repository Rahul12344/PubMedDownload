BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a malaria hypo-endemic country sharing borders with
India and Myanmar. Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) remains successful in
Bangladesh. An increase of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites on the
Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders is worrisome. K13 propeller gene
(PF3D7_1343700 or PF13_0238) mutations have been linked to both in vitro
artemisinin resistance and in vivo slow parasite clearance rates. This group
undertook to evaluate if mutations seen in Cambodia have emerged in Bangladesh
where ACT use is now standard for a decade.
METHODS: Samples were obtained from Plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria
patients from Upazila health complexes (UHC) between 2009 and 2013 in seven
endemic districts of Bangladesh. These districts included Khagrachari (Matiranga 
UHC), Rangamati (Rajasthali UHC), Cox's Bazar (Ramu and Ukhia UHC), Bandarban
(Lama UHC), Mymensingh (Haluaghat UHC), Netrokona (Durgapur and Kalmakanda UHC), 
and Moulvibazar (Sreemangal and Kamalganj UHC).
RESULTS: Out of 296 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples, 271 (91.6%)
were confirmed as mono-infections by both real-time PCR and nested PCR. The K13
propeller gene from 253 (93.4%) samples was sequenced bi-directionally. One
non-synonymous mutation (A578S) was found in Bangladeshi clinical isolates. The
A578S mutation was confirmed and lies adjacent to the C580Y mutation, the major
mutation causing delayed parasite clearance in Cambodia. Based on computational
modeling A578S should have a significant effect on tertiary structure of the
protein.
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that P. falciparum in Bangladesh remains free of the
C580Y mutation linked to delayed parasite clearance. However, the mutation A578S 
is present and based on structural analysis could affect K13 gene function.
Further in vivo clinical studies are required to validate the effect of this
mutation.
