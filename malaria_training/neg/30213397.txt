Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
affecting approximately 1500 patients per year. Three forms of BL exist
(sporadic, endemic, immunodeficiency associated) and the endemic form was first
discovered as being driven by the Epstein Barr virus in areas of the world where 
malaria is prevalent. BL has the characteristic t8; 14 cytogenetic translocation 
that leads to constitutive activation of the MYC gene, which drives BL cell
division. Therapy of BL has resulted in cure for many patients but significant
toxicity and treatment related complications remains problematic in the approach 
to BL therapy. Treatment options for relapsed and refractory disease remain
limited however novel treatments are being studied to block MYC activation, and
cold lead to promising options for patients with relapsed and refractory disease.
