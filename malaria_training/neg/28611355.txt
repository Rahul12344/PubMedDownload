The continued success of malaria control efforts requires the development, study 
and implementation of new technologies that circumvent insecticide resistance. We
previously demonstrated that fungal pathogens can provide an effective delivery
system for mosquitocidal or malariacidal biomolecules. Here we compared genes
from arthropod predators encoding insect specific sodium, potassium and calcium
channel blockers for their ability to improve the efficacy of Metarhizium against
wild-caught, insecticide-resistant anophelines. Toxins expressed under control of
a hemolymph-specific promoter increased fungal lethality to mosquitoes at spore
dosages as low as one conidium per mosquito. One of the most potent, the EPA
approved Hybrid (Ca++/K+ channel blocker), was studied for pre-lethal effects.
These included reduced blood feeding behavior, with almost 100% of insects
infected with ~6 spores unable to transmit malaria within 5 days post-infection, 
surpassing the World Health Organization threshold for successful vector control 
agents. Furthermore, recombinant strains co-expressing Hybrid toxin and AaIT (Na+
channel blocker) produced synergistic effects, requiring 45% fewer spores to kill
half of the mosquitoes in 5 days as single toxin strains. Our results identify a 
repertoire of toxins with different modes of action that improve the utility of
entomopathogens as a technology that is compatible with existing
insecticide-based control methods.
