BACKGROUND: Phlebotomus papatasi sand flies are major vectors of Leishmania major
and phlebovirus infection in North Africa and across the Middle East to the
Indian subcontinent. Population genetics is a valuable tool in understanding the 
level of genetic variability present in vector populations, vector competence,
and the development of novel control strategies. This study investigated the
genetic differentiation between P. papatasi populations in Egypt and Jordan that 
inhabit distinct ecotopes and compared this structure to P. papatasi populations 
from a broader geographical range.
METHODS: A 461 base pair (bp) fragment from the mtDNA cytochrome b (cyt b) gene
was PCR amplified and sequenced from 116 individual female sand flies from Aswan 
and North Sinai, Egypt, as well as Swaimeh and Malka, Jordan. Haplotypes were
identified and used to generate a median-joining network, F ST values and
isolation-by-distance were also evaluated. Additional sand fly individuals from
Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Libya, Tunisia and Turkey were included as
well as previously published haplotypes to provide a geographically broad genetic
variation analysis.
RESULTS: Thirteen haplotypes displaying nine variant sites were identified from
P. papatasi collected in Egypt and Jordan. No private haplotypes were identified 
from samples in North Sinai, Egypt, two were observed in Aswan, Egypt, four from 
Swaimeh, Jordan and two in Malka, Jordan. The Jordan populations clustered
separately from the Egypt populations and produced more private haplotypes than
those from Egypt. Pairwise F ST values fall in the range 0.024-0.648.
CONCLUSION: The clustering patterns and pairwise F ST values indicate a strong
differentiation between Egyptian and Jordanian populations, although this
population structure is not due to isolation-by-distance. Other factors, such as 
environmental influences and the genetic variability in the circulating Le. major
parasites, could possibly contribute to this heterogeneity. The present study
aligns with previous reports in that pockets of genetic differentiation exists
between populations of this widely dispersed species but, overall, the species
remains relatively homogeneous.
