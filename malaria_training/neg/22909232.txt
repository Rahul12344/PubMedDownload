As a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide, selection pressure by
Plasmodium falciparum continues to shape the human genome. Severe disturbances
within the microcirculation result from the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to 
host receptors on monocytes, platelets, and endothelium. In this prospective
study, we compared expression of all major host cytoadhesion receptors among
Ugandan children presenting with uncomplicated malaria (n = 1078) versus children
with severe malaria (n = 855), including cerebral malaria (n = 174), severe
anaemia (n = 522), and lactic acidosis (n = 154). We report a significant
survival advantage attributed to blood group O and increased monocyte expression 
of CD36 and ICAM1 (CD54). The high case fatality rate syndromes of cerebral
malaria and lactic acidosis were associated with high platelet CD36 expression
and thrombocytopenia, and severe malaria anaemia was characterized by low ICAM1
expression. In a logistic regression model of disease severity, odds ratios for
the mitigating effects of blood group O, CD36, and ICAM1 phenotypes were greater 
than that of sickle haemoglobin. Host genetic adaptations to Plasmodium
falciparum suggest new potential malaria treatment strategies.
