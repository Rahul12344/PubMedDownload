Plasmodium development within its mosquito vector is an essential step in malaria
transmission, as illustrated in world regions where malaria was successfully
eradicated via vector control. The innate immune system of most mosquitoes is
able to completely clear a Plasmodium infection, preventing parasite transmission
to humans. Understanding the biological basis of this phenomenon is expected to
inspire new strategies to curb malaria incidence in countries where vector
control via insecticides is unpractical, or inefficient because insecticide
resistance genes have spread across mosquito populations. Several aspects of
mosquito biology that condition the success of the parasite in colonizing its
vector begin to be understood at the molecular level, and a wealth of recently
published data highlights the multifaceted nature of the mosquito response
against parasite invasion. In this brief review, we attempt to provide an
integrated view of the challenges faced by the parasite to successfully invade
its mosquito host, and discuss the possible intervention strategies that could
exploit this knowledge for the fight against human malaria.
