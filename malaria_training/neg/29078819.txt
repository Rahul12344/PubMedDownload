OBJECTIVE: Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
in East and Central Africa among children. Persistent infections with Epstein
Barr virus or Plasmodium falciparum are associated with immune hyperstimulation. 
It is hypothesised that inadvertent cytokine responses to infections indirectly
or directly influence B cell neoplastic transformation through c-myelocytomatosis
(c-myc) gene translocation. We sought to describe cytokines in children and
adolescents with BL. Participants were recruited from western Kenya with parental
consent, diagnosis confirmed using histology and consensus panel of
immunohistochemistry antibodies. T helper1/2/17A and transforming growth
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) cytokines were estimated using cytometric bead array in
plasma. Complete blood counts (CBC) were determined by Beckman Coulter®.
RESULTS: Out of 104 enrolled participants, 32% were confirmed BL and 68% grouped 
as non-BL. Mean (pg/ml) levels of cytokines in BL and non-BL were: interleukin
(IL)-6 100.3 and 39.4 p = 0.152; IL-10 11.5 and 12.5 p = 0.363; IL-17A 17.8 and
64.9 p = 0.094 respectively. Expressions of interferon-γ, IL-2 and tumour
necrosis factor-α were low and TGF-β1 undetectable in both groups. Mean CBC
differed between the two groups before and after chemotherapy, WBC being
significantly so. Interleukin-6, IL-17A and IL-10 responses to infections in the 
study area may be associated with pathogenesis and be potential therapeutic
targets.
