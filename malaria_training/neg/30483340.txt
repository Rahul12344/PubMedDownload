Background: Although Plasmodium vivax is usually known as benign malaria, some
variations of the parasite can result in acute and sever infection. In this study
we tried to determine some genetic variations in PvAMA-1 antigen among the
samples were collected form southeastern Iran.
Methods: About two ml blood samples were collected into EDTA pre-dosed tubes from
30 P. vivax-infected patients individually between 2011 and 2013. A Giemsa
stained thick and thin blood film was prepared from each of the patients. A
PCR-RFLP technique was employed using EcoR-1, Pvu-II and Hind3 restriction
enzymes to determine the allelic variations of the antigen.
Results: A 1300bp gene corresponding to PvAMA-1 was selected for the
amplification process. Among the total cases identified in this study 90% showed 
similar bounds when exposed to the restriction enzymes. Nine isolates (accession 
numbers: KF435081-KF435083 and JF682785-JF682790) were identified and registered 
in Gene bank. Identity among isolates was more than 96% in nucleotide level.
Dendrogram clarified a close relationship among the clusters in spite of
geographical distribution of the parasite.
Conclusion: This study increased our data about prevalence and variation of
PvAMA-1 alleles amongst P. vivax isolates in southeastern parts of Iran where
besides native population bears considerable Afghan and Pakistani immigrants.
