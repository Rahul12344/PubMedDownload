BACKGROUND: Plasmodium species feature only four to eight nuclear ribosomal units
on different chromosomes, which are assumed to evolve independently according to 
a birth-and-death model, in which new variants originate by duplication and
others are deleted throughout time. Moreover, distinct ribosomal units were shown
to be expressed during different developmental stages in the vertebrate and
mosquito hosts. Here, the 18S rDNA sequences of 32 species of avian
haemosporidian parasites are reported and compared to those of simian and rodent 
Plasmodium species.
METHODS: Almost the entire 18S rDNAs of avian haemosporidians belonging to the
genera Plasmodium (7), Haemoproteus (9), and Leucocytozoon (16) were obtained by 
PCR, molecular cloning, and sequencing ten clones each. Phylogenetic trees were
calculated and sequence patterns were analysed and compared to those of simian
and rodent malaria species. A section of the mitochondrial CytB was also
sequenced.
RESULTS: Sequence patterns in most avian Plasmodium species were similar to those
in the mammalian parasites with most species featuring two distinct 18S rDNA
sequence clusters. Distinct 18S variants were also found in Haemoproteus
tartakovskyi and the three Leucocytozoon species, whereas the other species
featured sets of similar haplotypes. The 18S rDNA GC-contents of the
Leucocytozoon toddi complex and the subgenus Parahaemoproteus were extremely high
with 49.3% and 44.9%, respectively. The 18S sequences of several species from all
three genera showed chimeric features, thus indicating recombination.
CONCLUSION: Gene duplication events leading to two diverged main sequence
clusters happened independently in at least six out of seven avian Plasmodium
species, thus supporting evolution according to a birth-and-death model like
proposed for the ribosomal units of simian and rodent Plasmodium species.
Patterns were similar in the 18S rDNAs of the Leucocytozoon toddi complex and
Haemoproteus tartakovskyi. However, the 18S rDNAs of the other species seem to
evolve in concerted fashion like in most eukaryotes, but the presence of chimeric
variants indicates that the ribosomal units rather evolve in a semi-concerted
manner. The new data may provide a basis for studies testing whether differential
expression of distinct 18S rDNA also occurs in avian Plasmodium species and
related haemosporidian parasites.
