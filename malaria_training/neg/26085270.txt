There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat malaria, with broad therapeutic
potential and novel modes of action, to widen the scope of treatment and to
overcome emerging drug resistance. Here we describe the discovery of DDD107498, a
compound with a potent and novel spectrum of antimalarial activity against
multiple life-cycle stages of the Plasmodium parasite, with good pharmacokinetic 
properties and an acceptable safety profile. DDD107498 demonstrates potential to 
address a variety of clinical needs, including single-dose treatment,
transmission blocking and chemoprotection. DDD107498 was developed from a
screening programme against blood-stage malaria parasites; its molecular target
has been identified as translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is
responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along messenger
RNA, and is essential for protein synthesis. This discovery of eEF2 as a viable
antimalarial drug target opens up new possibilities for drug discovery.
