Possessing a system that experimentally controls gene expression has been a Holy 
Grail in molecular malaria research. Several strategies to control gene
expression at different levels have been developed; the controlled step can range
from transcription initiation to post-translational modification and/or protein
degradation. Strategies successfully developed in model organisms and adapted to 
the malaria parasite can be classified into four categories aimed at the
conditional control of (i) gene deletion, (ii) gene transcription, (iii) mRNA
translation, and (iv) protein stability. Here, I intend to describe the various
strategies available and compare and contrast their advantages and limitations.
In the absence of a unique, ubiquitous solution, it is instrumental to utilize a 
variety of approaches that can respond to the particular needs of each gene.
