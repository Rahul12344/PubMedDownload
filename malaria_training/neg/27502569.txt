A number of studies have shown that CD8+ T cells mediate protective anti-malaria 
immunity in a mouse model. However, whether human CD8+ T cells play a role in
protection against malaria remains unknown. We recently established human immune 
system (HIS) mice harboring functional human CD8+ T cells (HIS-CD8 mice) by
transduction with HLA-A∗0201 and certain human cytokines using recombinant
adeno-associated virus-based gene transfer technologies. These HIS-CD8 mice mount
a potent, antigen-specific HLA-A∗0201-restricted human CD8+ T-cell response upon 
immunization with a recombinant adenovirus expressing a human malaria antigen,
the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), termed AdPfCSP. In
the present study, we challenged AdPfCSP-immunized HIS-CD8 mice with transgenic
Plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing full-length PfCSP and found that
AdPfCSP-immunized (but not naïve) mice were protected against subsequent malaria 
challenge. The level of the HLA-A∗0201-restricted, PfCSP-specific human CD8+
T-cell response was closely correlated with the level of malaria protection.
Furthermore, depletion of human CD8+ T cells from AdPfCSP-immunized HIS-CD8 mice 
almost completely abolished the anti-malaria immune response. Taken together, our
data show that human CD8+ T cells mediate protective anti-malaria immunity in
vivo.
