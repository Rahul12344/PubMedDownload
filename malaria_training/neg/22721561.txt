Using the Anopheles gambiae Giles genome as a template, we designed, screened and
identified 14 novel Exon-Primed Intron-Crossing (EPIC) PCR primer pairs for
Anopheles pseudopunctipennis Theobald 1901, a major vector of human Plasmodium
sp. in South America. These primers were designed to target the conserved regions
flanking consecutive exons of different genes and enabled the amplification of 17
loci of which nine were polymorphic. Polymorphisms at these loci ranged from two 
to four alleles. Intron length polymorphism analysis is a useful tool, which will
allow the study of the population structure of this mosquito species, which
remains poorly understood.
