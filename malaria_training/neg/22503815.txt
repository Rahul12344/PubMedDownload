Investigations into the genetic basis underlying antigenic variation in malaria
parasites have primarily described transcriptional regulation of the large,
multi-copy gene families that encode red cell surface antigens. In particular,
extensive alterations to chromatin structure and subnuclear localization have
been shown to play key roles in mutually exclusive expression, gene silencing and
activation, and epigenetic memory. However the mechanisms responsible for the
generation of sequence diversity within these gene families, a characteristic
that is equally important for a parasite's ability to avoid the host's immune
response, remains poorly understood in malaria. Recent work in model organisms
suggests that the mechanisms controlling gene activation and silencing might also
contribute to preferential recombination between antigen encoding genes, thus
linking these two key processes.
