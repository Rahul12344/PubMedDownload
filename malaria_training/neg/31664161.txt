Cyclooxygenase-2 [(COX-2) or prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 synthase-2 (PTGS-2)]
induces the production of prostaglandins as part of the host-immune response to
infections. Although a number of studies have demonstrated the effects of COX-2
promoter variants on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, their role in malaria 
remains undefined. As such, we investigated the relationship between four COX-2
promoter variants (COX-2 -512 C > T, -608 T > C, -765 G > C, and -1195 A > G) and
susceptibility to malaria and severe malarial anemia (SMA) upon enrollment and
longitudinally over a 36-month follow-up period. All-cause mortality was also
explored. The investigation was carried out in children (n = 1081, age; 2-70
months) residing in a holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission region of
western Kenya. At enrollment, genotypes/haplotypes (controlling for
anemia-promoting covariates) did not reveal any strong effects on susceptibility 
to either malaria or SMA. Longitudinal analyses showed decreased malaria episodes
in children who inherited the -608 CC mutant allele (RR = 0.746,
P = 1.811 × 10-4) and -512C/-608T/-765G/-1195G (CTGG) haplotype (RR = 0.856,
P = 0.011), and increased risk in TTCA haplotype carriers (RR = 1.115,
P = 0.026). Over the follow-up period, inheritance of the rare TTCG haplotype was
associated with enhanced susceptibility to both malaria (RR = 1.608, P = 0.016)
and SMA (RR = 5.714, P = 0.004), while carriage of the rare TTGG haplotype
increased the risk of malaria (RR = 1.755, P = 0.007), SMA (RR = 8.706,
P = 3.97 × 10-4), and all-cause mortality (HR = 110.000, P = 0.001).
Collectively, these results show that SNP variations in the COX-2 promoter, and
their inherited combinations, are associated with the longitudinal risk of
malaria, SMA, and all-cause mortality among children living in a high
transmission area for P. falciparum.
