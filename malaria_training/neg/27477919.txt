Cerebral malaria is the deadliest complication of Plasmodium falciparum
infection. Its pathophysiology is associated with a strong pro-inflammatory
reaction and the activation of glial cells. Among modulators released during the 
infection, heme seems to play a controversial role in the pathophysiology of
malaria. Herein, we first investigated the phenotype of glial cells during
cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. Given the fact
that high levels of heme were associated with cerebral malaria, we then
investigated its impact on microglial, astrocyte, and T cell responses to further
clarify its contribution in the neuropathophysiology. Surprisingly, we found that
administration of heme twice a day from day three of infection induced the
expression of the Heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) gene and prevented brain damages. More
specifically, heme inhibited the M1 phenotype of microglia, hampered the
activation of astrocytes, and decreased the cerebral expression of Ifng, Tnfa and
Ip10. Heme might that way alter the migration of pathogenic CD4 and CD8 T
lymphocytes within the brain observed during cerebral malaria. Taking into
account that cerebral malaria results from a complex interplay between host- and 
parasite-derived factors, it is possible that genetic polymorphisms of Hmox1,
which could be associated with the control of systemic levels of heme during P.
falciparum infection, might explain its dual role and its contribution to the
resistance to cerebral malaria.
