The preponderant clonal evolution hypothesis (PCE) predicts that frequent clonal 
reproduction (sex between two clones) in many pathogens capable of sexual
recombination results in strong linkage disequilibrium and the presence of
discrete genetic subdivisions characterized by occasional gene flow. We expand on
the PCE and predict that higher rates of clonal reproduction will result in: (1) 
morphologically cryptic species that exhibit (2) low within-species variation and
(3) recent between-species divergence. We tested these predictions in the
Caribbean lizard malaria parasite Plasmodium floridense using 63 single-infection
samples in lizards collected from across the parasite's range, and sequenced them
at two mitochondrial, one apicoplast, and five nuclear genes. We identified 11
provisionally cryptic species within P. floridense, each of which exhibits low
intraspecific variation and recent divergence times between species (some
diverged approximately 110,000 years ago). Our results are consistent with the
hypothesis that clonal reproduction can profoundly affect diversification of
species capable of sexual recombination, and suggest that clonal reproduction may
have led to a large number of unrecognized pathogen species. The factors that may
influence the rates of clonal reproduction among pathogens are unclear, and we
discuss how prevalence and virulence may relate to clonal reproduction.
