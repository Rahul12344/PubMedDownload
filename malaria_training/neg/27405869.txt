BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is a well-recognized risk of
receiving blood transfusions, and has occurred with Plasmodium falciparum,
Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. The simian parasite 
Plasmodium knowlesi is also known to be transmissible through inoculation of
infected blood, and this species is now the most common cause of malaria in
Malaysia with a high rate of severity and fatal cases reported. No confirmed case
of accidental transfusion-transmitted P. knowlesi has yet been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year old splenectomized patient with beta thalassaemia
major presented with fever 11 days after receiving a blood transfusion from a
pre-symptomatic donor who presented with knowlesi malaria 12 days following blood
donation. The infection resulted in severe disease in the recipient, with a
parasite count of 84,000/µL and associated metabolic acidosis and multi-organ
failure. She was treated with intravenous artesunate and made a good recovery.
Sequencing of a highly diverse 649-base pair fragment of the P. knowlesi
bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene (pkdhfr) revealed 
that the recipient and donor shared the same haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that acquisition of P. knowlesi from blood
transfusion can occur, and that clinical consequences can be severe. Furthermore,
this case raises the possibility that thalassaemic patients, particularly those
who are splenectomized, may represent a high-risk group for TTM and severe
malaria. With rising P. knowlesi incidence, further studies in Sabah are required
to determine the risk of TTM in order to guide screening strategies for blood
transfusion services.
