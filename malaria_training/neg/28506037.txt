Variant surface antigens (VSAs) encoded by pir families are considered to be the 
key proteins used by many Plasmodium spp. to escape the host immune system by
antigenic variation. This attribute of VSAs is a critical issue in the
development of a novel vaccine. In this regard, a population genetic study of vir
genes from Plasmodium vivax was performed in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Eighty-five venous blood samples and 4 of the vir genes, namely vir 27, vir 21,
vir 12, and vir 4, were selected for study. The number of segregating sites (S), 
number of haplotypes (H), haplotype diversity (Hd), DNA diversity (π and Θw), and
Tajima's D test value were conducted. Phylogenetic trees of each gene were
constructed. The vir 21 (S=143, H=22, Hd=0.827) was the most genetically diverse 
gene, and the vir 4 (S=6, H=4, Hd=0.556) was the opposite one. Tajima's D values 
for vir 27 (1.08530, P>0.1), vir 12 (2.89007, P<0.01), and vir 21 (0.40782,
P>0.1) were positive, and that of vir 4 (-1.32162, P>0.1) was negative. All
phylogenetic trees showed 2 clades with no particular branching according to the 
geographical differences and cluster. This study is the first survey on the vir
genes in ROK, providing information on the genetic level. The sample sequences
from vir 4 showed a clear difference to the Sal-1 reference gene sequence,
whereas they were very similar to those from Indian isolates.
