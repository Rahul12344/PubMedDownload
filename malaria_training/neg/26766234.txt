Mosquito species that specialize in biting humans are few but dangerous. They
include the African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, as 
well as Aedes aegypti, the cosmopolitan vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow
fever. These mosquitoes have evolved a remarkable innate preference for human
odor that helps them find and bite us. Here I review what is known about this
important evolutionary adaptation, from its historical documentation to its
chemical and molecular basis.
