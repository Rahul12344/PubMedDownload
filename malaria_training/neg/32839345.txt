A Cas9/guide RNA-based gene drive strain, AgNosCd-1, was developed to deliver
antiparasite effector molecules to the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae
The drive system targets the cardinal gene ortholog producing a red-eye
phenotype. Drive can achieve 98 to 100% in both sexes and full introduction was
observed in small cage trials within 6 to 10 generations following a single
release of gene-drive males. No genetic load resulting from the integrated
transgenes impaired drive performance in the trials. Potential drive-resistant
target-site alleles arise at a frequency <0.1, and five of the most prevalent
polymorphisms in the guide RNA target site in collections of colonized and
wild-derived African mosquitoes do not prevent cleavage in vitro by the
Cas9/guide RNA complex. Only one predicted off-target site is cleavable in vitro,
with negligible deletions observed in vivo. AgNosCd-1 meets key performance
criteria of a target product profile and can be a valuable component of a
field-ready strain for mosquito population modification to control malaria
transmission.
