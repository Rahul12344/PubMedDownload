BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria species in Brazil. The
parasite-host coevolutionary process can be viewed as an 'arms race', in which
adaptive genetic changes in one are eventually matched by alterations in the
other.
METHODS: Following the candidate gene approach we analyzed the CD40, CD40L and
BLYS genes that participate in B-cell co-stimulation, for associations with P.
vivax malaria. The study sample included 97 patients and 103 controls. We
extracted DNA using the extraction and purification commercial kit and identified
the following SNPs: -1C > T in the CD40 gene, -726T > C in the CD40L gene and the
-871C > T in the BLyS gene using PCR-RFLP. We analyzed the genotype and allele
frequencies by direct counting. We also compared the observed with the expected
genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies for these SNPs did not differ
statistically between patient and control groups. Gene-gene interactions were not
observed between the CD40 and BLYS and between the CD40L and BLYS genes. Overall,
the genes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Significant differences were not
observed among the frequencies of antibody responses against P. vivax sporozoite 
and erythrocytic antigens and the CD40 and BLYS genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that, although the investigated CD40,
CD40L and BLYS alleles differ functionally, this variation does not alter the
functionality of the molecules in a way that would interfere in susceptibility to
the disease. The variants of these genes may influence the clinical course rather
than simply increase or decrease susceptibility.
