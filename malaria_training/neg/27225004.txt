Plasmodium parasites have two actin isoforms. Actin I is ubiquitously expressed, 
while the second actin isoform is expressed in the sexual stages and ookinetes.
Reverse genetic analysis revealed two phenotypes in parasites lacking the
protein: a block in male gametogenesis (exflagellation) and a second phenotype in
oocyst development, dependent upon the expression of the gene in female
gametocytes. Here, we report that the genetic complementation of two independent 
mutants lacking actin II does not fully restore wild-type function. Constructs
were integrated in the c-rrna locus, previously used for expression of
transgenes, in order to determine the dependence of expression on actin II
flanking genomic regions. Partial restoration of male gametogenesis was achieved 
when the transgene contained, in addition to the coding region, 1.2 kb upstream
of the actin II open reading frame. Another transgene, which comprised 2.7 kb of 
actin II 5' flanking regions and the cognate 3' downstream sequence, fully
restored exflagellation. However, in both complemented strains, oocyst
development was severely impaired compared to the WT. These data suggest that
male gametocyte expression of actin II is dependent upon extensive flanking
regions, while female expression requires even longer genomic sequences for
correct expression of the gene.
