Cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmer's itch, is an allergenic skin
reaction followed by intense itching caused by schistosome cercariae penetrating 
human skin. Cercarial dermatitis outbreaks occur globally and are frequently
associated with freshwater lakes and are occasionally associated with marine or
estuarine waters where birds reside year-round or where migratory birds reside.
In this study, a broadly reactive TaqMan assay targeting 18S rRNA gene (ribosomal
DNA [rDNA]) sequences that was based on a genetically diverse panel of
schistosome isolates representing 13 genera and 20 species (the 18S rDNA TaqMan
assay) was developed. A PCR assay was also developed to amplify a 28S rDNA region
for subsequent sequencing to identify schistosomes. When applied to surface water
samples seeded with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, the 18S rDNA TaqMan assay
enabled detection at a level of 5 S. mansoni cercariae in 100 liters of lake
water. The 18S rDNA TaqMan and 28S rDNA PCR sequencing assays were also applied
to 100-liter water samples collected from lakes in Nebraska and Wisconsin where
there were reported dermatitis outbreaks. Avian schistosome DNA was detected in
11 of 34 lake water samples using the TaqMan assay. Further 28S rDNA sequence
analysis of positive samples confirmed the presence of avian schistosome DNA and 
provided a preliminary identification of the avian schistosomes in 10 of the 11
samples. These data indicate that the broadly schistosome-reactive TaqMan assay
can be effective for rapid screening of large-volume water samples for detection 
of avian schistosomes, thereby facilitating timely response actions to mitigate
or prevent dermatitis outbreaks. Additionally, samples positive by the 18S rDNA
TaqMan assay can be further assayed using the 28S rDNA sequencing assay to both
confirm the presence of schistosomes and contribute to their identification.
