Systems biology approaches that are based on gene expression and bioinformatics
analysis have been successful in predicting the functions of many genes in
Plasmodium falciparum, a protozoan parasite responsible for most of the deaths
due to malaria. However, approaches that can provide information about the
biological processes that are active in this parasite in vivo during complicated 
malaria conditions have been scarcely deployed. Here we report the analysis of a 
weighted gene co-expression based network for P. falciparum, from non-cerebral
clinical complications. Gene expression profiles of 20 P. falciparum clinical
isolates were utilized to construct the same. A total of 20 highly interacting
modules were identified post network creation. In 12 of these modules, at least
10% of the member genes, were found to be differentially regulated in parasites
from patient isolates showing complications, when compared with those from
patients with uncomplicated disease. Enrichment analysis helped identify
biological processes like oxidation-reduction, electron transport chain, protein 
synthesis, ubiquitin dependent catabolic processes, RNA binding and purine
nucleotide metabolic processes as associated with these modules. Additionally,
for each module, highly connected hub genes were identified. Detailed functional 
analysis of many of these, which have known annotated functions underline their
importance in parasite development and survival. This suggests, that other hub
genes with unknown functions may also be playing crucial roles in parasite
biology, and, are potential candidates for intervention strategies.
