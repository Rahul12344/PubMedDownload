Background: Today, the use of maggot therapy has become widespread due to the
increase in chronic ulcers in the world. The recombinant production of secreted
enzymes from these larvae is a novel non-invasive method for the treatment of
chronic ulcers. Lucilia Sericata (L. sericata) collagenase (MMP-1) has been
expressed in insect cells. Collagenase is an enzyme that is widely used in
clinical therapy and industry. It has been indicated that collagenase is
expressed and secreted in salivary glands of L. sericata while using for maggot
debridement therapy.
Objectives: In the present study we decided to produce the recombinant form of
collagenase enzyme in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) insect cells using the
baculovirus expression system (Bac-to-Bac).
Materials and Methods: cloned the coding sequences (residues 494-1705) of L.
sericata collagenase into the pFastBacHTA as donor plasmid. After transposition
in the bacmid of DH10Bac host, the bacmid was transfected into the Sf9 cell line,
then the expressed recombinant collagenase (MMP-1) was purified using the Ni-NTA 
agarose.
Results: The recombinant protein was verified by Western blotting. Furthermore,
the biological activity of purified protein was measured in the presence of its
specific substrate and its inhibitor, which was 67 IU.mL-1 based on our results, 
it was revealed that the characterized gene in our previous study codes L.
sericata collagenesa enzyme.
Conclusion: Considering to the broad applications of collagenase in medical
sciences, for the first time, we cloned the L. sericata collagenase (MMP-1) gene 
into the insect cell line to establish a method for the expression and
purification of L. sericata collagenase (MMP-1). The result help for preparing
and designing a safe and versatile recombinant drug in future.
