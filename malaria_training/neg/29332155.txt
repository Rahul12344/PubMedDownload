Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended drug for intermittent
preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in most of sub-Saharan Africa.
Resistance to SP is related to mutations in the dhfr and dhps gene of Plasmodium 
falciparum. This study determined the prevalence of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps
polymorphisms found in asymptomatic pregnant women attending antenatal care in
Calabar, Nigeria. From October 2013 to November 2014, asymptomatic pregnant women
attending antenatal care clinics were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. 
Malaria diagnosis testing was done using thick and thin smears. Dried blood spot 
filter papers were collected. Parasite DNA was extracted from the filter papers
using a chelex extraction. Extraction was followed by nested PCR and restriction 
enzyme digestion. P. falciparum infection was detected by microscopy in 7%
(32/459) participants. Twenty-eight P. falciparum isolates were successfully
genotyped. In the Pfdhfr gene, the triple mutation was almost fixed; S108N
mutation was (100%), N51I (93%) and C59R mutations (93%), whereas the I164L
mutation was absent. The prevalence of Pfdhps S436A, A437G, A581G and A613S
mutations was 82.1% (23/28), 96.4% (27/28), 71.4% (20/28) and 71.4% (20/28)
respectively. The K540E mutation was absent. The prevalence of the Pfdhfr triple 
mutation IRNI was 92.9% (26/28). The efficacy of SP as IPTp in Southeast Nigeria 
may be severely threatened. The continuous monitoring of SP molecular markers of 
resistance is required to assess thresholds. The evaluation of alternative
preventive treatment strategies and drug options for preventing malaria in
pregnancy may be necessary.
