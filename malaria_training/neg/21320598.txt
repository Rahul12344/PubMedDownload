Previous studies showed that Anopheles gambiae L3-5 females, which are refractory
(R) to Plasmodium infection, express higher levels of genes involved in
redox-metabolism and mitochondrial respiration than susceptible (S) G3 females.
Our studies revealed that R females have reduced longevity, faster utilization of
lipid reserves, impaired mitochondrial state-3 respiration, increased rate of
mitochondrial electron leak and higher expression levels of several glycolytic
enzyme genes. Furthermore, when state-3 respiration was reduced in S females by
silencing expression of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), hydrogen
peroxide generation was higher and the mRNA levels of lactate dehydrogenase
increased in the midgut, while the prevalence and intensity of Plasmodium berghei
infection were significantly reduced. We conclude that there are broad metabolic 
differences between R and S An. gambiae mosquitoes that influence their
susceptibility to Plasmodium infection.
