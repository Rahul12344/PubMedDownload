Background & objectives: : Insecticide applied at optimum dosage and coverage
delays the development of resistance in disease vectors. The study was aimed to
test the hypothesis whether decrease in exposure to insecticide leads to decrease
in selection of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were
variably exposed to insecticide in the laboratory by simulating the variations in
insecticide sprays applied in the field.
Methods: : The study was carried out on DDT resistant adults of Anopheles
stephensi. Mosquitoes were differentially exposed to impregnated papers of DDT
(4%), that were differentially masked to 25, 50, and 75% area with an
unimpregnated Whatman No.1 filter paper, and to a positive control without any
masking, i.e. 100% exposure area. The study was conducted for five generations
and at each generation mosquitoes were exposed to differentially masked
impregnated papers, and percent mortality was calculated.
Results: : The observed survival rate in differential exposures was more with the
increase in heterozygous genotype resistance-susuceptible (RS) frequency.
Resistant gene frequency with differential exposures (25 to 75%) was in the range
of 0.38-0.54 for the F0 generation, which increased to 0.84-0.93 for the F4
generation. In 100% exposure it was 0.18 in F0 generation, which increased to
0.58 in the F4 generation. The resistant gene frequencies in the population
showed increasing trend with decrease in exposure in contrast to complete
exposure.
Interpretation & conclusion: : Variable simulated exposures resulted in
precipitation of increased resistance while complete exposure resulted in lower
levels of resistance, signifying the importance of optimum dosage and coverage in
the indoor residual spray in delaying/avoiding the development of insecticide
resistance in the disease vectors.
