Trichomes, small protrusions on the surface of many plant species, can produce
and store various secondary metabolic products. Artemisinin, the most famous and 
potent medicine for malaria, is synthesized, stored, and secreted by Artemisia
annua trichomes. However, the molecular basis regulating the biosynthesis of
artemisinin and the development of trichomes in A. annua remains poorly
understood. Here, we report that an AP2 transcription factor, TRICHOME AND
ARTEMISININ REGULATOR 1 (TAR1), plays crucial roles in regulating the development
of trichomes and the biosynthesis of artemisinin in A. annua. TAR1, which encodes
a protein specially located in the nucleus, is mainly expressed in young leaves, 
flower buds, and some trichomes. In TAR1-RNAi lines, the morphology of trichomes 
and the composition of cuticular wax were altered, and the artemisinin content
was dramatically reduced, which could be significantly increased by TAR1
oeverexpression. Expression levels of several key genes that are involved in
artemisinin biosynthesis were altered when TAR1 was silenced or overexpressed. By
the electrophoretic mobility shift, yeast one-hybrid and transient transformation
β-glucuronidase assays, we showed that ADS and CYP71AV1, two key genes in the
biosynthesis pathway of artemisinin, are likely the direct targets of TAR1. Taken
together, our results indicate that TAR1 is a key component of the molecular
network regulating trichome development and artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua.
