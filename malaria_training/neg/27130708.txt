The development of an effective malaria vaccine has remained elusive even until
today. This is because of our incomplete understanding of the immune mechanisms
that confer and/or correlate with protection. Human volunteers have been
protected experimentally from a subsequent challenge by immunization with
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites under drug cover. Here, we demonstrate that
sera from the protected individuals contain neutralizing antibodies against the
pre-erythrocytic stage. To identify the antigen(s) recognized by these
antibodies, a newly developed library of P. falciparum antigens was screened with
the neutralizing sera. Antibodies from protected individuals recognized a broad
antigenic repertoire of which three antigens, PfMAEBL, PfTRAP and PfSEA1 were
recognized by most protected individuals. As a proof of principle, we
demonstrated that anti-PfMAEBL antibodies block liver stage development in human 
hepatocytes. Thus, these antigens identified are promising targets for vaccine
development against malaria.
