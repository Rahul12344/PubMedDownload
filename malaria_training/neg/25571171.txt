The effects of cell asynchrony on time-series data: an analysis on gene
expression level of Plasmodium falciparum.

Zhao W, Dauwels J, Cao J.

To investigate the intraerythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, time-series 
gene expression data are measured of infected red blood cells. However, the
observed data is blurred due to cell asynchrony during experiments. In this
paper, the effects of cell asynchrony are investigated by conducting numerical
experiments. The simulation results suggest that cell asynchrony has varying
effects on different intrinsic expression patterns. Specifically, the intrinsic
patterns with high expression around the late life stage are more likely to be
affected by cell asynchrony. It is also investigated how the effects of cell
asynchrony are influenced by the experimental conditions. Certain parameters are 
identified that have a strong effects on cell asynchrony, and these parameters
should be measured during biological experiments in order to deblur time-series
gene expression data.
