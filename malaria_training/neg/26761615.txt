We have developed a convenient, robust and low-cost RNA detection system suitable
for high-throughput applications. This system uses a highly specific sandwich
hybridization to capture target RNA directly onto solid support, followed by
on-site signal amplification via 2-dimensional, branched hybridizing chain
polymerization through toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. The assay
uses SYBR Green to detect targets at concentrations as low as 1 pM, without
involving nucleic acid purification or any enzymatic reaction, using ordinary
oligonucleotides without modification or labeling. The system was demonstrated in
the detection of malaria RNA in blood and GAPDH gene expression in cell lysate.
