BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic falciparum and non-falciparum malaria infections are
major challenges to malaria control interventions, as they remain a source of
continual infection in the community. This becomes even more important as the
debate moves towards elimination and eradication. This study sought to quantify
the burden of Plasmodium malaria infection in seven communities in the Eastern
Region of Ghana.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study recruited 729 participants aged 85 years old
and below from 7 closely linked communities. Finger pricked blood was used to
prepare thick and thin blood smears as well as spot filter paper and an histidine
rich protein 2 (HRP2) rapid diagnostic test kit (RDT). Genomic DNA was extracted 
from the filter paper dry blood spot (DBS) and used in PCR to amplify the
Plasmodium 18S rRNA gene using species specific PCR.
RESULTS: 96.6% of the participants were identified as afebrile, with axillary
temperatures below 37.5 °C. PCR identified 66% of the participants to harbor
malaria parasites, with 9 P. malariae and 7 P. ovale mono-infections accounting
for 2.2% and P. falciparum combined with either 36 P. malariae or 25 P. ovale
infections, accounting for 13.3%. Parasite prevalence by microscopy (32%) was
similar to the RDT positivity rate (33%). False positive RDT results ranged from 
64.6% in children aged between 5 and 9 years to 10% in adults aged 20 years and
above. No significant differences were observed in falciparum and non-falciparum 
parasite carriage at the community level, however young adults aged between 15
and 19 years had the highest prevalence (34.8% (16/46)) of P. falciparum and P.
malariae parasite carriage whilst children aged between 5 and 9 years had the
highest level (11.4% (14/123)) of P. ovale carriage.
CONCLUSION: The high rate of misidentification of non-falciparum parasites and
the total absence of detection of P. ovale by microscopy suggests that more
sensitive malaria diagnostic tools including molecular assays are required to
accurately determine the prevalence of carriers of non-falciparum parasites and
low density P. falciparum infections, especially during national surveillance
exercises. Additionally, malaria control interventions targeting the
non-falciparum species P. malariae and P. ovale parasites are needed.
