Myxosporeans are best known for the diseases they cause in commercially important
fish species. Identification of myxosporeans at the species-level is mainly based
on conventional methods. The 18S rRNA gene sequence of morphologically identified
Myxobolus orissae infecting the gill lamellae of mrigal carp Cirrhinus mrigala
was characterized in the present study. The plasmodia of M.orissae were small,
elongated and white to pale in colour. Phylogenetically, the 18S rDNA nucleotide 
sequence of M.orissae was clustered with other gill-infecting Myxobolus spp. of
cyprinids. The species closely related to M. orissae was M. koi (FJ841887)
infecting the gill lamellae of Cyprinus carpio with 96% similarity. The carp
fin-infecting Thelohanelluscaudatus (KC865607) from India exhibited only 78% DNA 
sequence similarity with M. orissae. Low level of M. orissae infection on gill
caused thickening of epithelial cells surrounding the plasmodium. Under stressful
conditions, it is likely that such infection can easily spread in confined fish
and may cause serious disease outbreaks and economical losses.
