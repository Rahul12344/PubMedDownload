Vector control strategies based on population modification of Anopheline
mosquitoes may have a significant role in the malaria eradication agenda. They
could consolidate elimination gains by providing barriers to the reintroduction
of parasites and competent vectors, and allow resources to be allocated to new
control sites while maintaining treated areas free of malaria. Synthetic
biological approaches are being used to generate transgenic mosquitoes for
population modification. Proofs-of-principle exist for mosquito transgenesis, the
construction of anti-parasite effector genes and gene-drive systems for rapidly
introgressing beneficial genes into wild populations. Key challenges now are to
develop field-ready strains of mosquitoes that incorporate features that maximize
safety and efficacy, and specify pathways from discovery to development. We
propose three pathways and a framework for target product profiles that maximize 
safety and efficacy while meeting the demands of the complexity of malaria
transmission, and the regulatory and social diversity of potential end-users and 
stakeholders.
