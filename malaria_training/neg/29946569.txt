Amodiaquine resistance in Plasmodium berghei is associated with PbCRT His95Pro
mutation, loss of chloroquine, artemisinin and primaquine sensitivity, and high
transcript levels of key transporters.

Background: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has evolved complex 
drug evasion mechanisms to all available antimalarials. To date, the combination 
of amodiaquine-artesunate is among the drug of choice for treatment of
uncomplicated malaria. In this combination, a short acting, artesunate is
partnered with long acting, amodiaquine for which resistance may emerge rapidly
especially in high transmission settings. Here, we used a rodent malaria parasite
Plasmodium berghei ANKA as a surrogate of P. falciparum to investigate the
mechanisms of amodiaquine resistance. Methods: We used serial technique to select
amodiaquine resistance by submitting the parasites to continuous amodiaquine
pressure. We then employed the 4-Day Suppressive Test to monitor emergence of
resistance and determine the cross-resistance profiles. Finally, we genotyped the
resistant parasite by PCR amplification, sequencing and relative quantitation of 
mRNA transcript of targeted genes. Results: Submission of P. berghei ANKA to
amodiaquine pressure yielded resistant parasite within thirty-six passages. The
effective dosage that reduced 90% of parasitaemia (ED 90) of sensitive line and
resistant line were 4.29mg/kg and 19.13mg/kg, respectively. After freezing at
-80ÂºC for one month, the resistant parasite remained stable with an ED 90 of
18.22mg/kg. Amodiaquine resistant parasites are also resistant to chloroquine
(6fold), artemether (10fold), primaquine (5fold), piperaquine (2fold) and
lumefantrine (3fold). Sequence analysis of Plasmodium berghei chloroquine
resistant transporter revealed His95Pro mutation. No variation was identified in 
Plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance gene-1 (Pbmdr1), Plasmodium berghei
deubiquitinating enzyme-1 or Plasmodium berghei Kelch13 domain nucleotide
sequences. Amodiaquine resistance is also accompanied by high mRNA transcripts of
key transporters; Pbmdr1, V-type/H+ pumping pyrophosphatase-2 and sodium hydrogen
ion exchanger-1 and Ca 2+/H + antiporter. Conclusions: Selection of amodiaquine
resistance yielded stable "multidrug-resistant'' parasites and thus may be used
to study common resistance mechanisms associated with other antimalarial drugs.
Genome wide studies may elucidate other functionally important genes controlling 
AQ resistance in P. berghei.
