BACKGROUND: Piperaquine (PQ) is one of the major components of artemisinin-based 
combination therapy for malaria. However, the mechanism of PQ resistance has
remained unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we infected mice with PQ-resistant Plasmodium berghei
ANKA strain line (PbPQR) or PQ-sensitive P. berghei ANKA strain line (PbPQS) and 
their survival rates, parasitemia, and spleen sizes were compared. In addition,
we constructed genomic DNA subtractive library of spleens from the infected mice,
and screened the potential PQ-resistant related genes from genomic DNA of PbPQR
line using the representational difference analysis (RDA) method. Clones of the
subtractive library were screened by PCR, and related genes were sequenced and
analyzed using BLAST software of NCBI.
RESULTS: Compared to PbPQS-infected mice, PbPQR-infected mice survived
significantly longer, and had significantly lowered parasitemia rate and
significantly increased splenomegaly. Among the total of 502 clones picked, 494
were sequenced and 96 unique PCR fragments were obtained; in which 24 DNA
fragments were homologous to chromosomes related to immune function of mice. ORF 
Finder blasting showed that at the protein level, 26 encoded proteins were
homologous to 18 hypothetical PbANKA proteins and 13 encoded proteins were
homologous to "ferlin-like protein" family of PbANKA. In addition, there were
more immune-related DNA molecules, ubiquitous PbANKA homology at the ORF fragment
level, and enriched ferlin-like protein families identified from PbPQR-infected
mice than those from PbPQS-infected mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PbPQR may induce stronger protective
immune response than that of PbPQS in infected mice.
