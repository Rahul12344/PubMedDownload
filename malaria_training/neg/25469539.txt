β-Thalassemia is a genetic disease caused by a defect in the production of the
β-like globin chain. More than 200 known different variants can lead to the
disease and are mainly found in populations that have been exposed to malaria
parasites. We recently described a duplication of four nucleotides in the first
exon of β-globin gene in several families of patients living in
Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France). Using the genotypes at 12 microsatellite markers
surrounding the β-globin gene of four unrelated variant carriers plus an
additional one recently discovered, we found that they shared a common haplotype 
indicating a founder effect that was estimated to have taken place 225 years ago 
(nine generations). In order to determine whether this variant arose in this
region of Northern Europe or was introduced by migrants from regions of the world
where thalassemia is endemic, we genotyped the first 4 unrelated variant carriers
and 32 controls from Nord-Pas-de-Calais for 97 European ancestry informative
markers (EAIMs). Using these EAIMs and comparing with population reference
panels, we demonstrated that the variant carriers were very similar to the
controls and were closer to North European populations than to South European or 
Middle-East populations. Rare β-thalassemia variants have already been described 
in patients sampled in non-endemic regions, but it is the first proof of a
founder effect in Northern Europe.
