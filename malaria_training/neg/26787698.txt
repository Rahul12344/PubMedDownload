The discovery of new antimalarial drugs able to target both the asexual and
gametocyte stages ofPlasmodium falciparumis critical to the success of the
malaria eradication campaign. We have developed and validated a robust, rapid,
and cost-effective high-throughput reporter gene assay to identify compounds
active against late-stage (stage IV and V) gametocytes. The assay, which is
suitable for testing compound activity at incubation times up to 72 h,
demonstrates excellent quality and reproducibility, with averageZ' values of 0.85
± 0.01. We used the assay to screen more than 10,000 compounds from three
chemically diverse libraries. The screening outcomes highlighted the opportunity 
to use collections of compounds with known activity against the asexual stages of
the parasites as a starting point for gametocytocidal activity detection in order
to maximize the chances of identifying gametocytocidal compounds. This assay
extends the capabilities of our previously reported luciferase assay, which
tested compounds against early-stage gametocytes, and opens possibilities to
profile the activities of gametocytocidal compounds over the entire course of
gametocytogenesis.
