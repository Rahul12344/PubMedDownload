Prevalence of and risk factors associated with polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-determined Plasmodium falciparum positivity were assessed on day 3 after
initiation of treatment, pre-implementation and up to 8 years post-deployment of 
artemether-lumefantrine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in
Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Samples originated from previously reported trials
conducted between 2006 and 2014. Cytochrome b-nested PCR was used to detect
malaria parasites from blood samples collected on a filter paper on day 3.
Chi-square and McNemar chi-squared tests, logistic regression models, and
analysis of variance were used as appropriate. Primary outcome was based on the
proportion of patients with day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity.
Overall, 256/584 (43.8%) of screened patients had day 3 PCR-determined
positivity, whereas only 2/584 (0.3%) had microscopy-determined asexual
parasitemia. Day 3 PCR-determined positivity increased from 28.0% (14/50) in 2006
to 74.2% (132/178) in 2007-2008 and declined, thereafter, to 36.0% (50/139) in
2012-2013 and 27.6% (60/217) in 2014. When data were pooled, pretreatment
microscopy-determined asexual parasitemia ≥ 100,000/µL, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, age
< 5 years, temperature ≥ 37.5°C, and year of study 2007-2008 and 2012-2013 were
significantly associated with PCR-determined positivity on day 3. Significant
increases in P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 N86 and P. falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter K76 across years were not associated with
PCR-determined positivity on day 3. No statistically significant association was 
observed between day 3 PCR-determined positivity and PCR-adjusted recrudescence. 
Day 3 PCR-determined P. falciparum positivity remained common in patients treated
before and after implementation of artemether-lumefantrine in Bagamoyo district, 
Tanzania. However, its presence was associated with pretreatment characteristics.

NCT02090036.
