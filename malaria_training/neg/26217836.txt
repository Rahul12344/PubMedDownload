Plasmodium hoionucleophilum n. sp. was described from the Common Grasshopper
Warbler Locustella naevia based on the morphology of blood stages and partial
sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. This malaria parasite
belongs to the subgenus Novyella; it can be readily distinguished from all
described Novyella parasites due to two features, i. e. the strict adherence of
its meronts to the nuclei of infected erythrocytes and the lack of such adherence
in the case of gametocytes. We also found the lineage pLZFUS01 in Red-Backed
Shrike Lanius collurio, identified this parasite and conclude that it belongs to 
Plasiodium relictum. Illustrations of blood stages of these two parasites are
given. DNA lineages associated with P. hoionucleophilum (pSW2, GenBank KC342643) 
and P. relictum (pLZFUS01, GenBank KC342644) are reported and can be used for
molecular identification of these malarial infections. Phylogenetic analysis
determines DNA lineages closely related to both reported parasites and is in
accordance with the parasites' morphological identification. This study
contributes to barcoding of avian malaria parasites using partial sequences of
cyt b gene.
