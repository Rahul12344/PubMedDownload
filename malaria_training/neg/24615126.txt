Chloroquine (CQ) is used as a first-line therapy for the treatment of Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria in Nicaragua. We investigated the prevalence of molecular
markers associated with CQ and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance in P.
falciparum isolates obtained from the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of
Nicaragua. Blood spots for this study were made available from a CQ and SP drug
efficacy trial conducted in 2005 and also from a surveillance study performed in 
2011. Polymorphisms in P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter, dihydrofolate
reductase, and dihydropteroate synthase gene loci that are associated with
resistance to CQ, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine, respectively, were detected by 
DNA sequencing. In the 2005 dataset, only 2 of 53 isolates had a CQ resistance
allele (CVIET), 2 of 52 had a pyrimethamine resistance allele, and 1 of 49 had a 
sulfadoxine resistance allele. In the 2011 dataset, none of 45 isolates analyzed 
had CQ or SP resistance alleles.
