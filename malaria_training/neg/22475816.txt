We review the principles of linkage analysis of experimental genetic crosses and 
their application to Plasmodium falciparum. Three experimental genetic crosses
have been performed using the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Linkage
analysis of the progeny of these crosses has been used to identify parasite genes
important in phenotypes such as drug resistance, parasite growth and virulence,
and transmission to mosquitoes. The construction and analysis of genetic maps has
been used to characterise recombination rates across the parasite genome and to
identify hotspots of recombination.
