Transgenic reporter lines of malaria parasites that express fluorescent or
luminescent proteins are valuable tools for drug and vaccine screening assays as 
well as to interrogate parasite gene function. Different Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf ) reporter lines exist, however nearly all have been created in the African
NF54/3D7 laboratory strain. Here we describe the generation of novel reporter
lines, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene modification, both in the standard Pf NF54
background and in a recently described Cambodian P. falciparum NF135.C10 line.
Sporozoites of this line show more effective hepatocyte invasion and enhanced
liver merozoite development compared to Pf NF54. We first generated Pf NF54
reporter parasites to analyze two novel promoters for constitutive and high
expression of mCherry-luciferase and GFP in blood and mosquito stages. The
promoter sequences were selected based on available transcriptome data and are
derived from two housekeeping genes, i.e., translation initiation factor SUI1,
putative (sui1, PF3D7_1243600) and 40S ribosomal protein S30 (40s,
PF3D7_0219200). We then generated and characterized reporter lines in the Pf
NF135.C10 line which express GFP driven by the sui1 and 40s promoters as well as 
by the previously used ef1α promoter (GFP@ef1α, GFP@sui1, GFP@40s). The GFP@40s
reporter line showed strongest GFP expression in liver stages as compared to the 
other two lines. The strength of reporter expression by the 40s promoter
throughout the complete life cycle, including liver stages, makes transgenic
lines expressing reporters by the 40s promoter valuable novel tools for analyses 
of P. falciparum.
