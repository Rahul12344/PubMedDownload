In this cross-sectional study, we investigated host genetic factors and ethnic
variation in circulating Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2
(msp-2) clones among children with asymptomatic malaria. Isolates from seventy
two asymptomatic malaria children were used for genotyping block 3 of msp-2 gene 
by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sickle cell trait and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency were analysed by restriction 
fragment length polymorphism of DNA products from PCR targeting codons 6 and 68
of the beta-globin (HBB) and G6PD genes respectively. ABO blood group was typed
by agglutination method. A total of forty two msp-2 genotypes (20 for 3D7 and 22 
for FC27) were detected for an average (standard error of mean) multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 2.45 (0.16). The MOI was statistically the same among the five
identified ethnic groups (P = 0.83). The overall prevalence of sickle cell trait 
and G6PD deficiency were 12.50 % and 22.22 % respectively. MOI was similar
between children with Hb AA and Hb AS genotypes (P = 0.42). MOI was significantly
high among children with a mutant G6PD genotype (P = 0.017). MOI was
significantly higher in blood group O than group A (P = 0.03). Our findings show 
that although ethnicity and sickle cell trait have no association with MOI, the
association was observed with G6PD genotype and ABO group. The results suggest
the need for extension and expansion of the current study in order to investigate
the mechanisms involved.
