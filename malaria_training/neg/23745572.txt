Host and Plasmodium interactions result in highly variable clinical phenotypes,
partly explained by the nature and level of anti-malarial antibody response.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G can create a tolerogenic environment, allowing
parasites to escape from anti-malarial immunity. We performed a family-based
association study encompassing 483 Sereer individuals (261 children and their
parents), and reported two independent signals at the HLA-G 3' untranslated
region associated with antibody response to specific Plasmodium falciparum blood 
stage antigens, previously associated with malaria protection: (i) +3010G
together with +3142C with total IgG and IgG1 against GLURP and (ii) +3196G with
IgG3 against MSP2. While these results require further investigation, they
suggest for the first time a role of HLA-G in the regulation of humoral immune
response in malaria.
