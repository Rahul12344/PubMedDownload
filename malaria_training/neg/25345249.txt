mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II gene in Indian populations.

The genetic differentiation in A. stephensi based on haplotype diversity using
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and bysequencing of CO II gene across
different localities in India has been analyzed. The presence of only one DraI
restriction site in CO II gene conferred to haplotype B indicating that the gene 
is very much conserved and the gene flow is not affected even by a major
geographical distance barrier. The sequencing and analysisof various population
parameters revealed seven haplotypes in all populations. The West Bengal
population was found to be more genetically diverse than others. The geographic
distance between populations was found to be contributing to the genetic
differentiation. The sign of demographic expansion were found in three of the
five populations. The local geographic barriers were found to be ineffective in
prevention of gene flow.
