BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods offer an
alternative to the light microscopy examination of mosquito salivary glands for
the determination of malaria sporozoite rates in wild caught female Anopheles.
Removal of mosquito abdomens is assumed to eliminate false positives caused by
malaria oocyst DNA in the midgut. This assumption has not been tested with
current gold standard PCR assays, and for the variety of conditions that
specimens could encounter in the laboratory and field.
METHODS: Laboratory Anopheles stephensi were used that had been infected with
Plasmodium falciparum 6-7 days and 14 days post infection (p.i.), when oocysts
only and oocysts + sporozoites, respectively, are developed. Mosquitoes were
killed and immediately frozen, air dried before being frozen, or stored under
humid conditions overnight before being frozen, to simulate a range of conditions
in the field. Additionally, abdomens were removed anterior to, at, or posterior
to the junction of the abdomen and thorax, and both portions were processed using
a standard nested PCR of the small sub-unit nuclear ribosomal genes (ssrDNA) with
products visualized on agarose gels.
RESULTS: Overall, 4.1 % (4/97) of head + thorax samples that were 6-7 days p.i.
gave apparent false positives for sporozoites, compared to 9.3 % (9/97) that were
positive for abdomens. No positives (0/52) were obtained when similar specimens
were bisected anterior to the junction of the thorax and abdomen, compared to
21.2 % (11/52) that were positive for posterior portions. Multiple bands were
noted for positives from the 'Frozen' treatment and the rate of false negatives
due to DNA degradation appears higher under the 'Humid' treatment.
Reproducibility of results for the 'Frozen' treatment was 90 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance of specimen condition and the bisection step 
in determining sporozoite rates, little attention has been paid to them in the
literature. Recommendations from this study are that: 1) care needs to be taken
to reduce DNA degradation in the field; 2) mosquito abdomens be separated
anterior to the junction of the thorax and abdomen; and 3) DNA sequencing of a
subsample of positive results should be undertaken if possible.
