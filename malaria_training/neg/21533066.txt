Transposon-mediated transformation was used to produce Anopheles stephensi that
express single-chain antibodies (scFvs) designed to target the human malaria
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The scFvs, m1C3, m4B7, and m2A10, are derived
from mouse monoclonal antibodies that inhibit either ookinete invasion of the
midgut or sporozoite invasion of salivary glands. The scFvs that target the
parasite surface, m4B7 and m2A10, were fused to an Anopheles gambiae
antimicrobial peptide, Cecropin A. Previously-characterized Anopheles cis-acting 
DNA regulatory elements were included in the transgenes to coordinate scFv
production with parasite development. Gene amplification and immunoblot analyses 
showed promoter-specific increases in transgene expression in blood-fed females. 
Transgenic mosquito lines expressing each of the scFv genes had significantly
lower infection levels than controls when challenged with P. falciparum.
