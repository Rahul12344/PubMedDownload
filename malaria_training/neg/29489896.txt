Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and commensal microbes mediate
pathogen infection outcomes in insect disease vectors. Although PGRP-LD is
retained in multiple vectors, its role in host defense remains elusive. Here we
report that Anopheles stephensi PGRP-LD protects the vector from malaria parasite
infection by regulating gut homeostasis. Specifically, knock down of PGRP-LD
(dsLD) increased susceptibility to Plasmodium berghei infection, decreased the
abundance of gut microbiota and changed their spatial distribution. This outcome 
resulted from a change in the structural integrity of the peritrophic matrix
(PM), which is a chitinous and proteinaceous barrier that lines the midgut lumen.
Reduction of microbiota in dsLD mosquitoes due to the upregulation of immune
effectors led to dysregulation of PM genes and PM fragmentation. Elimination of
gut microbiota in antibiotic treated mosquitoes (Abx) led to PM loss and
increased vectorial competence. Recolonization of Abx mosquitoes with indigenous 
Enterobacter sp. restored PM integrity and decreased mosquito vectorial capacity.
Silencing PGRP-LD in mosquitoes without PM didn't influence their vector
competence. Our results indicate that PGPR-LD protects the gut microbiota by
preventing hyper-immunity, which in turn promotes PM structurally integrity. The 
intact PM plays a key role in limiting P. berghei infection.
