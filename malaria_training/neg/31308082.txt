Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is an important
malaria virulence factor. The protein family can be divided into clinically
relevant subfamilies. ICAM-1-binding group A PfEMP1 proteins also bind
endothelial protein C receptor and have been associated with cerebral malaria in 
children. IgG to these PfEMP1 proteins is acquired later in life than that to
group A PfEMP1 not binding ICAM-1. The kinetics of acquisition of IgG to group B 
and C PfEMP1 proteins binding ICAM-1 is unclear and was studied here. Gene
sequences encoding group B and C PfEMP1 with DBLβ domains known to bind ICAM-1
were used to identify additional binders. Levels of IgG specific for DBLβ domains
from group A, B, and C PfEMP1 binding or not binding ICAM-1 were measured in
plasma from Ghanaian children with or without malaria. Seven new ICAM-1-binding
DBLβ domains from group B and C PfEMP1 were identified. Healthy children had
higher levels of IgG specific for ICAM-1-binding DBLβ domains from group A than
from groups B and C. However, the opposite pattern was found in children with
malaria, particularly among young patients. Acquisition of IgG specific for DBLβ 
domains binding ICAM-1 differs between PfEMP1 groups.
