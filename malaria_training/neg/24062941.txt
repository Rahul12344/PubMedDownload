Antigenic variation in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves 
sequential and mutually exclusive expression of members of the var multi-gene
family and appears to follow a non-random pattern. In this study, using a
detailed in vitro gene transcription analysis of the culture-adapted HB3 strain
of P. falciparum, we show that antigenic switching is governed by a global
activation hierarchy favouring short and highly diverse genes in central
chromosomal location. Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been
associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely
activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through
adhesion-dependent survival rates. We further show that a gene's activation rate 
is positively associated sequence diversity, which could offer important new
insights into the evolution and maintenance of antigenic diversity in P.
