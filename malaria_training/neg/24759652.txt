Haemoproteus ilanpapernai Karadjian and Landau n. sp. from the Spotted Wood Owl, 
Strix seloputo, in Singapore is described from material from Ilan Paperna's
collection of slides. The species was previously identified as Haemoproteus
syrnii (Mayer, 1910). However, comparisons between the material from Strix
seloputo and our own material from Strix aluco, the type host of H. syrnii,
revealed morphological and molecular differences. H. ilanpapernai n. sp. differs 
morphologically from H. syrnii by the much smaller size of the gametocytes, the
different position of the mature gametocytes in the erythrocyte (apical,
subapical, or lateral in H. ilanpapernai vs. always lateral in H. syrnii), the
effect on the erythrocyte nucleus (frequently tilted in H. ilanpapernai but not
displaced laterally vs. straight and displaced laterally in H. syrnii) and
characters of the pigment (aggregated in the gametocytes of H. ilanpapernai vs.
dispersed in H. syrnii). A molecular analysis showed that the two species differ 
by 2.9% at the cyt b and 3.1% at the COI genes.
