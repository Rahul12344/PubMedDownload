The Asia Pacific Leaders in Malaria Alliance (APLMA) have committed to eliminate 
malaria from the region by 2030. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has the highest malaria
burden in the Asia-Pacific region but with the intensification of control efforts
since 2005, transmission has been dramatically reduced and Plasmodium vivax is
now the dominant malaria infection in some parts of the country. To gain a better
understanding of the transmission dynamics and migration patterns of P. vivax in 
PNG, here we investigate population structure in eight geographically and
ecologically distinct regions of the country. A total of 219 P. vivax isolates
(16-30 per population) were successfully haplotyped using 10 microsatellite
markers. A wide range of genetic diversity (He=0.37-0.87, Rs=3.60-7.58) and
significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed in six of the
eight populations (IAS=0.08-0.15 p-value<0.05) reflecting a spectrum of
transmission intensities across the country. Genetic differentiation between
regions was evident (Jost's D=0.07-0.72), with increasing divergence of
populations with geographic distance. Overall, P. vivax isolates clustered into
three major genetic populations subdividing the Mainland lowland and coastal
regions, the Islands and the Highlands. P. vivax gene flow follows major human
migration routes, and there was higher gene flow amongst Mainland parasite
populations than among Island populations. The Central Province (samples
collected in villages close to the capital city, Port Moresby), acts as a sink
for imported infections from the three major endemic areas. These insights into
P. vivax transmission dynamics and population networks will inform targeted
strategies to contain malaria infections and to prevent the spread of drug
resistance in PNG.
