Antibodies to blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum play a pivotal role
in human immunity to malaria. During parasite development, multiple proteins are 
trafficked from the intracellular parasite to the surface of P.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs). However, the relative importance of
different proteins as targets of acquired antibodies, and key pathways involved
in trafficking major antigens remain to be clearly defined. We quantified
antibodies to surface antigens among children, adults, and pregnant women from
different malaria-exposed regions. We quantified the importance of antigens as
antibody targets using genetically engineered P. falciparum with modified surface
antigen expression. Genetic deletion of the trafficking protein skeleton-binding 
protein-1 (SBP1), which is involved in trafficking the surface antigen PfEMP1,
led to a dramatic reduction in antibody recognition of IEs and the ability of
human antibodies to promote opsonic phagocytosis of IEs, a key mechanism of
parasite clearance. The great majority of antibody epitopes on the IE surface
were SBP1-dependent. This was demonstrated using parasite isolates with different
genetic or phenotypic backgrounds, and among antibodies from children, adults,
and pregnant women in different populations. Comparisons of antibody reactivity
to parasite isolates with SBP1 deletion or inhibited PfEMP1 expression suggest
that PfEMP1 is the dominant target of acquired human antibodies, and that other
P. falciparum IE surface proteins are minor targets. These results establish SBP1
as part of a critical pathway for the trafficking of major surface antigens
targeted by human immunity, and have key implications for vaccine development,
and quantifying immunity in populations.
