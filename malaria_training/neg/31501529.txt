Genetic mapping and genome-wide studies provide evidence for the association of
several genetic polymorphisms with malaria, a complex pathological disease with
multiple severity degrees. We have previously described Berr1and Berr2 as
candidate genes identified in the WLA/Pas inbreed mouse strain predisposing to
resistance to cerebral malaria (CM) induced by P. berghei ANKA. We report in this
study the phenotypic and functional characteristics of a congenic strain we have 
derived for Berr2WLA allele on the C57BL/6JR (B6) background. B6.WLA-Berr2 was
found highly resistant to CM compared to C57BL/6JR susceptible mice. The
mechanisms associated with CM resistance were analyzed by combining genotype,
transcriptomic and immune response studies. We found that B6.WLA-Berr2 mice
showed a reduced parasite sequestration and blood-brain barrier disruption with
low CXCR3+ T cell infiltration in the brain along with altered glial cell
response upon P. berghei ANKA infection compared to B6. In addition, we have
identified the CD300f, belonging to a family of Ig-like encoding genes, as a
potential candidate associated with CM resistance. Microglia cells isolated from 
the brain of infected B6.WLA-Berr2 mice significantly expressed higher level of
CD300f compared to CMS mice and were associated with inhibition of inflammatory
response.
