Malaria is a life-threatening disease and one of the main causes of morbidity and
mortality in the human population. The disease also results in a major
socio-economic burden. The rapid spread of malaria epidemics in developing
countries is exacerbated by the rise in drug-resistant parasites and
insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. At present, malaria research is focused mainly 
on the development of drugs with increased therapeutic effects against Plasmodium
parasites. However, a vaccine against the disease is preferable over treatment to
achieve long-term control. Trials to develop a safe and effective immunization
protocol for the control of malaria have been occurring for decades, and continue
on today; still, no effective vaccines are available on the market. Recently,
peptide-based vaccines have become an attractive alternative approach. These
vaccines utilize short protein fragments to induce immune responses against
malaria parasites. Peptide-based vaccines are safer than traditional vaccines,
relatively inexpensive to produce, and can be composed of multiple T- and B-cell 
epitopes integrated into one antigenic formulation. Various combinations, based
on antigen choice, peptide epitope modification and delivery mechanism, have
resulted in numerous potential malaria vaccines candidates; these are presently
being studied in both preclinical and clinical trials. This review describes the 
current landscape of peptide-based vaccines, and addresses obstacles and
opportunities in the production of malaria vaccines.
