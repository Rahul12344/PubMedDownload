Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay for Identification of Five Human
Plasmodium Species in Malaysia.

Lau YL, Lai MY, Fong MY, Jelip J, Mahmud R.

The lack of rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostic tests represents the
primary hurdle affecting malaria surveillance in resource- and expertise-limited 
areas. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a sensitive, rapid, and
cheap diagnostic method. Five species-specific LAMP assays were developed based
on 18S rRNA gene. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP results were calculated as 
compared with microscopic examination and nested polymerase chain reaction. LAMP 
reactions were highly sensitive with the detection limit of one copy for
Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium malariae and 10 copies
for Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium ovale. LAMP positively detected all human 
malaria species in all positive samples (N = 134; sensitivity = 100%) within 35
minutes. All negative samples were not amplified by LAMP (N = 67; specificity =
100%). LAMP successfully detected two samples with very low parasitemia. LAMP may
offer a rapid, simple, and reliable test for the diagnosis of malaria in areas
where malaria is prevalent.
