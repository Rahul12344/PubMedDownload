Immune response (Ir) genes, originally proposed by Baruj Benacerraf to explain
differential antigen-specific responses in animal models, have become synonymous 
with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We discovered a non-MHC-linked
Ir gene in a T cell receptor (TCR) locus that was required for CD8+ T cell
responses to the Plasmodium berghei GAP5040-48 epitope in mice expressing the MHC
class I allele H-2Db. GAP5040-48-specific CD8+ T cell responses emerged from a
very large pool of naive Vβ8.1+ precursors, which dictated susceptibility
to cerebral malaria and conferred protection against recombinant Listeria
monocytogenes infection. Structural analysis of a prototypical Vβ8.1+
TCR-H-2Db-GAP5040-48 ternary complex revealed that germline-encoded
complementarity-determining region 1β residues present exclusively in the Vβ8.1
segment mediated essential interactions with the GAP5040-48 peptide.
Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Vβ8.1 functioned as an Ir gene
that was indispensable for immune reactivity against the malaria GAP5040-48
epitope.
