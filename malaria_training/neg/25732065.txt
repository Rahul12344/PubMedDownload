The genome-wide identification of gene functions in malaria parasites is hampered
by a lack of reverse genetic screening methods. We present a large-scale resource
of barcoded vectors with long homology arms for effective modification of the
Plasmodium berghei genome. Cotransfecting dozens of vectors into the haploid
blood stages creates complex pools of barcoded mutants, whose competitive fitness
can be measured during infection of a single mouse using barcode sequencing
(barseq). To validate the utility of this resource, we rescreen the P. berghei
kinome, using published kinome screens for comparison. We find that several
protein kinases function redundantly in asexual blood stages and confirm the
targetability of kinases cdpk1, gsk3, tkl3, and PBANKA_082960 by genotyping
cloned mutants. Thus, parallel phenotyping of barcoded mutants unlocks the power 
of reverse genetic screening for a malaria parasite and will enable the
systematic identification of genes essential for in vivo parasite growth and
transmission.
