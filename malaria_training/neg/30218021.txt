Malaria has provided a major selective pressure and has modulated the genetic
diversity of the human genome. The variants of the Duffy Antigen/Receptor for
Chemokines (DARC) gene have probably been selected by malaria parasites,
particularly the FY*O allele, which is fixed in sub-Saharan Africa and confers
resistance to Plasmodium vivax infection. Here, we showed the influence of
genomic ancestry on the distribution of DARC genotypes in a highly admixed
Brazilian population and confirmed the decreased susceptibility of the FY*A/FY*O 
genotype to clinical P. vivax malaria. FY*B/FY*O individuals were associated with
a greater risk of developing clinical malaria. A remarkable difference among DARC
variants concerning the susceptibility to clinical malaria was more evident for
individuals who were less exposed to malaria, as measured by the time of
residence in the endemic area. Additionally, we found that DARC-negative and
FY*A/FY*O individuals had a greater chance of acquiring high levels of antibodies
against the 19-kDa C-terminal region of the P. vivax merozoite surface protein-1.
Altogether, our results provide evidence that DARC polymorphisms modulate the
susceptibility to clinical P. vivax malaria and influence the naturally-acquired 
humoral immune response to malaria blood antigens, which may interfere with the
efficacy of a future vaccine against malaria.
