Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) has been an integral part of
characterizing the immunity of Anopheles mosquitoes towards Plasmodium invasion. 
Two anti-Plasmodium factors of Anopheles, thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1)
and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), play a role in the refractoriness of Anopheles
towards Plasmodium infection and are generally expressed during infection.
However, these are less studied in Anopheles dirus, a dominant malaria vector in 
Southeast Asia. Furthermore, most studies used a single reference gene for
normalization during gene expression analysis without proper validation. This may
lead to erroneous quantification of expression levels. Therefore, the present
study characterized and investigated the expression profiles of TEP1 and NOS of
Anopheles dirus during P.Â berghei infection. Prior to that, the elongation factor
1-alpha (EF1), actin 1 (Act) and ribosomal protein S7 (S7) genes were validated
for their suitability as a set of reference genes. TEP1 and NOS expressions in
An. dirus were found to be significantly induced after P. berghei infection.
