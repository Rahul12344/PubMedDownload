Plasmodium falciparum is an obligate intracellular parasite and the leading cause
of severe malaria responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality particularly
in sub-Saharan Africa. Successful completion of the P. falciparum genome
sequencing project in 2002 provided a comprehensive foundation for functional
genomic studies on this pathogen in the following decade. Over this period, a
large spectrum of experimental approaches has been deployed to improve and expand
the scope of functionally annotated genes. Meanwhile, rapidly evolving methods of
systems biology have also begun to contribute to a more global understanding of
various aspects of the biology and pathogenesis of malaria. Herein we provide an 
overview on metabolic modelling, which has the capability to integrate
information from functional genomics studies in P. falciparum and guide future
malaria research efforts towards the identification of novel candidate drug
targets.
