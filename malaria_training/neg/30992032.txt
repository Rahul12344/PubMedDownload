BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne diseases affect millions worldwide, with malaria alone
killing over 400 thousand people per year and affecting hundreds of millions. To 
date, the best strategy to prevent the disease remains insecticide-based mosquito
control. However, insecticide resistance as well as economic and social factors
reduce the effectiveness of the current methodologies. Alternative control
technologies are in development, including genetic control such as the sterile
insect technique (SIT). The SIT is a pivotal tool in integrated agricultural pest
management and could be used to improve malaria vector control. To apply the SIT 
and most other newer technologies against disease transmitting mosquitoes, it is 
essential that releases are composed of males with minimal female contamination. 
The removal of females is an essential requirement because released females can
themselves contribute towards nuisance biting and disease transmission. Thus,
females need to be eliminated from the cohorts prior to release. Manual
separation of Anopheles gambiae pupae or adult mosquitoes based on morphology is 
time consuming, is not feasible on a large scale and has limited the
implementation of the SIT technique. The doublesex (dsx) gene is one of the
effector switches of sex determination in the process of sex differentiation in
insects. Both males and females have specific splicing variants that are
expressed across the different life stages. Using RNA interference (RNAi) to
reduce expression of the female specific (dsxF) variant of this gene has proven
to have detrimental effects to the females in other mosquito species, such as
Aedes aegypti. We tested oral RNAi on dsx (AgdsxF) in An. gambiae.
METHODS: We studied the expression pattern of the dsx gene in the An. gambiae G3 
strain. We knocked down AgdsxF expression in larvae through oral delivery of
double stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by bacteria and observed its effects in
adults.
RESULTS: Our results show that feeding of AgdsxF dsRNA can effectively reduce
(> 66%) the mRNA of female dsx transcript and that there is a concomitant
reduction in the number of female larvae that achieve adulthood. Control groups
produced 52% (± 3.9% SE) of adult males and 48% (± 4.0% SE) females, while AgdsxF
dsRNA treated groups had 72.1% (± 4.0% SE) males vs 27.8% females (± 3.3% SE). In
addition, the female adults produce fewer progeny, 37.1% (± 8.2% SE) less than
the controls. The knockdown was sex-specific and had no impact on total numbers
of viable male adults, in the male dsx transcripts or male fitness parameters
such as longevity or body size.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that RNAi could be used to improve novel
mosquito control strategies that require efficient sex separation and male-only
release of An. gambiae by targeting sex determination genes such as AgdsxF. The
advantages of using RNAi in a controlled setting for mosquito rearing are
numerous, as the dose and time of exposure are controlled, and the possibility of
off-target effects and the waste of female production would be significantly
reduced.
