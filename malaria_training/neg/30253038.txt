Rare earth elements play a pivotal role in high-technology devices, are used as
contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging in clinical settings, are explored
as drug carriers for tumor photodynamic therapy, and are used as fertilizers.
From the biochemical viewpoint, they act not only as antagonists of Ca2+ but have
been proposed as alternative to Ca2+ in metallo-enzymes, in particular in Ce3+
-based methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). Up to now, the analysis of protein
sequence databases identified Ce3+ -based MHDs only in Archea and Bacteria. Here,
we report evidence that Ce3+ -based MDHs are also present in higher organisms.
These enzymes, identified in the parasite Plasmodium yoelii yoelii, in the spider
Nephila clavipes, in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii, and in Homo
sapiens, are encoded by intronless genes, thus representing a case of multiple,
independent lateral gene transfer from Prokaryotes to Eukaryotes. The
conservation of residues involved in the Ce3+ coordination, pyrroquinoline
quinone cofactor recognition and in the structure stabilization suggests that
these enzymes belong to the Ce3+ -dependent MDH family, hitherto considered as
exclusive of Prokaryotes. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(11):1067-1075, 2018.
