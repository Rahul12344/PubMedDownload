OBJECTIVE: To analyze the polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
protein (PfHRP) II and III.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of 20 patients infected with
Plasmodium falciparum in Yunnan Province. Blood samples were tested by microscopy
and RDTs. The Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 gene fragments were amplified by PCR and
sequenced. The sequencing results were analyzed and compared using the
bioinformatics software.
RESULTS: 20 patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum tested by microscopy and
RDTs. PCR showed that the Pfhrp2 gene was with 389~986 bp, and Pfhrp3 gene with
329-640 bp. All PfH-IRP II sequences started with type 1 repeat (AHHAHHVAD) and
ended with the type 12 repeat (AHHAAAHHEAATH). The number of type 7 (AHHAAD),
type 2 (AHHAHHAAD) and type 6 (AHHATD) within PfHRP II was more than the other
types of repeats, as well as type 16 (AHHAAN) and type 17 (AHHDG) for PfHRP III. 
Type 11 repeat (AHN) was not found from the PfHRP II and PfHRP III sequences.
CONCLUSION: There is an extensive diversity in Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 fragments in the
individuals infected with P. falciparum in Yunnan. Some types of repeats are
shared by PfHRP II and PfHRP III.
