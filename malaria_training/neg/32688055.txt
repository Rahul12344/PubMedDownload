The glycoprotein encoded by the ACKR1 gene expresses the Duffy blood group
antigens and is a receptor for malaria parasites. We recently described 18
long-range ACKR1 alleles in an autochthonous population of a malaria endemic
region. Extending this work, we sequenced the gene in a 53-sample repository
established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as reference reagents
for blood group genotyping. The FDA samples have been characterized for 19 genes;
however, long-range haplotype information for these genes, including ACKR1, was
lacking. We used a hybrid approach, novel for this type of gene, to characterize 
ACKR1 by combining two next-generation sequencing technologies, the short-read
massively parallel sequencing and the long-read nanopore sequencing. The
expedient integration of data from both next-generation sequencing systems were
necessary and sufficient to allow determination of all 25 long-range ACKR1
alleles found in the 53 samples accurately. All 25 alleles identified in our
current FDA cohort were novel and, unexpectedly, none had been observed among the
18 alleles in our previous study. The alleles will be useful for validation,
calibration, and proficiency testing of red cell genotyping. The lack of any
overlap between the ACKR1 alleles in the two studies documents differences in
mutation rate and recombination frequency among populations. The exact haplotype 
and their interethnic or interpopulation dissimilarities can influence disease
susceptibility and therapy.
