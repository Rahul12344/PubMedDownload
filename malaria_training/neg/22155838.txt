Novel conjugates of the antimalarial drug primaquine (compound 1) with ferrocene,
named primacenes, have been synthesized and screened for their activities against
blood stage and liver stage malaria in vitro and host-vector transmission in
vivo. Both transmission-blocking and blood-schizontocidal activities of the
parent drug were conserved only in primacenes bearing a basic aliphatic amine
group. Liver stage activity did not require this structural feature, and all
metallocenes tested were comparable to or better than primaquine in this regard. 
Remarkably, the replacement of primaquine's aliphatic chain by hexylferrocene, as
in compound 7, led to a ~45-fold-higher level activity against liver stage
parasitemia than that of primaquine.
