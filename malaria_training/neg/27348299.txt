The widespread distribution and relapsing nature of Plasmodium vivax infection
present major challenges for the elimination of malaria. To characterize the
genetic diversity of this parasite in individual infections and across the
population, we performed deep genome sequencing of >200 clinical samples
collected across the Asia-Pacific region and analyzed data on >300,000 SNPs and
nine regions of the genome with large copy number variations. Individual
infections showed complex patterns of genetic structure, with variation not only 
in the number of dominant clones but also in their level of relatedness and
inbreeding. At the population level, we observed strong signals of recent
evolutionary selection both in known drug resistance genes and at new loci, and
these varied markedly between geographical locations. These findings demonstrate 
a dynamic landscape of local evolutionary adaptation in the parasite population
and provide a foundation for genomic surveillance to guide effective strategies
for control and elimination of P. vivax.
