Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an innovative molecular
technique that has been validated for point-of-care testing to diagnose malaria. 
Molecular detection and tracking of anti-malarial drug resistance is mainly based
on highly sophisticated, costly and time-consuming techniques. With the
validation of resistance-associated gene mutations in malaria parasites, there is
a need to develop rapid, easy-to-use molecular tests for anti-malarial drug
resistance genotyping. LAMP could be further developed as a point-of-care test to
rapidly detect anti-malarial drug resistance-associated molecular markers,
thereby help detecting and monitoring drug resistance in surveillance studies.
