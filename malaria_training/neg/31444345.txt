Investigating the role that host erythrocyte proteins play in malaria infection
is hampered by the genetic intractability of this anucleate cell. Here we report 
that reticulocytes derived through in vitro differentiation of an
enucleation-competent immortalized erythroblast cell line (BEL-A) support both
successful invasion and intracellular development of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. Using CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and subsequent
complementation, we validate an essential role for the erythrocyte receptor
basigin in P. falciparum invasion and demonstrate rescue of invasive
susceptibility by receptor re-expression. Successful invasion of reticulocytes
complemented with a truncated mutant excludes a functional role for the basigin
cytoplasmic domain during invasion. Contrastingly, knockout of cyclophilin B,
reported to participate in invasion and interact with basigin, did not impact
invasive susceptibility of reticulocytes. These data establish the use of
reticulocytes derived from immortalized erythroblasts as a powerful model system 
to explore hypotheses regarding host receptor requirements for P. falciparum
invasion.
