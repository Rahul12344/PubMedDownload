BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) partner drugs, currently 
used in Ghana are lumefantrine, amodiaquine and piperaquine. Plasmodium
falciparum isolates with reduced susceptibility to these partner drugs may affect
treatment outcome. Mutations in pfmdr1 gene is linked to reduced parasite
susceptibility to amodiaquine and lumefantrine. In addition, the potency of the
partner drugs in vivo depends on the metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
enzyme in the host. Mutations in the CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 genes are linked to
reduced metabolism of amodiaquine and lumefantrine in vitro, respectively. This
study investigated the host and parasite genetic factors affecting the
susceptibility of the malaria parasite to ACT partner drugs.
METHODS: Archived samples from 240 patients age ≤ 9 years participating in
anti-malarial drug resistance survey in Ghana, and given artemether with
lumefantrine (AL) or artesunate with amodiaquine (AA), were selected and
analysed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing was used 
to determine the polymorphisms in CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and pfmdr1 genes.
RESULTS: For CYP3A4, all had wild type alleles, suggesting that the hosts are
good metabolizers of lumefantrine. For CYP2C8 60% had wild type alleles, 35%
heterozygous and 5% homozygous recessive alleles suggesting efficient metabolism 
of amodiaquine by the hosts. For pfmdr1 gene, at codon 86, 95% were wild type
(N86) and 5% mutant (Y86). For codon 184, 36% were wild type (Y184) and 64%
mutant (F184) while for codons 1034, 1042 and 1246, 100% (all) were wild type.
The high prevalence of N86-F184-D1246 haplotype (NFD) suggest presence of
parasites with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine and not amodiaquine.
Delayed clearance was observed in individuals with mutations in the pfmdr1 gene
and not cytochrome 450 gene. Both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were
observed in the pfmdr1 at low prevalence.
CONCLUSION: The outcome of this study indicates that the parasite's genetic
factors rather than the host's are likely to drive resistance to ACT in Ghana.
