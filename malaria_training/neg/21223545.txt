BACKGROUND: Over its life cycle, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is exposed to
different environmental conditions, particularly to variations in O2 pressure.
For example, the parasite circulates in human venous blood at 5% O2 pressure and 
in arterial blood, particularly in the lungs, at 13% O2 pressure. Moreover, the
parasite is exposed to 21% O2 levels in the salivary glands of mosquitoes.
METHODS: To study the metabolic adaptation of P. falciparum to different oxygen
pressures during the intraerythrocytic cycle, a combined approach using
transcriptomic and proteomic techniques was undertaken.
RESULTS: Even though hyperoxia lengthens the parasitic cycle, significant
transcriptional changes were detected in hyperoxic conditions in the late-ring
stage. Using PS 6.0 ™ software (Ariadne Genomics) for microarray analysis, this
study demonstrate up-expression of genes involved in antioxidant systems and
down-expression of genes involved in the digestive vacuole metabolism and the
glycolysis in favour of mitochondrial respiration. Proteomic analysis revealed
increased levels of heat shock proteins, and decreased levels of glycolytic
enzymes. Some of this regulation reflected post-transcriptional modifications
during the hyperoxia response.
CONCLUSIONS: These results seem to indicate that hyperoxia activates antioxidant 
defence systems in parasites to preserve the integrity of its cellular
structures. Moreover, environmental constraints seem to induce an energetic
metabolism adaptation of P. falciparum. This study provides a better
understanding of the adaptive capabilities of P. falciparum to environmental
changes and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets.
