Traditional methods of localizing and quantifying the presence of pathogenic
microorganisms in living experimental animal models of infections have mostly
relied on sacrificing the animals, dissociating the tissue and counting the
number of colony forming units. However, the discovery of several varieties of
the light producing enzyme, luciferase, and the genetic engineering of bacteria, 
fungi, parasites and mice to make them emit light, either after administration of
the luciferase substrate, or in the case of the bacterial lux operon without any 
exogenous substrate, has provided a new alternative. Dedicated bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) cameras can record the light emitted from living animals in real
time allowing non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of the anatomical location
and growth of infectious microorganisms as measured by strength of the BLI
signal. BLI technology has been used to follow bacterial infections in traumatic 
skin wounds and burns, osteomyelitis, infections in intestines, Mycobacterial
infections, otitis media, lung infections, biofilm and endodontic infections and 
meningitis. Fungi that have been engineered to be bioluminescent have been used
to study infections caused by yeasts (Candida) and by filamentous fungi.
Parasitic infections caused by malaria, Leishmania, trypanosomes and toxoplasma
have all been monitored by BLI. Viruses such as vaccinia, herpes simplex,
hepatitis B and C and influenza, have been studied using BLI. This rapidly
growing technology is expected to continue to provide much useful information,
while drastically reducing the numbers of animals needed in experimental studies.
