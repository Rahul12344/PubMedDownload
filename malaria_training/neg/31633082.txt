Mounting evidence supports the idea that epigenetic, and the overall
3-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome, plays an important role in gene
expression for eukaryotic organisms. We recently used Hi-C methodologies to
generate and compare the 3D genome of 7 different apicomplexan parasites,
including several pathogenic and less pathogenic malaria parasites as well as
related human parasites Babesia microti and Toxoplasma gondii. Our goal was to
understand the possible relationship between genome organization, gene
expression, and pathogenicity of these infectious agents. Collectively, our
results demonstrate that spatial genome organization in most Plasmodium species
is constrained by the colocalization of virulence genes that are unique in their 
effect on chromosome folding, indicating a link between genome organization and
gene expression in more virulent pathogens.
