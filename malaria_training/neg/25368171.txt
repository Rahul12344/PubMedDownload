Female insects generally mate multiple times during their lives. A notable
exception is the female malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, which after sex loses
her susceptibility to further copulation. Sex in this species also renders
females competent to lay eggs developed after blood feeding. Despite intense
research efforts, the identity of the molecular triggers that cause the
postmating switch in females, inducing a permanent refractoriness to further
mating and triggering egg-laying, remains elusive. Here we show that the
male-transferred steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is a key regulator of
monandry and oviposition in An. gambiae. When sexual transfer of 20E is impaired 
by partial inactivation of the hormone and inhibition of its biosynthesis in
males, oviposition and refractoriness to further mating in the female are
strongly reduced. Conversely, mimicking sexual delivery by injecting 20E into
virgin females switches them to an artificial mated status, triggering egg-laying
and reducing susceptibility to copulation. Sexual transfer of 20E appears to
incapacitate females physically from receiving seminal fluids by a second male.
Comparative analysis of microarray data from females after mating and after 20E
treatment indicates that 20E-regulated molecular pathways likely are implicated
in the postmating switch, including cytoskeleton and musculature-associated genes
that may render the atrium impenetrable to additional mates. By revealing signals
and pathways shaping key processes in the An. gambiae reproductive biology, our
data offer new opportunities for the control of natural populations of malaria
vectors.
