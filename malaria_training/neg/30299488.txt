BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced brain injury is a nonnegligible issue in the
management of cancer patients treated by partial or whole brain irradiation. In
particular, temporal lobe injury (TLI), a deleterious late complication in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, greatly affects the long-term life quality of these
patients. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully
identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radiation
toxicity, genetic variants contributing to the radiation-induced brain injury
have not yet been assessed.
METHODS: We recruited and performed follow-up for a prospective observational
cohort, Genetic Architecture of Radiotherapy Toxicity and Prognosis, using
magnetic resonance imaging for TLI diagnosis. We conducted genome-wide
association analysis in 1082 patients and validated the top associations in two
independent cohorts of 1119 and 741 patients, respectively. All statistical tests
were two-sided.
RESULTS: We identified a promoter variant rs17111237 (A > G, minor allele
frequency [MAF] = 0.14) in CEP128 associated with TLI risk (hazard ratio = 1.45, 
95% confidence interval = 1.26 to 1.66, Pcombined=3.18 × 10-7) which is in
moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs162171 (MAF = 0.18, R2 = 0.69), the
top signal in CEP128 (hazard ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.66,
Pcombined= 6.17 × 10-9). Combining the clinical variables with the top SNP, we
divided the patients into different subgroups with varying risk with 5-year
TLI-free rates ranging from 33.7% to 95.5%. CEP128, a key component of mother
centriole, tightly interacts with multiple radiation-resistant genes and plays an
important role in maintaining the functional cilia, which otherwise will lead to 
a malfunction of the neural network. We found that A > G alteration at rs17111237
impaired the promoter activity of CEP128 and knockdown of CEP128 decreased the
clonogenic cell survival of U87 cells under radiation. Noteworthy, 12.7% (27/212)
of the GWAS-based associated genes (P < .001) were enriched in the neurogenesis
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This three-stage study is the first GWAS of radiation-induced brain 
injury that implicates the genetic susceptibility gene CEP128 involved in TLI
development and provides the novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of
radiation-induced brain injury.
