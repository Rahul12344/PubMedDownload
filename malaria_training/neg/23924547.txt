BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid resistance has been well documented in Anopheles
arabiensis, one of the major African malaria vectors, and the predominant malaria
vector in South Africa.
METHODS: In this study, the genetic basis of pyrethroid resistance in a selected 
laboratory strain of An. arabiensis from South Africa was investigated using a
custom-made microarray, known as the An. gambiae detoxification chip.
RESULTS: A large number of P450 genes were over-transcribed, as well as a suite
of redox genes and glutathione S-transferases. The five genes that showed the
highest level of gene transcription when compared with an insecticide susceptible
strain were: CYP6AG2, CYPZ1, TPX2, CYPZ2 and CYP6P1.
CONCLUSIONS: Permethrin resistance in South African An. arabiensis is associated 
with increased transcription of multiple genes, and a large proportion of these
genes were also previously recorded as over-transcribed in another An. arabiensis
strain selected for resistance to DDT with cross-resistance to deltamethrin. The 
deltamethrin resistance developed de novo in the DDT-selected strain and is most 
likely due to increased transcription of those genes associated with DDT
resistance. However, of particular interest was the fact that the strain selected
for resistance to pyrethroids did not develop de novo resistance to DDT. These
differences are compared and discussed.
