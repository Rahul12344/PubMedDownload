Plasmodium vivax shows a strict host tropism for reticulocytes. We identified
transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for P. vivax reticulocyte-binding
protein 2b (PvRBP2b). We determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of
PvRBP2b involved in red blood cell binding, elucidating the molecular basis for
TfR1 recognition. We validated TfR1 as the biological target of PvRBP2b
engagement by means of TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells
deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of P. vivax but not to
invasion of P. falciparum Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show
that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit reticulocyte binding also block
P. vivax entry into reticulocytes. These data show that TfR1-PvRBP2b invasion
pathway is critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during P. vivax
invasion.
