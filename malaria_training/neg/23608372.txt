OBJECTIVE: To evaluate microscopy, OptiMAL(®) and multiplex PCR for the
identification of Plasmodium falciparumm (P. falciparum) and Plasmodium vivax (P.
vivax) from the field isolates of Bikaner, Rajasthan (Northwest India).
METHODS: In this study, a multiplex PCR (P. falciparum and P. vivax) was further 
developed with the incorporation of Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae) specific
primer and also a positive control. The performance of microscopy, plasmodium
lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) based malaria rapid diagnostic test OptiMAL(®) and
18S rRNA gene based multiplex PCR for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax
was compared.
RESULTS: The three species multiplex PCR (P. falciparum, P. vivax and P.
malariae) with an inbuilt positive control was developed and evaluated. In
comparison with multiplex PCR, which showed the sensitivity and specificity of
99.36% (95%CI, 98.11%-100.00%) and 100.00% (95%CI, 100.00%-100.00%), the
sensitivity and specificity of microscopy was 90.44% (95%CI, 88.84%-95.04%) and
99.22% (95%CI, 97.71%-100.00%), and OptiMAL(®) was 93.58% (95%CI, 89.75%-97.42%) 
and 97.69% (95%CI, 95.10%-100.00%). The efficiencies were 99.65%, 95.10% and
95.45% for multiplex PCR, microscopy and OptiMAL(®), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results raise concerns over the overall sensitivities of
microscopy and OptiMAL(®), when compared to the multiplex PCR and thus stress the
need for new molecular interventions in the accurate detection of the malarial
parasites. This further highlights the fact that further developments are needed 
to improve the performance of rapid diagnostic tests at field level.
