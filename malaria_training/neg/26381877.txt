BACKGROUND: The extensive use of pyrethroids for control of malaria vectors,
driven by their cost, efficacy and safety, has led to widespread resistance. To
favor their sustainable use, the World Health Organization (WHO) formulated an
insecticide resistance management plan, which includes the identification of the 
mechanisms of resistance and resistance surveillance. Recognized physiological
mechanisms of resistance include target site mutations in the para voltage-gated 
sodium channel, metabolic detoxification and penetration resistance. Such
understanding of resistance mechanisms has allowed the development of resistance 
monitoring tools, including genotyping of the kdr mutation L1014F/S in the para
gene.
METHODS: The sequence-based technique RNA-seq was applied to study changes in the
transcriptome of deltamethrin-resistant and -susceptible Anopheles gambiae
mosquitoes from the Western Province of Kenya. The resulting gene expression
profiles were compared to data in the most recent literature to derive a list of 
candidate resistance genes. RNA-seq data were analyzed also to identify sequence 
polymorphisms linked to resistance.
RESULTS: A total of five candidate-resistance genes (AGAP04177, AGAP004572,
AGAP008840, AGAP007530 and AGAP013036) were identified with altered expression
between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes from West and East Africa. A change 
from G to C at position 36043997 of chromosome 3R resulting in A101G of the
sulfotransferase gene AGAP009551 was significantly associated with the resistance
phenotype (odds ratio: 5.10). The kdr L1014S mutation was detected at similar
frequencies in both phenotypically resistant and susceptible mosquitoes,
suggesting it is no longer fully predictive of the resistant phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results support the conclusion that resistance to
pyrethroids is a complex and evolving phenotype, dependent on multiple gene
functions including, but not limited to, metabolic detoxification. Functional
convergence among metabolic detoxification genes may exist, with the role of each
gene being modulated by the life history and selection pressure on mosquito
populations. As a consequence, biochemical assays that quantify overall enzyme
activity may be a more suitable method for predicting metabolic resistance than
gene-based assays.
