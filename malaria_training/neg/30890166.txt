BACKGROUND: Cytauxzoon felis is a tick-transmitted apicomplexan that causes
cytauxzoonosis in domestic cats (Felis catus). Even with intensive care, the
mortality rate of acute cytauxzoonosis approaches 40% in domestic cats, while
bobcats (Lynx rufus), the natural intermediate host of C. felis, remain
clinically asymptomatic. However, multiple reports of domestic cats surviving
acute disease without any treatment exist. One hypothesis for survival of these
cats is infection with unique C. felis genotypes of lower pathogenicity. Prior
studies have identified genetically distinct C. felis isolates containing
polymorphisms within internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of the rRNA
operon. However, these polymorphisms do not correlate with the clinical outcome
of cytauxzoonosis, and so additional genetic markers are needed to test this
hypothesis. We selected C. felis apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1) as a potential 
genetic marker of differential pathogenicity. AMA1 is a vaccine candidate for
relatives of C. felis within Plasmodium spp.; however its historically high level
of genetic polymorphism has resulted in escape from vaccine-induced immunity.
While such diversity has hindered vaccine development, the expected polymorphism 
within the ama1 gene may be useful to evaluate population genetics.
RESULTS: A 677 bp sequence of the C. felis ama1 gene was PCR-amplified from 84
domestic cats and 9 bobcats and demonstrated 99.9% sequence identity across all
samples. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified in domestic cats
and bobcats with evidence for co-infection with both genotypes identified in two 
domestic cats. The prevalence of the two genotypes varied with geographical
distribution in domestic cats. Nucleotide diversity (π) and haplotype diversity
(H) were calculated for C. felis ama1 and ama1 of related apicomplexans to assess
genetic diversity. Based on these values (π = 0.00067 and H = 0.457), the
diversity of the C. felis ama1 gene region analyzed is considerably lower than
what is documented in related apicomplexans.
CONCLUSIONS: In surprising contrast to related apicomplexans, our results support
that the sequence of the C. felis ama1 gene is highly conserved. While lack of
genetic diversity limits utility of C. felis AMA1 as a genetic marker for
clinical outcome, it supports further investigation as a vaccine candidate for
cytauxzoonosis.
