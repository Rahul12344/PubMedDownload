Aim: The objective of this research was to determine the species and strains of
Leucocytozoon caulleryi and study the phylogenetics of L. caulleryi of broiler
chickens in endemic areas in Indonesia.
Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from broiler chickens
originated from endemic area in Indonesia, i.e., Pasuruan, Lamongan, Blitar,
Lumajang, Boyolali, Purwokerto, and Banjarmasin in 2017. Collected blood was used
for microscopic examination, sequencing using BLAST method to identify the
nucleotide structure of cytochrome b (cyt b) gene that determines the species,
and the phylogenetics analysis of L. caulleryi that infected broiler chickens in 
endemic areas in Indonesia, using Mega 5 software.
Results: The results showed that Plasmodium sp. and L. caulleryi were infected
broiler chickens in endemic areas in Indonesia. L. caulleryi in one area had very
close phylogenetic relations with those in other areas. The genetic distance
between L. caulleryi taxa from various endemic areas is very close (<5%).
Conclusion: There is a very close phylogenetics among strains of L. caulleryi
that infected broiler chickens in various endemic areas in Indonesia.
