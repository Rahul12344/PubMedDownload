Salivary gland proteins from female Aedes aegypti mosquito were extracted and
analyzed on high-resolution mass spectrometry. Proteomic data was analysed using 
two search algorithms SEQUEST and Mascot, which results in acquisition of 83,836 
spectra which were assigned to 5417 peptides belonging to 1208 proteins.These
proteins were then assigned molecular functions and further analysis revealed
biological processes they are involved in using Gene Ontology annotations.
Several immunity related pathways were found to be enriched in salivary gland.The
data of this study are also related to the research article "Mosquito-Borne
Diseases and Omics: Salivary gland proteome of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito"
(Dhawan et al., 2017) [1]. These data are deposited in ProteomeXchange in the
public dataset PXD002468. In addition,a scientific interpretation of this dataset
by Dhawan et al. [1] is available at
