The Plasmodium falciparum genome being AT-rich, the presence of GC-rich regions
suggests functional significance. Evolution imposes selection pressure to retain 
functionally important coding and regulatory elements. Hence searching for
evolutionarily conserved GC-rich, intergenic regions in an AT-rich genome will
help in discovering new coding regions and regulatory elements. We have used
elevated GC content in intergenic regions coupled with sequence conservation
against P. reichenowi, which is evolutionarily closely related to P. falciparum
to identify potential sequences of functional importance. Interestingly, ~30% of 
the GC-rich, conserved sequences were associated with antigenic proteins encoded 
by var and rifin genes. The majority of sequences identified in the 5' UTR of var
genes are represented by short expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in cDNA libraries
signifying that they are transcribed in the parasite. Additionally, 19 sequences 
were located in the 3' UTR of rifins and 4 also have overlapping ESTs. Further
analysis showed that several sequences associated with var genes have the
capacity to encode small peptides. A previous report has shown that upstream
peptides can regulate the expression of var genes hence we propose that these
conserved GC-rich sequences may play roles in regulation of gene expression.
