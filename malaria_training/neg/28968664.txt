Background: Complete malaria eradication and optimal use of transmission-reducing
interventions require knowledge of submicroscopic infectious reservoirs among
asymptomatic individuals. Even submicroscopic levels of Plasmodium falciparum
gametocytes can infect mosquitoes and promote onward transmission. Most efforts
to identify gametocyte carriers use polymerase chain reaction amplification of
the gametocyte-specific transcript Pfs25.
Methods: To expand the repertoire of biomarkers available for superior gametocyte
detection, we compared the gene expression profiles of gametocytes and
asynchronous blood-stage P. falciparum parasites by microarray technology. This
allowed the identification of 56 molecules abundantly expressed in the gametocyte
stage of the parasite. The analytical sensitivity for gametocyte detection was
evaluated for 25 genes with the highest expression levels.
Results: One candidate, Pfg17, exhibited superior analytical sensitivity against 
a panel of gametocyte-spiked whole blood, detecting 10 gametocytes/mL; in
comparison, Pfs25 detected only 25.3 gametocytes/mL. Pfg17 also exhibited
superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 19.1% more samples from blood-film
microscopy-negative Ghanaian children and 40% more samples from asymptomatic
adults as gametocyte positive.
Conclusions: Cumulatively, our results suggest Pfg17 is an excellent biomarker
for detecting asymptomatic infectious reservoirs otherwise missed by the most
sensitive molecular method available. Our study has also improved the repertoire 
of transmission-stage antigens available for evaluation as candidate vaccines.
