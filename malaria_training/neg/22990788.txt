Due to the A/T-richness of the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, expressing P.
falciparum proteins in heterologous expression systems is challenging. In
addition, many P. falciparum proteins have high cysteine content and high
molecular weight, which further complicates expression of these proteins in
heterologous systems. The high molecular weight Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte
Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesins expressed on the surface of the infected
erythrocytes are among the most difficult proteins to express. Cost reduction in 
synthetic gene synthesis, as well as improved eukaryotic expression systems, now 
makes it possible to express such proteins. In this chapter, we describe the
construction, production, purification, and functional assessment of the
full-length extracellular region of the var2CSA PfEMP1 protein involved in
pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), using a human embryonic kidney (HEK)
expression system.
