Discovery and characterization of two Nimrod superfamily members in Anopheles
gambiae.

Anti-bacterial proteins in mosquitoes are known to play an important modulatory
role on immune responses to infections with human pathogens including malaria
parasites. In this study we characterized two members of the Anopheles gambiae
Nimrod superfamily, namely AgNimB2 and AgEater. We confirm that current
annotation of the An. gambiae genome incorrectly identifies AgNimB2 and AgEater
as a single gene, AGAP009762. Through in silico and experimental approaches, it
has been shown that AgNimB2 is a secreted protein that mediates phagocytosis of
Staphylococcus aureus but not of Escherichia coli bacteria. We also reveal that
this function does not involve a direct interaction of AgNimB2 with S. aureus.
Therefore, AgNimB2 may act downstream of complement-like pathway activation,
first requiring bacterial opsonization. In addition, it has been shown that
AgNimB2 has an anti-Plasmodium effect. Conversely, AgEater is a membrane-bound
protein that either functions redundantly or is dispensable for phagocytosis of
E. coli or S. aureus. Our study provides insights into the role of members of the
complex Nimrod superfamily in An. gambiae, the most important African vector of
human malaria.
