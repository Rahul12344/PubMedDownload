The rodent parasite Plasmodium chabaudi is an important in vivo model of malaria.
The ability to produce chronic infections makes it particularly useful for
investigating the development of anti- Plasmodium immunity, as well as features
associated with parasite virulence during both the acute and chronic phases of
infection. P. chabaudi also undergoes asexual maturation (schizogony) and
erythrocyte invasion in culture, so offers an experimentally-amenable in vivo to 
in vitro model for studying gene function and drug activity during parasite
replication. To extend the usefulness of this model, we have further optimised
transfection protocols and plasmids for P. chabaudi and generated stable,
fluorescent lines that are free from drug-selectable marker genes. These
mother-lines show the same infection dynamics as wild-type parasites throughout
the lifecycle in mice and mosquitoes; furthermore, their virulence can be
increased by serial blood passage and reset by mosquito transmission. We have
also adapted the large-insert, linear PlasmoGEM vectors that have revolutionised 
the scale of experimental genetics in another rodent malaria parasite and used
these to generate barcoded P. chabaudi gene-deletion and -tagging vectors for
transfection in our fluorescent P. chabaudi mother-lines. This produces a
tool-kit of P. chabaudi lines, vectors and transfection approaches that will be
of broad utility to the research community.
