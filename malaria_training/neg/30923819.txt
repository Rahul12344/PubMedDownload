BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance poses a serious threat to insecticide-based
interventions in Africa. There is a fear that resistance escalation could
jeopardize malaria control efforts. Monitoring of cases of aggravation of
resistance intensity and its impact on the efficacy of control tools is crucial
to predict consequences of resistance.
METHODS: The resistance levels of an Anopheles funestus population from Palmeira,
southern Mozambique, were characterized and their impact on the efficacy of
various insecticide-treated nets established.
RESULTS: A dramatic loss of efficacy of all long-lasting insecticidal nets
(LLINs), including piperonyl butoxide (PBO)-based nets (Olyset Plus), was
observed. This An. funestus population consistently (2016, 2017, and 2018)
exhibited a high degree of pyrethroid resistance. Molecular analyses revealed
that this resistance escalation was associated with a massive overexpression of
the duplicated cytochrome P450 genes CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b, and also the fixation
of the resistance CYP6P9a_R allele in this population in 2016 (100%) in contrast 
to 2002 (5%). However, the low recovery of susceptibility after PBO synergist
assay suggests that other resistance mechanisms could be involved.
CONCLUSIONS: The loss of efficacy of pyrethroid-based LLINs with and without PBO 
is a concern for the effectiveness of insecticide-based interventions, and action
should be taken to prevent the spread of such super-resistance.
