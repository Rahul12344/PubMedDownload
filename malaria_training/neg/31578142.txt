BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been described as a source of
genetic material to analyse malaria parasites in proof-of-concept studies. The
increasing use of RDTs (e.g., in focal or mass screening and treatment campaigns)
makes this approach particularly attractive for large-scale investigations of
parasite populations. In this study, the complexity of Plasmodium falciparum
infections, parasite load and chloroquine resistance transporter gene mutations
were investigated in DNA samples extracted from positive RDTs, obtained in a
routine setting and archived at ambient temperature.
METHODS: A total of 669 archived RDTs collected from malaria cases in urban,
semi-urban and rural areas of central Gabon were used for P. falciparum DNA
extraction. Performance of RDTs as a source of DNA for PCR was determined using: 
(i) amplification of a single copy merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) gene
followed by highly sensitive and automated capillary electrophoresis; (ii)
genotyping of the pfcrt gene locus 72-76 using haplotype-specific-probe-based
real-time PCR to characterize chloroquine resistance; and, (iii) real-time PCR
targeting 18S genes to detect and quantify Plasmodium parasites.
RESULTS: Out of the 669 archived RDTs, amplification of P. falciparum nucleic
materials had a success rate of 97% for 18S real-time PCR, and 88% for the msp1
gene. The multiplicity of infections (MOI) of the whole population was 2.6 (95%
CI 2.5-2.8). The highest number of alleles detected in one infection was 11. The 
MOI decreased with increasing age (β = - 0.0046, p = 0.02) and residence in
Lambaréné was associated with smaller MOIs (p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of
mutations associated with chloroquine resistance was 78.5% and was not associated
with age. In Lambaréné, prevalence of chloroquine resistance was lower compared
to rural Moyen-Ogooué (β = - 0.809, p-value = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: RDT is a reliable source of DNA for P. falciparum detection and
genotyping assays. Furthermore, the increasing use of RDTs allows them to be an
alternative source of DNA for large-scale genetic epidemiological studies.
Parasite populations in the study area are highly diverse and prevalence of
chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum remains high, especially in rural areas.
