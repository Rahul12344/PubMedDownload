Horizontal gene transfer from human host to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase confers
drug resistance and partly compensates for replication deficits.

We investigated the origin and the effect of insertion D67D-THGERDLGPA within
HIV-1 RT from a patient failing antiviral therapy. The insertion developed within
the context of pre-existing NRTI and NNRTI mutations (M41L, L210W, T215Y and
N348I). Concurrently, the NRTI mutations T69I and V118I and the NNRTI mutations
K103N and Y181C were detected for the first time. High-level drug resistance
(fold-changes≥50) and a good replication capacity (87% of wild-type) were
observed, significantly higher than for the previous virus without insertion. The
insertion was very similar to a region within human chromosome 17 (31/34
nucleotide identity), and had already been detected independently in a Japanese
HIV-1 isolate. These results suggest that a particular sequence within human
chromosome 17 is prone to horizontal gene transfer into the HIV-1 RT finger
subdomain. This insertion confers selective advantage to HIV-1 by its
contribution to multi-drug resistance and restoration of impaired replication
capacity.
