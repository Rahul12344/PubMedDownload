Many important pathogens such as HIV/AIDS, influenza, malaria, dengue and
meningitis generally exist in phenotypically distinct serotypes that compete for 
hosts. Models used to study these diseases appear as meta-population systems.
Herein, we revisit one of the multiple strain models that have been used to
investigate the dynamics of infectious diseases with co-circulating serotypes or 
strains, and provide analytical results underlying the numerical investigations. 
In particular, we establish the necessary conditions for the local asymptotic
stability of the steady states and for the existence of oscillatory behaviors via
Hopf bifurcation. In addition, we show that the existence of discrete antigenic
forms among pathogens can either fully or partially self-organize, where (i)
strains exhibit no strain structures and coexist or (ii) antigenic variants sort 
into non-overlapping or minimally overlapping clusters that either undergo the
principle of competitive exclusion exhibiting discrete strain structures, or
co-exist cyclically.
