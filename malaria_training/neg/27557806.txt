BACKGROUND: Haplotypes are important in anti-malarial drug resistance because
genes encoding drug resistance may accumulate mutations at several codons in the 
same gene, each mutation increasing the level of drug resistance and, possibly,
reducing the metabolic costs of previous mutation. Patients often have two or
more haplotypes in their blood sample which may make it impossible to identify
exactly which haplotypes they carry, and hence to measure the type and frequency 
of resistant haplotypes in the malaria population.
RESULTS: This study presents two novel statistical methods
expectation-maximization (EM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to
investigate this issue. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated on
simulated datasets consisting of patient blood characterized by their
multiplicity of infection (MOI) and malaria genotype. The datasets are generated 
using different resistance allele frequencies (RAF) at each single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and different limit of detection (LoD) of the SNPs and the
MOI. The EM and the MCMC algorithm are validated and appear more accurate, faster
and slightly less affected by LoD of the SNPs and the MOI compared to previous
related statistical approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: The EM and the MCMC algorithms perform well when analysing malaria
genetic data obtained from infected human blood samples. The results are robust
to genotyping errors caused by LoDs and function well even in the absence of MOI 
data on individual patients.
