Malaria is one of the most challenging human infectious diseases, and both
prevention and control have been hindered by the development of Plasmodium
falciparum resistance to existing therapies. Several new compounds with novel
mechanisms are in clinical development for the treatment of malaria, including
DSM265, an inhibitor of Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. To explore the
mechanisms by which resistance might develop to DSM265 in the field, we selected 
for DSM265-resistant P. falciparum parasites in vitro. Any of five different
amino acid changes led to reduced efficacy on the parasite and to decreased
DSM265 binding to P. falciparum DHODH. The DSM265-resistant parasites retained
full sensitivity to atovaquone. All but one of the observed mutations were in the
DSM265 binding site, and the remaining C276F was in the adjacent flavin cofactor 
site. The C276F mutation was previously identified in a recrudescent parasite
during a Phase IIa clinical study. We confirmed that this mutation (and the
related C276Y) accounted for the full level of observed DSM265 resistance by
regenerating the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. X-ray structure
analysis of the C276F mutant enzyme showed that conformational changes of nearby 
residues were required to accommodate the larger F276 residue, which in turn led 
to a restriction in the size of the DSM265 binding pocket. These findings
underscore the importance of developing DSM265 as part of a combination therapy
with other agents for successful use against malaria.
