Nearly two-thirds of the proteins encoded by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite 
that causes the most deadly form of malaria, are annotated as "hypothetical." The
yeast two-hybrid assay, which requires no prior knowledge about the target
protein, has great potential to provide functional information about these
uncharacterized proteins. However, P. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens are
hampered by the poor expression of P. falciparum genes in yeast. AU-rich
sequences in nascent P. falciparum transcripts resemble the 3' end processing
sites in yeast mRNAs, and are prematurely cleaved and polyadenylated. In most
cases, these aberrant messages are degraded and yield no protein. To overcome
this limitation, we have developed methods to extensively fragment P. falciparum 
genes. Novel yeast two-hybrid vectors, in which auxotrophic markers are fused to 
the 3' ends of the cloned inserts, are employed to identify those gene fragments 
that are expressed in yeast. In this chapter, we provide detailed protocols for
fragmenting P. falciparum genes, creating P. falciparum activation domain
libraries, and performing P. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens. Though focused 
on P. falciparum, the approaches described here are applicable to other organisms
and are likely to be especially useful for those with AT-rich genomes, which are 
also likely to be poorly expressed in yeast.
