We used a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array to genotype 75
Plasmodium falciparum isolates recently collected from Senegal and The Gambia to 
search for signals of selection in this malaria endemic region. We found little
geographic or temporal stratification of the genetic diversity among the sampled 
parasites. Through application of the iHS and REHH haplotype-based tests for
positive selection, we found evidence of recent selective sweeps at a known drug 
resistance locus, at several known antigenic loci, and at several genomic regions
not previously identified as sites of recent selection. We discuss the value of
deep population-specific genomic analyses for identifying selection signals
within sampled endemic populations of parasites, which may correspond to local
selection pressures such as distinctive therapeutic regimes or mosquito vectors.
