The objective of this study was to validate the use of pftetQ and pfmdt genes as 
molecular markers of decreased in vitro susceptibility to doxycycline in 113
Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Dakar, Senegal. The results show that copy
numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt, estimated by TaqMan real-time PCR, are not
significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to doxycycline in vitro;
however, the number of samples with a high doxycycline IC(50) was likely to be
too low to derive statistically significant results. Thus, no definitive
conclusions could be drawn. The markers should be further tested by analysing
more isolates.
