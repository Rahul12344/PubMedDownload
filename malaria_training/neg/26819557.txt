Malaria remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases and results in
significant mortality. Isothermal amplification (loop-mediated isothermal
amplification) is used to detect malarial DNA at levels of ~1 parasite/µL blood
in ≤30 minutes without the isolation of parasite nucleic acid from subject's
blood or saliva. The technique targets the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
subunit 1 gene and is capable of distinguishing Plasmodium falciparum from
Plasmodium vivax. Malarial diagnosis by the gold standard microscopic examination
of blood smears is generally carried out only after moderate-to-severe symptoms
appear. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests are available but generally require
infection levels in the range of 200-2,000 parasites/µL for a positive diagnosis 
and cannot distinguish if the disease has been cleared due to the persistence of 
circulating antigen. This study describes a rapid and simple molecular assay to
detect malarial genes directly from whole blood or saliva without DNA isolation.
