Tick saliva facilitates tick feeding and infection of the host. Gene expression
analysis of tick salivary glands and other tissues involved in host-pathogen
interactions has revealed a wide range of bioactive tick proteins. Transcriptomic
analysis has been a milestone in the field and has recently been enhanced by
next-generation sequencing (NGS). Furthermore, the application of quantitative
proteomics to ticks with unknown genomes has provided deeper insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying tick hematophagy, pathogen transmission, and
tick-host-pathogen interactions. We review current knowledge on the
transcriptomics and proteomics of tick tissues from a systems-biology perspective
and discuss future challenges in the field.
