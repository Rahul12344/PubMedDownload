RNA interference is a potent and precise reverse genetic approach to carryout
large-scale functional genomic studies in a given organism. During the past
decade, RNAi has also emerged as an important investigative tool to understand
the process of viral pathogenesis. Our laboratory has successfully generated
transgenic reporter and RNAi sensor line of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells
and developed a reversal of silencing assay via siRNA or shRNA guided screening
to investigate RNAi factors or viral pathogenic factors with extraordinary
fidelity. Here we describe empirical approaches and conceptual understanding to
execute successful RNAi screening in Spodoptera frugiperda 21-cell line.
