Plasmodium vivax is still the more prevalent human Plasmodium outside Africa and 
despite this fact, there is still a deep lack of knowledge on its biology.
Metacaspases are cysteine proteases related to metazoan caspases, involved in
programmed cell death. Here, we have characterized the P. vivax metacaspase 1
gene in a total of 63 vivax isolates, 32 isolates collected in southern Iran and 
31 Italian imported isolates originating from 12 different endemic countries. We 
have firstly identified DNA size polymorphism in P. vivax metacaspase 1 gene. A
total of four different allelic sizes were found, resulting from the insertion of
1 to 4 tandem repeat units located within the intronic region of the P. vivax
metacaspase 1. Similarly, we also have identified four distinct allelic types by 
using vivax merozoite surface protein-1 size polymorphism analysis.
