Since the first effort to recombinantly express the hepatitis B core protein
(HBc) in bacteria, the remarkable virion-like structure has fuelled interest in
unraveling the structural and antigenic properties of this protein. Initial
studies proved HBc virus-like particles to possess strong immunogenic properties,
which can be conveyed to linked antigens. More than 35Â years later, numerous
studies have been performed using HBc as a carrier protein for antigens derived
from over a dozen different pathogens and diseases. In this review, the authors
highlight the intriguing features of HBc as carrier and antigen, illustrated by
some examples and experimental results that underscore the value of HBc as an
antigen-presenting platform. Two of these HBc fusions, targeting influenza A and 
malaria, have even progressed into clinical testing. In the future, the HBc-based
virus-like particles platform will probably continue to be used for the display
of poorly immunogenic antigens, mainly because virus-like particle formation by
HBc capsomers is compatible with nearly any available recombinant gene expression
system.
