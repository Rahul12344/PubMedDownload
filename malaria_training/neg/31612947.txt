Invasive insect species can act as a plague across the globe, capable of vast
expansion and rapid, proliferate reproduction. The spread of pathogens of serious
diseases such as malaria and Zika virus and damages to agricultural crops number 
some of the afflictions invasive insects provide to humans alone. Additionally,
an escape from predators can fail to keep invasive insects in check, providing
potential threats such as extra resource competition to native species when
insects invade. A variety of methods are employed to combat these invasive
species, each with their own varying levels of success. Here, we explore the more
traditional methods of invasive insect pest control, such as pesticides and
biological control. In lieu of several unintended consequences resulting from
such practices, we suggest some should be abandoned. We evaluate the potential of
new techniques, in particular, those with a genetic component, regarding the
costs, benefits and possible consequences of implementing them. And finally, we
consider which techniques should be the focus of future research, if we truly
wish to manage or even eradicate invasive insects in their introduced lands.
