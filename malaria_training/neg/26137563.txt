BACKGROUND: Clinicians reported an increasing trend of rapid progression (RP)
(AIDS within 3 years of infection) in Cuba.
METHODS: Recently infected patients were prospectively sampled, 52 RP at AIDS
diagnosis (AIDS-RP) and 21 without AIDS in the same time frame (non-AIDS). 22
patients were sampled at AIDS diagnosis (chronic-AIDS) retrospectively assessed
as > 3 years infected. Clinical, demographic, virological, epidemiological and
immunological data were collected. Pol and env sequences were used for subtyping,
transmission cluster analysis, and prediction of resistance, co-receptor use and 
evolutionary fitness. Host, immunological and viral predictors of RP were
explored through data mining.
FINDINGS: Subtyping revealed 26 subtype B strains, 6 C, 6 CRF18_cpx, 9 CRF19_cpx,
29 BG-recombinants and other subtypes/URFs. All patients infected with CRF19
belonged to the AIDS-RP group. Data mining identified CRF19, oral candidiasis and
RANTES levels as the strongest predictors of AIDS-RP. CRF19 was more frequently
predicted to use the CXCR4 co-receptor, had higher fitness scores in the protease
region, and patients had higher viral load at diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION: CRF19 is a recombinant of subtype D (C-part of Gag, PR, RT and
nef), subtype A (N-part of Gag, Integrase, Env) and subtype G (Vif, Vpr, Vpu and 
C-part of Env). Since subtypes D and A have been associated with respectively
faster and slower disease progression, our findings might indicate a fit PR
driving high viral load, which in combination with co-infections may boost RANTES
levels and thus CXCR4 use, potentially explaining the fast progression. We
propose that CRF19 is evolutionary very fit and causing rapid progression to AIDS
in many newly infected patients in Cuba.
