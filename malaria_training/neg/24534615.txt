During the last decade, a vast number of inhibitors, ligands and fluorescent
probes have evolved for mammalian protein kinases; however, the suitability of
these compounds for studies of evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes has mostly
been left beyond the scope of research. Here, we examined whether adenosine
analogue-oligoarginine conjugates that had been extensively characterized as
efficient inhibitors of the human protein kinases are applicable for targeting
Plasmodium protein kinases. We demonstrated that ARCs were not only able to bind 
to and inhibit a representative member of Plasmodium falciparum kinome
(cGMP-dependent protein kinase) in biochemical assay, but also affected the
general phosphorylation levels in parasites released from the infected red blood 
cells upon saponin treatment. These findings urge advantaging of already existing
biochemical tools, whose initially generic, but intrinsically "tunable"
selectivity profiles could be used for dissection of signaling pathways outside
the initially defined group of biological targets.
