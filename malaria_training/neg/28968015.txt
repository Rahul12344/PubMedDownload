INTRODUCTION: Due to Plasmodium resistance to antimalarial drugs, it is important
to find new therapeutic alternatives for malaria treatment and control. Based on 
the knowledge of Colombian indigenous communities, we collected extracts of
plants with potential antimalarial effects from the middle Vaupés region.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects, as well as the gene
expression of Rad51C, Xiap, P53 and Nrf2 induced by four ethanolic extracts with 
antimalarial activity (R001, T002, T015 and T028).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated four ethanolic extracts with antimalarial
activity using the Ames test to assess mutagenicity, and the comet assay on HepG2
cells to determine the genotoxicicity. We also evaluated the expression of
Rad51C, Xiap, P53 and Nrf2 from HepG2 cells stimulated with the four extracts.
RESULTS: None of the four extracts was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98
strain in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activity. Extracts R001, T015 
and T028 were weakly mutagenic on the TA100 strain in the presence of S9, with
mutagenic indexes (MI) of 1.58, 1.53 and 1.61, respectively. The T015 strain
showed the same behavior without S9 with an MI of 1.36. The results of the comet 
assay showed that the four extracts produced category 1 or 2 damage, with comets 
between 36.7 and 51.48 μm in length. However, the genetic damage index suggested 
that most of the cells were affected by the treatments. Regarding gene
expression, extracts R001 and T028 induced an overexpression of genes Xiap and
P53 with an 1.84 to 3.99 fold-change compared with untreated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that the T002 extract was the safest as it
had antimalarial activity and was not cytotoxic on HepG2 cells. Moreover, it was 
not mutagenic and it only produced category 1 damage on the DNA. Also, the
extract did not induce a change in the expression of the tested genes.
