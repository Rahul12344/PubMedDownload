Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have been used extensively in recent
years to study the functional role of histone marks, variant histones, and other 
chromatin factors in gene expression in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium
falciparum. In this chapter, we present a ChIP-sequencing protocol optimized for 
blood-stage forms of this parasite. The processing of the immunoprecipitated DNA 
prior to high-throughput sequencing is performed in a way to minimize
amplification biases due to the high genomic AT-content of the parasite.
