Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin
America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper
cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections.
The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may
already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early
stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone
epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. Through comparisons with
recently published proteomic data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study found
that although highly transcribed, transcripts associated with functions needed
for early infection of the vertebrate host are not detectable as proteins and may
be regulated through translational repression. We identified differential
transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual
blood stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons
point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and
post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser
extent hypnozoites, but are largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or
mixed blood stages. We also characterised histone epigenetic modifications in the
P. vivax sporozoite and explored their role in regulating transcription.
Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite is a tightly 
programmed stage to infect the human host and identify mechanisms for hypnozoite 
formation that may be further explored in liver stage models.
