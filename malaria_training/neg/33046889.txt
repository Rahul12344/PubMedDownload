The dynamics of CD4+ T cell memory development remain to be examined at genome
scale. In malaria-endemic regions, antimalarial chemoprevention protects long
after its cessation and associates with effects on CD4+ T cells. We applied
single-cell RNA sequencing and computational modelling to track memory
development during Plasmodium infection and treatment. In the absence of central 
memory precursors, two trajectories developed as T helper 1 (TH1) and follicular 
helper T (TFH) transcriptomes contracted and partially coalesced over three
weeks. Progeny of single clones populated TH1 and TFH trajectories, and
fate-mapping suggested that there was minimal lineage plasticity. Relationships
between TFH and central memory were revealed, with antimalarials modulating these
responses and boosting TH1 recall. Finally, single-cell epigenomics confirmed
that heterogeneity among effectors was partially reset in memory. Thus, the
effector-to-memory transition in CD4+ T cells is gradual during malaria and is
modulated by antiparasitic drugs. Graphical user interfaces are presented for
examining gene-expression dynamics and gene-gene correlations (
