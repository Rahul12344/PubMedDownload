Experiments demonstrating the feasibility of genetically modifying mosquito
vectors to impair their ability to transmit the malaria parasite have been known 
for well over a decade. However, means to spread resistance or population control
genes into wild mosquito populations remains an unsolved challenge. Two recent
reports give hope that CRISPR technology may allow such challenge to be overcome.
