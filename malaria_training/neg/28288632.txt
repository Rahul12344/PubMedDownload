BACKGROUND: To assess the effect on malaria prevalence, village specific monthly 
administrations of pyrimethamine, chlorproguanil, chloroquine or placebo were
given to children in four previously treatment-naïve Liberian villages, 1976-78. 
Plasmodium falciparum in vivo resistance developed to pyrimethamine only.
Selection of molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance after 2 years of
treatment are reported.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 191 study children in a survey in
1978. Polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmrp1 and pfnhe1 genes
were determined using PCR-based methods.
RESULTS: Pfcrt 72-76 CVIET was found in one chloroquine village sample, all
remaining samples had pfcrt CVMNK. Pfmdr1 N86 prevalence was 100%. A pfmdr1
T1069ACT→ACG synonymous polymorphism was found in 30% of chloroquine village
samples and 3% of other samples (P = 0.008). Variations in pfnhe1 block I were
found in all except the chloroquine treated village (P < 0.001). Resistance
associated pfdhfr 108N prevalence was 2% in the pyrimethamine village compared to
45-65% elsewhere, including the placebo village (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine treatment possibly resulted in the development of pfcrt 
72-76 CVIET. Selection of pfmdr1 T1069ACG and a pfnhe1 block 1 genotypes
indicates that chloroquine treatment exerted a selective pressure on P.
falciparum. Pyrimethamine resistance associated pfdhfr 108N was present prior to 
the introduction of any drug. Decreased pfdhfr 108N frequency concurrent with
development of pyrimethamine resistance suggests a non-pfdhfr polymorphisms
mediated resistance mechanism.
