Pyruvate kinase (PKLR) is a critical erythrocyte enzyme that is required for
glycolysis and production of ATP. We have shown that Pklr deficiency in mice
reduces the severity (reduced parasitemia, increased survival) of blood stage
malaria induced by infection with Plasmodium chabaudi AS. Likewise, studies in
human erythrocytes infected ex vivo with P. falciparum show that presence of host
PK-deficiency alleles reduces infection phenotypes. We have characterized the
genetic diversity of the PKLR gene, including haplotype structure and presence of
rare coding variants in two populations from malaria endemic areas of Thailand
and Senegal. We investigated the effect of PKLR genotypes on rich longitudinal
datasets including haematological and malaria-associated phenotypes. A coding and
possibly damaging variant (R41Q) was identified in the Thai population with a
minor allele frequency of ~4.7%. Arginine 41 (R41) is highly conserved in the
pyruvate kinase family and its substitution to Glutamine (R41Q) affects protein
stability. Heterozygosity for R41Q is shown to be associated with a significant
reduction in the number of attacks with Plasmodium falciparum, while correlating 
with an increased number of Plasmodium vivax infections. These results strongly
suggest that PKLR protein variants may affect the frequency, and the intensity of
malaria episodes induced by different Plasmodium parasites in humans living in
areas of endemic malaria.
