DNA vaccines offer cost, flexibility, and stability advantages, but administered 
alone have limited immunogenicity. Previously, we identified optimal
configurations of magnetic vectors comprising superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (SPIONs), polyethylenimine (PEI), and hyaluronic acid (HA) to
deliver malaria DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii (Py) merozoite surface protein
MSP119 (SPIONs/PEI/DNA + HA gene complex) to dendritic cells and transfect them
with high efficiency in vitro. Herein, we evaluate their immunogenicity in vivo
by administering these potential vaccine complexes into BALB/c mice. The
complexes induced antibodies against PyMSP119, with higher responses induced
intraperitoneally than intramuscularly, and antibody levels further enhanced by
applying an external magnetic field. The predominant IgG subclasses induced were 
IgG2a followed by IgG1 and IgG2b. The complexes further elicited high levels of
interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), and moderate levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17
antigen-specific splenocytes, indicating induction of T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and 
Th17 cell mediated immunity. The ability of such DNA/nanoparticle complexes to
induce cytophilic antibodies together with broad spectrum cellular immunity may
benefit malaria vaccines.
