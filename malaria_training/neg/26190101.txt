Invading pathogens trigger specific host responses, an understanding of which
might identify genes that function in pathogen recognition and elimination. In
this study, we performed trans-species expression quantitative trait locus
(ts-eQTL) analysis using genotypes of the Plasmodium yoelii malaria parasite and 
phenotypes of mouse gene expression. We significantly linked 1,054 host genes to 
parasite genetic loci (LOD score ≥ 3.0). Using LOD score patterns, which produced
results that differed from direct expression-level clustering, we grouped
host genes that function in related pathways, allowing functional prediction of
unknown genes. As a proof of principle, 14 of 15 randomly selected
genes predicted to function in type I interferon (IFN-I) responses were
experimentally validated using overexpression, small hairpin RNA knockdown, viral
infection, and/or infection of knockout mice. This study demonstrates an
effective strategy for studying gene function, establishes a functional gene
database, and identifies regulators in IFN-I pathways.
