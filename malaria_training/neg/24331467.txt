Cytosine DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark in most eukaryotic cells that
regulates numerous processes, including gene expression and stress responses. We 
performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in the human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. We mapped the positions of methylated cytosines and
identified a single functional DNA methyltransferase (Plasmodium falciparum DNA
methyltransferase; PfDNMT) that may mediate these genomic modifications. These
analyses revealed that the malaria genome is asymmetrically methylated and shares
common features with undifferentiated plant and mammalian cells. Notably, core
promoters are hypomethylated, and transcript levels correlate with intraexonic
methylation. Additionally, there are sharp methylation transitions at nucleosome 
and exon-intron boundaries. These data suggest that DNA methylation could
regulate virulence gene expression and transcription elongation. Furthermore, the
broad range of action of DNA methylation and the uniqueness of PfDNMT suggest
that the methylation pathway is a potential target for antimalarial strategies.
