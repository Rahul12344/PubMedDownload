Children are highly susceptible to clinical malaria, and in regions where malaria
is endemic, their immune systems must face successive encounters with Plasmodium 
falciparum parasites before they develop immunity, first against severe disease
and later against uncomplicated malaria. Understanding cellular and molecular
interactions between host and parasites during an infection could provide
insights into the processes underlying this gradual acquisition of immunity, as
well as to how parasites adapt to infect hosts that are successively more malaria
experienced. Here, we describe methods to analyze the host and parasite gene
expression profiles generated simultaneously from blood samples collected from
five consecutive symptomatic P. falciparum infections in three Malian children.
We show that the data generated enable statistical assessment of the proportions 
of (i) each white blood cell subset and (ii) the parasite developmental stages,
as well as investigations of host-parasite gene coexpression. We also use the
sequences generated to analyze allelic variations in transcribed regions and
determine the complexity of each infection. While limited by the modest sample
size, our analyses suggest that host gene expression profiles primarily clustered
by individual, while the parasite gene expression profiles seemed to
differentiate early from late infections. Overall, this study provides a solid
framework to examine the mechanisms underlying acquisition of immunity to malaria
infections using whole-blood transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).IMPORTANCE We
show that dual RNA-seq from patient blood samples allows characterization of
host/parasite interactions during malaria infections and can provide a solid
framework to study the acquisition of antimalarial immunity, as well as the
adaptations of P. falciparum to malaria-experienced hosts.
