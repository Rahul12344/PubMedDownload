Both host and parasite factors contribute to disease severity of malaria
infection; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the disease and the 
host-parasite interactions involved remain largely unresolved. To investigate the
effects of parasite factors on host immune responses and pathogenesis, we
measured levels of plasma cytokines/chemokines (CCs) and growth rates in mice
infected with two Plasmodium yoelii strains having different virulence phenotypes
and in progeny from a genetic cross of the two parasites. Quantitative trait loci
(QTL) analysis linked levels of many CCs, particularly IL-1β, IP-10, IFN-γ, MCP-1
and MIG, and early parasite growth rate to loci on multiple parasite chromosomes,
including chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13. Comparison of the genome sequences
spanning the mapped loci revealed various candidate genes. The loci on
chromosomes 7 and 13 had significant (P<0.005) additive effects on IL-1β, IL-5
and IP-10 responses, and the chromosome 9 and 12 loci had significant (P=0.017)
interaction. Infection of knockout mice showed critical roles of MCP-1 and IL-10 
in parasitemia control and host mortality. These results provide important
information for a better understanding of malaria pathogenesis and can be used to
examine the role of these factors in human malaria infection.
