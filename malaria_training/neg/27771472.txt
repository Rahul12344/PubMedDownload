α-Thalassemia (α-thal) is among the world's most common single gene disorders,
generally attributed to a selective advantage of heterozygotes against malaria
mortality. A high frequency of -α3.7 deletion heterozygosity has been previously 
reported in Ashkenazi Jews despite lack of obvious malarial selection pressure in
this population. Using haplotype and -α3.7 subtype analysis we analyzed a subset 
of -α3.7 homozygotes from various Israeli ethnic groups. We found a high
frequency of the common Ia haplotype in Yemenite Jews and Arabs (54% and 13%
respectively). Ashkenazi Jews exhibited a high frequency of IIIb alleles (67%)
previously reported only in Aboriginal Australians and not found in other Israeli
ethnicities. Both Yemenites and Ashkenazim carried the rare IIh alleles (18% and 
15% respectively). These results may suggest multiple founder effects in
Ashkenazi Jews as well a common founder for both Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jews.
