Plasmodium cynomolgi is a malaria parasite that typically infects Asian macaque
monkeys, and humans on rare occasions. P. cynomolgi serves as a model system for 
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax, with which it shares such important 
biological characteristics as formation of a dormant liver stage and a preference
to invade reticulocytes. While genomes of three P. cynomolgi strains have been
sequenced, genetic diversity of P. cynomolgi has not been widely investigated. To
address this we developed the first panel of P. cynomolgi microsatellite markers 
to genotype eleven P. cynomolgi laboratory strains and 18 field isolates from
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We found diverse genotypes among most of the
laboratory strains, though two nominally different strains were found to be
genetically identical. We also investigated sequence polymorphism in two
erythrocyte invasion gene families, the reticulocyte binding protein and Duffy
binding protein genes, in these strains. We also observed copy number variation
in rbp genes.
