BACKGROUND: Rickettsia felis is a common emerging pathogen detected in mosquitoes
in sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that, as with malaria, great apes may be
exposed to the infectious bite of infected mosquitoes and release R. felis DNA in
their feces.
METHODS: We conducted a study of 17 forest sites in Central Africa, testing 1,028
fecal samples from 313 chimpanzees, 430 gorillas and 285 bonobos. The presence of
rickettsial DNA was investigated by specific quantitative real-time PCR. Positive
results were confirmed by a second PCR using primers and a probe targeting a
specific gene for R. felis. All positive samples were sequenced.
RESULTS: Overall, 113 samples (11%) were positive for the Rickettsia-specific
gltA gene, including 25 (22%) that were positive for R. felis. The citrate
synthase (gltA) sequence and outer membrane protein A (ompA) sequence analysis
indicated 99% identity at the nucleotide level to R. felis. The 88 other samples 
(78%) were negative using R. felis-specific qPCR and were compatible with R.
felis-like organisms.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, we detected R. felis in wild-living ape feces.
This non invasive detection of human pathogens in endangered species opens up new
possibilities in the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary analysis of
infectious diseases, beside HIV and malaria.
