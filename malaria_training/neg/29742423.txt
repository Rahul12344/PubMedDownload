Cancer stem cells promote neoplastic growth, in part by deregulating asymmetric
cell division and enhancing self-renewal. To uncover mechanisms and potential
therapeutic targets in glioma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal, we performed a
genetic suppressor screen for kinases to reverse the tumor phenotype of our
Drosophila brain tumor model and identified dCdk5 as a critical regulator. CDK5, 
the human ortholog of dCdk5 (79% identity), is aberrantly activated in GBMs and
tightly aligned with both chromosome 7 gains and stem cell markers affecting
tumor-propagation. Our investigation revealed that pharmaceutical inhibition of
CDK5 prevents GSC self-renewal in vitro and in xenografted tumors, at least
partially by suppressing CREB1 activation independently of PKA/cAMP. Finally, our
TCGA GBM data analysis revealed that CDK5, stem cell, and asymmetric cell
division markers segregate within non-mesenchymal patient clusters, which may
indicate preferential dependence on CDK5 signaling and sensitivity to its
inhibition in this group.
