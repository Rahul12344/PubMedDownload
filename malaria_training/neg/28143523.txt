BACKGROUND: Ticks attach to and penetrate their hosts' skin and inactivate
multiple components of host responses in order to acquire a blood meal.
Infestation loads with the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, are heritable:
some breeds carry high loads of reproductively successful ticks, whereas in
others, few ticks feed and reproduce efficiently.
METHODS: In order to elucidate the mechanisms that result in the different
outcomes of infestations with cattle ticks, we examined global gene expression
and inflammation induced by tick bites in skins from one resistant and one
susceptible breed of cattle that underwent primary infestations with larvae and
nymphs of R. microplus. We also examined the expression profiles of genes
encoding secreted tick proteins that mediate parasitism in larvae and nymphs
feeding on these breeds.
RESULTS: Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes in the skin
suggest that allergic contact-like dermatitis develops with ensuing production of
IL-6, CXCL-8 and CCL-2 and is sustained by HMGB1, ISG15 and PKR, leading to
expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that recruit granulocytes
and T lymphocytes. Importantly, this response is delayed in susceptible hosts.
Histopathological analyses of infested skins showed inflammatory reactions
surrounding tick cement cones that enable attachment in both breeds, but in
genetically tick-resistant bovines they destabilized the cone. The transcription 
data provided insights into tick-mediated activation of basophils, which have
previously been shown to be a key to host resistance in model systems. Skin from 
tick-susceptible bovines expressed more transcripts encoding enzymes that
detoxify tissues. Interestingly, these enzymes also produce volatile odoriferous 
compounds and, accordingly, skin rubbings from tick-susceptible bovines attracted
significantly more tick larvae than rubbings from resistant hosts. Moreover,
transcripts encoding secreted modulatory molecules by the tick were significantly
more abundant in larval and in nymphal salivary glands from ticks feeding on
susceptible bovines.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with tick-susceptible hosts, genes encoding enzymes
producing volatile compounds exhibit significantly lower expression in resistant 
hosts, which may render them less attractive to larvae; resistant hosts expose
ticks to an earlier inflammatory response, which in ticks is associated with
significantly lower expression of genes encoding salivary proteins that suppress 
host immunity, inflammation and coagulation.
