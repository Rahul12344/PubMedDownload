BACKGROUND: Over the course of its intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC),
the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum tightly orchestrates the rise and fall
of transcript levels for hundreds of genes. Considerable debate has focused on
the relative importance of transcriptional versus post-transcriptional processes 
in the regulation of transcript levels. Enzymatically active forms of RNAPII in
other organisms have been associated with phosphorylation on the serines at
positions 2 and 5 of the heptad repeats within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of
RNAPII. We reasoned that insight into the contribution of transcriptional
mechanisms to gene expression in P. falciparum could be obtained by comparing the
presence of enzymatically active forms of RNAPII at multiple genes with the
abundance of their associated transcripts.
RESULTS: We exploited the phosphorylation state of the CTD to detect
enzymatically active forms of RNAPII at most P. falciparum genes across the IDC. 
We raised highly specific monoclonal antibodies against three forms of the
parasite CTD, namely unphosphorylated, Ser5-P and Ser2/5-P, and used these in
ChIP-on-chip type experiments to map the genome-wide occupancy of RNAPII. Our
data reveal that the IDC is divided into early and late phases of RNAPII
occupancy evident from simple bi-phasic RNAPII binding profiles. By comparison to
mRNA abundance, we identified sub-sets of genes with high occupancy by
enzymatically active forms of RNAPII and relatively low transcript levels and
vice versa. We further show that the presence of active and repressive histone
modifications correlates with RNAPII occupancy over the IDC.
CONCLUSIONS: The simple early/late occupancy by RNAPII cannot account for the
complex dynamics of mRNA accumulation over the IDC, suggesting a major role for
mechanisms acting downstream of RNAPII occupancy in the control of gene
expression in this parasite.
