Malaria is caused by mosquito-borne Plasmodium spp. parasites that must infect
and survive within mosquito salivary glands (SGs) prior to host transmission.
Recent advances in transcriptomics and the complete genome sequencing of mosquito
vectors have increased our knowledge of the SG genes and proteins involved in
pathogen infection and transmission. Membrane solute carriers are key proteins
involved in drug transport and are useful in the development of new interventions
for transmission blocking. Herein, we applied transcriptomics analysis to compare
SGs mRNA levels in Anopheles stephensi fed on non-infected and P.
berghei-infected mice. The A. stephensi solute carriers prestinA and NDAE1 were
up-regulated in response to infection. These molecules are predicted to interact 
with each other, and are reportedly involved in the maintenance of cell
homeostasis. To further evaluate their functions in mosquito survival and
parasite infection, these genes were knocked down by RNA interference. Knockdown 
of prestinA and NDAE1 resulted in reduction of the number of sporozoites in
mosquito SGs. Moreover, NDAE1 knockdown strongly impacted mosquito survival,
resulting in the death of half of the treated mosquitoes. Overall, our findings
indicate the importance of prestinA and NDAE1 in interactions between mosquito
SGs and Plasmodium, and suggest the need for further research.
