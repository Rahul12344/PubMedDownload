PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a need for improved diagnosis and for optimal
classification of patients with infectious diseases. An alternative approach to
the pathogen-detection strategy is based on a comprehensive analysis of the host 
response to the infection. This review focuses on the value of transcriptome
analyses of blood leukocytes for the diagnosis and management of patients with
infectious diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Initial studies showed that RNA from blood leukocytes of
children with acute viral and bacterial infections carried pathogen-specific
transcriptional signatures. Subsequently, transcriptional signatures for several 
other infections have been described and validated in humans with malaria,
dengue, salmonella, melioidosis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza,
tuberculosis, and HIV. In addition, transcriptome analyses represent an
invaluable tool to understand disease pathogenesis and to objectively classify
patients according to the clinical severity.
SUMMARY: Microarray studies have been shown to be highly reproducible using
different platforms, and in different patient populations, confirming the value
of blood transcriptome analyses to study pathogen-specific host immune responses 
in the clinical setting. Combining the detection of the pathogen with a
comprehensive assessment of the host immune response will provide a new
understanding of the correlations between specific causative agents, the host
response, and the clinical manifestations of the disease.
