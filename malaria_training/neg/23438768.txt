Anti-malaria interventions that rely on insecticides can be compromised by
insecticide-resistance alleles among malaria vectors. We examined frequency
changes of resistance alleles at two loci, knockdown resistance (kdr) and
acetylcholinesterase-1 (ace-1), which confer resistance to pyrethroids and DDT,
and carbamates, respectively. A total of 7,059 Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto
mosquitoes were analyzed from multiple sites across continental Equatorial
Guinea. A subset of sites included samples collected pre-intervention (2007) and 
post-intervention (2009-2011). Both L1014S and L1014F resistance alleles were
observed in almost all pre-intervention collections. In particular, L1014F was
already at substantial frequencies in M form populations (17.6-74.6%), and at
high frequencies (> 50%) in all but two S form populations. Comparison before and
throughout anti-vector interventions showed drastic increases in L1014F,
presumably caused by intensified selection pressure imposed by pyrethroids used
in vector control efforts. In light of these findings, inclusion of other
insecticide classes in any anti-vector intervention can be considered prudent.
