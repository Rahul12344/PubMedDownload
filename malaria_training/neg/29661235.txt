BACKGROUND: Genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) are the targets of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) present in
artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT; artesunate + sulfadoxine
pyrimethamine) for Plasmodium falciparum. Although SP is generally not used to
treat vivax infection, mutations in dhfr and dhps that confer antifolate
resistance in Plasmodium vivax are common; which may be attributed to its
sympatric existence with P. falciparum. Current study was aimed to determine the 
pattern of mutations in dhfr and dhps in P. vivax isolates from Mangaluru region.
METHODS: A total of 140 blood samples were collected from P. vivax-infected
people attending Wenlock Hospital Mangaluru during July 2014 to January 2016. Out
of 140 isolates, 25 (18%) and 50 (36%) isolates were selected randomly for
sequence analysis of pvdhfr and pvdhps genes respectively. Fragment of pvdhps and
full length pvdhfr were amplified, sequenced and analysed for single nucleotide
polymorphisms. dhps was analysed by PCR-RFLP also, to detect the two specific
mutations (A383G and A553G).
RESULTS: Analysis of pvdhps sequences from 50 isolates revealed single and double
mutants at 38 and 46% respectively. Three non-synonymous mutations (K55R, S58R
and S117N) were identified for pvdhfr. Among these, K55R was detected for the
first time.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that P. vivax dhps and dhfr mutant
alleles are prevalent in this area, suggesting significant SP pressure.
