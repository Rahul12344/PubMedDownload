BACKGROUND: Despite several control interventions resulting in a considerable
decrease in malaria prevalence in the Union of the Comoros, the disease remains a
public health problem with high transmission in Grande Comore compared to
neighbouring islands. In this country, only a few studies investigating the
genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum have been performed so far. For this
reason, this study aims to examine the genetic diversity of P. falciparum by
studying samples collected in Grande Comore in 2012 and 2013, using merozoite
surface protein 1 (msp1), merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers.
METHODS: A total of 162 positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) samples from Grande 
Comore were used to extract parasite DNA. Allelic families K1, Mad20 and RO33 of 
the msp1 gene as well as allelic families IC3D7 and FC37 of the msp2 gene were
determined by using nested PCR. Additionally, 50 out of 151 samples were
genotyped to study 24 SNPs by using high resolution melting (HRM).
RESULTS: Two allelic families were predominant, the K1 family of msp1 gene (55%) 
and the FC27 family of msp2 gene (47.4%). Among 50 samples genotyped for 24 SNPs,
42 (84%) yielded interpretable results. Out of these isolates, 36 (85%) were
genetically unique and 6 (15%) grouped into two clusters. The genetic diversity
of P. falciparum calculated from msp1 and msp2 genes and SNPs was 0.82 and 0.61, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: In summary, a large genetic diversity of P. falciparum was observed
in Grande Comore. This may favour persistence of malaria and might be one of the 
reasons for the high malaria transmission compared to neighbouring islands.
Further surveillance of P. falciparum isolates, mainly through environmental
management and vector control, is warranted until complete elimination is
attained.
