OBJECTIVE: To analyse the var gene repertoire and characterise the chondroitin
sulphate A (CSA)-binding activity of the Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains encoded
by the var2csa gene of a Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolate in Hainan 
Province, China.
METHODS: The sequences of var DBL1 regions were PCR-amplified, sequenced and the 
sequence characteristics was bioinformatically analysed. Recombinant proteins
encoded by the var2csa genes were expressed and purified. The binding activities 
of the recombinant proteins to CSA receptor was detected by ELISA assays.
RESULTS: Fifty six unique DBL α sequences were obtained, and the sequences
represented similar diversity to the var genes of the genome parasite 3D7. There 
are two var2csa genes in the P. falciparum isolated from Hainan Province. Unlike 
in other falciparum parasites such as HB3, the two var2csa genes are more
diverged. The receptor-binding capacity of DBL-5ε and DBL-6ε domains of HN
var2CSA was studied.
CONCLUSIONS: This work represented the diversity of var genes of a P. falciparum 
isolate in China.
