Transgenesis is an essential tool to investigate gene function and to introduce
desired characters in laboratory organisms. Setting-up transgenesis in non-model 
organisms is challenging due to the diversity of biological life traits and due
to knowledge gaps in genomic information. Some procedures will be broadly
applicable to many organisms, and others have to be specifically developed for
the target species. Transgenesis in disease vector mosquitoes has existed since
the 2000s but has remained limited by the delicate biology of these insects.
Here, we report a compilation of the transgenesis tools that we have designed for
the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, including new docking strains, convenient
transgenesis plasmids, a puromycin resistance selection marker, mosquitoes
expressing cre recombinase, and various reporter lines defining the activity of
cloned promoters. This toolbox contributed to rendering transgenesis routine in
this species and is now enabling the development of increasingly refined genetic 
manipulations such as targeted mutagenesis. Some of the reagents and procedures
reported here are easily transferable to other nonmodel species, including other 
disease vector or agricultural pest insects.
