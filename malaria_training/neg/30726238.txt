Endosymbiosis has driven major molecular and cellular innovations. Plasmodium
spp. parasites that cause malaria contain an essential, non-photosynthetic
plastid-the apicoplast-which originated from a secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote)
endosymbiosis. To discover organellar pathways with evolutionary and biomedical
significance, we performed a mutagenesis screen for essential genes required for 
apicoplast biogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum. Apicoplast(-) mutants were
isolated using a chemical rescue that permits conditional disruption of the
apicoplast and a new fluorescent reporter for organelle loss. Five candidate
genes were validated (out of 12 identified), including a triosephosphate
isomerase (TIM)-barrel protein that likely derived from a core metabolic enzyme
but evolved a new activity. Our results demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first 
forward genetic screen to assign essential cellular functions to unannotated P.
falciparum genes. A putative TIM-barrel enzyme and other newly identified
apicoplast biogenesis proteins open opportunities to discover new mechanisms of
organelle biogenesis, molecular evolution underlying eukaryotic diversity, and
drug targets against multiple parasitic diseases.
