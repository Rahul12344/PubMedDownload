BACKGROUND: The movement of malaria vectors into new areas is a growing concern
in the efforts to control malaria. The recent report of Anopheles stephensi in
eastern Ethiopia has raised the necessity to understand the insecticide
resistance status of the vector in the region to better inform vector-based
interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate insecticide resistance in
An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia using two approaches: (1) World Health
Organization (WHO) bioassay tests in An. stephensi; and (2) genetic analysis of
insecticide resistance genes in An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia.
METHODS: Mosquito larvae and pupae were collected from Kebri Dehar. Insecticide
susceptibility of An. stephensi was tested with malathion 5%, bendiocarb 0.1%,
propoxur 0.1%, deltamethrin 0.05%, permethrin 0.75%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25% and 
DDT 4%, according to WHO standard protocols. In this study, the knockdown
resistance locus (kdr) in the voltage gated sodium channel (vgsc) and ace1R locus
in the acetylcholinesterase gene (ace-1) were analysed in An. stephensi.
RESULTS: All An. stephensi samples were resistant to carbamates, with mortality
rates of 23% and 21% for bendiocarb and propoxur, respectively. Adult An.
stephensi was also resistant to pyrethroid insecticides with mortality rates 67% 
for deltamethrin and 53% for permethrin. Resistance to DDT and malathion was
detected in An. stephensi with mortality rates of 32% as well as An. stephensi
was resistance to pirimiphos-methyl with mortality rates 14%. Analysis of the
insecticide resistance loci revealed the absence of kdr L1014F and L1014S
mutations and the ace1R G119S mutation.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings support that An. stephensi is resistant to
several classes of insecticides, most notably pyrethroids. However, the absence
of the kdr L1014 gene may suggest non-target site resistance mechanisms.
Continuous insecticide resistance monitoring should be carried out in the region 
to confirm the documented resistance and exploring mechanisms conferring
resistance in An. stephensi in Ethiopia.
