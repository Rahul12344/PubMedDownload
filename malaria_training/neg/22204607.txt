In a recent paper, we have described the discovery of antimalarial compounds
derived from tadalafil, using a drug-to-genome-to-drug approach ( J. Med. Chem.
2011 , 54 ( 9 ), pp 3222 - 3240 ). We have shown that these derivatives inhibit
the phosphodiesterase activity of Plasmodium falciparum and the parasite growth
in culture. In this paper, we describe the optimization of these compounds. A
direct consequence of our approach based on gene orthology is the lack of
selectivity of the compounds over the original activity on the human target. We
demonstrate here that it is possible to take advantage of subtle differences in
SAR between HsPDE5 inhibition and antiplasmodial activity to improve
significantly the selectivity. In particular, the replacement of the piperonyl
group in compound 2 by a dimethoxyphenyl group was the best way to optimize
selectivity. This observation is consistent with the differences between human
and plasmodial sequences in the Q2 pocket receiving this group.
