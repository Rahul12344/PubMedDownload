Cambodia's first-line artemisinin combination therapy,
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), is no longer sufficiently curative
against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria at some Thai-Cambodian 
border regions. We report recent (2008 to 2013) drug resistance trends in 753
isolates from northern, western, and southern Cambodia by surveying for ex vivo
drug susceptibility and molecular drug resistance markers to guide the selection 
of an effective alternative to DHA-PPQ. Over the last 3 study years, PPQ
susceptibility declined dramatically (geomean 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]
increased from 12.8 to 29.6 nM), while mefloquine (MQ) sensitivity doubled (67.1 
to 26 nM) in northern Cambodia. These changes in drug susceptibility were
significantly associated with a decreased prevalence of P. falciparum multidrug
resistance 1 gene (Pfmdr1) multiple copy isolates and coincided with the timing
of replacing artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) with DHA-PPQ as the first-line
therapy. Widespread chloroquine resistance was suggested by all isolates being of
the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene CVIET haplotype. Nearly
all isolates collected from the most recent years had P. falciparum kelch13
mutations, indicative of artemisinin resistance. Ex vivo bioassay measurements of
antimalarial activity in plasma indicated 20% of patients recently took
antimalarials, and their plasma had activity (median of 49.8 nM DHA equivalents) 
suggestive of substantial in vivo drug pressure. Overall, our findings suggest
DHA-PPQ failures are associated with emerging PPQ resistance in a background of
artemisinin resistance. The observed connection between drug policy changes and
significant reduction in PPQ susceptibility with mitigation of MQ resistance
supports reintroduction of AS-MQ, in conjunction with monitoring of the P.
falciparum mdr1 copy number, as a stop-gap measure in areas of DHA-PPQ failure.
