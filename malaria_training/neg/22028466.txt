Genome-scale screening studies are gradually accumulating a wealth of data on the
putative involvement of hundreds of genes in various cellular responses or
functions. A fundamental challenge is to chart the molecular pathways that
underlie these systems. ANAT is an interactive software tool, implemented as a
Cytoscape plug-in, for elucidating functional networks of proteins. It
encompasses a number of network inference algorithms and provides access to
networks of physical associations in several organisms. In contrast to existing
software tools, ANAT can be used to infer subnetworks that connect hundreds of
proteins to each other or to a given set of "anchor" proteins, a fundamental step
in reconstructing cellular subnetworks. The interactive component of ANAT
provides an array of tools for evaluating and exploring the resulting subnetwork 
models and for iteratively refining them. We demonstrate the utility of ANAT by
studying the crosstalk between the autophagic and apoptotic cell death modules in
humans, using a network of physical interactions. Relative to published software 
tools, ANAT is more accurate and provides more features for comprehensive network
analysis. The latest version of the software is available at
http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~bnet/ANAT_SI.
