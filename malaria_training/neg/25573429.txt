The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses sophisticated systems 
of protein secretion to modulate host cell invasion and remodeling. In the
present study, we provide insights into the function of the AP-1 complex in P.
falciparum. We utilized GFP fusion constructs for live cell imaging, as well as
fixed parasites in immunofluorescence analysis, to study adaptor protein mu1
(Pfμ1) mediated protein trafficking in P. falciparum. In trophozoites Pfμ1 showed
similar dynamic localization to that of several Golgi/ER markers, indicating
Golgi/ER localization. Treatment of transgenic parasites with Brefeldin A altered
the localization of Golgi-associated Pfμ1, supporting the localization studies.
Co-localization studies showed considerable overlap of Pfμ1 with the resident
rhoptry proteins, rhoptry associated protein 1 (RAP1) and Cytoadherence linked
asexual gene 3.1 (Clag3.1) in schizont stage. Immunoprecipitation experiments
with Pfμ1 and PfRAP1 revealed an interaction, which may be mediated through an
intermediate transmembrane cargo receptor. A specific role for Pfμ1 in
trafficking was suggested by treatment with AlF4, which resulted in a shift to a 
predominantly ER-associated compartment and consequent decrease in
co-localization with the Golgi marker GRASP. Together, these results suggest a
role for the AP-1 complex in rhoptry protein trafficking in P. falciparum.
