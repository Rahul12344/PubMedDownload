Research on gene drive systems is rapidly advancing. Many proposed applications
of gene drive research aim to solve environmental and public health challenges,
including the reduction of poverty and the burden of vector-borne diseases, such 
as malaria and dengue, which disproportionately impact low and middle income
countries. However, due to their intrinsic qualities of rapid spread and
irreversibility, gene drive systems raise many questions with respect to their
safety relative to public and environmental health. Because gene drive systems
are designed to alter the environments we share in ways that will be hard to
anticipate and impossible to completely roll back, questions about the ethics
surrounding use of this research are complex and will require very careful
exploration. Gene Drives on the Horizon outlines the state of knowledge relative 
to the science, ethics, public engagement, and risk assessment as they pertain to
research directions of gene drive systems and governance of the research process.
This report offers principles for responsible practices of gene drive research
and related applications for use by investigators, their institutions, the
research funders, and regulators.
