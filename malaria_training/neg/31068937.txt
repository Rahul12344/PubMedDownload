Malaria is a deadly infectious disease associated with fundamental changes in the
composition of the memory B cell (MBC) compartment, most notably a large
expansion of T-bet+ MBCs, termed atypical MBCs. However, we know little about the
precursors of atypical MBCs and the conditions that drive their differentiation. 
We compared the responses of human tonsil naïve B cells, MBCs, and germinal
center B cells to a variety of stimulatory conditions. We determined that
prolonged antigen presentation in the presence of CpG and IFN-γ induced maximal
expression of T-bet and other phenotypic markers of malaria-associated atypical
MBCs primarily in naïve B cells in vitro. Importantly T-bet+ naïve-derived B
cells resembled atypical MBCs in their hypo-responsiveness to signaling through
their B cell receptors. Thus, naïve B cells can be induced to differentiate into 
phenotypically and functionally atypical-like MBCs in vitro under conditions that
may prevail in chronic infectious diseases in vivo.
