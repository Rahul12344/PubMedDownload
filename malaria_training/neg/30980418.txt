WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Genetic polymorphism is one of the most important
factors responsible for interindividual and interethnic variability in drug
response. Studies in major populations, ie, Caucasians, Asians, and Africans,
have provided evidence of differences in the genotype frequencies of major
drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP). This study aimed to review
systematically, all relevant articles related to the genetic polymorphisms in
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 in South-East and East Asian (SEEA)
populations.
METHODS: Articles that report genetic polymorphisms, genotype frequencies and
allele frequencies in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 were retrieved from the 
PubMed database.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: A total of 86 studies that fulfilled the eligibility
criteria representing different ethnic populations of SEEA, ie, Burmese, Chinese,
Japanese, Karen ethnic minority, Korean, Malaysian, Philippino, Singaporean,
Taiwanese, Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, were included in the analysis. In
general, the genotype frequencies across SEEA populations are comparable. The
CYP2C9*1/*1 (69.3%-99.1%), *1/*3 (2.3%-20.1%) and *3/*3 (0%-2.2%) genotypes are
reported in most SEEA populations. Six major CYP2C19 genotypes, ie, *1/*1
(6.25%-88.07%), *1/*2 (21.5%-86.46%), *1/*3 (0.8%-15.8%), *2/*2 (3.4%-14.5%),
*2/*3 (0%-7.3%) and *3/*3 (0%-10.2%), are reported in most SEEA populations.
Major CYP2D6 genotypes include *10/*10 (0%-69.6%), *1/*1 (0%-61.21%) and *1/*10
(0%-62.0%). Major CYP3A5 genotypes are *3/*3 (2.0%-71.4%), *1/*3 (16.0%-57.1%)
and *1/*1 (0%-82.0%). Genotyping of abnormal genotypes of CYP2C9 (*1/*3), CYP2C19
(*1/*2, *1/*3), CYP3A5 (*1/*3) and CYP2D6 (*5/*10) associated with IM
(Intermediate metabolizer) status, may be clinically beneficial in SEEA
populations. Similarly, with CYP2C19 (*2/*2, *2/*3), CYP2D6 (*5/*5 ) linked to PM
(Poor metabolizer), CYP2D6 (*10/*10, *1/*5 and to lesser extent *1/*4, *2/*5,
*10/*41, *10/*49, *10/*14) and CYP3A5 (*1/*1) associated with EM (extensive
metabolizer).
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Sufficient number of studies has provided comparable 
results in general. This review suggests that comparable genotype frequencies of 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 exist among the SEEA populations. It is noted 
that more research data are reported from East Asians compared with South-East
Asians. Concerned efforts are required to establish partnerships among SEEA
countries that will ensure sufficient data from South-East Asian countries which 
will assist in establishing the databases for SEEA populations.
