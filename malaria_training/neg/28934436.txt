We have developed a serologically based immunophenotyping approach to study
Onchocerca volvulus (Ov) population diversity. Using genomic sequence data and
polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping, we identified nonsynonymous
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of 16 major immunogenic Ov
proteins: Ov-CHI-1/Ov-CHI-2, Ov16, Ov-FAR-1, Ov-CPI-1, Ov-B20, Ov-ASP-1,
Ov-TMY-1, OvSOD1, OvGST1, Ov-CAL-1, M3/M4, Ov-RAL-1, Ov-RAL-2, Ov-ALT-1,
Ov-FBA-1, and Ov-B8. We assessed the immunoreactivity of onchocerciasis patient
sera (n = 152) from the Americas, West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa
against peptides derived from 10 of these proteins containing SNPs. Statistically
significant variation in immunoreactivity among the regions was seen in
SNP-containing peptides derived from 8 of 10 proteins tested: OVOC1192(1-15),
OVOC9988(28-42), OVOC9225(320-334), OVOC7453(22-36), OVOC11517(14-28),
OVOC3177(283-297), OVOC7911(594-608), and OVOC12628(174-188). Our data show that 
differences in immunoreactivity to variant antigenic peptides may be used to
characterize Ov populations, thereby elucidating features of Ov population
biology previously inaccessible because of the limited availability of parasite
material.
