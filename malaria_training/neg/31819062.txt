Novel interventions that leverage the heterogeneity of parasite transmission are 
needed to achieve malaria elimination. To better understand spatial and temporal 
dynamics of transmission, we applied amplicon next-generation sequencing of two
polymorphic gene regions (csp and ama1) to a cohort identified via reactive case 
detection in a high-transmission setting in western Kenya. From April 2013 to
July 2014, we enrolled 442 symptomatic children with malaria, 442 matched
controls, and all household members of both groups. Here, we evaluate genetic
similarity between infected individuals using three indices: sharing of parasite 
haplotypes on binary and proportional scales and the L1 norm. Symptomatic
children more commonly share haplotypes with their own household members.
Furthermore, we observe robust temporal structuring of parasite genetic
similarity and identify the unique molecular signature of an outbreak. These
findings of both micro- and macro-scale organization of parasite populations
might be harnessed to inform next-generation malaria control measures.
