BACKGROUND: Anopheles mosquitoes are efficient vectors of human malaria, but it
is unknown why they do not transmit viruses as well as Aedes and Culex
mosquitoes. The only arbovirus known to be consistently transmitted by Anopheles 
mosquitoes is O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV, genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae).
The interaction of Anopheles mosquitoes with RNA viruses has been relatively
unexamined.
RESULTS: We transcriptionally profiled the African malaria vector, Anopheles
coluzzii, infected with ONNV. Mosquitoes were fed on an infectious bloodmeal and 
were analyzed by Illumina RNAseq at 3 days post-bloodmeal during the primary
virus infection of the midgut epithelium, before systemic dissemination. Virus
infection triggers transcriptional regulation of just 30 host candidate genes.
Most of the regulated candidate genes are novel, without known function. Of the
known genes, a significant cluster includes candidates with predicted involvement
in carbohydrate metabolism. Two candidate genes encoding leucine-rich repeat
immune (LRIM) factors point to possible involvement of immune protein complexes
in the mosquito antiviral response. The primary ONNV infection by bloodmeal
shares little transcriptional response in common with ONNV infection by
intrathoracic injection, nor with midgut infection by the malaria parasites,
Plasmodium falciparum or P. berghei. Profiling of A. coluzzii microRNA (miRNA)
identified 118 known miRNAs and 182 potential novel miRNA candidates, with just
one miRNA regulated by ONNV infection. This miRNA was not regulated by other
previously reported treatments, and may be virus specific. Coexpression analysis 
of miRNA abundance and messenger RNA expression revealed discrete clusters of
genes regulated by Imd and JAK/STAT, immune signaling pathways that are
protective against ONNV in the primary infection.
CONCLUSIONS: ONNV infection of the A. coluzzii midgut triggers a remarkably
limited gene regulation program of mostly novel candidate genes, which likely
includes host genes deployed for antiviral defense, as well as genes manipulated 
by the virus to facilitate infection. Functional dissection of the ONNV-response 
candidate genes is expected to generate novel insight into the mechanisms of
virus-vector interaction.
