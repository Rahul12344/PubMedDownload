BACKGROUND: Rhizaria are a major branch of eukaryote evolution with an extensive 
microfossil record, but only scarce molecular data are available. The rhizarian
species Reticulomyxa filosa, belonging to the Foraminifera, is free-living in
freshwater environments. In culture, it thrives only as a plasmodium with
thousands of haploid nuclei in one cell. The R. filosa genome is the first
foraminiferal genome to be deciphered.
RESULTS: The genome is extremely repetitive, and the large amounts of identical
sequences hint at frequent amplifications and homologous recombination events.
Presumably, these mechanisms are employed to provide more gene copies for higher 
transcriptional activity and to build up a reservoir of gene diversification in
certain gene families, such as the kinesin family. The gene repertoire indicates 
that it is able to switch to a single-celled, flagellated sexual state never
observed in culture. Comparison to another rhizarian, the chlorarachniophyte alga
Bigelowiella natans, reveals that proteins involved in signaling were likely
drivers in establishing the Rhizaria lineage. Compared to some other protists,
horizontal gene transfer is limited, but we found evidence of
bacterial-to-eukaryote and eukaryote-to-eukaryote transfer events.
CONCLUSIONS: The R. filosa genome exhibits a unique architecture with extensive
repeat homogenization and gene amplification, which highlights its potential for 
diverse life-cycle stages. The ability of R. filosa to rapidly transport matter
from the pseudopodia to the cell body may be supported by the high
diversification of actin and kinesin gene family members.
