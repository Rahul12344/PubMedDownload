BACKGROUND: The development of an effective malarial vaccine is an urgent need.
Most glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of Plasmodium parasites
are exposed to neutralizing antibodies, and several are advanced vaccine
candidates. In the present study, Plasmodium vivax Pv32 (PVX_084815) as a
hypothetical, predicted GPI-anchored and cysteine-rich motif was identified from 
our previous findings with a focus on its antigenic profiling. The orthologue
gene pv32, a predicted GPI anchor of P. falciparum PF3D7_1434400, has still not
been well studied.
METHODS: The gene information of pv32 was obtained from PlasmoDB. Recombinant
Pv32 protein was expressed and purified using a wheat germ cell-free expression
system and a glutathione-Sepharose column. Naturally acquired immune response to 
recombinant Pv32 protein was evaluated using a protein microarray with 96
parasite-infected patients and 96 healthy individuals. Antibodies against
recombinant Pv32 proteins from immune animals were produced, used and analyzed
for the subcellular localization of native Pv32 protein by an immunofluorescence 
assay. A total of 48 pv32 sequences from 11 countries retrieved from PlasmoDB
were used to determine the genetic diversity, polymorphisms and genealogical
relationships with DNAsp and NETWORK software packages.
RESULTS: Pv32 is encoded by a conserved gene with two introns that are located on
chromosome 13 and expressed as a 32 kDa protein in mature asexual stage
parasites. Immunofluorescence data showed that Pv32 localized on the merozoite
surface in schizont-stage parasites. The recombinant Pv32 was recognized by 39.6%
of antibodies from P. vivax-infected individuals compared with healthy
individuals. Low levels of nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0028) and polymorphisms of
pv32 were detected within worldwide isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the identification and characterization of the
hypothetical protein, Pv32. Pv32 provides important characteristics, including a 
merozoite surface protein, a predicted GPI motif and Cysteine-rich motif among
Plasmodium species. These results suggested that Pv32 is immunogenic with a
merozoite surface pattern to antibodies during natural infection in humans.
