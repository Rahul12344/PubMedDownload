Despite their importance in sexual differentiation and reproduction, Y chromosome
genes are rarely described because they reside in repeat-rich regions that are
difficult to study. Here, we show that Guy1, a unique Y chromosome gene of a
major urban malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi, confers 100% female lethality
when placed on the autosomes. We show that the small GUY1 protein (56 amino acids
in length) causes female lethality and that males carrying the transgene are
reproductively more competitive than their non-transgenic siblings under
laboratory conditions. The GUY1 protein is a primary signal from the Y chromosome
that affects embryonic development in a sex-specific manner. Our results have
demonstrated, for the first time in mosquitoes, the feasibility of stable
transgenic manipulation of sex ratios using an endogenous gene from the
male-determining chromosome. These results provide insights into the elusive M
factor and suggest exciting opportunities to reduce mosquito populations and
disease transmission.
