The C3, C5, C6 type sugar phosphate transporters bring sugars inside apicoplast, 
thus providing energy, reducing power and elements like carbon to apicoplast.
Plasmodium berghei has two C3 type sugar phosphate transporters in the membrane
of apicoplast: triose phosphate transporter (TPT) and phosphoenolpyruvate
transporter (PPT). Here we report that P. berghei TPT knockout parasites failed
to survive. However, PPT knockout parasite behaved similar to the wild type in
the blood stages. The absence of PPT in other life stages, leads to defects in
the development of parasite and was required at both mosquito as well as liver
stages. This study also underlines the essentiality of triose transporters for
apicoplast and its downstream pathways.
