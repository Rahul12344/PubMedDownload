BACKGROUND: Coadministration of artemether-lumefantrine and efavirenz has been
shown to result in significant interactions. The influence of functional genetic 
polymorphisms in selected CYPs on the magnitude of this interaction was
investigated in pregnant and nonpregnant adults.
METHOD: A standard 3-day regimen of artemether-lumefantrine was administered to
each patient on steady-state efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from intensive plasma concentration-time
data. Genotyping data were tested for compliance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
by Chi-square test. Linear regressions, Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis
tests were conducted to examine the association of lumefantrine plasma level with
CYP2B6 c.516G>T, NR1I3 152c-1089T>C, CYP2B6 c.983T>C, CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A4*22.
RESULTS: Among a total of 69 malaria-HIV coinfected patients (34 nonpregnant and 
35 pregnant), median (interquartile range) age was 33 (27-36.5) years and body
weight was 59.5 (50-67.5) kg. In nonpregnant group, CYP2B6 c.516G>T was
significantly associated with lower log Cday 7 of lumefantrine using multivariate
linear regressions (β = -0.239; P = 0.013). In 59% of women with CYP2B6 c.516T,
Cday 7 of lumefantrine was below the target of 280 ng/mL compared to 47% in the
noncarriers. CYP2B6 c.983T>C significantly associated with higher log Cday 7 of
desbutyl lumefantrine in both pregnant (β = 0.383; P = 0.033) and nonpregnant
(β = 0.395; P = 0.023) groups. Composite genotypes for both CYP2B6
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with lumefantrine plasma
concentration. An associative trend between lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and
NR1I3 152c-1089T>C genotypes indicated that 70% of the Cday 7 of lumefantrine in 
those with NR1I3 152c-1089TT genotype was below 280 ng/mL compared to 53% in
those with NR1I3 152c-1089CC or CT genotype.
CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that the efavirenz-lumefantrine interaction was
accentuated in the group with CYP2B6 c.516T, c.983C and NR1I3 152c-1089T alleles.
This warrants further investigations of other drug-drug interactions for
optimising dosing in genetically defined subgroups, particularly during drug
development.
