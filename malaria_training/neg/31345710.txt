BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
malaria to artemisinin combination therapies in the Greater Mekong subregion
poses a major threat to malaria control and elimination. The current study is
part of a multi-country, open-label, randomised clinical trial (TRACII, 2015-18) 
evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of triple artemisinin
combination therapies. A very high rate of treatment failure after treatment with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was observed in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
The immediate public health importance of our findings prompted us to report the 
efficacy data on dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and its determinants ahead of the
results of the overall trial, which will be published later this year.
METHODS: Patients aged between 2 and 65 years presenting with uncomplicated P
falciparum or mixed species malaria at seven sites in Thailand, Cambodia, and
Vietnam were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with or 
without mefloquine, as part of the TRACII trial. The primary outcome was the
PCR-corrected efficacy at day 42. Next-generation sequencing was used to assess
the prevalence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance
(kelch13 mutations, in particular Cys580Tyr) and piperaquine resistance
(plasmepsin-2 and plasmepsin-3 amplifications and crt mutations). This study is
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453308.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 28, 2015, and Jan 18, 2018, 539 patients with acute P
falciparum malaria were screened for eligibility, 292 were enrolled, and 140
received dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimate of
PCR-corrected efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at day 42 was 50·0% (95%
CI 41·1-58·3). PCR-corrected efficacies for individual sites were 12·7%
(2·2-33·0) in northeastern Thailand, 38·2% (15·9-60·5) in western Cambodia, 73·4%
(57·0-84·3) in Ratanakiri (northeastern Cambodia), and 47·1% (33·5-59·6) in Binh 
Phuoc (southwestern Vietnam). Treatment failure was associated independently with
plasmepsin2/3 amplification status and four mutations in the crt gene (Thr93Ser, 
His97Tyr, Phe145Ile, and Ile218Phe). Compared with the results of our previous
TRACI trial in 2011-13, the prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin
resistance (kelch13 Cys580Tyr mutations) and piperaquine resistance
(plasmepsin2/3 amplifications and crt mutations) has increased substantially in
the Greater Mekong subregion in the past decade.
INTERPRETATION: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is not treating malaria
effectively across the eastern Greater Mekong subregion. A highly drug-resistant 
P falciparum co-lineage is evolving, acquiring new resistance mechanisms, and
spreading. Accelerated elimination of P falciparum malaria in this region is
needed urgently, to prevent further spread and avoid a potential global health
emergency.
