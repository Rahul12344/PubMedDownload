With the exception of primaquine, tafenoquine, and atovaquone, there are very few
antimalarials that target liver stage parasites. In this study, a transgenic
Plasmodium berghei parasite (1052Cl1; PbGFP-Luc(con)) that expresses luciferase
was used to assess the anti-liver stage parasite activity of ICI 56,780, a
7-(2-phenoxyethoxy)-4(1H)-quinolone (PEQ), as well as two
3-phenyl-4(1H)-quinolones (P4Q), P4Q-146 and P4Q-158, by using bioluminescent
imaging (BLI). Results showed that all of the compounds were active against liver
stage parasites; however, ICI 56,780 and P4Q-158 were the most active, with low
nanomolar activity in vitro and causal prophylactic activity in vivo. This potent
activity makes these compounds ideal candidates for advancement as novel
antimalarials.
