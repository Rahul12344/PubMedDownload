Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP) has not been evaluated in the Republic of Congo since its
implementation in 2006 and there is no published data on molecular markers of SP 
resistance among Plasmodium falciparum isolates from pregnant women. This first
study in this country aimed to describe the prevalence of dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) point mutations and haplotypes in P.
falciparum isolates collected from pregnant women with asymptomatic infection.
From March 2012 to December 2013, pregnant women attending Madibou health centre 
(in Southern Brazzaville) for antenatal visits were enrolled in this study after 
obtaining their written informed consent. Blood samples were collected and P.
falciparum infections were characterized using PCR. A total of 363 pregnant women
were enrolled. P. falciparum infection was detected in 67 (18.4%) samples as
their PCR amplification of dhfr and dhps genes yielded bands and all the PCR
products were successfully digested. Out of these 67 isolates, 59 (88%), 57 (85%)
and 53 (79.1%) carried 51I, 59R and 108N dhfr mutant alleles, respectively. The
prevalence of dhps 436A, 437G and 540E mutations were 67.1% (45/67), 98.5%
(66/67) and 55.2% (37/67), respectively. More than one-half of the isolates
carried quintuple mutations, with highly resistant haplotype dhfr51I/59R/108N +
dhps437G/540E detected in 33% (22/67) whereas 25% (17/67) were found to carry
sextuple mutations. We observed significantly higher frequencies of triple dhps
mutations 436A/437G/540E and quintuple mutations dhfr51I/59R/108N+dhps437G/540E
in isolates from women who received IPTp-SP than those who did not. Overall, this
study shows high prevalence rates of SP-associated resistance mutations in P.
falciparum isolates collected from pregnant women. The presence of the dhps
mutant allele 540E and the high prevalence of isolates carrying quintuple
dhfr/dhps mutations are here reported for the first time in the Republic of
Congo. The increasing prevalence of multiple mutant alleles observed in this
study is alarming and may present a challenge for the future interventions
including IPTp-SP in the country.
