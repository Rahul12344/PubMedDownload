Malaria is a parasitic disease which threatens human life and health seriously.
Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been recommended for intermittent preventive
treatment of malaria in children and pregnant women, and also used as a compound 
component of artemisinin based therapy. The mechanisms of SP resistance in P.
falciparum involve point mutations in the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase 
(DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), and the drug pressure can also lead
to the mutations in the two genes of P. vivax. To provide the information for the
formulation of anti-malarial strategies, this article reviews the discovery,
application, effect of SP, and the resistance mechanism and research progress of 
the related genes in P. vivax.

Publisher: [摘要] 疟疾是一种严重威胁人类生命健康的寄生虫病。磺胺多辛-乙胺嘧啶可用于儿童和孕妇疟疾间歇性预防性治 疗,
同时其也作为以青蒿素及其衍生物为基础的联合疗法的一种复方成分而被用于疟疾治疗。恶性疟原虫对磺胺多辛-乙胺嘧啶产生抗药性与编码二氢叶酸还原酶 (DHPS)
和二氢蝶酸合酶 (DHFR) 的基因发生点突变相关, 而药物选择压力
亦可导致间日疟原虫上述两个基因发生突变。本文就抗疟药磺胺多辛-乙胺嘧啶的发现、应用、作用和间日疟原虫对其 抗性机制及抗性相关基因研究进展作一综述,
旨在为抗疟策略的制定提供参考依据。.
