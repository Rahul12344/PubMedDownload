OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic diversity at the msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes of
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolates from 3 endemic areas in Thailand: 
Tak, Kanchanaburi and Ranong provinces.
METHODS: A total of 144 P. falciparum isolates collected prior to treatment
during January, 2012 to June, 2013 were genotyped. DNA was extracted; allele
frequency and diversity of msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes were investigated by
nested polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: P. falciparum isolates in this study had high rate of multiple genotypes
infection (96.5%) with an overall mean multiplicity of infection of 3.21. The
distribution of allelic families of msp-1 was significantly different among
isolates from Tak, Kanchanaburi, and Ranong but not for the msp-2. K1 and MAD20
were the predominant allelic families at the msp-1 gene, whereas alleles
belonging to 3D7 were more frequent at the msp-2 gene. The glurp gene had the
least diverse alleles. Population structure of P. falciparum isolates from Tak
and Ranong was quite similar as revealed by the presence of similar proportions
of MAD20 and K1 alleles at msp-1 loci, 3D7 and FC27 alleles at msp-2 loci as well
as comparable mean MOI. Isolates from Kanchanaburi had different structures; the 
most prevalent alleles were K1 and RO33.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that P. falciparum isolates from Tak and
Ranong provinces had similar allelic pattern of msp-1 and msp-2 and diversity but
different from Kanchanaburi isolates. These allelic variant profiles are valuable
baseline data for future epidemiological study of malaria transmission and for
continued monitoring of polymorphisms associated with antimalarial drug
resistance in these areas.
