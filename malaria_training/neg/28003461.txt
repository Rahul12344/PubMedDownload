Resistance to pyrethroids, the sole insecticide class recommended for treating
bed nets, threatens the control of major malaria vectors, including Anopheles
funestus Effective management of resistance requires an understanding of the
dynamics and mechanisms driving resistance. Here, using genome-wide transcription
and genetic diversity analyses, we show that a shift in the molecular basis of
pyrethroid resistance in southern African populations of this species is
associated with a restricted gene flow. Across the most highly endemic and
densely populated regions in Malawi, An. funestus is resistant to pyrethroids,
carbamates, and organochlorides. Genome-wide microarray-based transcription
analysis identified overexpression of cytochrome P450 genes as the main mechanism
driving this resistance. The most up-regulated genes include cytochrome P450s
(CYP) CYP6P9a, CYP6P9b and CYP6M7. However, a significant shift in the
overexpression profile of these genes was detected across a south/north transect,
with CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b more highly overexpressed in the southern resistance
front and CYP6M7 predominant in the northern front. A genome-wide genetic
structure analysis of southern African populations of An. funestus from Zambia,
Malawi, and Mozambique revealed a restriction of gene flow between populations,
in line with the geographical variation observed in the transcriptomic analysis. 
Genetic polymorphism analysis of the three key resistance genes, CYP6P9a,
CYP6P9b, and CYP6M7, support barriers to gene flow that are shaping the
underlying molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance across southern Africa. This 
barrier to gene flow is likely to impact the design and implementation of
resistance management strategies in the region.
