Transmission of Plasmodium vivax still persist in Malaysia despite the
government's aim to eliminate malaria in 2020. High treatment failure rate of
chloroquine monotherapy was reported recently. Hence, parasite drug
susceptibility should be kept under close monitoring. Mutation analysis of the
drug resistance markers is useful for reconnaissance of anti-malarial drug
resistance. Hitherto, information on P. vivax drug resistance marker in Malaysia 
are limited. This study aims to evaluate the mutations in four P. vivax drug
resistance markers pvcrt-o (putative), pvmdr1 (putative), pvdhfr and pvdhps in 44
isolates from Malaysia. Finding indicates that 27.3%, 100%, 47.7%, and 27.3% of
the isolates were carrying mutant allele in pvcrt-o, pvmdr1, pvdhfr and pvdhps
genes, respectively. Most of the mutant isolates had multiple point mutations
rather than single point mutation in pvmdr1 (41/44) and pvdhfr (19/21). One novel
point mutation V111I was detected in pvdhfr. Allelic combination analysis shows
significant strong association between mutations in pvcrt-o and pvmdr1
(X2 = 9.521, P < 0.05). In the present study, 65.9% of the patients are
non-Malaysians, with few of them arrived in Malaysia 1-2 weeks before the onset
of clinical manifestations, or had previous history of malaria infection.
Besides, few Malaysian patients had travel history to vivax-endemic countries,
suggesting that these patients might have acquired the infections during their
travel. All these possible imported cases could have placed Malaysia in a risk to
have local transmission or outbreak of malaria. Six isolates were found to have
mutations in all four drug resistance markers, suggesting that the multiple-drugs
resistant P. vivax strains are circulating in Malaysia.
