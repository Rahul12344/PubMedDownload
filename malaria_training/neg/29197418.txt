BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite. Currently,
there are seldom commercial antibodies against P. falciparum proteins, which
greatly limits the study on Plasmodium. CRISPR/Cas9 is an efficient genome
editing method, which has been employed in various organisms. However, the use of
this technique in P. falciparum is still limited to gene knockout, site-specific 
mutation and generation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter line with
disruption of inserted sites.
RESULTS: We have adapted the CRISPR/Cas9 system to add commercial tag sequences
to endogenous genes of P. falciparum. To add HA or HA-TY1 tags to ck2β1, ck2α and
stk, pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2β1/ck2α/stk was constructed, which contained sequences of
tags, specific homologous arms, and sgRNA. The P. falciparum 3D7 strain was
subsequently transfected with pUF1-BSD-Cas9 and pL6cs-hDHFR-ck2β1/ck2α/stk
plasmids via electroporation. After that, BSD and WR99210 drugs were added to the
culture to screen parasites containing both plasmids. Twenty days after
electroporation, live parasites appeared and were collected to check the tagging 
by PCR, DNA sequencing, Western blotting and immuno-fluorescence assays. The
results showed that the tags were successfully integrated into the C-terminus of 
these three proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: We have improved the method to integrate tags to Plasmodium
falciparum genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which lays the foundation for
further study of Plasmodium falciparum at the molecular level.
