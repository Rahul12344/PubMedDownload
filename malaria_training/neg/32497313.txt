Gene drive is the process of copying of an endonuclease-containing cassette that 
leads to increased frequency of inheritance of the desired traits in a targeted
population. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is advancing genetic manipulation of insects
in the field of gene drive experiments. The CRISPR/Cas9 drive could be engineered
for genetic manipulation of parasites and/or vectors for disease control. A
number of promising CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive strategies that interfere with
parasite development or impairs the reproductive capability of the insect vector 
have been proposed in the laboratory for blocking transmission of malaria and
leishmaniasis. Still several technical and ethical challenges remain to be
addressed, and none appear insuperable in this field.
