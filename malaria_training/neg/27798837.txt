Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) is one of the few
chemical-genetically validated drug targets for malaria, yet highly selective
inhibitors have not been described. In this paper, approximately 40,000 compounds
were screened to identify compounds that selectively inhibit PfProRS enzyme
activity versus Homo sapiens (Hs) ProRS. X-ray crystallography structures were
solved for apo, as well as substrate- and inhibitor-bound forms of PfProRS. We
identified two new inhibitors of PfProRS that bind outside the active site. These
two allosteric inhibitors showed >100 times specificity for PfProRS compared to
HsProRS, demonstrating this class of compounds could overcome the toxicity
related to HsProRS inhibition by halofuginone and its analogues. Initial
medicinal chemistry was performed on one of the two compounds, guided by the
cocrystallography of the compound with PfProRS, and the results can instruct
future medicinal chemistry work to optimize these promising new leads for drug
development against malaria.
