Malaria represents a major global health issue, and the identification of new
intervention targets remains an urgent priority. This search is hampered by more 
than one-third of the genes of malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites being
uncharacterized. We report a large-scale protein interaction network in
Plasmodium schizonts, generated by combining blue native-polyacrylamide
electrophoresis with quantitative mass spectrometry and machine learning. This
integrative approach, spanning 3 species, identifies >20,000 putative protein
interactions, organized into 600 protein clusters. We validate selected
interactions, assigning functions in chromatin regulation to previously
unannotated proteins and suggesting a role for an EELM2 domain-containing protein
and a putative microrchidia protein as mechanistic links between AP2-domain
transcription factors and epigenetic regulation. Our interactome represents a
high-confidence map of the native organization of core cellular processes in
Plasmodium parasites. The network reveals putative functions for uncharacterized 
proteins, provides mechanistic and structural insight, and uncovers potential
alternative therapeutic targets.
