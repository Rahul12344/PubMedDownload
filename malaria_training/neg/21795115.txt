Although clinically benign, malaria fever is thought to have significant
relevance in terms of parasite growth and survival and its virulence which in
turn may alter the clinical course of illness. In this article, the historical
literature is reviewed, providing some evolutionary perspective on the genesis
and biological relevance of malaria fever, and the available molecular data on
the febrile-temperature-inducible parasite factors that may contribute towards
the regulation of parasite density and alteration of virulence in the host is
also discussed. The potential molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for 
the induction and regulation of cyclical malaria fevers caused by different
species of Plasmodium are also discussed.
