BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
(DHA/PPQ) are the recommended first- and second-line treatments, respectively,
for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Somalia. The studies reported here were
conducted to assess the efficacy of these artemisinin-based combinations and the 
mutations in Plasmodium falciparum K13-propeller (Pfk13) domain and amplification
in Pfplasmepsin 2 (Pfpm2) gene in Somalia.
METHODS: One-arm prospective studies were conducted to assess the clinical and
parasitological responses to DHA/PPQ and AL at two sites in 2016 and 2017,
respectively, using the standard WHO protocol. The patterns of molecular markers 
associated with artemisinin and PPQ resistance were investigated for the first
time in Somalia.
RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were enrolled with 139 for AL and 200 for
DHA/PPQ. With AL, no parasite recurrence was observed among patients treated at
either site, corresponding to 100% clinical and parasitological responses. For
DHA-PPQ, an adequate clinical and parasitological response rate > 97% was
observed. All study patients on both treatments at both sites were parasite-free 
on day 3. Of the 138 samples with interpretable results for the polymorphism in
Pfk13, only one (0.7%), from Bosaso, contained a non-synonymous mutation (R622I),
which is not one of the known markers of artemisinin resistance. No Pfpm2
amplification was observed among the 135 samples with interpretable results.
CONCLUSIONS: AL and DHA/PPQ were highly effective in the treatment of
uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and there was no evidence of resistance to
artemisinin or PPQ. These two combinations are thus relevant in the
chemotherapeutic strategy for malaria control in Somalia. Trial registration
