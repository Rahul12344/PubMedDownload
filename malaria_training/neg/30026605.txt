RUVBLs constitute a conserved group of ATPase proteins that play significant role
in a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell
cycle and DNA damage repair. Three RUVBL homologues, namely, PfRUVBL1, PfRUVBL2
and PfRUVBL3 have been identified in P. falciparum, unlike its eukaryotic
counterparts, which have two RUVBL proteins (RUVBL1 & RUVBL2). The present study 
expands our understanding of PfRUVBL3 protein and thereby basic biology of
Plasmodium in general. Here, we have shown that parasite PfRUVBL3 is a true
homolog of human/yeast RUVBL2 protein. Our result show that PfRUVBL3
constitutively expresses throughout the stages of intra-erythrocytic cycle (IDC) 
with varied localization. In addition to ATPase and oligomerization activity, we 
have for the first time shown that PfRUVBL3 possess DNA cleavage activity which
interestingly is dependent on its insertion domain. Furthermore, we have also
identified RUVBL3 to be an interacting partner of an essential chromatin
remodeling protein PfMYST and together they colocalize with H3K9me1 histone in
parasitophorous vacuole during the ring stage of IDC suggesting their potential
involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription.
