cerebral expression c-fos protein studied immunocytochemistry murine
cerebral malaria (cm) malaria without cerebral involvement (non-cm). c-fos
expression, low brains uninfected mice, increased frequency,
intensity, distribution course fatal cm (e.g., 70-fold
increase day 7 inoculation). changes paralleled timing and
degree neurologic complications histopathologic changes. slight
increase c-fos expression detectable non-cm mice day 7 after
inoculation. dexamethasone treatment (days 0 1 inoculation) cm
mice largely prevented increased cerebral c-fos expression, histopathologic
changes, cerebral complications, death. increased c-fos expression may
indicate specific neuronal pathways activated immunopathologic process
of fatal murine cm could associated behavioral changes and
neurologic complications model.
