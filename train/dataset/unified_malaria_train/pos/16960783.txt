the anion-exchange protein 1 (ae1 band 3) involved erythrocyte
invasion malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, adhesion infected 
erythrocytes endothelial cells, regulation acid-base homeostasis,
which critical factor human survival severe malaria. variant the
ae1 gene promoter 512 base pairs (bp) distant transcription start site
and 5699 bp translation start codon (ae1(-5699t-->c)) shown 
be highly frequent population ashanti region, ghana. a
matched-pair case-control study (736 pairs), children heterozygous the
mutation (ae1(-5699ct)) increased risk severe malarial anemia (odds
ratio [or], 1.45 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.05-2.01]; p<.03). children
who developed complication, carriers mutation ae1(-5699c) a
higher fatality rate genotype ae1(-5699tt) (relative risk,
7.1 [95% ci, 1.0-52.8]). moreover, children cerebral malaria, ae1(-5699c)
was positively associated distinctive metabolic acidosis (p<.002), and
results luciferase assays showed higher transcriptional activity the
ae1(-5699c) allele. results demonstrate ae1 promoter allele might 
influence infection phenotype risk fatal outcome children 
severe malaria. regard, crucial role ae1 protein malaria is
emphasized.
