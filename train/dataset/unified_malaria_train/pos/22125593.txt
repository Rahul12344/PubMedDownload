background: spite significant mortality associated plasmodium
falciparum infection, mechanisms underlying severe disease remain poorly
understood. previously shown evidence endothelial activation in
ghanaian children malaria, indicated elevated plasma levels von
willebrand factor (vwf) propeptide. current prospective study of
children malawi retinopathy confirmed cerebral malaria, compared these
markers uncomplicated malaria, non malarial febrile illness controls.
methods findings: children cerebral malaria, mild malaria controls
without malaria recruited study. comatose patients were
examined direct indirect ophthalmoscopy. plasma vwf propeptide levels 
were measured elisa. median vwf propeptide levels significantly
higher patients uncomplicated malaria children non-malarial 
febrile illness comparable severity, levels higher in
non-febrile controls. median concentrations markers higher in
cerebral malaria uncomplicated malaria, similar patients with
and without retinopathy. levels vwf propeptide fell significantly 48 
hours commencing therapy normal one month later.
conclusions: children malaria plasma vwf propeptide levels are
markedly elevated cerebral mild paediatric malaria, levels
matching disease severity, normalize upon recovery. high levels both
markers also occur retinopathy-negative 'cerebral malaria' cases, many whom
are thought suffering diseases malaria, indicating that
further studies markers required determine sensitivity 
and specificity.
