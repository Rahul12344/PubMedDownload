type interferon (ifn) critical controlling pathogen infection; however, 
its regulatory mechanisms plasmacytoid cells (pdcs) still remain unclear.
here, shown nucleic acid sensors cgas-, sting-, mda5-, mavs-, or
transcription factor irf3-deficient mice produced high amounts type ifn-α
and ifn-β (ifn-α/β) serum resistant lethal plasmodium yoelii
ym infection. robust ifn-α/β production abolished gene encoding nucleic 
acid sensor tlr7, signaling adaptor myd88, transcription factor irf7 was
ablated pdcs depleted. further, identified socs1 key negative
regulator to inhibit myd88-dependent type ifn signaling pdcs. finally, we
have demonstrated pdcs, cdcs, macrophages required generating
ifn-α/β-induced subsequent protective immunity. thus, findings have
identified critical regulatory mechanism type ifn signaling pdcs and
stage-specific function immune cells generating potent immunity against
lethal ym infection.
