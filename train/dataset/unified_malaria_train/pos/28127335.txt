background: aimed reveal role cd11b hypoxia-inducible
factors-1alpha (hif-1α) expressions monocytes alveolar macrophages lung
tissue, levels serum surfactant protein-d (sp-d) severe
malaria-associated acute lung injury (ali).
methods: c57bl/6 mice divided control group, renal malaria group
(inoculated 106plasmodium berghei anka), cerebral malaria group
(inoculated 107p. berghei anka). expressions cd11b hif-1α lung
tissue observed immunohistochemistry, serum sp-d levels measured
by elisa. study conducted june 2014 february 2015 the
laboratory parasitology, faculty medicine, universitas brawijaya, malang.
results: cd11b expression pulmonary tissue renal cerebral malaria
mice significantly higher control mice (p=0.002; p=0.002), well as
the hif-1α expression pulmonary tissue (p=0.002; p=0.002). level serum 
sp-d renal malaria cerebral malaria mice significantly higher than
control mice (p=0.002; p=0.002). found strong correlation the
expression cd11b hif-1α lung tissue (r=0.937, p=0.000), well as
between cd11b expression serum sp-d levels (r=0.907, p=0.000) between
hif-1α expression serum sp-d levels (r=0.913, p=0.000).
conclusion: severe malaria-associated ali increased expression cd11b and
hif-1α lung tissue increased serum sp-d levels c57bl/6 mice
significantly.
