survival host. il-10, key regulatory cytokine produced many cells 
the immune system, shown protect mice pathology acute 
plasmodium0 chabaudi chabaudi model malaria. however, critical cellular
source il-10 still unknown. article, demonstrate t
cell-derived il-10 necessary control pathology acute
malaria, mice bearing specific deletion il10 cells fully reproduce the
phenotype observed il10(-)(/)(-) mice, significant weight loss, decline
in temperature, increased mortality. furthermore, show ifn-γ(+) th1
cells main producers il-10 throughout acute infection, expressing high
levels cd44 icos, low levels cd127. although foxp3(+) regulatory
cd4(+) cells produce il-10 infection, highly activated ifn-γ(+) th1
cells shown essential sufficient source il-10 guarantee 
protection severe immune-mediated pathology. finally, model of
malaria, demonstrate generation protective il10(+)ifn-γ(+) th1
cells dependent il-27 signaling independent il-21.
