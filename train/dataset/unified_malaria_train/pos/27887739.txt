proinflammatory responses associated severity cerebral malaria.
no, h2o2, eicosanoid ppar-γ involved proinflammatory responses, but
regulation factors unclear malaria. work aimed compare the
expression eicosanoid-forming-enzymes cerebral malaria-susceptible cba 
c57bl/6 -resistant balb/c mice. mice infected plasmodium berghei
anka, survival rates parasitemia curves assessed. sixth
day post-infection, cyclooxygenase-2 5-lipoxygenase brain sections were
assessed immunohistochemistry, and, no, h2o2, lipid bodies, ppar-γ
expression assessed peritoneal macrophages. c57bl/6 severe
disease lower survival time, higher parasitemia lower production of
plasmodicidal h2o2 molecules balb/c. enhanced cox-2 5-lox
expression observed brain tissue cells vessels c57bl/6 mice, and
these mice expressed higher constitutive ppar-γ levels. no
translocation ppar-γ cytoplasm nucleus macrophages mice.
cba mice enhanced cox-2 expression brain tissue cells vessels also
lacked ppar-γ cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation. resistant balb/c mice
presented higher survival time, lower parasitemia higher h2o2
production sixth day post-infection. mice express either
cox-2 5-lox brain tissue cells vessels. data showed besides
the high parasite burden lack microbicidal molecules, imbalance with
high cox-2 5-lox eicosanoid expression lack regulatory ppar-γ
cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation macrophages observed mice that
develop cerebral malaria.
