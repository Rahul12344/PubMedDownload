cerebral malaria (cm) associated high rate transient persistent
neurological sequelae. nogo-a, protein highly expressed the
endoplasmic reticulum (er) mammalian central nervous system (cns), is
involved neuronal regeneration synaptic plasticity injured cns. the
current study investigates role nogo-a course experimental cm.
c57bl/6j mice infected plasmodium berghei anka blood stages. brain
homogenates mice different clinical severity levels cm, infected
animals without cm control animals analyzed nogo-a up-regulation 
western blotting immunohistochemistry. brain regions nogo-a upregulation
were evaluated transmission electron microscopy. densitometric analysis of
western blots yielded statistically significant upregulation nogo-a mice 
showing moderate severe cm. number neurons oligodendrocytes
positive nogo-a differ significantly studied groups.
however, mice severe cm showed significantly higher number cells with
intense nogo-a staining brain stem. region ultrastructural
alterations er regularly observed. nogo-a upregulated the
early course experimental cm. brain stem severely affected animals
increased nogo-a expression ultrastructural changes er observed. 
these data indicate role nogo-a neuronal stress response during
experimental cm.
