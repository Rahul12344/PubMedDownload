background: babesiosis dogs associated severe thrombocytopenia; yet
infected dogs rarely show clinical signs hemorrhage.
hypothesis: dogs uncomplicated babesiosis normal hemostatic capacity
despite severe thrombocytopenia.
animals: nineteen client-owned dogs uncomplicated babesiosis; 10 healthy
controls.
methods: prospective, cross-sectional, observational study. thromboelastography
(teg), prothrombin time (pt), activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt),
fibrinogen, d-dimers, antithrombin (at) measured groups. statistical 
significance set p < .01.
results: babesiosis group hematocrit platelet count significantly lower 
controls (0.29 versus 0.50 l/l; p < .001 20.0 versus 374.5 × 10(9)/l; p <
.001, respectively). except k, significant difference teg variables
between groups. hemostatic variables babesiosis group versus controls (mean ±
sd); r: 5.9 ± 1.8 versus 4.6 ± 0.9 min (p = .048); k: 2.8 ± 1.1 versus 1.9 ± 0.6 
min (p = .003); angle: 55.5 ± 11.7 versus 62.2 ± 4.1 degrees (p = .036); ma: 48.4
± 9.7 versus 57.2 ± 5.2 mm (p = 0.013); g: 5.1 ± 1.9 versus 6.9 ± 1.5 dyn/cm(2)
(p = .019); ly30 (median, range): 0 (0-5.7) versus 0.6% (0-6.1) (p = .152); and
ly60: 0 (0-8.8) versus 3.1% (0-13.1) (p = .012). activity significantly lower 
(105.2 ± 16.5 versus 127.8 ± 15.4%; p = .001). fibrinogen concentration
significantly higher babesiosis group (5.7 ± 1.3 versus. 3.0 ± 0.7 g/l; p <
.001).
conclusion clinical importance: despite severe thrombocytopenia, dogs with
uncomplicated babesiosis clinical signs hemorrhage teg
variables normal, could indicate normocoagulable state.
