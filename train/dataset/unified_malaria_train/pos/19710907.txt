an in-depth knowledge host molecules biological pathways that
contribute towards pathogenesis cerebral malaria would help guide the
development novel prognostics therapeutics. genome-wide transcriptional
profiling brain tissue experimental cerebral malaria (ecm ) caused 
by plasmodium berghei anka parasites mice, well established surrogate of
human cerebral malaria, useful predicting functional classes of
genes involved pathways altered course disease. further
understand contribution individual genes pathogenesis ecm, we
examined biological relevance three molecules -- cd14, galectin-3, and
ox40 previously shown overexpressed ecm. find cd14
plays predominant role induction ecm regulation parasite
density; deletion cd14 gene prevented onset disease a
majority susceptible mice (only 21% cd14-deficient compared 80% of
wildtype mice developed ecm, p<0.0004) also ameliorating effect on
parasitemia (a 2 fold reduction cerebral phase). furthermore, deletion
of galectin-3 gene susceptible c57bl/6 mice resulted partial protection
from ecm (47% galectin-3-deficient versus 93% wildtype mice developed ecm, 
p<0.0073). subsequent adherence assays suggest galectin-3 induced
pathogenesis ecm mediated recognition binding galectin-3 
to p. berghei anka parasites. previous study ecm demonstrated brain
infiltrating cells strongly activated cd44(+)cd62l(-)
differentiated memory cells [1]. find ox40, marker cell
activation memory, selectively upregulated brain ecm its
distribution among cd4(+) cd8(+) cells accumulated brain vasculature
is approximately equal.
