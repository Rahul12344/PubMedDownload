background: amount gene expression data public repositories, such
as ncbi gene expression omnibus (geo) grown exponentially, provides a
gold mine bioinformaticians, easily accessible biologists
and clinicians.
results: developed automated approach annotate analyze geo data 
sets, including 1,515 geo data sets 231 microarray types across 42 species, 
and performed 12,658 group versus group comparisons 24 geo-specified types. we
then built genechaser, web server enables biologists clinicians
without bioinformatics skills easily identify biological clinical
conditions gene set genes differentially expressed.
genechaser displays conditions graphs, gives statistical comparisons,
allows sort/filter functions provides access original studies.we
performed single gene search nanog multiple gene search nanog,
oct4, sox2 lin28, confirmed roles embryonic stem cell development,
identified several drugs regulate expression, suggested their
potential roles sex determination, abnormal sperm morphology, malaria
infection, cancer.
conclusion: demonstrated genechaser powerful tool elucidate
information function, transcriptional regulation, drug-response clinical
implications genes interest.
