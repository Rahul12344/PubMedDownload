babesia gibsoni haemoprotozoan parasite emerging global importance. the
clinical presentation babesial infections diverse systemic
inflammatory response induced infection considered major feature of
the pathophysiology canine babesiosis. experimental case-controlled
longitudinal study conducted assess clinical, haematological, cytokine
and acute phase protein changes occur experimental b. gibsoni
infection beagle puppies. infected dogs became transiently pyrexic and
anaemic, intermittently neutropenic transiently, profoundly,
thrombocytopenic, although apparent adverse clinical effect.
experimental b. gibsoni infection also induced acute phase response,
characterised marked increase concentration c-reactive protein,
which delayed onset following infection preceded detection of
peripheral parasitaemia. experimental b. gibsoni infection also associated
with marked increases concentration multiple cytokines also 
delayed onset following infection occurred subsequent detection 
peripheral parasitaemia acute phase response. study furthers our
understanding immune response occurs babesial infections and
the role systemic inflammation plays pathophysiology canine
babesiosis.
