ovine babesiosis fatal disease characterized severe progressive hemolytic
anemia. order clarify causal mechanisms implicated anemia, this
study aimed assess antioxidant status erythrocyte oxidative stress
in sheep suffering ovine babesiosis. babesia infection confirmed both
with giemsa's staining blood smears semi-nested pcr amplified region 18s
rrna gene. thirty-eight iranian sheep, naturally infected babesia spp., were
considered infected group divided four subgroups according to
parasitemia rates (<1%, 1-2%, 2-3% >3%), number non-infected
animals selected control group. blood samples taken and
hematological parameters, activities antioxidant enzymes including erythrocyte
glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px), superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat),
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), total antioxidant capacity (tac),
median corpuscular fragility (mcf), serum concentrations trace
minerals (copper, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium) measured. in
addition, index lipid peroxidation, level malondialdehyde (mda)
was measured. results revealed significant decrease (p<0.01) rbc count, 
packed cell volume (pcv) hb concentration well activities of
erythrocyte gsh-px, sod, cat, g6pd, tac, mcf serum concentrations cu, zn, 
mn se infected sheep. contrast, significantly increased (p<0.01)
levels mda erythrocyte osmotic fragility well serum concentration of
iron recorded infected animals. overall, observed remarkable
decrease antioxidant enzyme activities, median corpuscular fragility and
substantial elevated levels lipid peroxidation associated notable
increase parasitemia indicate high exposure rbcs oxidative damage in
babesia infected sheep. results indicate disturbed antioxidant
defense mechanisms ovine babesiosis promote development anemia.
