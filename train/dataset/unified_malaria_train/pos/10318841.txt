plasmepsin ii, aspartic protease human intraerythrocytic parasite
plasmodium falciparum, involved degradation host cell hemoglobin
within acidic food vacuole parasite. previous characterization of
enzymatic activities plasmodium soluble extracts, responsible vitro
hydrolysis erythrocyte spectrin, shown hydrolysis process
occurred ph 5.0 involved aspartic protease(s) cleaving mainly within the
sh3 motif spectrin alpha-subunit. therefore, used recombinant
construct erythroid sh3 motif substrate investigate involvement 
of plasmepsins spectrin hydrolysis. using specific anti-plasmepsin ii
antibodies western blotting experiments, plasmepsin ii detected in
chromatographic fractions enriched parasite sh3 hydrolase activity.
involvement plasmepsin ii hydrolysis demonstrated mass spectrometry 
identification cleavage sites sh3 motif, upon hydrolysis plasmodium 
extract enzymatic activity, recombinant plasmepsin ii. furthermore,
recombinant plasmepsin ii digested native spectrin ph 6.8, either purified 
situated erythrocyte ghosts. additional degradation actin protein 4.1
from ghosts observed. specific antibodies used confocal imaging of
schizont-infected erythrocytes localize plasmepsin ii mature stages 
parasite development cycle; antibodies clearly labeled periphery the
parasites. taken together, results strongly suggest that, addition to
hemoglobin degradation, plasmepsin ii might involved cytoskeleton cleavage 
of infected erythrocytes.
