background: host innate immunity contributes malaria clinical outcome by
providing protective inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma, by
shaping adaptive immune response. plasmodium falciparum (pf) etiologic
agent severe forms human malaria. natural killer (nk) cells are
lymphocytes innate immune system first effectors produce
interferon-gamma response pf. however, molecular bases pf-nk cell
recognition events unknown. study focuses role pf erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), major pf virulence factor. pfemp1 expressed 
parasitized-erythrocytes participates vascular obstruction the
binding several host receptors. pfemp1 also pivotal target host
antibody response pf infection.
methodology/principal findings: using genetically-engineered parasite mutant
strains, human genetic deficiency, blocking antibodies, identified two
receptor-ligand pairs involved two uncoupled events occurring the
sensing pf infection nk cells. first, pfemp1 interaction one its
host receptor, chondroitin sulfate a, mediates cytoadhesion pf-infected
erythrocytes human nk cell lines, required primary nk cell
activation. second, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), another host
receptor pfemp1, mandatory nk cell interferon-gamma response. 
case, icam-1 acts via engagement host ligand, lfa-1, with
pfemp1, consistent obligatory cross-talk nk cells macrophages
for production interferon-gamma.
conclusion/significance: pfemp1-independent icam-1/lfa-1-dependent events
occurring nk cell activation pf highlight fundamental role of
cellular cooperation innate immune response malaria.
