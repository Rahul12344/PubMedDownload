il-10 shown profound immunoregulatory attributes the
bovine appears downregulate th1- th2-like responses. using rt-pcr, we
demonstrate il-10 vitro down-regulation mrna expression inos, the
cytokines involved nitric oxide signal transduction initiation (ifn-gamma 
tnf-alpha), mononuclear phagocyte associate cytokines. addition,
using rt-pcr peripheral blood leukocytes spleen leukocytes, griess
reaction, killing assay, provide evidence importance inos 
a successful immune response b. bovis infection high persistent
il-10 mrna expression immune response unsuccessful. also provide
evidence antibody developed early initial infection appears lack
protective attributes (neutralizing opsonic). together, data suggests
that il-10 ifn-gamma critical molecules involved response 
intraerythrocytic protozoan infection.
