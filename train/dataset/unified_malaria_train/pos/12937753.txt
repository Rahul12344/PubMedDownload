almost individuals (182) belonging amazonian riverine population
(portuchuelo, ro, brazil) investigated ascertaining data on
epidemiological aspects malaria. thirteen genetic blood polymorphisms were
investigated (abo, mnss, rh, kell, duffy systems, haptoglobins, hemoglobins, 
and enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase,
phosphoglucomutase, carbonic anhydrase, red cell acid phosphatase, esterase
d). results indicated duffy system associated susceptibility
to malaria, observed endemic areas. moreover, suggestions also arose 
indicating esd rh loci may significantly associated with
resistance malaria. statistical type ii errors sample stratification
could ruled out, hypotheses existence causal mechanism an
unknown closely linked locus involved susceptibility malaria infection may 
explain present findings.
