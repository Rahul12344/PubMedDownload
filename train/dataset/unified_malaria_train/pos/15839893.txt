we found phoshatidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3-k) markedly contributes the
increased surface expression bovine transferrin receptor (tfr) on
theileria-infected lymphocytes. observed aspects tfr turnover 
upregulated parasitized b cells able detect tfr colocalizing
with eea1 (early endosome antigen 1) rab11 ultrastructure level in
theileria-infected b cells. demonstrated recycling tfr rab5- and
rab11-positive compartments transfection dominant negative guanosine
diphosphate (gdp)-on mutants gtpases. therefore, theileria-transformed 
b cells constitutive pi3-k activity leads accelerated tfr recycling through
rab5- rab11-positive compartments.
