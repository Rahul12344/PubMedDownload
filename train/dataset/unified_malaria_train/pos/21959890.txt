to investigate effects babesia infection drug metabolism, we
intraperitoneally inoculated b. microti icr mice measured expression
and activity hepatic cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a, major drug-metabolizing
enzyme. twelve days infection, cyp3a11 mrna, cyp3a protein activity and
mrnas nuclear receptors, participate cyp3a expression, were
significantly reduced. results suggest b. microti infection suppresses
cyp3a-dependent drug metabolism. additionally, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α 
nitric oxide synthase (nos) 2 mrnas induced infected mouse liver.
since tnf-α one potent mediators induce nos2 repress cyp3a
transcription, possible involvement tnf-α downregulation cyp3a 
was discussed.
