cerebral malaria serious complication plasmodium falciparum infection. we
have investigated role perforin pathogenesis cerebral malaria in
a murine model (plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection). c57bl/6 mice
demonstrated typical neuropathological symptoms experimental cerebral
malaria infection day 5p.i. became moribund day 6p.i. pathology 
was seen pba-infected, perforin-deficient (pfp-/-) mice. days 5-6p.i.
onwards significant increase mrna granzyme b cd8, 
cd4, brain tissue pba-infected c57bl/6 pfp-/- mouse brains. perforin 
mrna strongly increased brains pba-infected c57bl/6 mice day
6p.i. immunohistochemistry revealed increased perforin staining elevated
numbers cd8(+) cells within cerebral microvessels pba-infected c57bl/6 
at days 5 6p.i. compared uninfected animals. day 6p.i., were
tunel-positive cells activated caspase-3 positive cells endothelial
morphology cns pba-infected c57bl/6 mice. tunel-positive cells were
greatly reduced pfp-/- mice. results suggest cd8(+)t lymphocytes
induce apoptosis endothelial cells via perforin-dependent process,
contributing fatal pathogenic process murine cerebral malaria.
