plasmodium falciparum malaria responsible nearly one million annual deaths
worldwide. difficulty monitoring pathogenesis cerebral
malaria humans, conducted study various mouse models better
understand disease progression experimental cerebral malaria (ecm). we
compared effect integrity blood brain barrier (bbb) the
histopathology brain p. berghei anka, known ecm model, p. berghei
nk65, generally thought induce ecm, p. yoelii 17xl, originally reported to
induce human cerebral malaria-like histopathology, p. yoelii ym. expected,
p. berghei anka infection caused neurological signs, cerebral hemorrhages, and
bbb dysfunction cba/caj swiss webster mice, balb/c a/j mice were
resistant. surprisingly, pbnk induced ecm cba/caj mice, mice
were resistant. p. yoelii 17xl p. yoelii ym caused lethal hyperparasitemia in
all mouse strains; histopathological alterations, bbb dysfunction, or
neurological signs observed. intravital imaging revealed infected
erythrocytes containing mature parasites passed slowly capillaries making
intimate contact endothelium, arrest. except relatively 
rare microhemorrhages, mice ecm presented obvious histopathological
alterations would explain widespread disruption bbb. intravital
imaging reveal, however, postcapillary venules, capillaries or
arterioles, mice ecm, hyperparasitemia, exhibit platelet
marginalization, extravascular fibrin deposition, cd14 expression, extensive 
vascular leakage. blockage lfa-1 mediated cellular interactions prevented
leukocyte adhesion, vascular leakage, neurological signs, death ecm. the
endothelial barrier-stabilizing mediators imatinib fty720 inhibited vascular 
leakage neurological signs prolonged survival ecm. thus, appears
that neurological signs coma ecm due regulated opening of
paracellular-junctional transcellular-vesicular fluid transport pathways at
the neuroimmunological bbb.
