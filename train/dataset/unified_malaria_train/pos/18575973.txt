the purpose study determine serum ada activity cattle naturally
infected theileria annulata. study, total 37 cross-bred cattle 
which 27 showing clinical signs theileriosis constituted infected group 
and 10 healthy cattle control group used animal materials. infected
group divided three groups according pcv values. cattle pcv > 
or = 25 put group (n = 9), pcv 13-24 put group ii (n
= 11) pcv < = 12 put group iii (n = 7). microscopical
diagnosis disease also made. hematological parameters, serum enzyme
activities (ada, ast, alt alp) determined cattle. hematological
results revealed significant progressive decreases hgb, plt, pbml counts 
and ratios group onwards group iii, whereas wbc, pbpl counts and
ratios showed increase group onwards group iii. serum ada, ast, 
alt alp activity increased significantly infected groups compared to
control group. however, parameters also observed decrease
progressively group group iii. furthermore, highest increase in
enzyme activities observed infected group i. but, enzyme's
activities started decrease infected group ii iii parallel pbml
and plt counts. eventhough, decrease reach values obtained
from control group. contrary, pbpl counts ratios increased infected
group ii iii contrast decrease pcv. result, increased serum ada
activity tropical theileriosis may reflect involvement cellular
immune responses.
