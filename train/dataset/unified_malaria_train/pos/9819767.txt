the present study designed investigate role cytokines the
pathogenesis babesia caballi experimentally infected horses. expression
of cytokine mrna determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction two b. caballi-infected horses 2 weeks infection. in
one horse, up-regulation interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) interleukin-2 mrnas, second horse,
expression tnf-alpha mrna up-regulated. change observed in
interleukin-4 mrna horses. know relation nitric
oxide (no) production pathogenesis, production assayed three
dexamethasone treated-b. caballi-infected horses. production 3
horses increased significantly death, although parasitemia level
remained low. treatment inhibitor resulted suppression 
production increased parasitemia level horse, died the
infection. pathological examination showed main cause death
was dyspnoea pulmonary edema. histopathologically, diffuse global mesangial
proliferative glomerulonephritis also observed. results suggested 
no may critical effector molecule immune defense parasite.
tnf-alpha might contributing pathogenesis b. caballi
infection.
