purpose: unclear children falciparum malaria develop acute
seizures determines phenotype seizures. sought determine if
polymorphisms malaria candidate genes associated acute seizures.
methods: logistic regression used investigate genetic associations with
malaria-associated seizures (mas) complex mas (repetitive, prolonged, or
focal seizures) four malariagen african sites, namely: blantyre, malawi;
kilifi, kenya; kumasi, ghana; muheza, tanzania. analysis repeated for
five inheritance models (dominant, heterozygous, recessive, additive, and
general) adjusted potential confounders multiple testing.
key findings: complex phenotypes seizures constituted 71% admissions
with mas across sites. mas strongly associated cluster of
differentiation-ligand-rs3092945 females kilifi (p = 0.00068) and
interleukin (il)-17 receptor e-rs708567 pooled analysis across sites
(p = 0.00709). complex mas strongly associated epidermal growth factor 
module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor (emr)1-rs373533 kumasi (p =
0.00033), none pooled analysis. focal mas strongly associated
with il-20 receptor a-rs1555498 muheza (p = 0.00016), none pooled
analysis. prolonged mas strongly associated complement receptor
1-rs17047660 kilifi (p = 0.00121) glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase-rs1050828 females pooled analysis (p = 0.00155).
repetitive mas strongly associated emr1-rs373533 kumasi (p =
0.00003) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor-rs17140229 the
pooled analysis (p = 0.00543). mas coma/cerebral malaria strongly
associated emr1-rs373533 kumasi (p = 0.00019) il10-rs3024500 the
pooled analysis across sites (p = 0.00064).
significance: identified number genetic associations may
explain risk seizures >2,000 cases admitted hospitals mas
across four sites africa. associations differed according phenotype
of seizures site.
