we studied impact complement component 3 (c3) deficiency the
progression lethal babesia rodhaini infection immune mice. b. gibsoni
ribosomal phosphoprotein p0 (bgp0) previously reported cross-protective
antigen babesia infection used immunize c57bl/6 wild-type (wt) and
c3-deficient (c3-/-) mice. test mice immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with
recombinant bgp0 (rbgp0), controls either immunized pbs did
not receive immunization. following immunization regime, test wt mice
induced specifically strong humoral response consisting mixed
immunoglobulins igg1 igg2 associated high production ifn-gamma the
supernatant splenocytes. test c3-/- mice significantly decreased
total igg, igg1 igg2b responses, secretions il-12 ifn-gamma tended
to lower wt mice. furthermore, partial protection only
observed rbgp0-immunized wt mice c3-/- mice controls. indeed,
rbgp0-immunized wt mice showed significant reductions initiation of
parasitaemia correlated delayed mortalities considerable survival rates.
taken together, results indicate cross-protection impaired c3-/- 
mice view decrease antibody responses cytokine production
and high susceptibility infection.
