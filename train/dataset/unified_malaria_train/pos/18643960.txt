cd4(+) cells respond antigen immunization process activation,
clonal expansion generate activated effector cells followed by
activation-induced clonal deletion responding cells. loss of
responding cells post-activation death apoptosis major factor
regulating immune homeostasis, precise pathways involved downsizing of
plasmodium falciparum antigen-induced cell expansions well
characterized. report study splenic cd4(+) cells mice
immunized nonreplicating immunogens like ova recombinant blood stage p.
falciparum antigens, pfmsp-3 pfmsp-1(19) crude parasite antigen (pfag)
undergo sequential cell activation, proliferation followed by
activation-induced cell death (aicd) dose- time-dependent manner after
ag restimulation. pfmsp-3 ova-induced aicd mediated death
receptor-dependent apoptotic program, pfmsp-1(19) pfag-induced aicd via a
mechanism dependent activation mitochondria apoptosis signalling
pathway bax activation. results provide insights mechanism
through two blood stage merozoite antigens trigger different apoptotic
programs aicd splenic cd4(+) cells.
