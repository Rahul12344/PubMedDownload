cytauxzoonosis, caused protozoan parasite, cytauxzoon felis, a
tick-borne disease domestic cats causing high mortality. reservoir wild
felids. study, 7 archived cases disease examined in
situ hybridization localization parasite immunohistochemistry
for various cell markers characterize infected cells. riboprobe used was
specific 16s-like rrna subunit babesia microti, shares 91%
identity gene c. felis. situ hybridization highlighted the
presence organism several tissues, prominently lung spleen,
and, general, 2 10 times infected cells seen situ
hybridization he. parasite-laden cells usually found within
vessels. cells often tightly packed frequently formed parasitic
thrombi. immunohistochemistry antilysozyme antibody confirmed the
macrophage origin infected cells. using antibody specific for
calprotectin (mac387), parasitized cells markedly devoid protein,
which may explain lack diapedesis vascular crowding parasitized
cells, providing circulating parasites tick vector.
immunohistochemical labeling 2 proliferation markers, proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (pcna) p53, indicated parasitized cells a
heightened replicative ability, probably additional parasite-driven
modification facilitate survival transmission.
