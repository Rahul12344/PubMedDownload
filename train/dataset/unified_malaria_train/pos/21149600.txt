hypoxia feature microenvironment number chronic inflammatory 
conditions due increased metabolic activity disrupted perfusion the
inflamed site. hypoxia contributes inflammation regulation gene
expression via key oxygen-sensitive transcriptional regulators including the
hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) nf-κb. recent studies revealed high
degree interdependence hif nf-κb signaling; however, relative 
contribution hypoxia-induced inflammatory gene expression remains
unclear. study, use transgenic mice expressing luciferase the
control nf-κb demonstrate hypoxia activates nf-κb heart and
lungs mice vivo. using small interfering rna targeted p65 subunit of
nf-κb, confirm unidirectional dependence hypoxic hif-1α accumulation upon
an intact canonical nf-κb pathway cultured cells. cyclooxygenase-2 other
key proinflammatory genes transcriptionally induced hypoxia manner
that hif-1 nf-κb dependent, mouse embryonic fibroblasts
lacking intact canonical nf-κb pathway, loss hypoxia-induced
inflammatory gene expression. finally, conditions hypoxia, hif-1α and
the p65 subunit nf-κb directly bind cyclooxygenase-2 promoter. these
results implicate essential role nf-κb signaling inflammatory gene
expression response hypoxia regulation hif-1 and
through direct effects upon target gene expression.
