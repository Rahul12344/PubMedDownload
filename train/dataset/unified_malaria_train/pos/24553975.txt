canine babesiosis tick-borne disease caused parasites genus
babesia. tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) cytokine plays role 
the pathogenesis canine babesiosis. study, authors determined 
concentration serum tnf-α 11 dogs infected babesia canis and
calculated spearman's rank correlations concentration tnf-α and
blood pressure, tnf-α indices renal damage as: fractional
excretion sodium (fe(na(+))), urinary creatinine serum creatinine ratio
(ucr/scr), renal failure index (rfi), urine specific gravity (usg) urinary
protein urinary creatinine ratio (upc). results demonstrated statistically
significant strong negative correlations tnf-α systolic arterial
pressure (r = -0.7246), diastolic arterial pressure (r = -0.6642) mean
arterial pressure (r = -0.7151). serum tnf-α concentration also statistically
significantly correlated fe(na(+)) (r = 0.7056), ucr/scr (r = -0.8199), usg 
(r = -0.8075) duration disease (r = 0.6767). results study
show increase serum tnf-α concentration canine babesiosis, 
and increased tnf-α concentration influence development of
hypotension renal failure canine babesiosis. probably results from
the fact tnf-α involved production nitric oxide induction
of vasodilation hypotension, may cause renal ischaemia hypoxia, and
finally acute tubular necrosis renal failure.
