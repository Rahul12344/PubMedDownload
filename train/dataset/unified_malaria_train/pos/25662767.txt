malaria parasites replicating inside red blood cells (rbcs) export large subset
of proteins erythrocyte cytoplasm facilitate parasite growth and
survival. ptex, parasite-encoded translocon, mediates protein transport
across parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (pvm) plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes. proteins exported erythrocyte
cytoplasm localized membranous structures, maurer's clefts, 
small vesicles, tubovesicular network. comparable studies protein
trafficking plasmodium vivax-infected reticulocytes limited. with
plasmodium yoelii-infected reticulocytes, identified exported protein 2 (exp2)
in proteomic screen proteins putatively transported across pvm.
immunofluorescence studies showed p. yoelii exp2 (pyexp2) primarily
localized pvm. unexpectedly, pyexp2 also associated distinct,
membrane-bound vesicles reticulocyte cytoplasm. contrast p. 
falciparum mature rbcs, p. falciparum exp2 (pfexp2) exclusively
localized pvm. two p. yoelii-exported proteins, py04481 (encoded a
pyst-a gene) py06203 (pypag-1), partially colocalized these
pyexp2-positive vesicles. analysis revealed p. yoelii,
plasmodium berghei, p. falciparum, cytoplasmic exp2-positive vesicles were
primarily observed cd71(+) reticulocytes versus mature rbcs. transgenic p. 
yoelii 17x parasites, association hemagglutinin-tagged pyexp2 pvm
and cytoplasmic vesicles retained, pyexp2 gene refractory to
deletion. data suggest localization exp2 mouse human
rbcs influenced host cell environment. exp2 may function at
multiple points pathway parasites traffic proteins and
through reticulocyte cytoplasm.
