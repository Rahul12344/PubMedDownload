the aim present study evaluate status plasma essential trace 
elements selenium (se), zinc (zn), copper (cu), iron (fe) concentrations 
their related acute-phase proteins, ceruloplasmin (cp), ferritin, transferrin
(tf), albumin levels patients vivax malaria. plasma cu zn
concentrations determined atomic absorption spectrometry (aas). se
concentrations determined graphite furnace aas. fe, cp, tf, albumin
levels determined colorimetric methods. plasma se, fe, albumin levels
were found significantly lower (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.05,
respectively) cu, cp, ferritin levels cu/zn ratios significantly
higher (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively) patients 
when compared healthy subjects. plasma, tf, zn levels 
found significantly different (p > 0.05) patients controls. there
were positive important correlations cu cp (r = 0.908, p < 0.001), zn
and albumin (r = 0.633, p < 0.001), negative correlations fe and
ferritin content (r = -0.521, p < 0.05) fe tf (r = -0.616, p < 0.01) in
the patients group. findings demonstrated plasma essential trace
elements se, cu, fe change, changes might dependent on
acute-phase proteins, regulated part defense strategies the
organism, induced hormonelike substances.
