the apicomplexan parasite theileria annulata transforms infected host cells,
inducing uncontrolled proliferation clonal expansion parasitized cell 
population. shortly sporozoite entry target cell, surrounding 
host cell membrane dissolved array host cell microtubules (mts)
surrounds parasite, develops transforming schizont. latter
does egress invade transform cells. instead, remains tethered
to host cell mts and, mitosis cytokinesis, engages cell's astral
and central spindle mts secure distribution two daughter
cells. molecular mechanism schizont recruits stabilizes host
cell mts known. mt minus ends mostly anchored mt organizing
center, plus ends explore cellular space, switching constantly
between phases growth shrinkage (called dynamic instability). assuming the
plus ends growing mts provide first point contact parasite, we
focused complex protein machinery associated structures. now
report schizont recruits end-binding protein 1 (eb1), central component
of mt plus end protein interaction network key regulator host cell mt 
dynamics. using range vitro experiments, demonstrate t. annulata 
p104, polymorphic antigen expressed schizont surface, functions a
genuine eb1-binding protein recruit eb1 absence other
parasite proteins. binding strictly depends consensus sxip motif located 
a highly disordered c-terminal region p104. show parasite

description pathogen-encoded protein interact eb1 via bona-fide
sxip motif. findings provide important new insight mode of
