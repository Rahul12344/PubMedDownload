the levels nuclear transcription factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) subunits p65 and
p50 associated kinase, inhibitory kappa b kinase (ikk) alpha beta
were monitored cytosolic nuclear fraction mice cerebral cortex and
cerebellum using experimental model fatal murine cerebral malaria (fmcm).
since protein kinase c (pkc) protein tyrosine kinases (ptk) known to
collaborately regulate nf-kappab activation, also studied activity 
these two kinases cytosol membrane fraction. parallel, levels of
two pkc isoforms (alpha delta) tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were
monitored correlate observed changes activity. results
underscore involvement ikk-beta essential mediator nf-kappab
activation evinced nuclear translocation p65 p50 cm
pathology. additional findings confirm altered activity levels pkc and
enhanced activation ptk tyrosine phosphorylation proteins cm
pathology. signaling intricacies involving interplay rel family 
(nf-kappab) transcription factors, pkc ptk may serve important cue
in understanding possible continuation post receptor signaling events
