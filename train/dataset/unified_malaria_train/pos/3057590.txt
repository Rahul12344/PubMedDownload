serum pools mice undergoing lethal infection plasmodium berghei inhibit
the growth il2-dependent mouse cytotoxic cell line (ctll). partially
purified preparation inhibitory factor specifically inhibited il2-mediated
events il2-dependent ctll growth con mitogenic response of
normal mouse spleen cells. production response il1, well growth
of myeloma lines, affected. administration partially purified
preparation normal mice resulted significant depression il2
production, thereby indicating role inhibitory factor maintaining
immune depression malaria-infected mice.
