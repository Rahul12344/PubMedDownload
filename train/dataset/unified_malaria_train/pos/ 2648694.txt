using improved procedure pulsed field gel electrophoresis, yeast
chromosomes separated wide range molecular size (250-4000 kbp) 
single gels. chromosomal dna patterns species belonging the
genus kluyveromyces examined. within species k. marxianus, varieties
lactis, drosophilarum vanudenii showed closely related patterns: very
different them, varieties bulgaricus marxianus related 
other, forming distinct group; strains commonly called 'k. lactis' 'k. 
fragilis' unambiguously different chromosome patterns.
these differences correlated presence characteristic repetitive 
sequence elements mitochondrial dna former group the
latter. analysis candida macedoniensis, considered an
anamorph k. marxianus var. marxianus, showed two yeast species were
indeed similar chromosome patterns mitochondrial dna restriction
patterns.
