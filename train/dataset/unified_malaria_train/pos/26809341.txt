protective vaccination induces self-healing otherwise lethal blood-stage
infections plasmodium chabaudi malaria. here, investigate mrna expression
patterns 12 members toll-like receptor (tlr) gene family the
liver, major effector organ blood-stage malaria, lethal and
vaccination-induced self-healing infections p. chabaudi female balb/c mice.
gene expression microarrays reveal 12 tlr genes constitutively
expressed, though varying levels, specifically respond infection.
protective vaccination affect constitutive expression 12
tlr genes leads differential expression (p < 0.05) seven tlrs (1, 2, 4,
7, 8, 12, 13) response malaria. quantitative pcr substantiates
differential expression p < 0.01. increased expression tlr2 
approximately five-fold day 1 post-infection (p.i.) tlr1 approximately 
threefold day 4 p.i.. peak parasitemia day 8 p.i., none 12 tlrs
display differential expression. peak parasitemia, towards end of
the crisis phase day 11 p.i., expression tlrs 1, 4, 12 increased 
approximately four-, two-, three-fold, respectively, tlr7 is
decreased approximately two-fold. collectively, data suggest though
all 12 members tlr gene family specifically responsive malaria in
the liver, tlr2 early stage infection also tlrs 1, 4, 
7, 12 towards end crisis phase critical vaccination-induced
resolution survival otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria.
