t. annulata, causative agent tropical theileriosis cattle, also
infect ovine caprine leukocytes vitro. vivo studies showed this
parasite causes mild infection animal species, sheep
merozoite stage development seems inhibited. since nature t.
annulata infected caprine ovine cells known, three cell lines were
karyotyped phenotypically characterized flow cytometry. express
mrna cytokines il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-8, tnf-alpha, of
ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4. contrast, il-6 mrna expressed cattle
cell line only, mrna il-10 exclusively produced sheep cell
line. observed differences cytokine mrna expression may responsible for
the different pathogenesis t. annulata infection cattle sheep.
