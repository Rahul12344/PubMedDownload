we examined process theileria parva sporozoite entry susceptible
bovine lymphocytes begun identify one possible molecular
interactions involved process. entry process involves defined series
of events used number experimental procedures combination
with method quantitation examine various aspects process. t.
parva sporozoites nonmotile organisms initial sporozoite-lymphocyte
interaction chance event occur 0-2 degrees c. subsequent
stages process temperature dependent, require participation of
live intact sporozoites host cells, involve cytochalasin-inhibitable
rearrangement host cell surface membrane cytoskeleton. sporozoite entry
can inhibited antibodies (mabs) reactive major histocompatibility
complex (mhc) class molecules (il-a 19, il-a 88) beta 2 microglobulin 
(b1g6), whereas mabs reactive mhc class ii molecules (il-a 21, j 11), 
common panleucocyte surface antigen, (il-a 87; bovine equivalent cd 11a)
have effect. results indicate mhc class molecules play role 
the process t. parva sporozoite entry bovine lymphocytes although yet 
the precise role determined. internalized within the
lymphocyte, process takes less 3 min 37 degrees c, sporozoite 
rapidly escapes encapsulating host cell membrane; process occurs
concurrently discharge contents sporozoite rhoptries and
microspheres. intracytoplasmic parasite covered layer of
sporozoite-derived fuzzy material host cell microtubules rapidly become 
associated.
