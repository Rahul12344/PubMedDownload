immune-mediated pathology interleukin-10 (il-10)-deficient mice during
blood-stage malaria infection typically manifests nonlymphoid organs, 
the liver lung. thus, critical define cellular sources il-10 
in sensitive nonlymphoid compartments infection. moreover, is
important determine il-10 production controlled conserved or
disparate molecular programs distinct anatomical locations malaria
infection, may enable spatiotemporal tuning regulatory immune
response. study, using dual gamma interferon (ifn-γ)-yellow fluorescent
protein (yfp) il-10-green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter mice, show
that cd4(+) yfp(+) cells major source il-10 lymphoid and
nonlymphoid compartments throughout course blood-stage plasmodium yoelii
infection. mature splenic cd4(+) yfp(+) gfp(+) cells, preferentially
expressed high levels ccr5, capable migrating seeding the
nonlymphoid tissues, indicating systemically distributed host-protective
cells common developmental history. despite exhibiting comparable
phenotypes, cd4(+) yfp(+) gfp(+) cells liver lung produced
significantly larger quantities il-10 splenic counterparts, showing
that cd4(+) yfp(+) gfp(+) cells exert graded functions distinct tissue
locations infection. unexpectedly, given unique environmental
conditions within discrete nonlymphoid lymphoid organs, show il-10
production cd4(+) yfp(+) cells controlled systemically malaria
infection il-27 receptor signaling supported cd4(+) cell 
priming icos signaling. results study substantially improve our
understanding systemic il-10 response malaria infection, particularly
within sensitive nonlymphoid organs.
