splenomegaly one typical symptoms malaria. however, pathogenesis
of splenic enlargement still remains unclear. spleen major organ for
clearance malaria parasites, excessive response parasites lead 
to splenomegaly. myeloid-related protein (mrp) 8 mrp14 expressed by
myeloid cells regarded marker proteins immature inflammatory
subtype macrophage. previous studies demonstrated accumulation of
mrp8(+) mrp14(+) macrophages associated pathological changes
associated various inflammatory diseases. order elucidate whether
mrp8(+) mrp14(+) cells also involved splenomegaly malaria, we
investigated expression mrp8 mrp14 spleens mice infected with
plasmodium berghei. mrp8 mrp14 levels serum analyzed by
western blot, confirmed proteins elevated infection 
compared uninfected controls. enlargement spleen prominent at
7days infection, histological analysis spleens demonstrated
deposition malaria pigments accumulation mononuclear cells.
immunohistochemical staining tissue revealed accumulation cells
expressing mrp8 mrp14. addition, locations cells overlapped
with cd11b(+) cells red pulp. results suggest splenomegaly in
malaria partly due accumulation mrp8(+) mrp14(+) macrophages.
