the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family plays 
central role antigenic variation cytoadhesion p. falciparum infected
erythrocytes. pfemp1 proteins/var genes classified three main
subfamilies (upsa, upsb, upsc) hypothesized different roles 
in binding disease. investigate whether subfamilies diverged in
binding specificity test binding could predicted adhesion domain
classification, generated panel 19 parasite lines primarily
expressed single dominant var transcript assayed binding 12 known
host receptors. limited dilution cloning, upsb upsc var genes were
isolated, indicating upsa var gene expression rare vitro culture
conditions. consequently, three upsa variants obtained rosette
purification selection specific monoclonal antibodies create more
representative panel. binding assays showed cd36 common
adhesion partner parasite panel, followed icam-1 tsp-1, that
cd36 icam-1 binding variants highly predicted adhesion domain
sequence classification. binding host receptors, including csa, vcam-1, 
habp1, cd31/pecam, e-selectin, endoglin, cho receptor "x", fractalkine, was
rare absent. findings identify category larger pfemp1 proteins that
are dual selection icam-1 cd36 binding. also support 
upsa group, contrast upsb upsc var genes, diverged binding 
the major microvasculature receptor cd36 likely uses mechanisms to
sequester microvasculature. results demonstrate cd36 icam-1
have left strong signatures selection pfemp1 family be
detected adhesion domain sequence classification implications how
this family proteins specializing exploit hosts varying levels of
anti-malaria immunity.
