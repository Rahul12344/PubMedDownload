glycophorin major transmembrane sialoglycoprotein red blood cells. it
has shown contribute expression mn wright blood group
antigens, act receptor malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum and
sendai virus, along anion transporter, band 3, may contribute the
mechanical properties red blood cell membrane. several lines evidence
suggest close interaction glycophorin band 3 their
biosynthesis. recently, generated mice band 3 expression was
completely eliminated selective inactivation ae1 anion exchanger gene, 
thus allowing us study effect band 3 expression red blood
cell membrane proteins. report, show band 3 -/- red blood
cells contain protein 4.1, adducin, dematin, p55, glycophorin c. contrast,
the band 3 -/- red blood cells completely devoid glycophorin (gpa), as
assessed western blot immunocytochemistry techniques, whereas the
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) confirmed presence gpa mrna. pulse-label
and pulse-chase experiments show gpa incorporated membrane and
is rapidly degraded cytoplasm. based findings published
evidence, propose band 3 plays chaperone-like role, necessary 
for recruitment gpa red blood cell plasma membrane.
