cerebral malaria associated circulating levels tumour necrosis
factor alpha (tnf-α) transforming growth factor β (tgf-β), association
between two cytokines implications splenocyte apoptosis remain
largely obscured. evaluated outcome tgf-β tnf-α production 
the context splenocyte apoptosis plasmodium berghei anka (pba)
infection. blood-stage pba infection confirmed blood-brain barrier disruption,
disarray white pulp, increase percentage sub-g0/g1 splenocyte
apoptosis. flow cytometric analysis reveals up-regulation fas-l followed by
caspase-8 caspase-3 activation signifies possible involvement of
fas-l-mediated splenocyte apoptosis. observed down-regulation tgf-β
and up-regulation tnf-α tissue serum level, respectively, pba
infection. association production tgf-β severity of
malaria infection splenocytes verified tgf-β inhibitor that
exacerbated apoptotic process. contrary, tnf-α inhibitor causes
significant delay apoptotic process, could alter lethality of
parasite. thus, results study suggest critical balance between
tgf-β tnf-α might key role fas-l-mediated splenocyte apoptosis
during experimental cerebral malaria.
