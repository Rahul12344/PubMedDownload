the primary clinical symptom japanese bovine theileriosis, caused the
intraerythrocytic protozoan theileria sergenti, anemia, underlying
mechanism anemia remains unknown. elucidate pathogenesis anemia
developing bovine theileriosis, investigated relationship between
oxidative bursts peripheral blood phagocytes (neutrophils monocytes) and
the oxidation red blood cells (rbc) development anemia cattle
experimentally infected t. sergenti. levels methemoglobin (methb) and
malondialdehyde (mda), parameter intracellular membrane oxidative
damage rbc production hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) phagocytes, were
low onset anemia; parameters began increase remarkably
with decreasing packed cell volume increasing parasitemia course
of anemia, returned initial levels convalescence anemia.
a positive correlation h2o2 production phagocytes the
oxidative indices methb mda also noted onset anemia. the
levels antioxidants, namely reduced glutathione glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, rbc also decreased progression anemia. these
results suggest oxidative damage rbc close relationship the
onset anemia bovine theileriosis, oxidative bursts phagocytes
may play part pathogenesis anemia infected cattle.
