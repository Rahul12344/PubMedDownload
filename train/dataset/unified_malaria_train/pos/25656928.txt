background: plasmodium knowlesi identified fifth major malaria
parasite humans. presents severe clinical symptoms leads mortality
as result hyperparasitemia short period time. study aimed to
improve current understanding p. knowlesi identify potential
biomarkers knowlesi malaria.
methods: present study, employed two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis-coupled immunoblotting techniques mass spectrometry to
identify novel circulating markers sera p. knowlesi-infected patients.
specifically, compared serum protein profiles p. knowlesi-infected
patients healthy p. vivax-infected individuals.
results: identified several immunoreactive proteins malarial-infected
subjects, including alpha-2-hs glycoprotein (ahsg), serotransferrin (tf),
complement c3c (c3), hemopexin (hpx), zinc-2-alpha glycoprotein (zag1),
apolipoprotein a1 (apo-a1), haptoglobin (hap), alpha-1-b-glycoprotein (a1bg).
however, tf hpx displayed enhanced antigenicity specificity,
suggesting might represent valid markers detecting p. knowlesi
infection. additionally, six p. knowlesi-specific antigens identified (k15, 
k16, k28, k29, k30, k38). moreover, although hap antigenicity observed
during p. vivax infection, undetectable p. knowlesi-infected subjects.
conclusions: demonstrated application immunoproteomics approach to
identify potential candidate biomarkers knowlesi malaria infection.
