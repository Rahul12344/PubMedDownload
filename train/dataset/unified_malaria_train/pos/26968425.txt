interleukin-27 (il-27) heterodimeric regulatory cytokine il-12
family, produced macrophages, dendritic cells, b cells upon
stimulation innate immune receptors. here, described regulatory cd4(+)
t cells produce il-27 response cell receptor stimulation during
malaria infection, inhibiting il-2 production clonal expansion t
cells il-27-dependent manner. il-27-producing cd4(+) cells were
foxp3(-)cd11a(+)cd49d(+) malaria antigen-specific cd4(+) cells were
distinct interferon-γ (ifn-γ) producing th1 il-10 producing tr1 cells. in
mice lacking il-27 cells, il-2 production restored clonal expansion 
and ifn-γ production specific cd4(+) cells improved, culminating in
reduced parasite burden. study highlights unique population il-27
producing regulatory cd4(+) cells critical role regulation 
the protective immune response malaria parasites.
