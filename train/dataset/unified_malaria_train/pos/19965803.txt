background: severe malarial anaemia major cause mortality malaria.
although enormous relevance, pathogenesis largely unknown.
interestingly, extent anaemia greatly exceeds loss erythrocytes due
to direct destruction pathogen plasmodium falciparum. immune response
against parasite partially mediated fc receptor for
immunoglobulin (ig) g iia (fcgammariia, cd32). presence arginine
instead histidine residue amino acid position 131 (h131r) the
extracellular domain fcgammariia reduces affinity receptor for
igg(2) igg(3) isotypes increases binding activity c reactive
protein (crp).
methods: ghana, west africa, 2504 children severe malaria 2027
matched healthy controls studied fcgammariia(h131r) polymorphism 
order ascertain influence major manifestations disease. the
study group included patients partly overlapping symptoms severe malaria,
among 1591 cases severe anaemia, 562 cases cerebral malaria, and
497 cases malaria complications.
results: analyses genotype distributions indicated that, recessive
model, fcgammariia(131rr) positively associated severe malaria
collectively (or 1.20, 95% ci 1.05 1.38; p=0.007, p(corrected)=0.021) and,
after stratification phenotypes, severe anaemia (or 1.33, 95% ci 1.13 to
1.57; p=0.001, p(corrected)=0.009), cerebral malaria (or 1.04, 95%
ci 0.82 1.33; p=0.733) malaria complications (or 1.03, 95% ci 0.78 to
1.37; p=0.827). association found levels parasitaemia.
conclusion: positive association crp binding variant fcgammariia
supports evidence role crp mediated defence mechanisms the
pathogenesis severe malarial anaemia.
