babesia ovis plays important role causing anemia kidney dysfunction 
affected animals. extensive studies hematological and
biochemical findings small ruminants' babesiosis caused b. ovis. aim of
this study evaluate effect babesiosis hematological and
biochemical parameters infected small ruminants b. ovis. total 280
sheep 122 goats 40 herds randomly examined presence b.
ovis blood samples. 402 samples, 67 animals (16.7%) positive b.
ovis 52 (18.5%) sheep 15 (12.2%) goats, respectively. the
infected animals divided four subgroups according parasitemia rates 
(<1%, 1%, 2%, 3%). control group, 67 uninfected animals also
selected farms. increase parasitemia rates, hemoglobin
concentration (hb), packed cell volume (pcv), red blood cells (rbcs), mean
corpuscular volume (mcv) mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (mchc)
significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while, total leukocyte count, number of
lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil eosinophil showed significant increase (p 
< 0.05). infected animals presented significant elevation (p < 0.05) total
proteins significantly lower level (p < 0.05) albumin compared to
non-infected animals. significant elevation (p < 0.05) bun, creatinine,
cholestrol, triglyceride, hdl ldl level found parasitemia
progression.
