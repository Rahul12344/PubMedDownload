chemokine antibody response profiles investigated children adults
with severe uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria; aim reveal
which profiles associated severe disease, often seen nonimmune
children, mild uncomplicated disease, seen semi-immune adults. 
blood samples obtained children 5 years age well adults 
with falciparum malaria. classification malaria performed according to
parasite densities hemoglobin concentrations. plasma levels chemokines
(il-8, ip-10, mcp-4, tarc, parc, mip-1δ, eotaxins) quantified, antibody 
responses (ige, igg1, igg4) p. falciparum, entamoeba histolytica-specific 
antigen, mite allergen extracts determined. children severe
malaria proinflammatory, il-8, ip10, mip-1δ, larc highly elevated
levels, suggesting association severe disease. contrast, th2-type 
chemokines tarc, parc, eotaxin-2 attained children levels in
adults suggesting evolution immune regulatory components. children with
severe malaria, elevated igg1 ige reactivity mite allergens and
intestinal protozoan parasites observed. conclusion, exacerbated
proinflammatory chemokines together ige responses mite allergens e.
histolytica-specific antigen extract observed children severe
falciparum malaria.
