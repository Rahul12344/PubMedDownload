background: plasmodium parasites typically elicit non-sterile protective
immune response human host populations, suggesting parasites actively
modulate normal immunological mechanisms. p-selectin cell surface receptor
expressed mammals, known component inflammatory response
against pathogens previously identified host factor that
influences malaria-associated pathology human patients rodent
infection models.
methods: better understand molecular mechanisms underlying involvement
of p-selectin pathogenesis malaria, systematic extracellular protein 
interaction screen used identify plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
protein 7 (msp7) binding partner human p-selectin. interaction, 
those occurring p-selectin plasmodium msp7 homologues, was
characterized biochemically.
results: plasmodium falciparum msp7 p-selectin shown bind 
directly via n-terminus pfmsp7 p-selectin c-type lectin and
egf-like domains. orthologous proteins murine parasite plasmodium berghei 
(pbmsrp1 pbmsrp2) mouse p-selectin also interacted. finally, p-selectin, 
when complexed msp7, could longer bind endogenous carbohydrate
ligand, sialyl-lewis(x).
conclusions: novel interactions identified plasmodium msp7 protein
family members host p-selectin receptors. since pfmsp7 could prevent
interactions p-selectin leukocyte ligands, results provide 
a possible mechanism known immunomodulatory effects msp7 and
p-selectin malaria infection models.
