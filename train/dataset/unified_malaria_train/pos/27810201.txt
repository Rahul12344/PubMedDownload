the aim study determine concentrations oxidative stress
parameters dna damage horses infected theileria equi. initial screening
of 110 horses duplex pcr enabled selection 30 infected horses t.
equi 30 free infection (control). specimens 60 horses were
further analysed determining following oxidative stress parameters: extent
of haemolysis (eh), plasma free haemoglobin (phb), catalase (cat), cu,zn
superoxide dismutase (sod1), paraoxonase (pon1), nitrite (no2-), total nitrate
and nitrite (nox), malondialdehyde (mda) free thiol groups (-sh). in
addition, relative distribution lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1-ldh5) activity and
the dna-damaging effects t. equi infection evaluated. compared control
horses, horses infected t. equi significantly higher sod1 activities
(p <0.05) phb (p <0.01), no2- (p <0.001), nox (p <0.05) mda
concentrations (p <0.001), significantly lower eh (p <0.001), cat (p <0.01)
and pon1 (p <0.001) activities, thiol group concentrations (p <0.05). the
comet assay demonstrated significantly increased dna damage t. equi infected
cells compared non-infected cells (p <0.001). infected horses had
significantly increased ldh5 isoenzyme activities (p <0.05). higher
production ros/rns t. equi-infected horses, resulted changes in
osmotic fragility, damage lipids, proteins dna, haemolysis and
hepatocellular damage. oxidative stress horses naturally infected t. equi
could contribute pathogenesis infection.
