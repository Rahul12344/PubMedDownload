background: mechanisms malaria down-regulates cyp activities 
are understood yet. also unclear whether cyp activities modulated
during non-lethal malaria infections. study undertaken evaluate the
time course cyp alterations lethal (plasmodium berghei anka) non-lethal
(plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi) murine malaria. additionally, hypotheses the
association cyp depression enhanced nitric oxide (no) production, 
cyp2a5 induction endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, enhanced haem metabolism
and oxidative stress examined well.
methods: female dba-2 c57bl/6 mice infected p.berghei anka p.
chabaudi killed different post-infection days. infection monitored 
parasitaemia rates clinical signs. levels measured serum.
activities cyp1a (ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase), 2b
(benzyloxyresorufin-o-debenzylase), 2a5 (coumarin-7-hydroxylase) and
uridine-diphosphoglucuronyl-transferase (ugt) determined liver
microsomes. glutathione-s-transferase (gst) activity concentrations of
gluthatione (gsh) thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (tbars) were
determined liver. levels glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78) were
evaluated immunoblotting, mrnas haemoxygenase-1 (ho-1) inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (inos) determined quantitative rt-pcr.
results: plasmodium berghei depressed cyp1a 2b induced 2a5 dba-2 mice.
in p.berghei-infected c57bl/6 mice cyp activities remained unaltered. both
strains, gst ugt affected p.berghei. plasmodium c. chabaudi
depressed cyp1a 2b induced 2a5 activities day peak parasitaemia
or near day. cyp2a5 induction associated over-expression ho-1
and enhanced oxidative stress, associated grp78 induction, 
marker endoplasmic reticulum stress. plasmodium chabaudi increased serum on
days near parasitaemia peak strains. although elevating serum no,
p.berghei enhanced inos mrna expression liver.
conclusion: down-regulation cyp1a 2b induction 2a5 occurred in
lethal non-lethal infections parasitaemia rates high. a
contribution depression cyp2b cannot ruled out. results were
consistent view cyp2a5 ho-1 concurrently up-regulated and
suggested cyp2a5 induction may occur absence enhanced endoplasmic 
reticulum stress.
