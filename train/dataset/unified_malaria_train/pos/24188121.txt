background: using microarray analysis, study showed up-regulation of
toll-like receptors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, nf-κb, tnf, p38-mapk, mhc molecules in
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following infection plasmodium
falciparum.
methods: analysis reports herein studies based time-course
microarray analysis focus malaria-induced host immune response.
results: results show early malaria, selected immune response-related
genes up-regulated including α β γ interferon-related genes, well 
genes il-15, cd36, chemokines (cxcl10, ccl2, s100a8/9, cxcl9, cxcl11),
trail igg fc receptors. acute febrile malaria, up-regulated genes
included α β γ interferon-related genes, il-8, il-1b il-10 downstream genes, 
tgfb1, oncostatin-m, chemokines, igg fc receptors, adcc signalling,
complement-related genes, granzymes, nk cell killer/inhibitory receptors fas 
antigen. recovery, genes nk receptors granzymes/perforin were
up-regulated. viewed terms immune response type, malaria infection
appeared induce mixed th1 response, α β interferon-driven
responses appear predominate classic il-12 driven pathway. in
addition, th17 pathway also appears play significant role immune
response p. falciparum. gene markers th17 (neutrophil-related genes, tgfb1 
and il-6 family (oncostatin-m)) thαβ (ifn-γ nk cytotoxicity adcc
gene) immune response up-regulated. initiation thαβ immune response was
associated ifn-αβ response, ultimately resulted moderate-mild
ifn-γ achieved via pathway different classic il-12 th1 pattern.
conclusions: based observations, study speculates p.
falciparum infection, thαβ/th17 immune response may predominate ideal th1
response.
