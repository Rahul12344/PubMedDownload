we previously reported major expanding lymphocytes intermediate tcr
(tcr(int)) cells (mainly nk1.1(-)) malarial infection mice. cell
transfer experiments tcr(int) cells indicated cells mediated
resistance malaria. however, tcr(int) cells always contain nk1.1(+)tcr(int)
cells (i.e., nkt cells) controversial results (nkt cells effective or
not resistance malaria) reported different investigators. 
this study, used cd1d((-/-)) mice, almost completely lack nkt cells in
the liver immune organs. parasitemia prolonged blood of
cd1d((-/-)) mice expansion lymphocytes liver mice 
more prominent injection plasmodium yoelii-infected erythrocytes.
however, mice finally recovered malaria. contrast b6 mice,
cd4(-)8(-) nkt cells well nk1.1(-)cd3(int) cells expanded cd1d((-/-))
mice malarial infection, instead cd4(+) (and cd8(+)) nkt cells. these
newly generated cd4(-)8(-)nkt cells cd1d((-/-)) mice use invariant 
chain valpha14jalpha281 tcralpha. evidence severe thymic
atrophy autoantibody production accompanied malarial infection,
irrespective mice used. results suggest nk1.1(-) and
nk1.1(+) subsets tcr(int) cells (i.e., constituents innate immunity) are
associated resistance malaria autoimmune-like state is
induced malarial infection.
