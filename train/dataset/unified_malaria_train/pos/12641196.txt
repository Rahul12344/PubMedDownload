leptin, involved range physiological processes, could an
important factor pathogenesis malaria. found levels leptin
in serum urine plasmodium berghei-infected mice increased progressively
after infection, reaching maximum value day 6 post-infection. serum values
were approximately five-fold higher infected mice non-infected
controls. similar relation found values leptin urine. soluble
leptin receptor levels also increased significantly serum, less in
line leptin increase. work represents first report visibly
augmented leptin soluble leptin receptor secretion malarial infection.
