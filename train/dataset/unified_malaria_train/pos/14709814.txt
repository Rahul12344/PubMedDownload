erythrocyte 5'-nucleotidase thought involved maturation of
erythrocytes. present study, vitro incubation canine erythrocytes
demonstrated significant inhibition 5'-nucleotidase activity occurred 
the presence serum dogs infected babesia gibsoni, enzyme
was assayed cytidine 5'-monophosphate (5'-cmp) inosine 5'-monophosphate 
(5'-imp) substrates. multiplication b. gibsoni vitro culture also
resulted significant decrease enzyme activity erythrocytes 
culture. furthermore, infected serum 5'-cmp retarded maturation of
canine reticulocytes vitro. results suggested nucleotides as
5'-cmp 5'-imp might accumulate young erythrocytes and/or serum dogs
infected b. gibsoni result decreased activity erythrocyte
5'-nucleotidase, resulting delayed maturation reticulocytes.
