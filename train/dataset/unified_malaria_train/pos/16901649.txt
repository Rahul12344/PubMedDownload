to assess antioxidant status oxidative stress bovine theileriosis due 
to theileria annulata blood samples collected 35 clinically affected
cattle referred veterinary teaching hospital, school veterinary medicine,
urmia university, urmia, iran. complete blood count, piroplasm parasitemia
percentage, erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase
and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, malondialdehyde concentration, 
osmotic fragility test median corpuscular fragility determined the
results compared 50 healthy controls. 35 affected cattle,
12 (34.28%) severe anemia 23 mild moderate anemia parasitemia 
varied 5 40%. activities erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase,
superoxide dismutase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly
lower (p<0.0001) activity catalase significantly higher the
affected cattle healthy ones (p<0.001). malondialdehyde concentration 
erythrocytes affected cattle significantly healthy
cattle (p<0.001). affected cattle showed increased fragility erythrocytes,
so median corpuscular fragility (mcf) affected group significantly
lower healthy group (p<0.0001). median corpuscular fragility showed
a positive correlation severity parasitemia (r=0.81, p<0.0005) 
negative correlation activities gsh-px (r=-0.78, p<0.0001), sod
(r=-0.71, p<0.0005), catalase (r=-0.53, p<0.018) g6pd (r=-0.58, p<0.0005).
the results study suggest oxidative damage rbcs may contribute to
the pathogenesis anemia bovine theileriosis.
