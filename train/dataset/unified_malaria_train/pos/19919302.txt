background: molecular mechanisms involved pathogenesis severe
plasmodium falciparum malaria-specifically, cerebral malaria-are still unclear.
transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) family members important
regulators inflammation influence malaria pathogenesis. soluble form 
of auxiliary receptor endoglin (seng) may play role malaria
pathogenesis.
methods: serum levels seng measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent-assay gabonese children cerebral malaria (n = 7) severe
malaria (n = 43), uncomplicated malaria (n = 43) compared levels
in healthy control subjects (n = 25) another infectious disease group (n =
8).
results: serum seng levels higher patients cerebral malaria 
patients severe malaria compared levels patients other
infection group healthy control group. furthermore, seng correlated
significantly disease severity. 7% patients uncomplicated
malaria none control patients (patients infection group
or healthy control group) serum levels higher 12 ng/ml, whereas this
was found 85.7% patients cerebral malaria 46.5% patients with
severe malaria.
conclusions: high seng levels may attenuate anti-inflammatory response resulting 
in clinical deterioration patients p. falciparum malaria. results
further corroborate role vascular compartment, especially the
endothelium, severe malaria pathogenesis.
