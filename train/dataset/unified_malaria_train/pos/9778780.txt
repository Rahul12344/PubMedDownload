administration ground-up tick tissue stabilate (0.75 tick equivalent) the
subcutaneous route crossbred calves aged 1 week 1 month led the
development acute theileriosis. haematological studies revealed significant
progressive decreases haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume red
blood cell count, whereas total leukocyte count showed initial
non-significant leukocytosis followed significant leukopenia. analysis of
serum revealed significant increases levels alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase and
gamma-glutamyltransferase, concentrations uric acid, blood urea
nitrogen bilirubin. concentrations total protein, albumin, glucose,
cholesterol calcium showed non-significant decreases, phosphorus
decreased significantly terminal stages disease.
