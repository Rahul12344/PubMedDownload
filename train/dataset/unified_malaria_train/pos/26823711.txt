synapsin neuronal phosphoprotein contained synaptic vesicles of
mammalian central peripheral nervous systems. regulates both
neurotransmitter release synaptic formation. variations synapsin i
expression brain reported cause brain malfunction. severe 
malaria, neurological complications, convulsion, delirium coma,
suggest abnormalities release neurotransmitters. study evaluated
synapsin expression cerebral malaria (cm). immunohistochemical method was
used study semi-quantitative qualitative expression synapsin in
the brain cm patients (10 cases) died plasmodium falciparum, compared
with non-cerebral malaria (ncm) (4 cases), control brain tissues (5).
synapsin expressed gray matter cerebral cortex the
molecular layer cerebellum, diffusely dense precipitate pattern in
the neuropil, immunoreactivity neurons, neuronal dendrites, glial 
cells, endothelial cells, purkinje cells. findings similarly
demonstrated cm, ncm, control brain tissues. however, granular
layer cerebellum, significant increase synapsin expression was
observed granule cells, glomerular synaptic complex, cm
group, compared ncm, control brain tissues (all p < 0.05).
parasitemia showed positive correlation synapsin expression the
granule cells (on admission: spearman's ρ = 0.600, p = 0.023) (before death:
spearman's ρ = 0.678, p = 0.008), glomerular synaptic complex (before death: 
spearman's ρ = 0.571, p = 0.033). hypothesized cm causes pre-synaptic
excitation eventually activation synapsin i, leading increased
neurotransmitter release. synapsin inhibitor investigated 
a target therapeutic intervention alleviate neurological symptoms in
severe malaria.
