the malignant ovine theileriosis caused theileria lestoquardi, is
highly pathogenic sheep. theileriosis involves different organs ruminants, 
but effect disease cardiovascular system unclear. to
understand pathogenesis t. lestoquardi cardiovascular system,
baluchi breed sheep infected mentioned parasite releasing unfed 
adults hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, infected t.
lestoquardi. infected sheep clinically examined days 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 
12, 14, 17, 21, blood samples collected biochemical
parameters measurement. termination experiment, infected sheep were
euthanized pathological examinations heart tissue conducted. during
experimental infection sheep t. lestoquardi, activities cardiac
troponin (ctni), lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, were
significantly increased (p˂0.05), conspicuous decrease (p˂0.05) was
observed creatine phosphokinase activities. alterations made biochemical
factors almost coincided presence piroplasm blood schizont
in lymph nodes. maximum minimum parasitemia sheep stood between
3.3% 0.28%, respectively. addition, electrocardiography revealed sinus
tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, sino-atrial block st-elevation, atrial
premature beat, alteration qrs waves' amplitude. heart
histopathological examination showed hyperemia, infiltration mononuclear
inflammatory cells interstitial tissue, endocarditis, focal necrosis 
cardiac muscle cells. addition, one sheep, definite occurrence of
infarction observed. results indicate t. lestoquardi infection has
devastating pathological impacts cardiovascular system sheep.
furthermore, measurement ctni amount useful biochemical factor for
diagnosis better understanding severity progression the
disease effects cardiac tissue.
