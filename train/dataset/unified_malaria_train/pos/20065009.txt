in cerebral malaria, binding parasitized erythrocytes cerebral
endothelium consequent angiogenic dysregulation play key role in
pathogenesis. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) widely
regarded potent stimulator angiogenesis, edema, inflammation, and
vascular remodeling, plasma levels vegf soluble form vegf
receptor (svegfr)-1 -2 uncomplicated malaria patients healthy adults
were measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) examine roles
in malaria. results showed vegf svegfr-2 levels significantly
elevated malaria patients compared healthy adults. moreover, was
confirmed malarial parasite antigens induced vegf secretion human
mast cell lines hmc-1 ku812 cell. first report suggest the
interaction vegf svegfr-2 involved host immune response to
malarial infection malarial parasites induce vegf secretion human
mast cells.
