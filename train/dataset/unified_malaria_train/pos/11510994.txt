superoxide plays crucial role innate immunity various pathogens. we
examined role superoxides transmission malaria using gp91phox
knockout (x-cgd) mice lack ability produce superoxide. mosquitoes
that fed x-cgd mice infected intraperitoneally plasmodium berghei nk65
anka formed oocysts fed control mice day after
infection. number oocysts peaked day 5 post-infection x-cgd and
control mice decreased significantly day 5 post-infection.
however, day 7 post-infection, infectivity gametocytes x-cgd mice
was significantly higher control mice. results show two
pathways, superoxide-dependent -independent, involved host systems
regulating transmission malaria inhibiting gametocyte development.
