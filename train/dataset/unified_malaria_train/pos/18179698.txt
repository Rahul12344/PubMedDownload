background: cerebral malaria (cm) acute encephalopathy increased
pro-inflammatory cytokines, sequestration parasitized erythrocytes and
localized ischaemia. children cm induces cognitive impairment 10% 
the survivors. erythropoietin (epo) - besides well known
haematopoietic properties - significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
anti-apoptotic effects various brain disorders. neurobiological responses 
to exogenously injected epo murine cm examined.
methods: female c57bl/6j mice (4-6 weeks), infected plasmodium berghei anka,
were treated recombinant human epo (rhepo; 50-5000 u/kg/od, i.p.) at
different time points. effect survival measured. brain pathology was
investigated tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (tdt)-mediated
deoxyuridine triphosphate (dutp)-digoxigenin nick end labelling), marker 
apoptosis. gene expression brain tissue measured real time pcr.
results: treatment rhepo increased survival mice cm dose- and
time-dependent manner reduced apoptotic cell death neurons well 
expression pro-inflammatory cytokines brain. neuroprotective
effect appeared independent haematopoietic effect.
conclusion: results excellent safety profile humans makes rhepo 
a potential candidate adjunct treatment cm.
