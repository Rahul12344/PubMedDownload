the schizont stage protozoan parasite theileria annulata reversibly
transforms bovine monocytes immortalised metastatic state. have
been studying t. annulata induction host matrix metalloproteinases (mmp) which
are involved parasite dissemination pathogenesis. observed that
prolonged vitro culture t. annulata-infected cell lines results their
attenuation process associated alterations host and
parasite gene expression. particular, loss bovine mmp expression later
passage cultures suggests parasite-induced mmps virulence factors.
as means understanding attenuation process examine 
detail parasite-induced differential expression one particular bovine
proteinase, mmp9, non-attenuated (p58) attenuated (p158) passage levels of
the ode vaccine line. show mmp9 expression regulated the
transcriptional level suggest particular parasite-induced ap-1
recognition transcription factor present ode non-attenuated line may 
a role play expression host gene.
