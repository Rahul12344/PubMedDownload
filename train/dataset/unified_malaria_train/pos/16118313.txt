the 911 amino acid band 3 (slc4a1) major intrinsic membrane protein red
cells principal cl-/hco3- exchanger. n-terminal cytoplasmic domain
of band 3 anchors spectrin-based membrane skeleton lipid bilayer
through interaction ankyrin also binds glycolytic enzymes and
hemoglobin. identified son consanguineous marriage severe anemia
in association marked deficiency band 3 (12% +/- 4% normal). direct
nucleotide sequencing slc4a1 gene demonstrated single base substitution (t
--> c) position + 2 donor splice site intron 2, resulting the
generation novel mutant protein. biochemical characterization mutant 
protein showed lacked first 11 n-terminal amino acids (band 3
neapolis). expression mutant protein resulted complete absence 
of membrane-bound aldolase, mutant band 3 could tyrosine
phosphorylated. ability malarial parasite p falciparum invade these
red cells significantly decreased. identification novel band 3
mutant structural functional characterization enabled us identify 
pivotal roles 11 n-terminal amino acids several protein functions and,
in turn, red-cell physiology.
