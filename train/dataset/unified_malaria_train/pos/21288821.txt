background: mechanisms severe malarial anemia cerebral malaria, 
are extreme manifestations plasmodium falciparum malaria, fully
understood.
methods: children aged <6 years southern zambia presenting hospital
with severe malarial anemia (n = 72), cerebral malaria (n = 28), uncomplicated
malaria (n = 66) studied prospectively. children overlapping severe
anemia cerebral malaria excluded.
results: low interleukin 10 concentrations strongest association with
severe anemia (standard β = .61; p < .001) followed high tumor necrosis factor
α sfas concentrations, low weight-for-age z scores, presence stool
parasites, splenomegaly (standard β = .15-.25; p ≤ .031); these
factors also associated lower reticulocytes. greater parasitemia was
associated higher interleukin 10 tumor necrosis factor α concentrations,
whereas sulfadoxizole/pyrimethamine therapy lower weight-for-age z scores
were associated lower interleukin 10 levels. thrombocytopenia elevated
tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels strongest associations
with cerebral malaria (standard β = .37 .36; p < .0001), followed exposure 
to traditional herbal medicine hemoglobinuria (standard β = .21-.31; p ≤
.006).
conclusions: predictors severe malarial anemia (altered immune responses, poor
nutrition, intestinal parasites, impaired erythropoiesis) differed those
of cerebral malaria (thrombocytopenia, herbal medicine, intravascular
hemolysis). improved preventive therapeutic measures may need consider
these differences.
