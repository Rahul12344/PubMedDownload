when cells become infected parasite theileria parva, acquire a
transformed phenotype longer require antigen-specific stimulation or
exogenous growth factors. accompanied constitutive interleukin 2
(il-2) il-2 receptor expression. transformation reversed entirely by
elimination parasites using specific drug bw720c. extracellular
signal-regulated kinase jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) members the
mitogen-activated protein kinase family, play central role the
regulation cellular differentiation proliferation also participate 
the regulation il-2 il-2 receptor gene expression. t. parva found to
induce unorthodox pattern mitogen-activated protein kinase expression in
infected cells. jnk-1 jnk-2 constitutively active a
parasite-dependent manner, altered properties. contrast,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 activated even though its
activation pathway functionally intact. different components cell
receptor (tcr)-dependent signal transduction pathways also examined. the
tcrzeta cd3epsilon chains found phosphorylated t.
parva-transformed cells resistant inhibitors block early steps
of cell activation. compounds inhibit progression cells to
proliferation, however, inhibitory. data provide first example, to
our knowledge, parasite-mediated jnk activation, findings strongly
suggest t. parva lifts requirement antigenic stimulation
but also entirely bypasses early tcr-dependent signal transduction pathways to
induce continuous proliferation.
