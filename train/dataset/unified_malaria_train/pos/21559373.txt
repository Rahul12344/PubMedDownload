introduction: severe malaria attributed partly sequestration of
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies) microvasculature of
vital host organs. identification p. falciparum cytoadherence phenotypes 
are associated severe malaria may lead development novel
strategies life-threatening malaria.
methods findings: forty-six p. falciparum isolates mozambican children
under 5 years age severe malaria (cases) examined compared 46
isolates sex age matched mozambican children uncomplicated malaria 
(controls). cytoadherence properties platelet-mediated clumping,
rosetting adhesion purified receptors (cd36, icam1 gc1qr), were
compared matched pairs non-parametric tests. common
clinical presentation associated severe malaria prostration. compared to
matched controls, prevalence platelet-mediated clumping higher cases
(p = .019), children presenting prostration (p = .049) children
with severe anaemia (p = .025). prevalence rosetting gc1qr adhesion were
also higher isolates cases severe anemia multiple seizures,
respectively (p = .045 cases), controls.
conclusions: data indicate role platelet-mediated clumping, rosetting
and adhesion gc1qr pathogenesis severe malaria. inhibition 
cytoadherence phenotypes may reduce occurrence improve prognosis of
severe malaria outcomes.
