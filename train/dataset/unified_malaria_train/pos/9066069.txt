a lysate theileria sergenti-infected bovine red blood cells induced vitro
proliferation mouse spleen cells 2-3-day incubation period. experiments
using b cell-enriched preparations showed b cell (b220+ cd3-
population) responsible non-specific proliferation. culture
supernatant spleen cells stimulated lysate, considerable amounts of
interleukin 2 (il-2) gamma-interferon (ifn-gamma) revealed 2 days,
followed production immunoglobulin peak 4-6 days. thus, was
suggested lysate antigen(s) t. sergenti-infected red blood cells was
able stimulate mouse spleen cells produce il-2 ifn-gamma, turn
induced proliferation b cells production immunoglobulin.
