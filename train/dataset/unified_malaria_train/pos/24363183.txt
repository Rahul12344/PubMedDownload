immune response malaria infection complex seems regulated by
innate adaptive immune response well environmental factors host
genetics nutritional status. previously, reported α-tocopherol
transfer protein knockout (α-ttp(δ)) mice, showing low concentrations of
α-tocopherol circulation, infected plasmodium berghei nk65 survived
significantly longer compared wild-type mice. addition, plasmodium
yoelii xl-17, lethal strain, showed non-lethal virulence α-ttp(δ) mice.
thus, hypothesized ability α-ttp(δ) mice control p. yoelli 
xl-17 proliferation may allow build efficient immune response 
murine malaria infection. 15 days infection p. yoelli xl-17,
α-ttp(δ) mice challenged infection p. berghei nk65. results
indicated α-ttp(δ) mice infected p. yoelli xl-17 built protective
immunity p. berghei nk65 associated extremely low levels of
parasitemia, controlled inflammatory response, robust antibody response. 
moreover, importance α-tocopherol parasite proliferation was
remarkable. results suggest inhibition α-tocopherol transfer protein 
activity effective enhancement acquired immunity murine malaria 
infection.
