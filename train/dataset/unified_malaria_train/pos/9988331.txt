plasmodium falciparum malaria associated procoagulant activity not
with thromboembolism. measured coagulation factor xiii, i.e.,
fibrin-stabilizing factor, 45 patients falciparum malaria time. of
these, 22 organ complications. factor xiii antigen (subunits b) and
plasma activity levels abnormally low falciparum malaria. they
increased antiparasitic therapy. 14 22 patients complications, 
but patient mild disease (p < 0.001), subunit activity <
50%. factor x.iii levels inversely correlated clinical severity,
parasitemia, human neutrophil elastase (hne), with
thrombin-antithrombin iii levels. thus, low factor xiii levels may reflect
proteolysis hne, rather procoagulant activity. one could speculate that
factor xiii degradation severe malaria prevents thromboembolism. 
hand, factor xiii deficiency might reduce protection vascular endothelium 
against hne reactive oxygen species, would promote organ damage.
