theileria parva protozoan parasite infects bovine b cells alpha
beta gamma delta cells transforms continually proliferating
cells. cd4+ t. parva-antigen-specific immune cells shown produce
cytokines response stimulation parasitized cells, t.
parva-infected lymphocytes produce consume t-cell growth factors and
interleukin-2 (il-2). ascertain role t-cell cytokines t. parva
infections, evaluated recombinant gamma interferon (rifn-gamma), ril-2, and
tumor necrosis factor alpha (rtnf-alpha) effects establishment,
proliferation, survival parasitized cells. results indicate that
neither rifn-gamma rtnf-alpha enhancing inhibitory effect the
growth established t. parva-infected t-cell clones, whereas bovine ril-2
increased proliferation infected b-cell alpha beta t-cell clones but
not gamma delta t-cell clones. evaluate effects cytokines
on establishment parasitized cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were cultured presence immediately following infection t. parva
sporozoites. neither rifn-gamma ril-2 altered proportion cells
initially developing schizonts, enhanced establishment infected cell 
lines twofold. contrast, rtnf-alpha resulted 33% decrease 
in proportion schizont-infected cells. inhibitory effects establishment
of parasitized cell lines rtnf-alpha longer apparent 12 days
following infection. tests conducted study indicated t.
parva-infected lymphocytes also spontaneously produce ifn neutralized 
acidic ph treatment. conclusion, speculate none t-cell
cytokines likely profound inhibitory effect vivo t. parva
infections. instead, ifn-gamma il-2 may facilitate establishment of
infection t. parva.
