the marine invertebrate-derived meridianin a, originally proposed structure
for psammopemmin a, several related 3-pyrimidylindole analogs were
synthesized subsequently investigated central nervous system,
antimalarial, cytotoxic activity. suzuki coupling indoleborate ester 
to pyrimidine electrophile utilized form natural product and
derivatives thereof. 3-pyrimidineindoles found prevent radioligand
binding several cns receptors transporters, notably, serotonin
receptors (<0.2 μm k(i) 5ht(2b)). two compounds also inhibited human
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum (ic(50) <50 μm). natural product 
was cytotoxic toward a549 cells (ic(50)=15 μm).
