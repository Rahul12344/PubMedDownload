the malaria parasite liver stage produces tens thousands red
cell-infectious forms within host hepatocyte. thought the
vacuole-enclosed parasite completely depends host cell successful
development molecular parasite-host cell interactions underlying this
remarkable growth remained elusive. using yeast two-hybrid screen a
yeast overexpression system show uis3, parasite protein essential for
liver stage development, interacts directly liver-fatty acid binding
protein, l-fabp. down-regulation l-fabp expression hepatocytes severely
impairs parasite growth overexpression l-fabp promotes growth. the
first identified direct liver stage-host cell protein interaction, providing a
possible explanation importance uis3 liver infection.
