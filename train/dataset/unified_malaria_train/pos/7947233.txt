the mechanisms involved activation coagulation cascade severe
falciparum malaria studied 22 adult patients (19 male, three female) aged
18-45 (mean +/- sd 31 +/- 11) years. these, nine multiple vital organ
dysfunction, bleeding occurred four patients, two died. during
acute illness reduction plasma antithrombin iii (at iii) concentrations
and elevation thrombin-at iii complexes associated significant
reductions factor xii prekallikrein activities, increase c1 
inhibitor antigen/activity ratio. serial plasminogen activity remained within the
normal range patients protein c activity significantly reduced. 
all patients markedly elevated plasma polymorphonuclear leucocyte elastase
(pmn-elastase) levels mild depletion alpha-2 macroglobulin normal
concentrations alpha-1 antitrypsin. correlation between
pmn-elastase concentrations coagulation parameters or
concentrations proteinase inhibitors. results suggest intrinsic
pathway clotting cascade activated severe malaria. may cause
activation complement system release bradykinin pmn-elastase
and could contribute pathogenesis severe malaria.
