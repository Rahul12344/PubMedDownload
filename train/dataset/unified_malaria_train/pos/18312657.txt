background: malaria pregnancy characterized sequestration of
malaria-infected red blood cells (irbc) intervillous spaces the
placenta, often accompanied infiltration maternal mononuclear cells,
causing substantial maternal foetal/infant morbidity. irbc bind to
receptors expressed syncytiotrophoblast (st). st responds this
interaction remains poorly understood. known st is
immunoactive respond infectious agents, consequences this
st-irbc interaction investigated.
methods: vitro system used assess biochemical immunological 
changes induced st st-adherent irbcs. changes st mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) activation assessed immunoblotting mrna
expression levels selected cytokine chemokines primary st bound irbc
were determined using real-time, reverse transcription pcr. addition, secreted
cytokine chemokine proteins assayed standard elisa, chemotaxis of
pbmc assessed using two-chamber assay system.
results: following irbc/st interaction, st c-jun n-terminal kinase 1 (jnk1) was
activated modest increases mrna expression tgf-beta il-8/cxcl8 
were observed. addition, interaction increased secretion mif and
mip-1alpha/ccl3 st induced migration pbmc towards irbc-stimulated st.
conclusion: results study provide first evidence st
participates shaping local immunological milieu recruitment 
maternal immune cells maternal blood space placental malaria
