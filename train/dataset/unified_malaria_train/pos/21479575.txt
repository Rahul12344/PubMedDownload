malaria infection leads anemia humans generally occurs the
chronic phase infection. role erythropoietic molecules play for
anemia malaria low parasitemia levels still controversial due the
lack suitable animal models might mimic condition. regard, 
α-tocopherol transfer protein knockout mice, undetectable levels vitamin 
e circulation, possibly used model investigate role that
erythropoietic molecules erythropoietin (epo), erythropoietin receptor
(epor), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) play outcome of
anemia uncomplicated malaria infection low parasitemias. results
indicate degree parasitemia unlikely plays important effect on
mrna expression epo epor different organs. moreover, even though epo
and epor productions impaired kidney bone marrow, respectively,
other organs liver spleen intend compensate production of
these cytokines prevent anemia infected animals.
