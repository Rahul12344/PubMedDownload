1. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tccd)-induced lipid peroxidation has
previously demonstrated assessing hepatic content thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (tbars) well nadph-dependent microsomal
formation tbars well nadph-dependent microsomal formation tbars
using malondialdehyde standard. 2. changes membrane fluidity a
result lipid peroxidation may occur. therefore dose- time-dependent
effects tcdd lipid peroxidation mitochondrial, microsomal, plasma
membranes, changes membrane fluidity subcellular fractions, 
examined. animals treated either 50 100 micrograms tcdd/kg orally,
and killed 3, 6, 9 days post-treatment. 3. time-dependent increases occurred
in tbars content formation following tcdd administration three
membranes. similar results observed 50 100 micrograms tcdd/kg. 4. 
following tcdd administration, fluorescence polarization measurements as
determined fluorescence polarization (r) anisotropy parameter (a.p.)
values demonstrated significant decreases membrane fluidity membrane
fractions, indicative membrane structural alterations. 5. excellent inverse
correlations lipid peroxidation membrane fluidity observed.
thus, decreased membrane fluidity increased membrane damage may contribute to
the toxic manifestations tcdd consequence oxidative stress.
