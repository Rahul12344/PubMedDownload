terbinafine determined via high-performance liquid chromatography.
results: data 1 bird discarded possible error dose 
of drug administered. oral administration terbinafine, maximum
concentration remaining 5 fed birds ranged 109 671 ng/ml,
half-life ranged 6 13.5 hours, time maximum concentration
ranged 2 8 hours. adverse effects observed.
