asymptomatic malaria infections highly prevalent malaria endemic regions
and infections remain undiagnosed untreated. whereas
conventional malaria symptoms definition absent, little known the
more subtle health consequences infections. aim study 
analyze hematologic, vascular inflammatory effects patent and
subpatent asymptomatic malaria parasitemia children adults the
indonesian island sumba. children adults parasitemia increased 
high-sensitive c-reactive protein levels compared aparasitemic individuals. in
addition, children, adults parasitemia also lower platelet
counts hb levels higher levels von willebrand factor platelet
factor-4, markers endothelial platelet activation, respectively. these
findings suggest asymptomatic malaria infections subtle health
consequences, especially children, regarded potentially
