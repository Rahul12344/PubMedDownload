a tight regulation pro- anti-inflammatory immune responses during
plasmodial infection crucial importance, since disruption leads severe
malaria pathology. il-22 member il-10 cytokine family, known
to highly important immune regulation. could detect high plasma levels
of il-22 plasmodium falciparum malaria well plasmodium berghei anka
(pba)-infected c57bl/6j mice. deficiency il-22 mice pba
infection led earlier occurrence cerebral malaria associated with
a lower parasitemia compared wt mice. furthermore, early time point of
infection cells pba-infected il22(-/-) mice showed enhanced ifnγ 
diminished il-17 production. moreover, dendritic cells il22(-/-) mice
expressed higher amount costimulatory ligand cd86 upon infection. this
finding corroborated vitro since bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
from il22(-/-) mice better inducers antigen-specific ifnγ response by
cd8(+) cells. even though il-22 receptor complex known on
hematopoietic cells, data suggest link il-22 adaptive
immune system currently identified.
