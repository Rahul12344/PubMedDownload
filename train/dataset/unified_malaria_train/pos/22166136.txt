background: plasmodium falciparum infection leads alterations b cell subset
distribution. infancy, development peripheral b cell subsets also
occurring. however, unknown infants living malaria endemic region have
alterations b cell subsets independent age effect.
methods: evaluate impact exposure p. falciparum b cell
development infants, flow cytometry used analyse distribution and
phenotypic characteristic b cell subsets infant cohorts prospectively
followed 12, 18 24 months two geographically proximate regions in
western kenya divergent malaria exposure i.e. kisumu (malaria-endemic, n =
24) nandi (unstable malaria transmission, n = 21).
results: significantly higher frequency absolute cell numbers of
cd19+ b cells kisumu relative nandi 12(p = 0.0440), 18(p = 0.0210) and
24 months (p = 0.0493). differences observed infants the
two sites frequencies na√Øve b cells (igd+cd27-) classical memory b cells
(igd-cd27+). however, immature transitional b cells (cd19+cd10+cd34-) higher
in kisumu relative nandi three ages. contrast, levels of
non-class switched memory b cells (cd19+igd+cd27+) significantly lower
overall kisumu relative nandi significantly 12 (p = 0.0144), 18 (p = 
0.0013) 24 months (p = 0.0129).
conclusions: data suggest infants living malaria endemic regions
have altered b cell subset distribution. studies needed understand
the functional significance changes long-term impact ability of
these infants develop antibody responses p. falciparum heterologous
infections.
