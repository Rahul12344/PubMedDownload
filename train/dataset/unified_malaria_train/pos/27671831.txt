background: malaria elicits inflammatory responses, which, well regulated,
may exert detrimental effects. activated, triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 1 (trem-1) enhances inflammatory responses increasing secretion 
of il-8 th1 cytokines. contrast, trem-like transcript 1 (treml-1)
promotes anti-inflammatory responses binding trem-1 ligands competing
with trem-1, thus antagonizing trem-1 activation reduce inflammation.
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) also mediates anti-inflammatory responses
by activating endothelial protein c (pc). upon microbial stimulation, soluble
forms trem-1 (strem-1) soluble epcr (sepcr) released. plasma
levels reflect degree inflammation severity infection.
methods: cross-sectional study comparing patients severe with
uncomplicated malaria, strem-1, soluble treml-1 (streml-1) sepcr plasma
levels well plasma levels sepcr derived convalescent patients 
quantified. samples collected admittance paediatric patients infected 
with plasmodium falciparum hospitals accra, ghana. distinct genetic regions
of genes encoding trem-1, epcr, interleukin (il)-8 il-18 encompassing
known genetic polymorphisms influence plasma levels underwent dna
sequencing.
results: higher strem-1 levels observed among children suffering severe
malaria compared uncomplicated malaria (p = 0.049). low trem-1 to
treml-1 ratios associated uncomplicated malaria (p = 0.033). trem1 
rs2234237t variant causing amino acid exchange thr25ser, been
associated higher trem-1 plasma levels, significantly frequent
among patients severe malaria uncomplicated malaria (p = 
0.036). low levels sepcr observed severe uncomplicated malaria,
while variant genotypes il8, il18 epcr show association.
conclusion: higher plasma levels strem-1 alone relative streml-1 
malaria predispose phenotype severe malaria. carriage trem1
rs2234237t allele appears risk factor development severe
malaria.
