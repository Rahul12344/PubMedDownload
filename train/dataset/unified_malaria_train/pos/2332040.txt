plasmodium yoelii infection albino mice decreased activity brain
glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) 30 48% crude homogenate its
synaptosomal fraction, respectively. decrease evident 20%
parasitemia remained less constant 80% parasitemia. km
values gad normal infected animals 1.2 x 10(-2) 3.3 x 10(-2)
mm, respectively, indicating decrease enzyme substrate affinity due to
infection. lowered gad activity rose slightly normal treatment of
infected animals chloroquine. decrease gad activity reflected lower
gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) levels infected brain; however,
gaba-transaminase activity significantly influenced infection. 
been proposed impaired gaba synthesis may due hypoxia induced by
malarial infection.
