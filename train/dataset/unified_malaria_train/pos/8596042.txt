in study, demonstrate glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) major 
toxin plasmodium falciparum origin responsible nitric oxide (no)
production host cells. purified malarial gpi sufficient induce no
release time- dose-dependent manner macrophages vascular
endothelial cells, regulates inducible synthase expression macrophages.
gpi-induced production blocked synthase-specific inhibitor
l-n-monomethylarginine. gpi also synergizes ifn-gamma regulating no
production. structurally related molecules dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol
and im4 glycoinositolphospholipid leishmania mexicana activity, 
and latter antagonized ifn-gamma-induced output. gpi activates macrophages
by initiating early onset tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling process, similar 
to induced total parasite extracts. tyrosine kinase antagonists
tyrphostin genistein inhibited release parasite extracts 
gpi, alone combination ifn-gamma, demonstrating involvement one
or tyrosine kinases signaling cascade. gpi-induced release was
also blocked protein kinase c inhibitor calphostin c, demonstrating role
for protein kinase c gpi-mediated cell signaling, pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate, indicating involvement nf-kappa b/c-rel family of
transcription factors cell activation. neutralizing mab malarial gpi
inhibited production induced gpi total malarial parasite extracts in
human vascular endothelial cells murine macrophages, indicating gpi a
necessary agent parasite origin parasite-induced output. thus, in
contrast dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol glycoinositolphospholipids of
leishmania, malarial gpi initiates protein tyrosine kinase- protein kinase 
c-mediated signal transduction pathway, regulating inducible synthase
expression participation nf-kappa b/c-rel, leads macrophage 
and vascular endothelial cell activation downstream production no. these
events may play role etiology severe malaria.
