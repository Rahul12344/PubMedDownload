cerebral malaria (cm) associated high mortality rate, long-term
neurocognitive impairment approximately one third survivors. adjunctive
therapies modify pathophysiological processes involved cm may improve
outcome anti-malarial therapy alone. pparγ agonists reported to
have immunomodulatory effects variety disease models. report that
adjunctive therapy pparγ agonists improved survival long-term
neurocognitive outcomes plasmodium berghei anka experimental model cm. 
compared anti-malarial therapy alone, pparγ adjunctive therapy administered to
mice onset cm signs, associated reduced endothelial
activation, enhanced expression anti-oxidant enzymes sod-1 and
catalase neurotrophic factors brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf)
and nerve growth factor (ngf) brains infected mice. two months
following infection, mice treated anti-malarials alone
demonstrated cognitive dysfunction, mice received pparγ adjunctive
therapy completely protected neurocognitive impairment from
pba-infection induced brain atrophy. humans p. falciparum malaria, pparγ 
therapy associated reduced endothelial activation induction
