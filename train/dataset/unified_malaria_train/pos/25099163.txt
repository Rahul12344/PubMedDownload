the development endemic burkitt's lymphoma (ebl) closely associated with
epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection holoendemic malaria infections. role
of ebv development malignancy studied depth, is
still little known mechanisms malaria affects burkitt's
lymphomagenesis. activation induced cytidine deaminase (aid) expression is
necessary introduction c-myc translocations characteristic of
bl, link aid ebv malaria unclear. determine whether
frequency malaria exposure leads increased aid expression peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) examined two cohorts children western
kenya endemic sporadic malaria transmission dynamics. high frequency 
malaria exposure led increased expression aid, coincided with
decreases igm(+) memory b cells. children malaria endemic 
region, presence detectible ebv viral load associated higher
aid expression compared children undetectable ebv, effect was
not seen children sporadic exposure malaria. study demonstrates
that intensity malaria transmission correlates aid expression levels in
the presence ebv suggesting malaria ebv infection synergistic 
effect development c-myc translocations bl.
