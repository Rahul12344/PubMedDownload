plasmodium falciparum infection generally induces elevated total plasma levels of
immunoglobulins, recognize self- parasite-specific antigens. 
our knowledge, first report high levels functional
immunoglobulin e (ige) autoantibodies recognizing brain 14-3-3 protein ε in
asymptomatic p. falciparum malaria. 14-3-3 ε protein belongs family of
proteins binds cd81, member tetraspanin superfamily elicited 
hepatocyte invasion sporozoites. levels expression 14-3-3 ε protein were
found increased vivo vitro plasmodium yoelii p.
falciparum intrahepatic development. collectively, results indicate that
self-reactive ige produced malaria. addition, negative
correlation levels self-reactive ige 14-3-3 ε protein and
parasitemia asymptomatic malaria due p. falciparum supports role for
these ige molecules defense mechanisms, probably interfering with
development liver-stage parasites cd81 pathway.
