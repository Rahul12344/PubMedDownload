the present study carried determine prevalence theileria
annulata large ruminants southern punjab (pakistan). blood samples were
collected 144 large ruminants, consisting 105 cattle 39 buffaloes,
from six districts southern punjab including multan, layyah, muzaffar garh,
bhakar, bahawalnagar, vehari. data characteristics animals 
herds collected questionnaires. age animals (p = 0.02),
presence ticks animals (p = 0.02), presence ticks dogs associated
with herds (p = 0.05) among major risk factors involved spread of
tropical theileriosis study area. two different parasite detection
techniques, pcr amplification screening giemsa-stained slides, were
compared, found pcr amplification sensitive tool (19%
parasite detection) compared smear scanning (3% parasite detection) the
detection t. annulata. twenty eight 144 animals produced 721-bp
fragment specific t. annulata five six sampling districts.
different blood (hemoglobin, glucose) serum (alt, ast, ldh, cholesterol)
parameters calves cattle measured compared between
parasite-positive parasite-negative samples assess effect t.
