clones vitro-cultured babesia bigemina-infected erythrocytes were
concentrated several density gradient procedures. density range of
infected erythrocytes containing pairs parasites 1.077 1.089 g/ml,
whereas density range infected erythrocytes containing single parasites
was 1.092 1.100 g/ml. three enzymes--lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-phosphate 
isomerase, glutamate dehydrogenase--were found associated infected
erythrocytes. parasite-specific enzyme and/or isoenzymes shown have
different mobility patterns starch gel electrophoresis found the
normal bovine erythrocytes. enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase not
detected parasite-specific enzyme b. bigemina-infected erythrocytes.
