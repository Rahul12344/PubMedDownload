background: theileria annulata blood parasite affecting ruminants. hemolytic
anemia, secondary hypoxia, vasculitis important features of
tropical theileriosis.
objectives: evaluation electrocardiographic findings changes in
cardiovascular biochemical markers including ctni concentrations cattle
naturally infected theileriosis absence acute cardiac failure.
animals: ninety adult holstein cattle (>1 year) clinical laboratory
evidence theileriosis 30 healthy cattle served controls.
methods: case-control study blood samples collected randomized 
after clinical, hematologic, parasitologic examination laboratory
confirmation electrocardiographic recording animals, serum cardiac
troponin (ctni), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), creatine kinase-mb
(ck-mb) evaluated.
results: serum concentration ctni significantly higher cattle with
theileriosis (mean: 0.028 ng/ml; range: 0.005-0.21 ng/ml; control mean: 0.011;
range: <0.005-0.09 ng/ml; p = .003). significant correlation between
serum level ctni pcv (r = -0.257; p < .001) also ctni and
parasitemia (r = 0.515; p < .001). mean serum activities ast ck-mb were
107 ± 46 301 ± 103 u/l sick animals, significantly higher 
healthy cattle (p = .002 p = .041, respectively). pathologic
arrhythmias detected sick animals.
conclusions clinical importance: theileriosis risk factor elevation 
of cardiac biomarkers naturally infected holstein cattle. severity anemia
and parasitemia might contribute pathophysiology myocardial damage. the
prognostic significance increased serum cardiac troponin concentrations in
cattle hemolytic anemia merits investigation.
