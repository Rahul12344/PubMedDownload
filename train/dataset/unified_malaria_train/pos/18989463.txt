plasmodium sporozoites, causative agent malaria, injected their
vertebrate host bite infected anopheles mosquito, homing the
liver invade hepatocytes proliferate develop merozoites
that, upon reaching bloodstream, give rise clinical phase of
infection. investigate host cell signal transduction pathways affect
hepatocyte infection, used rnai systematically test entire kinome and
associated genes human huh7 hepatoma cells potential roles during
infection p. berghei sporozoites. three-phase screen covered 727 genes,
which tested total 2,307 individual sirnas using automated
microscopy assay quantify infection rates qrt-pcr assess silencing
levels. five protein kinases thereby emerged top hits, caused
significant reductions infection silenced rnai. follow-up validation
experiments one hits, pkcsigma (pkczeta), confirmed physiological
relevance findings reproducing inhibitory effect p. berghei
infection adult mice treated systemically liposome-formulated
pkcsigma-targeting sirnas. additional cell-based analyses using a
pseudo-substrate inhibitor pkcsigma added rnai-independent support,
indicating role host pkcsigma invasion hepatocytes by
sporozoites. study represents first comprehensive, functional
genomics-driven identification novel host factors involved plasmodium
sporozoite infection.
