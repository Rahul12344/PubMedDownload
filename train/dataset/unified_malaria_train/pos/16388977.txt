to understand mechanism sequestration microvasculature patients 
with falciparum malaria, examined patterns expression mrnas for
adhesion molecules (icam-1, vcam-1, e-selectin) tight junction molecules 
(occludin, vinculin, zo-1) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs)
co-cultured plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (prbcs) in
vitro. prbcs collected patients uncomplicated, severe, or
cerebral malaria (cm). patterns mrna expression huvecs co-cultured with
prbcs examined real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr). levels mrnas three adhesion molecules
increased increased culture time within 3 h, regardless source the
prbcs. contrast, patterns mrna expression tight junction
molecules varied different co-cultures. huvecs cultured
with prbcs uncomplicated malaria patients, levels mrnas tight
junction molecules increased according culture time. huvecs co-cultured
with prbcs severe malaria patients showed change mrnas levels
during 3 h observation. huvecs cultured prbcs cm patients,
levels mrnas tight junction proteins decreased according culture
time. although mechanisms underlying phenomena clear, our
results suggest prbcs alter expression tight junction proteins in
endothelial cells site sequestration thereby influence disease
severity.
