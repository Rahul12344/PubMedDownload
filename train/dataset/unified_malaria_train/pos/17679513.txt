intraerythrocytic piroplasms, morphologically indistinguishable cytauxzoon
felis, identified stained blood films one third of
free-ranging cougars (puma concolor couguar) southern florida study 
failed demonstrate negative effects piroplasm infection measured
hematologic parameters. however, recent study nested 18s rrna polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) assay identified 9% free-ranging cougars in
southern florida infected c. felis found 83% animals were
infected unnamed small babesia sp. study, hematology clinical
chemistry parameters determined initial appearance piroplasms 
in stained blood films three western cougars housed northern florida. one
animal became ill, remaining two animals exhibit clinical signs
of disease. hematocrit decreased three cougars concomitant the
first recognized parasitemia. regenerative response anemia (increased
polychromasia, increased mean cell volume, increased red cell distribution
width) recognized two cougars examined twice the
following 2 weeks. thrombocytopenia probable leukopenia occurred one
animal. consistent clinical chemistry findings increased serum
bilirubin concentrations increased alanine aminotransferase aspartate
aminotransferase activities time initial recognition parasitemia.
serum protein findings consistent cougars. use pcr and
determination 18s rrna gene sequences blood three animals
revealed infection c. felis, babesia sp. report, we
demonstrate mild hemolytic anemia, probably liver injury, occurs
concomitant initial discovery c. felis piroplasms stained blood
films.
