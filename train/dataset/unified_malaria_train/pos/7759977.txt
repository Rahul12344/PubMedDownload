transcobalamin ii (tcii) levels reported elevated patients
with many clinical conditions including proliferative reticuloendothelial system.
as reactive macrophage hyperplasia frequently occurs patients malaria,
the objective present study determine tcii patients with
plasmodium falciparum cerebral symptoms. studies performed 14
cerebral malaria patients well 60 normal subjects. mean values serum
vitamin b12 tcii levels significantly higher patient group 6 
and 7 patients serum vitamin b12 tcii levels higher normal
values. direct relationship serum tcii levels bun or
creatinine levels. findings indicated raised serum tcii level occurred
only patients renal insufficiency. decreased glomerular filtration rate
reduced amount vitamin b12 tcii-b12 filtered the
glomeruli resulting reduced proximal tubular cells uptake its
degradation tcii. reduced lysosomal enzyme activity, therefore, prolongs 
the intravascular tcii survival increased secretion tcii the
circulation. therefore, serum tcii levels elevated cerebral malaria
patients.
