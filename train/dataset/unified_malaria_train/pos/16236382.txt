neuronal calpains appear activated uncontrollably sustained elevation of
cytosolic calcium levels pathological conditions well as
neurodegenerative diseases. present study, characterized calpain
activation cytosolic extract mice cerebral cortex cerebellum using an
experimental model fatal murine cerebral malaria (fmcm). pathology fmcm
resulted increase activity calpains cerebral cortex and
cerebellum. western blot analysis revealed increase levels of
mu-calpain (calpain-1) cytosolic fraction infected cerebral cortex 
cerebellum although decrease level m-calpain observed the
cytosolic fraction infected cerebellum cerebral cortex. calpain activation
was confirmed monitoring formation calpain-specific spectrin
breakdown products (sbdp). protease-specific sbdp revealed formation of
calpain-generated 150kda product infected cerebral cortex cerebellum. 
the specific signature fragment calpain activation spectrin breakdown
after plasmodium berghei anka infection provide strong evidence role 
calpains cell death cerebral cortex cerebellum. given role 
of calpains neurodegeneration cell death, results strongly suggest
that calpains important mediators cell injury neurological sequelae
associated fmcm.
