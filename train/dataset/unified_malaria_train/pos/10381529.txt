lactoferrin (lf), human serum protein, strongly inhibited adherence of
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (pe) immobilized chondroitin
sulfate (csa)-conjugated albumin concentration 100 microg/ml and
blocked pe binding cd36-expressing chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells, as
well immobilized cd36 concentrations 5 microg/ml 100 microg/ml,
respectively. biotinylated lf bound cd36 saturable manner, such
binding inhibited unlabeled lf anti-cd36 monoclonal antibody, 8a6,
suggesting specificity binding. additionally, lf inhibited pe binding to
immobilized thrombospondin (tsp) concentration 100 microg/ml, and
specific binding lf tsp confirmed using biotinylated lf. lf inhibited
pe binding c32 amelanotic melanoma cells dose-dependent manner. peptide
of lf, arg-asn-met arg-lys-val arg-gly-pro-pro-val-ser-cys (amino acid residues
25-37 lf), suggested contribute lf binding various
materials, including csa, inhibited pe binding immobilized csa-conjugated
albumin, immobilized cd36, cd36-expressing cho cells, immobilized tsp, c32
amelanotic melanoma cells, well lf itself. results suggest lf
peptide may provide basis developing agents able inhibit
csa-, cd36-, tsp-mediated cytoadherence pe.
