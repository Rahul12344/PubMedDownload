host inflammatory responses plasmodium falciparum gpi (pfgpi) anchors are
believed play important role pathophysiology severe malaria.
however, relatively little known signal transduction pathways
involved pfgpi-stimulated inflammatory response potential contribution
to severe malaria syndromes. study, investigated role mapk
activation pfgpi-induced cytokine secretion examined role selected 
mapks model cerebral malaria vivo. demonstrate erk1/2, jnk,
p38, c-jun, activating transcription factor-2 became phosphorylated in
pfgpi-stimulated macrophages. jnk inhibitor (1,9-pyrazoloanthrone) inhibited
pfgpi-induced phosphorylation jnk, c-jun, activating transcription
factor-2 significantly decreased pfgpi-induced tnf-alpha secretion.
pfgpi-stimulated jnk c-jun phosphorylation absent jnk2(-/-)
macrophages unchanged jnk1(-/-) jnk3(-/-) macrophages compared with
wild-type macrophages. jnk2(-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less
tnf-alpha response pfgpi macrophages jnk1(-/-), jnk3(-/-), and
wild-type counterparts. furthermore, demonstrate role jnk2 mediating 
inflammatory responses severe malaria vivo. contrast wild-type or
jnk1(-/-) mice, jnk2(-/-) mice lower levels tnf-alpha vivo and
exhibited significantly higher survival rates challenged plasmodium
berghei anka. results provide direct evidence pfgpi induces tnf-alpha 
secretion activation mapk pathways, including jnk2. results
suggest jnk2 potential target therapeutic interventions severe
malaria.
