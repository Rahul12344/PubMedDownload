dendritic cells (dcs) sentinels immune system uniquely prime
naive cells initiate adaptive immune responses. cd1c (bdca-1) myeloid dcs
(cd1c(+) mdcs) highly express hla-dr, broad toll-like receptor (tlr)
repertoire, secrete immune modulatory cytokines. better understand immune 
responses malaria, cd1c(+) mdc maturation cytokine production were
examined healthy volunteers experimental intravenous
plasmodium falciparum infection 150- 1,800-parasite-infected red blood
cells (prbcs). either dose, cd1c(+) mdcs significantly reduced hla-dr
expression prepatent infections. circulating cd1c(+) mdcs upregulate
hla-dr prbc tlr ligand stimulation exhibited reduced cd86
expression. peak parasitemia, cd1c(+) mdcs produced significantly tumor
necrosis factor (tnf), whereas interleukin-12 (il-12) production unchanged.
interestingly, 1,800-prbc dose caused reduction circulating
cd1c(+) mdc count evidence apoptosis. 1,800-prbc dose produced no
change cell ifn-γ il-2 production peak parasitemia 3 weeks
posttreatment. overall, cd1c(+) mdcs compromised p. falciparum exposure,
with impaired hla-dr cd86 expression, increased capacity tnf 
but il-12 production. first prepatent p. falciparum infection sufficient
to modulate cd1c(+) mdc responsiveness, likely contributing hampered effector 
t cell cytokine responses assisting parasite immune evasion.
