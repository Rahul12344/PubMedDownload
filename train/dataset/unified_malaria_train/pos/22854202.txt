theileria parva (t. parva) causes east coast fever (ecf), huge
economic importance eastern southern african countries. previous
bovine model, inflammatory cytokines closely associated disease
progression animals experimentally infected t. parva. african cape
buffalo (syncerus caffer), natural reservoir t. parva, completely
resistant ecf despite persistently high parasitaemia following infection
with t. parva. characterizing basic immunological interactions host is
critical understanding mechanism underlying disease resistance the
african cape buffalo. study, expression level several cytokines
was analyzed t. parva-infected buffaloes. significant
differences expression profiles inflammatory cytokines the
infected uninfected animals despite remarkably high parasitaemia the
former. however, expression level il-10 significantly upregulated in
the infected animals. results indicate correlation diminished
inflammatory cytokines response disease resistance buffalo.
