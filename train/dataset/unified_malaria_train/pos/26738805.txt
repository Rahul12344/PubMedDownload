background: factors leading poor outcomes malaria infection are
incompletely understood. common genetic variation exists human genes for
toll like receptors (tlrs) alter host responses pathogen-associated
molecular patterns. genetic variation tlr1 tlr6 could alter risk of
development complicated malaria ability host control the
parasite burden acute plasmodium falciparum infection.
methods: five single nucleotide polymorphisms tlr1 tlr6 432 patients
with clinical p. falciparum monoinfection acquired thai-myanmar border
were genotyped. using logistic regression, associations development of
complicated malaria percentage infected erythrocytes (parasitaemia) on
the day presentation clinical care (day zero) tested.
results: genotypes carrying (major) allele tlr1 rs5743551--an allele
associated improved outcomes sepsis--were associated higher
parasitaemia measured day zero (p = 0.03).
discussion: since malaria exerts strong genetic pressure human genome,
protection parasitaemia associated tlr1 rs5743551 may account the
maintenance allele associated poor outcomes caucasians sepsis.
conclusion: data suggest genetic variation tlr1 effects 
host response plasmodium falciparum malaria asian populations. genotypes
from tlr6 showed evidence association either complicated malaria or
parasite burden.
