we identify n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea (enu)-induced i23n mutation themis
protein causes protection experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) caused
by infection plasmodium berghei anka. themis(i23n) homozygous mice show
reduced cd4(+) cd8(+) lymphocyte numbers. ecm resistance p. berghei
anka-infected themis(i23n) mice associated decreased cerebral cellular
infiltration, retention blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced
proinflammatory cytokine production. themis(i23n) protein expression absent
from mutant mice, concurrent decreased themis(i23n) stability observed
in vitro. biochemical studies vitro functional complementation vivo 
themis(i23n/+):lck(-/+) doubly heterozygous mice demonstrate functional
coupling themis lck tyrosine kinase required ecm pathogenesis.
damping proinflammatory responses themis(i23n) mice causes susceptibility
to pulmonary tuberculosis. thus, themis required development and
ultimately function proinflammatory cells. themis(i23n) mice used
to study newly discovered association themis (6p22.33) inflammatory
bowel disease multiple sclerosis.
