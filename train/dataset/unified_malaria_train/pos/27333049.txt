plasmodium falciparum malaria deadly pathogen. invasion red blood
cells (rbcs) merozoites target vaccine development. although
anti-merozoite antibodies block invasion vitro, efficacy in
vivo. explain discrepancy hypothesized complement activation
could enhance rbc invasion binding complement receptor 1 (cr1). we
show monoclonal antibody directed merozoite human
polyclonal igg merozoite vaccine recipients enhanced rbc invasion a
complement-dependent manner soluble cr1 inhibited enhancement.
sialic acid-independent strains, presumably able bind cr1 via a
native ligand, showed less complement-dependent enhancement rbc invasion 
sialic acid-dependent strains utilize native cr1 ligands. confocal
fluorescent microscopy revealed complement-dependent invasion resulted in
aggregation cr1 rbc surface contact merozoite. finally,
total anti-p. berghei igg enhanced parasite growth c3 deficiency decreased
parasite growth mice. results demonstrate, contrary current views,
that complement activation conjunction antibodies paradoxically aid
parasites invade rbcs considered future design testing of
merozoite vaccines.
