this study aimed determine changes lymphocyte surface markers and
cytokine profiles malarial infection mouse model malaria.
mononuclear cells obtained spleens mice infected plasmodium 
berghei (p. berghei) stained anti-mouse cd3, anti-mouse cd4, anti-mouse
cd8, anti-mouse cd19, anti-mouse cd152, anti-mouse pan natural killer (nk),
anti-mouse cd80 monoclonal antibodies expression surface markers was
evaluated flow cytometry. serum samples mice, levels of
tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interferon gamma (ifn-gamma),
transforming growth factor-1beta (tgf-1beta), interleukin (il)-4, il-10, 
il-12 cytokines determined elisa method. expressions the
surface markers lymphocyte evaluated statistically significantly lower in
the infected mice healthy control mice (p < 0.05). however, except
for level tgf-1beta, levels cytokines evaluated 
statistically significantly higher infected group control
group (p < 0.001). significant differences determined the
tgf-1beta levels study control groups (p > 0.05). study, t, b,
and nk lymphocyte responses inhibited cytokine profiles changed the
course malarial infection. thus, interventions increase th1 lymphocyte 
response may beneficial prevention malarial infection.
