interferon regulatory factor 8 (irf8) required development, maturation and
expression anti-microbial defenses myeloid cells. bxh2 mice harbor a
severely hypomorphic allele irf8 (irf8(r294c)) causes susceptibility to
infection intracellular pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis. we
report bxh2 completely resistant development cerebral malaria 
(ecm) following plasmodium berghei anka infection. comparative transcriptional
profiling brain rna well chromatin immunoprecipitation and
high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) used identify irf8-regulated genes
whose expression associated pathological acute neuroinflammation. genes
increased infection strongly enriched irf8 binding sites, suggesting 
that irf8 acts transcriptional activator inflammatory programs. these
lists enriched myeloid-specific pathways, including interferon
responses, antigen presentation th1 polarizing cytokines. show that
inactivation several downstream target genes (including irf8
transcription partner irf1) confers protection ecm. ecm-resistance in
irf8 irf1 mutants associated impaired myeloid lymphoid cells
function, including production il12p40 ifnÎ³. note strong overlap
between genes bound regulated irf8 ecm genes regulated the
lungs m. tuberculosis infected mice. irf8-dependent network contains
several genes recently identified risk factors acute chronic human
inflammatory conditions. report common core irf8-bound genes forming a
critical inflammatory host-response network.
