background: impact pathophysiology plasmodium falciparum placental
malaria (pm) profile oxidative stress biomarkers their
relationship poor pregnancy outcomes women remain unknown.
methods: 2013 2014, peripheral blood placenta tissue 120
cameroonian women delivery assessed maternal haemoglobin and,
parasitaemia respectively. parasite accumulation placenta investigated
histologically. levels oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (mda), 
nitric oxide (no), superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) gluthatione
(gsh) supernatant teased placenta tissues determined by
colorimetric enzymatic assays.
results: parasitaemia inversely related haemoglobin levels birth
weight (p <0.001 0.012, respectively). level lipid peroxide product
(mda) significantly higher malaria infected (p = 0.0047) anaemic
(p = 0.024) women compared non-infected non-anaemic counterparts,
respectively. similar trend observed sod levels, though not
significant. levels mda also correlated positively parasitaemia (p = 
0.0024) negatively haemoglobin levels (p = 0.002). no
association parasitaemia, haemoglobin level oxidative
stress biomarkers. histological studies, levels mda associated positively
and significantly placenta malaria infection presence malaria
pigments. levels sod, cat increased decreasing leukocyte
accumulation intervillous space. baby birth weight increased significantly
with sod cat levels, decreased levels gsh.
conclusions: placental p. falciparum infection may cause oxidative stress 
placenta tissue mda potential biomarker pm, alongside gsh
could lead poor pregnancy outcomes (anaemia low birth weight). this
finding contributes understanding pathophysiology p. falciparum 
placental malaria women.
