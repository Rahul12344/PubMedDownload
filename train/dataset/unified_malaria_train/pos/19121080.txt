antibodies b cells critical protective immune response the
blood stage malaria parasite, plasmodium chabaudi. however, little is
known development memory b cells differentiation into
plasma cells infection re-infection. shown b
cells phenotypic characteristics memory cells (cd19(+)igd(-) cd38(+),
igg1(+)) generated primary plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi infection of
mice. addition, observed germinal centre cells (cd19(+), gl7(+),
mhcii(hi)) marginal zone b cells (cd19(+)cd23(-)igd(-)) show faster expansion
on re-infection primary, though subsets not. interestingly, 
though igm(-) igm(+) memory cells produced, igm(+) memory cells do
not expand second infection. second infection quickly produced mature bone
marrow plasma cells (intracellular ig(hi), cd138(hi), cd9(+), b220(-)), compared 
to primary infection; generates large population immature splenic
plasma cells (b220+). analysis suggests memory b cell population is
generated single infection malaria, re-infection responds
quickly producing germinal centres generating long-lived plasma cells making 
the second encounter parasite efficient.
