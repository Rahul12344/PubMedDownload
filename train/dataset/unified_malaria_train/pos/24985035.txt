the digestive vacuole (dv) plasmodium falciparum, released the
bloodstream upon rupture parasitized red blood cell (rbc), recently
discovered activate alternative complement pathway. present work,
we show c3- c5-convertases assembling parasitic organelle are
able provoke deposition activated c3 c5b-9 non-infected bystander
erythrocytes. direct contact dvs cells mandatory effect, and
bystander complement deposition occurs focally, possibly sites contact.
complement opsonization promotes protracted erythrophagocytosis human
macrophages, effect magnified ring-stage infected rbcs with
reduced cd55 cd59, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh)-rbcs lacking 
these complement inhibitors employed targets. bystander attack also
directly induce lysis pnh-rbcs. direct evidence complement activation 
bystander attack mediated dvs obtained immunohistochemical
analyses brain paraffin sections autopsies patients died of
cerebral malaria. c3d assembled c5b-9 complex could detected all
sections, colocalizing often extending locally beyond massive
accumulations dvs identified polarized light. the
first demonstration complement-activating particle mediate
opsonization bystander cells promote antibody-independent
phagocytosis. phenomenon may act concert pathomechanisms to
promote development anemia patients severe malaria.
