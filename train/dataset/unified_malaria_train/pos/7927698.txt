to investigate pathogenic versus protective role cytokines and
toxin-binding factors plasmodium falciparum infections, measured the
concentrations tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha), 
il-1 beta, il-1 receptor antagonist, il-6, well soluble receptors of
tumor necrosis factor il-6 (sil-6r) serum gambian children with
cerebral malaria, mild asymptomatic malaria, illnesses unrelated to
malaria. cytokine secretion may triggered toxic structures
containing phosphatidylinositol (pi), also measured concentrations anti-pi 
antibodies pi-binding serum protein beta-2-glycoprotein i. found
increased concentrations il-6, sil-6r, il-1ra, immunoglobulin m
antibodies pi children cerebral malaria, died had
decreased concentrations beta-2-glycoprotein i. conclude increased
concentrations cytokines soluble cytokine receptors represent normal
host response p. falciparum infections excessive secretion of
cytokines like il-6 may predispose cerebral malaria fatal outcome 
beta-2-glycoprotein may protect fatal outcome cerebral malaria.
