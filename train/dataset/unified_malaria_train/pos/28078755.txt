sumoylation reversible post translational modification proteins that
regulates protein stabilization, nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein-protein
interactions. several viruses bacteria modulate host sumoylation machinery
for efficient infection. plasmodium sporozoites infective forms malaria
parasite invade mammalian hepatocytes transforms exoerythrocytic
forms (eefs). here, show eef development, distribution of
sumoylated proteins host cell nuclei significantly reduced expression 
of sumoylation enzymes downregulated. plasmodium eefs destabilized the
host cytoplasmic protein smad4 inhibiting sumoylation. sumo1
overexpression detrimental eef growth, insufficiency only
conjugating enzyme ubc9/e2 promoted eef growth. expression genes involved 
in suppression host cell defense pathways infection reversed during
sumo1 overexpression, revealed transcriptomic analysis. inhibition of
host cell sumoylation also observed toxoplasma infection. provide a
hitherto unknown mechanism regulating host gene expression apicomplexan
parasites altering host sumoylation.
