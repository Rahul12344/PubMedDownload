accumulating evidence indicates platelets play critical role the
pathogenesis experimental severe malaria (esm) elicited infection with
plasmodium berghei. mice injected day 1 p berghei infection (early) with
either anti-cd41 anti-cd61 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) exhibited
significantly (p<.001) increased survival esm compared infection
controls, indicating platelets function early disease. contrast,
groups mice treated days 4, 5, 6 (late) anti-cd41 mab exhibited
similar mortality controls. platelet depletion anti-cd41 mab day
4 infection protect mice, platelet adherence occurs day 6,
platelet adherence endothelium required mediate malarial
pathogenesis. platelet microparticles detected blood the
course malaria, large numbers erythrocyte vesicles, microparticles, and
debris detected. protective effect early anti-cd41 mab treatment 
independent number platelets, platelet microparticles,
erythrocyte-platelet conjugates, erythrocyte vesicles. mice treated early
with anti-cd41 mab exhibited markedly altered cytokine production day 4 p
berghei infection (increased interleukin 10 [il-10], il-1alpha, il-6,
interferon-gamma [ifn-gamma], tumor necrosis factor alpha [tnf-alpha];
decreased il-2) decline coagulation factors compared rat
immunoglobulin g (igg)-treated controls, indicating platelets regulate the
levels pathogenic cytokines.
