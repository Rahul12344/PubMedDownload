in article, confirm positive association acid phosphatase locus 1 
(acp1)*a/adenosine deaminase locus 1 (ada1)*2 gametic type type 1 diabetes
(t1d) previously reported show negative correlation frequency
of gametic type past malarial morbidity sardinia. one hundred seven 
adult women t1d 385 healthy adult women caucasian population of
central italy studied. data 1384 children central area of
sardinia also reexamined. t1d subjects show highly significant
increase acp1*a/ada1*2 gametic type compared healthy subjects the
same population (p = 0.003). frequency acp1*a/ada1*2 gametic type is
decreasing increasing past malarial morbidity. ada1*2 allele
decreases activity *a allele since low acp1 activity decreases
zeta-chain-associated protein kinase molecular weight 70 kda (zap70)
activity resulting weak t-cell receptor signalling epistatic interaction
involving ada1, acp1 zap70 seems likely mechanism associations
observed.
