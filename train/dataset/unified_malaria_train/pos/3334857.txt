in blood stages malaria parasite, plasmodium, displays high lipid
metabolism. present evidence abundant long-chain acyl-coa synthetase
(ec 6.2.1.3) activity plasmodium knowlesi-infected simian erythrocytes. the
activity found 20-fold higher schizont-infected (the last
parasite stage) control erythrocytes. cosubstrate requirements the
enzyme similar previously reported acyl-coa synthetases from
other sources. among separated reaction products oleyl-coa synthetase,
only ppi oleyl-coa inhibitory, ki 350 microm. fatty acid
specificity parasite acyl-coa synthetase activity fairly marked and
depended unsaturation state substrate. tested fatty acids
displayed similar vmax, whereas km ranged 11 (palmitate) 59 microm 
(arachidonate). finally, experiments involving heat inactivation separation
on hydroxyapatite excluded presence specific arachidonyl-coa synthetase 
identical present cells. hand, fatty acid
competition experiments evidenced existence least two distinct
enzymatic sites fatty acid activation p. knowlesi-infected simian
erythrocytes: one specific saturated fatty acids for
polyunsaturated species, whereas oleate could activated sites.
