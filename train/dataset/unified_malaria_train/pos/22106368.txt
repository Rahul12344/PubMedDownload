the adhesion infected red blood cells (irbcs) microvascular endothelium 
critical pathogenesis severe malaria. used atomic force and
confocal microscopy examine adhesive forces irbcs human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells. initial contact cells generated mean ± 
sd adhesion force 167 ± 208 pn formation single multiple bonds 
with cd36. strength adhesion increased 5- 6-fold within minutes of
contact signaling pathway initiated cd36 ligation live irbcs, 
polystyrene beads coated anti-cd36 ppmc-179, recombinant peptide
representing minimal binding domain parasite ligand pfemp1 cd36.
engagement cd36 led localized phosphorylation src family kinases the
adaptor protein p130cas, resulting actin recruitment cd36 clustering by
50-60% adherent beads. uninfected red blood cells igg-coated beads no
effect. inhibition increase adhesive strength src family kinase 
inhibitor pp1 gene silencing p130cas decreased adhesion 39 ± 12 48 ±
20%, respectively, 10 dyn/cm(2) flow chamber assay. modulation of
adhesive strength pfemp1-cd36-actin cytoskeleton synapses could novel
target antiadhesive therapy.
