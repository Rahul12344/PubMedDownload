release soluble granzymes (sgranzymes) considered reflect activation 
cytotoxic lymphocytes nk cells. sgranzymes number pro-inflammatory
cytokines measured plasma malaria patients natural or
experimentally induced plasmodium falciparum infections. concentrations of
sgranzyme b, il-10, il-12p70 crp significantly increased in
african children presenting clinical malaria; il-10 crp concentrations
were significantly correlated disease severity. nonimmune dutch
volunteers experimentally infected p. falciparum-infected
mosquitoes, sgranzyme increment started 1-2 days prior clinical symptoms and
microscopically detectable parasitaemia. coincided increases in
ifngamma, il-12p40 il-8, sgranzyme b il-10 levels increased 24-48 h
later. elevation sgranzyme ifngamma nonimmune volunteers suggests
that nk cells activated upon release parasites infected liver cells and
subsequently blood stage infection; thus, nk cells likely involved
innate immune human host resistance early phase malaria infection.
