plasmodium falciparum malaria infection associated early marked
increase plasma von willebrand factor (vwf) levels, together a
pathological accumulation hyperreactive ultra-large vwf (ul-vwf) multimers.
given established critical role platelets malaria pathogenesis, these
increases plasma vwf raise intriguing possibility vwf may play a
direct role modulating malaria pathogenesis. address hypothesis, we
used established murine model experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), which
wild-type (wt) c57bl/6j mice infected plasmodium berghei anka. in
keeping findings children p falciparum malaria, acute endothelial
cell activation early consistent feature murine model of
cerebral malaria (cm), resulting significantly increased plasma vwf levels.
despite fact murine plasma adamts13 levels significantly
reduced, pathological ul-vwf multimers also observed murine plasma
following p berghei infection. determine whether vwf plays role in
modulating pathogenesis cm vivo, investigated p berghei
infection vwf(-/-) c57bl/6j mice. clinical ecm progression delayed, and
overall survival significantly prolonged vwf(-/-) mice compared wt
controls. despite protection ecm, significant differences in
platelet counts blood parasitemia levels observed vwf(-/-) wt
mice. interestingly, however, degree ecm-associated enhanced blood-brain
barrier permeability significantly attenuated vwf(-/-) mice compared 
wt controls. given significant morbidity mortality associated cm,
these novel data may direct translational significance.
