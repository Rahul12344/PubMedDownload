high levels free heme found pathological states increased hemolysis,
such sickle cell disease, malaria, ischemia reperfusion. hemolytic
events often associated inflammatory response usually turns into
chronic inflammation. recently reported heme proinflammatory
molecule, able induce neutrophil migration, reactive oxygen species
generation, il-8 expression. study, show heme (1-50 microm)
delays human neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis vitro. effect requires heme
oxygenase activity, depends reactive oxygen species production de
novo protein synthesis. inhibition erk pi3k pathways abolished
heme-protective effects upon human neutrophils, suggesting involvement the
ras/raf/mapk pi3k pathway effect. confirming involvement these
pathways modulation antiapoptotic effect, heme induces akt
phosphorylation erk-2 nuclear translocation neutrophils. futhermore,
inhibition nf-kappa b translocation reversed heme antiapoptotic effect.
nf-kappa b (p65 subunit) nuclear translocation kappa b degradation were
also observed heme-treated cells, indicating free heme may regulate
neutrophil life span modulating signaling pathways involved cell survival. our
data suggest free heme associated hemolytic episodes might play an
important role development chronic inflammation interfering the
longevity neutrophils.
