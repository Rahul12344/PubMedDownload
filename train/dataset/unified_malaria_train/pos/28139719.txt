cells leading pathological inflammation blood-brain barrier alterations.
il-22 contributes chronic inflammatory infectious diseases, may
have protective pathogenic effects, depending tissue disease state.
we evaluated whether polymorphisms (n = 46) il22 il22ra2 associated
with cm children nigeria mali. two snps il22, rs1012356
(p = 0.016, or = 2.12) rs2227476 (p = 0.007, or = 2.08) independently
associated cm sample 115 nigerian children cm 160 controls.
the association rs2227476 (p = 0.01) replicated 240 nuclear families 
with one affected child mali. snp rs2227473, linkage disequilibrium 
rs2227476, also associated cm combined cohort two
populations, (p = 0.004, or = 1.55). snp rs2227473 located within putative
binding site aryl hydrocarbon receptor, master regulator il-22
production. individuals carrying aggravating allele rs2227473 produced
significantly il-22 without allele. overall, findings 
suggest il-22 involved pathogenesis cm.
