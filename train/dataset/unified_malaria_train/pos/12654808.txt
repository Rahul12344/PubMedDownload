plasmodium berghei-infected mice, well-recognized model experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm), exhibit many hallmarks systemic inflammatory 
response, organ damage brain, lung, kidneys. identification the
molecules mediating pathogenesis inflammatory response, leukocyte 
adhesion, may lead new therapies. indeed, mice lacking cell adhesion
molecule p-selectin significantly (p = 0.005) protected death due p.
berghei malaria compared c57bl/6 controls despite similar parasitemia (p =
0.6) found groups mice. p-selectin levels assessed the
quantitative dual radiolabeled monoclonal antibody technique increased
significantly (p < 0.05) several organs c57bl/6 mice infected p.

malarial pathogenesis. intravital microscopic analysis brain
microvasculature demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) leukocyte rolling and
adhesion brain venules p. berghei-infected mice compared found
in uninfected controls. maximum leukocyte adhesion occurred day 6 p.
berghei infection, mice become moribund exhibit marked vascular
leakage brain, lung, heart. however, p-selectin levels were
significantly (p < 0.005) increased brain, lung, kidneys p. berghei
malaria ecm-resistant balb/c mice compared found uninfected
balb/c controls, indicating increased p-selectin alone sufficient 
mediate malarial pathogenesis. leukocyte adhesion brain microvessels of
p-selectin-deficient mice p. berghei malaria similar observed in
control mice. collectively, results indicate p-selectin important
for development malarial pathogenesis required leukocyte
