the role b7/cd28 costimulatory pathway polyclonal specific
lymphocyte activation induced blood stages plasmodium chabaudi was
investigated cd28 gene knockout (cd28(-/-)) c57bl/6 (cd28(+/+)) mice.
analysis spleen acute infection revealed similar increase 
t b cell populations groups mice. moreover, cd28(-/-) mice were
able develop polyclonal igm response p. chabaudi. contrary, the
polyclonal igg2a response markedly reduced absence cd28. production
of ifn-gamma; up-regulation cd69, cd40l, cd95 (fas), cd95l (fas ligand);
and induction apoptosis also affected lack cd28. interestingly,
the ability control first parasitemia peak compromised acutely 
infected cd28(-/-) mice, cd28(-/-) mice failed eradicate parasites
that persisted blood >3 mo infection. addition, drug-cured
cd28(-/-) mice unable generate memory cells, develop anamnesic igg
response, eliminate parasites secondary challenge. incapacity
of cd28(-/-) mice acquire full protective immunity p. chabaudi correlated
with impaired production specific igg2a. moreover, reinfected cd28(-/-)
mice protected adoptive transfer serum reinfected cd28(+/+)
mice containing specific igg2a. results demonstrate polyclonal
lymphocyte response partially affected absence cd28, this
coreceptor essential generate specific b cell responses required 
complete protection p. chabaudi malaria.
