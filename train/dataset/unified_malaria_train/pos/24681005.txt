background: various factors determine outcome plasmodium falciparum
infection parasite load, sequestration, adhesion molecules, immune
mediators. p. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) msp-2 genotypes 
were also found associated severe disease. investigated association
between msp-1 msp-2 genotypes patients uncomplicated malaria (um) and
severe malaria (sm).
methods: twenty-two malaria patients microscopy-confirmed p. falciparum
infection eight healthy endemic controls selected analysis. nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used identify p. falciparum genotypes. the
plasma concentration cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α),
interleukin-6 (il-6), interferon-gamma (ifn-γ)] chemokines [chemokine
(c-x-c motif) ligand 9 (cxcl9) cxcl10] evaluated using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results: tnf-α levels significantly higher um (389 pg/ml, p = 0.020)
and sm (771 pg/ml, p = 0.004) compared healthy controls, were
greater sm (p = 0.012) compared um. cxcl9 levels significantly
raised sm compared um negative controls (ncs). cxcl10 levels were
raised um (550 pg/ml, p = 0.001) sm (1480 pg/ml, p = 0.01) compared
with ncs. increased levels il-6 found patients carrying fc27
allelic type msp-2. higher prevalence mad 20 k1 msp-1 alleles was
observed sm group compared um.
conclusion: overall, greater prevalence mad 20 alleles increased serum
tnf-α cxcl9 levels associated severe outcome malaria.
understanding diversity malaria genotypes important predicting
disease-related outcomes p. falciparum infection endemic areas.
