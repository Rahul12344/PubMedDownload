malaria infection induces oxidative stress host cells. antioxidant enzymes
such glutathione s-transferases (gsts) responsible fighting reactive
oxygen species reduction oxidative stress. common gst polymorphisms have
been associated susceptibility different diseases whose pathologies
involve oxidative stress. study, tested hypothesis gst
polymorphisms lead reduced lack enzyme activity associated with
severe plasmodium falciparum malarial anemia. studied genotypic
distribution gstm1, gstt1, gstp1 polymorphisms mild malaria (n =
107) severe malarial anemia (n = 50) tanzanian children. find a
significant relationship gstt1 polymorphism. gstm1-null higher in
the severe malaria anemia group difference significant (p =
0.08). however, significant association gstp1 i105v genotype severe
malarial anemia discovered (26.0% 10.3% mild malaria, p = 0.004). 
concluded gstp1 possibly gstm1 may protect severe falciparum
malaria children.
