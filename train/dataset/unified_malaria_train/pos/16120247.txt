babesia annae piroplasms recently recognised cause infection
and disease among dogs europe. pathogenesis clinical implications of
this emerging disease remain poorly understood. conducted study to
describe electrophoretic profiles associated infection to
determine b. annae associated azotaemia caused renal failure. we
examined microscopy 2,979 canine blood samples submitted diagnostic
laboratory nw spain september 2001 april 2002. small ring-shaped
piroplasms detected blood smears 87 samples identity 58 
these presumptive cases confirmed pcr. group 58 infected dogs and
a reference group 15 healthy non-infected dogs study population. 
all dogs, serum protein response -albumin, alpha-1 globulin, alpha-2
globulin, beta globulin gamma globulin- measured capillary
electrophoresis. response infected non-infected dogs compared 
within infected dogs, response azotaemia (19) compared with
that non-azotaemic dogs (39). infected dogs presented significant elevation 
of total proteins different globulin fractions, significantly
lower levels albumin compared non-infected dogs. among infected dogs, those
presenting azotaemia significantly lower concentrations total proteins,
albumin, beta gamma globulins, significantly higher values alpha-2
globulin. specific gravity threshold 1,025 dogs with
azotaemia urine sample available (7) suggesting azotaemia,
in dogs renal origin. azotaemic dogs higher concentrations of
cholesterol triglycerides, probably result liver compensatory
response loss proteins. conclude serum protein response b.
annae infected dogs corresponds pattern haemolytic syndrome with
intense inflammatory reaction azotaemia associated infection 
is likely renal origin.
