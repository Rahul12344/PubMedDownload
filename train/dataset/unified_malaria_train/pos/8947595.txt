an vitro model system developed freshly isolated resting
wc1+ gamma/delta tcr+ cells proliferate response cells transformed the
protozoan parasite theileria annulata, providing strategy basis of
activation naive gamma/delta cells investigated. irradiated
parasite-transformed cells stimulate proliferation, cytolytic
activity, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) non-immune
animals. proliferating cells mainly wc1+ gamma/delta cells. the
majority wc1+ gamma/delta cells freshly isolated pbmc express cd25 a
low level increases stimulated t. annulata-infected cells.
purified wc1+ gamma/delta cells fail proliferate cultured with
irradiated t. annulata-infected cells produce small proliferative response 
to il-2, proliferate strongly irradiated lightly fixed
theileria-infected cells combination il-2. theileria-infected cells
express cytokine transcripts encoding il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6 il-10, 
not ifn gamma, il-2, il-4 il-7. purified wc1+ gamma/delta cells stimulated 
with t. annulata-infected cells without il-2 fail produce il-2
transcripts, produce tnf alpha. experiments show wc1+
gamma/delta cells recognize surface determinant t. annulata-infected
cells, together second signal, provided exogenous
il-2, stimulates proliferation.
