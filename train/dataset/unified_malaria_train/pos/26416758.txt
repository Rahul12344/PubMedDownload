enhancing repair myelin important still elusive therapeutic goal 
many neurological disorders. multiple sclerosis, inflammatory demyelinating
disease, endogenous remyelination occur frequently insufficient to
restore function. parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and
endogenous adult neural stem cells resident within subventricular zone are
known sources remyelinating cells. characterize contribution to
remyelination subset adult neural stem cells, identified their
expression gli1, transcriptional effector sonic hedgehog pathway. 
show cells recruited subventricular zone populate
demyelinated lesions forebrain never enter healthy, white matter
tracts. unexpectedly, recruitment pool neural stem cells, their
differentiation oligodendrocytes, significantly enhanced genetic or
pharmacological inhibition gli1. importantly, complete inhibition canonical
hedgehog signalling ineffective, indicating role gli1 in
augmenting hedgehog signalling retarding myelination specialized.
indeed, inhibition gli1 improves functional outcome a
relapsing/remitting model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is
neuroprotective. thus, endogenous neural stem cells mobilized the
repair demyelinated lesions inhibiting gli1, identifying new therapeutic 
avenue treatment demyelinating disorders.
