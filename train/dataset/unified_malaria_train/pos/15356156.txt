acute chronic plasmodium falciparum malaria accompanied severe
immunodepression possibly related subversion dendritic cells (dc)

monocyte functions related immunity. hemozoin-loaded monocytes, frequently
found circulation adherent endothelia malaria, may interfere dc
development play role immunodepression. hemozoin-loaded unloaded
human monocytes differentiated vitro immature dc (idc) treatment
