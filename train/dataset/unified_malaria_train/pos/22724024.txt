malarial pigment (natural haemozoin, hz) ferriprotoporphyrin ix crystal
produced plasmodium parasites haemoglobin catabolism. hz-fed human
monocytes functionally compromised, releasing increased amounts of
pro-inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines cytokine-related 
proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9), whose role complicated 
malaria recently suggested. previous work hz shown induce
through tnfalpha production release monocytic lysozyme, enzyme stored
in gelatinase granules mmp-9. here, underlying mechanisms were
investigated. results showed hz lipid moiety promoted early late
lysozyme release. hz-dependent lysozyme induction abrogated by
anti-tnfalpha/il-1 beta/mip-1 alpha blocking antibodies mimicked by
recombinant cytokines. moreover, hz early activated either p38 mapk nf-kappab 
pathways inducing: p38 mapk phosphorylation; cytosolic i-kappab alpha
phosphorylation degradation; nf-kappab nuclear translocation dna-binding.
inhibition routes selected molecules (sb203580, quercetin,
artemisinin, parthenolide) prevented hz-dependent lysozyme release. data
suggest hz-triggered overproduction tnfalpha, il-1 beta mip-1 alpha
mediates induction lysozyme release human monocytes activation of
p38 mapk nf-kappab pathways, providing new evidence mechanisms underlying 
the hz-enhanced monocyte degranulation falciparum malaria potential
role lysozyme new affordable marker severe malaria.
