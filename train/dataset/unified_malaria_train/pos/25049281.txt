endothelial cell protein c receptor (epcr) first identified isolated a
cellular receptor protein c endothelial cells. epcr plays crucial role
in protein c anticoagulant pathway promoting protein c activation. 
last decade, epcr received wide attention discovered play a
key role mediating activated protein c (apc)-induced cytoprotective effects,
including antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, barrier stabilization. apc
elicits cytoprotective signaling activation protease activated
receptor-1 (par1). understanding epcr-apc induces cytoprotective effects
through activation par1, whose activation thrombin known induce a
proinflammatory response, become major research focus field. recent 
studies also discovered additional ligands epcr, include factor viia,
plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein, specific variant the
t-cell receptor. observations open unsuspected new roles epcr in
hemostasis, malaria pathogenesis, innate immunity, cancer. future research on
these new discoveries undoubtedly expand understanding role of
epcr normal physiology disease, well provide novel insights into
mechanisms epcr multifunctionality. comprehensive understanding epcr may
lead development novel therapeutic modalities treating hemophilia,
inflammation, cerebral malaria, cancer.
