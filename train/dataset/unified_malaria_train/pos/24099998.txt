blood coagulation activation frequently found patients malaria.
clinically apparent bleeding disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) is
associated severe disease high mortality. protein c, protein s,
and antithrombin levels found low p. falciparum, normal in
p. vivax infection. plasma levels plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 high 
in cases p. falciparum infection whereas tissue plasminogen activator levels
were low. elevated plasma levels von willebrand factor (vwf) vwf
propeptide, thrombomodulin, endothelial microparticles reported p.
falciparum-infected patients. demonstrated severe p. falciparum 
infection associated acute endothelial cell (ec) activation, abnormal
circulating ultralarge vwf multimers, significant reduction plasma
adamts13 function. changes may result intravascular platelet
aggregation, thrombocytopenia, microvascular disease. also shown 
that p. falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (prbcs) induce tissue factor (tf) 
expression microvascular ecs vitro. recently, loss endothelial protein c
receptor (epcr) localized sites cytoadherent prbcs cerebral malaria 
been demonstrated. severe malaria associated parasite binding epcr.
the cornerstone treatment coagulopathy malaria use of
effective anti-malarial agents. dic spontaneous systemic bleeding 
treated screened blood products. study thailand shown for
patients presented parasitemia >30% severe systemic complications
such acute renal failure ards, survival superior group who
received exchange transfusion. use heparin generally restricted to
patients dic extensive deposition fibrin, occurs purpura
fulminans acral ischemia. antiplatelet agents interfere protective
effect platelets malaria avoided.
