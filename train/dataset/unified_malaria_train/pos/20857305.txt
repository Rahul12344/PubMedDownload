increased cytosolic ca(2+) concentrations activate gardos k(+) channels human 
erythrocytes membrane hyperpolarization, efflux k(+), cl⁻, and
osmotically obliged h₂o resulting cell shrinkage, phenomenon referred 
gardos effect. tested whether gardos effect delays colloid osmotic
hemolysis injured erythrocytes mice lacking ca(2+)-activated k(+)
channel k(ca)3.1. end, applied patch clamp flow cytometry and
determined vitro well vivo hemolysis. result, erythrocytes 
k(ca)3.1-deficient (k(ca)3.1(-/-)) mice lacked gardos channel activity the
gardos effect. blood parameters, reticulocyte count, osmotic erythrocyte
resistance, however, differ k(ca)3.1(-/-) mice their
wild-type littermates, suggesting low absent gardos channel activity in
unstressed erythrocytes. oxidative stress-induced ca(2+) entry phospholipid
scrambling significantly less pronounced k(ca)3.1(-/-) wild-type 
erythrocytes. moreover, vitro treatment α-toxin staphylococcus
aureus, forms pores cellular membrane, resulted significantly
stronger hemolysis k(ca)3.1(-/-) wild-type erythrocytes. intravenous
injection α-toxin induced profound hemolysis k(ca)3.1(-/-) in
wild-type mice. similarly, intra-peritoneal application redox-active
substance phenylhydrazine, agent induction hemolytic anemia, was
followed significantly stronger decrease hematocrit k(ca)3.1(-/-) than
in wild-type mice. finally, malaria infection triggered activation of
k(ca)3.1 transient shrinkage infected erythrocytes. conclusion,
k(ca)3.1 channel activity gardos effect counteract hemolysis injured
erythrocytes, thus decreasing hemoglobin release circulating blood.
