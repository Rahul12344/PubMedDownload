no overproduction suggested contribute immunopathology related
to malaria infection. even though role parasite molecules (e.g., gpi) 
in induction proposed, direct contribution hemozoin (hz),
another parasite metabolite, remains established. therefore, were
interested determine whether plasmodium falciparum (pf) hz synthetic hz,
beta-hematin, alone combination ifn-gamma, able induce
macrophage (mphi) synthesis. observed neither pf hz synthetic hz
led generation b10r murine mphi; however, significantly increased
ifn-gamma-mediated inducible synthase (inos) mrna protein expression, 
no production. next, investigating transductional mechanisms involved in
this cellular regulation, established hz induces extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation
as well nf-kappab binding inos promoter, enhances the
ifn-gamma-dependent activation second messengers. interest, cell
pretreatment specific inhibitors either nf-kappab erk1/2
pathway blocked hz + ifn-gamma-inducible nf-kappab activity significantly
reduced hz-dependent increase ifn-gamma-mediated inos induction.
even though selective inhibition janus kinase 2/stat1alpha pathway
suppressed synthesis response hz + ifn-gamma, hz alone activate 
this signaling pathway up-regulating effect the
ifn-gamma-induced janus kinase 2/stat1alpha phosphorylation stat1alpha
binding inos promoter. conclusion, results suggest hz exerts a
potent synergistic effect ifn-gamma-inducible generation mphi via
erk- nf-kappab-dependent pathways.
