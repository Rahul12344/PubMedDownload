background: previous studies association -131r/h
polymorphism fc-gamma receptor iia (fcγriia) gene malaria
susceptibility yielded conflicting results. aim meta-analysis
was clarify accurately association polymorphism malaria 
risk.
methods: systematic literature search associated studies august 1,
2013, conducted using following electronic databases: pubmed, embase,
medline, china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki). statistical
analyses performed stata12.0 software, odds ratios (ors) their
95% confidence intervals (cis).
results: six eligible studies including 4111 malaria cases 2817 controls were
identified. pooled analysis studies pointed significant
association variant h allele reduced susceptibility malaria or
possible protection malaria: h vs. r (or=0.691, por=0.009); hh vs. rr
(or=0.523, por=0.013); rh vs. rr (or=0.770, por=0.037); rh+hh vs. rr (or=0.664,
por=0.019); hh vs. rh+rr (or=0.649, por=0.037). subgroup analysis, similar
significant associations also found asia (hh vs. rr: or=0.137, por=0.009;
hh vs. rh+rr: or=0.267, por=0.000) africa (rh vs. rr: or=0.842, por=0.002;
rh+hh vs. rr: or=0.859, por=0.004).
conclusions: meta-analysis suggests variant h allele the
fcγriia-131r/h polymorphism may protective factor blood-stages of
malaria infection, asians africans. finding may aid the
development effective immune protection strategies malaria focus 
on antibody responses enrich current knowledge gene polymorphism the
malaria. large well-designed studies needed confirm this
association.
