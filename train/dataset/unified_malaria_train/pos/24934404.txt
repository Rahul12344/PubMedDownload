background: plasmodium falciparum malaria one widespread and
deadliest infectious diseases children five years endemic areas. 
disease strong force evolutionary selection human genome,
and uncovering critical host genetic factors confer resistance the
disease would provide clues molecular basis protective immunity and
improve vaccine development initiatives.
methods: effect single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) plasma
transforming growth factor beta (tgf-β) interleukin 10 (il-10) levels on
malaria pathology investigated case-control study 1862 individuals
from two major ethnic groups three regions intense perennial p.
falciparum transmission cameroon. thirty-four malaria candidate polymorphisms,
including sickle cell trait (hbs), assayed sequenom iplex
platform plasma tgf-β il-10 levels measured sandwich elisa.
results: study confirms known protective effect hbs severe
malaria also reveals protective effect snps nitrogen oxide
synthase 2 (nos2) gene malaria infection, anaemia uncomplicated
malaria. furthermore, adcy9 rs10775349 (additive g) abo rs8176746 ac
individuals associated protection hyperpyrexia and
hyperparasitaemia, respectively. meanwhile, individuals emr1 rs373533
gt, emr1 rs461645 ct rtn3 rs542998 (additive c) genotypes more
susceptible hyperpyrexia females males rs1050828 and
rs1050829 snps g6pd, respectively, vulnerable anaemia. plasma
tgf-β levels strongly correlated heterozygosity adcy9 rs2230739
and hbb rs334 snps individuals abo rs8176746 ac genotype lower
il-10 levels.
conclusion: taken together, study suggests rare polymorphisms in
candidate genes may important implications susceptibility of
cameroonians severe malaria. moreover using uncomplicated malaria
phenotype may permit identification novel pathways early
development disease.
