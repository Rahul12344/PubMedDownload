antigen-presenting cells (apcs) key players induction regulation
of immune responses. plasmodium falciparum malaria, determination which
cells pathways activated network apcs remains elusive. we
therefore investigated effects controlled human malaria infection in
healthy, malaria-naive volunteers subset composition activation status
of dendritic cells (dcs) monocytes. subsets monocytes increased in
frequency blood-stage infection, dc frequencies remained largely stable.
activation markers classically associated peptide presentation and
priming αβt cells, hla-dr cd86, upregulated monocytes and
inflammatory cd16 myeloid dcs (mdcs) classical cd1c, bdca2, or
bdca3 dc subsets. addition, activated apc subsets showed increased
expression cd1c, involved glycolipid antigen presentation, 
the immune complex binding fcγ receptor iii (cd16). data show p.
falciparum asexual parasites activate classical dc subsets instead
activate mainly monocytes inflammatory cd16 mdcs appear prime
alternative activation pathways via induction cd16 and/or cd1c. changes in
expression surface molecules might increase antigen capture enhance 
glycolipid antigen presentation addition classical major
histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc-ii) peptide presentation thereby
contribute initiation t-cell responses malaria. (this study been
