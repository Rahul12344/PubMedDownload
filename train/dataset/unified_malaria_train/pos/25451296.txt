cognitive dysfunction major sign cerebral malaria (cm). however, the
underlying mechanisms cm cognitive outcome remain poorly understood. body of
evidence suggests adult neurogenesis may play role learning memory 
processes. also reported phenomena regulated the
immune system. hypothesized memory dysfunction cm results from
hippocampal neurogenesis impairment mediated deregulated immune response
during acute phase cm. c57bl/6 mice infected plasmodium berghei 
anka (pba) strain, using standardized inoculation 10(6) parasitized
erythrocytes. long-term working memory evaluated using novel object
recognition test. mrna expression brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(bdnf), tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (trk-b) nerve growth factor (ngf) 
frontal cortex hippocampus estimated real-time polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). protein levels cytokine interleukin-2 (il-2), il-4, il-6, 
il-10, interferon-γ (ifn-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), ccl11 and
neurotrophins bdnf ngf determined using cytometric bead array (cba)
kit enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cell viability hippocampus was
analyzed confocal microscopy. neurogenesis dentate gyrus determined
through quantification doublecortin (dcx) positive cells. pba-infected mice
presented working memory impairment day 5 post-infection. time
point, cm mice exhibited decrease dcx-positive cells dentate gyrus in
parallel increased cell death elevated inflammatory cytokines (il-6,
tnf-α, ifn-γ ccl11) hippocampus frontal cortex. significant
reduction bdnf mrna expression also found. il-6 tnf-α correlated
negatively bdnf ngf levels hippocampus cm mice. summary, we
provide evidence neuroinflammation following pba-infection
influences neurotrophin expression, impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and
increases hippocampal cell death association memory impairment following 
cm course. current study identified potential mediators memory impairment 
in cm.
