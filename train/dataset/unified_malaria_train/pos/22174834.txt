background: propensity sequester placental intervillous 
space, plasmodium falciparum evade detection peripheral smear women
with placental malaria (pm). evaluated host biomarkers potential indicators
of occult pm infections.
methods findings: using case-control design, evaluated ability of
biomarkers identify pm absence circulating peripheral parasites (n =
24) compared placental smear-negative controls (n = 326). measured levels
of biomarkers (c3a, c5a, crp, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, stie-2, sendoglin, 
vegf, sflt-1, tissue factor, leptin) maternal peripheral plasma at
delivery. using roc curve analysis, assessed ability clinical
parameters biomarkers accurately detect pm infections identified by
placental smear. show decreases sflt-1 leptin increases crp
were associated occult pm infections (p<0.01) correlated placental 
parasitaemia (p<0.01). individually, markers moderate ability diagnose
occult pm infections areas roc 0.62 0.72. order 
improve diagnostic performance, generated simple scoring systems identify
pm infections using either clinical score (0-2), biomarker score (0-3) a
clinical plus biomarker score (0-5). combinatorial model incorporated
both clinical parameters biomarkers area curve (auc) 0.85
(95% ci, 0.81-0.89), significantly better identifying occult pm
infections clinical score alone (p = 0.001).
conclusion: data suggest host biomarkers maternal peripheral
blood may improve detection pm absence peripheral parasitaemia.
