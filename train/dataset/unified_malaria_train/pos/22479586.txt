background: mortality severe malaria [cerebral malaria (cm), severe
malaria anemia (sma), acute lung injury (ali) acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ards)] remains high despite availability associated adequate
treatments. recent studies laboratory others revealed hitherto 
unknown correlation chemokine cxcl10/cxcr3, heme/ho-1 stat3 and
cerebral malaria severity mortality. although heme/ho-1 cxcl10/cxcr3
interactions directly involved pathogenesis cm fatal disease,
the mechanism dictating heme/ho-1 cxcl10/cxcr3 expressed and
regulated conditions still unknown. therefore tested the
hypothesis factors share common signaling pathways may mutually
regulated.
methods: first clarified roles heme/ho-1, cxcl10/cxcr3 stat3 cm 
pathogenesis utilizing well established experimental cerebral malaria mouse
(ecm, p. berghei anka) model. then, determined mechanisms how
stat3 regulates ho-1 cxcl10 well mutual regulation among in
crl-2581, murine endothelial cell line.
results: results demonstrate (1) stat3 activated p. berghei anka
(pba) infection vivo heme vitro. (2) heme up-regulates ho-1 cxcl10 
production stat3 pathway, regulates cxcl10 transcriptional
level vitro. (3) ho-1 transcription positively regulated cxcl10. (4)
ho-1 regulates stat3 signaling.
conclusion: data indicate heme/ho-1, cxcl10/cxcr3 stat3 molecules as
well related signaling pathways play important roles pathogenesis 
of severe malaria. conclude factors mutually regulated and
provide new opportunities develop potential novel therapeutic targets that
could used supplement traditional prophylactics treatments malaria 
and improve clinical outcomes reducing malaria mortality. ultimate goal
is develop novel therapies targeting heme cxcl10-related biological
signaling molecules associated development fatal malaria.
