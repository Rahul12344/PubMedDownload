marked increases phospholipase b activity measured spleen homogenates 
and sera cd-1 mice given primary infection plasmodium yoelii. rise in
enzyme activity paralleled parasitemia splenomegaly, reaching maximum
values 14 days infection. maximum enzyme activity splenomegaly were
noted 5 days challenge mice given secondary infection indicating an
anamnesticlike response following subsequent contact infecting
parasite. observations represent new finding enzyme activity a
