background: cerebral malaria (cm) represents severe outcome plasmodium
falciparum infection. recent genetic studies correlated human genes with
severe malaria susceptibility, little data genetic variants 
increase risk developing specific malaria clinical complications.
nevertheless, susceptibility experimental cm mouse linked to
host genes including transforming growth factor beta 2 (tgfb2) heme
oxygenase-1 (hmox1). here, tested whether genes governing risk 
of progressing cm patients severe malaria syndromes.
methodology/principal findings: report clinical outcome p.
falciparum infection cohort angolan children (n = 430) correlated with
nine tgfb2 snps modify risk progression cm compared other
severe forms malaria. genetic effect explained two haplotypes
harboring cm-associated snps (pcorrec. = 0.035 0.036). addition, one
hmox1 haplotype composed five cm-associated snps increased risk of
developing cm syndrome (pcorrec. = 0.002) under-transmitted to
children uncomplicated malaria (p = 0.036). notably, hmox1-associated
haplotype conferred increased hmox1 mrna expression peripheral blood cells 
cm patients (p = 0.012).
conclusions/significance: results represent first report cm genetic 
risk factors angolan children suggest novel hypothesis genetic
variants tgfb2 hmox1 genes may contribute confer specific risk of
developing cm syndrome patients severe p. falciparum malaria. this
work may provide motivation future studies aiming replicate findings
in larger populations confirm role genes determining the
clinical course malaria.
