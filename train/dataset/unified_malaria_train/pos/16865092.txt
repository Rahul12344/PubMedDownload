background purpose: atorvastatin inhibitor enzyme
3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase used prevent coronary heart
disease. studied analgesic effect atorvastatin inflammatory
models sequential release mediators (bradykinin, (bk), tumour
necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) the
chemokine, kc/cxcl) links stimulus release directly acting
hypernociceptive mediators prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)).
experimental approach: effects orally administered atorvastatin on
inflammatory mechanical hypernociception mouse paws evaluated an
electronic pressure-meter. cytokines pge(2) measured elisa ria.
key results: treatment atorvastatin 3 days dose-dependently reduced
hypernociception induced lipopolysaccharide (lps) following antigen
challenge sensitized animals. atorvastatin pre-treatment reduced
hypernociception induced bradykinin cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-1beta and
kc), release il-1beta pge(2) paw skin, induced by
lipopolysaccharide. antinociceptive effect atorvastatin lps-induced
hypernociception prevented mevalonate co-treatment without affecting serum
cholesterol levels. hypernociception induced pge(2) inhibited by
atorvastatin, suggesting intracellular antinociceptive mechanisms for
atorvastatin. antinociceptive effect atorvastatin upon lps- or
pge(2)-induced hypernociception prevented non-selective inhibitors of
nitric oxide synthase (nos) selective inhibition inducible nos or
in mice lacking enzyme.
conclusions implications: antinociceptive effects atorvastatin depend on
inhibition cytokines prostanoid production stimulation no
production constitutive nos. study suggests statins may constitute 
novel class analgesic drugs.
