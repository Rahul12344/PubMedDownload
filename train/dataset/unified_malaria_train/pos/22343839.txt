objective: investigate relationship among angiopoietin-tie-2 system,
retinopathy, mortality children cerebral malaria.
design: case-control study retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative
children clinically defined cerebral malaria.
setting: queen elizabeth central hospital blantyre, malawi.
subjects: one hundred fifty-five children presenting severe malaria and
meeting strict definition clinical cerebral malaria (blantyre coma score â‰¤
2, plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, identifiable cause coma) 
included study.
interventions: none.
measurements main results: clinical laboratory parameters recorded
at admission funduscopic examinations performed. admission levels of
angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, soluble version cognate receptor
were measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. show angiopoietin-1
levels decreased angiopoietin-2 soluble tie-2 levels increased in
children cerebral malaria retinopathy compared did
not. angiopoietin-2 soluble tie-2 independent predictors retinopathy 
(adjusted odds ratio [95% ci], angiopoietin-2, 4.3 [1.3-14.6], p = .019; soluble 
tie-2, 9.7 [2.1-45.8], p = .004). angiopoietin-2 soluble tie-2 were
positively correlated number hemorrhages, severity retinal
whitening, extent capillary whitening observed funduscopic
examination (p < .05 adjustment multiple comparisons). angiopoietin-2
and soluble tie-2 levels elevated children cerebral malaria who
subsequently died angiopoetin-2 independent predictor death
(adjusted odds ratio: 3.9 [1.2-12.7], p = .024). combined clinical
parameters, angiopoetin-2 improved prediction mortality using logistic
regression models classification trees.
conclusions: results provide insights mechanisms endothelial
activation cerebral malaria indicate angiopoietin-tie-2 axis is
associated retinopathy mortality pediatric cerebral malaria.
