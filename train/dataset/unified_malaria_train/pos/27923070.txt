host expansion macrophages monocytes, underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. show myeloid expansion p. chabaudi infection is
dependent upon cd4+ cells cytokine macrophage colony stimulating

deletion csf1 cd4+ cells p. chabaudi infection diminished
proliferation activation certain myeloid subsets, notably lymph
node-resident cd169+ macrophages, resulted increased parasite burden and
impaired recovery infected mice. depletion cd169+ macrophages during
infection also led increased parasitemia significant host mortality,
