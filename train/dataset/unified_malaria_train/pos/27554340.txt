malaria-associated acute lung injury (ali) frequent complication severe
malaria often caused "excessive" immune responses. better
understand mechanism ali malaria infection, investigated the
roles galectin (gal)-1, 3, 8, 9 receptors gal-9 (tim-3, cd44,
cd137, pdi) malaria-induced ali. injected alpha (α)-lactose into
mice-infected plasmodium berghei anka (pbanka) block galectins found 
significantly elevated total proteins bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, higher
parasitemia tissue parasite burden, increased numbers cd68(+) alveolar
macrophages well apoptotic cells lungs blockage. additionally,
mrna levels gal-9, tim-3, cd44, cd137, pdi significantly increased in
the lungs day 5 infection, levels cd137, ifn-α, ifn-β, ifn-γ,
il-4, il-10 lungs also increased α-lactose treatment.
similarly, levels gal-9, tim-3, ifn-α, ifn-β, ifn-γ, il-10 all
significantly increased murine peritoneal macrophages co-cultured with
pbanka-infected red blood cells vitro; ifn-α ifn-β were
significantly increased α-lactose treatment. data indicate gal-9
interaction multiple receptors play important role murine
malaria-associated ali.
