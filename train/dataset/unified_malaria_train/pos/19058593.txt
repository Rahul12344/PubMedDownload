to elucidate relationship falciparum malaria-associated anemia and
serum erythropoietin (epo) levels reticulocyte response acute malaria 
infection, 87 adults aged 18-65 years presenting acute, uncomplicated
malaria examined enrollment 28 days follow-up. 87 patients
were divided 2 groups: anemia (n = 45) without (n =
42). serum samples taken admission (day 0), days 7, 21, 28,
to measure reticulocyte count, absolute reticulocyte count, reticulocyte
hemoglobin content, erythropoietin level (epo). absolute reticulocyte
counts anemic patients significantly higher without
anemia days 0, 7, 21, 28. serum epo levels anemic patients
were significantly higher non-anemic group day 0 (44.39 +/- 4.06
vs 25.91 +/- 4.86 mlu/ml, p < 0.001). inadequate epo production found in
31.03% (27/87) patients day 0, 37.93% (33/87) day 7, 43.67% (38/87) on
day 21, 39.08% (34/87) day 28. results indicate defective epo
production reticulocyte response adult patients suffering acute p.
falciparum malaria, differs pediatric patients. findings may
provide basis study choice therapeutic strategies 
treat acute p. falciparum malaria-associated anemia recombinant human epo to
correct refractory anemia due malaria.
