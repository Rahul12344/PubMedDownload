we characterized cytokine response t-cell requirements mice infected
with intraerythrocytic parasites babesia microti wa1. wa1 infections were
fatal, whereas b. microti infections resolved. measured production of
tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (il)-10, and
il-4 splenic cd4+, cd8+, gammadelta+ cells using flow cytometry. wa1
inoculation stimulated tnf-alpha production, whereas resolving b. microti
infections characterized increased il-10 il-4. role tnf-alpha 
in wa1 infections investigated inoculating tnfrp55-/- mice 
lethal dose wa1. survival rate 90% tnfrp55-/- mice indicated 
a disruption tnf-alpha pathway abrogated pathologic mechanism wa1. 
inoculation wa1 cd4-/- cd8-/- mice resulted survival rates 60% 
and 78%, respectively, whereas wa1 infection gammadelta-/- control mice
was fatal. results suggest cd8+ cells may contribute the
wa1-associated disease. babesia-infected cd4-/- mice experienced longer
duration parasitemia, indicating cd4+ cells participate parasite
elimination. studies demonstrate differences immune responses during
fatal resolving babesia infections, identify tnf-alpha an
important mediator wa1-associated pathogenesis.
