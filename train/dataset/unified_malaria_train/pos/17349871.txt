this study builds upon established genetic control antimalarial immune
responses prior association studies using family-based approach,
transmission disequilibrium testing, identify immune response genes that
influence antibody responses plasmodium falciparum infection endemic
tanzanian population. candidate polymorphisms within interleukin-1 (il-1)
gene cluster, il-10 promoter, major histocompatibility complex class ii and
iii, 5q31-q33 region, t-cell receptor beta variable region. was
a significant association il1rn alleles total ige. weak evidence 
for association present polymorphisms il10 promoter region and
both anti-p falciparum ige igg4 antibodies.
