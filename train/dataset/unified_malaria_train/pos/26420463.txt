dendritic cells (dcs) play critical roles innate adaptive immunity 
pathogenesis blood stage malaria infection. mechanisms
underlying dc homeostasis malaria infection well understood. in
this study, numbers conventional dcs (cdcs) plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs) in
the spleens lethal rodent malaria infection examined, found
to significantly reduced. concomitant up-regulation of
maturation-associated molecules, activation caspase-3 significantly
increased, suggesting induction cell death. studies using neutralizing
antibody gene-deficient mice showed type ii interferons were
critically involved activation induced cell death cdcs malaria
infection. results demonstrate dcs rapidly disappeared following
ifn-mediated dc activation, homeostasis dcs significantly
impaired malaria infection.
