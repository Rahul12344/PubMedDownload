murine cerebral malaria complex disease caused plasmodium berghei anka
infection. several cell types, including cd8(+) cells, essential effectors 
of disease. although use transgenic parasites expressing model antigens
has revealed induction cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl) specific these
model antigens, direct evidence response authentic
blood-stage parasite antigens, knowledge magnitude. studies
show dramatic primary parasite-specific ctl response, akin to
viral immunity, reaching approximately 30% splenic cd8(+) cells, many
producing interferon-γ tumor necrosis factor-α. cells express granzyme 
b markers specific responders, cytolytic, respond broad
array major histocompatibility complex (mhc) i-restricted epitopes, 5 which
are identified here. studies indicate vigorous ctl responses be
induced pathogens even largely reside red blood cells, lack
mhc processing machinery.
