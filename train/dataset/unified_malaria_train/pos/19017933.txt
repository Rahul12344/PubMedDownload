studies experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) mice identified cells
and tnf family members critical mediators pathology. study we
report role light-lymphotoxin beta receptor (ltbetar) signaling the
development ecm control parasite growth. specific blockade of
light-ltbetar, light-herpesvirus entry mediator interactions, abrogated
the accumulation parasites recruitment pathogenic cd8(+) cells
and monocytes brain infection without affecting early activation of
cd4(+) cells, cd8(+) cells, nk cells. importantly, blockade of
light-ltbetar signaling caused expansion splenic monocytes overall 
enhanced capacity remove process ag infection, well reduced
systemic cytokine levels control mice displayed severe ecm symptoms. in
summary, discovered novel pathogenic role light ltbetar ecm,
identifying tnf family receptor-ligand interaction important immune
regulator experimental malaria.
