homeostasis mammalian cell function strictly depends balancing oxygen
exposure maintain energy metabolism without producing excessive reactive
oxygen species. vivo, cells different tissues exposed wide range
of oxygen concentrations, yet vitro models almost exclusively expose
cultured cells higher, atmospheric oxygen levels. existing models of
liver-stage malaria utilize primary human hepatocytes typically exhibit low 
in vitro infection efficiencies, possibly due missing microenvironmental
support signals. one cue could influence infection capacity cultured 
human hepatocytes dissolved oxygen concentration. developed a
microscale human liver platform comprised precisely patterned primary human
hepatocytes nonparenchymal cells model liver-stage malaria, oxygen
concentrations typically higher vitro liver platform anywhere 
along hepatic sinusoid. indeed, observed liver-stage plasmodium
parasite development vivo correlates hepatic sinusoidal oxygen gradients.
therefore, hypothesized vitro liver-stage malaria infection
efficiencies might improve hypoxia. using infection micropatterned
co-cultures plasmodium berghei, plasmodium yoelii plasmodium falciparum
as model, observed ambient hypoxia resulted increased survival of
exo-erythrocytic forms (eefs) hepatocytes improved parasite development in
a subset surviving eefs, based eef size. further, effective cell
surface oxygen tensions (po2) experienced hepatocytes, predicted a
mathematical model, systematically perturbed varying culture parameters
such hepatocyte density height medium, uncovering optimal cell
surface po2 maximize number mature eefs. initial mechanistic
experiments revealed treatment primary human hepatocytes hypoxia
mimetic, cobalt(ii) chloride, well hif-1α activator,
dimethyloxalylglycine, also enhance p. berghei infection, suggesting the
effect hypoxia infection mediated part host-dependent hif-1α
mechanisms.
