successful resolution malaria infection requires induction proinflammatory 
immune responses facilitate parasite clearance; however, failure regulate
this inflammation leads immune-mediated pathology. pathways maintain 
this immunological balance malaria infection remain poorly defined. in
this study, demonstrate il-27r-deficient (wsx-1(-/-)) mice highly
susceptible plasmodium berghei nk65 infection, developing exacerbated
th1-mediated immune responses, which, despite highly efficient parasite
clearance, lead directly severe liver pathology. depletion cd4(+) t
cells---but cd8(+) cells---prevented liver pathology infected wsx-1(-/-)
mice. although wsx-1 signaling required optimal il-10 production by
cd4(+) cells, administration ril-10 failed ameliorate liver damage in
wsx-1(-/-) mice, indicating additional, il-10-independent, protective
pathways modulated il-27r signaling malaria infection. data
are first demonstrate essential role il-27r signaling regulating
effector cell function malaria infection reveal novel pathway that
might amenable manipulation drugs vaccines.
