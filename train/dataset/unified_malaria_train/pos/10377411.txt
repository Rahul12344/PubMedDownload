parasites evolved plethora strategies ensure survival. the
intracellular parasite theileria parva secures propagation spreads
through infected animal infecting transforming cells, inducing their
continuous proliferation rendering metastatic. previous work, have
shown parasite induces constitutive activation transcription
factor nf-kappab, inducing constitutive degradation cytoplasmic
inhibitors. biological significance nf-kappab activation t.
parva-infected cells, however, yet defined. cells been
transformed viruses oncogenes persist manage avoid
destruction apoptotic mechanisms activated transformation 
that contribute maintain cellular homeostasis. demonstrate that
parasite-induced nf-kappab activation plays crucial role survival t. 
parva-transformed cells conveying protection apoptotic signal
that accompanies parasite-mediated transformation. consequently, inhibition of
nf-kappab nuclear translocation expression dominant negative mutant
forms components nf-kappab activation pathway, ikappabalpha 
p65, prompt rapid apoptosis t. parva-transformed cells. findings offer
important insights parasite survival strategies demonstrate that
parasite-induced constitutive nf-kappab activation essential step in
maintaining transformed phenotype infected cells.
