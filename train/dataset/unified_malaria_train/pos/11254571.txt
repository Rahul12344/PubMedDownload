the activation innate immune responses genomic dna bacteria and
several nonvertebrate organisms represents novel mechanism pathogen
recognition. recently demonstrated cpg-dependent mitogenic activity dna
from protozoan parasite babesia bovis bovine b lymphocytes (w. c. brown, 
d. m. estes, s. e. chantler, k. a. kegerreis, c. e. suarez, infect. immun.
66:5423-5432, 1998). however, activation macrophages dna protozoan
parasites demonstrated. present study therefore conducted to
determine whether dna protozan parasites b. bovis, trypanosoma cruzi,
and t. brucei activates macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators associated 
with protective immunity. dna escherichia coli three parasites
stimulated b-lymphocyte proliferation increased macrophage production of
interleukin-12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), nitric oxide
(no). regulation il-12 production occurred level of
transcription. amounts il-12, tnf-alpha, induced e. coli and
protozoal dna strongly correlated (r2 > 0.9) frequency cg
dinucleotides genome, immunostimulation dna occurred order
e. coli > = t. cruzi > t. brucei > b. bovis. induction inflammatory
mediators e. coli, t. brucei, b. bovis dna dependent presence
of unmethylated cpg dinucleotides. however, high concentrations, e. coli and
t. cruzi dna-mediated macrophage activation inhibited following
methylation. recognition protozoal dna b lymphocytes macrophages
may provide important innate defense mechanism control parasite replication
and promote persistent infection.
