malaria major infectious disease several countries caused by
protozoa genus plasmodium. vivax malaria patients, inflammatory
processes occur, well changes cytokines blood flow. present
study analyzed cytokine modulation blood viscosity patients infected 
with plasmodium vivax (p. vivax). blood samples collected 42
non-infected individuals (control group) 37 individuals infected p.
vivax. il-2, il-4, il-6, il-10, tnfα, tgf-β il-17 cytokine concentrations
in serum assessed, blood rheological properties determined.
the analysis blood viscosity shear rates revealed blood viscosity
of infected patients significantly greater non-infected 
individuals. viscosity blood greater infected individuals
than non-infected subjects. serum individuals p. vivax
infections exhibited higher ifn-γ il-17 concentrations lower tgf-β
levels. incubation blood infected individuals il-17 il-17
associated ifn-γ reduced viscosity rates equivalent blood from
non-infected individuals. independently cytokine modulation, correlation
was found parasitemia blood viscosity infected patients.
these data suggest alterations blood viscosity relevant an
auxiliary tool clinical diagnosis disease. malaria, erythrocytes
are sensitive osmotic shock, reduction viscosity il-17 may 
be related possible immunomodulator agent infection.
