background: inflammatory cytokinemia systemic activation microvascular
endothelium central pathogenesis plasmodium falciparum malaria.
recently, 'parasite-derived' uric acid (ua) shown activate human immune
cells vitro, plasma ua levels associated inflammatory cytokine
levels disease severity malian children malaria. since ua is
associated endothelial inflammation non-malaria diseases, hypothesized
that elevated ua levels contribute endothelial pathology p. falciparum 
malaria.
methodology/principal findings: measured levels ua soluble forms of
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sicam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(svcam-1), e-selectin (se-selectin), thrombomodulin (stm), tissue factor (stf)
and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) plasma malian children
aged 0.5-17 years uncomplicated malaria (um, n = 487) non-cerebral
severe malaria (ncsm, n = 68). 69 children, measured same
factors experienced malaria episode twice were
healthy (i.e., malaria transmission season). found that
levels ua, sicam-1, svcam-1, se-selectin stm increase malaria
episode return basal levels end transmission season
(p<0.0001). plasma levels ua four endothelial biomarkers correlate
with parasite density disease severity. children um, ua levels
correlate parasite density (r = 0.092, p = 0.043), sicam-1 (r = 0.255,
p<0.0001) stm (r = 0.175, p = 0.0001) levels. adjusting parasite
density, ua levels predict stm levels.
conclusions/significance: elevated ua levels may contribute malaria
pathogenesis damaging endothelium promoting procoagulant state. the
correlation ua levels parasite densities suggests parasitized
erythrocytes one possible source excess ua. ua-induced shedding of
endothelial tm may represent novel mechanism malaria pathogenesis, 
activated thrombin induces fibrin deposition platelet aggregation in
microvessels. protocol registered clinicaltrials.gov (nct00669084).
