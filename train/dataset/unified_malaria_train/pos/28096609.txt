aim: aim determine hemato-biochemical alterations determine the
better treatment theileriosis naturally infected calves.
materials methods: total 74 holstein crossbred calves 6 months 
age, either sex included present investigation bikaner. based on
the clinical examinations laboratory results, 20 calves included for
hemato-biochemical studies (before treatment) divided two
groups (having 10 calves each).
results: clinical examination calves revealed weakness, ticks
infestations, high fever 104Â°f, pronounced swelling prescapular,
prefemoral, parotid lymph nodes, loss elasticity skin, anemia, lacrimal
discharges, pulpy cornea, tachycardia, dyspnea. highly significant 
decrease (p<0.01) hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume 
total leukocyte count, serum glucose, total protein, globulin albumin level
and highly significant increase aspartate aminotransferase alanine
aminotransferase level compared healthy control animals group ii. 
the animals group ii treated buparvaquone along single blood
transfusion shows better recovery animals group treated bupavaqone
and hematinic.
conclusions: significant changes found hemato-biochemical parameters in
theileria affected calves treatment compare healthy control calves. 
significant improvement observed hemato-biochemical parameters in
buparvaquone single blood transfusion treated calves compare another
group, concluded buparvaquone single blood transfusion is
better combination treatment theileriosis.
