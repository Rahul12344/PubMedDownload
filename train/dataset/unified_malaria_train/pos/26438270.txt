background: pro-inflammatory s100 calcium binding protein a8 (s100a8) is
elevated serum patients plasmodium falciparum malaria, its
function plasmodium vivax malaria yet clear. function was
investigated p. vivax-infected patients study.
methods: level s100a8 serum measured elisa. full amino
acids s100a8 synthesized verify functions maturation of
immature dendritic cell (idc) evaluation cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) regulatory 
t (treg) generation mature dc (mdc).
results: higher amount s100a8 detected vivax-infected patients (141.2
± 61.849 ng/ml, n = 40) compared normal control group (48.1 ± 27.384 ng/ml, 
n = 40). level s100a8 coincide anti-malarial antibody
measured indirect fluorescent antibody test (ifat) using parasite-infected red
blood cells antigen. programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) up-regulated the
surface idcs following treatment synthetic s100a8, synthetic
msp-1, ama-1 csp, compared expression seen non-treated idcs.
the addition red blood cells infected patients idcs also elevated 
surface expression cd86. however, serum levels s100a8 decreased with
increase parasitaemia. dcs matured sera containing s100a8 generated treg
cells naïve cells. ratio treg cells generated inversely
proportional concentration s100a8 sera.
conclusions: treg cells suppress activity cytotoxic cells, kill
malaria parasites; therefore, up-regulation s100a8 malaria patients may
contribute pathogen immune escape tolerance.
