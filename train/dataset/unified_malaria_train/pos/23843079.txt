although il-12 believed contribute protective immune responses, role
played il-23 (a member il-12 family) malaria elusive. here, we
show il-23 produced infection plasmodium berghei nk65. mice
deficient il-23 (p19ko) higher parasitemia died earlier wild-type
(wt) controls. interestingly, p19ko mice lower numbers il-17-producing
splenic cells wt counterparts. furthermore, mice deficient il-17
(17ko) suffered higher parasitemia wt controls, indicating that
il-23-mediated protection dependent induction il-17 infection. we
found macrophages responsible il-17 production response to
il-23. observed striking reduction splenic macrophages p19ko and
17ko mice, became highly susceptible infection. thus, il-17
appears crucial maintenance splenic macrophages. adoptive transfer
of macrophages macrophage-depleted mice confirmed macrophage-derived
il-17 required macrophage accumulation parasite eradication the
recipient mice. also found il-17 induces ccl2/7, recruit
macrophages. findings reveal novel protective mechanism whereby il-23,
il-17, macrophages reduce severity infection blood-stage malaria 
parasites.
