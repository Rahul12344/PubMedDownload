modern linkage-based approaches employing extended pedigrees becoming
powerful tools localizing complex quantitative trait loci. linkage 
mapping methods, necessary reconstruct extended pedigrees include 
living individuals, using extensive pedigree records. unfortunately, records
are always easy obtain application linkage-based approaches has
been restricted. within finite population random mating, latent
inbreeding rather non-random inbreeding consanguineous marriages is
expected occur attributable coalescence finite population.
interestingly, revealed significant random inbreeding exists
even general human populations. random inbreeding used detect the
hidden coancestry individuals particular chromosomal position and
it could also application linkage mapping methods. present a
novel method, named finite population based linkage mapping (fpl) method, to
detect linkage quantitative trait marker via random inbreeding in
a finite population without pedigree records. show estimate coancestry 
for chromosomal position individuals using multipoint bayesian
estimation. subsequently, describe fpl method detecting linkage via
interval mapping method using nonparametric test. show fpl method
does work via simulated data. random sample finite population, the
fpl method powerful standard pedigree-based linkage mapping method
with using genotypes parents sample. addition, fpl method
was demonstrated actual microsatellite genotype data 750 japanese
individuals unrelated according pedigree records map known
psoriasis susceptible locus. samples without pedigree records, was
suggested fpl method require limited number individuals, therefore
would better methods using thousands individuals.
