transformation cells intracellular parasite theileria parva is
accompanied constitutive i-kappa b degradation nf-kappa b activation, a
process essential prevent spontaneous apoptosis these
parasite-transformed cells. nf-kappa b-mediated responses regulated by
selective combinations nf-kappa b proteins homo- heterodimers by
distinct kappa b motifs. characterised nf-kappa b complexes induced t. 
parva infection tpm(803) cells. western blot, demonstrated all
members nf-kappa b/rel family proteins translocate nucleus of
infected cells. using two different kappa b oligonucleotides (kappa b-1 kappa
b-2), containing decameric consensus kappa b motif (gggactttcc), clearly
distinct patterns dna binding activities could demonstrated in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays. supershift analysis uv cross-linking
assays showed complexes binding kappa b-1 consisted p50, p65 relb 
homo and/or heterodimers. could also detect association atf-2 c-fos 
with one complexes. hiv-derived kappa b-2 oligo bound p50 and
p65. additionally, several agents known inhibit wide range nf-kappa b
activation pathways inhibitory effect activation nf-kappa b dna 
binding tpm(803) cells.
