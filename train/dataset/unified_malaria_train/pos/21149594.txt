cerebral malaria (cm) primary cause deaths caused plasmodium
falciparum young children sub-saharan africa. laboratory tests based on
early detection host biomarkers patient blood would help prognosis
and differential diagnosis cm. using plasmodium berghei anka murine model 
of experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), identified 300 putative
diagnostic biomarkers ecm circulation comparing whole-blood
transcriptional profiles resistant mice (balb/c) two susceptible
strains (c57bl/6 cba/caj). results suggest transcriptional
profile whole blood captures molecular immunological events associated
with pathogenesis disease. find ecm, erythropoiesis is
dysfunctional, thrombocytopenia evident, glycosylation cell surface
components may modified. furthermore, analysis immunity-related genes
suggests slightly distinct mechanisms immunopathogenesis may operate in
susceptible c57bl/6 cba/caj mice. furthermore, data set allowed us to
create molecular signature ecm composed subset circulatory markers. 
complement component c1q, Î²-chain, nonspecific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1,
prostate stem cell antigen, dnajc, member 15, glutathione s-transferase omega-1, 
and thymidine kinase 1 overexpressed blood symptomatic phase
of ecm, measured quantitative real-time pcr analysis. studies provide
the first host transcriptome database uniquely altered the
pathogenesis ecm blood. subset mediators ecm warrant
validation p. falciparum-infected young african children diagnostic markers
of cm.
