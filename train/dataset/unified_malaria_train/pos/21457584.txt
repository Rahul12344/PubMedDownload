background: toll-like receptors (tlrs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular
patterns activation leads induction effector genes involving 
inflammatory cytokines may contribute controlling parasite growth
and disease pathogenesis. current immunogenetic study designed analyse
the key components innate immunity, tlrs tirap (toll-interleukin-1
receptor domain-containing adaptor protein), also known mal (myd88
adaptor-like), iranian patients mild malaria.
methods: tlr-4 (d299g t399i), tlr-9 (t-1486c t-1237c) tirap
(s180l) genes assessed 640 baluchi individuals (320 plasmodium
falciparum-infected 320 non-infected, median age 28 years) from
malaria-endemic regions using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) methods.
results: common tlr-4 snps promoter snps tlr-9 distributed among p.
falciparum-infected non-infected groups (p > 0.05) showed association
of variants mild clinical manifestation. comparison tirap
s180l genotypes patients mild malaria healthy individuals 
showed frequency heterozygosity significantly higher infected 
than non-infected individuals (33.8 vs. 25.6; or, 1.479; 95% ci, 1.051-2.081; p =
0.024). result also revealed significant association tirap s180l (p <
0.05) development mild malaria, common baluchi populations,
who living malaria hypoendemic region iran african
populations (0%-6%).
conclusion: data point towards need addressing exact role of
tlrs contributing human genetic factors malaria
susceptibility/resistance/severity within different malaria settings the
world.
