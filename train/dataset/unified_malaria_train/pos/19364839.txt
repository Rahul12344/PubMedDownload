to explore hypothesis susceptibility cerebral malaria influenced
by genetic variation endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos), genotyped
three commonly defined polymorphic loci enos, glu(298)-->asp, intron 4
variable number tandem repeat region, t-786-->c, 244 patients (mean
age, 36.2 years) mild malaria 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with
severe malaria belonging ethnic group orissa, eastern indian state.
we found association glu(298)-->asp substitution (p =
0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 3.0) single
unique haplotype defined "c-b-asp" (p(corrected) = 0.0024) protection
against cerebral malaria. further, median plasma level nitrite-nitrate was
found increased individuals glu(298)-->asp substitution was
significantly higher mild malaria group (p <or= 0.0001), increase 
was significant severe malaria group (p = 0.0528). findings
suggest glu(298)-->asp substitution "c-b-asp" haplotype may
enhance enos expression production, leads protection against
cerebral malaria. findings may increase understanding the
pathogenesis malaria.
