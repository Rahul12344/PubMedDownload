background: babesia infections dogs result wide range clinical and
laboratory presentations, including coagulopathy. expression intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) von willebrand factor (vwf) dogs with
babesiosis unknown.
objectives: whether inflammation babesiosis triggers activation icam-1 
the coagulation system.
animals: twelve 10 dogs naturally occurring babesiosis 
antiparasitic treatment, respectively, compared 10 healthy dogs.
methods: prospective study, diagnosis made blood smear examination
and confirmed pcr. c-reactive protein (crp), soluble intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (sicam-1), von willebrand factor (vwf) levels measured a
canine elisa kit, fibrinogen (fib) factor viii activity levels measured 
by coagulometric methods, blood cell counts (wbc, rbc, plt) determined
with automatic analyzer.
results: compared healthy dogs, crp, sicam-1, fib concentrations 
significantly increased therapy remained high 3 days therapy
in dogs babesiosis. vwf activity significantly decreased dogs with
babesiosis treatment. fviii activity differ dogs with
babesiosis healthy dogs. wbc; rbc plt significantly lower before
treatment normalized 3 days treatment.
conclusion clinical importance: proinflammatory condition babesiosis
appears influence endothelial dysfunction hemostatic activity. although
clearly beneficial parasite, sequestered blood cells obstruct blood
flow small vessels, promote inflammatory state, could increase the
severity babesiosis.
