plasmodium falciparum malaria kills nearly million people annually. 90% of
these deaths occur children five years age sub-saharan africa. a
neutrophil mediated mechanism, antibody dependent respiratory burst (adrb),
was recently shown correlate protection clinical malaria. human
neutrophils constitutively express fc gamma receptor-fcγriia fcγriiib by
which interact immunoglobulin (ig) g (igg)-subclass antibodies.
polymorphisms exon 4 fcgr2a exon 3 fcgr3b genes encoding fcγriia and
fcγriiib respectively described alter affinities both
receptors igg. here, associations specific polymorphisms, encoding
fcγriia p.h166r fcγriiib-na1/na2/sh variants clinical malaria were
investigated longitudinal malaria cohort study. fcγriia-p.166h/r was
genotyped gene specific polymerase chain reaction followed allele specific 
restriction enzyme digestion. fcgr3b-exon 3 sequenced 585 children, aged 1
to 12 years living malaria endemic region ghana. multivariate logistic
regression analysis found association fcγriia-166h/r polymorphism 
clinical malaria. a-allele fcgr3b-c.233c>a (rs5030738) significantly
associated protection clinical malaria two three genetic
models (additive: p=0.0061; recessive: p=0.097; dominant: p=0.0076) of
inheritance. fcγriiib-sh allotype (ctgaaa) containing 233a-allele (in
bold) associated protection malaria (p=0.049). fcγriiib-na2*03 
allotype (ctgcga), variant classical fcγriiib-na2 (ctgcaa) was
associated susceptibility clinical malaria (p=0.0092). present study 
is first report association variant fcγriiib-na2 and
susceptibility clinical malaria provides justification further
functional characterization variants classical fcγriiib allotypes. this
would crucial improvement neutrophil mediated functional assays such
as adrb assay aimed assessing functionality antibodies induced by
candidate malaria vaccines.
