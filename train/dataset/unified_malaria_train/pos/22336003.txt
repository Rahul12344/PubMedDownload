background: malaria endemic areas, host genetics influence whether a
plasmodium falciparum-infected child develops uncomplicated severe malaria.
tlr2 identified receptor p. falciparum-derived
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi), polymorphisms within tlr2 gene may
affect disease pathogenesis. two common polymorphisms 5'
un-translated region (utr) tlr2, 22 base pair deletion first
unstranslated exon (δ22), gt dinucleotide repeat second intron
(gtn).
methods: polymorphisms examined ugandan case control study on
children either cerebral malaria uncomplicated malaria. serum cytokine
levels analysed elisa, according genotype disease status. vitro
tlr2 expression measured according genotype.
results: δ22 gtn polymorphisms highly frequent, δ22
heterozygosity associated protection cerebral malaria (or 0.34, 95%
confidence intervals 0.16, 0.73). vitro, heterozygosity δ22 associated
with reduced pam3cys inducible tlr2 expression human monocyte derived
macrophages. uncomplicated malaria patients, δ22 homozygosity associated
with elevated serum il-6 (p = 0.04), long gt repeat alleles associated
with elevated tnf (p = 0.007).
conclusion: reduced inducible tlr2 expression may lead attenuated
pro-inflammatory responses, potential mechanism protection cerebral
malaria present individuals heterozygous tlr2 δ22 polymorphism.
