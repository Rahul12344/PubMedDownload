objectives: adenosine deaminase (ada) contributes regulation adenosine 
concentration turn cell activation. genetic variability ada
activity may have, therefore, important role resistance malaria. indeed,
previous studies sardinia shown lower frequency ada1 *2 allele
(associated low ada activity) areas, malaria heavily endemic
compared areas malaria endemic. studied ada2
locus, another polymorphic site two alleles ada2 *1 ada2 *2 within the
ada gene.
methods: area oristano (where malaria endemic past) 51
consecutive newborns area nuoro (where malaria endemic) 
48 consecutive newborns examined. ada1 ada2 genotypes determined by
dna analysis.
results: low frequency ada1 *2 allele area malaria was
endemic confirmed. frequency ada2 *2 allele higher oristano
than nuoro resulting higher frequency ada1 *1/ada2 *2 haplotype in
oristano compared nuoro. suggests selective advantage this
haplotype malarial environment.
conclusions: ada gene shows polymorphic sites studies 
role human adaptation malaria could rewarding.
