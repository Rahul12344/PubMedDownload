metabolism third component complement (c3) igg measured rats
before infection hemosporidium agent babesia rodhaina. the
course infection, hypocomplementemia immune complex nephritis developed.
during babesial infection, animals half-life c3 fell sharply, as
did serum levels c3; catabolic rate c3 sharply increased, whereas 
synthetic rate sharply decreased. contrast, catabolic rate igg
remained unchanged. alteration metabolism c3 face of
nonparallel changes igg metabolism suggests abnormal glomerular
filtration increased vasopermeability cannot explain findings. babesial
infection rat provides useful model study acquired c3
