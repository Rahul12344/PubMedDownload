the activity levels cam kinase ii-alpha investigated cytosolic 
and membrane fraction mice cerebral cortex cerebellum using an
experimental model fatal murine cerebral malaria (fmcm). parallel,
ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent phosphorylation target substrate proteins was
studied using syntide-2 substrate. pathology fmcm resulted decreased cam
kinase-ii activity cortex cerebellum though western analysis revealed
no appreciable changes levels cam kinase-ii alpha cytosol and
membrane fractions control cerebral malaria infected brain. given the
abundant expression cam kinase-ii neuronal tissue, significance in
neurotransmitter release synthesis signal transduction apoptosis, 
decreased levels enzyme activity altered phosphorylation substrate
proteins cam kinase ii may serve important cues understanding cam
kinase signal transduction events central neurological disorders fmcm.
