the parasite plasmodium berghei imports enzyme delta-aminolevulinate
dehydratase (alad), perhaps subsequent enzymes pathway the
host red blood cell sustain heme synthesis. studied mechanism
of import. 65-kda protein p. berghei membrane specifically bound to
mouse red blood cell alad, 93-amino-acid fragment (alad-deltanc) the
host erythrocyte alad able compete full-length enzyme binding
to p. berghei membrane. alad-deltanc taken infected red blood
cell added culture p. falciparum led substantial
decrease alad protein enzyme activity and, subsequently, heme synthesis in
the parasite, resulting death.
