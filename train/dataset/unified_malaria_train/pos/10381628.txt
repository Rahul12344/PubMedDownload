to protect cells apoptosis induce apoptosis. tested effect of
tpck two transformed t-cell lines. jurkat t-cells theileria
parva-transformed t-cells shown highly sensitive tpck-induced
growth arrest apoptosis. surprisingly, found thiol antioxidant,
n-acetylcysteine (nac), well l- d-cysteine blocked tpck-induced growth

phosphorylation, nf-kappab dna binding transcriptional activity also
prevented nac cysteine. observations indicate apoptosis and
nf-kappab inhibition induced tpck result modifications sulphydryl
