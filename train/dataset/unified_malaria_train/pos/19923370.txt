background: nutritional status likely plays important role determining 
outcome protozoan infections. despite evidence plasmodium sensitivity
to oxidative stress, potential role vitamin e, free radical scavenger,
on outcome cerebral malaria (cm) yet elucidated.
objective: determine influence vitamin e plasmodium parasite
development murine cm outcome, alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-ttp),
a regulator vitamin e host circulation, abrogated.
design: alpha-ttp knockout mice infected plasmodium berghei anka, and
survival rate, parasitemia, brain histologic alterations, brain barrier
permeability assessed. addition, mrna expression cytokines and
adhesion molecules involved neurologic pathology monitored.
results: alpha-ttp knockout mice infected p. berghei anka exhibit
any clinical pathologic signs cm, histologic analysis brain
tissues animals showed alteration blood-brain barrier integrity
compared control mice. interestingly, protection blood-brain 
barrier infected alpha-ttp knockout mice lost dietary
supplementation vitamin e added diet. moreover, interleukins
and adhesion molecule transcripts brain control mice significantly
up-regulated compared alpha-ttp knockout mice.
conclusion: appears deficiency alpha-tocopherol circulation
prevents cm suggests alpha-ttp putative target early
prevention cm.
