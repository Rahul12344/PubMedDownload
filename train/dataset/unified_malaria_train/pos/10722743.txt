several plasmodium falciparum genes encoding cdc2-related protein kinases have
been identified, modalities regulation remains largely
unexplored. present study, investigated regulation vitro of
pfpk5, putative homologue cdk1 (cdc2) p. falciparum. show (i)
pfpk5 efficiently activated heterologous (human) cyclin h p25, a
cyclin-like molecule specifically activates human cdk5; (ii) activated
enzyme inhibited chemical cdk inhibitors; (iii) pfmrk, putative p.
falciparum homologue cdk-activating kinase, neither activate nor
phosphorylate pfpk5; (iv) pfpk5 able autophosphorylate presence 
of cyclin. taken together, results suggest regulation of
plasmodium cdks may differ important aspects human
counterparts. furthermore, cloned open reading frame encoding novel p.
falciparum protein possessing maximal homology cyclin h various
organisms, show protein, called pfcyc-1, able activate
recombinant pfpk5 vitro efficiency similar human cyclin h
and p25. work opens way development screening procedures aimed
at identifying compounds specifically target parasite cdks.
