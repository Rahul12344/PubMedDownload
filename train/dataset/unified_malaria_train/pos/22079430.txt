cerebral malaria severe form disease may result, part, from
an overt inflammatory response infection plasmodium falciparum. the
understanding pathogenesis cerebral malaria may aid development 
of better therapeutic strategies patients. immune response cerebral
malaria involves elevation circulating levels cytokines chemokines
associated leukocyte accumulation breakdown blood-brain barrier
in central nervous system. platelet-activating factor (paf) mediator 
inflammation shown orchestrate inflammatory processes, including recruitment
of leukocytes increase vascular permeability. using mice lacking paf
receptor (pafr(-/-)), investigated relevance molecule the
outcome neuroinflammatory process triggered p. berghei anka, an
experimental model cerebral malaria. pafr(-/-) mice, lethality markedly
delayed brain inflammation significantly reduced, demonstrated by
histology, accumulation, activation cd8(+) cells, changes vascular
permeability activation caspase-3 endothelial cells leukocytes.
similarly, treatment pafr antagonist uk-74,505 delayed lethality. taken 
together, results suggest pafr signaling crucial development 
of experimental cerebral malaria. mechanistically, pafr activation crucial for
the cascade events leading changes vascular permeability, accumulation, 
and activation cd8(+) cells apoptosis leukocytes endothelial
cells.
