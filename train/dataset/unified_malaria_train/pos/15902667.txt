background: serum concentrations acute phase proteins provide valuable
diagnostic information detection, prognosis, monitoring disease.
information available acute phase response naturally occurring canine
babesiosis limited.
objective: purpose investigation retrospectively evaluate
serum concentrations haptoglobin, c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin in
dogs naturally infected babesia canis.
methods: haptoglobin, c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin concentrations were
measured serum samples dogs uncomplicated (n = 6) complicated (n
= 1) babesiosis compared 6 healthy dogs.
results: serum c-reactive protein ceruloplasmin concentrations were
significantly higher dogs babesiosis; however, serum haptoglobin
concentration significantly lower compared control dogs (p <.01).
conclusions: results study suggest acute phase protein
concentrations could beneficial diagnosis determination the
severity babesiosis dogs.
