background: human babesiosis emerging zoonosis. "babesia venatorum" has
been identified four asplenic men child far. aimed to
describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory characteristics a
series cases "b venatorum" infection identified sentinel hospital in
china.
methods: recruited participants recent tick bite mudanjiang forestry
central hospital, heilongjiang province, china. cases diagnosed pcr 
followed sequencing, microscopic identification, isolation animal
inoculation, both.
findings: 48 individuals (30 women girls; median age 45 years, range 7 months 
to 75 years) "b venatorum" infection identified. 32 these
individuals confirmed cases 16 probable cases. none 48 cases
had received blood transfusion splenectomy. geographically, cases were
distributed diffusely throughout hospital catchment area. 32 confirmed
cases, 21 (66%) presented fever, 13 (41%) headache, 12 (38%) with
myalgia arthralgia, three (9%) chills. 14 (44%) patients fatigue,
eight (25%) dizziness, eight (25%) hypersomnia. six (19%) patients
had erythematous non-pruritic rash around tick-bite site two (6%) 
lymphadenopathy. seven (22%) four (13%) patients anaemia and
thrombocytopenia, respectively, seven (50%) 14 patients confirmed
infection increased hepatic transaminase concentrations. confirmed
cases, concentrations intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (p<0·001), p-selectin 
(p<0·05), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (p<0·001) were
significantly reduced, whereas tumour necrosis factor α (p<0·01) vascular
cell adhesion molecule 1 (p<0·001) significantly increased.
interpretation: "b venatorum" infection included differential
diagnosis patients tick-exposure history areas pathogen
has previously identified ticks people.
funding: natural science foundation china mega-project infectious
diseases.
