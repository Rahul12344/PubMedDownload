the pathology caused acute babesia bovis infection similar seen 
severe human malaria caused plasmodium falciparum infection, related 
to dysregulated production inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide (no). we
have observed induction no, inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and
inflammatory cytokines macrophages b. bovis. furthermore, proliferation 
lymphocytes individuals never exposed certain protozoal pathogens 
induced crude protozoal parasite extracts. repeatedly observed
stimulation naive pbmc cattle antigenic extracts babesia bovis.
based recent studies demonstrating mitogenicity bacterial other
non-vertebrate dnas murine b cells macrophages, mitogenic properties 
of b. bovis dna examined. b. bovis e. coli dnas induced proliferation of
pbmc purified b cells non-exposed cattle. stimulatory activity was
reduced dnase treatment methylation cpg methylase, indicating the
presence stimulatory non-methylated cpg motifs b. bovis genome. b.
bovis e. coli dnas enhanced igg secretion cultured b cells, stimulating
igg1 strongly, igg2. several hexameric cpg immunostimulatory sequences
(iss) active murine b cells identified 11 kb fragment b. bovis 
dna. oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing one (aacgtt), located the
rhoptry associated protein-1 (rap-1) open reading frame, stimulated b cell
proliferation. studies identify potential mechanism protozoal
parasites may modulate host immune responses, leading consequences as
hypergammaglobulinemia splenomegaly. results also support use of
iss vaccine adjuvants enhance type 1 immune responses cattle.
