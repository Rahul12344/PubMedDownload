subcutaneous inoculation 1 ml ground theileria annulata tick tissue
stabilate (0.75 tick equivalent) crossbred calves (n = 6, average age 53
days) resulted development acute theileriosis. percentage
parasitaemia 71.7% +/- 3.3% day 20 inoculation. macroschizonts 
observed lymphocytes monocytes. phagocytosed schizonts observed in
neutrophils, along cytoplasmic vacuolation monocytes neutrophils.
there progressive decrease (p < 0.05) haemoglobin packed cell
volume, along marked reticulocytosis. serum analysis revealed decrease
(p <0.05) concentrations calcium, cholesterol triglycerides, 
there increase (p < 0.05) concentrations blood urea nitrogen 
compared day 0 values. total serum proteins, albumin serum
immunoglobulin concentrations albumin-to-immunoglobulin ratio showed
marked decreases (p<0.05). coagulopathies included thrombocytopenia an
increased prothrombin time, along non-significant increase bleeding
