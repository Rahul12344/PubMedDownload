cerebral malaria (cm) caused plasmodium falciparum parasites often leads to
the death infected patients persisting neurological sequelae despite
anti-parasitic treatments. erythropoietin (epo) recently suggested a
potential adjunctive treatment cm. however diverging results obtained in
patients sub-saharan countries infected p. falciparum. study,
we measured epo levels plasma well-defined groups p.
falciparum-infected patients, state odisha india, mild
malaria (mm), cm, severe non-cm (ncm). epo levels correlated with
biological parameters, including parasite biomass, heme, tumor necrosis factor
(tnf)-α, interleukin (il)-10, interferon gamma-induced protein (ip)-10, and
monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp)-1 plasma concentrations spearman's rank
and multiple correlation analyses. found significant increase epo levels 
with malaria severity degree, specifically fatal cm. addition,
epo levels also found correlated positively heme, tnf-α, il-10, ip-10
and mcp-1 cm. also found significant multivariate correlation between
epo, tnf-α, il-10, ip-10 mcp-1 heme, suggesting association epo 
network immune factors cm patients. contradictory levels circulating
epo reported cm patients india compared africa highlights need 
for optimization adjunctive treatments according targeted
population.
