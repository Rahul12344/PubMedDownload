malaria widespread infectious disease caused parasite plasmodium.
during pregnancy, malaria infection leads range complications can
affect mother fetus, including stillbirth, infant mortality, low
birth weight. study, utilized mouse model placental malaria (pm) 
infection determine importance protein myd88 host immune
response plasmodium pregnancy. initially, demonstrated that
plasmodium berghei nk65gfp adhered placental tissue via chondroitin sulfate 
and induced pm mice c57bl/6 genetic background. evaluate the
involvement myd88 pathology pm, performed histopathological
analysis placentas obtained myd88(-/-) wild-type (wt) mice following 
infection 19th gestational day. data demonstrated detrimental
placental alterations observed infected mice correlated the
expression myd88. moreover, absence protein, production of
interleukin 6 (il-6) tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) significantly
reduced infected mice. importantly, contrast fetuses from
infected wt mice, exhibited reduction body weight, fetuses from
infected myd88(-/-) mice display significant weight loss compared to
their noninfected littermates. addition, observed decrement maternal
care associated malaria infection, attenuated the
myd88-deficient mice. collectively, results study illustrate the
pivotal importance myd88 signaling pathway pathogenesis of
placental malaria, thus presenting new possibilities targeting myd88 in
therapeutic interventions.
