the obligate intracellular liver stage plasmodium parasite represents a
bottleneck parasite life cycle remains promising target for
therapeutic intervention. stage, parasites undergo dramatic
morphological changes achieve one fastest replication rates among
eukaryotic species. nevertheless, relatively little known parasite
interactions host hepatocyte. using immunofluorescence, live cell
imaging electron microscopy, show plasmodium berghei parasites are
surrounded vesicles host late endocytic pathway. found 
vesicles acidic contain membrane markers rab7a, cd63 lamp1. 
host cell vesicle acidification disrupted using ammonium chloride or
concanamycin late liver stage infection, parasite survival was
not affected, schizont size significantly decreased. furthermore, when
the host cell endocytic pathway loaded bsa-gold, gold particles were
found within parasite cytoplasm, showing transport material the
host endocytic pathway toward parasite interior. observations reveal 
novel plasmodium-host interaction suggest vesicles host
endolysosomal pathway could represent important source nutrients exploited 
by fast-growing late liver stage parasites.
