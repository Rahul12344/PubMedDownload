the lipid moiety natural haemozoin (nhz, malarial pigment) previously
shown enhance expression release human monocyte matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9), major role for
15-(s,r)-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-hete), nhz
lipoperoxidation product, proposed. here, underlying mechanisms were
investigated, focusing involvement mitogen-activated protein kinases
(mapks). results showed nhz promoted either early late p38 mapk
phosphorylation; however, nhz modify basal phosphorylation/expression
ratios extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 c-jun n-terminal
kinase-1/2. 15-hete mimicked nhz effects p38 mapk, whereas lipid-free
synthetic (s)hz delipidized (d)hz not. consistently, nhz 15-hete
also promoted phosphorylation mapk-activated protein kinase-2, known p38
mapk substrate; effect abolished sb203580, synthetic p38 mapk
inhibitor. sb203580 also abrogated nhz-dependent 15-hete-dependent
enhancement mmp-9 mrna protein (latent activated forms) levels cell
lysates supernatants. collectively, data suggest human
monocytes, nhz 15-hete upregulate mmp-9 expression secretion through
activation p38 mapk pathway. present work provides new evidence on
mechanisms underlying mmp-9 deregulation malaria, might helpful to
design new specific drugs adjuvant therapy complicated malaria.
