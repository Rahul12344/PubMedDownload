the pathogenic mechanisms underlying occurrence cerebral malaria (cm) 
still incompletely understood but, clearly, cerebral complications may result
from concomitant microvessel obstruction inflammation. extent which
brain edema contributes pathology investigated. using model
of p. berghei anka infection, compared brain microvessel morphology of
cm-susceptible cm-resistant mice. quantitative planimetry, provide
evidence cm characterized enlarged perivascular spaces (pvs). show 
a dramatic aquaporin 4 (aqp4) upregulation, selectively level of
astrocytic foot processes, cm non-cm disease, significantly 
pronounced mice malarial-induced neurological syndrome. suggests
that threshold aqp4 expression needed lead neurovascular pathology,
a view supported significantly higher levels mice clinically
overt cm. numbers intravascular leukocytes significantly correlated 
pvs enlargement aqp4 overexpression. thus, brain edema could a
contributing factor cm pathogenesis aqp4, specifically astrocytic
location, key molecule mechanism. since experimental cm associated
with substantial brain edema, models paediatric cm better adult
syndrome tempting evaluate aqp4 former context. aqp4
changes confirmed human cm, may represent novel target for
therapeutic intervention.
