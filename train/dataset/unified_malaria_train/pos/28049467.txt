background: placental plasmodium falciparum malaria trigger intervillositis, 
a local inflammatory response strongly associated low birthweight 
placental malaria infection alone. fetal growth (and therefore birthweight) is
dependent placental amino acid transport, impaired placental
malaria-associated intervillositis. here, tested hypothesis that
mechanistic target rapamycin (mtor) signaling, pathway known regulate
amino acid transport, inhibited placental malaria-associated
intervillositis, contributing lower birthweight.
methods: determined link intervillositis, mtor signaling activity,
and amino acid uptake tissue biopsies uninfected placentas and
malaria-infected placentas without intervillositis, vitro
model using primary human trophoblast (pht) cells.
results: demonstrated (1) placental mtor activity lower cases of
placental malaria intervillositis, (2) placental mtor activity negatively
correlated degree inflammation, (3) inhibition placental mtor 
activity associated reduced placental amino acid uptake lower
birthweight. pht cells, showed (1) inhibition mtor signaling a
mechanistic link placental malaria-associated intervillositis and
decreased amino acid uptake (2) constitutive mtor activation partially
restores amino acid uptake.
conclusions: data support concept inhibition placental mtor
signaling constitutes mechanistic link placental malaria-associated
intervillositis decreased amino acid uptake, may contribute lower
birthweight. restoring placental mtor signaling placental malaria may increase
birthweight improve neonatal survival, representing new potential
therapeutic approach.
