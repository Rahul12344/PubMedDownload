purpose review: malaria represents one important selective factors
affecting human populations. several inherited diseases red blood cells lead
to resistance erythrocytic stage. among patients experience hereditary
elliptocytosis related mutations erythrocyte membrane proteins, molecular
studies shown prevalence particular spectrin mutations patients
from black ethnic extraction, leading one question selection new
malaria-resistant genes.
recent findings: prospective epidemiological molecular studies west africa
have confirmed prevalence (between 0.6 1.6%) particular spectrin
mutations related hereditary elliptocytosis. studies also revealed 
the frequency alpha-spectrin chain polymorphisms, associated cis with
elliptocytogenic spectrin mutations defining particular spectrin allele
haplotypes. culture studies plasmodium falciparum elliptocytes bearing such
elliptocytogenic alleles spectrin showed alleles supplementary 
genetic factors malaria resistance vitro.
summary: certain instances spectrin mutations polymorphisms yet
been shown constitute new factors innate resistance malaria vivo.
epidemiological surveys hereditary elliptocytosis parasite culture
studies, however, argued relationships parasite and
spectrin-based skeleton examined closely molecular
interactions parasite ligands particular spectrin chain domains
should characterized.
