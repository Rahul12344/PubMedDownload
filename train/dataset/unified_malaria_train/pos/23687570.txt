background: endothelial activation may contribute development severe
disease plasmodium falciparum infection, optimal markers endothelial 
activation severe malaria, extent endothelial activation in
asymptomatic infection, effect blood group endothelial activation
have defined.
methods: serum levels 3 markers endothelial activation-von willebrand
factor (vwf), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sicam-1), soluble
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (svcam-1)-were assessed ugandan children
with cerebral malaria (cm) (n = 86), children uncomplicated malaria (um)
(n = 81), community children (cc) (n = 90).
results: serum vwf, sicam-1, svcam-1 levels elevated asymptomatic
community children microscopy-confirmed parasitemia compared with
children without parasitemia microscopy polymerase chain reaction (all,
p ≤ .05). levels vwf, sicam-1, svcam-1 higher children um
than cc (all, p < 0.001), vwf levels effectively distinguished cm
from um (p < 0.001), finding confirmed receiver operating characteristic
analyses (area curve = 0.67; 95% confidence interval, .58-.75). von
willebrand factor levels lower children blood group versus non-o
blood groups across disease spectrum, vwf levels remained higher cm
versus um, even controlling blood group.
conclusions: endothelial activation, assessed serum levels vwf, sicam-1,
and svcam-1, occurs even subclinical p. falciparum parasitemia. von willebrand
factor levels increase greater malaria disease severity. blood group is
associated lower vwf levels, presence blood group alone not
explain higher vwf levels seen children cm.
