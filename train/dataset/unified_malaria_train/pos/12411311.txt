infection bovine cells b cells intracellular protozoan parasite
theileria parva induces transformed phenotype characteristics comparable
to leukemic cells. transformed phenotype reverts drug-induced parasite
death, cured lymphocytes acquire resting phenotype eventually die
by apoptosis stimulated. here, show lymphocyte
proliferation activation transcription factor ap-1 mediated by
src-family protein tyrosine kinases (ptks) parasite-dependent fashion.
src-family ptks known present glycolipid-enriched microdomains
(gems), also called lipid rafts, negatively regulated ptk csk
complexed tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane adapter protein pag
(phosphoprotein associated gems) also called cbp (csk-binding protein). we, 
therefore, purified gems proliferating infected b cells from
growth-arrested cells drug-cured parasites. proliferation arrest
led striking increase pag/cbp expression; correspondingly, amount 
csk associated pag/cbp gems increased markedly, whereas ptk hck
accumulation gem fractions alter growth arrest. propose that
theileria-induced lymphocyte proliferation permanent activation hck stems 
from down-regulation pag/cbp concomitant constitutive loss the
negative regulator csk gems transformed b cells.
