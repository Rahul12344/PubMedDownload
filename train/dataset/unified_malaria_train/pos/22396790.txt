placental malaria common clinical complication pregnancy is
associated abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth retardation and
low birth weight. present study designed delineate underlying
mechanism placental pathology malarial infection special reference
to oxidative stress apoptosis. experimentally, pregnant balb/c mice were
infected plasmodium berghei infected red blood cells gestation day 10.
the presence malarial infection placenta confirmed histopathological
studies. observation infected placenta plugged placental
sinusoids parasitized red blood cells malarial pigments. interestingly, 
we found significant increase level malondialdehyde, index of
oxidative stress decreased activity catalase, antioxidant infected 
placenta. furthermore, infected placenta oxidative stress mediated
apoptosis determined dna fragmentation assay, ethidium bromide/acridine
orange staining caspase activity. observed oxidative stress begin
after second day malarial infection. interestingly, observed there
was regulation anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 regulation of
pro-apoptotic protein bax infected placenta, suggesting involvement of
mitochondrial pathway apoptosis confirmed activation of
caspase 9. however, change expression fas gene caspase 8
activity, indicated absence death receptor pathway. thus, be
concluded placental pathology malarial infection mediated by
mitochondrial pathway apoptosis occurring due augmented lipid peroxidation 
which may turn jeopardise materno-fetal relationship.
