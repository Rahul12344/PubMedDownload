background: severe fatal malaria associated dysregulated host
inflammatory responses infection. chitinase 3-like 1 (chi3l1) secreted
glycoprotein implicated regulating immune responses. expression function
of chi3l1 malaria infection investigated.
methods: plasma levels chi3l1 quantified case-control study of
ugandan children presenting plasmodium falciparum malaria. chi3l1 levels
were compared children uncomplicated malaria (um; n = 53), severe
malarial anaemia (sma; n = 59) cerebral malaria (cm; n = 44) using the
kruskall wallis-test, evaluated utility predicting fatal (n = 23)
versus non-fatal (n = 80) outcomes severe disease using mann whitney u
test, receiver operating characteristic curves, combinatorial analysis.
co-culture p. falciparum human peripheral blood mononuclear cells the
plasmodium berghei anka experimental model cerebral malaria used to
examine role chi3l1 severe malaria.
results: children presenting falciparum malaria, chi3l1 levels were
increased sma cm versus um (p < 0.001). among severe malaria cases, chi3l1
levels presentation predicted subsequent death (area receiver operating 
characteristic curve 0.84 [95% ci 0.76-0.92]) combination host 
biomarkers, predicted mortality high sensitivity (100% [85.7-100]) and
specificity (81.3% [71.3-88.3]). plasmodium falciparum stimulated chi3l1
production human peripheral blood mononuclear cells vitro. chi3l1 was
increased plasma brain tissue experimental cerebral malaria, but
targeted chi3l1 deletion alter cytokine production survival this
model.
conclusions: data suggest plasma chi3l1 measured presentation
correlates malaria severity predicts outcome paediatric sma cm,
but support causal role chi3l1 cerebral malaria pathobiology in
the model tested.
