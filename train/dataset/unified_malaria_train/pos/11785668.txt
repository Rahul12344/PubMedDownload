incidence apoptosis investigated spleen lymph nodes +/+,
cd18 -/- urokinase receptor (upar, cd87) -/- mice, untreated plasmodium
berghei anka (pba) infected. non infected mice, incidence apoptosis was
lower lymph nodes cd18 -/- upar -/- +/+ mice, seen by
facs analysis count number hypodiploid annexin-v binding cells.
infection mice pba resulted marked increase size spleen
and lymph nodes 7-8 days infection, slightly higher upar -/-
and cd 18 -/- +/+ mice. pba infection increased 7 fold the
incidence apoptosis lymphoid organs +/+, especially white
pulp germinal centers spleen lymph nodes, contrast was
unchanged pba infected cd 18 -/- upar -/- mice. serum igg levels, and
number circulating leukocytes significantly higher upar cd18 
-/- +/+ mice. results indicate cd18 upar surface
molecules, known associated cell membrane, an
important influence upon incidence cell survival normal or
stimulated lymphoid organs.
