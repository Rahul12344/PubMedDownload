severe malaria represents clinical spectrum disease. propose innate 
immune inflammatory responses malaria play key roles pathogenesis and
clinical outcomes distinct severe malaria syndromes. investigate this
hypothesis, mice deficient irak4, central toll-like receptor (tlr)-mediated
signaling, studied two experimental models malaria: plasmodium berghei
(pba) plasmodium chabaudi (pccas). irak4(-/-)mice decreased
pro-inflammatory cytokine production infection models. however,
animals relatively protected pba-associated symptoms compared with
wild-type mice, whereas irak4(-/-) animals susceptible to
pccas-associated disease. results show irak4-mediated innate immune
inflammatory responses play critical roles divergent clinical outcomes in
murine malaria models. such, integrated approaches, using one model,
are required fully understand parasite/host interactions characterize
severe malaria, importantly, fully assess effect adjunctive
therapies targeting innate immune responses malaria.
