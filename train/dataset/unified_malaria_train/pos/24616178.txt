the polymorphism 677c>t (nm_005957.4:c.665c>t/p.ala222val, rs1801133:c>t) in
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) results mild enzymatic deficiency 
and increased risk several complex traits including adverse reproductive
outcomes, birth defects, heart disease. despite deleterious effects,
homozygosity high (5%-15%) many populations, among highest in
mediterranean regions, malaria historically endemic may have
conferred selective advantage mutations. infected mthfr-deficient 
(mthfr(+) (/-) ) mthfr overexpressing (mthfr(tg) ) mice plasmodium
berghei anka induce cerebral malaria. mthfr(+/-) mice survived longer
(p < 0.02, log-rank test), mthfr(tg) mice died earlier (p < 0.05, log-rank
test) infection compared wild-type littermates. flow cytometry
revealed increased lymphocyte populations increased ccr4(+) nk cells in
spleen mthfr(+) (/-) mice; mthfr(tg) animals decreased numbers nk
cells. interferon-γ interleukin-10 immunoreactive proteins increased and
decreased, respectively, brain mthfr(+/-) mice compared wild-type. 
suggest mild mthfr deficiency protects malarial infection that
this phenomenon may led high frequency 677c>t/c.665c>t variant
in human populations.
