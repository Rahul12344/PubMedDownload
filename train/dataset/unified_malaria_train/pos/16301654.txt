human nk cells respond rapidly plasmodium falciparum-infected rbc (irbc)
to produce ifn-gamma. study, examined heterogeneity this
response among malaria-naive blood donors. cells donors become partially
activated (up-regulating cd69, perforin, granzyme) upon exposure irbc 
cells subset donors become fully activated (additionally
up-regulating cd25, ifn-gamma, surface expression lysosomal-associated
membrane protein 1 (lamp-1)). although cd56dim cd56bright nk cell
populations express ifn-gamma response irbc, cd25 lamp-1 are
up-regulated cd56dim nk cells cd69 up-regulated greater
extent subset; contrast, perforin granzyme preferentially
up-regulated cd56bright nk cells. nk cells expressing ifn-gamma response to
irbc always coexpress cd69 cd25 rarely lamp-1, suggesting individual
nk cells respond irbc either ifn-gamma production cytotoxicity.
furthermore, physical contact irbc can, proportion donors, lead to
nk cell cytoskeletal reorganization suggestive functional interactions between
the cells. observations imply individuals may vary ability to
mount innate immune response malaria infection obvious implications
for disease resistance susceptibility.
