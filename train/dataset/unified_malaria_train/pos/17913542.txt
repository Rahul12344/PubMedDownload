the cytoadhesion plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies) organ
microvessels key event pathogenesis cerebral malaria pulmonary
edema. identification molecules involved interaction ies
and endothelial cells major goal research severe forms of
malaria. contrast, consequences cytoadhesion endothelial cells have
been largely ignored. combining phenotypic selection, cytoadhesion assays 
flow cytometry, demonstrated cytoadhesion csa-binding ies
inhibited cytoadhesion cd36-binding ies. identified cd44 signal
receptor csa-binding ies cytoadhesion, demonstrated signal was
transduced cd36 pathway involving src-kinase family mek.
cd36-mediated cytoadhesion modulated independently changes cd36
expression. results provide first evidence ies can
downregulate cytoadhesion ies another phenotype, modifying
endothelial cells via signaling pathway relating cd44 cd36. mimicking this
phenomenon may constitute interesting therapeutic strategy inhibiting 
adhesion cd36-binding ies -- abundant phenotype among field isolates 
-- promoting degradation spleen.
