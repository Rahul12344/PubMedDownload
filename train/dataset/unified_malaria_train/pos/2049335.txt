this study analyzed effect infection mice virulent strain of
plasmodium chabaudi natural autoantibodies. mice received appropriate
treatments order survive serum autoantibodies characterized
either enzyme immunoassays panel self non-self antigens by
western immunoblots using fibroblast red blood cell (rbc) extracts. igm and
mainly igg antibodies directed actin, myoglobin, myosin, spectrin,
tubulin, trinitrophenylated-ovalbumin found days the
parasitemia peak, persisted several weeks parasite clearance, and
returned almost normal levels 2 months. following challenge with
parasitized rbcs, similar increase antibodies observed, levels
remaining high 20 days post-injection still remaining twice normal
level 1 month later. western blotting detected autoantibodies many membrane
rbc proteins, e.g. spectrin, band 3 related polypeptides, well 
against fibroblast constituents, tubulin, actin, 70 kd heat shock
protein. autoantibodies seemed polyspecific, since eluted from
infected mouse rbcs igg antibodies infected mouse sera
affinity-purified mouse tubulin immunoadsorbent reacted antigens of
the panel, including parasite extracts. surprisingly, mice recovered
from infection, autoantibody levels, particularly anti-spectrin anti-band 3, 
rose injection high dose normal instead parasitized
rbcs.(abstract truncated 250 words)
