background: various factors impact severity malaria, including the
nutritional status host. vitamin e, intra extracellular
anti-oxidant, one nutrient whose absence shown previously to
negatively affect plasmodium development. however, mechanisms plasmodium 
inhibition, addition means exploit finding a
therapeutic strategy, remain unclear.
methods: alpha-ttp knockout mice infected plasmodium berghei nk65 or
plasmodium yoelii xl-17, parasitaemia, survival rate monitored. one part 
of experiments mice fed supplemented diet vitamin e then
infected. addition, parasite dna damage monitored means comet assay 
and 8-ohdg test. moreover, infected mice treated chloroquine and
parasitaemia survival rate monitored.
results: inhibition alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-ttp), a
determinant vitamin e concentration circulation, confers resistance to
malarial infection result oxidative damage parasites. furthermore,
in combination anti-malarial drug chloroquine results even more
dramatic.
conclusion: considering knockout mice lack observable negative impacts
typical vitamin e deficiency, results suggest inhibition of
alpha-ttp activity liver may useful strategy prevention and
treatment malaria infection. moreover, combined strategy alpha-ttp
inhibition chloroquine treatment might effective drug resistant
parasites.
