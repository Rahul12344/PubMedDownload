acute babesia bovis infections: plasma creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and
creatinine levels associated muscle damage.

wright ig, mckenna rv, goodger bv.

two groups five two-year-old hereford steers infected two virulent
strains b. bovis. plasma concentrations creatine kinase (ck), lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh), creatinine rose early infection showed highly
significant increases terminally. extensive skeletal muscle degeneration was
observed terminally degeneration myocardium, although much
less extensive. terminal clinical signs included posterior muscle wasting,
weakness, recumbency. concluded extensive changes muscle
and ck ldh caused anoxia due primarily shock stasis 
circulation induced parasites.
