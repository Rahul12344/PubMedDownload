the balance pro-inflammatory regulatory immune responses in
determining optimal cell activation vital successful resolution of
microbial infections. balance maintained part negative
regulators cell activation, ctla-4 pd-1/pd-l, dampen effector
responses chronic infections. however, role acute infections,
such malaria, remains less clear. study, determined the
contribution ctla-4 pd-1/pd-l regulation cell responses during
plasmodium berghei anka (pba)-induced experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) in
susceptible (c57bl/6) resistant (balb/c) mice. found expression
of ctla-4 pd-1 cells correlates extent pro-inflammatory
responses induced pba infection, higher c57bl/6 balb/c
mice. thus, ecm develops despite high levels expression inhibitory
receptors. however, antibody-mediated blockade either ctla-4 or
pd-1/pd-l1, pd-1/pd-l2, pathways pba-infection in
ecm-resistant balb/c mice resulted higher levels cell activation,
enhanced ifn-γ production, increased intravascular arrest parasitised
erythrocytes cd8(+) cells brain, augmented incidence ecm.
thus, ecm-resistant balb/c mice, ctla-4 pd-1/pd-l1 represent essential,
independent non-redundant pathways maintaining cell homeostasis 
a virulent malaria infection. moreover, neutralisation ifn-γ depletion of
cd8(+) cells pba infection shown reverse pathologic effects
of regulatory pathway blockade, highlighting aetiology ecm the
balb/c mice similar c57bl/6 mice. summary, results
underscore differential complex regulation governs immune responses 
to malaria parasites.
