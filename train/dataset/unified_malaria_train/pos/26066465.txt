in erythrocytes, malaria parasite entry infection mediated through
complex membrane sorting signaling processes. investigated effects 
single-locus multilocus interactions test hypothesis members 
of gpcr family genes, adenosine a2a receptor (adora2a) g-protein coupled 
receptor kinase5 (grk5), may contribute pathogenesis malaria caused 
plasmodium falciparum (pf) independently complex interactions. a
case-control study adults, individuals affected pf malaria (complicated
n=168; uncomplicated n=282) healthy controls (n=450) tested their
association four known snps grk5 (rs2230345, rs2275036, rs4752307 and
rs11198918) two adora2a (rs9624472 rs5751876) genes malaria
susceptibility, using techniques polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphisms direct dna sequencing. single-locus analysis
showed significant association 2 snps; rs5751876 (or=3.2(2.0-5.2); p=0.0006)
of adora2a rs2230345 (or=0.3(0.2-0.5); p=0.0006) grk5 malaria. the
mean serum creatinine levels significantly higher patients with
variant gg (p=0.006) rs9624472 adora2a gene compared aa ag genotypes
in complicated pf malaria cases, g allele also showing increased risk
for malaria (or=1.3(1.1-1.6); p=0.017). analyses predicted haplotypes the
two adora2a four grk5 snps identified haplotypes conferred 
risk well resistance malaria statistical significance. molecular
docking analysis evolutionary rs2230345 snp indicated stable activity of
grk5 mutant allele compared wild type. further, generalized
multifactor dimensionality reduction test contribution individual
effects six polymorphisms higher-order interactions risk of
symptoms/clinical complications malaria suggested best six-locus model
showing statistical significance. study provides evidence role of
adora2a grk5 might influence etiology malaria infection.
