changes coagulation parameters studied dogs naturally infected with
babesia canis canis (n = 30), haemostasis evaluated compared to
values obtained healthy dogs (n = 29). date, any
studies examining dynamics thrombin-antithrombin complex formation in
cases canine babesiosis. coagulation parameters evaluated (day 0) and
on days 1, 2, 3 treatment imidocarb (6 mg/kg inj. s.c.) included
the determination platelet counts, formation thrombin-antithrombin
complexes (tat), prothrombin time (pt), activated partial thromboplastin time
(aptt) antithrombin iii (at iii) activity. tat complexes significantly
elevated animals babesiosis days 0 2 (mean 49.7 87.7 microg/l 
vs. control, 7.2 microg/l). iii activity significantly decreased all
time-points examined. differences pt. days 2 3 aptt
was significantly shortened infected dogs compared control animals
(means 21.3 19.2 vs. control, 30.0 s). analysis demonstrated that
infected dogs significant thrombocytopenia course study
(mean day 0 - 29 x 10(9) /l, day 1 - 48 x 10(9) /l, day 2 - 47 x 10(9) /l day
3 - 87 x 10(9) /l, vs. control -259 x 10(9) /l). data suggest that
babesiosis dogs compromise primary secondary haemostasis that
induction disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) occurs canine
babesiosis.
