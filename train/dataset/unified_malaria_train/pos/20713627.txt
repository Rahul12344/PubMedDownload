clearing blood-stage malaria parasites without inducing major host pathology
requires finely tuned balance pro- anti-inflammatory responses. the
interplay regulatory (treg) cells dendritic cells (dcs) one of
the key determinants balance. although experimental models revealed 
various patterns treg cell expansion, dc maturation, cytokine production
according infecting malaria parasite species, studies compared all

parasite loads correlated neither intensity clinical symptoms nor
