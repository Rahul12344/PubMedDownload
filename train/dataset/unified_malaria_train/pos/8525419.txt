serum transcobalamin ii (tcii) levels determined 56 patients p.
falciparum malaria infection. divided 3 groups: severe (malarial
parasite > 5% patients cerebral malaria renal insufficiency), moderate
(1-5% infection without complications) mild (1% infection). elevated serum
tcii values found patients severe malaria infection. these
values correlated directly parasitemia, blood urea nitrogen creatinine, 
but correlated alkaline phosphatase. 17 patients azotemia
had elevated serum tcii levels 3 patients normal bun and
creatinine concentrations serum tcii levels within normal limits. these
findings indicated malarial patients renal insufficiency increased 
serum tcii. possible mechanism reduced tcii-b12 filtered through
the glomeruli due reduced renal blood flow decreased uptake
by proximal tubular cells resulting decreased degradation tcii the
tubular lysosomal enzymes. determination serum tcii level may used an
indicator renal function malarial patients renal insufficiency.
