cerebral malaria characterized cytoadhesion plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells (pf-irbcs) endothelial cells brain,
disruption blood-brain barrier, cerebral microhemorrhages. no
available antimalarial drugs specifically target endothelial disruptions
underlying complication, responsible majority of
malaria-associated deaths. here, demonstrated ruptured pf-irbcs
induce activation β-catenin, leading disruption inter-endothelial cell
junctions human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hbmecs). inhibition 
β-catenin-induced tcf/lef transcription nucleus hbmecs prevented the
disruption endothelial junctions, confirming β-catenin key mediator 
of p. falciparum adverse effects endothelial integrity. blockade the
angiotensin ii type 1 receptor (at1) stimulation type 2 receptor (at2) 
abrogated pf-irbc-induced activation β-catenin prevented disruption of
hbmec monolayers. mouse model cerebral malaria, modulation angiotensin
ii receptors produced similar effects, leading protection cerebral
malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, increased survival. contrast,
at2-deficient mice susceptible cerebral malaria. interrelation
of β-catenin angiotensin ii signaling pathways opens immediate
host-targeted therapeutic possibilities cerebral malaria diseases
in brain endothelial integrity compromised.
