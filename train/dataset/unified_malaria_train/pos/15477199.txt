background objectives: plasmodium falciparum malaria one most
lethal infectious diseases afflicting humanity. development within the
erythrocyte, p. falciparum induces significant modifications structure and
function human erythrocyte membrane. study focused the
identification new protein-protein interactions host parasite.
design methods: novel application vitro display technology used: 
p. falciparum phage display expression libraries screened purified
human erythrocyte protein 4.1. dna sequencing bioinformatic analyses were
used identify parasite proteins bind protein 4.1.
results: p. falciparum proteins displaying strong binding specificity toward
protein 4.1 included five hypothetical proteins, erythrocyte binding antigen-175,
erythrocyte binding ligand-1 like protein putative serine/threonine kinase.
a common binding motif displaying homology muscle myosin neurofilament
sequences also identified four eight proteins.
interpretation conclusions: proteins potentially involved the
invasion and/or release, well growth survival malaria parasites 
during development red blood cell. characterization novel protein
interactions p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 4.1 lead
to better understanding malaria pathogenesis parasite biology.
