theileria parva tick-transmitted intracellular protozoan parasite that
causes east coast fever, fatal bovine lymphoproliferative disease. the
molecular mechanisms underlie host cell transformation t. parva schizonts
have studied extensively, known nuclear factor-kappa b
(nf-kappab) activated schizont-infected cells, making t. parva-transformed 
cells resistant apoptosis. however, mechanism parasite
triggers activation nf-kappab remains enigmatic. present study, 
biochemically characterized novel protein, termed tpscop (t.
parvaschizont-derived cytoskeleton-binding protein), expressed the
schizont stage t. parva. tpscop shown interact f-actin vitro.
expression tpscop murine lymphocytic cell line resulted activation
of nf-kappab signaling pathways, leading apoptosis resistance. activation 
of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), including extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk) c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), also
detected. furthermore, introduction tpscop t. parva-infected cells
also enhanced activation nf-kappab. first report to
demonstrate parasite-derived molecule ability activate host
nf-kappab pathway. based results, tpscop likely plays important role 
in apoptosis inhibition theileria infection.
