the brazilian amazon hypo-endemic malaria region nearly 300,000 cases
each year. variety genetic polymorphisms, particularly erythrocyte
receptors immune response related genes, described associated
with susceptibility resistance malaria. order identify polymorphisms
that might associated malaria clinical outcomes brazilian amazonian 
population, sixty-four human single nucleotide polymorphisms 37 genes were
analyzed using sequenom massarray iplex platform. total 648 individuals
from two malaria endemic areas studied, including 535 malaria cases (113
individuals clinical mild malaria, 122 individuals asymptomatic
infection 300 individuals history previous mild malaria) 113
health controls history malaria. data revealed significant
associations (p<0.003) one snp il10 gene (rs1800896) one snp
in tlr4 gene (rs4986790) reduced risk clinical malaria, one snp in
the irf1 gene (rs2706384) increased risk clinical malaria, one snp in
the lta gene (rs909253) protection clinical malaria one snp 
tnf gene (rs1800750) associated susceptibility clinical malaria. also, 
new association found snp ctl4 gene (rs2242665), located 
the major histocompatibility complex iii region, reduced risk clinical
malaria. study represents first association study amazonian
population involving large number host genetic polymorphisms with
susceptibility resistance plasmodium infection malaria outcomes.
further studies include larger number individuals, refined parameters
and fine-scale map obtained dna sequencing increase knowledge of
the amazonian population genetic diversity.
