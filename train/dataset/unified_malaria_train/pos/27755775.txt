a 9-year-old, female maltese dog referred veterinary school of
toulouse 2-day history anorexia weakness. clinical examination, 
the dog hyperthermia (39.7°c), abdominal discomfort, polypnea.
significant laboratory findings included pigmenturia, hyperbilirubinemia,
hypercreatininemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, abnormal snap canine pancreas-specific
lipase, pancytopenia nonregenerative anemia. peripheral blood smear 
revealed numerous intraerythrocytic large babesia polychromasia. was
a discrepancy absolute automated reticulocyte count (sysmex
reticulocyte count: 60 × 109 /l; ri 19.4-150.1 × 109 /l) manual
reticulocyte count (3.6 × 109 /l) well absence polychromasia. the
optical red blood cell scattergram showed abnormal isolated reticulocyte
cluster location low-fluorescence ratio cells. findings were
interpreted erythrocytes parasitized large babesia. discrepancy between
