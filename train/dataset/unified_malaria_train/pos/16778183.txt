theileria parasites infect transform bovine lymphocytes resulting tumors
with metastatic/invasive potential. importantly, cellular transformation is
reversed upon drug-induced parasite death, infected lymphocyte dies of
apoptosis within 48 hours. theileria-dependent transformation leads the
constitutive activation c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (both jnk1 jnk2) and
permanent induction activator protein-1. inactivation jnk (following
transfection dominant-negative mutants, treatment jnk-specific
inhibitor) leads lymphocyte apoptosis, suggesting antiapoptotic role for
jnk activation theileria-induced b cell transformation. theileria-induced jnk 
activation also leads constitutive c-jun phosphorylation, inhibition of
c-jun activator protein-1 transactivation following expression a
dominant-negative mutant c-jun sensitizes theileria-transformed b cells to
apoptosis, significantly affect proliferation. thus, jnk
activation c-jun induction overlapping, nonidentical antiapoptotic
roles theileria-induced b cell transformation. increased sensitivity to
apoptosis may related fact expression levels antiapoptotic 
proteins mcl-1 c-iap reduced upon c-jun inhibition. addition, 
decreased c-jun expression correlates impaired ability transfected b 
cells degrade synthetic matrix vitro, injection lymphoid
mice gives rise significantly less smaller tumors. combined, data
argue role jnk c-jun induction survival metastasis of
theileria-transformed b cells. similarity theileria-transformed b
cells human b lymphomas argues exploiting reversible nature of
theileria-induced transformation could throw light mechanisms underlying
human malignancies.
