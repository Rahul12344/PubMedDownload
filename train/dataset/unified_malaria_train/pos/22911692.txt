phagocytic cells represent important line innate defense against
microorganisms. uptake microorganisms cells involves formation of
a phagosome matures fusing endocytic compartments, resulting in
killing enclosed microbe. small gtpases rab family key
regulators vesicular trafficking endocytic pathway. intracellular
pathogens interfere function proteins order subvert
host immune responses. however, unknown subversion achieved 
through modulation rab gene expression. compared expression level
of 23 distinct rab gtpases mouse macrophages infection the
protozoan plasmodium berghei, bacteria escherichia coli salmonella
enterica. found p. berghei induces increase expression a
different set rab genes e. coli s. enterica, behaved similarly.
strikingly, one rab proteins whose expression increased p.
berghei, namely rab14, silenced, observed significant increase the
phagocytosis p. berghei, whereas rab14 overexpression led decrease in
phagocytosis. suggests parasite might induce increase rab14 
expression advantage. similarly, rab9a, whose expression was
increased e. coli s. enterica, silenced, observed increase in
the phagocytosis bacterial species, whereas rab9a overexpression caused a
reduction phagocytosis. suggests modulation rab gene 
expression could represent mechanism immune evasion. thus, study
analyzes modulation rab gene expression induced bacteria protozoa
and suggests modulation could necessary success microbial
infection.
