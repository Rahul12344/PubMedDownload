disease tolerance defense strategy limits fitness costs of
infection irrespectively pathogen burden. restricting iron (fe)
availability pathogens perceived host defense strategy, resulting 
tissue fe overload cytotoxic promote tissue damage exacerbate
disease severity. examining interplay malaria, disease caused 
plasmodium infection, find expression fe sequestering protein
ferritin h chain (fth) mice, ferritin humans, associated with
reduced tissue damage irrespectively pathogen burden. fth protection relies on
its ferroxidase activity, prevents labile fe sustaining proapoptotic
c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) activation. fth expression inhibited jnk
activation, promoting tissue fe overload, tissue damage, malaria severity.
mimicking fth's antioxidant effect inhibiting jnk activation pharmacologically
confers therapeutic tolerance malaria mice. thus, fth provides metabolic
adaptation tissue fe overload, conferring tolerance malaria.
