the regulatory mechanisms cyclin dependent protein kinases (cdks) are
well understood highly conserved eukaryotes. cdks malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, appear regulated similar manner 
regard cyclin binding phosphorylation. order understand
their regulatory mechanisms, examined two classes cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitors (cdis) inhibit panel plasmodial cdks. find pfmrk and
pfpk5 inhibited heterologous p21(cip1) varying degrees inhibition.
in contrast, pfpk6, kinase sequence features characteristic cdk 
and map kinase, unaffected cdi. furthermore, cdk4/6 specific cdi, 
p16(ink4), fails inhibit plasmodial cdks. taken together, results 
suggest plasmodial cdks may regulated binding inhibitory
proteins vivo.
