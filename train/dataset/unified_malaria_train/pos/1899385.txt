lymphocytes infected intracellular parasite theileria parva proliferate 
continuously lymphoblastoid cell lines. previously shown the
continuous proliferation t. parva-infected (tpi) cell line tpm(803) is
mediated part autocrine mechanism (dobbelaere, d. a. e. et al., proc.
natl. acad. sci. usa 1988. 85:4730). report continuous proliferation 
also requires surface stimulation cell-cell contact. standard
culture conditions surface stimulus provided infected cells
themselves, also provided uninfected lymphocytes macrophages.
the ability respond surface stimulation critically dependent the
presence parasite host cell lost within 48 h the
elimination parasite host cell cytoplasm treatment the
theilericidal drug bw720c. tpi cells also secrete growth factor able
to support proliferation diluted tpi cells. growth factor secretion is
rapidly lost upon elimination parasite. moreover, inhibition experiments
using anti-interleukin 2 (il 2) antibodies show il 2 involved the
proliferation tpi cell lines tpm(803) in10. cell proliferation is
dependent number costimulatory signals normally provided by
accessory cells. finding tpi cells mutually stimulate 
grow absence conventional accessory cells helps explain can
escape normal constraints cell growth, allowing invade and
multiply non-lymphoid well lymphoid tissues.
