background: differentiating cerebral malaria (cm) causes serious
illness african children problematic, owing non-specific nature of
the clinical presentation high prevalence incidental parasitaemia. cm 
is associated endothelial activation. study tested hypothesis
that endothelium-derived biomarkers associated pathophysiology of
severe malaria may help identify children cm.
methods findings: plasma samples tested children recruited with
uncomplicated malaria (um; n = 32), cerebral malaria retinopathy (cm-r;
n = 38), clinically defined cm without retinopathy (cm-n; n = 29), non-malaria
febrile illness decreased consciousness (cns; n = 24). admission levels of
angiopoietin-2 (ang-2), ang-1, soluble tie-2 (stie-2), von willebrand factor
(vwf), propeptide (vwfpp), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), soluble
icam-1 (sicam-1) interferon-inducible protein 10 (ip-10) measured by
elisa. children cm-r significantly higher median levels ang-2,
ang-2:ang-1, stie-2, vwfpp sicam-1 compared children cm-n. children
with cm-r significantly lower median levels ang-1 higher median
concentrations ang-2:ang-1, stie-2, vwf, vwfpp, vegf sicam-1 compared to
um, significantly lower median levels ang-1 higher median levels of
ang-2, ang-2:ang-1, vwf vwfpp compared children fever altered
consciousness due causes. ang-1 best discriminator um
and cm-r cns cm-r (areas roc curve 0.96 0.93,
respectively). comparison biomarker levels cm-r admission and
recovery showed uniform increases ang-1 levels, suggesting biomarker may 
have utility monitoring clinical response.
conclusions: results suggest endothelial proteins informative
biomarkers malarial disease severity. results require validation in
prospective studies confirm group biomarkers improves the
diagnostic accuracy cm similar conditions causing fever altered
consciousness.
