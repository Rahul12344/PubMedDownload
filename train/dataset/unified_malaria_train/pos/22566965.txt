the host response following malaria infection depends fine balance between
levels pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory mediators resulting the
resolution infection immune-mediated pathology. whilst components
of innate immune system contribute pro-inflammatory milieu, cells
play major role. blood-stage malaria, cd4(+) γδ cells major
producers ifn-γ controls parasitemia, however, role th17 cells 
secreting il-17a cytokines, including il-17f il-22 yet been
investigated malaria. th17 cells shown play role some
protozoan infections, also source pro-inflammatory cytokines

study, investigated whether il-17a il-22 induced a
plasmodium chabaudi infection mice, whether cytokines contribute 
either protection pathology induced infection. although small
numbers il-17- il-22-producing cd4 cells induced spleens of
infected mice, pronounced induction observed liver, where
increases mrna il-17a and, lesser extent, il-22 observed and
cd8(+) cells, rather cd4 cells, major source cytokines in
this organ. although lack il-17 affect outcome infection or
pathology, lack il-22 resulted 50% mortality within 12 days infection

our observations support idea il-22 il-17 provides protection
