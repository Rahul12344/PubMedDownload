the present study undertaken investigate influence tropical
theileriosis serum constituents, erythrocytes platelets pictures to
study correlation studied parameters. total number 26 cows
were subjected study. 16 cows suffered theileria
infection. comparing theileria infected group control group revealed
significant decreases total rbcs counts (p < 0.01), haemoglobin concentration 
(p < 0.01), packed cell volume (pcv) (p < 0.01), platelets count (plt)
(p < 0.01), plateletcrit (pct) (p < 0.01), significant decreases serum total
proteins (p < 0.01), albumin (p < 0.01), calcium (p < 0.01), phosphorus
(p < 0.01) levels, significant increases serum blood urea nitrogen (bun)
(p < 0.05) creatinine (p < 0.05) levels, serum aspartate
aminotransferase (p < 0.01) gamma glutamyl transferase (ggt) (p < 0.01)
activities. correlations serum biochemical parameters revealed
significant positive correlations total proteins albumin
(r = 0.598*), a/g ratio albumin (r = 0.860**), calcium albumin
(r = 0.729*), calcium a/g ratio (r = 0.752*), ggt bun (r = 0.539*), and
significant negative correlations a/g ratio globulins (r = -0.809**) 
and glucose albumin (r = -0.614*). erythrocytes count showed a
significant negative correlation mean corpuscular volume (mcv)
(r = -0.966**) red blood cells distribution width (rdw) (r = -0.909**). mcv
showed significant positive correlation rdw (r = 0.860*) pcv
(r = 0.781*). rdw positively correlated pcv (r = 0.966**). plt count
showed significant positive correlation mean platelet volume (mpv)
(r = 0.992**), platelets distribution width (pdw) (r = 0.956**) pct
(r = 0.994**). furthermore, mpv showed significant positive correlation with
pdw (r = 0.940**) negative correlation pct (r = -0.974**). pdw was
negatively correlated pct (r = -0.974**). could concluded that
theileria infection cattle resulted anaemia, thrombocytopenia,
hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia hypophosphataemia, addition hepatic 
and kidney dysfunction.
