background: accumulating evidence host heparan sulphate
proteoglycans play important role life cycle plasmodium through
their heparan sulphate chains, suggesting genetic variations genes
involved heparan sulphate biosynthesis may influence parasitaemia.
interestingly, hs3st3a1 hs3st3b1 encoding enzymes involved the
biosynthesis heparan sulphate located within chromosomal region linked
to plasmodium chabaudi parasitaemia mice. suggests hs3st3a1 and
hs3st3b1 may influence p. falciparum parasitaemia humans.
methods: polymorphisms within hs3st3a1 hs3st3b1 identified 270
individuals belonging 44 pedigrees living burkina faso. linkage and
association parasitaemia polymorphisms assessed merlin 
and fbat. genetic interaction analysis also conducted based pgmdr
approach.
results: linkage p. falciparum parasitaemia chromosomal region
containing hs3st3a1 hs3st3b1 detected basis 20 snps
identified. addition, rs28470223 located within promoter hs3st3a1 was
associated p. falciparum parasitaemia, whereas pgmdr analysis revealed a
genetic interaction hs3st3a1 hs3st3b1. seventy-three significant
multi-locus models identified correcting multiple tests; 37
significant multi-locus models included rs28470223, whereas 38 multi-locus models
contained least one mis-sense mutation within hs3st3b1.
conclusion: genetic variants hs3st3a1 hs3st3b1 associated p.
falciparum parasitaemia. suggests variants alter the
function heparan sulphate proteoglycans p. falciparum parasitaemia.
