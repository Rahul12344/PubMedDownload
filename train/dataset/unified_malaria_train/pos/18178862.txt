cerebral malaria (cm) fatal manifestation plasmodium falciparum
infection. using murine models malaria, found much greater up-regulation of
a number chemokine mrnas, including cxcr3 ligands, the
brain fatal murine cm (fmcm) model non-cm. expression of
cxcl9 cxcl10 rna localized predominantly cerebral microvessels and
in adjacent glial cells, expression ccl5 restricted mainly to
infiltrating lymphocytes. majority mice deficient cxcr3 found to
be protected fmcm, protection associated reduction in
the number cd8+ cells brain vessels well reduced expression of
perforin fasl mrna. adoptive transfer cd8+ cells c57bl/6 mice with
fmcm abrogated protection cxcr3-/- mice. moreover, decreased
mrna levels proinflammatory cytokines ifn-gamma lymphotoxin-alpha 
the brains mice protected fmcm. data suggest role cxcr3 in
the pathogenesis fmcm recruitment activation pathogenic
cd8+ cells.
