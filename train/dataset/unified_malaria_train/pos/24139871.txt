objective: investigate influence il6, il12b vdr single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) uncomplicated plasmodium vivax infection symptoms
intensity, parasitemia gametocytemia levels brazilian amazonian
population.
methods: total 167 malaria patients infected p. vivax parasitemia
and gametocytemia levels estimated treatment. fourteen clinical symptoms
were evaluated included principal component analysis derive a
clinical symptom index. patients genotyped il6-174c>g, il12b 735t>c,
458a>g, 159a>c, vdr foki, taqi, bsmi snps taqman 5' nuclease assays. a
general linear model analysis covariance age, gender, exposure period and
infection history genetic ancestry performed investigate the
association genotypes parasitemia gametocytemia levels a
clinical symptom index.
results: higher parasitemia levels observed il6-174c carriers (p=0.02)
whereas il12b cgt haplotype carriers presented lower parasitemia levels
(p=0.008). vdr taqic/bsmia haplotype carriers showed higher gametocyte levels
than non-carriers (p=0.013). based clinical index values il6-174c>g
polymorphism associated malaria severity. il6-174c carriers
presented severe clinical index compared gg homozygotes (p=0.001).
conclusion: present study suggests il6, il12 vdr influence severity,
parasitemia gametocytemia clearance p. vivax infections, highlights
their potential role malaria immune response amazonian population.
