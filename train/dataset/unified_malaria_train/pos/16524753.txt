theileria parva-infected b cells express jagged-1 activate notch signalling
in parasite-dependent manner. es-62, filarial nematode-secreted
phosphorylcholine-containing glycoprotein, able stimulate
notch-mediated signalling parasitized cells. notch also activated a
similar extent addition exogenous il-10, occurs prior any
increase proliferation t. parva-infected b cells.
