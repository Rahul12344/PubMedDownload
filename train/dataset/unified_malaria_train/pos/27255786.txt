the endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) appears play important role in
plasmodium falciparum endothelial cell binding severe malaria (sm). despite
consistent findings elevated soluble epcr (sepcr) infectious
diseases, field studies date provided conflicting data role 
epcr sm. better define role, performed genotyping the
rs867186-g variant, associated increased sepcr levels, measured sepcr
levels two prospective studies ugandan children designed understand
immunologic genetic factors associated neurocognitive deficits sm
including 551 sm children, 71 uncomplicated malaria (um) 172 healthy
community children (cc). rs867186-gg genotype frequent cc (4.1%) 
than sm (0.6%, p = 0.002). rs867186-g variant associated increased
sepcr levels sepcr lower children sm cc (p < 0.001). among
sm children, second sm episode showed trend toward lower plasma
sepcr initial admission 6-month follow-up compared those
without repeated sm (p = 0.06 both). study findings support role for
sepcr severe malaria pathogenesis emphasize distinct role sepcr in
malaria compared infectious diseases.
