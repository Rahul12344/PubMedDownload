background: clinical observations suggest canadian-born (cb) travellers 
prone severe malaria, characterized higher parasite density the
blood, severe symptoms, cerebral malaria renal failure, than
foreign-born travellers (fb) areas malaria endemicity. was
hypothesized host cytokine chemokine responses differ significantly in
cb versus fb patients returning malaria, contributing courses of
severity. detailed understanding profiles cytokines, chemokines,
and endothelial activation may useful developing biomarkers novel
therapeutic approaches malaria.
materials methods: patient population study (n = 186) was
comprised travellers returning toronto, canada 2007 2011. the
patient blood samples' cytokine, chemokine angiopoietin concentrations were
determined using cytokine multiplex assays, elisa assays.
results: significantly higher plasma cytokine levels il-12 (p40) observed
in cb compared fb travellers, epidermal growth factor (egf) observed
to higher fb cb travellers. older travellers (55 years old greater)
with plasmodium vivax infections significantly higher mean cytokine levels
for il-6 macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) adults 
p. vivax (ages 18-55). patients p. vivax infections significantly higher
mean cytokine levels monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1), m-csf than
patients plasmodium falciparum. angiopoietin 2 (ang-2) higher for
patients infected p. falciparum p. vivax, especially comparing
just fb groups. il-12 (p40) higher fb patients p. vivax compared 
to p. falciparum. il-12 (p40) also higher patients infected p. vivax 
than infected plasmodium ovale. patients travelling west
africa, ifn-Î³ il-6 lower patients regions of
africa.
conclusion: significantly higher levels il-12 (p40) lower levels egf in
cb travellers may serve useful prognostic markers disease severity help
guide clinical management upon return. il-6 m-csf older adults mcp-1, 
il-12 (p40) m-csf p. vivax infected patients may also prove useful in
understanding age-associated species-specific host immune responses, could
the species-specific differences ang-2. regional differences host immune
response malaria infection within species may speak unique strains
circulating parts west africa.
