the atp-binding cassette transporter a1 (abca1) modulates transbilayer
distribution phosphatidylserine outer leaflet plasma membrane.
this external exposure phosphatidylserine hallmark microparticle
production impaired abca1(-/-) mice. study, report the
complete resistance cerebral malaria mice. analysis of
histological systemic parameters evidenced impairment cellular
responses plasmodium berghei anka infection abca1(-/-) mice, shown by
lower plasma tumor necrosis factor levels, weaker up-regulation endothelial 
adhesion molecules brain microvessels, reduced leukocyte sequestration, as
well ablated platelet accumulation. besides, number the
procoagulant activity microparticles dramatically reduced plasma
of abca1(-/-) compared abca1(+/+) mice. moreover, microparticles derived 
plasmodium berghei anka-infected abca1(+/+) mice induced significant increase
of tumor necrosis factor release noninfected macrophages. abca1(-/-) mice
platelet macrophage responses vesiculation agonists ablated and
reduced, respectively. altogether, pointing abca1 transporter a
major element controlling cerebral malaria susceptibility, data provide a
novel insight pathophysiological mechanisms consistent a
