the protozoan parasite theileria parva infects transforms bovine lymphocytes,
giving rise fatal lymphoproliferative condition known east coast fever.
although immune cattle mount strong cytolytic lymphocyte responses the
parasite, naive animals appear unable respond develop severe
immunopathological lesions. investigated patterns cytokine mrna
expressed 19 bulk cloned parasite-infected lymphoblast cell lines using 
multiplex pcr system. considerable variation observed cytokine
profiles lines il10 universally expressed. investigation of
cloned lines representing major bovine lymphocyte populations failed to
reveal lineage-specific pattern cytokine mrna expression could be
associated infection. nonetheless, analysis cd4+ cell clone before
and transformation parasite indicated infection alter
the pattern cytokine expression, apparent upregulation il10. these
observations raise possibility il10 derived infected cells may
influence immune responses naive cattle challenge.
