vitamin b12 binding proteins measured serum urine four
patients plasmodium falciparum renal insufficiency. results
showed patients elevated serum transcobalamin ii (tcii) levels
which decreased normal level recovery azotaemia. were
direct relationships serum tcii levels blood urea-nitrogen or
creatinine concentrations. clearance urinary excretion vitamin b12 and
tcii significantly lower patients' group normal subjects. all
these findings indicated elevated serum tcii could occur p. falciparum
patients renal insufficiency. probably caused reduction in
renal plasma flow glomerular filtration rate (gfr), secondary low or
ineffective blood volume. reduced gfr, turn, reduces tcii-b12 that
filters glomeruli, resulting decreased tcii-b12 uptake the
renal tubules, thus slows tcii degradation lysosomal enzymes. the
decreased tcii catabolism therefore prolongs tcii survival circulation
and probably stimulates tcii synthesis secretion feedback mechanism.
