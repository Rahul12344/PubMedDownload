in african endemic area, adults less vulnerable cerebral malaria than
children probably acquired partial immunity semi-immune status.
here, developed experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) model semi-immune
mice. c57bl/6 (b6) mice underwent one, two three cycles infection and
radical treatment (1-cure, 2-cure 3-cure, respectively) finally 
challenged 10(4) plasmodium berghei anka without treatment. results
showed 100% naïve (0-cure), 67% 1-cure, 37% 2-cure none of
3-cure mice succumbed ecm within 10 days post challenge infection. the
protected 3-cure mice, significantly higher levels plasma il-10 lower
levels ifn-γ others day 7 post challenge infection observed. 
major increased lymphocyte subset il-10 positive cells 3-cure mice was
cd5(-)cd19(+) b cells. passive transfer splenic cd19(+) cells 3-cure mice
protected naïve mice ecm. additionally, aged 3-cure mice also protected
from ecm 12 20 months last challenge infection. conclusion, mice
became completely resistant ecm three exposures malaria. cd19(+) b
cells determinants protective mechanism semi-immune mice ecm
possibly via modulatory il-10 pathogenic ifn-γ production.
