background: regulatory cells (tregs) subset cells play an
important role modulating effector responses infectious challenges.
the aim study evaluate possible associations regulatory
gene polymorphisms risk uncomplicated malaria control of
plasmodium falciparum parasite density levels.
methods: twelve regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) promoter
regions foxp3 (ss270137548, rs11091253), il10ra (rs56356146, rs7925112),
il10rb (rs8178433, rs8178435, rs999788), stat6 (rs3024941, rs3024943, rs3024944) 
and tnfrsf18 (ss2080581728, rs3753344) genotyped cohort congolese
children. studied subjects followed (passively) one year. the
children experienced one several clinical episodes genotyped as
"uncomplicated malaria" group (n=179) children experience
any episode genotyped "asymptomatic children" group (n=138).
results: prevalence rs3024944cc genotype stat6 significantly higher
in group asymptomatic children compared uncomplicated malaria
(p=0.003). similarly, minor allele rs3024944c prevalent group
of asymptomatic children (p=0.019). two novel snps observed including
-163t/g (ss491228441) il10ra gene -163c/t (ss491228440) tnfrsf18 gene. 
the genotype ss491228441tt minor allele ss491228441g il10ra were
more frequent group asymptomatic children (p=0.006 p=0.007,
respectively). genotype rs11091253ct foxp3 associated high
parasite density levels. addition, new promoter il10ra variant (ss491228441)
contributes shield mild malaria.
conclusion: study indicated stat6 promoter polymorphism rs3024944
was associated uncomplicated malaria, whereas foxp3 promoter variant
rs11091253 associated significant p. falciparum parasitaemia levels.
these genetic data may contribute understanding molecular mechanisms
that regulate immune response p. falciparum infections.
