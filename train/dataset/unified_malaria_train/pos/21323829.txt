our previous studies shown plasmodium berghei infection induces
distinct clinical, parasitological immunological states young susceptible 
rats versus adult resistant rats. susceptibility mainly found be
related inadequate cellular responses. study first identified the
altered genes young susceptible rats. unexpectedly, transcriptome analysis did
not reveal alteration effector cytokines receptors. day
13 p.i., six transcripts corresponding faim3, mesothelin, gas3 (pmp22), gas7, 
cd24 p2y6r significantly decreased young infected rats compared 
with adult infected rats. cd24 p2y6r participate cellular immune
responses, next evaluated role course infection. adoptive
transfer experiments showed transient robust participation cd24+ cells
in control parasitaemia. role p2y6r investigated via its
specific ability activated uridine di-phosphate (udp). young rats
treated udp partially restored expression p2y6r, controlled
parasitaemia survived thereafter. conclusion, study contributes to
the discovery novel biomarkers young susceptible rats suggests the
decrease expression could among reasons development of
severe pathology malaria.
