objective: characterize hemostasis determine disseminated intravascular
coagulation (dic) present cats cytauxzoonosis.
design: cross-sectional study.
setting: university teaching hospital.
animals: five client-owned cats cytologic pcr-confirmed cytauxzoonosis.
interventions: none.
measurements main results: admission samples collected hemostasis
testing including platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time,
prothrombin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin (at), d-dimer, protein c, plasminogen,
antiplasmin, factors vii, viii, ix, x, xi, von willebrand factor, and
thromboelastography. results compiled combined criteria used define
dic, 5 cats satisfied criteria using previously described modified
scoring system dic cats. abnormalities found 5 cats included
thrombocytopenia, low protein c activity, prolonged prothrombin time;
however, none cats low activity. none cats clinical
signs hemorrhage despite thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor deficiency (5/5 
cats), thromboelastographic evidence hypocoagulability (2/5 cats). three
of 5 cats survived hospital discharge. nonsurvivors disseminated
cytauxzoonosis schizont-laden macrophages vessels various organs.
conclusions: first report comprehensively describes the
hemostastic status cats naturally occurring infection cytauxzoon
felis. 5 cats laboratory evidence overt dic. unlike human canine
models sepsis-induced dic, deficiency found series cats.
further research warranted investigate therapeutic strategies targeting
thrombotic dic improve survival cats cytauxzoonosis.
