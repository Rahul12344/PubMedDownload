cerebral malaria (cm) primary cause malaria-associated deaths among young
african children. yet diagnostic tools available could used to
predict children infected plasmodium falciparum malaria will
progress cm. used plasmodium berghei anka murine model experimental 
cerebral malaria (ecm) high-density oligonucleotide microarray analyses to
identify host molecules strongly associated clinical symptoms
of ecm. comparative expression analyses performed c57bl/6 mice, which
have ecm-susceptible phenotype, mice ecm-resistant
phenotypes: cd8 knockout perforin knockout mice c57bl/6 background and
balb/c mice. analyses allowed identification 200 host
molecules (a majority identified previously) altered
expression patterns brain strongly associated the
manifestation ecm. among host molecules, brain samples mice with
ecm expressed significantly higher levels p21, metallothionein, hemoglobin
alpha1 proteins western blot analysis mice unaffected ecm, suggesting 
the possible utility molecules prognostic biomarkers cm humans.
we suggest higher expression hemoglobin alpha1 brain may be
associated ecm could source excess heme, molecule is
considered trigger pathogenesis cm. studies greatly enhance the
repertoire host molecules use diagnostics novel therapeutics cm.
