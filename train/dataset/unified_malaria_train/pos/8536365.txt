a major feature pathology induced theileria annulata acute
lymphocytic proliferation, study investigates mechanisms underlying 
the intrinsic ability t. annulata-infected monocytes induce naive
autologous cells proliferate. different t. annulata-infected clones
expressed different constant levels mhc class ii, varying < 1.0 x
10(5) 1.5 x 10(6) molecules/cell, measured saturation binding. however, 
no correlation found level mhc class ii expression levels 
of induced cell proliferation. theileria annulata-infected cell lines and
clones assayed cytokine mrna expression reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). infected cells assayed
produced mrna specific il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6, il-10 tumour necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-2 il-4. one clone (clone g) not
produce mrna tnf-alpha. degree cell proliferation induced by
infected cells directly correlated amount mrna produced t
cell stimulatory cytokines il-1 alpha il-6, assessed semiquantitative
technique. contrast, cells infected related parasite t. parva
produced mrna il-1 alpha, il-2, il-4, il-10 interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma).
since t. parva-infected cells also induce naive autologous cell proliferation, 
it seems likely production il-1 alpha cells infected either
parasite major signal induction non-specific cell
proliferation.
