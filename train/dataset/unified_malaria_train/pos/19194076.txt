theileria parva (t. parva) causes highly serious bovine disease called east
coast fever (ecf), characterized pyrexia, dyspnea cachexia is
of great economic importance african countries. hypothesize the
clinical symptoms ecf could explained cytokine dysregulation. 
study, investigated relationship t. parva dna load expression 
levels cytokine mrnas leukocytes experimentally infected calves by
quantitative pcr. p104 gene, encodes t. parva 104 kda
microneme-rhoptry protein, detected cattle blood day 10 t.
parva-infected tick infestation, protozoan dna load increased
together severity disease. mrna expressions pro-inflammatory
cytokines, interleukin (il)-1beta il-6, up-regulated with
protozoan dna load increasing. addition, level type-2 cytokine
(il-10) transcript also increased acute phase. contrast, the
down-regulation detectable levels expression type-1 cytokines,
such il-2 interferon (ifn)-gamma observed t. parva-infected
animals. thus, observations indicated high protozoan load resulting 
intense inflammatory responses might involved severity clinical
signs observed t. parva-infection.
