hepatic dysfunction common clinical complication malaria, although its
pathogenesis remains largely unknown. using variety vivo ex vivo
approaches, shown first time malarial infection induces
hepatic apoptosis augmentation oxidative stress. apoptosis in
hepatocyte confirmed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(tdt)-mediated dutp-biotin-nick-end labeling assay (tunel) caspase-3
activation. gene expression analysis using rt-pcr indicates significant
down-regulation bcl-2 up-regulation bax expression liver malaria 
infected mice suggesting involvement mitochondrial pathway apoptosis.
the levels fas expression caspase-8 activity infected liver same
as uninfected control mice indicating death receptor (fas) pathway did
not contribute liver apoptosis malarial infection. moreover, evidence
has presented confocal microscopy show translocation bax from
cytosol mitochondria apoptotic hepatocyte, resulting opening of
permeability transition pores, turn decreases mitochondrial membrane
potential induces cytochrome c release cytosol. malarial infection
induces generation hydroxyl radical (*oh) liver, may be
responsible induction oxidative stress apoptosis administration
of *oh specific antioxidant well spin trap, alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl-nitrone
in malaria-infected mice significantly inhibits development oxidative
stress well induction apoptosis. thus, results suggest implication
of oxidative stress induced-mitochondrial pathway apoptosis the
pathophysiology hepatic dysfunction malaria.
