babesia rossi infection causes severe inflammatory response dog, which
is result balance pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine
secretion. aim study determine whether changes cytokine
concentrations present dogs babesiosis whether associated
with disease outcome. ninety-seven dogs naturally infected b. rossi were
studied fifteen healthy dogs included controls. diagnosis of
babesiosis confirmed polymerase chain reaction reverse line blot.
blood samples collected jugular vein admission, prior any
treatment. cytokine concentrations assessed using canine-specific
multiplex assay automated analyser. serum concentrations interleukin
(il)-2, il-6, il-8, il-10, il-18, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (gm-csf) monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (mcp-1) measured. twelve 
of babesia-infected dogs died (12%) 85 survived (88%). babesia-infected
dogs also divided presented within 48 hours displaying 
clinical signs, presented 48 hours displaying
clinical signs. cytokine concentrations compared different
groups using mann-whitney u test. il-10 mcp-1 concentrations were
significantly elevated babesia-infected dogs compared healthy
controls. contrast, il-8 concentration significantly decreased 
babesia-infected dogs compared controls. concentrations il-6 mcp-1 
were significantly increased non-survivors compared survivors.
concentrations il-2, il-6, il-18 gm-csf significantly higher in
those cases presented acute stage disease. these
findings suggest mixed cytokine response present dogs with
babesiosis caused b. rossi, excessive pro-inflammatory response
may result poor outcome.
