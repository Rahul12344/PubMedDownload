it well established cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) regulatory cells (tregs) play
a crucial role course different infectious diseases. however,
contradictory results published regarding malaria infection. this
study, report specific ablation foxp3(+) tregs plasmodium
yoelii-infected dereg-balb/c mice leads increase cell activation
accompanied significant decrease parasitemia. better understand how
foxp3(+) tregs orchestrate phenotype, used microarrays analyze
cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) tregs cd4(+)cd25(-)foxp3(-) cells course p.
yoelii infection. using approach identified genes specifically
upregulated cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) tregs course infection, as
g-protein-coupled receptor 83 socs2. analysis also revealed both
cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) tregs cd4(+)cd25(-)foxp3(-) cells upregulate ctla-4, 
granzyme b, and, strikingly, il-10 acute blood infection. therefore, 
we aimed define function cell-derived il-10 context by
cre/loxp-mediated selective conditional inactivation il-10 gene t
cells. unexpectedly, il-10 ablation cells exerts minor effect on
parasite clearance, even though cd8(+) cells strongly activated, the
production ifn-γ tnf-α cd4(+)cd25(-) cells increased, the
suppressive activity cd4(+)cd25(+) tregs reduced upon infection. in
summary, results suggest cd4(+)foxp3(+) tregs modulate course of
p. yoelii infection balb/c mice. moreover, cd4(+) cell-derived il-10 affects
t effector function treg activity, limited direct effect on
parasite clearance model.
