background: glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) purified plasmodium
falciparum shown play important role toxin pathology
of malaria. previous studies demonstrated cardiac involvement patients
suffering severe malaria due p. falciparum. therefore, tested the
hypothesis gpi induces apoptosis cardiomyocytes.
methods results: using tunel caspase activity assays, provided
evidence apoptosis induction cardiomyocytes p. falciparum gpi 48 
h incubation. similar result obtained heart cells mice 48 h 
in vivo injection gpi. gene expression analyses gpi-treated cardiomyocytes 
showed up-regulation apoptotic genes (apaf-1, bax) myocardial
damage marker bnp (brain natriuretic peptide), down-regulation was
observed anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 heat shock protein hsp70. 
in spite inflammatory cytokine gene up-regulation gpi, co-culture with
peripheral mononuclear cells (pmncs) change results obtained with
cardiomyocytes alone, indicating direct effect gpi cardiac myocytes.
co-culture non-myocytic cardiac cells (nmccs) resulted up-regulation of
hsp70 bcl-2 genes gpi-treated cardiomyocytes without repercussion on
the apoptosis level. malaria-infected patient, presenting fulminant heart
failure showed typical signs cardiac myocyte apoptosis demonstrating the
clinical relevance toxin induced heart damage lethality malaria.
our studies performed vitro mice suggest gpi could be
responsible cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurred patient.
conclusion: plasmodium falciparum gpi-induced apoptosis might participate 
lethality malaria.
