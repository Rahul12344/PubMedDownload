after infection sporozoites protozoon theileria parva (tp) bovine t
cells readily transformed permanent growth vivo vitro. their
transformed state depends constant presence parasite membrane
signals remain important. non-receptor tyrosine kinases play critical role in
the transduction membrane signals haematopoietic cells. have
investigated src-family kinases bovine cells transformed tp. cell
receptor-associated tyrosine kinase p60fyn high activity cell lines
tested. addition, weak phosphorylation 2 novel bands observed
associated fyn. contrast fyn, enzymatic activity p56lck, t
cells essential role signalling, low. furthermore, 1 3 tp
transformed cell lines completely devoid p56lck indicating enzyme
is necessary tp dependent growth cells. addition to
p60fyn p56lck weak enzymatic activity 1 splice variant p53/56lyn was
observed infection cells tp. data show growth
transformation tp influences kinase activity bovine cells. however, 
also prove p56lck play essential role transformation
mechanism.
