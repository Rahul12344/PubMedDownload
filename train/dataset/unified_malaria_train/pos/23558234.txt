the present study aimed investigate oxidative stress, dna damage, and
histopathological alterations hepatic tissues mongolian gerbils
experimentally infected babesia divergens. found parasitaemia
reached approximately 77% day 5 post-infection. liver became dark-brown
and extremely friable, hepatic sinusoids dilated contained
macrophages parasite-containing erythrocytes. infection also induced
inflammation injury liver. illustrated (1) increase 
inflammatory cellular infiltrations, (2) decrease total antioxidant
capacity, indicated lowered glutathione catalase levels, (3) increased 
production nitric oxide-derived products (nitrite/nitrate) and
malondialdehyde, (4) increased lactic acid dehydrogenase activity protein
carbonyl content liver. infection also interfered normal cell
cycle hepatic tissue, indicated significant increase the
percentage liver cells g0/g1 approximately 86.2% 97.5% s
phases 0.28% 2.2%. collectively, present data suggest b.
divergens infection could induce cell-cycle alteration following oxidative stress
and dna damage hepatic tissue. work required investigate the
mechanism hepatic tissue damage takes place.
