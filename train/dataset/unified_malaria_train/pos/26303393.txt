the treatment iron deficiency areas high malaria transmission is
complicated evidence suggests iron deficiency anemia protects
against malaria, iron supplementation increases malaria risk. iron
deficiency anemia results array pathologies, including reduced systemic 
iron bioavailability abnormal erythrocyte physiology; however, mechanisms
by pathologies influence malaria infection well defined. in
the present study, response malaria infection examined mutant
mouse line, tfrc(mri24910), identified n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea (enu)
screen. line carries missense mutation gene transferrin
receptor 1 (tfr1). heterozygous mice exhibited reduced erythrocyte volume and
density, phenotype consistent dietary iron deficiency anemia. however,
unlike case dietary deficiency, erythrocyte half-life, mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, intraerythrocytic ferritin content were
unchanged. systemic iron bioavailability also unchanged, indicating this
mutation results erythrocytic iron deficiency without significantly altering
overall iron homeostasis. infected rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium chabaudi adami, mice displayed increased parasitemia succumbed 
infection quickly wild-type littermates. transfusion of
fluorescently labeled erythrocytes malaria parasite-infected mice
demonstrated erythrocyte-autonomous enhanced survival parasites within
mutant erythrocytes. together, results indicate tfr1 deficiency alters
erythrocyte physiology way similar dietary iron deficiency
anemia, albeit lesser degree, promotes intraerythrocytic
parasite survival increased susceptibility malaria mice. these
findings may implications management iron deficiency the
context malaria.
