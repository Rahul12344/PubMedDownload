mice deficient functional interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf-1-/-) by
targeted gene disruption infected lethal murine malaria strain, plasmodium
berghei anka survived longer wild-type littermates despite inability
to induce appreciable amounts interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) nitric oxide.
in addition, infected irf-1-/- mice displayed less organ injury reduced
necrosis inflammation. wild-type irf-1-/- mice treated with
exogenous interleukin-12 (il-12) suffered extensive organ damage with
corresponding regulation ifn-gamma, suggesting pathogenic potential 
il-12 ifn-gamma. il-10 cytokine produced cd4+ lymphocytes belonging
to th2 subset. expression il-10 wild-type mice correlated 
severity infection, higher mrna expression towards later stage of
infection. contrast wild-type mice, il-10 levels irf-1-/- mice
were induced early infection decreased gradually infection
progressed. untreated il-12 treated wild-type mice appeared follow 
th1-like immune response early infection th2-like immune response
later infection. however, irf-1-/- mice able launch altered
immune response th2-like immune response early infection. these
findings suggest il-10 expression irf-1-/- mice early
stage p. berghei anka infection could play important role suppressing
pathogenic effects cell mediated immune response promoting protective
immunity parasite.
