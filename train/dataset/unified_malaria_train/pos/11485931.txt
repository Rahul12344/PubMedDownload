we explored role cd40-cd40l (cd154) severe malaria elicited by
plasmodium berghei anka infection mice. mortality >90% day 8 after
infection +/+ mice, markedly decreased cd40-/- cd40l-/- mice, 
well +/+ mice treated anti-cd40l monoclonal antibody. parasitemia 
similar different conditions. breakdown blood-brain barrier was
evident infected +/+, cd40-/- mice. thrombocytopenia less
severe cd40-/- mice +/+ controls. sequestration macrophages 
brain venules alveolar capillaries reduced cd40-/- cd40l-/-
mice, whereas sequestration parasitized red blood cells polymorphonuclear
leukocytes alveolar capillaries cd40-cd40l-independent. cd40 mrna was
increased brain lung infected mice whereas cd40l increased in
the lung. tumor necrosis factor plasma levels similarly increased in
infected +/+ cd40-/- mice. expression cd54 mrna levels brain
were moderately decreased cd40-deficient mice. thus mortality associated
with severe malaria requires cd40-cd40l interaction contributes the
breakdown blood-brain barrier, macrophage sequestration, platelet
consumption.
