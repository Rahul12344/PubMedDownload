nkt cells population innate-like lymphocytes display effector
functions immunoregulatory properties. characterized nkt cell response
induced c57bl/6 mice primary infection plasmodium yoelii
sporozoites. observed heterogeneous nkt cell response differed 
liver spleen. hepatic nkt cells found infected livers consisted mainly 
cd1d-dependent cd4+ double-negative (dn) nkt cells, whereas cd1d-independent 
nkt cells exhibiting tcr(high) cd4(high) phenotype prominent among splenic
nkt cells infection. hepatic splenic nkt cells isolated from
infected mice activated secreted mainly gamma interferon tumor
necrosis factor alpha response stimulation. finally, p. yoelii-activated
hepatic dn nkt cells inhibited parasite's liver stage cd1d-dependent
manner vitro. however, experiments using b6.cd1d-deficient mice showed that
cd1d cd1d-restricted nkt cells necessary control parasite's
development vivo neither preerythrocytic stage erythrocytic
stage. thus, results show primary p. yoelii infection induces a
heterogeneous organ-specific response nkt cells cd1d-dependent
nkt cells play minor role control development plasmodium in
vivo model.
