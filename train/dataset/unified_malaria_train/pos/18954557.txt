signal transducer activator transcription (stat) proteins play an
important role cytokine signaling pathways regulation immune responses.
the balance phosphorylated (activated) stat1 (pstat1) stat3 (pstat3)
has documented cancer immunology. study, investigated the
dynamic balance pstat1 pstat3 c57bl/6 mice infected either a
nonlethal (py17xnl) lethal (py17xl) strain plasmodium yoelii. py17xnl 
and py17xl infections induced maximum activation stat1 stat3 the
first day parasite inoculation. additionally, py17xnl infection induced
a pstat1-dominant response mice early stage infection, 
resolution parasitemia. contrast, py17xl infection induced a
pstat3-dominant response early phase infection, death of
the animals. results indicated maximum activation stat1 stat3
occurred much earlier peak levels cytokines induced plasmodium
yoelii infection based previous reports infection py17xnl and
py17xl induced different dynamic patterns pstat1 pstat3 balance.
