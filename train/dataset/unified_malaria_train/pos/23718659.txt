objective: characterize systemic immune responses cytauxzoon felis-infected
cats.
sample: blood lung samples obtained 27 cats.
procedures: cats allocated 4 groups: cats died cytauxzoonosis, 
acutely ill c felis-infected cats, healthy survivors c felis infection, and
healthy uninfected cats. serum concentrations tumor necrosis factor-α and
interleukin-1 β measured serum proteins characterized. blood smears were
stained immunocytochemically used assess immunoglobulin deposition.
immunohistochemical expression cd18 tumor necrosis factor-α compared 
in lung tissues obtained cats died healthy uninfected cats. a
real-time reverse-transcription pcr assay cd18 expression performed on
selected blood samples groups.
results: concentrations cytokines greater serum albumin
concentrations significantly lower cats died cytauxzoonosis,
compared results groups. erythrocytes acutely ill cats
and survivors c felis infection staining plasmalemmal igm, whereas
erythrocytes groups not. increased staining c
felis-infected monocytes interstitial neutrophils cd18 detected. 
real-time reverse-transcription pcr assay confirmed relative increase cd18
expression cats died cytauxzoonosis acutely ill cats, compared
with expression groups. immunostaining tnf-α lung samples
confirmed local proinflammatory response.
conclusions clinical relevance: results indicated immunopathologic responses 
were greater cats died c felis infection cats survived c 
felis infection.
