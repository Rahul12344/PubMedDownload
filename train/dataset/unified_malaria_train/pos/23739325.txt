malaria, responsible one million deaths every year.
sequestration mediated specific interactions members p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family receptors the
endothelial lining. severe childhood malaria associated expression of
specific pfemp1 subtypes containing domain cassettes (dcs) 8 13 (ref. 3), but
the endothelial receptor parasites expressing proteins unknown.
here identify endothelial protein c receptor (epcr), mediates the
cytoprotective effects activated protein c, endothelial receptor for
dc8 dc13 pfemp1. show epcr binding mediated the
amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (cidrα1) dc8 group a
pfemp1 subfamilies, cidrα1 interferes protein c binding epcr.
this pfemp1 adhesive property links p. falciparum cytoadhesion host receptor
involved anticoagulation endothelial cytoprotective pathways, has
implications understanding malaria pathology development new
