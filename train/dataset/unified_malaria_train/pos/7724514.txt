erythrocytes carrying mutations spectrin protein 4.1 show differing
sensitivities invasion plasmodium falciparum.

facer ca.

the role erythrocyte skeleton invasion process plasmodium
falciparum evaluated using genetically variant erythrocytes containing
well-defined molecular defects alpha spectrin (alpha sp) protein 4.1 from
eight unrelated families. invasion red cells subjects three black
families hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (hpp) due inheritance alpha
i/74 mutant spectrin significantly reduced cells patients
and relatives carried asymptomatic hereditary
elliptocytosis (he). likewise, reduced invasion also seen red cells from
two families alpha i/65 variant spectrin present.
resistance invasion absolute sample varied 38% 
71% seen normal cells. decreased invasion correlated the
percentage spectrin dimers present within membrane variant cells. in
contrast, invasion elliptocytes three families partial
deficiency protein 4.1 (he/4.1+) normal percentage spectrin dimers
was either unchanged increased. precise mechanism molecular basis
behind reduced invasion hpp red cells bearing sp alpha domain
variants remains elucidated might relate alterations in
merozoite/red cell-receptor interactions and/or merozoite endocytosis. the
occurrence elliptocytosis spectrin defects (in particular, sp alpha i/65 
and sp alpha i/46 variants west africa) suggests mutations the
alpha sp gene could related protection malaria.
