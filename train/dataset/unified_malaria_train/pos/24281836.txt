polymerase chain reaction. western blotting used examine protein
expression multidrug resistance protein 1 (mdr1, abcb1). compared with
controls, placental mrna expression abcb1a, abcb1b, abcc1, abcc2, abcc3, and
abcg2 significantly downregulated malaria-infected group (p < 0.05), 
as placental mdr1 protein (p < 0.05). significantly decreased hepatic
expression abcc2, abcg2, abcb11 significantly increased expression 
abcb1b, abcc1, abcc3 seen malaria-infected dams (p < 0.05) in
comparison uninfected controls. expression abcb1a abcg2 was
significantly decreased fetal liver infected dams, whereas levels abcb1b
were increased (p < 0.05). maternal fetal hepatic expression cyp3a11 was
significantly downregulated malaria group (p < 0.05). together,
malaria-induced alterations expression transporters and
drug-metabolizing enzymes maternal fetal tissues may alter disposition
of endogenous therapeutic substrates, potentially impacting maternal and
fetal outcomes.
