cells involved innate adapted immunity produce cytokines capable of
orchestrating immune response babesia theileria infections. thus,
cd4-postive cells recognise peptide fragments parasites context
of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii antigen produce gamma 
interferon (ifn-gamma) activate macrophages enhanced phagocytosis and
intracellular killing parasites. addition, cd4-positive cells produce
interleukin 2 (il-2) essential clonal expansion cd8-positive 
t cells. latter cells kill theileria-infected host leucocytes mhc class
i-dependent manner. hand, overproduction proinflammatory
cytokines contributes disease progress.
