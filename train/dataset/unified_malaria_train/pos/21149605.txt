immunization cancer patients vaccines containing full-length tumor ags
aims elicit specific abs cd4(+) cd8(+) cells. vaccination 
protein ags, however, often elicits cd4(+) cell responses without inducing
ag-specific cd8(+) cells, exogenous protein primarily presented cd4(+)
t cells. recent data revealed ab-mediated targeting protein ags cell
surface receptors dendritic cells could enhance induction cd4(+)
and cd8(+) cells. investigated study observations were
applicable ny-eso-1, cancer-testis ag widely used clinical cancer vaccine
trials. generated two novel targeting proteins consisting full-length
ny-eso-1 fused c terminus two human mabs human mannose
receptor dec-205, internalizing molecules expressed apc. these
targeting proteins evaluated ability activate ny-eso-1-specific
human cd4(+) cd8(+) cells vitro. targeted ny-eso-1 proteins rapidly
bound respective targets apc. whereas nontargeted ab-targeted
ny-eso-1 proteins similarly activated cd4(+) cells, cross-presentation to
cd8(+) cells efficiently induced targeted ny-eso-1. addition,
both mannose receptor dec-205 targeting elicited specific cd4(+) cd8(+) t
cells pbls cancer patients. receptor-specific delivery ny-eso-1 apc
appears promising vaccination strategy efficiently generate integrated
and broad ag-specific immune responses ny-eso-1 cancer patients.
