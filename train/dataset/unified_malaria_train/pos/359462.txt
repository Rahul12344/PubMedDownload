changes proportions total numbers splenic thy-1.2+ cells, ig+ cells
and normoblasts analysed fatal plasmodium berghei non-fatal p.
yoelii infections mice. thy-1.2+ ig+ cells identified rosetting
techniques, normoblasts morphological criteria. splenomegaly observed 
during infections found caused mainly proliferation of
normoblasts. early increase numbers thy-1.2+ ig+ cells was
detected infections, p. berghei infections responses were
subsequently suppressed. p. yoelii infections thy-1.2+ ig+ cell numbers
were maintained four five-fold normal levels mice had
completely recovered. acute phase p. yoelii infection appeared
that splenic t-cells expressed surface immunoglobulin.
