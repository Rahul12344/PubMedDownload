placental malaria (pm) lead poor neonatal outcomes, including low
birthweight due fetal growth restriction (fgr), especially associated
with local inflammation (intervillositis iv). pathogenesis of
pm-associated fgr largely unknown, idiopathic fgr, impaired
transplacental amino acid transport, especially system group of
amino acid transporters, implicated. hypothesized pm-associated 
fgr could result impairment transplacental amino acid transport triggered
by iv. cohort malawian women infants, expression and
activity system (measured na⁺-dependent ¹⁴c-meaib uptake) reduced in
pm, especially associated iv, compared uninfected placentas. an
in vitro model pm iv, placental cells exposed monocyte/infected
erythrocytes conditioned medium showed decreased system activity. amino acid
concentrations analyzed reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography
in paired maternal cord plasmas revealed specific alterations amino acid
transport pm, especially iv. overall, data suggest the
fetoplacental unit responds pm altering placental amino acid transport 
to maintain adequate fetal growth. however, iv profoundly compromises
placental amino acid transport function, leading fgr. study offers the
first pathogenetic explanation fgr pm.
