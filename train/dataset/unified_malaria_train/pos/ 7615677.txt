the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class molecules ubiquitous cell 
surface molecules involved cell-mediated immune response. show here,
using number different, independent approaches, proteins an
essential component host cell surface receptor involved theileria parva
sporozoite invasion. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) reactive common
determinants mhc class molecules beta-2 microglobulin inhibited
sporozoite entry specifically preventing initial binding event. however,
in experiments using lymphocytes heterozygous cattle least four 
mhc class gene products expressed, mabs reacted one of
these products inhibit entry. using series bovine deletion mutant
cell lines one mhc class haplotypes lost,
sporozoite binding entry clearly correlated level class surface
expression. level sporozoite entry cells one the
mhc class haplotypes lost slightly lower parent
cells, double deletion cell line less 5% class i
expression parent cells level infection 4.3% 
the parent cells. furthermore, sporozoite entry cells spontaneously
arising mutant cell line exhibiting low levels class expression was
correspondingly low. treatment lymphocytes il-2 produced significant
increase host cell susceptibility sporozoite entry increase
correlated either increase number target molecules per host
cell, binding bovine mhc class molecules mabs. in
particular, significant increase level reactivity mab w6/32 
observed. lastly, show parasite entry competitively inhibited with
an isolated sporozoite surface protein, p67. however, p67 binds weakly to
lymphocyte surface molecules initial attempts use p67 isolate the
relevant host cell molecule(s) successful.
