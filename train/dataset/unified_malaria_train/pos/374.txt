a radioimmunoassay procedure guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cgmp) is
described. procedure based competitive binding [3h]cgmp and
non-radioactive cgmp, separation bound unbound cgmp millipore
filtration. binding reaction showed high specificity cgmp, a
broad ph optimum, reached equilibrium within short time. simple procedure
for pruification assay samples using dowex ag 50w-x2 resin also
described. cgmp contents urine samples assayed without purification.
injection glucagon healthy human volunteers resulted small but
significant reduction urinary cgmp level, whereas camp excretion increased
dramatically.
