studies demonstrated membrane attack complex (mac) complement
can evoke seizures injected directly rodent brain. course of
studies examine role complement development experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm), observed fewer seizures mice deficient c5, a
component required mac formation. determine mac contributed 
tonic-clonic seizures characteristic ecm, performed long-term
video-electroencephalography (eeg) c5(-/-) mice plasmodium berghei
anka-induced cerebral malaria observed significantly reduced spike and
seizure frequency compared wild-type mice. data suggest role mac
in malaria-induced seizures inhibition terminal complement
pathway may reduce seizures seizure-related neurocognitive deficits.
