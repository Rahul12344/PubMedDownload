background: red blood cell variants protect african children severe
falciparum malaria. however, individual interactive effects mild
disease parasite density, modification age-dependent immunity,
are poorly understood. study, address knowledge gaps a
prospective cohort study malaria risk plasmodium falciparum densities in
malian children.
methods: kenieroba innate defense study malaria (kids-malaria) a
4-year prospective cohort study children aged 6 months 17 years undertaken 
in mali 2008 2011. red blood cell variants haemoglobin (hbs), 
haemoglobin c (hbc), α thalassaemia, abo blood groups, glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency encoded x-linked a- allele. primary
outcome malaria incidence, measured number uncomplicated severe 
malaria episodes time. secondary outcome parasite density the
time malaria episode. modelled incidence rate ratios quasi-poisson
regression analysed parasite densities using generalised estimating
equations. study registered clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00669084.
findings: may 1, 2008, dec 29, 2011, enrolled 1586 children into
the study. successfully typed five red blood cell variants 1543 of
these children, therefore constituted evaluable population we
diagnosed 4091 malaria episodes 2656 child-years follow-up. 1543
children, red blood cell variants common, occurred following
frequencies: sickle cell trait (hbas) 220 (14%), hbc heterozygosity (hbac) 103
(7%), α thalassaemia 438 (28%), type blood group 621 (40%), g6pd deficiency
72 (9%) 767 boys 158 (20%) 776 girls. overall incidence malaria 
was 1.54 episodes per child-year follow-up, ranging 2.78 episodes per
child-year age 3 years 0.40 episodes per child-year age 17 years. the
malaria incidence lower hbas children hbaa children normal
haemoglobin (adjusted incidence rate ratio [airr] 0.66 [95% ci 0.59-0.75],
p<0.0001) lower g6pd a-/a- homozygous girls g6pd a+/a+ girls (0.51
[0.29-0.90], p=0.020), higher hbac children hbaa children
(1.15 [1.01-1.32], p=0.039). parasite density lower hbas children (median 
10,550 parasites per μl [iqr 1350-26,250]) hbaa children (15,150
parasites per μl [4250-31,050]; p=0.0004). hbas-associated reductions in
malaria risk parasite density greatest early childhood.
interpretation: individual interactive effects hbas, hbac, g6pd
a-/a- genotypes malaria risk parasite density define clinical cellular
correlates protection. identification molecular mechanisms of
these protective effects might uncover new targets intervention.

infectious diseases, national institutes health.
