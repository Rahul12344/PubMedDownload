babesia bovis (argentina): observations coagulation parameters, fibrinogen
catabolism fibrinolysis intact splenectomized cattle.

goodger bv, wright ig.

the results paper indicate cattle infected b. bovis (argentina)
have markedly altered activated coagulation system. degree thrombin
activation occurs due partly release thromboplastin-like substances from
lysed erythrocytes due primarily activation kallikrein babesial
proteases. produces hyperfibrinogenaemia, particularly intact cattle,
with soluble fibrin complexes constituting one-third total
fibrinogen concentration. high molecular weight non-coagulable fibrinogen-like
proteins detected terminally splenectomized cattle.
plasminogen concentration decreases splenectomized intact cattle while
low molecular weight fibrinogen degradation products easily detected. 
is suggested hypercoagulable intermediate state little fibrin
deposition occurs rather terminal disseminated intravascular coagulation.
