in vitro studies shown inhibition plasmodium falciparum blood-stage 
parasite growth antibody-dependent cellular inhibition mediated by
cooperation malaria-specific igg1 igg3, igg2, monocytes
via fcgamma receptor ii (fcgammarii). single amino acid substitution at
position 131 fcgammariia critical binding human igg subclasses.
the hypothesis fcgammariia-arg/arg131 genotype, bind to
igg2, host genetic factor protection high-density p. falciparum 
infection tested. one hundred eighty-two infants large community-based
birth cohort study western kenya selected unmatched case-control
study. results showed infants fcgammariia-arg/arg131 genotype
were significantly less likely risk high-density falciparum
infection, compared infants fcgammariia-his/arg131 genotype
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.278; 95% confidence interval, 0.123-0.627; p=.0021). this
finding supports hypothesis.
