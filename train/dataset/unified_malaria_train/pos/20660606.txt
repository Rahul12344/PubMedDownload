protein kinase c θ (pkcθ) functions core component immunological
synapse serves key protein integrated t-cell antigen receptor
(tcr)/cd28-induced signaling cascade leading t-cell activation. however, the
involvement pkcθ host-mediated immune responses pathogens been
thoroughly investigated. tested consequences pkcθ ablation host 
response infection plasmodium berghei anka (pba). found both
pkcθ(+/+) pkcθ(-/-) c57bl/6j mice susceptible infection pba.
however, despite similar parasite burden, pkcθ(+/+) mice earlier onset
of neurological signs, characteristics experimental cerebral malaria (ecm),
resulting earlier death. mice suffered early pronounced
splenomegaly concomitant increase total number cd4(+) splenic 
cells. contrast, large proportion pba-infected pkcθ(-/-) mice overcame
the acute phase characterized neurological symptoms survived longer than
pkcθ(+/+) mice. partial resistance pkcθ(-/-) mice ecm associated
with impaired production th1-type cytokines, including gamma interferon and
tumor necrosis factor alpha/lymphotoxin-α, known exacerbate symptoms
leading ecm. addition, pba infection-induced lfa-1 expression cd8(+) t
cells suppressed pkcθ-deficient cells, suggesting diminished ability
to adhere endothelial cells sequester brain microvasculature, may
explain decrease neurological symptoms. data implicate pkcθ in
cd4(+) th1(+) cd8(+) t-cell-mediated immune responses pba infection
that contribute development ecm.
