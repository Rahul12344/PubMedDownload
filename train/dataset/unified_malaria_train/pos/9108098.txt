the perturbation various glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored surface
proteins imparts profound regulatory signals macrophages, lymphocytes and
other cell types. specific contribution gpi moieties events
however unclear. study demonstrates purified gpis plasmodium
falciparum, trypanosoma brucei, leishmania mexicana origin sufficient 
initiate signal transduction added alone host cells chemically defined
agonists. gpis (10 nm-1 microm) induce rapid activation protein tyrosine
kinase (ptk) p59(hck) macrophages. minimal structural requirement ptk 
activation evolutionarily conserved core glycan sequence man alpha1-2man
alpha1-6man alpha1-4glcn1-6myo-inositol. gpi-associated diacylglycerols
independently activate calcium-independent epsilon isoform protein kinase 
c. signals collaborate regulating downstream nf-kappa b/rel-dependent
gene expression interleukin 1alpha, tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha, and
inducible synthase. alkylacyl-glycerol-containing im4 gipl l. mexicana,
however, unable activate protein kinase c inhibits tnf expression in
response agonists, establishing signaling specificity among structurally
distinct gpis. gpi alone appears sufficient mimic activities malaria
parasite extracts signaling pathway leading tnf expression. mab to
gpi blocks tnf induction parasite extracts indicating gpi necessary 
agent response. protozoal gpis closely related mammalian 
counterparts, data indicate gpis indeed constitute novel outside-in
signaling system, acting agonists second messenger substrates, and
imparting least two separate signals structurally distinct glycan 
and fatty acid domains. activities may underlie aspects pathology and
immune regulation protozoal infections.
