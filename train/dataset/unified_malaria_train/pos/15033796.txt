during plasmodium falciparum infection leading cerebral malaria, mechanisms
such cytokine generation cytoadherence parasitized red blood cells
(prbc) post-capillary venules clearly involved. demonstrated prbc 
adhesion human lung endothelial cells (hlec) upregulated tnf-alpha superfamily
genes genes related apoptosis inflammation. apoptosis confirmed by
standard techniques (annexin-v binding, genomic dna fragmentation, caspases
activation). apoptotic process involved cytoplasmic pathway death
receptor (dr-6, fas, tnf-r1) caspase 8, mitochondrial pathway
though bad caspase 9 activation. oxidative stress implicated in
apoptosis induction various pathological models. superoxide anion (o(2)*(-))
is key molecule oxidative stress pathway form peroxynitrites

malaria physiopathology still matter controversy, demonstrated that
prbc-induced apoptosis endothelial cells mediated oxidative
stress pathway. inhibition no* synthesis protected endothelial cells
suggesting deleterious role no*. addition, superoxide dismutase
mimetic, mntbap, also protected hlec prbc-induced apoptosis,
revealing role o(2)*(-) onoo(-).
