the intracellular, protozoan theileria species parasites eukaryotes 
known transform another eukaryotic cell. one consequence this
parasite-dependent transformation acquisition motile invasive
properties parasitized cells vitro metastatic dissemination in
the animal, causes east coast fever (t. parva) tropical theileriosis (t.
annulata). motile invasive properties infected host cells are
enabled parasite-dependent, poorly understood f-actin dynamics control
host cell membrane protrusions. herein, dissected functional structural
alterations cause acquired motility invasiveness t. annulata-infected
cells, understand molecular basis driving cell dissemination tropical
theileriosis. found chronic induction tnfα parasite contributes
to motility invasiveness parasitized host cells. show tnfα so
by specifically targeting expression function host proto-oncogenic
ser/thr kinase map4k4. blocking either tnfα secretion map4k4 expression
dampens formation polar, f-actin-rich invasion structures impairs cell
motility 3d. identified f-actin binding erm family proteins map4k4
downstream effectors process tnfα-induced erm activation cell
invasiveness sensitive map4k4 depletion. map4k4 expression infected
cells induced tnfα-jnk signalling maintained inhibition of
translational repression, whereby effects parasite dependent. thus,
parasite-induced tnfα promotes invasive motility infected cells the
activation map4k4, evolutionary conserved kinase controls cytoskeleton
dynamics cell motility. hence, map4k4 couples inflammatory signaling to
morphodynamic processes cell motility, process exploited the
intracellular theileria parasite increase host cell's dissemination
capabilities.
