the pathophysiological impact infections chloroquine-susceptible (cqs)
and chloroquine-resistant (cqr) strains plasmodium berghei mastomys
natalensis studied respect changes polyamine profiles various
tissues. cqs cqr infections produced similar changes polyamine
profiles various tissues. maximum increase recorded spleen followed 
liver lungs. renal, cardiac cerebral tissues register significant
changes. increase spermidine level prominent compared to
putrescine spermine, leading overall increase spermidine/spermine
ratio. ratio important index cellular proliferation. liver 
show considerable change activities ornithine decarboxylase and
s-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase, regulatory enzymes polyamine
biosynthetic pathway. spleen however, registered marked induction the
enzymes prominent cqs infection cqr. normal
erythrocytes contained traces polyamine erythrocytes loaded p. 
berghei parasites exhibited appreciably higher polyamine levels. spermidine was
detected five-fold higher concentrations putrescine spermine
which detected equimolar levels. again, cqs well cqr p. berghei,
exhibited qualitatively quantitatively similar polyamine profiles thus ruling
out role polyamines cq-resistance malaria.
