the protozoan parasite theileria inhabits host cell cytoplasm possesses
the unique capacity transform cells infects, inducing continuous
proliferation protection apoptosis. transforming schizont a
multinucleated syncytium resides free host cell cytoplasm is
strictly intracellular. maintain transformation, crucial this
syncytium divided two daughter cells host cell cytokinesis.
this process dissected using different cell cycle synchronization methods 
combination targeted application specific inhibitors. found that
theileria schizonts associate newly formed host cell microtubules that
emanate spindle poles, positioning parasite equatorial region
of mitotic cell host cell chromosomes assemble metaphase. during
anaphase, schizont interacts closely host cell central spindle. part 
of process, schizont recruits host cell mitotic kinase, polo-like
kinase 1, established parasite association host cell central
spindles requires polo-like kinase 1 catalytic activity. blocking interaction
between schizont astral well central spindle microtubules prevented
parasite segregation daughter cells cytokinesis. findings 
provide striking example intracellular eukaryotic pathogen that
evolved ways induce uncontrolled proliferation cells infects
usurps host cell mitotic machinery, including polo-like kinase 1, one 
pivotal mitotic kinases, ensure persistence survival.
