background: cerebral malaria form human malaria wherein plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells adhere blood capillaries brain,
potentially leading coma death. interactions parasite host
proteins important understanding pathogenesis deadly form of
malaria. is, therefore, necessary study available protein-protein
interactions identify lesser known interactions could throw light key 
events cerebral malaria.
methods: sequestration, haemostasis dysfunction, systemic inflammation and
neuronal damage key processes cerebral malaria. key events identified
from literature crucial processes. integrated interactome
was created using available experimental predicted datasets well from
literature. interactions interactome filtered based gene
ontology tissue-specific annotations, analysed relevance to
the key events.
results: pfemp1 presentation, platelet activation astrocyte dysfunction 
identified key events influencing disease. 48896 host-parasite along
with host-parasite, host-host parasite-parasite protein-protein
interactions obtained disease-specific corpus combined form an
integrated interactome. filtering interactome resulted five
host-parasite ppi, six parasite-parasite two host-host ppi. analysis of
these interactions revealed potential significance apolipoproteins and
temperature/hsp expression efficient pfemp1 presentation; role msp-1 in
platelet activation; effect parasite proteins tgf-beta regulation the
role albumin astrocyte dysfunction.
conclusions: work links key host-parasite, parasite-parasite host-host
protein-protein interactions key processes cerebral malaria generates
hypotheses disease pathogenesis based filtered interaction dataset.
these hypotheses provide novel significant insights cerebral malaria.
