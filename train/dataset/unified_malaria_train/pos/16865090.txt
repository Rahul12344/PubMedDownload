cerebral malaria (cm) life-threatening disorder major medical problem 
in developing countries. caused sequestration malaria-infected
erythrocytes onto brain endothelia, followed blood-brain barrier (bbb) damage 
and neurological deficit. present study, matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) 
were analysed mouse model cm plasmodium berghei anka. increased
numbers gelatinase b (mmp-9)-positive cells, also cd11b(+), were
detected brain. addition, activation gelatinase b occurred cm
brains, brains mice non-cm. however, selective genetic
knockout gelatinase b alter clinical evolution experimental cm.
to study protease balances, mrna expression levels nine matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps), five membrane-type mmps, tnf-alpha converting enzyme
(tace) four tissue inhibitors metalloproteinases (timps) analysed
during cm different organs. significant alterations expression were
observed, including increases mrnas mmp-3, -8, -13 -14 the
spleen, mmp-8, -12, -13 -14 liver mmp-8 -13 brain. net 
gelatinolytic activity, independent gelatinase b inhibitable edta,
was detected situ endothelia blood vessels cm brains, 
brains mice non-cm, suggesting metalloproteases, different from
gelatinase b, active bbb environment cm. increase mmp
expression brain significantly less pronounced infection of
c57bl/6 mice noncerebral strain p. berghei nk65, similar in
cm-susceptible c57bl/6 cm-resistant balb/c mice upon infection p.
berghei anka. furthermore, comparison c57bl/6 mice, larger increase 
timp-1 marked, >30-fold induction mmp-3 found brains of
balb/c mice, suggesting possible protective roles timp-1 mmp-3.
