plasmodium falciparum obligate intracellular pathogen responsible for
worldwide morbidity mortality. parasite establishes parasitophorous
vacuole within infected red blood cells wherein differentiates multiple
daughter cells must rupture host cells continue another infectious 
cycle. using atomic force microscopy, establish progressive
macrostructural changes occur host cell cytoskeleton last 15 h 
of erythrocytic life cycle. used comparative proteomics approach to
determine changes membrane proteome infected red blood cells the
final steps parasite development lead egress. mass spectrometry-based 
analysis comparing red blood cell membrane proteome uninfected red blood
cells infected red blood cells postrupture vesicles highlighted
two temporally distinct events; (hay, s. i., et al. (2009). world malaria map: 
plasmodium falciparum endemicity 2007. plos med. 6, e1000048) striking
loss cytoskeletal adaptor proteins part junctional complex,
including α/β-adducin tropomyosin, correlating temporally emergence 
of large holes cytoskeleton seen afm early ~35 h postinvasion, and
(maier, a. g., et al. (2008) exported proteins required virulence and
rigidity plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. cell 134, 48-61)
large-scale proteolysis cytoskeleton rupture ~48 h postinvasion,
mediated host calpain-1. thus propose sequential mechanism whereby
parasites first remove selected set cytoskeletal adaptor proteins weaken 
the host membrane use host calpain-1 dismantle remaining
cytoskeleton, leading red blood cell membrane collapse parasite release.
