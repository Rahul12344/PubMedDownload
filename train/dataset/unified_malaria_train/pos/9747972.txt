theileria parasitises bovine leukocytes transforms proliferating,
metastatic tumours, infection resembles leukaemia-like disease. we
have studied signal transduction pathways leading activation the
transcription factor ap-1 different transformed leukocytes. parasite infection
leads up-regulation members jun/fos family proteins and
surprisingly, occurs absence detectable erk, p38 map kinase
activity. parasitised b-sarcoma tbl3, ap-1 induction occurs absence
of jnk activity. contrast, infected macrophage b-cell lines, ap-1
transcriptional activity strictly associated parasite-induced
constitutive activation jnk subsequent c-jun n-terminal phosphorylation.
thus, constant ap-1 transcriptional activity involves upregulation the
levels jun fos proteins constitutive jnk activation.
