further pathophysiological studies hypotensive shock syndrome associated
with acute babesia bovis infection cattle demonstrated changes the
plasma concentrations conglutinin, complement c3, fibronectin and
immunoconglutinin. decreases first three components presumably due 
their contribution towards intravascular sludging infected erythrocytes within
the microvascular system acute phase infection. contrast, the
increase fibronectin immunoconglutinin recovery phase suggests 
involvement proteins reticulo-endothelial clearance infected
or damaged erythrocytes, immune complexes cryofibrinogen.
