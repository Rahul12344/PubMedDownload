eliminating malaria parasites asymptomatic obligate liver stages
(lss) infection would stop disease subsequent transmission. unfortunately,
only single licensed drug targets lss, primaquine, available.
targeting host proteins might significantly expand repertoire prophylactic
drugs malaria. here, demonstrate bcl-2 inhibitors p53
agonists dramatically reduce ls burden mouse malaria model vitro in
vivo altering activity key hepatocyte factors parasite
relies. bcl-2 inhibitors act primarily inducing apoptosis infected
hepatocytes, whereas p53 agonists eliminate parasites apoptosis-independent
fashion. combination, bcl-2 inhibitors p53 agonists act synergistically to
delay, cases completely prevent, onset blood stage disease.
both families drugs highly effective doses cause
substantial hepatocyte cell death vitro liver damage vivo. p53 agonists 
and bcl-2 inhibitors also effective administered humanized mice
infected plasmodium falciparum. data demonstrate host-based
prophylaxis could developed effective intervention strategy that
eliminates ls parasites onset clinical disease thus opens new
avenue prevent malaria.
