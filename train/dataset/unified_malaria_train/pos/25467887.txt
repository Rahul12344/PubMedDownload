cytauxzoonosis hemoprotozoal disease cats wild felids south
and southeastern united states caused cytauxzoon felis. although causative
agent recognized since seventies, study examined local
immune response affected organs, lung, compared the
lungs uninfected domestic cats. previous studies suggested the
histopathologic findings lungs c. felis-infected cats caused the
release pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokines increased production
of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), infected macrophages. our
laboratory previously found upregulation adhesion molecule cd18,
which stimulate release pro-inflammatory mediators. the
objective study characterize local pulmonary immune responses in
cats naturally infected c. felis. immunohistochemistry performed to
detect tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), interleukin (il)-1β, il-6, inos, and
major histocompatibility complex (mhc) ii 19 lungs affected cats that
died 2005 2013. results showed increased expression these
molecules compared lungs uninfected, healthy cats. furthermore, mhc 
ii expressed endothelium c. felis naturally infected cats. these
results support marked, local, pro-inflammatory immune response
that contribute pathogenesis cytauxzoonosis lungs.
