background: contribution pro-inflammatory cytokines pathogenesis of
malarial anemia studied extensively roles th2 cytokines
remain unknown. here, investigated role signal transducer activator
of transcription (stat)6-mediated responses erythropoietic suppression 
acute malaria infection mice.
design methods: na√Øve and/or erythropoietin-treated wild-type stat6(-/-) 
mice infected plasmodium chabaudi (p. chabaudi), effects
parasitemia, hematologic parameters, erythropoietin receptor, ter119, cd71
expression, vitro erythropoietin-stimulated proliferation splenic erythroid
precursors, serum cytokine levels analyzed. explore role of
interleukin-4 stat6-dependent erythropoietic suppression, mice treated in
vivo monoclonal antibody interleukin-4 effects parasitemia, 
hematologic parameters, cytokine levels analyzed.
results: infected stat6(-/-) mice developed enhanced reticulocytosis compared 
wild-type mice despite higher parasitemia similar course anemia.
enhanced reticulocytosis infected stat6(-/-) mice associated an
increased frequency late-stage erythroblasts, fewer leukocytes expressing
cd71, increased erythropoietin-stimulated proliferation splenocytes
compared infected wild-type mice. interleukin-4-depleted wild-type mice had
increased levels parasitemia course reticulocytosis similar to
responses observed infected stat6(-/-) mice. determination serum cytokine
levels stat6(-/-) wild-type mice depleted interleukin-4 treatment
with mab revealed significantly lower levels interferon-gamma compared to
control wild-type mice infection.
conclusions: together, findings provide evidence stat6-dependent
mechanism mediating erythropoietic suppression acute blood-stage
malaria indicate role interleukin-4 possibly interferon-gammain
stat6-induced erythropoietic suppression.
