naturally acquired immunity malaria develops slowly, requiring several years
of repeated exposure effective. cellular molecular factors
underlying observation partially understood. recent studies suggest
that chronic plasmodium falciparum exposure may induce functional exhaustion of
lymphocytes, potentially impeding optimal control infection. however, it
remains unclear whether "atypical" memory b cells (mbcs) "exhausted" cd4 
t cells described humans exposed endemic malaria driven p.
falciparum per se factors commonly associated malaria, as
coinfections malnutrition. address critical question took
advantage "natural" experiment near kilifi, kenya, compared profiles 
b cells children living rural community p. falciparum
transmission ongoing profiles age-matched children living under
similar conditions nearby community p. falciparum transmission ceased 
5 prior study. found continuous exposure p. falciparum
drives expansion atypical mbcs. persistent p. falciparum exposure was
associated increased frequency cd4 cells expressing phenotypic
markers exhaustion, programmed cell death-1 (pd-1) alone pd-1 in
combination lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (lag-3). expansion of
pd-1-expressing pd-1/lag-3-coexpressing cd4 cells largely confined to
cd45ra(+) cd4 cells. percentage cd45ra(+)cd27(+) cd4 cells
coexpressing pd-1 lag-3 inversely correlated frequencies of
activated classical mbcs. taken together, results suggest p.
falciparum infection per se drives expansion atypical mbcs and
phenotypically exhausted cd4 cells, reported endemic
areas.
