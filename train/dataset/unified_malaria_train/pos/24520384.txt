background: acute malarial anemia remains major public health problem.
hepcidin, major hormone controlling availability iron, raised
during acute asymptomatic parasitemia. understanding role mechanism
of raised hepcidin reduced iron availability infection critical 
to establish evidence-based guidelines management malaria anemia. our
recent clinical evidence suggests potential role il-10 regulation 
hepcidin patients acute p. falciparum malaria.
methods: measured secretion hepcidin primary macrophages the
hepatoma cell line hepg2 stimulated il-10, il-6 plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
findings: observed il-10 il-6 production increased primary
macrophages cells co-cultured plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes. found il-10 induced hepcidin secretion primary
macrophages dose-dependent manner hepg2 cells. effects were
mediated signal transducer activator transcription (stat)
3-phosphorylation completely abrogated specific stat3 inhibitor.
conclusion: il-10 directly regulate hepcidin primary macrophages not
in hepg2 cells. effect modulated plasmodium falciparum. the
results consistent role il-10 modulating iron metabolism during
acute phase infection.
