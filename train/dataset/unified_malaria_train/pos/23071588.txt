background: understanding induction immune regulatory cells upon helminth 
infection important understanding control autoimmunity allergic
inflammation helminth infection. babesia microti, intraerythrocytic
protozoan genus babesia, major cause emerging human disease
babesiosis, asymptomatic malaria-like disease. examined influence of
acute b. microti infection development regulatory b cells together with
regulatory cells.
principal findings: data demonstrate b cells stimulated vitro b.
microti produce interleukin (il)-10. cytokine also secreted b cells
isolated b. microti-infected mice response lipopolysaccharide
stimulation. addition, high levels il-10 detected serum mice
after infection b. microti. frequency il-10-producing
cd1d(high)cd5(+) regulatory b cells (bregs) cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) cells
increased course b. microti infection. furthermore, adoptive
transfer il-10-producing b cells induced b. microti infection led to
increased susceptibility recipient mice infection b. microti. in
contrast, experiments b cell-deficient (Âµmt) mice demonstrated lack 
b cells enhances susceptibility b. microti infection.
conclusions: study first demonstration expansion bregs
following infection intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite. data
suggest b. microti infection mice provides excellent model for
studying breg-mediated immune responses begins elucidate mechanism 
which helminth infection regulates autoimmunity allergic inflammation.
