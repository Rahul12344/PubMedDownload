evidence accumulating mirnas critically implicated outcome 
diseases, little information available infectious diseases. study
investigates hepatic mirna signature female c57bl/6 mice infected with
self-healing plasmodium chabaudi malaria. primary infections result in
approximately 50% peak parasitemia day 8 p.i., approximately 80% survival, and
development protective immunity. latter evidenced 100% survival 
1.5% peak parasitemia upon homolog re-infections mice still
alive day 56 primary infection. immune mice exhibit increased
levels igg2a igg2b isotypes still contain p. chabaudi-infected
erythrocytes livers revealed light microscopy pcr analysis.
primary infections, secondary infections, induce upregulation of
hepatic mrnas encoding il-1β, tnfα, ifnγ, nf-κb, inos, downregulation
of mrnas cyp7a1 sult2a2, respectively. using mirxplore microarrays
containing 634 mouse mirnas combination quantitative rt-pcr, liver is
found respond primary infections upregulation three mirna
species mir-26b, mcmv-mir-m23-1-5p, mir-1274a, downregulation 16
mirna species mir-101b, let-7a, let-7g, mir-193a-3p, mir-192, mir-142-5p,
mir-465d, mir-677, mir-98, mir-694, mir-374(*), mir-450b-5p, mir-464, mir-377,
mir-20a(*), mir-466d-3p, respectively. surprisingly, pattern
of mirna expression revealed immune mice, pattern even
sustained upon homolog re-infections immune mice. data suggest that
development protective immunity malarial blood stages p. chabaudi
is associated reprogramming expression distinct mirna species in
the female mouse liver.
