erythrocytic lipid peroxidation, activities antioxidant enzymes and
osmotic fragility red blood cells studied adult (>1 year) crossbred
cattle naturally infected theileria annulata. twenty clinically healthy
animals (group i) 15 clinical cases (group ii) tropical theileriosis 
selected. cattle suffering theileriosis significantly higher (p<0.01)
erythrocytic lipid peroxidation osmotic fragility. activities antioxidant 
enzymes, viz. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) glutamate peroxidase
(gpx) also significantly increased (p<0.01) group ii. however, superoxide
dismutase catalase show significant changes. results indicated
that infection theileria led increased oxidative stress animals,
and even significant rise activities antioxidant enzymes. g6pd and
gpx could lower oxidative stress. however, increase the
activities antioxidant enzymes pointed towards body's defence mechanism
against lipid peroxidation oxidative stress theileriosis.
