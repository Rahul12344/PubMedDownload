during placental malaria, plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes sequester
in placenta, causing health problems mother fetus. the
specific adherence mediated var2csa protein, binds placental
chondroitin sulfate (cs) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (cspgs) the
placental syncytium. however, identity cspg core protein the
cellular impact interaction remain elusive. study we
identified specific cspg core protein cs attached, and
characterized exact placental location. var2csa pull-down experiments using
placental extracts whole placenta syncytiotrophoblast microvillous cell
membranes showed three distinct cspgs available var2csa adherence. further
examination three cspgs immunofluorescence proximity ligation
assays showed syndecan-1 main receptor var2csa mediated placental
adherence. show commonly used placental choriocarcinoma cell 
line, bewo, express different set proteoglycans present on
placental syncytiotrophoblast may biologically relevant model
to study placental malaria. syncytial fusion bewo cells, triggered by
forskolin treatment, caused increased expression placental cs-modified
syndecan-1. line this, show rvar2 binding placental cs impairs
syndecan-1-related src signaling forskolin treated bewo cells, in
untreated cells.
