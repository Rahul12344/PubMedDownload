plasmodium falciparum infection result severe disease associated
with elevated inflammation vital organ dysfunction; however, malaria-endemic 
residents gain protection lethal outcomes manifest mild symptoms
during infection. characterize host responses associated more
effective antimalarial response, characterized whole-blood transcriptional
profiles rwandan adults mild malaria episode compared with
findings convalescence sample. observed transcriptional up-regulation
in many pathways, including type interferon, interferon γ, complement
activation, nitric oxide malaria infection, provide benchmarks
of mild disease physiology. transcripts encoding negative regulators t-cell
activation, programmed death ligand 1 (pd-l1), programmed death 1 ligand 
2 (pd-l2), butyrophilin family member butyrophilin-like 2 (btnl2) were
also increased. support important functional role btnl2 malaria 
infection, studied chimeric mice reconstituted btnl2(-/-) wild-type
hematopoietic cells inoculated plasmodium berghei anka, murine
model cerebral malaria. found btnl2(-/-) chimeric mice a
significant decrease survival compared wild-type counterparts.
collectively data characterize immune responses associated mild
malaria uncover novel role btnl2 host response malaria.
