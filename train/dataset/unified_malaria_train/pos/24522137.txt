interleukin-27 (il-27) pleiotropic role either pro-inflammatory or
anti-inflammatory cytokine inflammatory related diseases. role and
involvement il-27 malaria investigated effects of
modulating release production major inflammatory cytokines 
histopathological consequences major affected organs infection were
evaluated. results showed il-27 concentration significantly elevated
throughout infection positive correlation parasitaemia
development observed. augmentation il-27 significantly elevated release of
anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10 whereas antagonising neutralising il-27
produced opposite. significant elevation pro-inflammatory cytokines
(ifn-Î³ il-6) also observed, augmentation inhibition of
il-27. thus, suggested il-27 exerts anti-inflammatory activity in
the th1 type response signalling production il-10 malaria.
histopathological examination showed sequestration prbc the
microvasculature major organs malarial mice. significant
histopathological changes include hyperplasia hypertrophy kupffer
cells liver, hyaline membrane formation lung tissue, enlargement the
white red pulp followed disappearance germinal centre the
spleen, tubular vacuolation kidney tissues. conclusion, is
suggested il-27 may possibly acts anti-inflammatory cytokine during
the infection. modulation release produced positive impact on
inflammatory cytokine production infection, suggesting potential
in malaria immunotherapy, host may benefit inhibition.
