plasmodium falciparum infection results severe malaria humans, affecting
various organs, including liver, spleen brain, resulting high
morbidity mortality. plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection mice
closely recapitulates many aspects human cerebral malaria (cm); thus, this
model used investigate pathogenesis cm. suppressor cytokine
signaling 2 (socs2), intracellular protein induced cytokines hormones, 
modulates immune response, neural development, neurogenesis neurotrophic 
pathways. however, role socs2 cm remains unknown. socs2 knockout
(socs2(-/-)) mice infected pba show initial resistance infection 
reduced parasitemia production tnf, tgf-β, il-12 il-17 brain.
interestingly, late phase infection, socs2(-/-) mice display increased 
parasitemia reduced treg cell infiltration, associated enhanced levels
of th1 th17 cells related cytokines il-17, il-6, tgf-β brain. 
a significant reduction protective neurotrophic factors, glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(bdnf), also observed. moreover, molecular alterations brain of
infected socs2(-/-) mice associated anxiety-related behaviors and
cognition impairment. mechanistically, results revealed enhanced nitric
oxide (no) production pba-infected socs2(-/-) mice, inhibition no
synthesis l-name led marked decrease survival, disruption 
parasitemia control pronounced anxiety-like behavior. treatment with
l-name also shifted levels th1, th7 treg cells brains of
infected socs2(-/-) mice background levels observed infected wt, with
remarkable exception increased cd8(+)ifn(+) cells inflammatory
monocytes. results indicate socs2 plays dual role pba
infection, detrimental control parasite replication but
crucial regulation immune response production neurotrophic
factors. here, provided strong evidence critical relationship between
socs2 orchestration immune response development cm
during pba infection.
