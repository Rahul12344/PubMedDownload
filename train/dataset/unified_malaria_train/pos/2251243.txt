the role calcium invasion human erythrocyte parasite
plasmodium falciparum studied. intraerythrocytic intraparasitic
concentrations ca2+ modified using calcium-ionophore a23187 the
chelator egta. ca2+ inside parasite appeared necessary the
normal completion invasion. determined recently invaded
erythrocytes (2 h), ca2+ concentration increased 10 times. merozoite
invasion produced decrease beta-spectrin phosphorylation increase 
the phosphorylation protein band 4.1 mobility. changes were
similar produced ionophore-mediated ca2+ influx uninfected
erythrocytes. facts support idea calcium influx into
erythrocytes might precede accompany merozoite invasion, triggering series
of molecular events, including phosphorylation dephosphorylation of
cystoskeletal proteins.
