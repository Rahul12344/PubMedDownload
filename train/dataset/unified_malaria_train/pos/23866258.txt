background: rapid initiation anti-malarial treatment prevention of
complications, early diagnosis risk stratification important patients
with plasmodium falciparum malaria. routine laboratory values correlate
well disease severity. aim study determine diagnostic
and prognostic value several biomarkers related inflammation; endothelial
and cardiac dysfunction; coagulation, haemolysis imported p. falciparum
malaria.
methods: prospective case-control study, 79 adult travellers both
uncomplicated complicated p. falciparum malaria included 2007
and 2011. forty-one healthy subjects included controls. blood samples
were obtained within 24 hours first consultation assess routine
laboratory values well markers related inflammation (papp-a, copeptin,
crp), endothelial activation (mpo, elastase-2, endothelin-1, sicam-1, svcam-1),
cardiac function (nt-probnp, mr-proanp), coagulation (fibrinogen, d-dimers,
platelet count), haemolysis (ldh). prognostic performance assessed using 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (area curve = auroc).
results: twelve (15.2%) patients severe p. falciparum malaria. patient
group, significant thrombocytopaenia found, markers papp-a were
significantly elevated. diagnostic performance best crp auroc 
1.00, followed mpo (0.99), d-dimers (0.98), elastase-2 (0.98), sicam-1
(0.98). biomarker levels correlate well disease severity.
conclusion: combination travel history, fever prior blood sampling, and
crp serum levels 10.8 mg/l upon hospital admission, best
discriminated malaria patients control persons. none the
biomarkers studied predicted presence development malaria
complications, neither time admission, hospitalization.
