genome-wide searches loci involved human resistance malaria are
currently conducted large scale africa using case-control studies. 
here, explore utility alternative approach-"environmental
correlation analysis, eca," tests clines allele frequencies across a
gradient environmental selection pressure-to identify genes have
historically protected death malaria. collected genotype data
from 12,425 newborns 57 candidate malaria resistance loci 9,756 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) selected random across genome, and
examined allele frequencies geographic correlations long-term
malaria prevalence data based 84,042 individuals living different
historical selection pressures malaria coastal kenya. none 57
candidate snps showed significant (p < 0.05) correlations allele frequency
with local malaria transmission intensity adjusting population
structure multiple testing. contrast, two random snps had
highly significant correlations (p < 0.01) genes previously linked to
malaria resistance, namely, cdh13, encoding cadherin 13, hs3st3b1, encoding
heparan sulfate 3-o-sulfotransferase 3b1. proteins play role in
glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell adhesion widely implicated in
cerebral malaria, life-threatening form disease. top
genes, including ctnnd2 encodes δ-catenin, molecular partner cadherin,
were significantly enriched cadherin-mediated pathways affecting inflammation 
of brain vascular endothelium. results demonstrate utility eca
in discovery novel genes pathways affecting infectious disease.
