genetic variations toll-like receptors cytokine genes innate immune
pathways implicated controlling parasite growth pathogenesis
of plasmodium falciparum mediated malaria. previously published genetic
association tlr4 non-synonymous tnf-α promoter polymorphisms with
p.falciparum blood infection level extend study considerably by
(i) investigating genetic dependence parasite-load interleukin-12b
polymorphisms, (ii) reconstructing gene-gene interactions among candidate tlrs
and cytokine loci, (iii) exploring genetic functional impact epistatic
models (iv) providing mechanistic insights functionality of
disease-associated regulatory polymorphisms. data revealed carriage of
