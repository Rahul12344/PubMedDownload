guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (gefs) stimulate intrinsic gdp/gtp
exchange activity ras promote formation active ras-gtp, in
turn controls diverse signalling networks important regulation cell
proliferation, survival, differentiation, vesicular trafficking, gene
expression. rasgef1b gef, whose expression induced macrophages on
stimulation toll-like receptor (tlr) agonists. here, showed vitro
rasgef1b expression macrophages mostly induced tlr3 (poly i:c) tlr4 
(lipopolysaccharyde) myd88-independent pathway. vivo infection
with protozoan parasites trypanosoma cruzi plasmodium chabaudi induced
rasgef1b myd88-, trif-, ifn-gamma-dependent manner. ectopically
expressed rasgef1b found, mostly, heavy membrane fraction hek 293t,
and confocal microscopy, found located early endosomes.
computational modelling rasgef1b-ras interaction revealed rasgef1b
interacts binding domain site ras, critical region interacting 
with gefs involved activation ras-raf-mek-erk pathway. important, 
rasgef1b found closely associated ras live cells trigger
ras activity. altogether, results indicate tlr activation, rasgef1b
may trigger ras-like proteins regulate specific biological activities
described subtype gtpases.
