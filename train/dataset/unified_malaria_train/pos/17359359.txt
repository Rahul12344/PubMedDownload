disruption axonal transport may represent final common pathway leading to
neurological dysfunction cerebral malaria (cm). calpains calcium
(ca2+)-activated cysteine proteases implicated axonal injury
in neurological diseases various aetiologies. study examined the
association mu- m-calpain, specific inhibitor calpastatin, and
axonal injury post mortem brain tissue patients died severe
malaria. calpains associated axons labelled beta-amyloid
precursor protein detects impaired axonal transport. elevated levels of
calpastatin rarely observed injured axons. increased numbers
of neurones mu-calpain nuclear compartment severe malaria cases
compared non-neurological controls, increased numbers glia with
nuclear mu-calpain cm patients compared non-cm malaria cases and
non-neurological controls. marked redistribution calpastatin 
sequestered plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. responses specific to
malaria infection ascertained following analysis brain samples fatal
cases acute axonal injury, hiv encephalitis, progressive multifocal
leucoencephalopathy. findings implicate role calpains modulation
of disease progression cm.
