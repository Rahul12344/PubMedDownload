the pathogenesis cerebral malaria (cm) includes compromised microvascular
perfusion, increased inflammation, cytoadhesion, endothelial activation.
these events cause blood-brain barrier disruption neuropathology and
associations vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signaling pathway
have shown. studied pathway mice infected plasmodium berghei
anka causing murine cm without use erythropoietin (epo) adjunct
therapy. elisa western blotting used quantification vegf and
relevant proteins brain plasma. cm increased levels vegf brain and
plasma decreased plasma levels soluble vegf receptor 2. epo treatment
normalized vegf receptor 2 levels reduced brain vegf levels.
hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1α significantly upregulated whereas cerebral 
hif-2α epo levels remained unchanged. furthermore, noticed increased
caspase-3 calpain activity terminally ill mice, measured by
protease-specific cleavage α-spectrin p35. conclusion, detected
increased cerebral systemic vegf well hif-1α, brain were
reduced normal epo-treated mice. also caspase calpain activity was
reduced markedly epo-treated mice.
