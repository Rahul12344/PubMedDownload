background: vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) taken parasitized 
red blood cells malaria stimulates intra-erythrocytic growth of
plasmodium falciparum vitro. cause consequence uptake not
understood.
methods: plasmodium falciparum cultured vitro. parasite growth and
intracellular vegf levels assessed using flow cytometry. intracellular vegf 
was visualized fluorescence immunocytochemistry. phosphorylated tyrosine was
measured western blotting. vivo assessment intra-erythrocytic vegf was
performed plasmodium berghei anka-infected c57bl/6 mice.
results: vegf accumulated intracellularly infected red blood cells,
particularly schizonts. vitro growth p. falciparum unchanged when
co-cultured anti-vegf antibody bevacizumab anti-vegf
receptor-1 peptide. contrast, vegf receptor-2 inhibitor, su5416,
dose-dependently inhibited growth. none treatments reduced intracellular
vegf levels. thus, anti-parasitic effect su5416 seemed independent vegf
uptake. su5416 reduced phosphorylated tyrosine parasitized red blood cells.
similarly, broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein
dose-dependently inhibited p. falciparum growth reduced tyrosine
phosphorylation. neither bevacizumab anti-vegf receptor-1 peptide affected
tyrosine kinase activity. finally, vivo uptake vegf p. berghei anka 
demonstrated, analogous vitro uptake p. falciparum, making a
possible model effects vegf signalling vivo malaria.
conclusions: inhibition vegfr-2 signalling reduces intra-erythrocytic growth
of p. falciparum, likely due tyrosine kinase inhibition. internalisation of
vegf p. falciparum-infected red blood cells rely vegf receptors.
the function vivo uptake vegf studied rodent malaria models.
