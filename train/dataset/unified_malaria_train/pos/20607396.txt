the infection protozoan parasite theileria annulata induces changes
triggering activation and/or proliferation host lymphocytes. order 
to find possible correlations among peripheral circulatory lymphocytes,
cytokine activities level sialic acids, 50 dairy holstein cattle,
naturally infected t. annulata, divided 4 subgroups according to
their parasitemia rates (<1%, 1-3%, 3-5% >5%). also, ten non-infected cattle 
were sampled control group. blood samples taken jugular vein into
acid citrate dextrose-containing tubes measuring hematological parameters and
b (cd(4) cd(8)) cell populations without anticoagulant for
tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma sialic acid concentrations. remarkable decreases
observed red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs) packed cell
volume (pcv) infected cattle compared healthy ones (p < 0.05). also, with
increase parasitemia rate, total lymphocytes monocytes alleviated the
diseased groups. contrast, total neutrohpils concentrations of
tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma total sialic acids significantly elevated (p <
0.05) infected animals. accordingly, circulatory populations cd(4) 
cd(8) cells b cells showed substantial decrease, significant
increase observed (cd(4) cd(8)) cells cattle infected <1%
parasitemia rates. decreased circulatory cell population shows ineffective 
responses cells stimulatory cytokines ifn-gamma tnf-alpha.
on hand, elevation cytokines (particularly ifn-gamma) sialic
acids presumably inhibitory role circulatory b cell population in
infected cattle. addition, high level sialic acid concentration indicates
the probable role sialic acid regulate parasite-host cell adhesion
during sporozoites invasion.
