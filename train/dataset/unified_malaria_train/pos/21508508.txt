plasmodium falciparum subset patients lead diffuse
encephalopathy known cerebral malaria (cm). despite treatment, mortality
caused cm high 30% 10% survivors disease may
experience short- long-term neurological complications. pathogenesis of
cm involves alterations cytokine chemokine expression, local inflammation,
vascular injury repair processes. diverse factors limited rate
of discovery prognostic predictors fatal cm. identification reliable
early predictors cm severity enable clinicians adjust risk with
appropriate management cm. recent studies revealed elevated levels of
cxcl10 expression cerebrospinal fluid peripheral blood plasma
independently predicted severe fatal cm. cxcr3, promiscuous receptor of
cxcl10, plays important role pathogenesis mouse model cm. this
study role corresponding cxcr3 ligands (cxcl11, cxcl10, cxcl9 & cxcl4) 
fatal severe cm evaluated comparing levels 16 healthy control 
(hc), 26 mild malaria (mm), 26 cerebral malaria survivors (cms) 12
non-survivors (cmns) using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). levels of
cxcl4 cxcl10 significantly elevated cmns patients (p < 0.05) when
compared hc, mm cms. elevated plasma levels cxcl10 cxcl4 were
tightly associated cm mortality. receiver operating characteristic (roc)
curve analysis revealed cxcl4 cxcl10 discriminate cmns mm (p < 
0.0001) cms (p <0.0001) area curve (auc)=1. results
suggest cxcl4 cxcl10 play prominent role pathogenesis cm
associated death may used functional surrogate biomarkers for
predicting cm severity.
