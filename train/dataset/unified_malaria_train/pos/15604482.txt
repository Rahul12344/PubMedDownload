the objective study characterize immune response babesia
bigemina-infected cows second trimester pregnancy. twelve animals
were divided four groups (i, ii, iii, iv); groups ii pregnant
cows, groups iii iv non-pregnant cows. groups iii infected
with virulent strain babesia bigemina, doses utilized 1 x 10(7)
infected red blood cells im. groups ii iv noninfected control groups.
all infected animals severely affected; days 5-7 post-inoculation
(dpi) showed clinical signs: fever (40-41.5 degrees c), packed cell volume
reduction, parasitemia, specific treatment required. immune
response monitored daily 0-11 dpi. shown flow cytometry analysis, 
in infected animals distribution peripheral blood t-cells
subpopulations (cd4+, cd8+, gammadelta t-cells) affected compared to
the control groups. elisa, ifn-gamma production showed trend increase 
plasma 6-10 dpi; noninfected cows showed lowest optical density
values. rt-pcr, th1 predominant response observed, tnfalpha, inf-gamma
and inos detected. contrast il-4 il-10 weak undetected. the
results trial discussed.
