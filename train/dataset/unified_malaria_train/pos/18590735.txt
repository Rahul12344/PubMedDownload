theileria parva causes acute lympho-proliferative disease cattle, can
result death susceptible animals within 2-3 weeks infection. analyses of
the cellular response lymph node draining site infection
demonstrated early cell response, appearance large numbers of
uninfected lymphoblasts 6 9 days p.i., coinciding initial
detection parasitised cells. marked increase representation
of cd8(+) cells emergence sizable sub-population cd2(-) cd8(+) 
alpha/beta cells period. analysis cell receptor beta chain
variable (tcr bv) gene expression reveal evidence involvement
of superantigen stimulating response. responding lymph node cells were
found produce increased quantities ifngamma il-10, cd2(+) 
cd8(+) cd2(-) cd8(+) populations expressed ifngamma transcripts. purified
cd2(+) cd8(+) cells proliferated stimulated vitro autologous
parasitised cells non-specific mitogens, whereas cd2(-) cd8(+) cells were
refractory stimuli. contrast parasite-specific cytotoxic
activity associated cell responses immune cattle, responses to
primary infection exhibited variable levels non-specific cytotoxic activity.
stimulation purified cd2(+) cd8(+) cells vitro autologous
parasitised cells also failed reveal evidence specific cytotoxic activity. 
these findings indicate primary infection t. parva induces aberrant 
t cell response lacks appropriate effector activity.
