background: plasma angiopoietin (ang)-2 associated disease severity and
mortality adults children falciparum malaria. however mechanism
of action angiopoietins fatal malaria unclear. study aimed to
determine whether expression ang-1 ang-2 receptor tie-2 in
cerebral endothelial parenchymal cells specific cerebral malaria (cm), 
correlated coma severe clinical features, whether plasma and
csf levels markers correlated clinical neuropathological
features severe fatal malaria vietnamese adults.
methods: immunohistochemistry performed ang-1, ang-2 tie-2 on
post-mortem brain tissue fatal malaria cases controls. quantitative
elisa plasma cerebrospinal fluid levels ang-1, ang-2 tie-2 was
done compare fatal cases surviving patients study.
results: immunohistochemistry revealed significant differences expression in
endothelial parenchymal cells compared controls. however no
significant difference expression markers endothelial cells,
astroglial cells neurons cm non-cerebral malaria cases.
immunostaining ang-1, ang-2 tie-2 also associated plasmodium 
falciparum-infected erythrocyte sequestration brain. however ang-1 and
ang-2 expression neurons significantly correlated incidence of
microscopic haemorrhages. plasma levels ang-2 ang-2/ang-1 ratio were
associated number severe malaria complications significant
and independent predictors metabolic acidosis fatal outcome.
conclusions: independent prognostic significance ang-2 ang-2/ang-1
ratio severe malaria confirmed, although immunohistochemistry fatal
cases reveal increased expression brain endothelium cerebral versus
non-cerebral cases. activation ang-tie-2 pathway severe malaria is
therefore related acidosis, number severity criteria outcome, is
not specific event brain cerebral malaria.
