aim: analyze effect native buffalo lactoferrin (bulf) protein along
with nanoformulation using alginate-enclosed, chitosan-conjugated, calcium
phosphate buffalo lf nanocapsules (aec-cco-cp-bulf ncs) rodent parasite
plasmodium berghei.
materials & methods: balb/c mice infected malaria parasite efficacy
of proteins (bulf ncs) evaluated measuring parasitemia,
initialization, role mirna absorption ncs, parasite load by
histopathology quantitative determination, cytokine levels, bioavailability
and immunohistochemistry localize lf protein.
results: ncs significantly reduced parasite load mice compared bulf
and untreated group. ncs found modulating disease profile mice 
as shown immunohistochemistry, free radical ion production higher survival
tendency.
conclusion: study confirms ncs internalized changed expression
of mirnas enhanced uptake various organs leading to
inhibitory effect parasite well maintenance fe
metabolism.
