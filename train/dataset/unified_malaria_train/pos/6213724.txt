immunoresponsiveness patients acute babesiosis characterized.
lymphocyte subpopulations, mononuclear cell responses nonspecific mitogens,
and serum immunochemical values studied patients acute babesiosis 
and recovery (four 40 months), controls, seropositive individuals.
serum studies also carried retrospectively stored sera patients 
with babesiosis. mean differential lymphocyte counts percentages b
lymphocytes higher controls patients acute babesiosis, and
levels lymphocytes bearing igg fc receptor (t gamma) significantly 
(p less 0.01) elevated. responses nonspecific mitogens suppressed
during acute babesiosis. levels serum igg igm clq binding were
significantly increased whereas c3 c4 levels hemolytic activity were
suppressed acute-phase sera. apparent paradox increased t
suppressor/cytotoxic population presence evidence increased vivo 
lymphocyte function discussed terms heterogeneity gamma
subpopulation.
