immunity induced plasmodium vivax infection leads memory cell recruitment
activated "relapse" "re-infection". study aims characterise
memory cells patients acute convalescent p. vivax infection.
lymphocytes collected patients infected p. vivax, immune controls
and naive controls. proportion immature memory cells, expressing
cd45ro(+)cd27(+), mature cells lacking cd27 assessed. statistically
significant increase median percentage memory cell subsets expressing
cd4(+) observed material patients acute infection compared
with either naive immune controls. high percentage memory t
cells infected patients maintained 60 days post treatment. the
immune controls living malaria endemic area somewhat increased
proportion memory cell subsets expressing cd8(+). approximately
three-fold increase cell types shown patients acute
infection level persisted 60 days post treatment. phenotypic
characterisation peripheral lymphocytes acute infection revealed
that large fraction lymphocytes carried gammadelta phenotypes
suggesting role cells early response p. vivax. very
low levels p. vivax specific antibody found. might suggest that
cell-mediated immunity may play greater role development naturally
acquired protection p. vivax infection humoral immunity. results
provide insight mechanism cell-mediated immunity p. vivax 
infection could important future development successful
vaccine anti-malarial drug designation.
