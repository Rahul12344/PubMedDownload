background: cytokine-mediated endothelial activation pathway known mechanism
of pathogenesis employed plasmodium falciparum induce severe disease
symptoms human host. though considered benign, complicated cases plasmodium
vivax reported worldwide pakistan. hypothesized
that p.vivax utilizes similar mechanism pathogenesis, p.falciparum 
for manifestations severe malaria. therefore, main objective study
was characterize role cytokines endothelial activation markers in
complicated plasmodium vivax isolates pakistan.
methods principle findings: case control study using plasma samples from
well-characterized groups suffering p.vivax infection including
uncomplicated cases (n=100), complicated cases (n=82) healthy controls
(n=100) investigated. base line levels tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α),
interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-10 (il-10), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(icam-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1(vcam-1) e-selectin measured by
elisa. correlation cytokines endothelial activation markers done using
spearman's correlation analysis. furthermore, significance biomarkers as
indicators disease severity also analyzed. results showed tnf-α, 
il-10, icam-1and vcam-1 3-fold, 3.7 fold 2 fold increased between
uncomplicated complicated cases. comparison healthy controls with
uncomplicated cases showed significant difference tnf-α concentrations
while il-6, il-10, icam-1, vcam-1 e-selectin found elevated
respectively. addition, significant positive correlation observed 
tnf-α il-10/ icam-1, il-6 il-10, icam-1 vcam-1.a receiver operating
curve (roc) generated showed tnf-α, il-10, icam-1 vcam-1 
the best individual predictors complicated p.vivax malaria.
conclusion: results suggest though endothelial adhesion molecules are
inducible pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α, however, cytokine-mediated
endothelial activation pathway clearly demonstrated mechanism of
pathogenesis complicated p.vivax malaria cases pakistan.
