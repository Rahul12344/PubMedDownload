populations exposed plasmodium falciparum infection develop genetic mechanisms
of protection severe malarial disease. despite decades genetic
epidemiological research, sickle cell trait (hbas) sickle cell polymorphism, 
abo blood group, hemoglobinopathies remain major determinants
in severe malaria replicated across different african populations study
designs. within case-control study region high transmission tanzania
(n = 983), investigated role 40 new loci identified recent
genome-wide studies. 32 loci passing quality control procedures, found
polymorphisms usp38, frem3, sdc1, ddc, loc727982 genes putatively
associated differential susceptibility severe malaria. established
candidates explained 7.4% variation severe malaria risk (hbas polymorphism,
6.3%; α-thalassemia, 0.3%; abo group, 0.3%; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency, 0.5%) new polymorphisms, another 4.3%. regions
encompassing loci identified promising targets design future
treatment control interventions.
