the intracellular parasite theileria eukaryote known transform its
mammalian host cells. investigated host mechanisms involved in
parasite-induced transformation phenotypes. tumour progression multistep
process, yet 'oncogene addiction' implies cancer cell growth survival
can impaired inactivating single gene, offering rationale targeted 
molecular therapies. furthermore, feedback loops often act key regulatory hubs
in tumorigenesis. searched micrornas involved addiction regulatory
loops leukocytes infected theileria parasites. show theileria
transformation involves induction host bovine oncomir mir-155, via the
c-jun transcription factor ap-1 activity. identified novel mir-155
target, det1, evolutionarily-conserved factor involved c-jun
ubiquitination. show mir-155 expression led repression det1
protein, causing stabilization c-jun driving promoter activity 
bic transcript containing mir-155. positive feedback loop critical to
maintain growth survival theileria-infected leukocytes; transformation
is reversed inhibiting ap-1 activity mir-155 expression. first 
demonstration theileria parasites induce expression host non-coding
rnas highlights importance novel feedback loop maintaining the
proliferative phenotypes induced upon parasite infection. hence, parasite
infection drives epigenetic rewiring regulatory circuitry host
leukocytes, placing mir-155 crossroads infection, regulatory
circuits transformation.
