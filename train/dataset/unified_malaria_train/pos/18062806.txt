background: microarray analyses allow identification assessment of
molecular signatures whole tissues undergoing pathological processes. to
better understand cerebral malaria pathogenesis, investigated intra-cerebral
gene-expression profiles well-defined genetically cerebral malaria-resistant
(cm-r) cm-susceptible (cm-s) mice, upon infection plasmodium berghei anka 
(pba). investigated mouse transcriptional responses early late stages
of infection use cdna microarrays.
results: rigorous statistical approach multiple testing
corrections, showed pba significantly altered brain gene expression in
cm-r (balb/c), cm-s (cba/j c57bl/6) mice, 327 genes
discriminated early late infection stages, mouse strains, and
between cm-r cm-s mice. identified 104, 56, 84 genes with
significant differential expression cm-r cm-s mice days 2, 5, 
7 respectively. analysis functional annotation indicates genes 
involved metabolic energy pathways, inflammatory response, the
neuroprotection/neurotoxicity balance play major role cerebral malaria
pathogenesis. addition, data suggest cerebral malaria alzheimer's
disease may share common mechanisms pathogenesis, illustrated the
accumulation beta-amyloid proteins brains cm-s mice, cm-r
mice.
conclusion: microarray analysis highlighted marked changes several
molecular pathways cm-s compared cm-r mice, particularly early stages of
infection. study revealed promising areas exploration may both
provide new insight knowledge cm pathogenesis development 
novel therapeutic strategies.
