invasion hepatocytes plasmodium sporozoites prerequisite for
establishment malaria natural infection. molecular mechanisms underlying
sporozoite invasion largely unknown. previously reported cd81 is
required hepatocytes infection plasmodium falciparum plasmodium
yoelii sporozoites. cd81 belongs tetraspanin superfamily transmembrane 
proteins. interacting transmembrane proteins,
tetraspanins may play role lateral organization membrane proteins. in
this study, investigated role two major molecular partners cd81 
in hepatocytic cells, cd9p-1/ewi-f ewi-2, two transmembrane proteins
belonging novel subfamily immunoglobulin proteins. show cd9p-1
silencing increases host cell susceptibility p. yoelii sporozoite
infection, whereas ewi-2 knock-down effect. conversely, overexpression 
cd9p-1 ewi-2 partially inhibits infection. using cd81 cd9p-1 chimeric
molecules, demonstrate role transmembrane regions cd81-cd9p-1
interactions. importantly, cd9p-1 chimera longer associates cd81
does affect infection. based data, conclude cd9p-1 acts a
negative regulator p. yoelii infection interacting cd81 regulating
its function.
