monocyte (mo) subpopulations display distinct phenotypes functions 
drastically change inflammatory states. hypothesized discrete mo
subpopulations induced malaria infection associated with
anti-parasitic activity. characterized phenotype blood mo healthy 
malaria-exposed individuals patients acute uncomplicated malaria
by flow cytometry. addition, mo defense function evaluated vitro 
antibody dependent cellular inhibition (adci) assay. time admission,
the percentages absolute numbers cd16+ mo, ccr2+cx3cr1+ mo, high 
in majority patients. remarkably, expression ccr2 cx3cr1 the
cd14(high (hi)) mo subset defined two subgroups patients also differed
significantly functional ability limit parasite growth, through
the adci mechanism. group patients highest percentages and
absolute numbers cd14(hi)ccr2+cx3cr1+ mo highest mean levels adci
activity, blood parasitemias lower (0.14+/-0.34%) second group
(1.30+/-3.34%; p = 0.0053). data showed that, malaria attack, some
patients' mo exert strong adci activity. results bring new insight
into complex relationships phenotype functional activity 
of blood mo patients healthy malaria-exposed individuals suggest
discrete mo subpopulations induced malaria infection are
associated anti-parasitic activity.
