this study carried 68 theileria annulata naturally infected buffaloes 
in addition 25 parasitologically free buffaloes distributed small herds 
dakahlia gharbya governorates, egypt, demonstrate clinical picture
associated theileriosis buffaloes particular emphasis the
oxidative stress ketosis relationship. clinical signs recorded infected
buffaloes form fever, enlargement one lymph node,
ocular discharge, corneal opacity, skin lesions, decreased milk yield, pale
mucous membrane anorexia. blood serum analysis revealed significant
(p<or=0.05) decrease rbcs hb concentration infected animals compared
to control ones. moreover, significant increase (p<or=0.05) levels beta
hydroxy butyric acid (bhba) non-esterified free fatty acid (nefa) a
significant decrease (p<or=0.05) levels reduced glutathione (r.gsh),
superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), total antioxidant capacity (tac),
nitric oxide (no), glucose glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) in
infected animals compared control ones. concluded t. annulata
plays important role occurrence anemia, oxidative ketotic
stressor egyptian water buffaloes.
