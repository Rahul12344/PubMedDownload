the tick-borne protozoan parasite theileria annulata causes debilitating
disease cattle called tropical theileriosis. parasite predominantly
invades bovine macrophages (m phi) induces host cell transformation a
mechanism fully elucidated. infection associated loss
of characteristic phi functions phenotypic markers, indicative host cell
de-differentiation. investigated effect t. annulata infection on
the expression phi differentiation marker c-maf. up-regulation of
c-maf mrna levels observed bovine monocyte differentiation phi was
suppressed t. annulata infection. furthermore, mrna levels c-maf the
closely related transcription factor mafb significantly lower established
t. annulata-infected cell-lines bovine monocyte-derived phi. treatment 
of t. annulata-infected cells theileriacidal drug buparvaquone induced
up-regulation c-maf mafb, correlated altered expression of
down-stream target genes, e.g. up-regulation integrin b7 down-regulation
of il12a. furthermore, t. annulata infection associated suppression
of transcription factors, pu.1 runx1, colony stimulating factor 1
receptor (csf1r) also involved regulation monocyte/m phi
differentiation. believe results provide first direct evidence 
t. annulata modulates host phi differentiation state, may diminish
the defence capabilities infected cell and/or promote cell proliferation. 
musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene (maf) transcription factors play an
important role cell proliferation, differentiation survival; therefore,
regulation genes may major mechanism employed t. annulata to
survive within infected phi.
