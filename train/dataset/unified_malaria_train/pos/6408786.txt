the role played complement fibrinolysis pathogenesis pulmonary
oedema disseminated, subendothelial, petechial haemorrhages cattle
infected theileria parva investigated. marked reduction in
total haemolytic complement animals died disease whereas the
survivors showed transient changes. reduction c3 levels animals
with severe disease, however, equivalent survivors. neither
circulating soluble immune complexes free antibody macroschizonts
were detected sera cattle severe infection. addition the
complement changes, high levels fibrinogen degradation products (fdps) were
detected sera infected animals. rate production fdps and
reduction total haemolytic complement paralleled clinical course the
disease. is, therefore, suggested pulmonary oedema disseminated
petechial haemorrhages seen east coast fever may direct result the
combined effects complement activation consumption fibrinogen and
fibrin.
