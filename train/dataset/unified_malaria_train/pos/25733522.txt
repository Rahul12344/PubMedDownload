tryptophan-rich proteins play important biological functions plasmodium
parasite. plasmodium vivax contains remarkably large numbers proteins
belonging "pv-fam-a" family need characterized. earlier, we
reported presence memory cells naturally acquired antibodies against
15 proteins p. vivax malaria-exposed individuals (m. zeeshan, h.
bora, y. d. sharma, j infect dis 207:175-185, 2013,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis650). here, sought characterize and
ascertain cross talk effector responses b cells malarial 
patients pv-fam-a family proteins. therefore, expressed the
remaining 21 proteins escherichia coli studied humoral and
cellular immune responses based parameters used previous
study. naturally acquired igg antibodies detected 21 antigens in
p. vivax patient sera (37.7 94.4% seropositivity). antigens able to
activate lymphocytes p. vivax-exposed individuals, activated
cd4(+) lymphocytes produced higher levels th1 (interleukin-2 [il-2] and
gamma interferon [ifn-γ]) th2 (il-4 il-10) cytokines healthy
controls, response th2 biased. combined results present and
previous studies seem suggest striking link induction cd4(+) 
t cell response naturally acquired antibodies 36 proteins 
pv-fam-a family, majority conserved sequences parasite 
population. work required utilize information develop
immunotherapeutic treatments disease.
