ovine babesiosis important disease china responsible economic
losses. several babesia strains involved, babesia sp. bq1 (lintan) and
babesia sp. bq1 (ningxian) particularly prevalent guansu region.
babesia divergens, contrast, experimentally infect spleen-intact sheep,
but induce clinical signs. immune response spleen-intact sheep to
babesia sp. bq1 (lintan) b. divergens therefore compared identify
the immune mechanisms involved pathogenicity. greater pathogenicity of
babesia sp. bq1 (lintan) b. divergens confirmed: sheep infected 
with babesia sp. bq1 (lintan), b. divergens, developed hyperthermia 
and showed patent parasitaemia giemsa-stained blood smears ear vein. 
furthermore, parasites also detected blood jugular vein
of babesia sp. bq1 (lintan)-infected sheep. pathogenicity babesia spp.
involved cellular responses, humoral responses. interferon-gamma was
produced specifically activated pbmc b. divergens-infected sheep and
interleukin-10 specifically activated pbmc babesia sp. bq1
(lintan)-infected sheep. role cytokines course infection
by babesia spp. discussed.
