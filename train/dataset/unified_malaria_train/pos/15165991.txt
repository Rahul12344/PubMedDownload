in normal subjects, elevation plasma free fatty acid (ffa) levels stimulates
gluconeogenesis (gng) inhibits glycogenolysis (gly). adults with
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria, gng increased gly decreased. 
to test hypothesis ffas regulators gng gly uncomplicated
falciparum malaria, investigated effect inhibition lipolysis by
acipimox 12 patients uncomplicated falciparum malaria. six were
given acipimox, six served controls. also controls, six matched healthy
subjects studied two occasions without acipimox. 16 h of
fasting, glucose production gng significantly higher malaria
patients compared healthy controls (p = 0.003 < 0.0001,
respectively), whereas gly significantly lower (p < 0.001), together with
elevated plasma concentrations cortisol glucagon. study,
glucose production patients declined time (p < 0.0001), without a
statistically significant difference acipimox-treated untreated
patients. controls, however, acipimox decline less outspoken
compared nontreated controls (p = 0.005). gng unchanged time in
patients well healthy controls, influence acipimox found. 
in patients, gly declined time (p < 0.001), without difference between
acipimox-treated untreated patients. contrast, controls treated with
acipimox, change time found, statistically different from
the decline untreated controls (p = 0.002). conclusion, falciparum
malaria, ffas involved regulation glucose production, gng or
gly.
