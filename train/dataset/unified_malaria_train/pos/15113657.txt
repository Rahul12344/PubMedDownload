the pathogenic mechanisms involved tropical theileriosis, caused the
tick-borne protozoan parasite theileria annulata, unclear. pathology is
associated schizont stage parasite, resides within bovine
macrophages. breed-specific differences pathology observed in
cattle, several bos indicus breeds relatively resistant tropical
theileriosis whilst bos taurus cattle highly susceptible. infected cells
express pro-inflammatory cytokines hypothesized these
cytokines play major role pathology disease. therefore, using
quantitative rt-pcr investigated expression key candidates,
interleukin 1 beta (il-1beta), il-6 tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha),
in t. annulata low passage infected cell lines derived ex vivo experimental 
infection resistant susceptible cattle. mrna cytokine was
detected cell lines investigated levels higher observed in
resting monocytes. however, analyses identify breed-specific
differences. therefore, results consistent hypothesis that
differential regulation infected cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines
(il-1beta, il-6 tnf-alpha) accounts breed-related differences in
resistance susceptibility t. annulata infection. other, currently unknown 
mechanisms may greater importance.
