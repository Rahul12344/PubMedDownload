plasmodium parasites infect liver replicate inside hepatocytes before
they invade erythrocytes trigger clinical malaria. analysis host signaling
pathways affected liver-stage infection could provide critical insights into
host-pathogen interactions reveal targets intervention. using protein
lysate microarrays, found plasmodium yoelii rodent malaria parasites
perturb hepatocyte regulatory pathways involved cell survival, proliferation, 
and autophagy. notably, prodeath protein p53 substantially decreased in
infected hepatocytes, suggesting could targeted parasite to
foster survival. indeed, mice express increased levels p53 showed reduced
liver-stage parasite burden, whereas p53 knockout mice suffered increased
liver-stage burden. furthermore, boosting p53 levels use small
molecule nutlin-3 dramatically reduced liver-stage burden vitro vivo.
we conclude perturbation hepatocyte p53 pathway critically impacts
parasite survival. thus, host pathways might constitute potential targets for
host-based antimalarial prophylaxis.
