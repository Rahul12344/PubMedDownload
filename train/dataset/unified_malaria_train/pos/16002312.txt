a role heart pathophysiology severe plasmodium falciparum
malaria recently suggested. objective present study to
substantiate finding large group african children correlate
results metabolic conditions children. furthermore, impact a
potential cardiac impairment outcome severe cases assessed. results may
have important implications currently ongoing debate fluid management
in severe malaria patients. plasma levels n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
peptide (nt-probnp), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (h-fabp), myoglobin
and creatine kinase muscle-brain (ck-mb) compared 400 african children
with severe mild falciparum malaria. plasma levels markers were
correlated lactate glucose blood levels, indicators hypovolemia, and
with clinical outcome. children suffering severe malaria children who
died (n = 22) exhibited high high levels cardiac markers,
respectively. cardiac factors predictive fatal outcome,
while, multivariate analysis, lactic acidosis important
biochemical predictor death severe malaria group. lactic acidosis and
hypoglycemia, however, result cardiac impairment defined elevated levels
of circulating cardiac proteins. results point hypovolemia major
underlying cause lactic acidosis hypoglycemia african children with
severe falciparum malaria. deleterious metabolic conditions contribute to
myocardial affection evident predictive per se fatal
outcome.
