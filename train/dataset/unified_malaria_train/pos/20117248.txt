to explore hypothesis angiotensin ii may play role the
susceptibility cerebral malaria (cm), performed genetic association study
of malaria patients orissa, india analyzing three snps (ace2 c-->t, inos
c-->t, enos glu-->asp) two i/d polymorphisms (ace i/d il-4 b1/b2). our
results showed 'd' allele ace i/d polymorphism, responsible for
increased ang ii production significant association mild malaria and
the ace2 c-->t substitution gender specific effect possibly reduced
expression ace2 presence 't' allele women leading increased level 
of ang ii hence protection cm. combined genotype analysis enos
glu-->asp substitution responsible increased production plasmodium
falciparum infected individuals ace i/d polymorphism also showed stronger
association (glu-asp+asp-asp/id+dd) genotypes mild malaria (p<0.0001).
whether antiplasmodial activity and/or unknown mechanisms, ang ii 
protects susceptibility cerebral malaria remains investigated.
these genetic findings may contribute understanding malaria
pathogenesis.
