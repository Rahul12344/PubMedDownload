proinflammatory responses induced plasmodium falciparum
glycosylphosphatidylinositols (gpis) thought involved malaria
pathogenesis. study, investigated role mapk-activated protein
kinase 2 (mk2) regulation tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and
interleukin (il)-12, two major inflammatory cytokines produced by
macrophages stimulated gpis. show mk2 differentially regulates the
gpi-induced production tnf-alpha il-12. although tnf-alpha production 
markedly decreased, il-12 expression increased 2-3-fold gpi-stimulated 
mk2(-/-) macrophages compared wild type (wt) cells. mk2(-/-) macrophages
produced markedly decreased levels tnf-alpha wt macrophages mainly
because lower mrna stability translation. case il-12, mrna was
substantially higher mk2(-/-) macrophages wt. enhanced production is
due increased nf-kappab binding gene promoter, markedly lower level
expression transcriptional repressor factor c-maf, decreased binding
of gap-12 gene promoter mk2(-/-) macrophages. thus, data
demonstrate first time role mk2 transcriptional regulation 
of il-12. using protein kinase inhibitors sb203580 u0126, also show
that erk p38 pathways regulate tnf-alpha il-12 production, that
both inhibitors reduce phosphorylation mk2 response gpis other
toll-like receptor ligands. results may important implications for
developing therapeutics malaria infectious diseases.
