cerebral malaria severe often fatal complication plasmodium
falciparum infection. characterized parasite sequestration, breakdown 
of blood-brain barrier, strong inflammation brain. we
investigated role cannabinoid receptor 2 (cb2), important modulator
of neuroinflammatory responses, experimental cerebral malaria (ecm).
strikingly, mice deletion cb2-encoding gene (cnr2(-/-)) inoculated 
with plasmodium berghei anka erythrocytes exhibited enhanced survival a
diminished blood-brain barrier disruption. therapeutic application specific 
cb2 antagonist also conferred increased ecm resistance wild type mice.
hematopoietic derived immune cells responsible enhanced protection
in bone marrow (bm) chimeric cnr2(-/-) mice. mixed bm chimeras revealed
that cb2-expressing cells contributed ecm development. heterogeneous
cd11b(+) cell population, containing macrophages neutrophils, expanded the
cnr2(-/-) spleen infection expressed macrophage mannose receptors,
arginase-1 activity, il-10. also cnr2(-/-) brain, cd11b(+) cells 
expressed selected anti-inflammatory markers accumulated, expression of
inflammatory mediators ifn-γ tnf-α reduced. finally, m2 macrophage
chemokine ccl17 identified essential factor enhanced survival in
the absence cb2, ccl17 × cnr2 double-deficient mice fully
susceptible ecm. thus, targeting cb2 may promising development of
alternative treatment regimes ecm.
