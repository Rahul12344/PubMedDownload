background: lack continuous vitro culture system blood stages 
malarial parasites unique tropism reticulocytes, plasmodium
vivax plasmodium yoelii 17x reticulocyte-prone strain, hinders research
in organisms. maturation reticulocytes erythrocytes a
complex process involving selective removal membrane proteins 
transferrin receptor, cd71. order advance characterization of
infected cells experimental infections balb/c mice p. yoelii 17x, 
cd71 expression erythroid cells (ter119+) assessed vitro culture of
p. yoelii 17x attempted adding reticulocytes highly expressing cd71.
methods: balb/c mice infected p. yoelii 17x-gfp transgenic parasites
and erythroid cells (ter119+) analysed blood, spleen bone marrow
cells. ter119, cd71 gfp expression assessed different points
post-infection flow cytometry. moreover, vitro culture p. yoelli 17x was
attempted adding red blood cells (rbcs) mice pyruvate kinase
deficiency, contain high percentages cd71hi cells peripheral blood as
compared healthy animals.
results: predominance erythroid cells lacking expression cd71 (cd71-) was
observed peripheral blood spleen normal infected animals ten 
days post-infection (pi). ten days pi, however, dramatic temporal switch 
erythroid cells highly expressing cd71 (cd71hi) observed spleen at
day 15 pi peripheral blood infected cells. distribution erythroid 
cells expressing differently cd71 noticed bone marrow. yet, similar to
peripheral blood spleen, predominance cd71hi cells observed at
15 days pi. remarkably, cd71hi cells cells predominantly infected in
these organs well peripheral blood. attempts thus made culture
in vitro p. yoelli 17x strain adding rbcs pyruvate kinase-deficient
mice containing high percentages cd71hi cells peripheral blood.
conclusions: parasite preference immature cells rare normal
peripheral blood could important implications development in
vitro culture system p. vivax.
