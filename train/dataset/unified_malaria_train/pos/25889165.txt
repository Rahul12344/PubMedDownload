background: underlying causes severe malarial anaemia multifactorial. 
in previously reports, plasmodium vivax found able directly
inhibited erythroid cell proliferation differentiation. molecular
mechanisms underlying suppression erythropoiesis p. vivax are
remarkably complex remain unclear. study, phosphoproteomic approach
was performed dissect molecular mechanism phosphoprotein regulation,
which involved inhibitory effect parasites erythroid cell
development.
methods: study describes first comparative phosphoproteome analysis of
growing erythroid cells (gecs), derived human haematopoietic stem cells,
exposed lysates infected erythrocytes (ie)/uninfected erythrocytes (ue) for
24, 48 72 h. study utilized imac phosphoprotein isolation directly
coupled lc ms/ms analysis.
results: lysed ie significantly inhibited gec growth 48 72 h cell
division resulting accumulation cells g0 phase. relative levels 
of forty four phosphoproteins determined gecs exposed ie/ue for
24-72 h compared media control using label-free quantitation
technique. interestingly, levels three phosphoproteins: ezrin, alpha
actinin-1, rho kinase significantly (p < 0.05) altered. proteins
display interactions involved regulation cellular
cytoskeleton. particularly affected ezrin (phosphorylated thr567), which
is normally localized gec cell extension peripheral processes. following
exposure ie, 48-72 h, ezrin signal intensity weak absent. 
result suggests phospho-ezrin important actin cytoskeleton regulation
during erythroid cell growth division.
conclusions: findings suggest parasite proteins able inhibit
erythroid cell growth down-regulation ezrin phosphorylation, leading to
ineffective erythropoiesis ultimately resulting severe malarial anaemia. a
better understanding mechanisms ineffective erythropoiesis may be
beneficial development therapeutic strategies prevent severe
malarial anaemia.
