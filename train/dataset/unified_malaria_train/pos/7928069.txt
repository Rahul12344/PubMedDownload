plasmodium berghei infection impaired hepatic heme synthesizing machinery 
mice. key enzymes, viz. s-aminolevulinic acid synthase, s-aminolevulinic acid
dehydrase ferrochelatase found decreased. contrast, tryptophane
pyrrolase noticeably increased parasitic infection. oral feeding of
chloroquine [16 mg (kg body weight)-1 x 4 days] cleared parasitaemia from
infected mice within 72 h returned altered levels enzymes almost to
normal week cessation treatment, exception tryptophane
pyrrolase, remained unaffected. chloroquine treatment cause any
significant alteration above-mentioned enzymes normal mice.
