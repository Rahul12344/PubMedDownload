the ability plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (irbcs) bind 
vascular endothelium, thus enabling sequestration vital host organs, an
important pathogenic mechanism malaria. adhesion p. falciparum irbcs to
platelets, results formation irbc clumps, another
cytoadherence phenomenon associated severe disease. here, have
used vitro cytoadherence assays demonstrate, knowledge first
time, p. falciparum irbcs use 32-kda human protein gc1qr/habp1/p32 
receptor bind human brain microvascular endothelial cells. addition, 
show p. falciparum irbcs also bind gc1qr/habp1/p32 platelets to
form clumps. study thus identified novel host receptor used for
both adhesion vascular endothelium platelet-mediated clumping. given the
association adhesion vascular endothelium platelet-mediated clumping
with severe disease, adhesion gc1qr/habp1/p32 p. falciparum irbcs may play 
an important role malaria pathogenesis.
