background: erythrocytic schizogony, plasmodium falciparum interacts 
the human erythrocyte membrane enters into, grows within escapes from
the erythrocyte. interaction p. falciparum m18 aspartyl
aminopeptidase (pfm18aap) human erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin was
recently identified using phage display technology. study, recombinant
(r) pfm18aap characterized interaction enzyme and
spectrin, well erythrocyte membrane proteins, analyzed.
methods: rpfm18aap produced hexahistidine-fusion protein escherichia 
coli purified using magnetic bead technology. pi enzyme was
determined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis number subunits in
the native enzyme estimated ferguson plots. enzymatic activity 
a ph temperature range tested coupled enzyme assay. blot overlays
were performed validate spectrin-pfm18aap interaction, well identify
additional interactions enzyme erythrocyte membrane
proteins. sequence analysis identified conserved amino acids expected to
be involved cofactor binding, substrate cleavage quaternary structure
stabilization.
results: rpfm18aap molecular weight ~67 kda enzyme separated 
three entities pi 6.6, 6.7 6.9. non-denaturing gel electrophoresis
indicated rpfm18aap aggregated oligomers. vitro coupled enzyme
assay showed rpfm18aap cleaved n-terminal aspartate tripeptide
substrate maximum enzymatic activity ph 7.5 37 degrees c. the
spectrin-binding region pfm18aap found homo sapiens, saccharomyces
cerevisiae otherplasmodium species homologues. amino acids expected be
involved cofactor binding, substrate cleavage quaternary structure
stabilization, conserved. blot overlays rpfm18aap spectrin and
erythrocyte membrane proteins indicated rpfm18aap binds spectrin, well
as protein 4.1, protein 4.2, actin glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
conclusion: studies characterizing rpfm18aap showed enzyme interacts
with erythrocyte spectrin membrane proteins. suggests that, in
addition proposed role hemoglobin digestion, pfm18aap performs other
functions erythrocyte host utilize several substrates, which
highlights multifunctional role malaria enzymes.
