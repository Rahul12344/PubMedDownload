reactive oxygen species important mediators tissue injury malaria
infection. status hepatic oxidative stress antioxidant defence indices
were studied plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (p. y. nigeriensis) infection
and chloroquine/ polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized polylysine and
carboxymethylcellulose (poly iclc) treatment infected mice. p. y. nigeriensis 
infection resulted significant increase oxidative stress indices viz.,
xanthine oxidase rate lipid peroxidation (lpo). accompanied 
highly significant increase antioxidant defence indices viz., reduced
glutathione (gsh) glutathione reductase superoxide dismutase (sod) 
catalase showed highly significant decrease respect normal mice.
chloroquine treatment infected mice caused decrease parasitaemia which
was associated restoration indices altered infection towards
normalization. poly iclc treatment infected mice caused change blood
parasitaemia resulted significant increase gsh, glutathione
reductase, sod catalase respect infected mice. combination therapy of
chloroquine poly iclc resulted clearance parasitaemia restoration
of oxidative stress antioxidant defence indices normal levels.
