background: order establish successful infection human host, the
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum must establish interactions variety
of human proteins surface different cell types, well with
proteins inside host cells. better understand aspect malaria
pathogenesis, study conducted goal identifying interactions
between proteins parasite human host.
methods: modified yeast two-hybrid methodology preferentially selects
protein fragments expressed yeast used conduct
high-throughput screens p. falciparum protein fragments human liver 
and cerebellum libraries. resulting dataset analyzed exclude
interactions likely occur human host infection.
results: initial set 2,200 interactions curated remove proteins that
are unlikely play role pathogenesis based annotation or
localization, proteins behave promiscuously two-hybrid assay,
resulting final dataset 456 interactions. cluster implicates
binding p. falciparum pfe1590w/etramp5, putative parasitophorous
vacuole membrane protein, human apolipoproteins apoa, apob apoe was
selected analysis. different isoforms apoe, associated
with different outcomes malaria infection, shown display differential 
interactions pfe1590w.
conclusion: dataset interactions proteins p. falciparum those
of human host generated. preferential interaction p.
falciparum pfe1590w protein human apoe epsilon3 apoe epsilon4
isoforms, apoe epsilon2 isoform, supports hypothesis apoe
genotype affects risk malaria infection. dataset contains other
interactions potential relevance disease may identify possible vaccine
candidates drug targets.
