ovine malignant theileriosis fatal disease characterized severe
progressive anemia. order elucidate underlying mechanisms involved in
anemia, study designed assess antioxidant status erythrocyte 
oxidative injuries iranian fat-tailed sheep suffered malignant
theileriosis. infected animals (infected group), composed 50 iranian sheep
about 1-2 years old, naturally infected theileria sp., divided into
three subgroups according parasitemia rates (<1%, 1-3%, 3-5%), ten
non-infected animals also selected control group. blood samples 
taken hematological parameters, activities antioxidant enzymes
including superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) catalase, 
erythrocyte osmotic fragility, serum concentrations trace elements
(copper, iron, zinc, manganese, selenium), measured. index of
lipid peroxidation, level malondialdehyde (mda) also determined.
according results, significant decrease red blood cell (rbc) count,
packed cell volume, activities sod, gpx, catalase (p <0.001), also
serum concentrations cu, zn, mn, se (p < 0.05) evident the
infected sheep. contrast, significantly increased levels mda and
erythrocyte osmotic fragility (p < 0.001) well serum concentration iron 
(p < 0.05) recorded infected animals. significant decrease in
antioxidant enzyme activities substantial elevated levels lipid
peroxidation erythrocyte osmotic fragility associated increase in
parasitemia indicate increased exposure rbcs oxidative damage. also, it
appears disturbed antioxidant defense mechanisms promote development
of anemia ovine theileriosis.
