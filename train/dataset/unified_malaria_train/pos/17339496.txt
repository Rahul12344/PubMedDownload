cd36 scavenger receptor implicated malaria pathogenesis 
well innate defense blood-stage infection. inflammatory responses to
plasmodium falciparum gpi (pfgpi) anchors believed play important role 
in innate immune response malaria. investigated role cd36 in
pfgpi-induced mapk activation proinflammatory cytokine secretion.
furthermore, explored role receptor experimental model of
acute malaria vivo. demonstrate erk1/2, jnk, p38, c-jun became
phosphorylated pfgpi-stimulated macrophages. contrast, pfgpi-induced
phosphorylation jnk, erk1/2, c-jun reduced cd36(-/-) macrophages
and cd36(-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less tnf-alpha response to
pfgpi wild-type counterparts. addition, demonstrate role for
cd36 innate immune response malaria vivo. compared wild-type mice, 
cd36(-/-) mice experienced severe fatal malaria challenged with
plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi as. cd36(-/-) mice displayed combined defect in
cytokine induction parasite clearance dysregulated cytokine response
to infection, earlier peak parasitemias, higher parasite densities, higher
mortality rates wild-type mice. results provide direct evidence that
pfgpi induces tnf-alpha secretion cd36-dependent manner support role
for cd36 modulating host cytokine response innate control acute
blood-stage malaria infection vivo.
