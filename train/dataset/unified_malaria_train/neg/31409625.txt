eukaryotic flagella conserved microtubule-based organelles drive cell
motility. plasmodium, causative agent malaria, single flagellate
stage: male gamete mosquito. three rounds endomitotic division in
male gametocyte together unusual mode flagellum assembly rapidly
produce eight motile gametes. processes tightly coordinated, 
regulation poorly understood. understand important developmental
stage, studied function location microtubule-based motor
kinesin-8b, using gene-targeting, electron microscopy, live cell imaging.
deletion kinesin-8b gene showed effect mitosis disrupted 9+2
axoneme assembly flagellum formation male gamete development also 
completely ablated parasite transmission. live cell imaging showed that
kinesin-8b-gfp co-localise kinetochores nucleus instead
revealed dynamic, cytoplasmic localisation basal bodies the
assembling axoneme flagellum formation. we, thus, uncovered unexpected 
role kinesin-8b parasite flagellum formation vital the
parasite life cycle.
