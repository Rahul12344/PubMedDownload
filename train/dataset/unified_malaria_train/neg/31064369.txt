background: traditional epidemiological approaches supported
significant reductions malaria incidence across many countries, higher
resolution information local regional malaria epidemiology be
needed efficiently target interventions elimination. application of
genetic epidemiological methods analysis parasite genetics has, thus
far, primarily confined research settings. illustrate these
technical methods used advance programmatic operational needs of
national malaria control programmes (nmcps), accelerate global progress to
eradication, manuscript presents seven use cases genetic
epidemiology approaches parasite genetic data informative the
decision-making nmcps.
methods: use cases developed highly iterative process that
included extensive review literature global guidance documents,
including 2017 world health organization's framework malaria elimination,
and collection stakeholder input. semi-structured interviews conducted
with programmatic technical experts needs opportunities for
genetic epidemiology methods malaria elimination.
results: seven use cases developed: detect resistance, assess drug
resistance gene flow, assess transmission intensity, identify foci, determine
connectivity parasite populations, identify imported cases, characterize
local transmission chains. method currently used provide information
sought, population unit implementation, pre-conditions using these
approaches, post-conditions intended product use case were
identified use case.
discussion: framework use cases prioritize research development 
of genetic epidemiology methods best achieve goals nmcps, and
ultimately, inform establishment normative policy guidance uses.
with significant engagement stakeholders malaria endemic countries and
collaboration local programme experts ensure strategic implementation,
genetic epidemiological approaches tremendous potential accelerate global
malaria elimination efforts.
