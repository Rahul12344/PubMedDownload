pyronaridine, mannich base antimalarial agent high activity against
chloroquine-resistant plasmodium falciparum, combined artesunate as
a new artemisinin based combination therapy (act). pyronaridine-artesunate
combination could one choices treatment uncomplicated
falciparum malaria multidrug-resistant areas including thailand. aim of
this study determine vitro sensitivity cross-resistance pattern 
pyronaridine thai isolates p. falciparum. addition, influence of
resistant genes concerning vitro pyronaridine sensitivity determined. 
mean pyronaridine 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) 118 parasite isolates
was 5.6 ± 3.1 nm (range = 0.2-15.4 nm) significant positive correlation
with artesunate ic50 (r = 0.246, p = 0.008) amodiaquine ic50 (r = 0.220, p = 
0.042) significant negative correlation quinine ic50 (r = -0.185, p = 
0.047). parasites containing pfmdr1 86y allele exhibited significantly
reduced pyronaridine sensitivity compared pfmdr1 n86 allele
(7.6 ± 3.3 nm 5.4 ± 3.0 nm, respectively, p = 0.032, independent test);
however, difference may clinically relevant. pyronaridine-artesunate
could candidate act treat multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in
thailand careful monitoring.
