chloroquine (cq)-resistant plasmodium vivax present countries p.
vivax infection endemic, underlying molecular mechanisms responsible
remain unknown. increased expression p. vivax crt-o (pvcrt-o) been
correlated vivo cq resistance area low-grade resistance. we
assessed pvcrt-o expression isolates papua (indonesia), p. vivax is
highly cq resistant. ex vivo drug susceptibilities cq, amodiaquine,
piperaquine, mefloquine, artesunate determined using modified schizont
maturation assay. expression levels pvcrt-o measured using novel
real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr method. large variations in
pvcrt-o expression observed across 51 isolates evaluated, fold 
change expression level ranging 0.01 59 relative seen the
p. vivax β-tubulin gene 0.01 24 relative seen p.
vivax aldolase gene. expression significantly higher isolates the
majority parasites ring stage development (median fold change, 1.7) 
compared trophozoite stage (median fold change, 0.5; p < 0.001). 
twenty-nine isolates fulfilled criteria ex vivo drug susceptibility
testing showed high variability cq responses (median, 107.9 [range, 6.5 to
345.7] nm). controlling parasite stage, found pvcrt-o
expression levels correlate ex vivo response cq 
to antimalarials tested. results highlight importance of
development-stage composition measuring pvcrt-o expression suggest that
pvcrt-o transcription primary determinant ex vivo drug
susceptibility. comprehensive transcriptomic approach warranted an
in-depth investigation role gene expression levels p. vivax drug
resistance.
