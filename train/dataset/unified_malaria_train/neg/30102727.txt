pore forming proteins belonging membrane attack/perforin
(macpf) family important functions many organisms. five macpf
proteins found plasmodium parasites, three functions cell passage 
one host cell egress. report analysis perforin-like protein 
4, pplp4, rodent parasite plasmodium berghei. found protein is
expressed ookinete, invasive stage parasite formed 
mosquito midgut. transcriptional analysis revealed expression pplp4
gene commences ookinete development. protein detected retorts
and mature ookinetes. using two antibodies, protein found localized 
dotted pattern, 3-d sim super-resolution microcopy revealed protein in
the periphery cell. analysis c-terminal mcherry fusion protein
however showed mainly cytoplasmic label. pplp4 null mutant formed motile
ookinetes, unable invade traverse midgut epithelium
resulting severely impaired oocyst formation transmission naïve
mice. however, vitro cultured ookinetes injected thorax 
the mosquito, thus by-passing midgut passage, sporozoites formed the
mutant parasites able infect naïve mice. taken together, data show
that pplp4 required ookinete invasion mosquito midgut. thus
pplp4 similar role previously studied pplp3 pplp5, raising the
question three proteins macpf domains needed invasion the
ookinete mosquito midgut epithelium.
