objective: depict mitochondrial genetic variation first time among
anopheles minimus (an.minimus) (diptera: culicidae) species two malaria
endemic states ne india.
methods: phylogeographic analysis carried 9 12 sites an.minimus 
confirmed malaria endemic places.
results: sequences adenine-thymine rich regions. transitions were
observed 6 sequences 5 mutations synonymous substitutions 1 
case non synonymous mutation observed. three distinct clusters haplotypes 
were generated. haplotype diversity low nucleotide diversity studied.
overall negative values obtained tajima's test fu'sfs test indicate 
recent genetic population expansion. network analysis explained sequence
diversity also shown mutations 6 sequences.
conclusions: high genetic diversity observed within populations an.minimus
species several possible implications vector control region.
