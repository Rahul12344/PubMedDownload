artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) effective widely used
treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria cornerstone
for malaria control prevention globally. resistance artemisinin
derivatives confirmed greater mekong subregion (gms) and
manifests slow parasite clearance patients reduced ring stage
susceptibility artemisinins survival assays. p. falciparumkelch13 gene 
mutations associated artemisinin-resistant parasites widespread in
the gms. genotyped 277 samples collected observational study from
2012 2016 eight provinces thailand identify p. falciparum kelch13
mutations. results combined previously reported genotyping results 
from thailand construct map illustrating evolution p. falciparum
kelch13 mutations 2007 2016 country. different mutant alleles
were found strains different geographical origins. artemisinin
resistance-conferring y493h r539t mutations detected mainly eastern
thailand (bordering cambodia), p574l found western thailand and
r561h northwestern thailand. c580y mutation found across the
entire country nearing fixation along thai-cambodia border. overall, 
the prevalence artemisinin resistance mutations increased last 10
years across thailand, especially along thai-cambodia border. molecular
surveillance therapeutic efficacy monitoring intensified the
region assess extent spread artemisinin resistance.
