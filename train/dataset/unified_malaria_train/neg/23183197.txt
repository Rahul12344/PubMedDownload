malaria protozoan disease transmitted bite anopheles mosquito.
among five species infect humans, plasmodium falciparum responsible
for severe human malaria. resistance p. falciparum chloroquine and
pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, conventionally used antimalarial drugs, already
widely distributed many endemic areas. result, artemisinin-based
combination therapies rapidly widely adopted first-line
antimalarial treatments since mid-2000s. recent population evolutionary
genetic analyses proven geographic origins parasite lineages
resistant conventional drugs considerably limited. almost all
resistance emerged either southeast asia south america. greater
mekong subregion southeast asia probably alarming source of
resistance, p. falciparum resistant chloroquine and
pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine dispersed africa. emergence artemisinin
resistance also recently confirmed greater mekong. global
malaria programme recently launched "global plan artemisinin resistance
containment," aims prevent spread artemisinin resistance while
also stopping emergence novel resistance. however, inadequate
understanding mechanism artemisinin resistance lack reliable
genetic markers monitor artemisinin resistance make difficult survey the
spread resistance. elucidation markers would substantially contribute 
to design effective policy containment artemisinin
resistance.
