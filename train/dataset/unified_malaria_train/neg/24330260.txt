malaria parasites scavenge nutrients host also harbour enzymatic
pathways de novo macromolecule synthesis. one pathway is
apicoplast-targeted type ii fatty acid synthesis, essential late
liver-stage development rodent malaria. likely fatty acids
synthesized apicoplast ultimately incorporated membrane
phospholipids necessary exoerythrocytic merozoite formation. hypothesized 
that synthesized fatty acids utilized apicoplast-targeted
phosphatidic acid synthesis, phospholipid precursor. phosphatidic acid is
typically synthesized three-step reaction utilizing three enzymes: glycerol 
3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase and
lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. plasmodium genome predicted to
harbour genes apicoplast- cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum-targeted
phosphatidic acid synthesis. research shows apicoplast-targeted
plasmodium yoelii glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase glycerol 3-phosphate
acyltransferase expressed liver-stage development deletion of
the encoding genes resulted late liver-stage growth arrest lack of
merozoite differentiation. however, predicted apicoplast-targeted
lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase gene refractory deletion was
expressed solely endoplasmic reticulum throughout parasite life cycle.
our results suggest p. yoelii incomplete apicoplast-targeted
phosphatidic acid synthesis pathway essential liver-stage maturation.
