the lack rapid, affordable, accurate diagnostic tests represents the
primary hurdle affecting malaria surveillance resource- expertise-limited 
areas. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) sensitive, rapid, and
cheap diagnostic method. five species-specific lamp assays developed based
on 18s rrna gene. sensitivity specificity lamp results calculated 
compared microscopic examination nested polymerase chain reaction. lamp 
reactions highly sensitive detection limit one copy for
plasmodium vivax, plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium malariae 10 copies
for plasmodium knowlesi plasmodium ovale. lamp positively detected human 
malaria species positive samples (n = 134; sensitivity = 100%) within 35
minutes. negative samples amplified lamp (n = 67; specificity =
100%). lamp successfully detected two samples low parasitemia. lamp may
offer rapid, simple, reliable test diagnosis malaria areas
where malaria prevalent.
