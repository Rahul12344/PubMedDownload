immune response (ir) genes, originally proposed baruj benacerraf explain
differential antigen-specific responses animal models, become synonymous 
with major histocompatibility complex (mhc). discovered non-mhc-linked
ir gene t cell receptor (tcr) locus required cd8+ t cell
responses plasmodium berghei gap5040-48 epitope mice expressing mhc
class allele h-2db. gap5040-48-specific cd8+ t cell responses emerged a
very large pool naive vβ8.1+ precursors, dictated susceptibility
to cerebral malaria conferred protection recombinant listeria
monocytogenes infection. structural analysis prototypical vβ8.1+
tcr-h-2db-gap5040-48 ternary complex revealed germline-encoded
complementarity-determining region 1β residues present exclusively vβ8.1
segment mediated essential interactions gap5040-48 peptide.
collectively, findings demonstrated vβ8.1 functioned ir gene
that indispensable immune reactivity malaria gap5040-48
epitope.
