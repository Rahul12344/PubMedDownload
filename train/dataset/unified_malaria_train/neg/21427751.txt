the high mortality widespread impact malaria resulted disease
being strongest evolutionary selective force recent human history, and
genes confer resistance malaria provide best-known case
studies strong positive selection modern humans. begin reviewing jbs
haldane's initial contribution potential malaria genetic resistance 
humans. further, discuss population genetics aspects many the
variants, including globin, g6pd deficiency, duffy, ovalocytosis, abo human
leukocyte antigen variants. many variants conferring resistance malaria
are 'loss-of-function' mutants appear recent polymorphisms the
last 5000-10 000 years less. discuss estimation selection coefficients
from case-control data make predictions change s, c and
g6pd-deficiency variants. addition, consider predicted joint changes
when two β-globin alleles c variable population
and variation α-thalassemia s, two unlinked, but
epistatic variants. becomes known genes conferring genetic
resistance malaria humans, population genetics approaches contribute
both investigating past selection predicting consequences future
generations variants.
