we assembled great snipe blood transcriptome using data fourteen lekking
males, order de novo identify candidate genes related sexual selection, 
and determined expression profiles relation mating success. three
most highly transcribed genes encoding different haemoglobin subunits. all
tended overexpressed males high mating success. also called
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) transcriptome data found
considerable genetic variation many genes expressed lekking. among
these, identified 14 polymorphic candidate snps significant
genotypic association mating success (number females mated with) and/or
mating status (mated not). four candidate snps found hbaa
(encoding haemoglobin α-chain). heterozygotes one one snp in
the gene pabpc1 appeared enjoy higher mating success compared males
homozygous either alleles. larger data set individuals, we
genotyped 38 identified snps found low support consistent
selection one zygosities previously identified candidate snps
and none genotypes associated mating status. however,
candidate snps generally showed lower levels spatial genetic structure
compared noncandidate markers. also scored prevalence avian malaria 
in subsample birds. males infected avian malaria parasites lower
mating success year sampling noninfected males. parasite infection
and interaction specific genes may thus affect performance lek.
