the binding domain plasmodium vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp-ii) a
promising blood-stage vaccine candidate vivax malaria. development of
a successful vivax malaria vaccine based dbp-ii, antigenic diversity and
also naturally occurring functional antibodies different pvdbp-ii variant
types various populations must determined. however, similar other
blood-stage antigens, allelic variation within pvdbp-ii fundamental
challenge development broadly efficient vaccine. present study
was performed define whether polymorphisms pvdbp-ii influence the
nature functional inhibitory activity naturally acquired induced
anti-dbp-ii antibodies mice. investigation, five genetically distinct 
variants pvdbp-ii transiently expressed cos-7 cell surface.
erythrocyte-binding inhibition assay (ebia) performed using human sera
infected corresponding non-corresponding p. vivax variants well by
the use mice sera immunized different expressed recombinant pvdbp-iis.
ebia results showed inhibitory percentage varied 50 63 % 
using sera infected individuals, case mouse antisera, inhibition
was range 76-86 %. interestingly, significant difference was
detected red blood cell binding inhibition different pvdbp-ii variants on
the cos-7 cell surfaces incubated heterologous homologous sera
infected pvdbp-ii variants. suggests detected polymorphisms in
all five forms pvdbp-ii may affect functional activity anti-dbp-ii
antibodies. conclusion, results revealed functional
cross-reactive antibody responses heterologous pvdbp-ii variants might
provide broader inhibitory response all, least majority of
strains compared single allele protein considered in
development pvdbp-ii-based vaccine.
