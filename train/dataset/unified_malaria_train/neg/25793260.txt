understanding transmission movement plasmodium parasites crucial
for malaria elimination prevention resurgence. located limit of
malaria transmission pacific, vanuatu ideal candidate for
elimination programs due low endemicity isolated nature island 
setting. analyzed variation merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) 
the circumsporozoite protein (csp) p. falciparum p. vivax populations to
examine patterns gene flow population structures among seven sites 
five islands vanuatu. genetic diversity general higher p. vivax than
p. falciparum site. p. vivax, high genetic diversity likely 
maintained greater extent gene flow among sites among islands.
consistent different patterns gene flow, proportion genetic
variance found among islands substantially higher p. falciparum
(28.81-31.23%) p. vivax (-0.53-3.99%). data suggest current 
island-by-island malaria elimination strategy vanuatu, adequate p.
falciparum elimination, might need complemented centrally
integrated measures control p. vivax movement across islands.
