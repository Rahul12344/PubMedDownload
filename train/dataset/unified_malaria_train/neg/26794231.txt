the southern cattle tick, rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus (canestrini), is
the economically important cattle ectoparasite world. rhipicephalus
microplus rhipicephalus annulatus (say) continue threaten u.s. cattle
producers despite eradication importation barrier based inspection,
dipping imported cattle organophosphate (op) acaricide, quarantine of
infested premises. op acaricides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (ache), essential
to tick central nervous system function. unlike vertebrates, ticks possess at
least three genes encoding aches, differing amino acid sequence and
biochemical properties. genomic analyses r. microplus related tick,
ixodes scapularis, suggest ticks contain many genes encoding different
aches. work first report salivary cholinesterase (che) activity 
in r. microplus, discusses complexity cholinergic system ticks 
significance tick salivary che tick-host interface. provides
three hypotheses salivary che plausibly functions 1) reduce presence 
of potentially toxic acetylcholine present large bloodmeal imbibed 
rapid engorgement, 2) modulate immune response (innate and/or acquired) of
the host tick antigens, 3) influence transmission establishment 
pathogens within host animal. ticks vectors greater number and
variety pathogens parasite, second mosquitoes
(owing malaria) vectors serious human disease. saliva-assisted
transmission (sat) pathogens well-known; however, salivary components
participating sat process remain elucidated.
