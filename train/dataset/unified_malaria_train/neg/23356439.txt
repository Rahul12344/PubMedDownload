malaria's cycle infection requires parasite transmission mosquito
vector mammalian host. demonstrate plasmodium yoelii
pumilio-fbf family member puf2 allows sporozoite remain infectious 
mosquito salivary glands awaiting transmission. puf2 mediates solely
through rna-binding domain (rbd) likely stabilizing hastening the
degradation specific mrnas. puf2 traffics sporozoite cytosolic granules,
which negative several markers stress granules p-bodies, and
disappear rapidly infection hepatocytes. contrast previously
described plasmodium berghei pbpuf2(-) parasites, pypuf2(-) sporozoites no
apparent defect host infection tested early salivary gland residence, 
but become progressively non-infectious prematurely transform eefs
during prolonged salivary gland residence. premature overexpression puf2
in oocysts causes striking deregulation sporozoite maturation infectivity 
while extension puf2 expression liverstages causes defect, suggesting
that presence puf2 alone sufficient functions. finally, 
conducting first comparative rna-seq analysis plasmodium sporozoites, we
find puf2 may play role directly indirectly maintaining the
homeostasis specific transcripts. findings uncover requirements for
maintaining window opportunity malaria parasite accommodate the
unpredictable moment transmission mosquito mammalian host.
