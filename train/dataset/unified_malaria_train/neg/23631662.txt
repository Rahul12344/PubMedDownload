background: transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs), target sexual stages
of malaria parasites interfere and/or inhibit parasite's development 
within mosquitoes, regarded promising targets disrupting the
malaria transmission cycle. study, genetic diversity four tbv
candidate antigens, pvs25, pvs28, pvs48/45, pvwarp, among plasmodium vivax
korean isolates analysed.
methods: total 86 p. vivax-infected blood samples collected patients in
korea used analyses. full-length genes encoding four tbv
candidate antigens, pvs25, pvs28, pvs48/45, pvwarp, amplified pcr,
cloned t&a vector, sequenced. polymorphic characteristics the
genes analysed using dnastar, mega4, dnasp programs.
results: polymorphism analyses 86 korean p. vivax isolates revealed two
distinct haplotypes pvs25 pvs48/45, three different haplotypes in
pvwarp. contrast, pvs28 showed single haplotype. nucleotide
substitutions amino acid changes identified four tbv candidate
antigens commonly found p. vivax isolates geographic areas.
the overall nucleotide diversities tbv candidates much lower than
those blood stage antigens.
conclusions: limited sequence polymorphisms tbv candidate antigens were
identified korean p. vivax population. results provide baseline
information developing effective tbv based antigens, offer
great promise applications tbv p. vivax infection regions
where parasite prevalent.
