introduction: plasmodium falciparum, deadly agent malaria, notorious
for capacity develop drug resistance. treatment failures artemisinin
therapy regimens (actc), present mainstay, emerging. transporter
coding pfmdr1 gene central node process, associated with
in vitro vivo parasite response broad range act antimalarials.
areas covered: review covers historical origins pfmdr1 discovery, 
followed detailed description sequence expression
characteristics, well structural functional characteristics 
coded transmembrane protein. pfmdr1 association act drugs response vivo
and vitro thoroughly reviewed. reference made significant compounds
presently development pipeline. literature search focused on
pubmed based searches occasional resource edited books, world health
organization documentation conference reports adding valuable details.
expert commentary: pfmdr1 emerged central gene p. falciparum act
resistance. understanding basis role critical epidemiologic
surveillance design improved resistance-refractory antimalarials.
specifically, unveiling situations drug collateral sensitivity associated with
specific pfmdr1 genetic variation provide opportunities personalized
optimal therapy options.
