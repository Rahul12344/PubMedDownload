artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) first-line antimalarial
regimen indonesia. susceptibility plasmodium falciparum artemisinin is
falling greater mekong subregion, known whether efficacy
of current combinations also threatened nearby sumatera. evaluated the
genetic loci pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfk13, considered selection by
artemisinin combination therapy, among 404 p. falciparum infections identified by
pcr detection cross-sectional survey 3,731 residents three regencies. 
the pfcrt haplotype svmnt (codons 72 76) prevalent displayed 
significant linkage disequilibrium pfmdr1 haplotype yy (codons 86 and
184) (odds ratio [or] 26.7; 95% confidence interval [ci], 5.96 239.4;
p < 0.001). contrasts mekong countries, cviet haplotype of
pfcrt predominates. among 231 evaluable isolates, 9 (3.9%) showed any
evidence nonsynonymous gene variants propeller domain pfk13 the
thr474ala variant seen six individuals, cys580tyr identified 
low confidence single isolate asymptomatic individual. among 
subset 117 symptomatic p. falciparum-infected individuals randomized to
receive either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine artemether-lumefantrine, the
treatment outcome associated pretreatment genotype. however,
submicroscopic persistent parasites day 28 day 42 follow-up were
significantly likely harbor pfmdr1 haplotype nf (codons 86 184)
than pretreatment isolates (p < 0.001 treatment groups). current
act regimens appear effective sumatera, evidence persistent
submicroscopic infection patients suggests detailed studies of
drug susceptibility undertaken.
