background: malaria continues one severe global infectious
diseases, major threat human health economic development.
network-based biological analysis promising approach uncover key genes
and biological processes network viewpoint, could recognized 
from individual gene-based signatures.
results: integrated gene co-expression profile protein-protein
interaction transcriptional regulation information construct a
comprehensive gene co-expression network plasmodium falciparum. based 
network, identified 10 core modules using ice (iterative clique
enumeration) algorithm, essential malaria parasite development 
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc) stages. module, genes
were highly correlated probably due co-regulation formation protein
complex. genes recognized differentially coexpressed
among three close-by idc stages. gene prpf8 (pfd0265w) encoding pre-mrna
processing splicing factor 8 product identified dcgs (differentially
co-expressed genes) among idc stages, although gene function seldom
reported previous researches. integrating species-specific gene prediction
and differential co-expression gene detection, found modules could
perform species-specific functions according genes modules
were species-specific genes, like module 10. furthermore, order reveal 
the underlying mechanisms erythrocyte invasion p. falciparum, steiner
tree algorithm employed identify invasion subnetwork gene
co-expression network. subnetwork-based analysis indicated some
important plasmodium parasite specific genes could corporate 
be co-regulated parasite invasion process, including a
head-to-head gene pair pfrh2a (pf13_0198) pfrh2b (mal13p1.176).
conclusions: study based gene co-expression network could shed new
insights mechanisms pathogenesis, even virulence p. falciparum
development.
