bioinformatics functional screens identified group family a-type dna
polymerase (pola) genes encoded viruses inhabiting circumneutral alkaline 
hot springs yellowstone national park us great basin. proteins
encoded viral pola genes (polas) shared significant sequence
similarity known viral proteins remarkably similar polas
encoded two three families bacterial phylum aquificae several
apicoplast-targeted pola-like proteins found eukaryotic phylum
apicomplexa, includes obligate parasites plasmodium, babesia, and
toxoplasma. viral gene products share signature elements previously
associated aquificae apicomplexa pola-like proteins were
similar proteins encoded prophage elements variety otherwise
unrelated bacteria, additionally encoded prototypical bacterial
pola. unique among known viral dna polymerases, viral pola proteins this
study share apicomplexa proteins large amino-terminal domains with
putative helicase/primase elements low primary sequence similarity. the
genomic context distribution, phylogeny, biochemistry pola
proteins suggest thermophilic viruses transferred pola genes the
apicomplexa, likely secondary endosymbiosis virus-infected
proto-apicoplast, common ancestor two three aquificae families, 
where displaced orthologous cellular pola gene. basis of
biochemical activity, gene structure, sequence similarity, speculate 
the xenologous viral-type pola genes may functions associated with
diversity-generating recombination bacteria apicomplexa.
