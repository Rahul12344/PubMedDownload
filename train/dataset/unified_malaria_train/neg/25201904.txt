plasmodium-induced malaria widely infects primates mammals. multiple
past studies revealed positive selection could main evolutionary
force triggering genetic diversity anti-malaria resistance-associated
genes human primates. however, researchers focused attention 
on infra-generic intra-specific genome evolution rather analyzing
the complete evolutionary history mammals. extend previous research by
testing evolutionary link natural selection eight candidate genes
associated malaria resistance mammals. three eight genes were
detected affected recombination, including tnf-α, inos darc.
positive selection detected rest five immunogenes multiple times in
different ancestral lineages extant species throughout mammalian
evolution. signals positive selection exposed four malaria-related
immunogenes primates: ccl2, il-10, ho1 cd36. however, selection signals of
g6pd detected non-primate eutherians. significantly higher
evolutionary rates radical amino acid replacement also detected 
primate cd36, suggesting functional divergence eutherians.
prevalent positive selection throughout evolutionary trajectory mammalian 
malaria-related genes supports arms race evolutionary hypothesis host
