the proper rapid assimilation proteins nutrients blood meal
creates significant metabolic challenge mosquito. better understand 
this process generated global profile metabolite changes response to
blood meal anopheles gambiae, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(gc-ms). disrupt key pathway amino acid metabolism silenced gene
phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) involved conversion amino acid
phenylalanine tyrosine. observed increased levels phenylalanine and
the potentially toxic metabolites phenylpyruvate phenyllactate well a
reduction amount tyrosine available melanin synthesis. turn
resulted significant impairment melanotic encapsulation response
against rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. furthermore silencing 
pah resulted significant impairment mosquito fertility associated with
reduction laid eggs, retarded vitellogenesis impaired melanisation 
chorion. carbidopa, inhibitor downstream enzyme dopa decarboxylase that
coverts dopa dopamine, produced similar effects egg melanization and
hatching rate suggesting egg chorion maturation mainly regulated via
dopamine. study sheds new light role amino acid metabolism in
regulating reproduction immunity.
