control malaria vector an. gambiae still largely obtained through
chemical intervention using pyrethroids, permethrin. however, strains 
an. gambiae resistant toxic effects pyrethroids become
widespread several endemic areas last decade. objective this
study assess differences five life-history traits (larval developmental
time body weight, fecundity, hatch rate, longevity adult females) 
and energy metabolism strain an. gambiae resistant to
permethrin (rsp), due knockdown resistance enhanced metabolic
detoxification, permethrin susceptible strain reared laboratory
conditions. also quantified expression levels five antioxidant enzyme
genes: gste3, cat, gpxh1, sod1, sod2. found rsp strain a
longer developmental time susceptible strain. additionally, rsp adult
females higher wet body weight increased water glycogen levels.
compared permethrin susceptible females, rsp females displayed reduced
metabolic rate mitochondrial coupling efficiency higher mitochondrial ros
production. furthermore, despite higher levels gste3 cat transcripts, rsp 
females shorter adult life span susceptible females. collectively,
these results suggest permethrin resistance alleles might affect energy
metabolism, oxidative stress, adult survival an. gambiae. however, because
the strains used study differ genetic backgrounds, results
need interpreted caution replicated strains have
significant implications malaria transmission vector control.
