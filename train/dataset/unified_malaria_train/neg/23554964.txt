previous work suggests brazilian plasmodium falciparum limited genetic
diversity history bottlenecks, multiple reintroductions due human
migration, clonal expansions. hypothesized brazilian p. falciparum
would exhibit clonal structure. examined isolates collected across two decades
from amapá, rondônia, pará state (n = 190). examining microsatellites
markers chromosomes previous studies, hoped define extent 
of low diversity, linkage disequilibrium, bottlenecks, population structure, 
parasite migration within brazil. used retrospective genotyping samples
from 1980s 1990s explore population genetics sp resistant dhfr 
and dhps alleles. tested existing hypothesis triple mutant dhfr
mutations 50r/51i/108n 51i/108n/164l developed southern amazon a
single origin common similar parasites. found brazilian p.
falciparum limited genetic diversity isolation distance rejected, 
which suggests underwent bottlenecks followed migration sites.
unlike peru, appeared gene flow across brazilian amazon basin. we
were unable divide parasite populations clonal lineages pairwise fst
were common. parasite diversity found within sites brazilian
amazon, according amova. results challenge hypothesis triple
mutant alleles arose single lineage southern amazon. sp resistance,
at double triple mutant stages, developed twice potentially in
different regions brazilian amazon. would required samples from
before 1980s describe sp resistance spread across basin or
describe complex internal migration brazilian parasites the
colonization efforts past decades. brazilian amazon basin may have
sufficient internal migration drug resistance reported particular
region rapidly spread parts basin similar drug pressure.
