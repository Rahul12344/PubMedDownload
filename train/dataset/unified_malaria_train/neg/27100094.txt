malaria control efforts continuously stymied drug-resistant strains 
of plasmodium falciparum, typically originate southeast asia prior to
spreading high-transmission settings africa. one earlier proposed
explanation southeast asia hotbed resistance the
hypermutability "accelerated resistance multiple drugs" (armd) phenotype,
whereby multidrug-resistant southeast asian parasites reported exhibit
1,000-fold higher rates resistance unrelated antimalarial agents when
compared drug-sensitive parasites. however, three recent studies not
recapitulate hypermutability phenotype. intriguingly, genome sequencing of
recently derived multidrug-resistant cambodian isolates identified high
proportion dna repair gene mutations multidrug-resistant parasites,
suggesting potential role shaping local parasite evolution. adapting 
fluctuation assays use p. falciparum, examined vitro
mutation rates five recent cambodian isolates three reference laboratory
strains. studies also generated knockout parasite line lacking the
dna repair factor exonuclease i. assays, parasites typed 
ability acquire resistance kae609, currently advanced clinical trials,
yielding 13 novel mutations na+/h+-atpase pfatp4, primary resistance
determinant. observed evidence hypermutability. instead, found
evidence mild mutator (up 3.4-fold increase mutation rate) phenotype
in two artemisinin-resistant cambodian isolates, carry dna repair gene
mutations. observed one mutation mismatch repair protein mlh1
contributes mild mutator phenotype modeled yeast (scmlh1-p157s).
compared basal rates mutation, mild mutator phenotype may provide a
greater overall benefit parasites southeast asia terms generating
drug resistance without incurring detrimental fitness costs.
