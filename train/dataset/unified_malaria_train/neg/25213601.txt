insecticide resistance major impediment control vectors pests 
of public health importance strongly selected trait capable rapid
spread, sometimes even closely related species. elucidating the
mechanisms generating insecticide resistance mosquito vectors disease, 
understanding spread resistance within populations species
are vital development robust resistance management strategies. here,
we studied mechanisms resistance two sympatric members anopheles
gambiae species complex-the major vector malaria sub-saharan africa-to
understand resistance developed spread eastern uganda, region
with highest levels malaria. eastern uganda, the
mosquitoes anopheles arabiensis an. gambiae found sympatrically, low
levels hybrids (0.4 %) occur, offering route introgression adaptively
important variants species. independent microarray studies of
insecticide resistance, gste4, insect-specific glutathione s-transferase, 
among significantly up-regulated genes species. test the
hypothesis interspecific introgression, sequenced 2.3 kbp encompassing
gste4. whilst detailed sequencing ruled introgression, detected
strong positive selection acting gste4. however, sequences, followed 
haplotype-specific qpcr, showed apparent up-regulation an. arabiensis
is result allelic variation across microarray probe binding sites 
artefactually elevates gene expression signal. thus, face-value acceptance of
microarray data misleading advisable conduct detailed 
investigation causes nature signal. identification of
positive selection acting locus led us functionally express and
characterise allelic variants gste4. although vitro data support
a direct role gste4 metabolism, support role enzyme 
insecticide sequestration. thus, demonstration role up-regulated 
gene metabolic resistance insecticides limited simply
whether metabolise insecticide; strict criterion would argue
against involvement gste4 despite weight evidence contrary.
