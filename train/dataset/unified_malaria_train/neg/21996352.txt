an interesting element eukaryotic genomes large quantity non-coding 
intervening sequences commonly known introns, regularly interrupt
functional genes therefore must removed prior use genetic
information cell. splicing, mature rna exported the
nucleus cytoplasm. error process recognition removal 
introns, splicing, would lead change genetic message thus has
potentially catastrophic consequences. thus splicing highly complex
essential step eukaryotic gene expression. takes place spliceosome,
which dynamic rna-protein complex made snrnps non-snrnp proteins. the
splicing process consists following sequential steps: spliceosome formation,
the first transesterification second transesterification reactions, release
of mature mrna recycling snrnps. spliceosomal components
produce complex network rna-rna, rna-protein protein-protein
interactions spliceosome experience remodeling splicing cycle.
helicases essentially required almost step resolution rna-rna 
and/or rna-protein interactions. rna helicases share highly conserved helicase 
domain includes motif dexd/h single letter amino acid code. this
article focus members dexd/h-box proteins involved specially in
splicing malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.
