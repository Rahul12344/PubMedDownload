malaria caused unicellular protozoan pathogen genus plasmodium.
although genes represent monocistronic units expressed life cycle
stage-specific manner, post-transcriptional regulation via translational
repression mrna observed parasite stages transition 
vertebrate host anopheles vector. interesting new type of
post-transcriptional control recently discovered plasmodium falciparum
stages infect human erythrocytes. subgroup genes thought to
be transcriptionally silent actually transcribed degraded immediately 
an rnase ii recruited gene loci. cryptic rna not
detectable steady-state rna detected using nuclear run-on
techniques mutant rnase ii parasites. nascent rna degradation controls
virulence genes expressed monoallelic fashion noncoding rnas (ncrnas),
but also number housekeeping-like genes. studies life cycle
stages may reveal full extent type gene regulation malaria
parasites. tempting speculate rnase ii-mediated gene control may
exist eukaryotic organisms.
