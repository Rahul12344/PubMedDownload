egress malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum host red blood cell
is rapid, highly regulated event essential maintenance and
completion parasite life cycle. egress protease-dependent is
temporally associated extensive proteolytic modification parasite
proteins, including family papain-like proteins called sera are
expressed parasite parasitophorous vacuole. previous work shown that
the abundant sera, sera5, plays important non-enzymatic role in
asexual blood stages. sera5 extensively proteolytically processed a
parasite serine protease called sub1 well unidentified cysteine protease
just prior egress. however, neither function sera5 role 
processing known. show conditional disruption sera5 gene, 
or sera5 related sera4 genes simultaneously, results a
dramatic egress replication defect characterised premature host cell
rupture failure daughter merozoites efficiently disseminate,
instead transiently retained within residual bounding membranes. sera5 is
not required poration (permeabilization) vesiculation host cell
membrane egress, premature rupture phenotype requires activity 
a parasite host cell cysteine protease. complementation sera5 null
parasites ectopic expression wild-type sera5 reversed egress defect,
whereas expression sera5 mutant refractory processing failed rescue
the phenotype. findings implicate sera5 important regulator the
kinetics efficiency egress suggest proteolytic modification is
required sera5 function. addition, study reveals efficient egress
requires tight control timing membrane rupture.
