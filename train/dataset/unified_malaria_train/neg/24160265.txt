background: construction plasmid vectors transgene expression the
malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, presents major technical hurdles.
traditional molecular cloning restriction ligation often yields deletions 
and re-arrangements assembling low-complexity (a + t)-rich parasite dna.
furthermore, use large 5'- 3'- untranslated regions dna sequence
(utrs) drive transgene transcription limits number expression cassettes
that incorporated plasmid vectors.
methods: address challenges, two high fidelity cloning strategies,
namely yeast homologous recombination gibson assembly method, were
evaluated constructing p. falciparum vectors. additionally, general
rules reliably using viral 2a-like peptide express multiple proteins
from single expression cassette preserving proper trafficking to
various subcellular compartments assessed.
results: yeast homologous recombination gibson assembly found be
effective strategies successfully constructing p. falciparum plasmid vectors.
using cloning methods, validated family expression vectors that
provide flexible starting point user-specific applications created.
these vectors also compatible traditional cloning restriction and
ligation, contain useful combinations commonly used features enhancing
plasmid segregation site-specific integration p. falciparum. additionally,
application 2a-like peptide synthesis multiple proteins a
single expression cassette, rules combinatorially directing proteins
to discrete subcellular compartments established.
conclusions: set freely available, sequence-verified functionally
validated parts offer greater flexibility constructing p. falciparum
vectors expanded expression capacity provided.
