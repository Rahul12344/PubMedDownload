metabolic resistance pyrethroid insecticides widespread anopheles
mosquitoes major threat malaria control. dna markers would aid
predictive monitoring resistance, mutations discovered
outside insecticide-targeted genes. isofemale family pools wild ugandan
anopheles gambiae population, area operational pyrethroid failure
is suspected, genotyped using candidate-gene enriched snp array.
resistance-associated snps detected three genes detoxification
superfamilies, addition insecticide target site (the voltage gated
sodium channel gene, vgsc). putative associations confirmed two of
the marker snps, p450 cyp4j5 esterase coeae1d reproducible
association pyrethroid resistance multiple field collections uganda 
and kenya, together vgsc-1014s (kdr) mutation snps explained
around 20% variation resistance. moreover, >20 mb 2la inversion also
showed evidence association resistance environmental humidity.
sequencing cyp4j5 coeae1d detected resistance-linked loss diversity,
suggesting selection standing variation. study provides novel,
regionally-validated dna assays resistance important insecticide 
class, establishes 2la karyotype variation humidity common
factors impacting resistance phenotype.
