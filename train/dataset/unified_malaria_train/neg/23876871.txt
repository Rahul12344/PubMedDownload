fe-s clusters ensembles sulphide-linked di-, tri-, tetra-iron centres 
of variety metalloproteins play important roles reduction and
oxidation mitochondrial electron transport, energy metabolism, regulation of
gene expression, cell survival, nitrogen fixation, numerous metabolic
pathways. fe-s clusters assembled one four distinct systems: nif,
suf, isc, cia machineries. isc machinery house-keeping system
conserved widely prokaryotes higher eukaryotes, systems
are present limited range organisms play supplementary roles under
certain conditions stress. fe-s cluster-containing proteins the
components required fe-s cluster biosynthesis modulated stress
conditions, drug resistance, developmental stages. also known a
defect fe-s proteins fe-s cluster biogenesis leads many genetic
disorders humans, indicates importance systems. this
review, describe biological physiological significance fe-s
cluster-containing proteins biosynthesis parasitic protozoa
including plasmodium, trypanosoma, leishmania, giardia, trichomonas, entamoeba,
cryptosporidium, blastocystis, microsporidia. also discuss roles of
fe-s cluster biosynthesis proliferation, differentiation, stress response 
in protozoan parasites. heterogeneity systems the
compartmentalization fe-s cluster biogenesis protozoan parasites likely
reflect divergent evolution highly diverse environmental niches, and
influence parasitic lifestyle pathogenesis. finally, fe-s
cluster-containing proteins biosynthetic machinery protozoan
parasites remarkably different mammalian hosts. thus,
they represent rational target development novel chemotherapeutic
and prophylactic agents protozoan infections.
