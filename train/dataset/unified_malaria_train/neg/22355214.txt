the onset, severity, ultimate outcome malaria infection influenced 
parasite-expressed virulence factors well individual host responses to
these determinants. humans mice, liver injury follows parasite entry,
persisting erythrocytic stage case infection fatal
strain plasmodium falciparum. hepatic nuclear factor (hnf)-1α master
regulator liver damage adaptive responses also diverse
metabolic functions. study, analyzed expression host hnf-1α 
relation malaria infection evaluated interaction the
5'-untranslated region subtilisin-like protease 2 (subtilase, sub2).
recombinant human hnf-1α expressed lentiviral vector (lv hnf-1α) was
introduced mice. interestingly, differences activity the
5'-untranslated region pf-sub2 promoter detected 293t cells, and
lv hnf-1α observed influence promoter activity, suggesting host
hnf-1α interacts sub2 gene.
