background: delayed parasite clearance and, consequently, reduced efficacy of
artemisinin-based combination therapies linked plasmodium
falciparum k13 gene snps southeast asia. africa, significantly prolonged
clearance yet observed presently restricted variation in
parasite clearance cannot explained k13 polymorphisms.
objectives: aim study vivo pfk13 transcriptional response in
patients treated artemether-lumefantrine explore whether pfk13
transcripts explain patients' parasite clearance outcomes.
patients methods: total 47 tanzanian children microscopically
confirmed uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria hospitalized received
artemether-lumefantrine treatment (clinical trial id: nct00336375). rna was
extracted venous blood samples collected treatment initiation 
five timepoints treatment. cdna synthesized pfk13 transcripts 
measured real-time pcr.
results: wide range pfk13 transcript variation observed throughout all
timepoints artemether-lumefantrine treatment. taking parasite clearance
data together pfk13 transcripts profile, observed negative
correlation inferring pfk13 down-regulation associated longer
parasite clearance time.
conclusions: findings suggest reduced pfk13 transcriptional response
may represent first step towards artemisinin tolerance/resistance.
