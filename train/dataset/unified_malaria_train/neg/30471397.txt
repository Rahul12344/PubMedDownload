the aim present study chemical clarification vitro peyer's
patch-immunomodulating polysaccharides sugar cane molasses, evaluation 
in vivo modulating activity immune function lymphocytes peyer's
patches microenvironment hemopoietic system. five kinds glucans,
comprising dextranase-sensitive activity-related d-glucosyl moieties, were
purified vitro peyer's patch-immunomodulating polysaccharides the
molasses. oral administration glucan-enriched subfraction induced il-2 and
gm-csf-producing lymphocytes peyer's patches, resulting enhancement of
il-6 production hemopoietic microenvironment boost neutrophil numbers 
the peripheral blood stream. oral administration purified glucan or
glucan-enrich sub-fraction sugar cane reduced number plasmodium
berghei- p. yoelii-infected erythrocytes murine infection model, using
polysaccharide alone via co-administration antimalarial drug,
artesunate. results suggested peyer's patch-immunomodulating glucans
enhanced protective immunity axis peyer's patches-hemopoietic system.
