the burden plasmodium vivax malaria huge india, affecting large
population annually. recent reports p. vivax contributing severe illness
and death, makes vaccine research p. vivax malaria, high priority. extent of
sequence variation antigen coding genes known major hurdle in
vaccine initiatives malaria. serine repeat antigens plasmodium are
promising asexual blood stage vaccine candidates malaria been
implicated key role merozoite invasion egress. among p.
vivax sera proteins, sera4 sera5 major transcribed members in
erythrocytic stages, making encouraging candidates explored 
polymorphism vaccine potential. earlier reports suggest diversity in
these pvsera antigens localized c-terminal region proteins.
hence, genetic diversity study region seems prudent. moreover, there
are reports available india, present study aims investigate the
polymorphism c-terminal region two highly transcribed members pvsera4
and pvsera5 indian field isolates. result pvsera5 demonstrates
extensive genetic diversity, major deletions, insertions snps and
signifies gene positive selection. hand, high
sequence conservation seen pvsera4 c-terminal region indian field
isolates contrasting earlier report thailand have
shown diversity. research data showcased study greatly aid in
gaining better understanding antigenic variations, immune mediated selection
mechanisms functional significance two vivax proteins. this
study also makes striking contribution towards understanding antigenic
repertoire pvsera genes indian isolates.
