ticks salivate feeding hosts. saliva helps blood feeding through
host anti-hemostatic immunomodulatory components. previous transcriptomic and
proteomic studies revealed complexity tick saliva, comprising hundreds 
polypeptides grouped several multi-genic families lipocalins,
kunitz-domain containing peptides, metalloproteases, basic tail secreted
proteins, several families uniquely found ticks. studies also 
revealed composition saliva changes time; expression of
transcripts family wax wane function feeding time.
here, examined whether host immune factors could influence sialome switching
by comparing sialomes ticks fed naturally rabbit, ticks artificially
fed defibrinated blood depleted immune components. previous studies were
based transcriptomes derived pools several individuals. get an
insight uniqueness tick sialomes, performed transcriptomic
analyses single salivary glands dissected individual adult female i.
ricinus ticks. multivariate analysis identified 1,279 contigs differentially
expressed function time and/or feeding mode. cluster analysis these
contigs revealed nine clusters differentially expressed genes, four which
appeared consistently across several replicates, five clusters were
idiosyncratic, pointing uniqueness sialomes individual ticks. the
disclosure tick quantum sialomes reveals unique salivary composition
produced individual ticks switch sialomes throughout blood
meal, possible mechanism immune evasion.
