background: plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens elicit antibody responses in
malaria-endemic populations, clinically protective, is
one reasons merozoite antigens focus malaria vaccine
development efforts. polymorphisms several merozoite antigen-encoding genes
are thought arise result selection human immune system.
methods: allele frequency distribution 15 merozoite antigens a
two-year period, 2007 2008, examined parasites obtained children 
with uncomplicated malaria. population, allele frequency changes pre-
and post-anti-malarial treatment also examined. gene showed a
significant shift allele frequencies also assessed longitudinally in
asymptomatic complicated malaria infections.
results: fluctuating allele frequencies identified codons 147 148 
reticulocyte-binding homologue (rh) 5, shift hd yh haplotypes over
the two-year period uncomplicated malaria infections. however, the
asymptomatic complicated malaria infections yh dominant stable
haplotype two-year ten-year periods, respectively. logistic
regression analysis three malaria infection populations 2007 and
2009 revealed, chance infected hd haplotype decreased 
with time 2007 2009 increased uncomplicated asymptomatic
infections.
conclusion: rh5 codons 147 148 showed heterogeneity individual and
population level may degree immune selection.
