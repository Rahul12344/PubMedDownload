darc thought act key invasion receptor p. vivax malaria. is
known expression darc susceptibility p. vivax malaria is
influenced presence specific darc genotypes. studies reported 
low probability p. vivax malaria individuals carrying fya allele due the
significantly reduced binding p. vivax duffy binding protein. no
association allele frequency severe vivax malaria epidemiology has
been yet established country. present study, high level of
heterozygotes observed statistically significant deviation the
h-w equilibrium group complicated malaria; indicative of
demographic disequilibrium. significantly upregulated expression darc
receptor fya/fyb heterozygote patients suggestive greater receptor
repertoire responsible possible variation parasite ligand binding 
with host receptor thus might role play severe malaria.
