background: folate pathway enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt)
converts serine glycine 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate essential
for acquisition one-carbon units subsequent transfer reactions.
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate used thymidylate synthase convert dump to
dtmp dna synthesis. plasmodium falciparum enzymatically functional shmt
(pfshmtc) related, apparently inactive isoform (pfshmtm) found, encoded
by different genes. here, patterns localization two isoforms the
parasite erythrocytic cycle investigated.
methods: polyclonal antibodies raised pfshmtc pfshmtm, and, together 
with specific markers mitochondrion apicoplast, employed in
quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy blood-stage parasites.
results: well expected cytoplasmic occupancy pfshmtc all
stages, localization mitochondrion apicoplast occurred a
stage-specific manner. although early trophozoites lacked visible organellar
pfshmtc, significant percentage parasites showed fluorescence during
the mid-to-late trophozoite schizont stages. case the
mitochondrion, majority parasites stages given time showed
no marked pfshmtc fluorescence, suggesting occupancy organelle
is limited duration. pfshmtm showed distinctly pronounced mitochondrial
location erythrocytic cycle gfp-tagging n-terminal
region confirmed predicted presence mitochondrial signal sequence.
within apicoplast, majority mitotic schizonts showed marked
concentration pfshmtc, whose localization organelle less
restricted mitochondrion persisted late trophozoite 
the post-mitotic stages. pfshmtm showed broadly similar distribution across the
cycle, distinctive punctate accumulation towards ends of
elongating apicoplasts. late post-mitotic schizonts, pfshmtc and
pfshmtm concentrated central region parasite becomes 
residual body erythrocyte lysis merozoite release.
conclusions: pfshmtc pfshmtm show dynamic, stage-dependent localization 
among different compartments parasite sequence analysis suggests
they may also reversibly associate other, factor may critical
to folate cofactor function, given apparent lack enzymic activity of
pfshmtm.
