background: hyperuricemia associated cardio-metabolic disorders more
prevalent african americans european americans. used genome-wide
admixture mapping association testing identify loci ancestry effects 
on serum uric acid levels.
methods: analyzed 1,976 african americans washington, d.c, including
1,322 individuals 328 pedigrees 654 unrelated individuals, enrolled in
the howard university family study. performed admixture mapping and
genome-wide association testing using ~800 k autosomal single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps). performed fine mapping dense genotyping. assessed 
functionality combination bioinformatic annotation, reporter gene assays,
and gel shift experiments. also analyzed 12,641 individuals enrolled the
national health nutrition examination survey.
results: detected genome-wide significant locus chromosome 11p15.4 at
which serum uric acid levels increased increasing african ancestry,
independent kidney function. fine-mapping identified two independent signals
in β-globin locus. ancestral allele snp rs2855126, located upstream of
the hemoglobin, gamma gene hbg1, associated increased serum uric acid 
levels higher expression reporter gene relative derived allele.
hyperuricemia associated increased risk hypertension 3,767 african
americans (odds ratio = 2.48, p = 2.71 × 10(-19)).
conclusions: given increased expression γ-globin leads increased
levels fetal hemoglobin confers protection malaria, we
hypothesize evolution africa protection malaria may have
occurred cost increased serum uric acid levels, contributing the
high rates hyperuricemia associated cardio-metabolic disorders observed in
african americans.
