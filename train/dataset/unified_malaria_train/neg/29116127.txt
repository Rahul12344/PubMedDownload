deletions plasmodium falciparum hrp2 hrp3 genes affect the
performance hrp2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts). deletions
have reported south america, india eritrea. whether parasites
are widespread east africa unknown. total 274 samples from
asymptomatic children mbita, western kenya, 61 genomic  data kilifi, 
eastern kenya, available analysis. pcr-confirmed samples were
investigated presence pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes. samples with
evidence deletion, parasite presence confirmed amplifying three
independent genes. failed amplify pfhrp2 25 131 (19.1%)
pcr-confirmed samples. these, 8 (10%) samples microscopic positive
and classified pfhrp2-deleted. eight microscopically-confirmed
pfhrp2-deleted samples intact pfhrp3 locus positive hrp2-based rdt. 
in addition, one pcr-confirmed infection showed deletion pfhrp3 locus.
one genomic sample lacked pfhrp2 one lacked pfhrp3. sample harbored
parasites lacking genes. parasites lacking pfhrp2 present kenya, 
may detectable hrp-based rdt higher parasitaemia, possibly due the
presence intact pfhrp3. findings warrant systematic study to
establish prevalence diagnostic significance.
