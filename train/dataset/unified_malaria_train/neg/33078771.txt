the highly sensitive selective determination escherichia coli (e. coli) in
urine achieved using sybr™ safe loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(lamp) method distance-based paper device. new primers set specific to
multi-copy 16s rrna gene e. coli designed used study. the
detection sensitivity primers higher related work they
could incorporated low-cost paper-based device quantify e. coli in
urine concentration lower 101 cfu ml-1. regarding standard artificial
urine, linear range 10-fold dilution e. coli concentration (105-100 cfu
ml-1) r-square value (r2) = 0.9823 observed directly using a
fluorescent migratory distance 4 μl reaction mixture detection zone
under blue light without need postreaction staining process. based the
device, e. coli infection could significantly categorized 3 groups; none,
light, heavy levels, beneficial uti diagnosis. hence, this
paper-based device suitable use sybr™ safe-lamp assay to
semi-quantify e. coli, especially resource-limited settings due advantages 
of low cost, simple fabrication operation, requirement for
sophisticated instruments, well disposability portability.
