plasmodium falciparum causative agent human malaria. sixty percent of
mrnas extremely at-rich (81%) genome harbor long polyadenosine (polya)
runs within orfs, distinguishing parasite hosts other
sequenced organisms. recent studies indicate polya runs cause ribosome stalling
and frameshifting, triggering mrna surveillance pathways attenuating protein 
synthesis. here, show p. falciparum exception rule. we
demonstrate endogenous genes reporter sequences containing long
polya runs efficiently accurately translated p. falciparum cells. we
show polya runs elicit response go decay (ngd) result 
in production frameshifted proteins. stark contrast 
observe human cells t. thermophila, organism similar at-content.
finally, using stalling reporters show plasmodium cells evolved to
have fully functional ngd pathway.
