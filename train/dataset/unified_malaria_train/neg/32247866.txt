vector-borne pathogens (vbps) pose great risk ruminant production through
significant economic losses. several previous studies thailand mainly
been focused health dairy beef cattle. water buffaloes one of
the important ruminants country, studies infection vbps 
remains limited. conducted molecular survey blood samples 456
buffaloes obtained eight provinces across different geographical locations
of thailand. pcr diagnostics indicated 116 (25.4%) 59 (12.9%) of
these 456 samples positive piroplasm plasmodium spp., respectively, 
and found six eight regions, respectively, across thailand.
co-infections piroplasm plasmodium spp. observed 24 cases (5.26%).
babesia spp. detected 12 sequenced piroplasm-positive
samples present study. genetic comparisons phylogenetic analyses of
within parasite populations, based 18s ribosomal (r)rna and
cytochrome b (cytb) genes t. orientalis p. bubalis, respectively,
revealed t. orientalis shared high similarity within population and
could divided four distinct haplotypes. haplotypes 1 4 placed in
the clade samples previously isolated cattle korea, japan, 
australia, usa. haplotypes 2, 3 novel placed a
separate clade shared isolates. also confirmed previous
investigation least three cytb haplotypes p. bubalis distributed 
in country relatively high degree genetic polymorphisms within 
population (based cytb sequences). type ii p. bubalis phylogenetically
closely related p. caprae goats zambia thailand. study improves
our current understanding distribution, intra- inter-population
genetic diversity, genetic relationship piroplasms plasmodium spp.
