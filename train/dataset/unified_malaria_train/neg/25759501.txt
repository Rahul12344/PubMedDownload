one unique feature malaria parasites differential transcription of
structurally distinct rrna (rrna) genes different developmental stages: the
a-type genes transcribed mainly asexual stages, whereas s-type genes
are expressed mostly sexual mosquito stages. conclusive functional evidence
of different rrnas regulating stage-specific parasite development, however, is
still absent. performed genetic crosses plasmodium yoelii parasites
with one parent oocyst development defect (odd) phenotype another
producing normal oocysts identify gene(s) contributing odd. the
parent odd--characterized small oocysts lacking infective
sporozoites--was obtained introduction plasmid green
fluorescent protein gene parasite genome subsequent passages in
mice. quantitative trait locus analysis genome-wide microsatellite genotypes
of 48 progeny crosses linked ~200-kb segment chromosome 6
containing one s-type genes (d-type small subunit rrna gene [d-ssu]) to
the odd. fine mapping plasmid integration site, gene expression pattern,
and gene knockout experiments demonstrated disruption d-ssu gene
caused odd phenotype. interestingly, introduction d-ssu gene 
same parasite strain (self), different subspecies, significantly
affected completely ablated oocyst development, suggesting stage- and
subspecies (strain)-specific regulation oocyst development d-ssu. this
study demonstrates p. yoelii d-ssu essential normal oocyst and
sporozoite development variation d-ssu sequence dramatic
effects parasite development.importance: malaria parasites known 
organisms express structurally distinct rrna genes different
developmental stages. differential expression genes suggests that
they play unique roles complex life cycle parasites. conclusive
functional proof different rrnas regulating parasite development, however, 
is still absent controversial. functionally demonstrate first 
time stage-specifically expressed d-type small-subunit rrna gene (d-ssu)
is essential oocyst development malaria parasite plasmodium yoelii 
the mosquito. study also shows variations d-ssu sequence and/or 
timing transcription may profound effects parasite oocyst development.
the results show addition protein translation, rrnas malaria
parasites also regulate parasite development differentiation a
strain-specific manner, explored controlling parasite
transmission.
