antimalarial drug resistance historically arisen convergent de novo
mutations plasmodium falciparum parasite populations southeast asia and
south america. past decade southeast asia, artemisinins, core
component first-line antimalarial therapies, experienced delayed parasite
clearance associated several pfk13 mutations, primarily c580y. report
that mutant pfk13 emerged independently guyana, genome analysis
indicating evolutionary origin distinct southeast asia. pfk13 c580y
parasites observed 1.6% (14/854) samples collected guyana in
2016-2017. introducing pfk13 c580y r539t mutations gene editing local 
parasites conferred high levels vitro artemisinin resistance. vitro
growth competition assays revealed fitness cost associated pfk13
variants, potentially explaining resistance alleles increased 
in frequency quickly south america. data place local malaria
control efforts risk guiana shield.

plain-language-summary: recommended treatments malaria include drug
called artemisinin derivatives. however, concerns that
plasmodium falciparum, parasite causes cases malaria, will
eventually develop widespread resistance drug. strain p. falciparum
partially resistant artemisinin seen cambodia 2008, since
spread across southeast asia. resistance appears frequently linked a
mutation known pfk13 c580y. southeast asia amazonia considered be
hotspots antimalarial drug resistance, pfk13 c580y mutation was
detected south american country guyana 2010. examine whether 
mutation still circulating part world, mathieu et al.
collected analyzed 854 samples across guyana 2016 2017. overall, 
1.6% samples pfk13 c580y mutation, number high 
8.8% one region. analyses revealed mutation guyana not
spread southeast asia, occurred amazonia independently.
to better understand impact pfk13 c580y mutation, mathieu et al.
introduced genetic change non-resistant parasites country
neighbouring guyana. expected, mutation made p. falciparum highly
resistant artemisinin, also slowed growth rate parasite.
this disadvantage may explain mutation spread rapidly
through guyana recent years. artemisinin derivatives always
associated antimalarial drugs slow development resistance;
there concerns reduced susceptibility artemisinin leads the
parasites becoming resistant partner drugs. research needed 
evaluate pfk13 c580y mutation affects parasite’s response the
typical combination drugs given patients.
