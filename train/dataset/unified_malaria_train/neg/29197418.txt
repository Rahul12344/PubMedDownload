background: plasmodium falciparum deadliest malaria parasite. currently,
there seldom commercial antibodies p. falciparum proteins, which
greatly limits study plasmodium. crispr/cas9 efficient genome
editing method, employed various organisms. however, use of
this technique p. falciparum still limited gene knockout, site-specific 
mutation generation green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter line with
disruption inserted sites.
results: adapted crispr/cas9 system add commercial tag sequences
to endogenous genes p. falciparum. add ha ha-ty1 tags ck2β1, ck2α and
stk, pl6cs-hdhfr-ck2β1/ck2α/stk constructed, contained sequences of
tags, specific homologous arms, sgrna. p. falciparum 3d7 strain was
subsequently transfected puf1-bsd-cas9 pl6cs-hdhfr-ck2β1/ck2α/stk
plasmids via electroporation. that, bsd wr99210 drugs added the
culture screen parasites containing plasmids. twenty days after
electroporation, live parasites appeared collected check tagging 
by pcr, dna sequencing, western blotting immuno-fluorescence assays. the
results showed tags successfully integrated c-terminus 
these three proteins.
conclusions: improved method integrate tags plasmodium
falciparum genes using crispr/cas9 method, lays foundation for
further study plasmodium falciparum molecular level.
