background: malaria surveillance requires powerful tools strategies to
achieve malaria elimination. rapid diagnostic tests malaria (rdts) easily
deployed large scale helpful sources parasite dna. the
application sensitive molecular techniques rdts modern tool 
improving malaria case detection drug resistance surveillance. several
studies made possible extract dna plasmodium falciparum from
rdts. knowledge gametocyte carriage population important to
better assess level parasite transmission elimination settings. aim
of study detect p. falciparum gametocytes used rdts by
quantitative pcr molecular monitoring malaria transmission.
methods: dna extracted 303 rdt devices (sd bioline malaria pf) using the
chelex-100 protocol. qpcr performed 20 μl reaction detect and
quantify transcripts pfs25 gene. cycle threshold (ct) determined
by emission fluorescence corresponding initial amount amplified
dna.
results: study found overall prevalence 53.47% average ct of
32.12 ± 4.28 cycles. 2018, prevalence gametocytes higher the
ranérou district (76.24%) saint-louis district (67.33%) an
increase number gametocyte carriers 2018 noted, comparison
with 2017.
conclusions: rdts good source dna molecular monitoring gametocyte
carriage. method simple effective tool better understand the
level malaria transmission view elimination.
