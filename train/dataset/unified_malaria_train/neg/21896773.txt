one solutions reducing global mortality morbidity due to
malaria multivalent vaccines comprising antigens several life cycle stages 
of malarial parasite. hence, need supplementing current
set malaria vaccine candidate antigens. here, aimed characterize
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored micronemal antigen (gama) encoded 
the pf08_0008 gene plasmodium falciparum. antibodies raised against
recombinant gama synthesized using wheat germ cell-free system.
immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated first time gama a
microneme protein merozoite. erythrocyte binding assays revealed gama
possesses erythrocyte binding epitope c-terminal region binds 
nonsialylated protein receptor human erythrocytes. growth inhibition assays
revealed anti-gama antibodies inhibit p. falciparum invasion a
dose-dependent manner gama plays role sialic acid (sa)-independent
invasion pathway. anti-gama antibodies combination anti-erythrocyte
binding antigen 175 exhibited significantly higher level invasion
inhibition, supporting rationale targeting sa-dependent and
sa-independent ligands/pathways better targeting either alone.
human sera collected areas malaria endemicity mali thailand
recognized gama. since gama p. falciparum refractory gene knockout
attempts, essential parasite invasion. overall, study indicates that
gama novel blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen.
