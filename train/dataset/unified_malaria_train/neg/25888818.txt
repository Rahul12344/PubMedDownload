background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) detecting histidine-rich protein 2
(pfhrp2) antigen used identify individuals plasmodium falciparum
infection even low transmission settings seeking achieve elimination.
however, rdts lack sensitivity detect low-density infections, produce
false negatives p. falciparum strains lacking pfhrp2 gene detect
species p. falciparum.
methods: results pfhrp2-based rdt plasmodium nested pcr compared in
a region declining malaria transmission southern zambia using samples 
community-based, cross-sectional surveys 2008 2012. participants were
tested pfhrp2-based rdt finger prick blood sample spotted onto
filter paper pcr analysis used prepare blood smears microscopy.
species-specific, real-time, quantitative pcr (q-pcr) performed samples
that tested positive either microscopy, rdt nested pcr.
results: 3,292 total participants enrolled, 12 (0.4%) tested positive by
microscopy 42 (1.3%) rdt. 3,213 (98%) samples tested nested pcr, 57 
(1.8%) positive, resulting 87 participants positive least one of
the three tests. these, 61 tested positive p. falciparum q-pcr with
copy numbers ≤ 2 x 10(3) copies/μl, 5 positive p. falciparum and
plasmodium malariae 2 positive p. malariae alone. rdt detected 32
(53%) p. falciparum positives, failing detect three dual infections 
with p. malariae. among 2,975 participants enrolled low transmission
period 2009 2012, sensitivity pfhrp2-based rdt compared to
nested pcr 17%, specificity >99%. pfhrp gene detected in
80% p. falciparum positives; however, comparison copy number rdt
negative rdt positive samples suggested rdt negatives resulted low 
parasitaemia pfhrp2 gene deletion.
conclusions: low-density p. falciparum infections identified currently
used pfhrp2-based rdts inability detect non-falciparum malaria will
hinder progress reduce malaria low transmission settings zambia.
more sensitive specific diagnostic tests likely necessary identify
parasite reservoirs achieve malaria elimination.
