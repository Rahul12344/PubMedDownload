c57bl/6 mice widely used vivo studies immune function and
metabolism mammals. previous study, observed c57bl/6
mice purchased different vendors infected plasmodium yoelii, a
causative agent murine malaria, exhibited differential immune
responses significantly different parasite burdens: patterns were
reproducible gut contents transplanted gnotobiotic mice. gain
insight mechanism resistance, removed whole ceca mice
purchased two vendors, taconic biosciences (low parasitemia) charles
river laboratories (high parasitemia), determine combined host and
microflora metabolome metatranscriptome. exception two charles
river samples, observed ≥90% similarity overall bacterial gene expression
within vendors ≤80% similarity vendors. total 33 bacterial genes
were differentially expressed charles river mice (p-value < 0.05) relative 
the mice purchased taconic. included among these, flic, ureabc, six
members nuo gene family overrepresented microbiomes susceptible to
more severe malaria. moreover, 38 mouse genes differentially expressed in
these purported genetically identical mice. differentially expressed genes
included basigin, cell surface receptor required p. falciparum invasion 
red blood cells. differences metabolite pools detected, though their
relevance malaria infection, microbial community activity, host response is
not yet understood. data provided new targets may connect gut
microbial activity malaria resistance susceptibility phenotypes the
c57bl/6 model organism.
