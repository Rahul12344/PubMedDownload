ten countries reported pfhrp2/pfhrp3 gene deletions since first
observation pfhrp2-deleted parasites 2012. previous study (watson et
al., 2017), characterised drivers selecting pfhrp2/3 deletions and
mapped regions africa greatest selection pressure. february
2018, world health organization issued guidance investigating suspected
false-negative rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) due pfhrp2/3 deletions. however, 
no guidance provided regarding timing investigations. failure to
consider seasonal variation could cause premature decisions switch to
alternative rdts. response, extended methods predict 
prevalence false-negative rdts due pfhrp2/3 deletions highest when
sampling younger individuals beginning rainy season. we
conclude producing map regions impacted seasonal fluctuations in
pfhrp2/3 deletions database identifying optimum sampling intervals to
support malaria control programmes.
