infravec: research capacity implementation genetic control of
mosquitoes.

crisanti a.

mosquitoes represent major global cause human suffering due the
diseases transmit. include parasitic diseases, i.e. malaria and
filariasis, viral infections dengue, encephalitis, yellow fever. 
the threat mosquito-borne diseases limited tropical subtropical 
regions world. trade climate changes opened new niches to
tropical vectors temperate areas world, thus putting previously
unaffected regions risk disease transmission. notable example is
the spread aedes species, particularly asian tiger mosquito aedes
albopictus southern europe (reviewed ref. 1). endogenous cases of
vector-borne diseases including west nile fever, chikungunya, dengue are
frequently reported, highlighting increased risk tropical diseases
for european population. typically, vector control measures targetting
mosquitoes cases carried use insecticides. approach 
has number limitations constrain effectiveness. lack of
resources, inadequate logistics, insurgence insecticide resistance are
some problems encountered disease-endemic countries (decs). more
recently africa, widespread use insecticide-treated bed nets caused
a dramatic reduction malaria mortality morbidity. bed nets however a
temporary solution, testimony failure implement area-wide control
measures aimed eradicating malaria. us europe, well-developed
economies, also failed control spread mosquito vectors,
particularly aedes species. alarming situation clearly speaks need
to expand knowledge mosquito vectors urgency developing and
validating novel biological genetic control measures overcome the
limitations current insecticide-based approaches. last 10 years,
significant advances made understanding biology, genetics,
and ecology anopheles aedes mosquitoes paralleled development
of new molecular tools investigating gene function mosquito ability to
transmit parasite viral diseases. offer compelling opportunity to
design validate new genetic vector control measures. size the
complexity undertaking require high level capacity, effort, and
technological platforms. laboratory--or even institution--has resources,
the infrastructure capacity, expertise accomplish task alone.
infravec addresses need scientific community share facilities and
integrate cutting-edge knowledge technologies readily accessible
but nevertheless critical exploit genetic genomic information the
effort control mosquito-borne diseases. objective provide
laboratories currently operate individually limited coordination and
little sharing technologies, collective research capacity the
laboratories forming core project infrastructure. infravec provided
resources 31 institutions european african countries enhance
collaborative links, execute joint research activity, importantly 
enable individual researchers (from phd students established academics) to
carry complex experimental activities assigning research packages or
‘infrastructure access’ executed laboratory facilities and
infrastructures infravec. report overall activities infravec 
and impact scientific community purpose initiate a
dialogue stakeholders future evolution.
