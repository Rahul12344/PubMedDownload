bioassays molecular diagnostics routinely used monitoring of
malaria vector populations support insecticide resistance management (irm),
guiding operational decisions insecticides ought used for
effective vector control. previously developed taqman assays optimised to
distinguish wild-type l1014 knockdown resistance (kdr) point
mutations 1014f 1014s (triplex reaction), n1575 wild-type the
point mutation 1575y (duplex reaction). subsequently, artificial pools of
anopheles gambiae (an. gambiae) specimens known genotypes l1014f, l1014s,
and n1575y created, nucleic acids extracted, kdr mutations were
detected. data used define linear regression model that
predicts allelic frequency within pool mosquitoes function the
measured δct values (ct mutant - ct wild type probe). polynomial regression
models showed r2 values >0.99 (p < 0.05). method validated with
populations variable allelic frequencies, found precise
(1.66⁻2.99%), accurate (3.3⁻5.9%), able detect single heterozygous
mosquito mixed 9 wild type individuals pool 10. pilot
application field-caught samples showed minimal differences individual
genotyping (0.36⁻4.0%). allowed first detection super-kdr mutation 
n1575y an. gambiae mali. using pools instead individuals allows for
more efficient resistance allele screening, facilitating irm.
