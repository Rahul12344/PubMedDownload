in plasmodium falciparum infections parasite transmission stages, the
gametocytes, mature 10 days sequestered internal organs. recent studies
suggest cell mechanical properties rather adhesive interactions play 
role sequestration gametocyte maturation. remains instead obscure
how sequestration established, earliest sexual stages,
morphologically similar asexual trophozoites, modify infected erythrocytes
and cytoadhesive properties onset gametocytogenesis. here,
purified p. falciparum early gametocytes used ultrastructurally and
biochemically analyse parasite-induced modifications red blood cell
surface measure functional consequences adhesion human
endothelial cells. work revealed stage gametocytes able deform
the infected erythrocytes like asexual parasites, modify surface
with adhesive 'knob' structures associated proteins. reduced levels p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) adhesins exposed the
red blood cell surface parasites, expression var gene
family, encodes 50-60 variants pfemp1, dramatically downregulated 
the transition asexual development gametocytogenesis. cytoadhesion assays
show gene expression changes host cell surface modifications
functionally result inability stage gametocytes bind host
ligands used asexual parasite bind endothelial cells. conclusion,
these results identify specific differences molecular cellular mechanisms 
of host cell remodelling adhesive properties, leading clearly distinct 
host parasite interplays establishment sequestration stage i
gametocytes asexual trophozoites.
