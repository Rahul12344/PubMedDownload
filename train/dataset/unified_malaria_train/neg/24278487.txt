background: plasmodium vivax prevalent human malaria parasite,
causing serious public health problems malaria-endemic countries. until
recently duffy-negative blood group phenotype considered confer
resistance vivax malaria african ethnicities. others have
reported p. vivax strains african countries madagascar mauritania
display capacity cause clinical vivax malaria duffy-negative people. new
insights must explain duffy-independent p. vivax invasion human
erythrocytes.
methods/principal findings: recent whole genome sequencing obtained ≥ 
70× coverage p. vivax genome five field-isolates, resulting ≥ 93% 
of sal reference sequenced coverage greater 20×. combined with
sequences one additional malagasy field isolate five monkey-adapted
strains, describe identification dna sequence rearrangements p.
vivax genome, including discovery duplication p. vivax duffy binding 
protein (pvdbp) gene. survey malagasy patients infected p. vivax showed
that pvdbp duplication present numerous locations madagascar and
found 50% infected patients evaluated. extended geographic surveys
showed pvdbp duplication detected frequently vivax patients
living east africa residents non-african p. vivax-endemic
countries. additionally, pvdbp duplication observed travelers seeking 
treatment vivax malaria upon returning home. pvdbp duplication prevalence 
highest west-central madagascar sites highest frequencies p.
vivax-infected, duffy-negative people reported.
conclusions/significance: highly conserved nature sequence involved in
the pvdbp duplication suggests occurred recent evolutionary time
frame. data suggest pvdbp, merozoite surface protein involved red
cell adhesion rapidly evolving, possibly response constraints imposed by
erythrocyte duffy negativity human populations.
