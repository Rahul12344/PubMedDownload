the transmission malaria parasites depends presence sexual stages
(gametocytes) blood, making ratio densities female male
gametocytes important determinants parasite fitness. manuscript describes
the development reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) assays to
separately quantify mature female male gametocytes human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, reveals pfs25 mrna expressed 
female gametocytes. female (pfs25) male (pfs230p) gametocyte specific
rt-qpcr assays lower detection limits 0.3 female 1.8 male gametocytes
per microlitre blood, respectively, making sensitive than
microscopy. accurate quantification ratio densities female male
gametocytes increase understanding p. falciparum transmission improve
the evaluation transmission blocking interventions.
