allatostatin type receptors (ast-ars) group g-protein coupled
receptors activated members fgl-amide (ast-a) peptide family that
inhibit food intake development arthropods. despite physiological
importance evolution ast-a system poorly described relatively
few receptors isolated functionally characterised insects. the
present study provides comprehensive analysis origin comparative
evolution ast-a system. determine evolution feeding modified
the function ast-ar duplicate receptors anopheles mosquitoes, were
characterised. phylogeny gene synteny suggested invertebrate ast-a
receptors peptide genes shared common evolutionary origin kiss/gal
receptors ligands. ast-ars kissr emerged common gene ancestor
after divergence galrs bilaterian genome. arthropods, ast-a 
system evolved lineage-specific events maintenance two
receptors flies mosquitoes (diptera) result gene
duplication event. speciation anopheles mosquitoes affected receptor gene
organisation characterisation ast-ar duplicates (gprals1 2) revealed
that common insects, mosquito receptors activated by
insect ast-a peptides ica2+-signalling pathway stimulated. gprals1
and 2 expressed mainly mosquito midgut ovaries transcript
abundance receptors modified feeding. blood meal strongly
up-regulated expression gprals midgut (p < 0.05) compared to
glucose fed females. based results hypothesise ast-a system in
insects shared common origin vertebrate kiss system may also share
a common function integrator metabolism reproduction.highlights:
ast-a kiss/gal receptors ligands shared common ancestry prior the
protostome-deuterostome divergence. phylogeny gene synteny revealed that
ast-ar kissr emerged galr gene divergence. ast-ar genes present in
the hemichordates lost chordates. protostomes, ast-ars
persisted evolved lineage-specific events duplicated the
arthropod radiation. diptera acquired maintained functionally divergent
duplicate ast-ar genes.
