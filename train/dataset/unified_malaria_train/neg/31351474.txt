background: development crispr/cas9 gene editing system generated 
new possibilities use gene drive constructs reduce suppress
mosquito populations levels support disease transmission. despite 
this prospect, social resistance genetically modified organisms remains high. 
gene drive open field research thus raises important questions regarding 
owed may consent research, could affected by
the proposed research, whose consent solicited. precise
circumstances informed consent must obtained, whom,
requires careful consideration. furthermore, appropriate engagement processes
should central introduction genetically modified mosquitos in
proposed target settings.
discussion: work, international guidance documents informed consent
and engagement reviewed applied genetically modified mosquito
research context. five analogous research endeavours involve area-wide /
open field experiments reviewed. approach respect the
solicitation individual informed consent community engagement are
highlighted.
conclusions: solicitation individual informed consent host
settings gene drive field trials may possible feasible some
instances, local community stakeholder engagement key building
trust towards proposed conduct research. regard, the
approaches taken investigators sponsors political science field
research weather modification field research avoided. rather,
proponents gene drive field research look eliminate dengue field
trials, cluster randomised trials, pragmatic clinical trials guidance
regarding solicitation individual informed consent host communities
ought managed, communities ought engaged.
