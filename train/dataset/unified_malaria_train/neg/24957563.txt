background: previous studies shown haemosporidian parasites
(haemoproteus (parahaemoproteus) plasmodium) infecting passerine birds have
an evolutionary history host switching little cospeciation, particular
at low taxonomic levels (e.g., family level), suggested the
main speciation mechanism group parasites. recent studies have
characterized diverse clades haemosporidian parasites (h. (haemoproteus) and
h. (parahaemoproteus)) infecting non-passerine birds (e.g., columbiformes,
pelecaniiformes). here, explore cospeciation history h. (haemoproteus) 
and h. (parahaemoproteus) parasites non-passerine hosts.
methods: sequenced mtdna cyt b gene haemosporidian parasites and
their avian non-passerine hosts. built bayesian phylogenetic hypotheses and
created concensus phylograms subsequently used conduct cospeciation 
analyses. used global cospeciation test, paco, event-cost
algorithm implemented core-pa.
results: global test suggests h. (haemoproteus) h.
(parahaemoproteus) parasites diversification history dominated by
cospeciation events particularly family level. host-parasite links from
the paco analysis show host switching events common within families
(i.e., among genera among species within genera), occasionally across
different orders (e.g., columbiformes pelecaniiformes). event-cost analyses
show haemosporidian coevolutionary history dominated host switching
and codivergence, duplication events also present. genetic lineages
unique raptor species (e.g., falc11) commonly switch falconiformes and
strigiformes.
conclusions: results corroborate previous findings detected a
global cospeciation signal family taxonomic level, also support a
history frequent switching closer tips host phylogeny, which
seems main diversification mechanism haemosporidians. dynamic
host-parasite associations relevant epidemiology emerging diseases 
because low parasite host specificity prerequisite emergence of
novel diseases. evidence host distributions suggests haemosporidian
parasites potential rapidly develop novel host-associations. this
pattern also recorded fish-monogenean interactions, suggesting a
general diversification mechanism parasites host choice not
restricted ecological barriers.
