plasmodium falciparum isolates china-myanmar border (cmb) experienced
regional special selective pressures adaptive evolution. however, genomes
of p. falciparum isolates region date poorly characterized.
herein, performed whole-genome sequencing 34 p. falciparum isolates from
cmb series genome-wide sequence analyses reveal genetic
diversity, population structures, comparisons isolates other
epidemic regions (thai-cambodia border, thai-myanmar border, west africa).
totally 59,720 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were
identified p. falciparum isolates cmb, average nucleotide
diversity (π = 4.59 × 10-4) ld decay (132 bp). tajima's fu li's
d values cmb isolates -0.8 (p < 0.05) -0.84 (p < 0.05),
respectively, suggesting demographic history recent population expansion 
purifying selection. moreover, 78 genes parasite identified that
could positive selection, including genes conferring drug
resistance pfubp1. addition, 33 snps identified tracing the
source parasites high accuracy analysis differential
snps among four epidemic regions. collectively, data demonstrated high
diversity cmb isolates' genomes forming distinct population, the
identification 33-snp barcode provides valuable surveillance parasite
migration among regions.
