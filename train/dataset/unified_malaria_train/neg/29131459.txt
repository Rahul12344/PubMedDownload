objective: interleukin-10 (il-10) anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by
th1 cells macrophages. rationale study examine and
validate possible contributions il-10 promoter polymorphisms sub-saharan
africa children infected either plasmodium falciparum schistosoma
haematobium children co-infected parasites.
materials methods: total 309 nigerian children aged 4-15 years were
recruited. study group consisted individuals infected either p.
falciparum (n = 76) s. haematobium (n = 94) mono-infections, group of
children co-infected p. falciparum s. haematobium (n = 62) and
matched healthy controls (n = 77). il-10 promoter polymorphisms -1082g/a,
-819c/t -592c/a genotyped direct sequencing.
results: frequencies il-10 -1082gg genotype, -1082g allele and
haplotype gcc (positions -1082, -819 -592) higher children infected
with p. falciparum healthy controls, indicating -1082gg genotype
and -1082g allele gcc haplotype associated increased
susceptibility malaria infection (or = 3.4, 95% ci = 1.2-10.8, p = 0.02; = 
2.5, 95% ci = 1.1-3.4, p = 0.02; = 3.8, 95% ci = 2.0-7.2, p = 0.0001,
respectively). children -1082gg genotype higher parasitaemia 
children -1082aa -1082ag genotypes (p = 0.0017). haplotype gcc
occurred frequently children infected s. haematobium, while
haplotype gta less frequent controls (or = 2.2, 95% ci = 1.2-4.4, p =
0.017 = 0.1, 95% ci = 0.02-0.5, p = 0.0004, respectively). differences 
in frequencies il-10 promoter polymorphisms observed children
with p. falciparum-s. haematobium co-infections healthy controls.
conclusion: although il-10 promoter polymorphisms associated p.
falciparum s. haematobium co-infection, variant -1082g/a haplotype gcc
are associated malaria, whereas il-10 haplotypes gcc gta are
associated schistosomiasis.
