biotrophic eukaryotic plant pathogens require living host growth 
form intimate haustorial interface parasitized cells. evolution to
biotrophy occurred independently fungal rusts powdery mildews, in
oomycete white rusts downy mildews. biotroph evolution molecular
mechanisms biotrophy poorly understood. proposed, not
shown, obligate biotrophy results (i) reduced selection maintenance
of biosynthetic pathways (ii) gain mechanisms evade host recognition or
suppress host defence. use illumina sequencing define genome,
transcriptome, gene models obligate biotroph oomycete arabidopsis
parasite, albugo laibachii. a. laibachii member chromalveolata, which
incorporates heterokonts (containing oomycetes), apicomplexa (which includes 
human parasites like plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii), four other
taxa. comparisons oomycete plant pathogens other
