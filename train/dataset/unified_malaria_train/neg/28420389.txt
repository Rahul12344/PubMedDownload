background: parasite resistance anti-malarials represents great obstacle for
malaria elimination. majority studies investigated association
between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) drug resistance; however, it
is becoming clear copy number variation (cnv) also associated with
this parasite phenotype. provide baseline molecular surveillance of
anti-malarial drug resistance brazilian amazon, present study
characterized genetic profile markers common genes
associated drug resistance plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax
isolates. additionally, data compared data published elsewhere
applying systematic review literature published 20-year time
period.
methods: genomic dna 67 patients infected p. falciparum p. vivax
from three brazilian states obtained 2002 2012. cnv p.
falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1 (pfmdr1), gtp cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1)
and p. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) assessed real-time pcr 
assays. snps pfmdr1 pfcrt genes assessed pcr-rflp. a
literature search studies analysed cnp genes p.
falciparum p. vivax conducted may 2014 march 2017 across four
databases.
results: analysed samples p. falciparum carried one copy pfmdr1 or
pfgch1. although pfcrt k76t polymorphism, determinant cq resistance, was
present samples genotyped, pfmdr1 n86y absent. p. vivax
isolates, amplification rate 20% found pvmdr1 gene. results
of study agreement low amplification rates pfmdr1 gene
evidenced americas africa, higher rates described in
southeast asia. p. vivax, low rates amplification pvmdr1 have
been described worldwide, exceptions french guiana, cambodia, thailand
and brazil.
conclusions: present study first evaluate gch1 cnv p.
falciparum isolates brazil, showing absence amplification gene
more 20 years withdrawal brazilian antifolates therapeutic 
scheme. furthermore, rate pvmdr1 amplification significantly higher
than previously reported isolates circulating northern brazil.
