anopheles mosquitoes vectors several human diseases including malaria.
in many malaria endemic areas, several species anopheles coexist, sometimes in
the form related sibling species morphologically indistinguishable.
determining size organization anopheles populations, possible
ongoing gene flow among important malaria control and, particular,
for monitoring spread insecticide resistance alleles. however, these
parameters difficult evaluate anopheles species due the
paucity genetic data available. here, assess extent contemporary
gene flow historical variations population size sequencing de novo 
assembling genomes wild-caught mosquitoes four species the
anopheles punctulatus group papua new guinea. analysis 50 mb 
of orthologous dna sequences revealed evidence contemporary gene flow among
these mosquitoes. addition, investigation demography two an. 
punctulatus species revealed distinct population histories. overall, analyses
suggest that, despite similarities morphology, behaviour ecology,
contemporary sympatric populations an. punctulatus evolving independently.
