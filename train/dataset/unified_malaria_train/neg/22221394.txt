background: emergence plasmodium falciparum resistance currently
used anti-malarial drugs major problem malaria control along the
thai-myanmar thai-cambodia borders. quinine (qn) with
tetracycline/doxycycline used second-line treatment for
uncomplicated falciparum malaria. addition, qn monotherapy the
first-line treatment falciparum malaria pregnant women. however, reduced
in vitro vivo responses qn reported. date, genetic
markers qn resistance proposed including plasmodium falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 
(pfmdr1), p. falciparum na+/h+ exchanger (pfnhe-1). study to
investigate role pfmdr1 pfnhe-1 gene vitro qn sensitivity in
thai isolates p. falciparum.
methods: eighty-five thai isolates p. falciparum thai-myanmar and
thai-cambodia borders 2003-2008 determined vitro qn sensitivity 
using radioisotopic assay. polymorphisms pfmdr1 pfnhe-1 gene were
determined pcr-rflp sequence analysis. associations vitro
qn sensitivity polymorphisms pfmdr1 pfnhe-1 gene were
evaluated.
results: mean qn ic50 202.8 nm (range 25.7-654.4 nm). four isolates 
were qn resistant ic50 >500 nm used cut-off point.
significant associations found pfmdr1 mutations codons n86y
and n1042d vitro qn sensitivity. however, associations number 
of dnnnd, ddnnndnhndd, nhndnhnnddd repeats microsatellite ms4760 of
the pfnhe-1 gene identified.
conclusion: data present study put doubt regarding pfnhe-1 gene as
to whether could used suitable marker qn resistance thailand.
in contrast, confirms influence pfmdr1 gene vitro qn
sensitivity.
