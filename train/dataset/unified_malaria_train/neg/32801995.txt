background: cerebral malaria (cm), reversible encephalopathy affecting young
children, medical emergency requiring rapid clinical assessment and
treatment. however, understanding genes/proteins biological
pathways involved disease outcome still limited.
methods: performed whole transcriptomic analysis blood samples 
malian children cm uncomplicated malaria (um). hierarchical clustering
and pathway, network, upstream regulator analyses performed explore
differentially expressed genes (degs). validated gene expression 8 genes
using real-time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr). plasma levels measured for
ip-10/cxcl10 il-18.
results: blood rna signature including 538 degs (∣fc | ≥2.0, adjusted p value ≤
0.01) allowed discriminate cm um. ingenuity pathway analysis (ipa)
and kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes (kegg) revealed novel genes and
biological pathways related immune/inflammatory responses, erythrocyte
alteration, neurodegenerative disorders. gene expressions cxcl10, il12rb2,
il18bp, il2ra, axin2, net significantly lower cm whereas arg1 and
slc6a9 higher cm compared um. plasma protein levels ip-10/cxcl10
were significantly lower cm um levels il-18 higher.
interestingly, among children cm, died complication of
malaria tended higher concentrations ip-10/cxcl10 ifn-γ those
who recovered.
conclusions: study identified new factors mechanisms play
crucial roles cm characterized respective biological pathways as
well upstream regulators.
