background: eukaryotic unicellular protist plasmodiophora brassicae an
endocellular parasite cruciferous plants. host cortical cells, protist
develops unicellular structure termed plasmodium. plasmodium is
actually multinucleated cell, subsequently splits forms resting
spores. mechanism growth endocellular parasite host cell
is unclear.
results: here, combining de novo genome sequence transcriptome analysis of
strain zj-1, identified top five significant enriched kegg pathways of
differentially expressed genes (degs), namely translation, cell growth death,
cell communication, cell motility cancers. detected 171 proto-oncogenes
from genome p. brassicae implicated cancer-related pathways, 
of 46 differential expression genes. three predicted proto-oncogenes
(pb-raf1, pb-raf2, pb-myb), showed homology human
proto-oncogenes raf myb, specifically activated plasmodial
growth host cortical cells, demonstrating involvement the
multinucleate development stage unicellular protist organism. gene
networks involved tumorigenic-related signaling transduction pathways 
the activation 12 core genes identified. inhibition of
phosphoinositol-3-kinase relieved clubroot symptom significantly
suppressed development process plasmodia.
conclusions: proto-oncogene-related regulatory mechanisms play important role 
in plasmodial growth p. brassicae.
