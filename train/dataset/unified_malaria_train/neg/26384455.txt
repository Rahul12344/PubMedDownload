the simian malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi recognized species
that cause human malaria. first report large scale human knowlesi
malaria 2004 malaysia borneo. since then, hundreds human knowlesi
malaria cases reported southeast asia. present study
investigates genetic polymorphism p. knowlesi di domain apical
membrane antigen-1 (ama-1), protein considered promising vaccine candidate
for malaria. di domain ama-1 gene p. knowlesi clinical isolates from
peninsular malaysia amplified pcr, cloned escherichia coli, then
sequenced analysed. ninety-seven di domain sequences obtained.
comparison nucleotide level p. knowlesi strain h reference
sequence showed 21 synonymous 25 nonsynonymous mutations. nonetheless,
nucleotide sequence analysis revealed low genetic diversity di domain, and
it purifying (negative) selection. amino acid level, 26
different haplotypes identified 2 predominant haplotypes (h1, h2)
with high frequencies. phylogenetic analysis revealed 26 haplotypes
could clustered 2 distinct groups (i ii). members groups 
basically derived haplotypes h1 h2, respectively.
