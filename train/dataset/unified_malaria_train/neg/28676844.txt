coenzyme (coa) essential universal cofactor prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells. nearly non-photosynthetic cells, coa biosynthesis
depends uptake phosphorylation vitamin b5 (pantothenic acid or
pantothenate). recently, putative pantothenate transporter (pat) pantothenate
kinases (panks) functionally characterized p. yoelii. pat panks 
shown dispensable blood stage development, essential 
mosquito stages development. yet, little known cellular functions of
the enzymes coa biosynthesis pathway malaria parasite life cycle 
stages. enzymes pathway targeted deletion or
deletion/complementation analyses knockout/knock-in plasmid constructs to
reveal essential roles p. yoelii life cycle stages. intermediate
enzymes ppcs (phosphopantothenylcysteine synthase), ppcdc
(phosphopantothenylcysteine decarboxylase) shown dispensable for
asexual sexual blood stage development, essential oocyst
development production sporozoites. however, last two enzymes of
this pathway, ppat (phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase) dpck
(dephospho-coa kinase), essential blood stage development. results
indicate alternative first substrate requirement malaria parasite, 
than canonical pantothenate, synthesis coa blood not
inside mosquito midgut. collectively, data shows coa de novo
biosynthesis essential blood mosquito stages, thus validates 
the enzymes pathway potential antimalarial targets.
