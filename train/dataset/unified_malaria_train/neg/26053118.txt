modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) highly attenuated strain vaccinia
virus, used recombinant vaccine vector many vaccine
development programmes. loss many immunosuppressive host-range genes
resulted safe immunogenic vaccine vector. however still retains 
immunomodulatory genes may reduce mva immunogenicity. earlier reports
demonstrated deletion a41l, b15r, c6l, c12l open reading
frames (orfs) enhanced cellular immune responses recombinant mva (rmva) 
to 2-fold. however, previously, showed deletion c12l, a44l, a46r, 
b7r, b15r orfs rmva, using mva-bac recombineering technology, not
enhance rmva immunogenicity either peak memory cellular immune responses.
here, extend previous study examine effect deleting clusters 
genes rmva cellular immunogenicity. two clusters fifteen genes deleted
in one rmva mutant encodes either 85a antigen mycobacterium
tuberculosis immunodominant h2-kd-restricted murine malaria epitope (pb9). 
the deletion mutants tested prime prime boost vaccination
regimens. responses showed improved peak memory cd8+ cell
frequencies. results suggest reported small increases mva
deletion mutants could replicated different antigens, epitopes.
therefore, gene deletion strategy may taken generic approach 
improving immunogenicity mva-based vaccines, carefully
assessed every individual recombinant antigen.
