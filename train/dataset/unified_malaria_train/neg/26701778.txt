background: highly sensitive, scalable diagnostic methods needed guide
malaria elimination interventions. traditional microscopy rapid
diagnostic tests (rdts) suitable diagnosis symptomatic malaria
infection, sensitive tests needed screen low-density,
asymptomatic infections targeted interventions aiming eliminate
the entire reservoir malaria infection humans.
methods: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt- pcr) was
developed multiplexed detection 18s ribosomal rna gene ribosomal
rna plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax. simulated field samples stored
for 14 days sample preservation buffer used assess analytical
sensitivity specificity. additionally, 1750 field samples southeastern
myanmar tested rdt ultrasensitive rt-pcr.
results: limits detection (lod) determined simulated field
conditions. 0.3 ml blood samples stored 14 days 28 °c 80%
humidity, lod less 16 parasites/ml p. falciparum 19.7
copies/µl p. vivax (using plasmid surrogate), 10,000-fold lower 
rdts. 1739 samples successfully evaluated ultrasensitive rt-pcr
and rdt, two rdt positive 24 positive p. falciparum, 108
were positive p. vivax, 127 positive either p. vivax and/or p.
falciparum using ultrasensitive rt-pcr.
conclusions: ultrasensitive rt-pcr method robust, field-tested
screening method vastly sensitive rdts. optimization
may result truly scalable tool suitable widespread surveillance of
low-level asymptomatic p. falciparum p. vivax parasitaemia.
