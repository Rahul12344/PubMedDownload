background objectives. malaria infection, caused plasmodium falciparum, is
the lethal frequently culminates severe clinical complications.
interleukin-22 (il-22) implicated several diseases including malaria.
the objective study investigate role il-22 gene
polymorphisms p. falciparum infection. material methods. ten
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), rs976748, rs1179246, rs2046068,
rs1182844, rs2227508, rs2227513, rs2227478, rs2227481, rs2227491, rs2227483, 
of il-22 gene genotyped pcr-based assays 250 p. falciparum
infection. il-22 gene promoter activity.results: found rs2227481 tt
genotype (odds ratio 0.254, confidence interval = 0.097-0.663, p. p. falciparum
infection. p. p. p. p.
conclusion: study suggests il-22 polymorphisms rs2227481 and
rs2227483 could contribute protection p. falciparum infection. il-22
gene promoter activity.
