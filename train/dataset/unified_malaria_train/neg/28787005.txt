the genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum antigens major hurdle in
developing effective malaria vaccine. protective efficacy vaccine is
dependent polymorphic alleles vaccine candidate antigens.
therefore, investigated genetic diversity potential vaccine
candidate antigens i.e. msp-1, msp-2, glurp, csp pfs25 field isolates of
p.falciparum determined natural immune response synthetic
peptide antigens. genotyping performed using sanger method size 
of alleles, multiplicity infection, heterogeneity recombination rate 
analyzed. asexual stage antigens highly polymorphic 55 50 unique
alleles msp-1 msp-2 genes, respectively. moi msp-1 msp-2 
1.67 1.28 respectively. total 59 genotype found glurp gene 8
types amino acid repeats conserved part rii repeat region. the
number nanp repeats 40 44 found among 55% samples csp gene
while pfs25 found almost conserved two amino acid substitution
site. level genetic diversity present study population very
similar asian countries. higher igg response found the
b-cell epitopes msp-1 csp antigens higher level antibodies 
csp b-cell epitope glurp antigen recorded increasing age groups.
significantly, higher positive responses observed csp antigen among
the samples â‰¥42 nanp repeats. present finding showed extensive diversity
in asexual stage antigens.
