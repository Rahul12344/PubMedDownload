in recent years, various intervention strategies reduced malaria morbidity
and mortality, improvements probably depend upon development a
broadly protective vaccine. better understand immune requirement for
protection, examined liver-stage immunity vaccination irradiated
sporozoites, effective though logistically difficult vaccine. identified 
population memory cd8+ t cells expressed gene signature of
tissue-resident memory (trm) cells remained permanently within liver,
where patrolled sinusoids. exploring requirements liver trm cell
induction, showed combining dendritic cell-targeted priming liver
inflammation antigen recognition hepatocytes, high frequencies trm
cells could induced cells essential protection against
malaria sporozoite challenge. study highlights immune potential liver 
trm cells provides approaches selective transfer, expansion, or
depletion, may harnessed control liver infections autoimmunity.
