objective: breast cancer severe risk public health adequately
convoluted pathogenesis. therefore, description key molecular markers 
pathways much importance clarifying molecular mechanism breast
cancer-associated fibroblasts initiation progression. breast
cancer-associated fibroblasts gene expression dataset downloaded gene
expression omnibus database.
methods: total nine samples, including three normal fibroblasts, three
granulin-stimulated fibroblasts three cancer-associated fibroblasts samples, 
were used identify differentially expressed genes (degs) normal
fibroblasts, granulin-stimulated fibroblasts cancer-associated fibroblasts
samples. gene ontology (go) pathway enrichment analysis performed,
and protein-protein interaction (ppi) network degs constructed by
networkanalyst software.
results: totally, 190 degs identified, including 66 up-regulated 124
down-regulated genes. go analysis results showed up-regulated degs were
significantly enriched biological processes (bp), including cell-cell
signalling negative regulation cell proliferation; molecular function
(mf), including insulin-like growth factor ii binding insulin-like growth
factor binding; cellular component (cc), including insulin-like growth factor
binding protein complex integral component plasma membrane; the
down-regulated degs significantly enriched bp, including cell adhesion
and extracellular matrix organization; mf, including n-acetylgalactosamine
4-sulfate 6-o-sulfotransferase activity calcium ion binding; cc, including
extracellular space extracellular matrix. wikipathways analysis showed the
up-regulated degs enriched myometrial relaxation contraction
pathways. wikipathways, reactome, pid_nci kegg pathway analysis showed the
down-regulated degs enriched endochondral ossification, tgf beta signalling 
pathway, integrin cell surface interactions, beta1 integrin cell surface
interactions, malaria glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin
sulfate/dermatan sulphate. top 5 up-regulated hub genes, cdkn2a, mme, pbx1,
igfbp3, tfap2c top 5 down-regulated hub genes vcam1, krt18, tgm2, acta2, 
and stambp identified ppi network, subnetworks revealed these
genes involved significant pathways, including myometrial relaxation 
contraction pathways, integrin cell surface interactions, beta1 integrin cell
surface interaction. besides, target hsa-mirs degs identified.
hsa-mir-759, hsa-mir-4446-5p, hsa-mir-219a-1-3p hsa-mir-26a-5p important
mirnas study.
conclusions: pinpoint important key genes pathways closely related with
breast cancer-associated fibroblasts initiation progression series of
bioinformatics analysis degs. screened genes pathways provided a
more detailed molecular mechanism underlying breast cancer-associated fibroblasts
occurrence progression, holding promise acting molecular markers and
probable therapeutic targets.
