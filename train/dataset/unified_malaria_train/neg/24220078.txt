background & objectives: search effective polymorphic markers in
plasmodium vivax highly demanding understand transmission a
population. due limited knowledge existing p. vivax, search for
polymorphic markers population studies ongoing. msp gene family of
plasmodia linked immune evasion. study circulating parasite 
population p. vivax merozoite surface protein 3β (pvmsp3β) polymorphic marker was
used investigate genetic diversity p. vivax natural infections.
methods: polymorphism pvmsp3β gene determined 46 p. vivax blood samples
from six different regions india polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) psti.
results: two different parasite genotypes, viz. type-a type-b detected
among 46 samples positive pcr, based size the
amplification. rflp analysis psti showed 22 allelic groups 15.2% samples
revealed mixed infections analysis.
conclusion: pvmsp3β found effective molecular marker p. vivax as
it shows high diversity india multiple genotypes easily distinguishable
without need sequencing.
