the data presented article associated quantitative proteomic 
analysis four mosquito tissues - midgut, malpighian tubules, ovaries fat
body female anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. identify proteins that
were expressed tissue-specific manner, four mosquito tissues were
labelled itraq labels analyzed using high-resolution mass
spectrometer. database searches 1,10,616 raw spectra 23 peptide
fractions resulted identification 84,733 peptide spectrum matches
corresponding 16,278 peptides 3372 proteins. these, 959 proteins were
found differentially expressed across tissues. gene ontology-based
bioinformatic analysis differentially expressed proteins also provided
in article. data article deposited the
(proteomexchange) consortium via pride repository accessed through
the accession id, pxd001128.
