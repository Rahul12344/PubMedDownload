background: malaria one major communicable diseases india and
worldwide. pvmsp3β highly polymorphic gene due large insertions and
deletions central alanine-rich region, which, turn, makes valuable
marker population genetic analysis. studies available india
about genetic diversity plasmodium vivax based pvmsp3β gene, hence,
this study designed understand molecular diversity p. vivax
malaria parasite. accumulating epidemiological data provide insights the
circulating genetic variants p. vivax india, ultimately benefits the
vaccine development.
materials methods: total 268 samples confirmed positive by
microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, quantitative buffy coat test were
collected four different regions india (puducherry, mangaluru, jodhpur,
and cuttack) present study. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based
diagnosis carried confirm p. vivax monoinfection, the
mono-infected samples subjected pvmsp3β gene amplification further
restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) determine suballeles.
results: based size amplified fragment, pvmsp3β gene was
apportioned two major types, namely type genotype (1.6-2 kb) was
predominantly present 148 isolates type b (1-1.5 kb) observed 110
isolates. percentage mixed infections pcr 3.73%. pcr
products subjected rflp categorize suballeles detected 39 
suballeles (a1-a39) type a, 23 suballeles (b1-b23) type b genotype. a
high degree diversity observed among isolates collected mangaluru
region compared isolates collected regions.
conclusion: present study showed high degree genetic diversity of
pvmsp3β gene among isolates collected various parts india. high
polymorphism pvmsp3β gene makes promising marker epidemiological 
vaccine development studies.
