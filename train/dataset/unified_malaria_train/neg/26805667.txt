introduction: although several phylogenetic studies plasmodium
knowlesi (p. knowlesi), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene analysis 
has shown geographical differentiation isolates different
countries.
methods: phylogenetic analysis locally acquired p. knowlesi infections, based 
on circumsporozoite, small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (ssu rrna),
merozoite surface protein 1 cox1 gene targets, performed. results
were compared published sequences regional isolates malaysia and
thailand.
results: phylogenetic analysis circumsporozoite, ssu rrna merozoite
surface protein 1 gene sequences regional p. knowlesi isolates showed no
obvious differentiation could attributed geographical origin.
however, cox1 gene analysis showed possible differentiate 
singapore-acquired p. knowlesi infections p. knowlesi infections from
peninsular malaysia sarawak, borneo, malaysia.
conclusion: ability differentiate locally acquired p. knowlesi
infections imported p. knowlesi infections important utility the
monitoring p. knowlesi malaria control programmes singapore.
