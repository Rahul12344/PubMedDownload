we developed flow-cytometry-based method separate collect cocultured
male female plasmodium falciparum gametocytes responsible malaria
transmission. purity collected cells estimated >97% using flow 
cytometry, sorted cells observed giemsa-stained thin-smear and
live-cell fluorescence microscopy. expression validated sex-specific
markers corroborated sorting strategy. collected male female gametocytes 
were used confirm three novel sex-specific markers quantitative real-time
pcr enriched sorted male female gametocyte populations than
existing sex-specific markers. also applied method proof-of-principle
drug screen allows identification drugs kill gametocytes a
sex-specific manner. since developed method allowed separation of
male female parasites culture, observed first time a
difference development time sexes: females developed faster than
males. hence, ability separate male female gametocytes opens door 
to new field sex-specific p. falciparum gametocyte biology our
understanding malaria transmission.importance protozoan plasmodium
falciparum causes severe form human malaria. development of
sexual forms (so-called gametocytes) crucial disease transmission.
however, knowledge forms severely hampered paucity of
sex-specific markers inability extract single sex gametocytes high 
purity. moreover, identification compounds specifically affect one
sex difficult due female bias gametocytes. developed a
system allows separation male female gametocytes the
same population. applying system, show male female parasites
mature different rates, might implications transmission. we
also identified new sex-specific genes used sex markers to
unravel sex-specific functions. system aid discovery 
much needed gametocidal compounds, also represents valuable tool for
exploring malaria transmission biology.
