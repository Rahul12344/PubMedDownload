the cell cycle plasmodium unique among major eukaryotic cell cycle models. 
cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) thought key molecular switches that
regulate cell cycle progression parasite. however, little information is
available plasmodium cdks. present study performed investigate
the effects cdk inhibitor, olomoucine, erythrocytic growth of
plasmodium falciparum. agent inhibited growth parasite the
trophozoite/schizont stage. furthermore, characterized plasmodium cdk
homolog, p. falciparum cdc2-related kinase-1 (pfcrk-1), potential
target olomoucine. synthesized functional kinase domain pfcrk-1 a
gst fusion protein using wheat germ protein expression system, examined its
phosphorylation activity. activity catalytic domain higher than
that gst-gfp control, kinase-negative mutant of
pfcrk-1. phosphatase treatment, labeling [γ-(32)p]atp was
abolished. recombinant human cyclin proteins added kinase
reactions, differences activity. report provides
important information future investigation plasmodium cdks.
