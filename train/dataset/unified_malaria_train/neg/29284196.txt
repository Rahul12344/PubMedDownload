malaria parasites readily sense adapt environmental changes, thus
making control eradication disease difficult. molecular studies
have unraveled tightly coordinated transcriptional machinery governed by
complex regulatory mechanisms including chromatin modification spatiotemporal
compartmentalization. histone modifying enzymes play key roles regulation 
of chromatin modification gene expression, associated cell
cycle progression, antigenic variation immune evasion. here, present a
comprehensive review key regulators plasmodium falciparum histone
acetylome; histone acetyltransferases (hats); histone deacetylases (hdacs).
we describe genome-wide occurrence hats hdacs p. falciparum
genome identify novel, well previously unclassified hats. re-confirm
the presence five known hdacs identify, novel putative hdac.
interestingly, identify several hats hdacs unique noncanonical
domain combinations indicating involvement associated functions.
moreover, phylogenetic analyses hats hdacs suggest many them
are close prokaryotic systems thus potential candidates drug
development. review deciphers phylogeny hats hdacs malaria 
parasite, investigates role drug-resistance generation, highlights
their potential therapeutic targets.
