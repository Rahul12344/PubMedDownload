bitter taste perception influences human nutrition health, genetic
variation underlying trait may play role disease susceptibility. to
better understand genetic architecture patterns phenotypic variability
of bitter taste perception, sequenced 996 bp region, encompassing coding
exon tas2r16, bitter taste receptor gene, 595 individuals 74 african
populations 94 non-africans 11 populations. also performed
genotype-phenotype association analyses threshold levels sensitivity to
salicin, bitter anti-inflammatory compound, 296 individuals central and
east africa. addition, characterized tas2r16 mutants vitro to
investigate effects polymorphic loci identified locus receptor 
function. here, report striking signatures positive selection, including
significant fay wu's h statistics predominantly east africa, indicating
strong local adaptation greater genetic structure among african populations
than expected neutrality. furthermore, observed "star-like" phylogeny 
for haplotypes derived allele polymorphic site 516 associated with
increased bitter taste perception consistent model selection
for "high-sensitivity" variation. contrast, haplotypes carrying the
"low-sensitivity" ancestral allele site 516 showed evidence strong
purifying selection. also demonstrated, first time, functional
effect nonsynonymous variation site 516 salicin phenotypic variance in
vivo diverse africans showed nonsynonymous substitutions
have weak effect cell surface expression vitro, suggesting one
main polymorphism tas2r16 influences salicin recognition. additionally, we
detected geographic differences levels bitter taste perception africa
not previously reported infer east african origin high salicin
sensitivity human populations.
