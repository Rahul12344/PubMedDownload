background: plasmodium parasites, causative agents malaria, express many
variant antigens cell surfaces. variant surface antigens (vsas) typically 
organized large subtelomeric gene families play critical roles in
virulence immune evasion. many important aspects vsa function and
evolution remain obscure, impeding understanding virulence mechanisms 
vaccine development. gain insights vsa function evolution, we
comparatively classified examined known vsa gene families across seven
plasmodium species.
results: identified set ultra-conserved orthologs within largest
plasmodium gene family pir, considered high-priority targets
for experimental functional characterization vaccine development.
furthermore, predict lipid-binding domain erythrocyte surface-expressed
pyst-a proteins, suggesting role second largest rodent parasite gene
family host cholesterol salvage. additionally, found pfmc-2tm
proteins carry novel putative functional domain named mc-tyr, is
conserved p. falciparum gene families rodent parasites. finally, 
present new conclusive evidence major plasmodium vsas pfemp1, sicavar,
and surfin evolutionarily linked modular structurally conserved
intracellular domain.
conclusion: comparative analysis plasmodium vsa gene families revealed
important functional evolutionary insights, serve starting
points experimental studies.
