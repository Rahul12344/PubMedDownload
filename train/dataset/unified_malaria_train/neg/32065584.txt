toxoplasma gondii, protozoan parasite, undergoes complex poorly
understood developmental process critical establishing chronic
infection intermediate hosts. here, applied single-cell rna-sequencing 
(scrna-seq) >5,400 toxoplasma tachyzoite bradyzoite stages using
three widely studied strains construct comprehensive atlas cell-cycle and
asexual development, revealing hidden states transcriptional factors
associated developmental stage. analysis sag1-related sequence (srs)
antigenic repertoire reveals highly heterogeneous, sporadic expression pattern 
unexplained measurement noise, cell cycle, asexual development.
furthermore, identified ap2ix-1 transcription factor controls the
switching ubiquitous sag1 rare surface antigens previously
observed tachyzoites. addition, comparative analysis toxoplasma and
plasmodium scrna-seq results reveals concerted expression gene sets, despite
fundamental differences cell division. lastly, built interactive
data-browser visualization atlas resource.

plain-language-summary: toxoplasma gondii single-celled parasite can
infect warm-blooded animals, reproduces sexually domestic and
wild cats. distantly related malaria agent, currently infects a
quarter world’s human population. although benign cases, the
condition still dangerous foetuses people whose immune system is
compromised. human body, toxoplasma cells infiltrate muscle nerve
cells; undergoes complex transformation helps parasites to
stop dividing quickly instead hide immune system dormant state.
it still unclear transition unfolds, particular genes
are switched given time. understand transformation,
scientists often measure genes active across group parasites.
however, approach gives ‘average’ picture allow each
parasite profiled, missing diversity may exist between
individuals. one area particular interest, example, set genes
called sag1-related sequences. code ‘molecular overcoat’ the
parasite, array proteins sit surface toxoplasma cells. 
than 120 sag1-related genes exist genome toxoplasma parasite,
creating whole wardrobe proteins potentially hide parasites from
the immune system. here, xue et al. harnessed technique called single-cell rna 
sequencing, allowed screen genes active 5,400
individual toxoplasma parasites different strains. analysis included
both rapidly dividing form parasite (present initial stage of
an infection), slowly dividing form found people carry toxoplasma 
without symptoms. resulting ‘atlas’ contains previously hidden
information genes used stage parasite development: this
included unexpected similarities toxoplasma malaria agent, as
well subtle differences two toxoplasma strains. atlas also 
sheds light individual parasites turns sag1-related sequences. it
reveals surprising diversity composition protein coats sported by
toxoplasma cells developmental stage, strategy may help to
thwart immune system. one individual parasite particular unusual
combination coat proteins found fast slow-dividing
human forms. parasite grown human cells, yet closer analysis
revealed activated several genes (including ones encoding protein
coat) normally ‘on’ parasites going sexual
reproduction domestic wild cats. new data atlas helps understand
how toxoplasma transmitted grow within humans, could aid the
development treatments. ultimately, better knowledge parasites
could also bring new information agent causes malaria.
