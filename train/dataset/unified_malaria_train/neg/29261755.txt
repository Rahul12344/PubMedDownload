the role nutrient-derived metabolites innate adaptive immune
responses established. global research approach investigating the
interplay environment, lifestyle host's immune responses is
crucial understanding malaria susceptibility. advanced glycation end
products (age), food-derived metabolites result link between
reducing sugar amino group proteins, lipids nucleic acids. level of
exposure ages varies depending type diet. dysfunction the
immune system induced age cellular receptors ages (rage) in
susceptibility bacterial infection described. study yet
explored role susceptibility malaria. therefore, aimed evaluate
systemic age rage gene polymorphism two sympatric populations with
previously described difference susceptibility malaria. measured by
elisa plasma levels ages, soluble receptors (srage) 170
volunteers (68 fulani 102 dogon). also determined real-time
quantitative pcr expression rage, -374 t/a, -429 t/c polymorphisms
and 63 bp deletion fragment length restriction polymorphism. prevalence

observed fulani (563,07pg/ml, 95% ci [547.81-580.13] vs 465.68pg/ml, 95% ci
