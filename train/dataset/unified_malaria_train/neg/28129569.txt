in past decade significant reduction deaths due to
malaria, part due success gold standard antimalarial treatment -
artemisinin combination therapies (acts). however potential threat act
failure lack broadly effective malaria vaccine driving efforts
to discover new chemical entities (nces) target disease. primary
sulfonamide (ps) moiety component several clinical drugs, including those
for treatment kidney disease, glaucoma epilepsy, however chemotype
has yet exploited malaria. study 31 ps compounds sourced
from glaxosmithkline (gsk) tres cantos antimalarial set (tcams) were
investigated ability selectively inhibit in vitro growth of
plasmodium falciparum asexual stage malaria parasites. these, 14 compounds
were found submicromolar activity (ic50 0.16-0.89 μm) modest
selectivity index (si) parasite versus human cells (si > 12 >43). as
the ps moiety known inhibit carbonic anhydrase (ca) enzymes many
organisms, ps compounds assessed recombinant p. falciparum ca (pfca)
mediated inhibition co2 hydration. pfca inhibition activity not
correlate antiplasmodial potency. furthermore, significant difference 
ic50 observed p. falciparum versus p. knowlesi (p > 0.05), plasmodium
species known contain annotated pfca gene. together data 
suggest asexual intraerythrocytic stage antiplasmodial activity the
ps compounds examined study likely unrelated pfca inhibition.
