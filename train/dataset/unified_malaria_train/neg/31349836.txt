background: insecticide resistance anopheles stephensi, main malaria
vector eastern afghanistan, reported previously. study describes
the biochemical molecular mechanisms resistance facilitate effective
vector control insecticide resistance management.
methods: mosquito larvae collected provinces kunar, laghman 
nangarhar 2014 2017. susceptibility reared 3-4Â days old adults
was tested deltamethrin 0.05%, bendiocarb 0.1%, malathion 5%, permethrin
0.75% ddt 4%. cytochrome p450 content general esterase, glutathione
s-transferase (gst) acetylcholinesterase (ache) activities measured in
the three field populations results compared the
laboratory susceptible an. stephensi beech strain. two separate allele-specific
pcr assays used identify l1014, l1014f l1014s mutations the
voltage gated sodium channel gene an. stephensi. probit analysis, anova and
hardy-weinberg equilibrium used analyse bioassay, biochemical assay and
gene frequency data respectively.
results: population an. stephensi kunar susceptible to
bendiocarb, apart this, populations resistant other
insecticides tested. differences values cytochrome p450s,
general esterases, gsts ache inhibition rates kunar, laghman and
nangarhar populations statistically significant compared beech
strain, excluding gst activities kunar beech due high standard
deviation kunar. three different sodium channel alleles [l1014 (wild
type), l1014f (kdr west) l1014s (kdr east)] segregated afghan
populations. frequencies kdr east mutation 22.9%, 32.7% 35% in
kunar, laghman nangarhar populations respectively. kdr west lowest
frequency 4.44%.
conclusions: resistance different groups insecticides field
populations an. stephensi kunar, laghman nangarhar provinces of
afghanistan caused range metabolic site insensitivity mechanisms, 
including esterases, cytochrome p450s gsts combined ache sodium
channel target site insensitivity. intensity frequency these
mechanisms increasing populations, calling urgent reorientation 
of vector control programmes implementation insecticide resistance
management strategies.
