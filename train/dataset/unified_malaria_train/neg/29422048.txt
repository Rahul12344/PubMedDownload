to limit spread impact anti-malarial drug resistance react
accordingly, surveillance systems able detect track real-time its
emergence spread need strengthened places established.
currently, surveillance anti-malarial drug resistance done three 
approaches: (1) vivo studies assess efficacy drugs patients; (2) 
in vitro/ex vivo studies evaluate parasite susceptibility drugs; and/or
(3) molecular assays detect validated gene mutations and/or gene copy number
changes associated drug resistance. methods are
complementary, evaluate different aspects resistance; however,
standardization methods, especially vitro/ex vivo molecular
techniques, lacking. world health organization developed standard
protocol evaluating efficacy anti-malarial drugs, used by
national malaria control programmes conduct therapeutic efficacy
studies. regional networks, east african network monitoring
antimalarial treatment amazon network surveillance of
antimalarial drug resistance, set strengthen regional capacities 
for monitoring anti-malarial drug resistance. worldwide antimalarial
resistance network established collate provide global spatial and
temporal trends information efficacy anti-malarial drugs and
resistance. exchange information across endemic countries essential
for monitoring anti-malarial resistance, sustainable funding surveillance
and networking activities remains challenging. technology landscape for
molecular assays progressing quite rapidly, easy-to-use affordable new
techniques becoming available. also offer advantage high
throughput analysis simple blood spots obtained finger prick. new
technologies combined strengthening national reference laboratories
in malaria-endemic countries standardized protocols training plus the
availability proficiency testing programme, would contribute the
improvement sustainability anti-malarial resistance surveillance networks 
worldwide.
