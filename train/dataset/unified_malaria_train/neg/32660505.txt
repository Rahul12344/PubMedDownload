background: eighteen imported ovale malaria cases imported myanmar and
various african countries reported yunnan province, china 2013 
to 2018. confirmed morphological examination 18s
small subunit ribosomal rna gene (18s rrna) based pcr ynrl. nevertheless, 
subtypes plasmodium ovale could identified based 18s rrna gene test,
thus posing challenges accurate diagnosis. help establish more
sensitive specific method detection p. ovale genes, study
performs sequence analysis k13-propeller polymorphisms p. ovale.
methods: dried blood spots (dbs) ovale malaria cases collected from
january 2013 december 2018, infection sources confirmed according
to epidemiological investigation. dna extracted, coding region (from 
206th aa 725th aa) k13 gene propeller domain amplified using nested
pcr. subsequently, amplified products sequenced compared with
reference sequence obtain cds. haplotypes mutation loci cds
were analysed, spatial structure amino acid peptide chain k13
gene propeller domain predicted swiss-model.
results: coding region 224th aa 725th aa k13 gene p. ovale in
83.3% collected samples (15/18) amplified. three haplotypes observed
in 15 samples, values ka/ks, nucleic acid diversity index (π) and
expected heterozygosity (he) 3.784, 0.0095, 0.4250. curtisi haplotype,
wallikeri haplotype, mutant type accounted 73.3% (11/15), 20.0% (3/15),
and 6.7% (1/15). predominant haplotypes p. ovale curtisi determined
in five myanmar isolates. ten african isolates, six identified as
p. o. curtisi, three p. o. wallikeri one mutant type. base
substitutions sequences p. o. curtisi p. o. wallikeri were
determined 38 loci, c.711. moreover, a > t base substitution at
c.1428 nonsynonymous mutation, resulting amino acid variation t476s
in 476th position. compared sequence p. o. wallikeri, double
nonsynonymous mutations g > a a > t sites c.1186 c.1428
leads variations d396n t476s 396th 476th amino acids
positions. p. o. curtisi p. o. wallikeri, peptide chains the
coding region 224th aa 725th aa k13 gene merely formed monomeric
spatial model, whereas double-variant peptide chains d396n t476s
formed homodimeric spatial model.
conclusion: propeller domain k13 gene p. ovale isolates imported
into yunnan province myanmar africa showed high differentiation. the
sequences myanmar-imported isolates belong p. o. curtisi, the
sequences african isolates showed sympatric distribution p. o.
curtisi, p. o. wallikeri mutant isolates. cds double base
substitution formed dimeric spatial model encode peptide chain, is
completely different monomeric spatial structure encode peptide
chain p. o. curtisi p. o. wallikeri.
