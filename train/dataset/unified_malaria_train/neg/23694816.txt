background: treatment vivax malaria primaquine prevents risk of
relapse. study designed assess efficacy 8 weeks primaquine 
treatment prevention relapse patients vivax malaria south and
south-east iran sscp-pcr sequencing.
methods: total 163 symptomatic vivax malaria cases followed in
hormozgan sistan, baluchestan provinces south south-east iran 
december 2008 december 2011. dna extracted primary secondary
positive samples. variation region pvmsp-1 gene selected amplified
by pcr. obtained fragments processed polyacrylamide gel for
single-strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) sequenced.
results: among 145 patients treated chloroquine plus primaquine who
completed study period, two patients (1.4%) experienced secondary infection
after initial episode plasmodium vivax. comparison primary and
secondary isolates sscp indicated different banding patterns and
electrophoretic mobility. alignment nucleotide sequences pair primary 
and secondary isolates revealed dissimilar homology. secondary isolates both
patients considered reinfection. five 18 cases (28%) treated 
chloroquine revealed secondary infection. analysis nucleotide sequences
and sscp patterns indicated relapse them.
conclusion: survey indicates intake primaquine, 0.75 mg/kg, weekly
for 8 consecutive weeks, effective prevention relapse vivax
cases iran.
