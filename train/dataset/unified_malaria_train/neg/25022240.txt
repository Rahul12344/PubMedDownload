the eukaryotic unicellular pathogen plasmodium falciparum tightly regulates gene 
expression, development adaptation dynamic host
environments. regulation evident mutually exclusive expression 
members clonally variant virulence multigene families. epigenetic
regulators selectively identified active repressed virulence
genes, specific recruitment remains mystery. recent years, noncoding
rnas (ncrnas) emerged lynchpins eukaryotic gene regulation; binding
to epigenetic regulators, provide target specificity otherwise
non-specific enzyme complexes. surprisingly, great interest in
understanding role ncrna p. falciparum, particular, their
contribution mutually exclusive expression virulence genes. current
repertoire p. falciparum ncrnas includes, limited to, subtelomeric 
ncrnas, virulence gene-associated ncrnas natural antisense rna transcripts.
continued improvement high-throughput sequencing methods sure expand
this repertoire. here, summarize recent advances p. falciparum ncrna
biology, emphasis ncrna-mediated epigenetic modes gene regulation.
