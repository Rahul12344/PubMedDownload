background: indoor residual spraying (irs) long-lasting insecticidal nets
(llins) first-line tools malaria prevention control africa.
vector resistance insecticides extensively studied, however the
insecticidal effects nets sprayed walls pyrethroid resistant
mosquitoes studied thoroughly. evaluated bioefficacy llins
of different ages lambda-cyhalothrin (icon 10cs) sprayed mud walls for
a period time malaria vector survivorship.
methods: tube bioassay performed using diagnostic doses of
lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) deltamethrin (0.05%). cone
bioassays conducted netting materials 0 3 years old long-lasting 
insecticide-impregnated nets. wall bioassays performed monthly mud slabs 
sprayed lambdacyhalothrin period seven months. bioassays used 
an. gambiae mosquitoes collected field laboratory susceptible
reference kisumu strain. concentration insecticides netting
materials examined using gas chromatography method. mosquitoes were
identified species level using pcr genotyped kdr gene mutation
frequencies.
results: bioassays results showed populations five sites were
highly resistant pyrethroids (mortalities ranged 52.5 75.3%), 
two sites moderately resistant insecticides (80.4 - 87.2%).
homozygote kdr mutations l1014s ranged 73 88% an. gambiae s.s.
dominant populations whereas l1014s mutation frequencies relatively low
(7-31%) an. arabiensis dominant populations. significant decrease 
(p < 0.05) mosquito mortality time spray both
lambda-cyhalothrin (75% mortality six months) age llins
(60% mortality 24 month). field collected mosquitoes able survive
exposure irs llins even newly sprayed walls (86.6-93.5%
mortality) new llins (77.5-85.0% mortality), wild mosquitoes collected from
the field significantly lower mortality rates llins (59.6-85.0%) than
laboratory reared susceptible strain (100%). insecticide concentration decreased 
significantly 0.14 μg/ml new nets 0.077 μg/ml nets older than
18 months (p < 0.05).
conclusion: study confirms insecticide decay developing levels of
resistance negative contribution reduced efficacy itn irs in
western kenya. factors contribute decreased efficacy pyrethroid
insectides ongoing malaria control programs. order mitigate 
impact insecticide resistance decay important follow who
policy provide residents new llins every three years use while
maintaining high level llins coverage usage. also need for
urgent development deployment non-pyrethroid based vector control tools.
