the apicomplexa parasite plasmodium major cause death developing
countries less equipped bring new medicines market. currently
available drugs used treatment malaria limited either inadequate
efficacy, toxicity and/or increased resistance. availability genome
sequence, microarray data metabolic profile plasmodium parasite offers 
opportunity identification stage-specific genes important the
organism's lifecycle. study, microarray data analysed for
differential expression overlapped onto metabolic pathways identify
differentially regulated pathways essential transition successive
erythrocytic stages. results obtained indicate s-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase/ornithine decarboxylase, bifunctional enzyme required for
polyamine synthesis, important plasmodium cell growth absence
of exogenous polyamines. s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase/ornithine
decarboxylase valuable target designing therapeutically useful
inhibitors. one inhibitor, [formula: see text]-difluoromethyl ornithine, 
currently use treatment african sleeping sickness caused by
trypanosoma brucei. structural studies ornithine decarboxylase along with
known inhibitors analogues carried screen drug databases
for effective less toxic compounds.
