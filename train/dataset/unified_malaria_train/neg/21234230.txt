the onset, severity, ultimate outcome malaria infection influenced 
parasite-expressed virulence factors individual host responses these
determinants. humans mice, liver injury involved parasite
entry, persists erythrocyte stage infection fatal 
strain plasmodium falciparum (pf). hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) strong
anti-apoptotic effects various kinds cells, also diverse metabolic 
functions. work, pf-subtilisin-like protease 2 (pf-sub2) 5'untranslated
region (utr) analyzed transcriptional activity estimated by
luciferase expression. fourteen tata boxes observed one oct-1 and
c-myb done. addition, host hgf interaction pf-sub2 evaluated 
co-transfection hgf- pf-sub2-cloned vector. interestingly, -1,422/+12 utr 
exhibited strongest luciferase activity -329 +12 utr exhibit
luciferase activity. moreover, compared control unexpressed hgf,
the hgf protein suppressed luciferase expression driven 5'untranslated
region pf-sub2 promoter. taken together, suggested hgf controls
and interacts promoter region pf-sub2 gene.
