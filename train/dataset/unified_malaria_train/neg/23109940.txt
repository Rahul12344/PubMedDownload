background: plasmodium vivax predominant species causes malaria with
about 90% total annual reported malaria iran. study conducted to
determine susceptibility plasmodium vivax isolates chloroquine in
sistan balochistan province, southeastern iran.
methods: total 270 subjects symptomatic malaria confirmed p. vivax
infection completed designed 28-day vivo study. thick thin film
blood smears screened malaria parasites microscopy. nested pcr
was applied using plasmodium 18 subunit ribosomal ribonucleic (ssr rna) genes
for detecting mixed infections diagnosis parasites samples low
parasite days 0, 5, 6, 7, 28.
results: p. vivax cleared 15%, 50%, 95%, 100% patients days 1,
2, 3, 4 respectively microscopy assessment. six patients exhibited
specific p. vivax band nested pcr day 5. recurrence observed days
7, 14 28. mean (±standard deviation) parasite clearance time 2.41 (±0.8) 
days.
conclusion: p. vivax still susceptible chloroquine southeatern iran.
this finding compatible results neighboring countries pakistan and
afghanistan.
