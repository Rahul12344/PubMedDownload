the apicomplexan parasite plasmodium vivax responsible causing than
70% human malaria cases central south america, southeastern asia and
the indian subcontinent. rising severity disease increasing
incidences resistance shown parasite towards usual therapeutic
regimens necessitated investigation putative novel drug targets combat
this disease. apicoplast, organelle procaryotic origin, its
circular genome carrying genes possible functional importance, being
looked upon potential drug targets. genes circular genome are
believed highly conserved among plasmodium species. till date, the
plastid genome p. falciparum, p. berghei p. chabaudi detailed
while partial sequences genes parasites including p. vivax
have studied identifying evolutionary positions parasites. 
functional aspects significance genes still
hypothetical. one previous reports, detailed complete
sequence, well structural functional characteristics elongation 
factor encoding tufa gene plastid genome p. vivax. present here
the sequences large small subunit rrna (lsu ssu rrna) genes, sufb
(orf470) gene, rna polymerase (rpo b, c) subunit genes clpc (casienolytic
protease) gene plastid genome p. vivax. comparative analysis of
these genes p. vivax p. falciparum reveals approximately 5-16%
differences. codon usage analysis major plastid genes shown high
frequency codons rich a/t three positions the
species. tta, aat, aaa, tat, ata major preferred codons. the
sequences, functional domains structural analysis respective proteins do
not show variations active sites. comparative analysis these
indian p. vivax plastid genome encoded genes also done understand the
evolutionary position indian parasite comparison plasmodium
species.
