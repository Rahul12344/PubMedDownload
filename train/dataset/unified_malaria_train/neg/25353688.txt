population genetic structures two major malaria vectors anopheles gambiae 
s.s. an. arabiensis, differ markedly across sub-saharan africa, could
reflect differences historical demographies contemporary gene flow.
elucidation degree cause population structure important for
predicting spread genetic traits insecticide resistance genes or
artificially engineered genes. population genetics an. gambiae s.s.
and an. arabiensis central, eastern island regions tanzania were
compared. microsatellite markers screened 33 collections female an.
gambiae s.l., originating 22 geographical locations, four were
sampled two three years 2008 2010. an. gambiae sampled
from six sites, an. arabiensis 14 sites, species two sites,
with additional colonised insectary sample species. frequencies the
knock-down resistance (kdr) alleles 1014s 1014f also determined. an.
gambiae exhibited relatively high genetic differentiation (average pairwise
fst = 0.131), significant even nearby samples, without clear
geographical patterning. contrast, an. arabiensis exhibited limited
differentiation (average fst = 0.015), strong isolation-by-distance (mantel
test r = 0.46, p = 0.0008). time-series samples an. arabiensis were
homogeneous, suggesting general temporal stability genetic structure. an. 
gambiae populations dar es salaam bagamoyo found high
frequencies kdr 1014s (around 70%), almost 50% homozygote much
lower frequency unguja island, no. an. gambiae population genetic
differentiation consistent island model genetic structuring with
highly restricted gene flow, contrary an. arabiensis consistent with
a stepping-stone model extensive, geographically-restricted gene flow.
