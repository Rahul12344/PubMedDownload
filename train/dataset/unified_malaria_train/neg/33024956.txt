objective: pursue systematic review summarise current evidence for
the potential transcriptome molecular profiling investigating preterm
phenotype.
study design: systematically reviewed literature, using readily available 
electronic databases (i.e. pubmed/medline, embase, scopus web science)
from inception march 2020 identify investigations maternal
blood-derived rna profiling preterm birth (ptb). studies included if
circulating coding non-coding rna analysed maternal blood during
pregnancy and/or delivery. interventional trials included. the
primary outcome availability whole genome expression patterns
evaluated pregnancies resulting preterm deliveries.
results: total 35 articles included final analysis. 
studies conducted high-income countries published last decade.
apart spontaneous ptb, variety phenotypes leading preterm delivery
were reported. differences sampling methods, target gene selection and
laboratory protocols severely limited quantitative comparisons. the
studies revealed gene expression profiling pregnancy high
potential identifying women risk spontaneous and/or non-spontaneous ptb
as early first trimester.
conclusion: assessing maternal blood-derived transcriptional signatures ptb
risk pregnant women holds promise screening approach. however,
longitudinally followed, prospective pregnancy cohorts lacking. are
relevant identifying causes leading ptb whether prediction of
spontaneous ptb co-morbidities associated ptb achievable. more
emphasis widely employed standardised protocols required ensure
comparability results.
