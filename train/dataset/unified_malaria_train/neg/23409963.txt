background: investigations evaluating burden malaria
disease district level republic congo since introduction of
artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts). main objective study 
was document laboratory-confirmed cases malaria using microscopy and/or
rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) children pregnant women attending selected
health facilities brazzaville pointe noire, two main cities the
country. secondly, p. falciparum genetic diversity multiplicity infection 
during malaria transmission season october 2011 february 2012 
areas described.
methods: three one health facilities selected brazzaville and
pointe-noire sentinel sites malaria surveillance. children 15 years 
of age pregnant women enrolled study criteria met lab
technicians used rdt and/or microscopy diagnose malaria. order determine
the multiplicity infection, parasite dna extracted rdt cassette and
msp2 p.falciparum genotyped.
results: malaria prevalence among 3,000 children 700 pregnant women
ranged 8 29%, 8 24% respectively depending health center
locality. health workers optimize use rdts, microscopy remained 
a reference diagnostic tool. quality control malaria diagnosis the
reference laboratory showed acceptable health centre performances. p. falciparum 
genetic diversity determination using msp2 gene marker ranged 9 20
alleles remains stable multiplicity infection (mean of
1.7clone/infected individual) parasite densities clinical isolates were
lower previously reported.
conclusions: findings consistent reduction malaria
transmission two areas. study raises issue targeted training
for health workers sustained availability rdts order improve quality
of care optimal use rdts.
