background: artemisinin-induced dormancy provides plausible explanation for
recrudescence following artemisinin monotherapy. phenomenon shares
similarities cell cycle arrest cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and
cyclins play important role.
methods: transcription profiles plasmodium falciparum cdks cyclins 
and dihydroartemisinin (dha) treatment three parasite lines, the
effect cdk inhibitors parasite recovery dha-induced dormancy were
investigated.
results: dha treatment, parasites enter dormancy phase followed a
recovery phase. dormancy phase parasites up-regulate pfcrk1, pfcrk4,
pfcyc2 pfcyc4, down-regulate pfmrk, pfpk5, pfpk6, pfcrk3, pfcyc1 and
pfcyc3. entering recovery phase parasites immediately up-regulate all
cdk cyclin genes. three cdk inhibitors, olomoucine, wr636638 roscovitine,
produced distinct effects different phases dha-induced dormancy, blocking
parasites recovery.
conclusions: up-regulation pfcrk1 pfcrk4, regulation other
cdks cyclins correlate parasite survival dormant state. changes
in cdk expression likely negatively regulate parasite progression g1 
to phase. findings provide new insights mechanism of
artemisinin-induced dormancy cell cycle regulation p. falciparum, opening 
new opportunities preventing recrudescence following artemisinin treatment.
