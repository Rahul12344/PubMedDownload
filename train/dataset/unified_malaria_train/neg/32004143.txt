background marked differences among genotype frequencies (caucasians, asians, and
africans) observed cytochrome p450 (cyp) genes. data the
frequency pharmacogenetic relevant polymorphisms bhutanese population is
absent. study aimed investigate frequencies pharmacogenetic
relevant polymorphisms cyp2c9 (*2 *3), cyp2c19 (*2 *3), cyp2d6 (*10), 
and cyp3a5 (*3) bhutanese population. methods genotyping performed 443 
dna samples using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism. results cyp2c9, allele frequencies *2 *3 variants were
0.339% 0%, respectively. cyp2c19, frequencies *2 *3 variants 
30.135% 15.689%, respectively. allele frequencies cyp2d6*10 cyp3a5*3
were 21.332% 77.314%, respectively. allele frequencies cyp2c9*2 are
similar asians cyp2c9*3 absent. cyp2c19*2 showed close
resemblance japanese burmese, cyp2c19*3 near japanese and
korean. cyp2d6*10 noticeably lower asians. cyp3a5*3 similar to
east asians (chinese, japanese, korean). conclusions bhutanese population
is polymorphic cyp genes, except cyp2c9*3. similar other
populations, genetic testing genes may, therefore, helpful obtain
the benefit pharmacological treatments prevent adverse drug reactions.
