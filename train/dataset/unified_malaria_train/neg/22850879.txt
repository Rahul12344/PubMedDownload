plasmodium falciparum major cause malaria globally transmitted
by mosquitoes. parasitic development, p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes 
(p. falciparum-ies) express multiple polymorphic proteins known variant
surface antigens (vsas), including p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein
1 (pfemp1). vsa-specific antibodies associated protection from
symptomatic severe malaria. however, importance different vsa
targets immunity malaria remains unclear, impeded an
understanding malaria immunity vaccine development. study, we
developed assays using transgenic p. falciparum modified pfemp1 expression
to quantify serum antibodies vsas among individuals exposed malaria. we
found majority human antibody response ie targets pfemp1. 
furthermore, longitudinal studies showed individuals with
pfemp1-specific antibodies significantly reduced risk developing
symptomatic malaria, whereas antibodies surface antigens not
associated protective immunity. using assays measure antibody-mediated 
phagocytosis ies, important mechanism parasite clearance, identified 
pfemp1 major target functional antibodies. taken together, 
data demonstrate pfemp1 key target humoral immunity. findings 
advance understanding targets mediators human immunity to
malaria major implications malaria vaccine development.
