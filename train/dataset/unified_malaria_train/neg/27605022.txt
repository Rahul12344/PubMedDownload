malaria continues impose significant disease burden low- and
middle-income countries tropics. however, revolutionary progress 
last 3Â years nucleic acid sequencing, reverse genetics, post-genome
analyses generated step changes understanding malaria parasite
(plasmodium spp.) biology interactions host vector. driven
by availability vast amounts genome sequence data plasmodium
species strains, relevant human populations different ethnicities, and
mosquito vectors, researchers consider biological component the
malarial process isolation interactive setting infection. in
particular, considerable progress made area population
genomics, plasmodium falciparum serving highly relevant model. such
studies demonstrated genome evolution strong selective pressure
can detected. data, combined reverse genetics, enabled the
identification region p. falciparum genome selective 
pressure confirmation functionality mutations the
kelch13 gene accompany resistance major frontline antimalarial,
artemisinin. furthermore, central role epigenetic regulation gene
expression antigenic variation developmental fate p. falciparum is
becoming ever clearer. review summarizes recent exciting discoveries that
genome technologies enabled malaria research highlights their
applications healthcare. knowledge gained help develop
surveillance approaches emergence spread drug resistance to
identify new targets development antimalarial drugs perhaps
vaccines.
