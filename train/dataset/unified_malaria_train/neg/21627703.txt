the study host-parasite relationships involving vector-borne parasites
requires understanding interactions parasites vectors. capacity
of haemosporidians infect insects clear evolutionary consequences 
transmission diseases. here, investigated (i) associations between
blood parasites, biting midges birds (ii) potential specificity
between biting midge haemosporidian haplotypes. total 629 parous biting 
midges culicoides 224 wild birds (belonging seven species) locality
of central spain individually examined presence haemoproteus 
plasmodium parasites sequencing fragment cytochrome b. biting midges were
identified morphologically characterized basis fragment the
cytochrome c oxidase (coi) gene. overall, 12 haemoproteus three plasmodium
haplotypes isolated sequenced. among them, 10 haplotypes were
exclusively isolated biting midges, three haplotypes birds two
haplotypes biting midges birds. biting midge haplotypes showed both
specific generalist relationships haemoproteus haplotypes only
generalist relationships plasmodium haplotypes. several c. festivipennis and
c. kibunesis haplotypes established significant coevolutionary links with
haemoproteus haplotypes. results shed light specificity of
interactions vectors blood parasites.
