nested pcr method used amplify plasmodium vivax merozoite surface
protein 1 (pvmsp-1) gene fragment containing icb5 icb6 region from
plasmodium vivax liaoning province. pcr products digested pvu ii
restriction endonuclease digested fragments observed 1.5% agarose
gel electrophoresis, followed sequencing analysis comparison. in
11 field isolates p. vivax, two kinds dna fragments 470 400 bp
were produced respectively. pvuii digestion, two sal-1 type fragments (120 
and 350 bp) obtained 5 samples 470 bp. single band 400 bp
appeared 1 samples belem type. two bands 120 280 bp appeared from
another 1 sample recombination type iii, 4 bands 120 240 bp
as korean isolate. principal types pvmsp-1 alleles exist malaria
endemic areas liaoning province mixed infection two different type 
alleles.
