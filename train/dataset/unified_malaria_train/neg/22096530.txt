the use genetically modified mice, i.e. transgenic well gene knockout
(ko) knock-in mice, become established tool study gene function 
many animal models human diseases. however, gene functions particular 
genomic context. implies importance well-defined homogenous genetic
background analysis interpretation phenotypes associated with
genetic mutations. studying plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (pcas) malaria
infection mice bearing tlr9 null mutation, found increased
susceptibility infection, i.e. higher parasitemia levels increased
mortality. however, triggered deficient tlr9 gene itself.
instead, disease phenotype dependent heterogeneous genetic
background mice, appeared insufficiently defined determined by
single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) analysis. hence, critical
importance study gene ko phenotypes homogenous genetic background
identical wild type (wt) control counterparts. particular, to
avoid problems related insufficiently defined genetic background, we
advocate study involving genetically modified mice, least a
detailed description origin genetic background wt control 
and altered strain mice essential.
