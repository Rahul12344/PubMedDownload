antibodies blood-stage antigens plasmodium falciparum play pivotal role
in human immunity malaria. parasite development, multiple proteins 
trafficked intracellular parasite surface p.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies). however, relative importance of
different proteins targets acquired antibodies, key pathways involved
in trafficking major antigens remain clearly defined. quantified
antibodies surface antigens among children, adults, pregnant women from
different malaria-exposed regions. quantified importance antigens as
antibody targets using genetically engineered p. falciparum modified surface
antigen expression. genetic deletion trafficking protein skeleton-binding 
protein-1 (sbp1), involved trafficking surface antigen pfemp1,
led dramatic reduction antibody recognition ies ability of
human antibodies promote opsonic phagocytosis ies, key mechanism of
parasite clearance. great majority antibody epitopes ie surface
were sbp1-dependent. demonstrated using parasite isolates different
genetic phenotypic backgrounds, among antibodies children, adults,
and pregnant women different populations. comparisons antibody reactivity
to parasite isolates sbp1 deletion inhibited pfemp1 expression suggest
that pfemp1 dominant target acquired human antibodies, other
p. falciparum ie surface proteins minor targets. results establish sbp1
as part critical pathway trafficking major surface antigens
targeted human immunity, key implications vaccine development,
and quantifying immunity populations.
