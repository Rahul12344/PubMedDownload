background: malaria deadly vector-borne disease tropical subtropical 
regions. although indigenous malaria eliminated guangxi china, 473
confirmed cases reported northern region neighbouring vietnam in
2014. considering frequent population movement occurs across the
china-vietnam border insecticide resistance major obstacle disease
vector control, need know genotype frequency insecticide
resistance alleles anopheles sinensis populations along china-vietnam
border take action prevent possible migration insecticide
resistance alleles across border.
methods: two hundred eight adults an. sinensis collected seven
locations guangxi along china-vietnam border used the
investigation individual genotypes asrdl gene, encodes rdl
gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) receptor subunit an. sinensis. pcr-rflp
(polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis was
deployed genotype codon 345, direct sequencing pcr products was
conducted clarify genotypes codons 296 327 asrdl gene. 
genealogical relation asrdl haplotypes analyzed using network 5.0.
results: three putative insecticide resistance related mutations (a296s, v327i
and t345s) detected seven populations an. sinensis guangxi 
along china-vietnam border. resistance-conferring a296s mutation was
found widely distributed present notably high frequencies (78.8% 
100%). relatively lower frequencies mutations v327i (26.9% 53.2%) t345s
(0% 28.8%) observed. v327i t345s always occurred presence
of a296s. evolutionary analysis 21 asrdl haplotypes indicated multiple origins
of a296s v327i mutations.
conclusion: resistance a296s allele present high frequencies the
an. sinensis populations along china-vietnam border, indicating risk of
resistance insecticides targeting rdl. double mutations (a296s + v327i)
may evolved alleles carrying a296s mutation scaffolding the
additional mutation v327i, a296s allele may multiple evolutionary
origins. findings help inform strategies vector control and
malaria prevention.
