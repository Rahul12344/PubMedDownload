protozoan parasites rely purine nucleosides supplied host 
are unable synthesise purine rings denovo. nucleoside transporter 1 (nt1) 
purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp) play essential role purine salvage in
plasmodium. unclear whether severe pathology, cerebral malaria
(cm), develops hosts infected plasmodium parasites lack activity 
nt1 pnp. plasmodium berghei (pb) anka-infected mice show features similar to
human cm, cerebral paralysis cerebral haemorrhage. therefore, pb anka
infection mice good experimental model cm. study, generated
pbnt1-disrupted pb anka (δpbnt1 parasites) pbpnp-disrupted pb anka (δpbpnp
parasites), investigated effect pbnt1 pbpnp disruption the
outcome infection pb anka. showed rapid increase wild-type
pb anka (wt parasites) mice early infection significantly inhibited 
disruption pbnt1. moreover, δpbnt1 parasite-infected mice showed neither
cerebral paralysis cerebral haemorrhage, mice spontaneously recovered
from infection. contrast, mice infected δpbpnp parasites showed features 
similar mice infected wt parasites. study, we
demonstrated high virulence pb anka asexual phase is
suppressed disruption pbnt1 pbpnp.
