background: members plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(pfemp1) adhesion antigen family major contributors pathogenesis p.
falciparum malaria infections. pfemp1-encoding var genes among most
diverse sequences nature, three genes, var1, var2csa var3 found
conserved parasite genomes. severe forms malaria disease 
caused parasites expressing subset antigenically conserved pfemp1
variants. thus ubiquitous conserved var3 pfemp1 particular interest
to research field. evidence var3 expression infected erythrocyte
surface never presented, var3 genes proposed be
transcribed expressed differently rest var gene family
members.
methods: study, parasites expressing var3 pfemp1 generated using
anti-var3 antibodies var transcript pfemp1 expression profiles the
generated parasites investigated. igg reactivity plasma children
living malaria-endemic tanzania tested parasites recombinant var3
protein. parasites hospitalized children isolated transcript
level var3 investigated.
results: var3 transcribed protein product expressed surface 
infected erythrocytes. var3-expressing parasites better recognized by
childrenÂ´s igg parasite line expressing group b var gene. two 130
children showed increased recognition parasites expressing var3 the
recombinant var3 protein malaria episode isolated parasites
showed high levels var3 transcripts.
conclusions: collectively, presented data suggest var3 transcribed
and protein product expressed surface infected erythrocytes 
same manner seen var genes vitro vivo. 
children exhibit seroconversion var3 following malaria episode requiring
hospitalization, supporting previous conclusion drawn var3 transcript
analysis parasites collected children hospitalized malaria, that
var3 associated severe anaemia cerebral malaria syndromes in
children.
