therapies prevent transmission malaria parasites mosquito vector are
a vital part global malaria elimination agenda. primaquine currently
the drug activity; however, use limited side effects.
the development transmission-blocking strategies requires understanding 
sexual stage malaria parasite (gametocyte) biology identification new 
drug leads. lysine acetylation important posttranslational modification
involved regulating eukaryotic gene expression essential processes. 
interfering process histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors a
validated strategy cancer diseases, including asexual stage malaria
parasites. confirm expression least one hdac protein in
plasmodium falciparum gametocytes show histone nonhistone protein
acetylation occurs life cycle stage. activity canonical hdac
inhibitors trichostatin (tsa) suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha;
vorinostat) panel novel hdac inhibitors early/late-stage gametocytes 
and gamete formation examined. several compounds displayed
early/late-stage gametocytocidal activity, tsa potent (50%
inhibitory concentration, 70 90 nm). contrast, inhibitory activity was
observed p. falciparum gametocyte exflagellation experiments. gametocytocidal 
hdac inhibitors caused hyperacetylation gametocyte histones, consistent a
mode action targeting hdac activity. data identify hdac inhibitors as
being among limited number compounds target asexual sexual
stage malaria parasites, making potential new starting point for
gametocytocidal drug leads valuable tools dissecting gametocyte biology.
