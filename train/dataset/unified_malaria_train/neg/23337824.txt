plasmodium relictum widespread invasive agent avian malaria, responsible 
for acute, chronic debilitating diseases many species birds. recent
pcr-based studies revealed astonishing genetic diversity avian malaria
parasites (genus plasmodium), numerous genetic lineages deposited in
genbank. many studies addressed distribution evolutionary relationships of
avian plasmodium lineages, information patterns development of
different lineages mosquito vectors remains insufficient. present data
on sporogonic development 2 widespread mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages
(cyt b) p. relictum (psgs1 pgrw11) mosquito culex pipiens pipiens.
genetic distance lineages 0.2%; fall well-supported
clade phylogenetic tree. three p. relictum strains isolated from
common crossbill (loxia curvirostra, lineage psgs1), domestic canary (serinus
canaria domestica, psgs1) house sparrow (passer domesticus, pgrw11). these
strains multiplied domestic canaries used donors malarial
gametocytes infect c. p. pipiens. mosquitoes allowed take blood meal
on infected canaries dissected intervals study development of
sporogonic stages. 3 strains developed synchronously completed sporogony 
in vector, infective sporozoites reported salivary glands the
day 14 infection. ookinetes, oocysts sporozoites strains were
indistinguishable morphologically. study shows patterns sporogonic
development closely related lineages psgs1 pgrw11 different
strains lineage psgs1 p. relictum similar indicating that
phylogenetic trees based cyt b gene likely used predicting
sporogonic development genetically similar avian malaria lineages mosquito 
vectors.
