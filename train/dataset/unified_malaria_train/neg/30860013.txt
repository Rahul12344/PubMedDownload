prevalence risk factors associated polymerase chain reaction
(pcr)-determined plasmodium falciparum positivity assessed day 3 after
initiation treatment, pre-implementation 8 years post-deployment 
artemether-lumefantrine first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria in
bagamoyo district, tanzania. samples originated previously reported trials
conducted 2006 2014. cytochrome b-nested pcr used detect
malaria parasites blood samples collected filter paper day 3.
chi-square mcnemar chi-squared tests, logistic regression models, and
analysis variance used appropriate. primary outcome based the
proportion patients day 3 pcr-determined p. falciparum positivity.
overall, 256/584 (43.8%) screened patients day 3 pcr-determined
positivity, whereas 2/584 (0.3%) microscopy-determined asexual
parasitemia. day 3 pcr-determined positivity increased 28.0% (14/50) 2006
to 74.2% (132/178) 2007-2008 declined, thereafter, 36.0% (50/139) in
2012-2013 27.6% (60/217) 2014. data pooled, pretreatment
microscopy-determined asexual parasitemia ≥ 100,000/µl, hemoglobin < 10 g/dl, age
< 5 years, temperature ≥ 37.5°c, year study 2007-2008 2012-2013 were
significantly associated pcr-determined positivity day 3. significant
increases p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 n86 p. falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter k76 across years associated with
pcr-determined positivity day 3. statistically significant association 
observed day 3 pcr-determined positivity pcr-adjusted recrudescence. 
day 3 pcr-determined p. falciparum positivity remained common patients treated
before implementation artemether-lumefantrine bagamoyo district, 
tanzania. however, presence associated pretreatment characteristics.
