here, report application portable sequencer, minion, genotyping
the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. present study, amplicon
mixture nine representative genes causing resistance anti-malaria drugs 
diagnosed. first, developed procedure four laboratory strains (3d7,
dd2, 7g8, k1), applied developed procedure ten clinical
samples. sequenced re-sequenced samples using obsolete flow cell
r7.3 recent flow cell r9.4. although average base-call accuracy 
of minion sequencer 74.3%, performing >50 reads given position
improves accuracy snp call, yielding precision recall rate of
0.92 0.8, respectively, flow cell r7.3. numbers increased
significantly flow cell r9.4, precision recall 1 and
0.97, respectively. based snp information, drug resistance status in
ten clinical samples inferred. also analyzed k13 gene mutations 54
additional clinical samples proof concept. found novel
amino-acid changing variation dominant area. addition, performed
a small population-based analysis using 3 5 cases (k13) 10 5 cases
(pfcrt) thailand vietnam, respectively. identified distinct genotypes
from respective regions. approach change standard methodology
for sequencing diagnosis malaria parasites, especially developing
countries.
