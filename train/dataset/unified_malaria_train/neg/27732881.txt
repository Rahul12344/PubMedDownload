emerging resistance current anti-malarials necessitates detailed
understanding biological processes plasmodium falciparum proliferation,
thus allowing identification new drug targets. well-conserved protein
receptor activated c-kinase 1 (rack1) originally identified mammalian 
cells anchoring protein protein kinase c (pkc) since shown
to important cell migration, cytokinesis, transcription, epigenetics, 
protein translation. p. falciparum ortholog, pfrack1, expressed blood
stages parasite diffusely localized parasite cytoplasm.
using destabilizing domain allow inducible knockdown endogenous
protein level, evaluated requirement pfrack1 blood-stage
replication. following destabilization, parasites demonstrate nearly
complete growth arrest trophozoite stage. essential nature pfrack1 
suggests protein pathways regulated protein are
potential targets novel anti-malarial therapeutics.
