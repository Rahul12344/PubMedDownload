background: 2006, senegalese national malaria control programme
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) with
artemether-lumefantrine first-line treatment uncomplicated plasmodium 
falciparum malaria. date, multiple mutations associated artemisinin
delayed parasite clearance described southeast asia pfk13
gene, y493h, r539t, i543t c580y. even though act remains clinically
and parasitologically efficacious senegal, spread resistance is
possible shown earlier emergence resistance chloroquine in
southeast asia subsequently spread africa. therefore, surveillance of
artemisinin resistance malaria endemic regions crucial requires the
implementation sensitive tools, next-generation sequencing (ngs) which
can detect novel mutations low frequency.
methods: here, amplicon sequencing approach used identify mutations 
the pfk13 gene eighty-one p. falciparum isolates collected three
different regions senegal.
results: total, 10 snps around propeller domain identified; one
synonymous snp nine non-synonymous snps, two insertions. three these
snps (t478t, a578s v637i) located propeller domain. a578s, the
most frequent mutation observed africa, previously reported
in senegal. previous study suggested a578s could disrupt function 
of pfk13 propeller region.
conclusion: genetic basis possible artemisinin resistance may be
distinct africa southeast asia, studies necessary assess
the new snps reported study.
