plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) forms basis many
current malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts). however, parasites lacking
part pfhrp2 gene express pfhrp2 protein are,
therefore, identifiable pfhrp2-detecting rdts. evaluated the
performance sd bioline malaria ag p.f/pan rdt together pfhrp2
variation madagascar. genomic dna isolated 260 patient blood samples were
polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified parasite 18s rrna pfhrp2
genes. post-pcr ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay
(ldr-fma) performed identification parasite species. plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 amplicons sequenced. polymerase chain
reaction diagnosis patient samples showed 29% (75/260) infected 
p. falciparum present 95% (71/75) pcr-positive samples. comparing
rdt p. falciparum detection ldr-fma, eight samples rdt negative but
p. falciparum positive (false negatives), pfhrp2 positive. 
sensitivity specificity rdt 87% 90%, respectively.
seventy-three samples amplified pfhrp2, nine randomly
selected amplicons sequenced, yielding 13 sequences. amplification of
pfhrp2, combined rdt analysis p. falciparum detection ldr-fma, showed
that indication pfhrp2 deletion. sequence analysis pfhrp2
showed correlation pfhrp2 sequence structure rdt detection
rates unclear. although observed absence pfhrp2 deletion the
samples screened encouraging, continued monitoring efficacy the
sd bioline malaria ag p.f/pan rdt malaria diagnosis madagascar is
warranted.
