one major virulence factors malaria causing parasite the
plasmodium falciparum encoded erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1). is
translocated membrane infected erythrocytes expressed from
approximately 60 var genes mutually exclusive manner. switching var genes
allows parasite alter functional antigenic properties infected
erythrocytes, escape immune defense establish chronic infections.
we developed efficient method isolating var genes telomeric 
other genome locations adapting transformation-associated recombination (tar) 
cloning, analyzed sequenced. purpose, three
plasmids containing homologous sequence representing upstream regions 
of group a, b, c var genes sequence homologous conserved
acidic terminal segment (ats) var genes generated. co-transfection with
p. falciparum strain itg2f6 genomic dna yeast cells yielded 200 tar clones.
the relative frequencies clones group biased. clones were
screened pcr, well southern blotting, revealed clones missed by
pcr due sequence mismatches primers. selected clones transformed
into e. coli analyzed rflp end sequencing. physical analysis
of 36 clones revealed 27 distinct types potentially representing 50% var
gene repertoire. three clones selected sequencing assembled into
single var gene containing contigs. study demonstrates possible
to rapidly obtain repertoire var genes p. falciparum within single 
set cloning experiments. technique applied individual isolates 
which provide detailed picture diversity var genes field.
this powerful tool overcome obstacles cloning assembly of
multi-gene families simultaneously cloning member.
