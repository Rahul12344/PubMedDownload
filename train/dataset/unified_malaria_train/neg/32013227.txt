growing insecticide resistance malaria vectors threatening the
effectiveness insecticide-based interventions, including long lasting
insecticidal nets (llins). however, impact metabolic resistance the
effectiveness tools remains poorly characterized. using experimental hut
trials genotyping glutathione s-transferase resistance marker
(l119f-gste2), established gst-mediated resistance reducing the
efficacy llins anopheles funestus. hut trials performed cameroon
revealed piperonyl butoxide (pbo)-based nets induced significantly higher 
mortality pyrethroid resistant an. funestus pyrethroid-only nets.
blood feeding rate deterrence significantly higher llins than
control. genotyping l119f-gste2 mutation revealed that, permethrin-based 
nets, 119f-gste2 resistant mosquitoes greater ability blood feed than
susceptible opposite effect observed deltamethrin-based nets.
for olyset plus, significant association exophily observed in
resistant mosquitoes (or = 11.7; p < 0.01). furthermore, gste2-resistant
mosquitoes (cone assays) significantly survived permanet 2.0 (or = 2.1; p < 
0.01) permanet 3.0 (side) (or = 30.1; p < 0.001) olyset plus.
this study shows efficacy pbo-based nets (e.g., blood feeding
inhibition) pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors could impacted by
other mechanisms including gst-mediated metabolic resistance affected 
synergistic action pbo. mosaic llins incorporating gst inhibitor (diethyl
maleate) could help improve efficacy areas gst-mediated resistance.
