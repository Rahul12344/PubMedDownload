objective: investigate genetic polymorphism plasmodium vivax (p. vivax)
pvcsp pvmsp1 genes field isolates four endemic regions (north, east, 
west south) thailand.
methods: 152 p. vivax infected cases dried blood spots dna
extracted confirmed species-specific primer sets using multiplex pcr
method. pvmsp1 fragments f2 f3; pvcsp genotyped using rflp-pcr method.
results: totally amplified dna multiple genotypes pvmsp1 f2 and
pvmsp1 f3 12.50% 8.55%, respectively pvcsp 3.95%. overall 
frequency multiple genotypes 25%. 12 allele types pvmsp1 f2 
using alui enzyme digestion 8 size variations found pvmsp1 f3. the
isolates western region highly genetic diverse compare among all
isolates. predominant variant type pvcsp gene vk210 type.
conclusions: multiple genotypes common found thailand might
hide real genotype. pvcsp extensive genetic diversity this
study. however, pvmsp1 marker due multiple genotypes difficult be
analyzed. multiple genotypes findings might stem population migration
and vector species findings.
