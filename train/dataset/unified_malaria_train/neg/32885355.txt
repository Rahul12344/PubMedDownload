primary effusion lymphoma (pel), caused kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (kshv), presents lymphomatous effusion body cavities 
a poor prognosis. anti-malaria drug, artesunate, possesses anti-neoplastic
potential. therefore, aimed investigate effect kshv-infected pel
cell lines. artesunate inhibited cell growth viability pel cells, 
effect peripheral blood mononuclear cells less pronounced. artesunate
induced g1 phase arrest downregulating cyclin d1/d2, cdk2/6 c-myc.
artesunate increased reactive oxygen species dna damage, affect
the expression latent lytic genes kshv. exhibited cytotoxicity
through caspase-dependent -independent pathways reduced bcl-xl, survivin,
xiap c-iap1/2 levels. furthermore, artesunate suppressed nf-κb ap-1 by
inhibiting iκb kinase iκbα phosphorylation well junb expression.
finally, artesunate treatment attenuated pel development mice. data
support artesunate potential drug pel treatment.
