objective: analyze sequence variation construct phylogenetic tree based on
18s ribosomal dna among five species plasmodium yunnan border china
and myanmar areas.
methods: blood samples (or dna samples)from malaria patients collected 
2000 2015 yunnan border myanmar areas. dna extracted from
blood samples, 18s rdna fragment amplified, sequenced aligned
with relevant sequences available genbank. phylogenetic tree was
constructed methods neighbor joining (nj), maximum likelihood (ml), and
maximum parsimony (mp), respectively.
results: total 94 blood samples dna malaria patients collected.
the 18s rdna successfully amplified samples. sequence alignment 
revealed variations 0-0.2%, 0-0.1%, 0-0.1%, 0-0.1% 0 18s rdna sequence
among plasmodium falciparum, p. vivax, p. malariae, p. ovale p. knowlesi,
respectively. phylogenetic tree constructed three method showed
consistency. phylogenic analysis revealed five big branches of
plasmodium spp. studied. p. falciparum branch clustered isolates
from cameroon（kc428741, kc428742）, brazil（kc906718）, malaysia（hq283221） in
genbank. p. vivax branch clustered isolates cameroon（hf945443）,
india （hm014361, jq627158）, colombia （u83877）. however, samples pv11,
pv18 pv21 formed small branch showed closer phylogenetic relationship 
with p. cynomolgi（l07559）, isolate macaca fascicularis. moreover, p.
malariae samples yunnan province including pm1, pm3 pm4 clustered to
form small branch, clustered samples hainan province,
showing geographical diversity. isolates p. ovale clustered with
isolates vietnam（eu935736 af387038）. isolates p. knowlesi
clustered branch, showed close relationship myanmar
(gu816250 gu816246).
conclusion: significant difference 18s rdna gene five
species plasmodium yunnan border china myanmar other
areas. phylogenetic tree constructed nj, mp ml methods shows
consistency.
