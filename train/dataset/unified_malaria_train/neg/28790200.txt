the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum replicates within circulating
red blood cells, subjected conditions frequently cause dna
damage. repair dna double-stranded breaks (dsbs) thought rely almost
exclusively homologous recombination (hr), due lack efficient
nonhomologous end joining. however, given parasite haploid during
this stage life cycle, mechanisms involved maintaining genome
stability poorly understood. particular interest subtelomeric
regions chromosomes, contain majority multicopy variant
antigen-encoding genes responsible virulence disease severity. here, we
show parasites utilize competitive balance de novo telomere
addition, also called "telomere healing," hr stabilize chromosome ends.

dna sequences immediately surrounding break. combination, two repair
pathways enable parasites efficiently maintain chromosome stability also

we show parasites utilize two competing molecular mechanisms repair
double-strand breaks, homologous recombination de novo telomere addition,
with pathway used determined surrounding dna sequence. in
combination, two pathways balance need maintain genome stability
with selective advantage generating antigenic diversity.
