objectives: polymorphisms lysosomal transporter encoded pfcrt gene 
directly impact plasmodium falciparum susceptibility aminoquinolines. the
lys76thr mutation critical change conferring chloroquine resistance in
vitro vivo, always occurs additional non-synonymous changes in
the pfcrt coding sequence. sought better describe pfcrt polymorphisms
distal codon 76.
methods: small-volume samples (≤ 500 μl) parasite-infected blood collected
directly malaria patients presenting treatment sudan tanzania
were immediately preserved rna extraction. pfcrt locus amplified from
cdna preparations nested pcr sequenced directly derive full-length mrna
sequences.
results: one two sites sudan, two patients found unorthodox
spliced form pfcrt mrna two exons skipped, not
possible test presence putative protein products these
aberrant transcripts. genomic dna sequencing dried blood spots collected 
parallel confirmed presence spliced pfcrt pseudogenes minority of
parasite isolates. full-length cdna conventionally spliced mrna molecules in
all study sites demonstrated existence variety pfcrt haplotypes in
east africa, thus provides evidence intragenic recombination.
conclusions: presence pseudogenes, although unlikely direct
public health impact, may confound results obtained simple genotyping
methods consider codon 76 adjacent residues pfcrt.
