background: plasmodium falciparum parasites, could harbour anti-malaria
drug resistance genes, commonly detected blood donors malaria-endemic
areas. notwithstanding, anti-malaria drug resistant biomarkers been
characterized blood donors asymptomatic p. falciparum infection.
methods: total 771 blood donors selected five districts the
greater accra region, ghana. donor sample screened malaria rapid
diagnostic test (rdt) kit parasitaemia quantified microscopically. dried
blood spots malaria positive samples genotyped p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), p. falciparum multi-drug resistance
(pfmdr1), p. falciparum dihydropteroate-synthetase (pfdhps), p. falciparum
dihydrofolate-reductase (pfdhfr) kelch 13 propeller domain chromosome 13
(kelch 13) genes.
results: 771 blood donors, 91 (11.8%) positive rdt. analysis of
sequence reads indicated successful genotyping pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps
and kelch 13 genes 84.6, 81.3, 86.8, 86.9 92.3% isolates
respectively. overall, 21 different mutant haplotypes identified 69
isolates (75.8%). pfcrt, cviet haplotype observed 11.6% samples while
in pfmdr1, triple mutation (resulting yfn haplotype) detected 8.1% of
isolates. pfdhfr gene, triple mutation resulting irni haplotype in
pfdhps gene, quintuple mutation resulting agess haplotype identified in
17.7% parasite isolates. finally, five non-synonymous kelch 13 alleles were
detected; c580y (3.6%), p615l (4.8%), a578s (4.8%), i543v (2.4%) a676s (1.2%)
were detected.
conclusion: results obtained study indicated various frequencies of
mutant alleles pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps kelch 13 genes p.
falciparum infected blood donors. alleles could reduce efficacy of
standard malaria treatment transfusion-transmitted malaria cases.
incorporating malaria screening donor screening protocol defer infected
donors therefore recommended.
