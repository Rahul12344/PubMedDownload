the malaria mosquito, anopheles stephensi, mosquitoes modulate their
biology match time-of-day. present work, used non-hypothesis
driven approach (untargeted proteomics) identify proteins mosquito tissue, 
and quantified relative abundance identified proteins an.
stephensi bodies. using quantified protein levels, analyzed the
data proteins detectable certain times-of-the day,
highlighting need consider time-of-day experimental design. further, we
extended time-of-day analysis look proteins cycle rhythmic 
24-hour ("circadian") manner, identifying 31 rhythmic proteins. finally, to
maximize utility data, performed proteogenomic analysis to
improve genome annotation an. stephensi. compare peptides were
detected using mass spectrometry 'missing' an. stephensi
predicted proteome, reference proteomes 38 primarily human disease 
vector species. found 239 peptide matches reveal genome
annotation improved using proteogenomic analysis taxonomically
diverse reference proteomes. examination 'missing' peptides revealed reading
frame errors, errors gene-calling, overlapping gene models, suspected gaps
in genome assembly.
