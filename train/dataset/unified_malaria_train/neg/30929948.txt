plasmodium vivax (pv) second malaria causing pathogen among
plasmodium species. m18 aspartic aminopeptidase (m18aap) protein single gene
copy present plasmodium. protein functional terminal stage of
hemoglobin degradation host completes hydrolysis process makes
it important target new chemotherapeutics. experimental structural 
study m18aap protein p. vivax reported till today. paper advocates 
the application multiple computational approaches like protein model
prediction, ligand-based 3d qsar study, pharmacophore, structure-based virtual
screening molecular docking simulation identification potent lead
molecules enzyme. 3d qsar model developed using known
bioactive compounds pvm18aap protein statistically signify 
k-nn model q^2 = 0.7654. study reports lead molecule from
ligand-centric approach good binding affinity possessing lowest docking 
score. findings helpful in-vivo in-vitro validations and
development potent anti-malarial molecules drug resistant strains 
of malaria parasite.
