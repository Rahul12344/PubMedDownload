plasmodium falciparum isolates recently collected senegal gambia 
search signals selection malaria endemic region. found little
geographic temporal stratification genetic diversity among sampled 
parasites. application ihs rehh haplotype-based tests for
positive selection, found evidence recent selective sweeps known drug 
resistance locus, several known antigenic loci, several genomic regions
