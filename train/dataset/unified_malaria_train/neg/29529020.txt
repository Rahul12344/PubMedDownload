within human host, malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum exposed to
multiple selection pressures. host environment changes dramatically severe
malaria, extent parasite responds to-or selected by-this 
environment remains unclear. previous studies, parasites cause
severe malaria appear increase expression restricted poorly defined
subset pfemp1 variant, surface antigens. pfemp1s major targets of
protective immunity. here, used rna sequencing (rnaseq) analyse gene
expression 44 parasite isolates caused severe uncomplicated malaria
in papuan patients. transcriptomes 19 parasite isolates associated with
severe malaria indicated parasites decreased glycolysis without
activation compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure probably
transcriptional regulation decreased histone methylation; reduced surface
expression pfemp1; down-regulated expression multiple chaperone
proteins. rnaseq also identified novel associations disease severity 
and pfemp1 transcripts, domains, smaller sequence segments also confirmed
all previously reported associations expressed pfemp1 sequences and
severe disease. findings inform efforts identify vaccine targets
for severe malaria also indicate parasites adapt to-or selected
by-the host environment severe malaria.
