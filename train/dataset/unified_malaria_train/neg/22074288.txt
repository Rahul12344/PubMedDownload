objective: assess genotype prevalence multiplicity plasmodium
falciparum infections maritime region togo.
methods: enrolled 309 symptomatic individuals aged 6 months 15 years
from bè/lomé tsévié, two malaria endemic zones. number the
proportions merozoite surface proteins 1, 2 3 genotypes patients were
determined using capillary electrophoresis genotyping. investigated
the possible association transaminases homocysteine, severity
of disease.
results: 309 samples genotyped, 210 tested positive msp-1, 227 msp-2
and 193 msp-3. nested pcr revealed 22 different alleles allelic
family msp-1, 33 msp-2 13 msp-3. locus, family
distribution 54.58% k1, 25% mad20 20.42% ro33 msp-1, and
51.71% 48.29% fc27 3d7, respectively, msp-2. allelic
variants, distribution associated neither severity malaria
nor zone habitation. pearson correlation coefficients either the
levels homocysteine transaminase severity disease were
very low.
conclusion: severity malaria associated higher multiplicity
of infections appear restricted particular genotypes. more
comprehensive explorations including immunity, genetic factors, nutritional and
sociologic status population could clarify situation.
