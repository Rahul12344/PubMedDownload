analyzing molecular determinants plasmodium parasite cell death promising
approach exploring new avenues fight malaria. three major
forms cell death (apoptosis, necrosis autophagic cell death) been
described multicellular organisms cell death processes exist in
protozoa still matter debate. suggest three types of
cell death occur plasmodium liver-stage parasites. whereas typical molecular
markers apoptosis necrosis found genome of
plasmodium parasites, identified genes coding putative autophagy-marker
proteins thus concentrated autophagic cell death. characterized the
plasmodium berghei homolog prominent autophagy marker protein atg8/lc3 and
found localized apicoplast. relocalization pbatg8 to
autophagosome-like vesicles vacuoles appear dying parasites not,
however, observed. strongly suggests function protein in
liver-stage parasites restricted apicoplast biology.
