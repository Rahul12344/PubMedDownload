nearly half genes plasmodium falciparum genome yet been
functionally investigated. used homology-based structural modeling identify
multiple copies armadillo repeats within one uncharacterized gene expressed
during intraerythrocytic stages, pf3d7_0410600, subsequently referred as
p. falciparum armadillo-type repeat protein (pfatrp). soluble recombinant pfatrp 
was expressed bacterial expression system, purified apparent homogeneity 
and identity recombinant pfatrp confirmed mass spectrometry.
affinity-purified α-pfatrp rabbit antibodies specifically recognized the
recombinant protein. immunofluorescence assays revealed α-pfatrp rabbit
antibodies reacted p. falciparum schizonts. anti-pfatrp antibody exhibited
peripheral staining patterns around merozoites. given localization of
pfatrp merozoites, tested egress phenotype schizont arrest
assays demonstrated native pfatrp inaccessible surface of
merozoites intact schizonts. dual immunofluorescence assays markers for
the inner membrane complex (imc) microtubules suggest partial colocalization 
in asexual sexual stage parasites. using soluble recombinant pfatrp 
in screen plasma samples revealed malaria-infected children have
naturally acquired pfatrp-specific antibodies.
