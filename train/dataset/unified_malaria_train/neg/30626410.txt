background: resistance insecticides increases disease vectors, has
become exceedingly important monitor populations susceptibility. most
studies field populations aedes aegypti largely characterized
resistance patterns spatial scale city country, may be
completely informative given insecticide application occurs scale 
the house city block. phenotypic resistance pyrethroids dominates ae.
aegypti, partially explained mutations voltage-gated
sodium channel gene. here, assess community-level patterns four knockdown
resistance (kdr) haplotypes (c1534/i1016, f1534/i1016, c1534/v1016 and
f1534/v1016) ae. aegypti 24 randomly chosen city blocks city in
yucatán state, mexico, dry wet season two years.
results: three four haplotypes, c1534/i1016, c1534/v1016 f1534/v1016
were heterogeneous city blocks four sampling time points, 
double mutant haplotype, c1534/i1016, showed significant increase following the
wet season. f1534/i1016 haplotype rarely detected, similar other
studies. however, haplotype frequencies aggregated coarser spatial
scale, differences space time obscured.
conclusions: results provide empirical evidence selection kdr
alleles occurring fine spatial scales, indicating future studies
should include scale better understand evolutionary processes of
resistance natural populations.
