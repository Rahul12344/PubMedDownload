the rts,s candidate malaria vaccine protect controlled human malaria 
infection (chmi), protection achieved remains unclear. here, have
analyzed longitudinal peripheral blood transcriptome immunogenicity data from
a clinical efficacy trial healthy adults received three rts,s doses
4 weeks apart followed chmi 2 weeks later. multiway partial least squares
discriminant analysis (n-pls-da) transcriptome data identified 110 genes 
could used predictive models protection. among 110 genes, 42 had
known immune-related functions, including 29 related the
nf-κb-signaling pathway 14 ifn-γ-signaling pathway. post-dose 3 serum 
ifn-γ concentrations also correlated protection; n-pls-da of
ifn-γ-signaling pathway transcriptome data selected almost (44/45) the
representative genes predictive models protection. hence, the
identification nf-κb ifn-γ pathways provides insight 
vaccine-mediated protection may achieved.
