the combination piperaquine dihydroartemisinin recently become the
official first-line therapy several southeast asian countries. the
pharmacokinetic mismatching drugs, whose plasma half-lives ~20 days 
and ~1 h, respectively, implies recrudescent new infections emerging
shortly treatment cessation encounter piperaquine monotherapy
agent. creates substantial selection pressure emergence of
resistance. elucidate potential resistance determinants, subjected cloned
plasmodium falciparum dd2 parasites continuous piperaquine pressure vitro
(47 nm; ~2-fold higher dd2 50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)]). the
phenotype outgrowth parasites assayed two clones, revealing ic(50)
against piperaquine 2.1 μm 1.7 μm, 100-fold greater 
parent. identify genetic determinant resistance, employed
comparative whole-genome hybridization analysis. compared dd2 parent, this
analysis found (in resistant clones) novel single-nucleotide polymorphism 
in p. falciparum crt (pfcrt), deamplification 82-kb region chromosome 5 
(that includes pfmdr1), amplification adjacent 63-kb region of
chromosome 5. continued propagation without piperaquine selection pressure
resulted "revertant" piperaquine-sensitive parasites. retained pfcrt
polymorphism deamplified chromosome 5 segment encompasses
pfmdr1; however, two independently generated revertants lost the
neighboring 63-kb amplification. results suggest copy number
variation event chromosome 5 (825600 888300) associated piperaquine
resistance. transgene expression studies underway individual genes in
this segment evaluate contribution piperaquine resistance.
