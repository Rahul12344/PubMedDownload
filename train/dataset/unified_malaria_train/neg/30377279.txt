toxoplasma gondii infects approximately 30% world's population, causing
disease primarily pregnancy individuals weakened immune
systems. toxoplasma secretes exports effector proteins modulate host
during infection, several proteins processed the
golgi-associated aspartyl protease 5 (asp5). here, identify asp5 substrates by
selectively enriching n-terminally derived peptides wild-type δasp5
parasites. reveal 2,000 unique toxoplasma n-terminal peptides,
mapping natural n termini protease cleavage sites. several these
peptides mapped directly downstream characterized asp5 cleavage site,
arginine-arginine-leucine (rrl). validate candidates true asp5 substrates, 
revealing processed parasites lacking asp5 wild-type
parasites following mutation motif rrl arl. identified asp5
substrates dense granule proteins, interestingly, none appear be
exported, thus differing analogous system related plasmodium spp.
instead show majority substrates reside within parasitophorous
vacuole (pv), membrane (the pvm), including two kinases one

these virulence proteins require direct maturation aspartyl protease asp5,
and require asp5 translocation host cell, yet true number of

we selectively enrich n-terminally derived peptides using terminal amine isotopic
