blastocystis sp. common intestinal protist found worldwide variety of
animals, including humans. currently, 17 subtypes (sts) blastocystis isolates 
from mammalian avian host species reported based small
subunit ribosomal rna gene (ssu rdna). among these, human blastocystis 
identified among sts 1-9. except st9, sts comprised isolates from
humans animal species. entire sequence data ssu rdna nine
blastocystis isolates laboratory rats guinea pigs previously showed st4, 
whereas blastocystis isolates wild rodents addressed
genetically. study, blastocystis infection wild rodents surveyed
in indonesia japan, 11 12 rodent blastocystis parasites obtained
from rattus exulans r. novercious, respectively. new blastocystis
isolates wild rodents identified st4 based ssu rdna
sequences. best tree inferred entire sequences ssu rdna of
all st4 isolates including 17 data registered genbank clearly showed
monophyletic st4a st4b clades. although st4 isolates laboratory rats
were separated two clades, blastocystis isolates wild rodents
in present study positioned clade st4a separated
into two sub-clusters within clade st4a according location host
species. considering fact laboratory rats susceptible st4a 
and st4b, separation monophyletic sub-clusters blastocystis isolates
from indonesian polynesian rats japanese brown rats may indicate presence
of geographical variations rather host-specific separation. either way,
the robust host preference rodent species st4 blastocystis also
confirmed.
