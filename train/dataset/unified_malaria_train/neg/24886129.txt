background: malaria vector control sudan relies mainly indoor residual
spraying (irs) use long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (llins). 
monitoring insecticide resistance main sudanese malaria vector, anopheles 
arabiensis, essential planning implementing effective vector
control program country.
methods: susceptibility tests used monitor resistance insecticides
from four who-approved classes insecticide four sentinel sites in
gezira state three year period. insecticide resistance mechanisms were
studied using pcr microarray analyses.
results: susceptibility tests showed anopheles arabiensis sites
were fully susceptible bendiocarb fenitrothion duration the
study (2008-2011). however, resistance ddt pyrethroids detected at
three sites, strong seasonal variations evident sites. 1014 f kdr
allele significantly associated resistance pyrethroids ddt
(p < 0.001) extremely high effects sizes (or > 7 allelic tests). the
1014s allele detected populations tested. microarray
analysis permethrin-resistant population an. arabiensis wad medani
identified number metabolic genes significantly over-transcribed
in field-collected resistant samples compared susceptible
sudanese an. arabiensis dongola strain. included cyp6m2 cyp6p3, two
genes previously implicated pyrethroid resistance anopheles gambiae s.s,
and epsilon-class glutathione-s-transferase, gste4.
conclusions: data suggest target-site mechanisms metabolic
mechanisms play important role conferring pyrethroid resistance an.

have implicated resistance phenotype an. gambiae requires
