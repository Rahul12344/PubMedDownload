a number human genetic polymorphisms prevalent tropical populations and
appear offer protection symptomatic and/or severe malaria. compared
the prevalence four polymorphisms, sickle hemoglobin mutation (β globin
e6v), α-thalassemia 3.7kb deletion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency caused common african variant (g6pd a-), cd36 t188g
mutation 1344 individuals residing districts eastern (tororo),
south-central (jinja), southwestern (kanungu) uganda. genes interest 
amplified, amplicons subjected mutation-specific restriction endonuclease
digestion (for sickle hemoglobin, g6pd a-, cd36 t188g), reaction products
resolved electrophoresis, genotypes determined based sizes of
reaction products. mutant genotypes common, many heterozygous than
homozygous alleles identified. prevalences (heterozygotes plus homozygotes)
of sickle hemoglobin (28% tororo, 25% jinja, 7% kanungu), α-thalassemia (53%
tororo, 45% jinja, 18% kanungu) g6pd a- (29% tororo, 18% jinja, 8% kanungu)
were significantly greater tororo jinja compared kanungu (p<0.0001 
all three alleles); prevalences also significantly greater tororo
compared jinja α-thalassemia (p=0.03) g6pd a- (p<0.0001). cd36
t188g mutation, prevalence significantly greater tororo compared to
jinja kanungu (27% tororo, 17% jinja, 18% kanungu; p=0.0004 0.0017,
respectively). considering ethnicity study subjects, based primary language
spoken, prevalence mutant genotypes lower bantu compared to
non-bantu language speakers, jinja cohort, study population
with marked diversity language groups, prevalence differ between
bantu non-bantu speakers. results indicate marked differences human 
genetic features populations different regions uganda. these
differences might explained ethnic variation varied malaria
risk different regions uganda.
