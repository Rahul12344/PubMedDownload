the emergence plasmodium falciparum resistance artemisinin southeast
asia threatens malaria control elimination activities worldwide. multiple
polymorphisms p. falciparum kelch gene found chromosome 13 (pfk13) have
been associated artemisinin resistance. surveillance potential drug
resistance loci within population may emerge increasing drug
pressure important public health activity. context, p. falciparum
infections observational surveillance study senegal genotyped
using targeted amplicon deep sequencing (tads) pfk13 polymorphisms. the
results compared previously reported pfk13 polymorphisms around 
world. total 22 pfk13 propeller domain polymorphisms identified this
study, 12 previously reported. interestingly, 10
polymorphisms identified present study also previously reported,
all different amino acid substitution codon positions. the
polymorphisms present low frequencies confined single
isolates, suggesting likely transient polymorphisms part of
naturally evolving parasite populations. results study underscore the
need identify potential drug resistance loci existing within population,
which may emerge increasing drug pressure.
