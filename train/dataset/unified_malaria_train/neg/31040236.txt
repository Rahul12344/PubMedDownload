the clinical presentation severe plasmodium falciparum malaria differs between
children adults, mechanistic basis remains unclear.
contributing factors disease severity include total parasite biomass the
diverse cytoadhesive properties mediated polymorphic var gene parasite
ligand family displayed infected erythrocytes. explore factors, we
performed multicohort analysis contribution var expression and
parasite biomass severe malaria two previously published pediatric cohorts 
in tanzania malawi adult cohort india. machine learning analysis
revealed independent complementary roles var adhesion types parasite 
biomass adult pediatric severe malaria showed similar var
profiles, including upregulation group dc8 var, predict severe malaria
in adults children. among adults, patients multiorgan complications
presented infections significantly higher parasite biomass without
significant differences var adhesion types. conversely, pediatric patients
with specific complications showed distinct var signatures. cerebral malaria
patients showed broadly increased expression var genes, particular group 
and dc8 var, children severe malaria anemia classified based on
high transcription dc8 var only. study represents first large
multisite meta-analysis var expression, demonstrates presence of
common var profiles severe malaria patients different ages across distant
geographical sites, well syndrome-specific disease signatures. complex 
associations parasite biomass, var adhesion type, clinical
presentation revealed represent comprehensive picture far the
relationship cytoadhesion, parasite load, clinical
syndrome.importance p. falciparum malaria cause multiple disease
complications differ patient age. previous studies attempted to
address roles parasite adhesion biomass disease severity; however, 
these studies limited single geographical sites, is
limited understanding parasite adhesion biomass interact influence 
disease manifestations. meta-analysis, compared parasite disease
determinants african children indian adults. study demonstrates 
parasite biomass specific subsets var genes independently associated
with detrimental outcomes childhood adult malaria. also explored
how parasite var adhesion types biomass play different roles the
development specific severe malaria pathologies, including childhood cerebral 
malaria multiorgan complications adults. work represents largest 
study date role var adhesion types biomass severe
malaria.
