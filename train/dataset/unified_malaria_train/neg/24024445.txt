objective: understand deltamethrin resistance level, gts p450
metabolic detoxification enzyme activities, mutations para-type sodium
channel gene confers knockdown resistance (kdr) anopheles sinensis
mosquitoes malaria endemic areas along huaihe river anhui province,
china.
methods: an. sinensis adult mosquitoes collected lilou, mohekou tuohu
townships bengbu city, anhui province august september, 2011. the
insecticide resistance bioassays performed adult mosquitoes using 
standard susceptibility test diagnostic concentrations deltamethrin
0.05%, mosquito resistance status classified based who
resistance classification criteria. metabolic detoxification enzyme
activities measured randomly selected mosquitoes, iis6 region 
the para-type sodium channel gene amplified pcr sequenced detect
mutations codon 1014.
results: knockdown rates within 60 min exposure deltamethrin test paper
were 4.1%, 7.0% 8.2%, mortality rates 8.2%, 12.0% 12.8% 
mosquitoes collected lilou, mohekou tuohu townships, respectively. these
three populations classified highly resistant populations based the
who resistance classification criteria. gst p450 enzyme activities the
three populations significantly higher susceptible
laboratory population (p < 0.001). l1014c l1014f mutations detected, and
the wild type homozygote kdr genotype found. three populations
exhibited small insignificant difference kdr allele frequencies. no
mutation found laboratory susceptible mosquitos.
conclusion: an. sinensis mosquito populations regions along the
huaihe river anhui province strongly resistant pyrethroid insecticides,
and exhibit significantly higher metabolic detoxification enzyme activities 
the laboratory susceptible population. high frequency kdr mutation is
identified mosquito populations region along huaihe river 
anhui province, china.
