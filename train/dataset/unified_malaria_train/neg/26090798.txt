the functional characterisation essential genes apicomplexan parasites,
such toxoplasma gondii plasmodium falciparum, relies conditional
mutagenesis systems. present novel strategy based u1 snrnp-mediated 
gene silencing. u1 snrnp critical pre-mrna splicing defining the
exon-intron boundaries. u1 recognition site placed 3'-terminal
exon adjacent termination codon, pre-mrna cleaved 3'-end 
degraded, leading efficient knockdown gene interest (goi). here
we describe simple method combines endogenous tagging dicre-mediated 
positioning u1 recognition sites adjacent termination codon goi 
which leads conditional knockdown goi upon rapamycin-induction.
specific knockdown mutants reporter gene gfp several endogenous genes 
of t. gondii including clathrin heavy chain gene 1 (chc1), vacuolar
protein sorting gene 26 (vps26), dynamin-related protein c gene (drpc)
were silenced using approach demonstrate potential this
technology. also discuss advantages disadvantages method in
comparison technologies detail.
