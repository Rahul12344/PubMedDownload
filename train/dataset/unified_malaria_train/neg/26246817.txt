background: carboxy-terminal 42 kda region plasmodium vivax merozoite surface 
protein-1 considered important antigen blood stage. since, this
region observed polymorphic among isolates p. vivax, is
significant survey different regions antigen various areas of
the world.
methods: present study, genetic diversity cloned pvmsp-142 kda gene
from iranian patient analyzed. parasite dna extracted p. vivax -
infected patient iran. region pvmsp-142 kda amplified pcr,
cloned ptz57r/t vector sequenced.
results: sequencing cloned pvmsp-142 kda gene clearly high degree of
homology (95%) reference sal-i sequence also homogeneous
sequences studied countries (97%). thirty eight snps (single nucleotide
polymorphism) identified cloned pvmsp-142 kda gene mutations
had localized 33 kda fragment (pvmsp-133 kda), nearly no
variation 19 kda fragment (pvmsp-119 kda). 2 38 mutations were
found novel haplotypes.
conclusion: high similarity cloned pvmsp-142 kda gene comparison to
reference sequence sequences could beneficial remarkable
molecular marker serological diagnostic kits p. vivax malarious
neighboring countries iran around world.
