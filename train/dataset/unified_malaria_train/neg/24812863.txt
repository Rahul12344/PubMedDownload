objective: identify species malaria parasites 5 imported cases
previously diagnosed vivax malaria.
methods: epidemiological information blood samples collected five
patients returned africa diagnosed vivax malaria. the
detection conducted microscopy, right view rapid malaria test (rdts) and
nested pcr plasmodium genus-specific species-specific primers. the
amplified products sequenced blast analysis performed.
results: three 5 cases history malaria attack. microscopically, 4
cases confirmed plasmodium ovale infection, 1 (case 1) co-infected
with p. vivax p. ovale. 5 cases showed negative rdt results. nested pcr
detection revealed 5 cases p. ovale-specific fragment (800 bp),
while case 1 p. vivax-specific fragment (120 bp) concurrently. blast
analysis showed amplified sequence 5 cases high sequence
homology (99%) p. ovale gene small subunit ribosomal rna genbank,
and case 1 also shared 99% homology p. vivax isolate sv5 18s
ribosomal rna gene (genbank accession number: jq627157.1).
conclusion: among five cases, four infected plasmodium ovale, one
was co-infected p. vivax p. ovale.
