the relapsing fever spirochete borrelia turicatae possesses complex life cycle 
in soft-bodied tick vector, ornithodoros turicata. spirochetes enter tick
midgut blood meal, and, following weeks, spirochetes
disseminate throughout o. turicata. population persists salivary glands 
allowing rapid transmission mammalian hosts tick feeding.
little known physiological environment within salivary glands
acini b. turicatae persists. study, examined salivary
gland transcriptome o. turicata ticks detected expression 57 genes 
involved oxidant metabolism antioxidant defences. confirmed the
expression five highly expressed genes, including glutathione
peroxidase (gpx), thioredoxin peroxidase (tpx), manganese superoxide dismutase
(sod-1), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (sod-2), catalase (cat) by
reverse-transcriptase droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (rt-ddpcr). we
also found distinct differences expression genes comparing
the salivary glands midguts unfed o. turicata ticks. results indicate 
that salivary glands unfed o. turicata nymphs highly oxidative
environments reactive oxygen species (ros) predominate, whereas midgut
tissues comprise primarily nitrosative environment nitric oxide synthase 
is highly expressed. additionally, b. turicatae found hyperresistant to
ros compared lyme disease spirochete borrelia burgdorferi, suggesting it
is uniquely adapted highly oxidative environment o. turicata salivary
gland acini.
