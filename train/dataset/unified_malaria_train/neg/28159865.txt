testes-biased genes evolve rapidly important establishment,
solidification, maintenance reproductive isolation incipient
species. anopheles gambiae complex, group least eight isomorphic
mosquito species endemic sub-saharan africa, excellent system explore
the evolution testes-biased genes. within group, testes an
important tissue diversification process hybridization between
species results sterile hybrid males, fully fertile females. conducted 
rna sequencing a. gambiae a. merus carcass testes explore tissue-
and species-specific patterns gene expression. data provides support for
transcriptional repression x-linked genes male germline, likely
drives demasculinization x chromosome. testes-biased genes predominately
function cellular differentiation show number interesting patterns
indicative rapid evolution, including elevated dn/ds values, low
evolutionary conservation, poor annotation existing reference genomes, a
high likelihood differential expression species.
