background: plasmodium falciparum encoded histidine rich protein (hrp2) based
malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) used india. deletion pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes contributes false negative test results, large numbers of
such deletions reported south america, highlighting importance
of surveillance detect deletions.
methods: first prospective field study carried 16 sites
located eight endemic states india assess performance pfhrp2
based rdt kits used national malaria control programme. study,
microscopically confirmed p. falciparum rdt negative samples assessed
for presence pfhrp2, pfhrp3, flanking genes using pcr.
results: among 1521 microscopically positive p. falciparum samples screened, 50
were negative hrp2 based rdt test. molecular testing carried using
these 50 rdt negative samples assuming 1471 rdt positive samples carried 
pfhrp2 gene. found 2.4% (36/1521) 1.8% (27/1521) samples 
negative pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes, respectively. however, frequency of
pfhrp2 deletions varied sites ranging 0-25% (2.4, 95% ci;
1.6-3.3). frequency pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletion varied 0-8% 
(1.6, 95% ci; 1.0-2.4).
conclusion: study provides evidence low level presence pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 deleted p. falciparum parasites different endemic regions india, and
periodic surveillance warranted reliable use pfhrp2 based rdts.
