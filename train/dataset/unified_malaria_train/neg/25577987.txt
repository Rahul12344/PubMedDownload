the knowledge diversity haemosporidian parasites primary
importance representatives include agents bird malaria. we
investigated occurrence haemoproteus spp. plasmodium spp. bird
populations single locality state selangor, peninsular malaysia,
and report parasite prevalence two genera. combination methods
(molecular morphological) used detecting parasites.
seventy-nine bird individuals caught using mist-nets july august 2010
at gombak field station university malaya, kuala lumpur. total, 23
birds identified positive haemoproteus plasmodium infection and
one individual recognized carrying mixed infection. total prevalence
of haemosporidians collected samples 30.3%. infections parasites 
of genus haemoproteus predominant compared genus
plasmodium. total, 10 new cyt b lineages haemoproteus spp. 3 new cyt b 
lineages plasmodium spp. recorded study. recorded
haemosporidian lineages (16 total), 3 known previous studies -
hcoll2, hywt2 pnilsun1. two linked corresponding
morphospecies - haemoproteus pallidus (coll2) haemoproteus motacillae (ywt2).
the morphological analysis present study confirmed results obtained by
the pcr method relative prevalence, 25.3% total prevalence of
haemoproteus plasmodium parasites. intensities infection varied
between 0.01% 19%. infections light, intensities 0.1%.
the present study first molecular survey protozoan blood parasites 
of order haemosporida recorded malaysia.
