cell surface structures termed knobs one important pathogenesis
related protein complexes deployed malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum 
at surface infected erythrocyte. despite relevance the
disease, structure, mechanisms traffic process assembly
remain poorly understood. study, explored possible role 
parasite-encoded hsp40 class chaperone, namely pfb0090c/pf3d7_0201800
(kahsp40) protein trafficking infected erythrocyte. found gene
coding pf3d7_0201800 located chromosomal cluster together with
knob components kahrp pfemp3. like knob components, kahsp40 showed
the presence pexel motif required transport erythrocyte
compartment. indeed, sub-cellular fractionation immunofluorescence analysis
(ifa) showed kahsp40 exported erythrocyte cytoplasm stage
dependent manner localizing punctuate spots erythrocyte periphery,
distinctly maurer's cleft, structures could reminiscent of
knobs. double ifa analysis revealed co-localization pf3d7_0201800 the
markers knobs (kahrp, pfemp1 pfemp3) components pexel
translocon (hsp101, ptex150). kahsp40 also found complex with
kahrp, pfemp3 hsp101 confirmed co-immunoprecipitation assay. our
results suggest potential involvement parasite encoded hsp40 chaperoning 
knob assembly erythrocyte compartment.
