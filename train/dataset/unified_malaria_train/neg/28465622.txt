commercial malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) detect p. falciparum histidine
rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) cross react pfhrp3, structural homologue.
here, analysed natural variations pfhrp2 pfhrp3 sequences indian
isolates correlated variations rdt reactivity. total 1392â€‰p.
falciparum positive samples collected eight endemic states pcr
amplified pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes sequenced. deduced protein
sequences analysed repeat variations correlated rdt reactivity.
out 1392 pcr amplified samples, single sample pfhrp2 negative two
samples pfhrp3 negative. complete pfhrp2 pfhrp3 sequences obtained 
for 769 samples 750 samples, respectively. total 16 distinct repeat
motifs observed pfhrp2 11 pfhrp3, including new repeat
types. correlation found variations size pfhrp2 repeat
types 2 7, combinations repeat motifs, performance 
a commercial rdt low parasite densities. findings suggest sequence
diversity pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes indian isolates likely to
negatively influence performance currently used pfhrp2 rdts.
