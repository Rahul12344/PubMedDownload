a first generation crispr-based gene drives tested the
laboratory number organisms, including malaria vector mosquitoes.
challenges use area-wide genetic control vector-borne disease
have identified, including development target site resistance, 
long-term efficacy field, molecular complexity, practical and
legal limitations field testing gene drive coupled anti-pathogen 
traits. evaluated theoretically concept integral gene drive (igd) 
as alternative paradigm population replacement. igds incorporate minimal
set molecular components, including drive anti-pathogen effector elements 
directly embedded within endogenous genes - arrangement theory allows 
targeting functionally conserved coding sequences without disrupting their
function. autonomous non-autonomous igd strains could generated,
optimized, regulated imported independently. performed quantitative
modeling comparing igds classical replacement drives show selection
for function hijacked host gene significantly reduce the
establishment resistant alleles population, drive occurring at
multiple genomic loci prolongs duration transmission blockage face 
of pre-existing target site variation. igd thus potential durable
and flexible population replacement strategy.
