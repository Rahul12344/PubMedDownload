artemisinin, sesquiterpene lactone produced artemisia annua glandular
secretory trichomes, active ingredient effective treatment for
uncomplicated malaria caused plasmodium falciparum parasites. other
metabolites a. annua related species, particularly flavonoids, been
proposed either act antimalarials act synergistically 
artemisinin enhance antimalarial activity. identified mutation that
disrupts chalcone isomerase 1 (chi1) enzyme responsible the
second committed step flavonoid biosynthesis. detailed metabolite profiling
revealed chi1-1 lacks major flavonoids produces wild-type
artemisinin levels, making mutant useful tool test antiplasmodial
effects flavonoids. used whole-leaf extracts chi1-1 mutant lines
impaired artemisinin production bioactivity vitro assays against
intraerythrocytic p. falciparum dd2. found chi1-1 extracts differ
from wild-type extracts antiplasmodial efficacy initial rate cytocidal 
action. furthermore, extracts a. annua cyp71av1-1 mutant rnai lines 
impaired amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene expression, severely 
compromised artemisinin biosynthesis unaffected flavonoid metabolism,
showed low antiplasmodial activity. results demonstrate 
vitro bioactivity p. falciparum flavonoids negligible compared
to artemisinin.
