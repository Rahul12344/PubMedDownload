lung cancer world's leading cause cancer-related morbidity and
mortality despite advances surgery, chemotherapy immunotherapy; thus,
there urgent need find new molecules develop novel treatment
strategies. although ncrnas found account 98% transcripts, number
of lncrnas distinct function lung cancer extremely limited. we
previously demonstrated plasmodium infection inhibits tumour growth and
metastasis, exact mechanisms involved fully understood. 
this study, carried rna sequencing (rna-seq) tumour tissues isolated
from llc tumour-bearing mice treated either plasmodium yoelli (py)-infected 
red blood cells uninfected red blood cells. found f630028o10rik
(abbreviated f63) novel lncrna significantly up-regulated in
tumours isolated mice treated py-infected red blood cells compared to
the control. using gene silencing technique, f63 found inhibit both
tumour vascular endothelial growth factor (vegfa) secretion endothelial
cells clone formation, migration, invasion tube formation. injection of
cholesterol-modified sirna-f63 mice tumour tissues produced significant
increase tumour volume, blood vessel formation angiogenesis 17 days 
injection. showed inhibiting mir-223-3p results the
down-regulation vegfa vegfr2 vital molecules angiogenesis.
these results reveal f63 inhibit tumour growth progression modulating
tumour angiogenesis suggesting f63 novel lncrna great potential 
a candidate molecule gene therapy lung cancer.
