background: gametocytes, blood stages responsible plasmodium falciparum
transmission, contain electron dense organelles, traditionally named osmiophilic 
bodies, believed involved gamete egress host cell. 
order provide novel tools cellular molecular studies osmiophilic
body biology, p. falciparum transgenic line organelles are
specifically marked reporter protein produced characterized.
methodology: p. falciparum transgenic line expressing 80-residue n-terminal 
fragment osmiophilic body protein pfg377 fused reporter protein
dsred, control pfg377 upstream downstream regulatory regions,
was produced.
results: transgenic fusion protein expressed appropriate time and
stage sexual differentiation trafficked osmiophilic bodies the
endogenous pfg377 protein. results indicate relatively small
n-terminal portion pfg377 sufficient target dsred reporter the
gametocyte osmiophilic bodies.
conclusions: first identification p. falciparum aminoacid
sequence able mediate trafficking organelles. fluorescently tag
such poorly characterized organelles opens novel avenues cellular imaging 
studies biogenesis role gamete egress.
