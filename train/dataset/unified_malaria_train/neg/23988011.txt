background: studies conducted pakistan determine efficacy
of chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), remain use as
treatment plasmodium vivax combination artesunate treat
plasmodium falciparum, respectively. study, samples several sites
across pakistan characterized determine prevalence molecular
resistance markers p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter
(pfcrt), multidrug resistance (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and
dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes origin chloroquine-resistant
p. falciparum parasites.
methods: microscopy-confirmed malaria parasite-positive blood samples 801
patients across country collected 2011. these, 171 infections were
identified polymerase chain reaction (pcr) p. falciparum analysed by
pyrosequencing mutations conferring chloroquine resistance (pfcrt codons
72-76), multidrug resistance (pfmdr1 n86y, y184f, s1034c, n1042d d1246y),
pyrimethamine resistance (pfdhfr, c50r, n51i, c59r, s108n i164l) and
sulphadoxine resistance (pfdhps, s436a, a437g, k540e, a581g a613t/s). pfmdr1 
gene copy number variation determined real-time pcr, microsatellites
flanking pfcrt locus typed determine origin the
chloroquine-resistant haplotype.
results: pfcrt k76t mutation found samples part the
s72/v73/m74/n75/t76 (svmnt) haplotype. microsatellites flanking pfcrt showed high
similarity signature found india papua new guinea. pfmdr1 n86y 
found 20% samples samples harboured single copy pfmdr1
gene. pfdhfr double mutation c59r + s108n present 87% samples while
the pfdhfr triple mutant (n51i + c59r + s108n) detected. pfdhps a437g was
found 60% samples. pure pfdhps k540e rare, 4%, mixed genotype
540 k/e found 77% samples. similarly, pure pfdhps a581g found 4%
of isolates mixed 581a/g found 39% samples.
conclusions: results suggest emerging problem multidrug resistant
p. falciparum pakistan. chloroquine resistance genotype reached
complete fixation population, microsatellite pattern indicative 
a selective sweep. moreover, prevalence mutations pfdhfr and
pfdhps, albeit without presence pfdhfr triple mutant, indicates that
continued monitoring warranted assess whether sp remains efficacious a
partner drug artesunate treatment p. falciparum.
