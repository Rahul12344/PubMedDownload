pre-erythrocytic immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria likely be
mediated t-cell recognition malaria epitopes presented infected host
cells via class ii major histocompatibility complex (mhc) antigens. test
for associations human leukocyte antigen (hla) alleles disease severity, 
we performed high-resolution typing hla class ii loci compared the
distributions alleles hla-a, -b, -c -drb1 loci 359 malian children
of dogon ethnicity uncomplicated severe malaria. observed alleles
a*30:01 a*33:01 higher frequency group patients cerebral
disease compared patients uncomplicated disease [a*30:01: gf = 0.2031 vs 
gf = 0.1064, odds ratio (or) = 3.17, p = 0.004, confidence interval (ci)
(1.94-5.19)] [a*33:01: gf = 0.0781 vs gf = 0.0266, 4.21, p = 0.005, ci
(1.89-9.84)], respectively. a*30:01 a*33:01 alleles share sequence
motifs a*30:01 appears unique peptide binding repertoire compared
to a*30 group alleles. computer algorithms predicted malaria peptides 
strong binding affinity hla-a*30:01 hla-a*33:01 closely
related alleles. conclusion, identified a*30:01 a*33:01 potential
susceptibility factors cerebral malaria, providing evidence that
polymorphism mhc genes results altered malaria susceptibility.
