background: current challenge gene annotation define gene function
in context network relationships instead using single genes. the
inference gene networks (gns) emerged approach better understand 
the biology system study several components network
interact keep functions stable. however, general
there sufficient data accurately recover gns expression
levels leading curse dimensionality, number variables
is higher samples. one way mitigate problem integrate
biological data instead using expression profiles inference
process. nowadays, use several biological information inference methods
had significant increase order better recover connections between
genes reduce false positives. makes strategy interesting 
the possibility confirming known connections included
biological data, possibility discovering new relationships between
genes observed expression data. although several works data
integration increased performance network inference methods, 
real contribution adding type biological information obtained
improvement clear.
methods: propose methodology include biological information an
inference algorithm order assess prediction gain using biological
information expression profile together. also evaluated compared the
gain adding four types biological information: (a) protein-protein
interaction, (b) rosetta stone fusion proteins, (c) kegg (d) kegg+go.
results conclusions: work presents first comparison gain the
use prior biological information inference gns considering the
eukaryote (p. falciparum) organism. results indicates information based 
on direct interaction produce higher improvement gain data
about less specific relationship go kegg. also, expected, results 
show use biological information important approach 
improvement inference. also compared gain inference the
global network hubs. results indicates use of
biological information improve identification connected
proteins.
