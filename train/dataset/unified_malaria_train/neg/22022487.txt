antimalarial drug resistance major obstacle malaria control eventual 
elimination. routine surveillance molecular marker resistance an
efficient way assess drug efficacy, remains feasible areas where
malaria control interventions succeeded substantially reducing malaria
transmission. community based asexual parasite prevalence surveys conducted 
annually sentinel sites gaza province, mozambique 2006 2010,
before, antimalarial policy changes artesunate plus
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 2006 artemether-lumefantrine 2008. genetic
analysis dhfr, dhps, crt, mdr1 resistant genes conducted 3 331
(14.4%) plasmodium falciparum pcr positive samples collected study
period 23 229 children aged 2 15 years. quintuple dhfr/dhps mutation 
associated sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance increased 56.2% at
baseline 75.8% 2010. baseline crt76t mdr186y mutants were
approaching fixation, 96.1% 74.7%, respectively. following deployment 
artemisinin-based combination therapy, prevalence these
chloroquine-resistance markers began declining, reaching 32.4% 30.9%,
respectively, 2010. samples analysed 5-year period possessed a
single copy mdr1 gene. high increasing prevalence quintuple
mutation supports change drug policy artesunate plus
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine artemether-lumefantrine mozambique. as
chloroquine related drug pressure decreased region, molecular
markers associated chloroquine resistance (crt76t mdr186y). however,
this reversion wild-type mdr186n predisposes parasites towards developing 
lumefantrine resistance. close monitoring artemether-lumefantrine efficacy 
therefore essential, particularly given high drug pressure within region 
where countries use artemether-lumefantrine first line treatment.
