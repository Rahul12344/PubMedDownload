development drug resistance p. falciparum one major problems
associated malaria treatment. parasite genetic factors single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) copy number variations (cnv) shown their
role drug resistance. studies focused role snps and
drug resistance parasite. however, also shown cnv is
associated adaptation drug resistance parasite. hence, exploration of
copy number polymorphism essential genes p. falciparum role in
anti-malarial resistance important. review provides recent
information related genetic profile cnv marker plasmepsin other
genes associated drugresistanceinp. falciparum. may suggested that
cnvs plasmepsin genes major driver piperaquine resistance.
moreover, cnvs pfcrt pfmdr1genes appear play important role in
adaptation hence survival parasite. may hypothesized that
targeting cnv formation parasite could beneficial breakdown of
its adaption response drug pressure.
