background: emergence spread artemisinin resistance plasmodium
falciparum poses threat malaria eradication, including china's plan to
eliminate malaria 2020. piperaquine (ppq) resistance emerged cambodia, 
compromising important partner drug widely used china form
of dihydroartemisinin (dha)-ppq. several mutations p. falciparum gene
encoding kelch protein chromosome 13 (k13) associated artemisinin
resistance arisen spread great mekong subregion, including the
china-myanmar border. multiple copies the plasmepsin ii/iii (pm2/3) genes,
located chromosome 14, shown associated ppq resistance.
methods: therapeutic efficacy dha-ppq treatment uncomplicated
p. falciparum evaluated along china-myanmar border 2010 2014. the
dry blood spots samples collected efficacy study prior dha-ppq treatment
and local hospital passive detection used amplify k13 and
pm2. polymorphisms within k13 genotyped capillary sequencing pm2 copy
number quantified relative-quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction. treatment outcome evaluated world health organization
protocol. linear regression model used estimate association 
the day 3 positive rate k13 mutation relationship pm2 copy
number variants k13 mutations.
results: dha-ppq effective uncomplicated p. falciparum infection in
yunnan province cure rates > 95%. twelve non synonymous mutations k13
domain observed among 268 samples prevalence 44.0% the
predominant mutation f446i prevalence 32.8%. one sample was
observed multi-copies of pm2, including parasites and
without k13 mutations. therapeutic efficacy dha-ppq was > 95% along the
china-myanmar border, consistent lack amplification pm2.
conclusion: dha-ppq uncomplicated p. falciparum infection still showed
efficacy area artemisinin-resistant malaria along china-myanmar
border. evidence show ppq resistance clinical study and
molecular markers survey. continued monitoring parasite population using
molecular markers important track emergence spread resistance
in region.
