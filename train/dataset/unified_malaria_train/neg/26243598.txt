obesity increased continuously western countries last several
decades recently become problem developing countries. currently,
anti-obesity drugs originating natural products investigated for
their potential overcome adverse effects associated chemical drugs.
artemisinic acid, isolated well-known anti-malaria herb
artemisia annua (aa) l., recently shown possess anti-adipogenic effects in
vitro. however, anti-adipogenic effects aa animal models yet
been investigated. therefore, conducted daily oral administration aa
water extract diet-induced obesity animal model treated 3t3-l1 cells
with aa confirm anti-adipogenic effects related protein
expressions. evaluated physiology, adipose tissue histology mrna 
expressions many related genes. inhibition adipogenesis aa water
extract observed vitro. animal model, weight gain significantly
lower aa treated group, changes food intake volume or
calories. reductions lipid droplet size mrna expression associated with
adipogenesis also observed animal epididymal fat. study first
to report aa anti-obese effects vivo.
