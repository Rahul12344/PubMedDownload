background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) account two-thirds of
malaria diagnoses africa. deletions plasmodium falciparum hrp2 (pfhrp2)
gene cause false-negative rdt results never investigated a
national level. spread pfhrp2-deleted p. falciparum mutants, resistant to
detection hrp2-based rdts, would represent serious threat malaria
elimination efforts.
methods: using nationally representative cross-sectional study 7,137
children five years age democratic republic congo (drc), 
tested 783 subjects rdt-/pcr+ results using pcr assays detect confirm
deletions pfhrp2 gene. spatial population genetic analyses were
employed examine distribution evolution parasites.
results: identified 149 pfhrp2-deleted parasites, representing 6.4% p. 
falciparum infections country-wide (95% confidence interval 5.1-8.0%). bayesian
spatial analyses identified statistically significant clustering pfhrp2
deletions near kinshasa kivu. population genetic analysis revealed
significant genetic differentiation wild-type pfhrp2-deleted parasite
populations (gst = .046, p ≤ .00001).
conclusions: pfhrp2-deleted p. falciparum common cause rdt-/pcr+ malaria 
among asymptomatic children drc appears clustered within select 
communities. surveillance deletions needed, alternatives to
hrp2-specific rdts may necessary.
