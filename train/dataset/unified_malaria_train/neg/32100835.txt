background: chloroquine (cq) generally prescribed front-line
antimalarial drug choice treat plasmodium vivax infections; however, some
clinical cq-resistant p. vivax isolates indigenously reported around
the world last decade.
methods: study, p. vivax isolates (n=52) obtained autochthonous
samples southeast iran 2015-2017. genomic dna samples was
extracted, amplified (nested pcr) sequenced targeting the
multidrug-resistance 1 gene. verify global genetic diversity of
cq-resistant p. vivax strains, sequences pvmdr1 originating asia 
the americas retrieved.
results: total 46 haplotypes grouped three distinct geographical
haplogroups. haplotype diversity occurrence rates pvmdr1 976f/1076l
mutations indicate efficacy cq compromised mexico, china,
nicaragua, thailand, brazil (2016), ethiopia, mauritania (2012) southwest
india near future. cladistic phylogenetic tree showed pvmdr1
sequences isolated southeast asian clade partial sister
relationship american clade.
conclusions: current findings serve basis develop appropriate
malaria control strategies public health policies symptomatic imported
malaria cases plausible cq-resistant p. vivax strains.
