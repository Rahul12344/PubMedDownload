the phylum apicomplexa contains group protozoa causing diseases humans
and livestock. plasmodium spp., causative agent malaria, contains a
mitochondrion divergent hosts. malarial
mitochondrion clinically validated target antimalarial drug
atovaquone, specifically blocks electron transfer activity bc1
complex mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtetc). mtetc
proteins nuclear-encoded imported cytosol, three key protein
subunits encoded plasmodium mitochondrial genome: cyt b, coxi, and
coxiii. translated inside mitochondrion mitochondrial ribosomes
(mitoribosomes). here, characterize function one large mitoribosomal
protein plasmodium falciparum, pfmrpl13. found pfmrpl13 localizes to
the parasite mitochondrion refractory genetic knockout. ablation of
pfmrpl13 using conditional knockdown system (tetr-dozi-aptamer) caused series
of adverse events parasite, including mtetc deficiency, loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (δψm), death. pfmrpl13 knockdown
parasite also became hypersensitive proguanil, drug proposed target an
alternative process maintaining δψm surprisingly, transmission em revealed
that pfmrpl13 disruption also resulted unusually elongated branched
mitochondrion. growth arrest knockdown parasite could rescued 
a second copy pfmrpl13, supplementation decylubiquinone or
addition yeast dihydroorotate dehydrogenase gene. summary, provide
first direct evidence mitoribosomes essential malaria parasites 
to maintain structural functional integrity mitochondrion.
