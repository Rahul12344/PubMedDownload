a vaccine candidate elicits humoral cellular responses multiple
sporozoite liver-stage antigens may able confer protection against
plasmodium falciparum malaria; however, technology formulating and
delivering vaccine remained elusive. here, report preclinical
assessment optimized dna vaccine approach targets four p. falciparum
antigens: circumsporozoite protein (csp), liver stage antigen 1 (lsa1),
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (trap), cell-traversal protein for
ookinetes sporozoites (celtos). synthetic dna sequences designed for
each antigen modifications improve expression delivered using in
vivo electroporation (ep). immunogenicity evaluated mice nonhuman
primates (nhps) assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), gamma 
interferon (ifn-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (elispot) assay, flow
cytometry. mice, dna ep delivery induced antigen-specific ifn-γ
production, measured elispot assay igg seroconversion all
antigens. sustained production ifn-γ, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor
alpha elicited cd4(+) cd8(+) cell compartments.
furthermore, hepatic cd8(+) lymphocytes produced lsa1-specific ifn-γ. immune 
responses conferred mice approach translated nhp model, which
showed cellular responses elispot assay intracellular cytokine staining.
notably, antigen-specific cd8(+) granzyme b(+) cells observed nhps.
collectively, data demonstrate delivery gene sequences dna/ep
encoding malaria parasite antigens immunogenic animal models can
harness humoral cellular arms immune system.
