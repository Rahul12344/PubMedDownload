the peritrophic matrix (pm) penetrated plasmodium ookinete permit
transition oocyst mosquito midgut, manner ookinete
interacts glycoproteins pm remains poorly understood. partially
characterized peritrophic matrix c-type lectin (pmctl) an. gambiae (ctl10)
and an. dirus (adpmctl). adpmctl protein produced specifically blood-fed
mosquitoes. 320 amino acid adpmctl exhibits 72% identity putative
secreted an. gambiae ortholog (agap009316, ctl10). adpmctl cloned its
expression profile determined sugar- blood-fed midguts. rnai used to
determine effect adpmctl blood meal size mosquito survival.
adpmctl mrna present midguts sugar-fed mosquitoes exhibited
up-regulation following blood meal, adpmctl silencing significantly
influenced blood-meal size engorged mosquitoes, suggesting role for
adpmctl stabilizing linker molecule, limits pm distension blood 
feeding.
