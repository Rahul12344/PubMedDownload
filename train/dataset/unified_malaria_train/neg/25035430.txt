the toll imd pathways known induced upon plasmodium berghei and
plasmodium falciparum infection, respectively. unclear plasmodium or
other pathogens blood meal invasion midgut epithelium
would trigger innate immune responses immune cells, particular
hemocytes. gap junctions, mediate cell-to-cell and
cell-to-extracellular communication, may participate signal transduction.
this study examined whether innexins, gap junction proteins insects, are
involved anti-plasmodium responses anopheles gambiae. inhibitor studies
using carbenoxolone indicated blocking innexons resulted increase in
plasmodium oocyst number infection prevalence. accompanied a
decline tep1 levels carbenoxolone-treated mosquitoes. innexin agap001476
mrna levels midguts induced plasmodium infection knockdown
of agap001476, agap006241, caused induction oocyst number.
silencing agap001476 caused concurrent increase vitellogenin levels, tep1 
inhibitor, addition reduced level tep1-lrim1-apl1c complex in
hemolymph. vitellogenin tep1 regulated cactus toll
pathway. simultaneous knockdown cactus agap001476 failed reverse the
near refractoriness induced knockdown cactus, suggesting the
agap001476-mediated anti-plasmodium response cactus-dependent. data
demonstrate critical role innexin agap001476 mediating innate immune
responses plasmodium toll pathway mosquitoes.
