malaria caused plasmodium falciparum major cause global infant
mortality, currently licensed vaccine provides protection
against infection disease. several p. falciparum vaccine targets have
undergone early testing, many candidates remain little data to
support development. plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 6
(pfmsp6) candidate particular interest member the
pfmsp3 multi-gene family, raising possibility vaccine-induced immune
responses could cross-react across multiple family members. however, few
immunoepidemiological studies pfmsp6 carried measure
domain-specific anti-pfmsp6 responses. study investigated anti-pfmsp6
responses p. falciparum-infected individuals peruvian amazon, using
two different pfmsp6 n-terminal allele antigens single c-terminal domain
antigen, compared responses pfmsp6 genotyping data and
anti-pfmsp3 response data previously generated same
samples. anti-pfmsp6 responses detected despite low transmission
setting, less frequent considerably lower intensity than
anti-pfmsp3 responses. positive correlation anti-pfmsp3 and
pfmsp6 responses, suggesting possibility pfmsp3 family antigens
could induce cross-reactive responses requires detailed investigation.
