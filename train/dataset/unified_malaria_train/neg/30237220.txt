gene expression malaria parasites mediated apicomplexan apetala2
(apiap2) transcription factor family. different apiap2s control gene expression
at distinct stages complex life cycle parasite, ensuring timely
expression stage-specific genes. apiap2s recognize short cis-regulatory
elements enriched upstream/promoter region target genes.
this should, principle, allow generation 'synthetic' promoters that
drive gene expression desired stages plasmodium life cycle. we
test concept combining cis-regulatory elements two genes expressed
successively within mosquito part life cycle. tailored 'synthetic'
promoters, named spooki 1.0 spooki 2.0, activate gene expression early and
late mosquito stages, shown expression fluorescent reporter. we
used promoters address specific functionality two related
adhesins exclusively expressed either early late mosquito 
stage. modifying expression profile adhesins absence their
counterpart able test complementary functions gliding and
invasion. discuss possible advantages drawbacks approach.this
