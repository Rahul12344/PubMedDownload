the emergence drug-resistant plasmodium vivax poses problems malaria
control elimination parts world, especially developing
countries individuals routinely exposed infection. aim of
this study determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in
dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps) dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) genes
associated sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) drug resistance among p. vivax
isolates collected palawan, philippines. genetic polymorphisms pvdhps and
pvdhfr analysed nested pcr. analysis specific codons
i13p33f57s58t61s117i173 associated pyrimethamine resistance pvdhfr
gene revealed samples (66/87, 75.9%) carried double mutation 
positions i13p33f57r58t61n117i173, 18.4% (16/87) isolates
carried wild-type haplotype (i13p33f57s58t61s117i173). pvdhps gene,
the codons involved sulfadoxine resistance s382a383k512a553v585 were
investigated. single mutation position s382g383k512a553v585 observed 
in 68.0% (68/100) samples, whereas wild-type haplotype found 26.0% 
(26/100) samples. pvdhps pvdhfr combination
s382a383k512a553v585/i13p33f57s58t61s117i173 (wild-type),
s382g383k512a553v585/i13p33f57r58t61n117i173, and
s382a383k512a553v585-i13p33f57r58t61n117i173 frequently observed
combination haplotypes three study sites. information molecular
markers associated antifolate drug-resistance could help better
understanding ofthe molecular epidemiology situation sp resistant p. vivax
malaria country. continuous surveillance genetic markers is
necessary monitor evolution sp resistance philippines.
