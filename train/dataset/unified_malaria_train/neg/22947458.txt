background: hbb, il4, il12, tnf, lta, ncr3 fcgr2a polymorphisms been
associated malaria resistance humans, whereas cytophilic immunoglobulin g
(igg) antibodies thought play critical role immune protection against
asexual blood stages parasite. furthermore, hbb, il4, tnf, fcgr2a have
been associated malaria resistance igg levels. suggests that
some malaria resistance genes influence levels igg subclass antibodies.
methods: study, effect hbb, il4, il12, tnf, lta, ncr3 fcgr2a
polymorphisms levels igg responses plasmodium falciparum
blood-stage extract investigated 220 individuals living burkina faso.
the pearson's correlation coefficient among igg subclasses determined. a
family-based approach used assess association polymorphisms with
anti-p. falciparum igg, igg1, igg2, igg3 igg4 levels.
results: applying multiple test correction, several polymorphisms were
associated igg subclass igg levels. association i)
haemoglobin c igg levels; ii) fcÎ³riia h/r131 igg2 igg3 levels; 
iii) tnf-863 igg3 levels; iv) tnf-857 igg levels; and, v) tnf1304 
igg3, igg4, igg levels.
conclusion: taken together, results support hypothesis some
polymorphisms affect malaria resistance effect acquired
immune response, pave way towards comprehension genetic
control individual's humoral response malaria.
