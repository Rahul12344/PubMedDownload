rhus javanica linn, traditional medicinal herb family anacardiaceae,
has used treatment liver diseases, cancer, parasitic infections,
malaria respiratory diseases china, korea asian countries for
centuries. present study, protective effects r. javanica ethanolic 
extract (rje) hydrogen peroxide (h2o2)-induced oxidative stress human chang
liver cells investigated. cell cytotoxicity viability assessed
using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay.
the activities superoxide dismutase (sod) catalase (cat) measured
using respective enzymatic kits. cell cycle analysis performed using flow
cytometric analysis. protein expression levels p53, b-cell lymphoma
(bcl)-2, bcl-2-associated x protein (bax) caspase-3 assessed western 
blotting. human chang liver cells treated different concentrations
(0.1, 0.3 0.5 mg/ml) rje, subsequently exposed h2o2 (30 µm).
treatment h2o2 (30 µm) significantly induced cytotoxicity (p<0.05) and
reduced viability chang liver cells. however, pretreatment the
cells rje (0.1, 0.3 0.5 mg/ml) significantly increased cell viability
(p<0.001 0.5 mg/ml) concentration-dependent manner following h2o2
treatment. furthermore, pretreatment rje increased enzyme activities 
sod cat, decreased sub-g1 growth phase cell cycle response 
to h2o2-induced oxidative stress (p<0.001 0.3 0.5 mg/ml h2o2). rje also
regulated protein expression levels p53, bax, caspase-3 bcl-2. these
results suggested rje may protect human chang liver cells oxidative 
damage increasing levels antioxidant enzymes regulating
antiapoptotic oxidative stress mechanisms, thereby providing insights the
mechanism underpins traditional claims made rje treatment of
liver diseases.
