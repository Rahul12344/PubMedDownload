background: myanmar, civil unrest establishment internally
displaced person (idp) settlements along myanmar-china border impacted
malaria transmission.
methods: microsatellite markers used examine source-sink dynamics for
plasmodium vivax idp settlements surrounding villages border
region. genotypic structure diversity compared across 3 years
following establishment idp settlements, infer demographic history. 
investigated whether human migration landscape heterogeneity contributed to
p. vivax transmission.
results: p. vivax idp settlements local communities consistently
exhibited high genetic diversity within populations low polyclonality within 
individuals. apparent genetic structure observed among populations and
years. p. vivax genotypes china similar myanmar, parasite
introduction unidirectional. landscape factors, including distance,
elevation, land cover, appear impede parasite gene flow.
conclusions: admixture p. vivax genotypes suggested parasite gene
flow via human movement contributes spread malaria locally in
myanmar across international border. genetic findings highlight the
presence large p. vivax gene reservoirs sustain transmission. thus,
it important reinforce improve existing control efforts along border
areas.
