malaria hiv infection coendemic large portion world and
remain major cause morbidity mortality. growing resistance plasmodium
species existing therapies increased need new therapeutic
approaches. plasmodium glucose transporter pfht known essential 
parasite growth survival. previously shown hiv protease
inhibitors (pis) act antagonists mammalian glucose transporters. 
pi lopinavir known antimalarial activity, mechanism action is
unknown. report lopinavir blocks glucose uptake isolated
malaria parasites therapeutically relevant drug levels. malaria parasites
depend constant supply glucose primary source energy, and
decreasing available concentration glucose leads parasite death. we
identified malarial glucose transporter pfht target inhibition by
lopinavir leads parasite death. discovery provides mechanistic
basis antimalarial effect lopinavir provides direct target for
novel drug design utility beyond hiv-infected population.
