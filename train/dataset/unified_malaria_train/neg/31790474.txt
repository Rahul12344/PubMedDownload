the understanding factors affecting gut bacterial communities malaria
vectors essential design vector control interventions, as
those based paratransgenic approach. one requirements method 
is availability bacteria mosquito susceptible culture. thus,
the aim study evaluate composition structure the
culturable gut bacterial communities field mosquitoes anopheles albimanus from
colombia, addition generate bacterial collection analyze
microbial functional activity. gut bacteria isolated an. albimanus
larvae adult mosquitoes collected localities atlantic pacific
coasts. bacterial isolates grouped 28 morphospecies corresponded
to three phyla, three classes, nine families 14 genera. larvae guts 
san antero (atlantic coast) buenaventura (pacific coast) shared genera
bacillus lysinibacillus adults, bacillus bacillus cereus group
were registered localities. gut bacterial richness higher adults
from pacific respect atlantic coast, larval richness was
similar samples coasts. shannon index indicated uniformity in
morphospecies abundances localities. finally, characterization of
morphospecies gut anopheles albimanus mosquitoes colombia by
culture-dependent methods complemented 16s rrna gene sequencing allowed 
definition, finer resolution, composition structure these
microbial communities. addition, obtained bacterial culture collection
will allow evaluation microorganisms potential as
biocontrol agents.
