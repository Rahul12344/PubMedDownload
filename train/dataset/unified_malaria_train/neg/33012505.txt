hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) prevalent type liver cancer. in
this study, aimed explore role mechanism lncrna st8sia6-as1 in
hcc. found st8sia6-as1 upregulated hcc tissues associated with
poorer overall survival hcc patients tcga. moreover, st8sia6-as1 was
highly expressed hcc in-house tissues cells, st8sia6-as1 upregulation 
was related aggressive tumor phenotypes poor overall survival hcc
patients. downregulation st8sia6-as1 suppressed hcc cell proliferation,
migration invasion in vitro restrained hcc tumorigenesis in vivo. in
terms mechanism, st8sia6-as1 regulated melanoma-associated antigen (mage)-a3
(magea3) ddb1-and cul4-associated factor 4-like 2 (dcaf4l2) expression, and
rescue experiments verified st8sia6-as1 played protumorigenic role hcc 
via regulation magea3 dcaf4l2. st8sia6-as1 partly directly bound to
mir-129-5p functioned competing endogenous rna (cerna), subsequently
facilitating expression mir-129-5p target gene dcaf4l2 play its
role hcc. summary, results identified st8sia6-as1 oncogenic
lncrna predicting poor clinical outcomes patients hcc. findings
suggest st8sia6-as1 potential therapeutic target hcc.
