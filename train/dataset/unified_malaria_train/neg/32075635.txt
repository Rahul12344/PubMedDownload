background: according world health organization reports, billions of
people around world risk malaria disease important to
consider preventive strategies protecting people living in
high risk areas. one main reasons disease survival diversity of
vectors parasites different malaria regions specific
features, behaviour biology. therefore, specific regional strategies are
necessary successful control malaria. one tools needs be
developed elimination prevention reintroduction malaria a
vaccine interrupt malaria transmission (vimts). vimt broad concept that
should adjusted biological characteristics disease each
region. one type vimt vector-based vaccine affects sexual stage 
of plasmodium life cycle. according recent studies, aminopeptidase n-1 
anopheles gambiae (agapn-1) potent vector-based vimt considerable
inhibition activity sexual stage plasmodium parasite.
methods: systems rapid amplification cdna ends (3'-race) genome
walking methods used sequence determination apn-1 gene anopheles
stephensi distinct bioinformatics software used structural analysis.
asapn-1 expressed spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) insect cell line using the
baculovirus expression system. recombinant asapn-1 purified hybrid 
condition biological activity assayed.
results: asapn-1 gene coded protein an. stephensi characterized
for first time study. subsequently, structural features and
immunological properties coded protein evaluated silico
approaches. enzymatic activity recombinant asapn-1, expressed in
sf9 insect cell line, equal 6 unit/μl.
conclusions: results study revealed asapn-1 similar its
counterpart an. gambiae. silico evaluation fundamental data are
necessary evaluation vimt-based vaccine next steps were
acquired study could useful research groups study
on malaria vaccine countries an. stephensi main malaria vector
there.
