the ribosomal rna adenine dimethyltransferases (rad) ksga/dim1 family are
universally conserved eukaryotic rads separated distinct cytosolic dim1
and organellar ksga/tfb homologs. among two putative ksga proteins encoded by
the plasmodium falciparum genome, found pfksga1 dually localised in
the cytoplasm mitochondrion. protein interacted specifically with
small ribosomal subunit detected ribosome pull-down using anti-pfksga1
antibodies. recombinant pfksga1 exhibited methyltransferase activity was
further confirmed complementation escherichia coli ksga knockout strain.
similar human mitochondrial ksga homologs additionally function
as transcription regulators, pfksga1 also interacted dna sequence
non-specific manner suggesting one functional role important
ribosome biogenesis protein plasmodium.
