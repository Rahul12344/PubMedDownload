antimalarial chemotherapy one main pillars prevention and
control malaria. following widespread resistance plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine came scene alternative the
cheap well-tolerated chloroquine. however, widespread resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine documented. vivo efficacy tests the
gold standard assessing drug resistance treatment failure. however, 
have many disadvantages, influence host immunity drug
pharmacokinetics. vitro tests antimalarial drug efficacy also many
technical difficulties. molecular markers resistance emerged as
epidemiologic tools investigate antimalarial drug resistance even before
becoming clinically evident. mutations p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
and dihydrofolate synthase extensively studied molecular markers for
resistance pyrimethamine sulfadoxine, respectively. review highlights
the resistance p. falciparum molecular level presenting supporting
and opposing studies utility molecular markers.
