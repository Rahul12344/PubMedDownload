plasmodium vivax major cause malaria morbidity worldwide yet remained
genetically intractable. stably modify organism, used zinc-finger
nucleases (zfns), take advantage homology-directed dna repair mechanisms
at site nuclease action. using zfns specific gene encoding p. vivax
dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr), transfected blood specimens saimiri
boliviensis monkeys infected pyrimethamine (pyr)-susceptible chesson
strain zfn plasmid carrying pyr-resistant mutant pvdhfr sequence. we
obtained pyr-resistant parasites vivo carried mutant pvdhfr and
additional silent mutations designed confirm editing. results herald the
era stable p. vivax genetic modifications.
