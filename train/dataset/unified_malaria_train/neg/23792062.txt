the aim paper review use genetics palaeomicrobiology, and
to highlight importance understanding past diseases. palaeomicrobiology is
the study disease pathogens skeletal mummified remains from
archaeological contexts. revolutionarised understanding health in
the past enabling deeper knowledge origins evolution many
diseases shaped us species. bacterial diseases explored include
tuberculosis, leprosy, bubonic plague, typhoid, syphilis, endemic epidemic
typhus, trench fever, helicobacter pylori. viral diseases discussed include
influenza, hepatitis b, human papilloma virus (hpv), human t-cell lymphotrophic
virus (htlv-1) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). parasitic diseases
investigated include malaria, leishmaniasis, chagas' disease, roundworm,
whipworm, pinworm, chinese liver fluke, fleas lice. better
understanding disease origins evolution, place context
how many infectious diseases changing time, help us estimate 
they may change future.
