in cross-sectional study, investigated host genetic factors ethnic
variation circulating plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2
(msp-2) clones among children asymptomatic malaria. isolates seventy
two asymptomatic malaria children used genotyping block 3 msp-2 gene 
by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). sickle cell trait and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency analysed restriction 
fragment length polymorphism dna products pcr targeting codons 6 68
of beta-globin (hbb) g6pd genes respectively. abo blood group typed
by agglutination method. total forty two msp-2 genotypes (20 3d7 22 
for fc27) detected average (standard error mean) multiplicity of
infection (moi) 2.45 (0.16). moi statistically among five
identified ethnic groups (p = 0.83). overall prevalence sickle cell trait 
and g6pd deficiency 12.50 % 22.22 % respectively. moi similar
between children hb aa hb genotypes (p = 0.42). moi significantly
high among children mutant g6pd genotype (p = 0.017). moi was
significantly higher blood group group (p = 0.03). findings show 
that although ethnicity sickle cell trait association moi, the
association observed g6pd genotype abo group. results suggest
the need extension expansion current study order investigate
the mechanisms involved.
