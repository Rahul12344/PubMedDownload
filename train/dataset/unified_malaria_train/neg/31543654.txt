background: malaria placed huge burden human life reported to
be key health problem affecting developing countries. study designed
to assay glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) status malaria parasite
density individuals sickle cell gene university calabar teaching
hospital, calabar.
subjects methods: methemoglobin method used determine g6pd
status. thick blood films used ascertain malaria parasite density
while hemoglobin genotype determined using cellulose acetate paper
electrophoresis tris ethylenediaminetetracetic acid borate buffer (ph 8.6). 
thirty hemoglobin ss (hbss) 30 hemoglobin (hbas) individuals were
recruited study 30 hemoglobin aa (hbaa) individuals recruited 
as control.
results: study showed high frequency g6pd deficiency (17.78%) the
study area g6pd deficiency significantly (p < 0.05) higher hbaa
individuals (33.33%) compared hbss (10.00%) hbas (10.00%)
individuals. prevalence malaria parasitemia parasite density was
comparable three hemoglobin variants. distribution malaria
parasitemia parasite density gender among various hemoglobin
variants showed association (p > 0.05). g6pd deficiency distribution both
gender found comparable (p > 0.05). distribution malaria
parasitemia various hemoglobin variants g6pd-deficient individuals 
showed significant difference (p > 0.5). however, parasite density 
hbas (3100 ± 1828.48 μl) hbss (2400 ± 1687.06 μl) significantly lower
than hbaa (4040 ± 1529.44 μl).
conclusion: result study supports hypothesis inheriting 
g6pd deficiency gene sickle cell gene (both homozygous heterozygous
form) reduces severity malaria parasite infection hence protects
against severe acute malaria less effect infection.
