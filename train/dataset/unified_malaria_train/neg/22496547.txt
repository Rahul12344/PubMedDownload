pfemp1 family cytoadhesive surface antigens expressed erythrocytes
infected plasmodium falciparum, parasite causes severe
form malaria. surface antigens play role immune evasion are
thought contribute pathogenesis malaria parasite. previous
studies suggested role specific subset pfemp1 called "group a" in
severe malaria. explore role group pfemp1 disease, measured the
expression var genes encode parasites clinical isolates 
collected children suffering malaria. also looked ability 
these clinical isolates induce rosetting erythrocytes, indicates a
cytoadhesion phenotype thought important pathogenesis. two
sets data correlated presence two life-threatening
manifestations severe malaria children: impaired consciousness and
respiratory distress. using regression analysis, show marked rosetting
was associated respiratory distress, whereas elevated expression group
a-like var genes without elevated rosetting associated impaired
consciousness. results suggest manifestations malarial disease may
reflect distribution cytoadhesion phenotypes expressed infecting
parasite population.
