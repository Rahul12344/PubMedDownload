considerable technological advances made towards generation of
genetically modified mosquitoes vector control. contrast, less progress
has made towards field evaluations transformed mosquitoes are
critical evaluating success of, hazards associated with, genetic
modification. oceanic islands highlighted potentially best
locations trials. however, population genetic studies necessary to
verify isolation. here, used panel genetic markers assess evidence
of genetic isolation two oceanic island populations african malaria
vector, anopheles gambiae s.s. found evidence isolation the
bijag√≥s archipelago mainland guinea-bissau, despite separation distances
beyond known dispersal capabilities taxon. conversely, comoros
islands appear genetically isolated east african mainland, and
thus represent location worthy investigation field trials. based
on assessments gene flow within comoros islands, island of
grande comore found genetically isolated adjacent islands also
exhibited local population structure, indicating may suitable
site trials existing genetic modification technologies.
