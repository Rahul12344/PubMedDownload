background: plasmodium, meiosis occurs diploid zygotes develop into
haploid motile ookinetes inside mosquito. sporogonic development
involves transformation ookinetes oocysts formation infective
sporozoites.
methodology/principal findings: reverse genetics employed examine role
of meiotic specific recombinase dmc1, bacterial reca homolog during
sporogony plasmodium berghei. pbdmc1 knockout (ko) parasites showed normal
asexual growth kinetics compared wt parasites; however oocyst formation in
mosquitoes reduced 50 80%. moreover, majority oocysts were
retarded growth smaller size compared wt parasites. 
a dmc1 ko parasites completed maturation resulting formation fewer
sporozoites incapable infecting naive mice hepatocytes vitro.
pbdmc1 ko parasites shown approximately 18 times sensitive to
bizelesin, dna alkylating drug compared wt parasites reflected by
impairment oocyst formation sporogonic development mosquito vector.
conclusions/significance: findings suggest pbdmc1 plays critical role 
in malaria transmission biology.
