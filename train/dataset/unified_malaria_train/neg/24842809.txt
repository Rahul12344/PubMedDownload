elizabethkingia anophelis dominant bacterial species gut ecosystem of
the malaria vector mosquito anopheles gambiae. recently sequenced genomes 
of two strains e. anophelis, r26t ag1, isolated different strains 
a. gambiae. two bacterial strains identical exceptions.
phylogenetically, elizabethkingia closer chryseobacterium riemerella
than flavobacterium. line bacteroidetes known utilize various
polymers ecological niches, e. anophelis genome contains numerous
tonb dependent transporters various substrate specificities. addition,
several genes belonging polysaccharide utilization system the
glycoside hydrolase family identified could potentially benefit
for mosquito carbohydrate metabolism. agreement previous reports of
broad antibiotic resistance e. anophelis, large number genes encoding
efflux pumps Î²-lactamases present genome. component genes of
resistance-nodulation-division type efflux pumps found syntenic and
conserved different taxa bacteroidetes. bacterium also displays
hemolytic activity encodes several hemolysins may participate the
digestion erythrocytes mosquito gut. time, oxyr regulon
and antioxidant genes could provide defense oxidative stress 
associated blood digestion. genome annotation comparative genomic
analysis revealed functional characteristics associated symbiotic
relationship mosquito host.
