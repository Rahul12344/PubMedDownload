plasmodium falciparum origin recognition complex 1 (orc1) protein been
implicated dna replication silencing var gene family. however, the
mechanism domain structure orc1 related regulation var gene 
family unknown. show unique n-terminus pforc1
(pforc1n(1-238)) targeted nuclear periphery vivo region
binds telomeric dna vitro due presence leucine heptad
repeats. like pforc1n(1-238), endogenous full length orc1, found be
associated sub telomeric repeat regions promoters various var genes. 
additionally, binding propagation orc1 telomeric subtelomeric
regions severely compromised pfsir2 deficient parasites suggesting the
dependence endogenous orc1 sir2 var gene regulation. feature is
not previously described plasmodium orc1 contrary yeast saccharomyces 
cerevisiae orc function landing pad sir proteins. interestingly,
the overexpression orc1n(1-238) compromises binding sir2 the
subtelomeric loci var gene promoters consistent de-repression some
var genes. results establish role n-terminus pforc1 in
heterochromatin formation regulation var gene expression co-ordination 
with sir2 p. falciparum.
