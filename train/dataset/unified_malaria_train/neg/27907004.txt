plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) considered be
the main variant surface antigen (vsa) plasmodium falciparum mainly
localized electron-dense knobs membrane infected erythrocyte.
switches pfemp1 expression provide basis antigenic variation are
thought critical parasite persistence chronic infections.
recently, strain transcending anti-pfemp1 immunity shown develop
early life, challenging role pfemp1 antigenic variation during
chronic infections. work investigate p. falciparum achieves
persistence chronic asymptomatic infection. infected individual
(moa) parasitemic 42 days multilocus var gene genotyping showed
persistence parasite population throughout infection. parasites
from beginning infection adapted tissue culture cloned 
limiting dilution. flow cytometry using convalescent serum detected variable
surface recognition signal isogenic clonal parasites. quantitative real-time
pcr field isolate specific var gene primer set showed surface
recognition signal correlated transcription individual var genes.
strain transcending anti-pfemp1 immunity convalescent serum was
demonstrated cd36 selected pfemp1 knock-down nf54 clones. contrast,
knock-down pfemp1 effect antibody recognition signal in
moa clones. trypsinisation membrane surface proteins abolished surface
recognition signal immune electron microscopy revealed antibodies from
the convalescent serum bound membrane areas without knobs knobs.
together data indicate pfemp1 main variable surface antigen
during chronic infection suggest role trypsin sensitive non-pfemp1
vsas parasite persistence chronic infections.
