objectives: invasive disease caused neisseria meningitidis significant
health concern globally, knowledge prevailing serogroups,
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, genetics n. meningitidis in
southeast asia limited. chloramphenicol resistance n. meningitidis has
rarely reported, first described isolates vietnam 1998.
we aimed characterise eight chloramphenicol resistant meningococcal isolates
collected 2007 2018 diagnostic microbiology laboratories in
cambodia, thailand lao people's democratic republic (laos).
methods: whole-genome sequencing used generate genome sequences 18
meningococcal isolates including eight chloramphenicol resistant isolates. we
identified antimicrobial resistance genes present strains, examined 
the phylogenetic relationships strains.
results: eight resistant strains contain chloramphenicol
resistance gene first described 1998, closely related other.
strains resistant penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin also
observed, including chloramphenicol-resistant strain acquired
penicillin ciprofloxacin resistance.
conclusions: study suggests chloramphenicol-resistant n. meningitidis
is widespread previously thought, previously-identified
resistant lineage found multiple countries southeast asia.
