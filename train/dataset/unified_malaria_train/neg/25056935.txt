one critical gaps malaria transmission biology surveillance 
lack knowledge plasmodium falciparum gametocyte biology, especially
sexual dimorphic development sex ratios may influence transmission
from human mosquito. dissecting process hampered 
lack sex-specific protein markers circulating, mature stage v
gametocytes. current evidence suggests high degree conservation in
gametocyte gene complement across plasmodium, therefore presumably for
sex-specific genes well. better understanding gametocyte development
and subsequent infectiousness mosquitoes, undertook systematic
subtractive bioinformatic analysis (filtering) approach identify sex-specific 
p. falciparum nf54 protein markers based comparison dd2 strain,
which defective producing males, syntenic male female proteins
from reanalyzed updated p. berghei (related rodent malaria parasite)
gametocyte proteomes. produced short list 174 male- 258
female-enriched p. falciparum stage v proteins, appear 
strong diversifying selection, suggesting ongoing adaptation mosquito vector
species. generated antibodies three putative female-specific
gametocyte stage v proteins p. falciparum confirmed either conserved
sex-specificity lack cross-species sex-partitioning. finally, study
provides additional resource mass spectrometry-derived evidence
for gametocyte proteins also lays foundation rational screening 
and development novel sex-partitioned protein biomarkers and
transmission-blocking vaccine candidates.
