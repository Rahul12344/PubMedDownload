early plasmablast induction hallmark plasmodium infection thought 
to contribute control acute parasite burden. although long understood
to t-cell dependent phenomenon, regulation early plasmablast
differentiation, however, poorly understood. here, identify population of
cd4+ cells express innate nk cell marker nk1.1 important source 
of cell help early plasmablast parasite-specific ab production.
interestingly, nk1.1+ cd4+ cells arise conventional, naive nk1.1- cd4+ t
cells, generation independent cd1d critically reliant on
mhc-ii. cd4+ cells express nk1.1 early activation produce ifn-Î³ 
il-21, express follicular helper (tfh) cell markers icos, pd-1 and
cxcr5 frequently nk1.1- cd4+ cells. analysis this
population revealed nk1.1+ tfh-like cells regularly complexed with
plasmablasts nk1.1- tfh-like cells. ultimately, depletion nk1.1+ cells
impaired class-switched parasite-specific antibody production early
plasmodium yoelii infection. together, data suggest expression of
nk1.1 defines population rapidly expanding effector cd4+ cells that
specifically promote plasmablast induction plasmodium infection and
represent subset cells whose modulation could promote effective vaccine
design.
