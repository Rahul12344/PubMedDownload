background: emergence resistance artemisinin combination treatment
is major concern malaria control. acts recommended rescue
treatment, however, limited evidence whether treatment and
re-treatment acts select drug-resistant p. falciparum parasites. thus,
the purpose present study investigate impact (re-)treatment
using artesunate-amodiaquine (asaq) artemether-lumefantrine (al) the
selection p. falciparum multidrug resistance-1 (pfmdr1) alleles clinical
settings.
methods: p. falciparum positive samples collected children aged 12-59
months clinical trial dr congo uganda. pfmdr1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) analysis codons n86y, y184f, d1246y performed at
baseline post-treatment either al asaq rescue treatment using
nested pcr followed restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) assays.
results: pre-treatment prevalence pfmdr1 n86 d1246y varied
significantly sites, (p>0.001) (p = 0.013), respectively. there
was borderline significant directional selection pfmdr1 184f recurrent
malaria infections treatment al uganda site (p = 0.05). pfmdr1 nfd 
haplotype significantly change post-treatment infections after
re-treatment either al asaq. comparison pre-treatment and
post-treatment recurrences indicate directional selection pfmdr1 n86, 
d1246 alleles pre-rct, rct post-rct phases al asaq
treatment arms. pfmdr1 86y significantly associated reduced risk al
treatment failure (rr = 0.34, 95% ci:0.11-1.05, p = 0.04) evidence for
d1246 allele (rr = 1.02; 95% ci: 0.42-2.47, p = 1.0). survival estimates showed
that pfmdr1 alleles comparable mean-time pcr-corrected recrudescence
and new infections al asaq treatment arms.
conclusion: found limited impact (re-)treatment al asaq on
selection pfmdr1 variants haplotypes associated resistance to
partner drugs. findings supplement evidence use or
alternative acts rescue therapy recurrent p.falciparum infections.
continued monitoring genetic signatures resistance warranted timely
inform malaria (re-)treatment policies guidelines.
