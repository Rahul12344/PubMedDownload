despite intense efforts safe efficacious vaccine visceral
leishmaniasis, fatal endemic many tropical countries. major
shortcoming vaccine development blood-borne parasitic agents 
as leishmania inadequate predictive power early immune responses
mounted host experimental vaccines. often immune correlates
derived in-bred animal models yield immune markers protection that
can readily extrapolated humans. limited efficacy vaccines based 
dna, subunit, heat killed parasites led realization acquisition
of durable immunity protozoan parasites requires controlled
infection live attenuated organism. recent success irradiated malaria
parasites vaccine candidate strengthens approach to
vaccination. developed several gene deletion mutants leishmania donovani as
potential live attenuated vaccines reported extensively immunogenicity
of ldcentrin1 deleted mutant mice, hamsters, dogs. additional limited
studies using genetically modified live attenuated leishmania parasites as
vaccine candidates reported. however, live attenuated parasite 
vaccines, primary barrier widespread use remains absence clear
biomarkers associated protection safety. recent studies evaluation of
vaccines, e.g., influenza yellow fever vaccines, using systems biology tools 
demonstrated power strategies understanding immunological
mechanisms underpin protective phenotype. applying similar tools in
isolated human tissues pbmcs healthy individuals infected live 
attenuated parasites ldcen(-/-) vitro followed human microarray
hybridization experiments enable us understand early vaccine-induced 
gene expression profiles associated immune responses coordinately
regulated normal individuals. addition, comparative analysis biomarkers 
in pbmcs asymptomatic healed visceral leishmaniasis individuals in
response vaccine candidates including live attenuated parasites may provide
clues determinants protective immunity helpful shaping the
final leishmania vaccine formulation clinical trials.
