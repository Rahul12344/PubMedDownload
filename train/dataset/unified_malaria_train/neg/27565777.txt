artemisia annua l. mostly known bioactive metabolite, artemisinin, an
effective sesquiterpene lactone used malaria without reputed cases of
resistance. experiment, bioinoculants viz., streptomyces sp. mtn14,
bacillus megaterium mtn2rp trichoderma harzianum thu applied growth
promoting substances exploit full genetic potential crops terms of
growth, yield, nutrient uptake particularly artemisinin content. further,
multi-use bioinoculants singly combinations enhancement 
antioxidant potential therapeutic value also undertaken our
knowledge never investigated context microbial application. 
results demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) increase growth, nutrient
uptake, total phenolic, flavonoid, free radical scavenging activity, ferric
reducing antioxidant power, reducing power total antioxidant capacity were
observed a. annua treated combination bioinoculants in
comparison control. importantly, increase artemisinin content and
yield 34 72 % respectively treatment three microbes 
was observed. results authenticated pca analysis 
showed positive correlation plant macronutrients antioxidant content 
with plant growth artemisinin yield a. annua. present study thus
highlights possible new application compatible bioinoculants enhancing
the growth along antioxidant therapeutic value a. annua.
