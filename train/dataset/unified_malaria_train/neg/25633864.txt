the genome malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum extremely rich.
this bias toward low gc content characteristic several, all,
species within genus plasmodium. compared 4283 orthologous pairs of
protein-coding sequences plasmodium falciparum less at-biased
plasmodium vivax. results indicate common ancestor two
species also extremely rich. means that, although strong 
bias toward a+t early evolution ancestral plasmodium lineage,
there subsequent reversal trend recent evolution of
some species, p. vivax. moreover, show p. vivax
genome losing richness, actually gaining significant degree
of gc richness. example illustrates potential volatility nucleotide
content course molecular evolution. reversible fluxes in
nucleotide content within lineages could important implications for
phylogenetic reconstruction based molecular sequence data.
