background: many parasites use multicopy protein families avoid host's
immune system strategy called antigenic variation. rifin stevor
proteins variable surface antigens uniquely found malaria parasites
plasmodium falciparum p. reichenowi. although two protein families 
different, similarity proteins
described date. result, grouped together one pfam
domain. however, recent study described sub-division rifin
protein family several functionally distinct groups. sub-groups
require phylogenetic analysis sort out, practical large-scale
projects, sequencing patient isolates meta-genomic analysis.
results: manually curated rif stevor gene repertoires two
plasmodium falciparum genomes, isolates dd2 hb3. identified 25% of
mis-annotated ~30 missing rif stevor genes. using data sets, as
well sequences well curated reference genome (isolate 3d7) field 
isolate data uniprot, developed tool named rspred. tool, based
on set hidden markov models evaluation program, automatically
identifies stevor rifin sequences well sub-groups: a-rifin,
b-rifin, b1-rifin b2-rifin. addition groups, distinguish a
small subset stevor proteins named stevor-like, either differ 
remarkably typical stevor proteins fragmented reach high
enough score. compared pfam tigrfams, rspred proves more
robust sensitive method. applied rspred proteomes of
several p. falciparum strains, p. reichenowi, p. vivax, p. knowlesi the
rodent malaria species. groups found p. falciparum strains, and
also p. reichenowi parasite, whereas none predicted other
species.
conclusions: generated tool sorting rifin stevor
proteins, large antigenic variant protein groups, homogeneous sub-families. 
assigning functions protein families requires subdivision into
meaningful groups shown rifin protein family. rspred
removes need complicated time consuming phylogenetic analysis
methods. benefit research groups sequencing whole genomes well as
others working field isolates. rspred freely accessible via
