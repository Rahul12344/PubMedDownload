blood stage malaria vaccines. present study, identified and
characterized microneme associated antigen, pfma [plasmodb gene id:
pf3d7_0316000, pfc0700c]. gene selected applying set screening
criteria transcriptional upregulation late schizogony, inter-species
conservation presence signal sequence transmembrane domains. the
gene sequence pfma found conserved amongst various plasmodium
species. experimentally demonstrated transcript pfma was
expressed late blood stages parasite consistent putative
role erythrocyte invasion. pfma localized immunofluorescence and
immuno-electron microscopy micronemes, apical organelle of
merozoites. functional role pfma protein erythrocyte invasion was
identified parasite adhesin involved direct attachment target
erythrocyte. pfma demonstrated bind erythrocytes sialic acid
independent, chymotrypsin trypsin resistant manner antibodies
inhibited p. falciparum erythrocyte invasion. invasion erythrocytes a
complex multistep process involves number redundant ligand-receptor
interactions many still remain unknown even uncharacterized. our
work identified characterized novel p. falciparum adhesin involved in
erythrocyte invasion.
