malaria disease public health problem especially tropical countries,
445.000 malaria-related deaths reported 2017. micrornas (mirnas) 
are small non-coding rnas 18-24 nucleotides length, been
demonstrated regulate gene expression several biological processes. the
dysregulation host immune-related gene expressions transcriptional 
process microrna extensively reported malaria parasite invasion of
erythrocytes infection. candidate's mirnas would used potential
biomarkers future perspective. systematic review mirnas as
candidate clinical biomarkers malaria infection established this
study. electronic databases (medline, embase, cinahl cochrane data bases)
were screened articles included per established selection criteria.
we comprehensively searched identify publications related malaria and
mirna. prisma guidelines followed, 262 articles searched, duplicates
and unconnected papers excluded. nineteen articles included the
study. found malaria parasite infected liver tissue produce
tissue-specific mirnas release blood stream. association mirnas
including mir-16, mir-155, mir-150, mir-451 mir-223 dysregulations
of immune-related genes expression pfemp-1, ifn-γ, ago- 1 ago-2; il4,
cd80, cd86, cd36, ang-1 ang-2 early, severe and/or cerebral malaria
infections indicate potential use mirnas biomarkers malaria
infection.
