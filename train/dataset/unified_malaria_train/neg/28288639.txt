background: non-human primates, rhesus macaques, preferred
model down-selecting human malaria vaccine formulations, rhesus model
is expensive allow direct efficacy testing human malaria
vaccines. transgenic rodent parasites expressing genes human plasmodium are
now routinely used efficacy studies human malaria vaccines. mice have
however rarely predicted success human malaria trials scepticism 
whether mouse studies alone sufficient move vaccine candidate the
clinic.
methods: comparison immunogenicity, fine-specificity functional activity
of two alum-adjuvanted plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (csp)-based
vaccines conducted mouse rhesus models. one vaccine soluble
recombinant protein (csp) csp covalently conjugated to
the qβ phage particle (qβ-csp).
results: mice showed different kinetics antibody responses different
sensitivity nanp-repeat n-terminal epitopes compared rhesus.
while mice failed discern differences protective efficacy csp
versus qβ-csp vaccine following direct challenge transgenic plasmodium
berghei parasites, rhesus serum qβ-csp-vaccinated animals induced higher
in vivo sporozoite neutralization activity.
conclusions: despite immunologic parallels models, data
demonstrate differences immune responses induced two
models risk conflicting decisions regarding potential vaccine utility humans. 
in combination historical observations, data presented suggest that
although murine models may useful purposes, non-human primate models 
may likely predict human response investigational vaccines.
