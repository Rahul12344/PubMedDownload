plasmodium malariae causes malaria humans throughout tropics and
subtropics. plasmodium ovale curtisi plasmodium ovale wallikeri sympatric
sibling species common sub-saharan africa also found oceania asia. 
although rarely identified cause malaria cases endemic countries,
pcr detection confirmed three parasite species prevalent, 
persistent, previously thought. chronic, low-density, multispecies
asymptomatic infection successful biological adaptation plasmodium 
spp., pattern also observed among malaria parasites wild primates. current
whole-genome analyses illuminating species barrier separating ovale
parasite species reveal substantial expansion subtelomeric gene families.
