background: extracellular vesicles (evs) broadly studied malaria for
nearly decade. vesicles carry various functional biomolecules including
rna families micrornas (mirna). evs-derived micrornas numerous
roles host-parasite interactions considered promising biomarkers for
disease severity. however, field lacks clinical studies malaria-infected 
samples. study, ev specific mirnas isolated plasma of
patients thailand infected plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum. 
in addition, postulated mirnas differentially expressed 
these groups patients role disease onset regulation
of specific target genes.
methods: evs purified plasma thai p. vivax-infected patients
(n = 19), p. falciparum-infected patients (n = 18) uninfected individuals
(n = 20). ev-derived mirnas prepared abundance hsa-mir-15b-5p,
hsa-mir-16-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p hsa-mir-150-5p assessed samples.
quantitative polymerase chain reaction performed, relative expression 
each mirna calculated using hsa-mir-451a endogenous control. then, the
targets up-regulated mirnas relevant pathways predicted using
bioinformatics. receiver operating characteristic area curve (auc)
was calculated assess diagnostic potential.
results: relative expression hsa-mir-150-5p hsa-mir-15b-5p higher 
in p. vivax-infected patients compared uninfected individuals, but
hsa-let-7a-5p up-regulated p. vivax-infected patients p.
falciparum-infected patients. bioinformatic analysis revealed mirnas
might regulate genes involved malaria pathway including adherens
junction transforming growth factor-β pathways. up-regulated mirnas
could potentially used disease biomarkers determined auc; however,
the sensitivity specificity require investigation.
conclusion: upregulation hsa-mir-150-5p hsa-mir-15b-5p observed 
p. vivax-infected patients hsa-let-7a-5p up-regulated p.
vivax-infected p. falciparum-infected patients. findings require
further validation larger cohort groups malaria patients fully
understand contribution evs mirnas malaria detection biology.
