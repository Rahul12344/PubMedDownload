single-cell rna-sequencing revolutionising understanding seemingly
homogeneous cell populations yet widely applied single-celled
organisms. transcriptional variation unicellular malaria parasites the
plasmodium genus associated critical phenotypes including red blood cell 
invasion immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation individual
