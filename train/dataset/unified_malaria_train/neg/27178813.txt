tumour necrosis factor (tnf) - α shown play important role 
pathogenesis falciparum malaria. two tnf promoter polymorphisms, tnf-308 and
tnf-238 associated differential activity production tnf. in
order investigate association tnf-308 tnf-238 clinical
outcome malaria nigerian population, two tnf polymorphisms were
analysed using sequenom iplex platform. total 782 children; 283 children
with uncomplicated malaria, 255 children severe malaria 244 children
with asymptomatic infection (controls) studied. distribution tnf-308 
and tnf-238 genotypes consistent hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
distribution tnf polymorphisms differed significantly across clinical
groups (tnf-308: p=0.007; tnf-238: p=0.001). tests association with
severe malaria using genotype models controlling age, parasitaemia hbas
showed significant association tnf-238 polymorphism susceptibility 
to severe malaria (95% ci=1.43-6.02, or=2.94, p=0.003237) gg genotype of
tnf-238 significantly increased risk developing cerebral malaria from
asymptomatic malaria uncomplicated malaria (95% ci=1.99-18.17, or=6.02,
p<0.001 95% ci=1.78-8.23, or=3.84, p<0.001 respectively). significant
association found tnf-308 malaria outcome. results show
thegenetic association tnf-238 clinical outcome malaria ibadan,
southwest nigeria. findings add support role tnf outcome
of malaria infection. large scale studies across multiple malaria endemic
populations required determine specific roles tnf-308 and
tnf-238 outcome falciparum malaria infection.
