background: invasion mosquito salivary glands (sgs) plasmodium falciparum
sporozoites essential step malaria life cycle. infection
modulates gene expression, affects hematophagy remains unclear.
principal findings: using affimetrix chip microarray, found least 43
genes differentially expressed glands plasmodium
falciparum-infected anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. among upregulated genes,
one codes agaphelin, 58-amino acid protein containing single kazal domain
with leu p1 position. agaphelin displays high homology orthologs
present aedes sp culex sp salivary glands, indicating evolutionarily
expanded family. kinetics surface plasmon resonance experiments determined
that chemically synthesized agaphelin behaves slow tight inhibitor of
neutrophil elastase (k(d) ∼ 10 nm), affect enzymes, nor
promotes vasodilation, exhibit antimicrobial activity. taxiscan chamber assay 
revealed agaphelin inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis toward fmlp, affecting
several parameter associated cell migration. addition, agaphelin reduces 
paw edema formation accumulation tissue myeloperoxidase triggered by
injection carrageenan mice. agaphelin also blocks
elastase/cathepsin-mediated platelet aggregation, abrogates elastase-mediated
cleavage tissue factor pathway inhibitor, attenuates neutrophil-induced
coagulation. notably, agaphelin inhibits neutrophil extracellular traps (nets)
formation prevents fecl3-induced arterial thrombosis, without impairing
hemostasis.
conclusions: blockade neutrophil elastase emerges novel antihemostatic
mechanism hematophagy; also supports notion neutrophils the
innate immune response targets antithrombotic therapy. addition,
agaphelin first antihemostatic whose expression induced plasmodium
sp infection. results suggest important interplay takes place in
parasite-vector-host interactions.
