with increase antibiotic resistance among infectious diseases, need
for new strategies identifying compounds inhibitory effects dire.
traditional methods genome sequencing systematic characterization of
potential antimicrobial gene clusters, although effective, unfortunately 
yielding results speed consistent rise antimicrobial resistance.
one approach could use targeted approach antimicrobial compound
discovery. insect vectors often mediate transmissions parasitic infections
for example, leishmaniasis, malaria, trypanosomiasis. within insect,
among pathogens, commensal and/or obligate symbiotic bacteria, which
often undergo population shift upon colonization insect host. the
remaining bacteria may either resistant effects respective
parasites, possibly essential successful colonization continued
spread parasite due obligate symbiosis bacteria insect
host. interestingly, shifts often toward groups bacteria known to
harbor many polyketide synthase non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene
clusters involved bioactive molecule production. perspective explores the
possibility exploit natural interactions parasite, symbiont, and
insect host targeted approach toward natural product discovery, 
environment potential compound producers naturally interfacing with
human pathogens.
