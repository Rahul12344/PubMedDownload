background: cotrimoxazole (ctx) broad-spectrum antimicrobial, combining
trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. ctx prophylaxis reduces mortality and
morbidity among people living hiv regions high prevalence of
bacterial infections malaria. antiretroviral research watoto (arrow) 
trial evaluated effect stopping versus continuing ctx prophylaxis in
sub-saharan africa.
methods: study, 72 hiv-infected zimbabwean children, antiretroviral
therapy, provided fecal samples 84- 96-weeks randomization to
continue stop ctx. dna extracted whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, 
with sequencing reads mapped comprehensive antibiotic resistance database 
(card) identify ctx antimicrobial resistance genes.
results: minimal differences carriage ctx resistance genes
between groups. dfra1 gene, conferring trimethoprim resistance, was
significantly higher continue group (p=0.039) teta(p) gene
conferring resistance tetracycline significantly higher stop group 
(p=0.013). ctx prophylaxis role shaping resistome, however stopping 
prophylaxis decrease resistance gene abundance.
conclusion: differences observed resistance gene carriage 
stop continue groups. previously shown multi-faceted protective effects
of ctx arrow trial clinical outcomes outweighed risk of
multi-drug resistance gene selection due prophylaxis. findings are
reassuring, given current recommendations long-term ctx prophylaxis among
children living hiv sub-saharan africa decrease mortality and
morbidity.
