background: malaria, toll-like receptors (tlrs) recently emerged as
major player innate immunity. however, implication tlr variants clinical
manifestations malaria conflicting. present study aims provide
relevant information growing interest understanding role tlr4d299g, 
tlr9t-1237c tlr9t-1486c polymorphisms clinical outcomes malaria.
methods: genotyped tlr4d299g, tlr9t-1237c tlr9t-1486c polymorphisms by
pcr-rflp methods subsequently analyzed 200 uncomplicated patients 200 
severe patients. further, severe malaria categorized sub-clinical groups
such cerebral malaria (cm), non-cerebral severe malaria (ncsm), single organ
dysfunction (sod) multi-organ dysfunctions (mods) analyzed.
result: tlr9-1237cc genotype observed significantly low frequency in
mods (p=0.0008), heterozygous state (tc) proportionately more
frequent sod (p=0.087) compared mild malaria. tlr9t-1486c
heterozygote common categories severe malaria. however, pair
wise ld analysis revealed significant linkage t-1237c t-1486c,
whereas haplotype analysis showed significantly low frequency c-t haplotype in
cm (p=0.005, pc=0.02) high frequency t-c haplotype ncsm compared 
mild malaria.
conclusion: although tlr9-1237c could risk factor severe malaria in
heterozygous state, negative association cc genotype mods warrants
caution segregating severe malaria sub-clinical groups while
interpreting data. further, clinical outcome malaria observed be
apparently modulated ld tlr9 promoter variants.
