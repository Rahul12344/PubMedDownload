background: host response infection plasmodium falciparum, parasite
most often responsible severe malaria, ranges asymptomatic parasitaemia 
to death. clinical trajectory malaria influenced host genetics and
parasite load, factors determining infections produce
uncomplicated malaria proceed severe disease remain incompletely
understood.
methods: identify molecular markers severe falciparum malaria, human gene
expression patterns compared children aged 6 months 5 years 
severe uncomplicated malaria enrolled case-control study in
bandiagara, mali. microarrays used obtain expression data severe cases
and uncomplicated controls time acute disease presentation (five
uncomplicated five severe), 1 week presentation (three uncomplicated
and three severe) treatment initiation, subsequent dry season
(late convalescence, four uncomplicated four severe). pilot study
for first use microarray technology mali.
results: complement toll-like receptor (tlr) pathways differentially
expressed, severe cases showing higher expression c1q, tlr2, tlr4,
tlr8, cr1 genes. genes previously associated malaria pathogenesis,
gzmb, fos hspa6, also higher among severe cases. tlr2, tlr4, tlr8, cr1, 
gzmb, fos, hspa6 genes expressed lower levels severe cases late
convalescence.
conclusions: overexpression genes previously associated uncomplicated
malaria associated severe disease. low baseline expression these
genes may represent candidate markers severe malaria. despite small
sample size, results pilot study offer promising targets follow-up
analyses.
