the glutathione s-transferase plasmodium falciparum presents distinct
features absent mammalian gst isoenzyme counterparts. most
apparent among ability tetramerize presence a
flexible loop. loop, situated 113-119 residues, reported
necessary tetramerization process. article, report a
residue outside loop, asn112, key process - point
where single asn112leu mutation prevents tetramerization altogether. we
propose structural pattern involving interaction asn112 and
lys117 residues two neighboring subunits plays role keeping the
tetramer structure stable. also report that, tetramerization the
wild-type pfgst occur, phosphate pyrophosphate anions must present. in
other words, tetramerization phosphate- pyrophosphate-induced process.
furthermore, presence magnesium reinforces induction. present
experimental evidence claims well preliminary calorimetric 
kinetic study dimeric asn112leu pfgst mutant. also propose putative
binding site phosphate pyrophosphate anions comparative
structural analysis pfgst pyrophosphatases several organisms. our
results highlight differences pfgst human isoenzymes, which
make parasite enzyme suitable antimalarial target.
