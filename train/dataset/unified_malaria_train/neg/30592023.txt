benign neutropenia, observed different ethnic groups, common form 
of neutropenia worldwide. specific single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2814778,
located promoter ackr1 (previously termed darc) gene, which
disrupts binding site gata1 erythroid transcription factor, resulting
in ackr1-null phenotype, found serve predictor low white blood
cell neutrophil counts african-americans yemenite jews. individuals
with benign neutropenia due ackr1-null allele found an
increased susceptibility human immunodeficiency virus infection and, the
other hand, protective effect malaria. associated protective effect
may explain spread ackr1-null allele natural selection. the
reviewed relationships ackr1 polymorphism various pathological states
may important clinical implications individuals without benign
neutropenia. potential mechanisms ackr1 (previously termed darc) modulation
during neutrophil recruitment inflammation, chemokine bioavailability in
the circulation local tissue reviewed discussed.
