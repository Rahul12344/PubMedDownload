background: proteases regulate pathogenesis apicomplexan parasites but
investigations proteases largely confined asexual stages of
plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii. thus, little known about
proteases apicomplexa, particularly sexual stages. screened
the eimeria tenella genome database proteases, classified families
and determined stage specific expression.
results: forty protease genes identified e. tenella genome.
these distributed across aspartic (three genes), cysteine (sixteen), metallo
(fourteen) serine (twelve) proteases. expression least fifteen protease
genes upregulated merozoites including homologs genes known be
important host cell invasion, remodelling egress p. falciparum and/or
t. gondii. thirteen protease genes specifically expressed upregulated 
gametocytes; five two families serine proteases (s1 s8)
that over-represented coccidian parasites, e. tenella t. gondii,
distinctive within apicomplexa hard-walled oocysts. serine
protease inhibitors prevented processing etgam56, protein e. tenella
gametocytes gives rise tyrosine-rich peptides incorporated 
the oocyst wall.
conclusion: eimeria tenella possesses large number protease genes.
expression many genes upregulated asexual stages. however,
expression almost one-third protease genes upregulated in, confined
to gametocytes; appear unique coccidia may play
key roles formation oocyst wall, defining feature group
of parasites.
