background: pentastomiasis rare zoonotic disease caused pentastomids.
despite worm-like appearance, commonly placed separate
sub-class subphylum crustacea, phylum arthropoda. however, now, 
systematic classification pentastomids diagnosis pentastomiasis
are immature, genetic information pentastomid nylum almost
nonexistent. objective study obtain information pentastomid
nymph genes identify gene homologues related host-parasite
interactions stage-specific antigens.
methodology/principal findings: total pentastomid nymph rna used construct
a cdna library 500 colonies sequenced. analysis shows one hundred and
ninety-seven unigenes identified. which, 147 genes annotated, 75
unigenes (53.19%) mapped 82 kegg pathways, including 29 metabolism
pathways, 29 genetic information processing pathways, 4 environmental information
processing pathways, 7 cell motility pathways 5 organismal systems pathways. 
additionally, two host-parasite interaction-related gene homologues, putative
kunitz inhibitor putative cysteine protease.
conclusion/significance: first successfully constructed cdna library and
gained number expressed sequence tags (est) pentastomid nymphs, which
will lay foundation study pentastomids pentastomiasis.
