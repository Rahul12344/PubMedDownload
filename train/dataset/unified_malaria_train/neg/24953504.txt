control eradication malaria hindered acquisition drug
resistance plasmodium species. necessitated persistent search for
novel drugs efficient targets. plasmodium species specific lactate
dehydrogenase one potential therapeutic diagnostic targets, because
of indispensable role endoerythrocytic stage parasite. target
molecule highly conserved parasite population more
effectively used diagnostics therapeutics, hence, present study
polymorphism pfldh (plasmodiumfalciparum specific ldh) pvldh
(plasmodiumvivax specific ldh) genes analyzed using pcr-single strand
confirmation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) sequencing. forty-six p. falciparum 
thirty-five p. vivax samples screened different states india. our
findings revealed presence single pfldh genotype six pvldh
genotypes among studied samples. interestingly, along synonymous
substitutions, nonsynonymous substitutions reported present the
first time pvldh genotypes. further, amino acid sequence alignment
and homology modeling studies observed catalytic residues were
conserved pvldh genotypes nonsynonymous substitutions not
altered enzyme structure significantly. evolutionary genetics studies have
confirmed pfldh pvldh loci strong purifying selection.
phylogenetic analysis pldh gene sequences revealed p. falciparum
compared p. vivax, recent origin. study therefore supports pfldh and
pvldh suitable therapeutic diagnostic targets well phylogenetic
markers understand genealogy malaria species.
