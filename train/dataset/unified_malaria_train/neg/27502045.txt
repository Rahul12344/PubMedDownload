background: saurian malaria parasites diverse apicomplexan blood parasites
including family plasmodiidae mesnil, 1903, studied since the
early 1900s. currently, least 27 species plasmodium recorded african
lizards, date two species, plasmodium zonuriae (pienaar, 1962) and
plasmodium cordyli telford, 1987, reported african endemic
family cordylidae. paper presents description new malaria parasite in
a cordylid lizard provides phylogenetic hypothesis saurian plasmodium
species south africa. furthermore, provides tabular review the
plasmodium species date formally described infecting species of
african lizards.
methods: blood samples collected 77 specimens pseudocordylus
melanotus (a. smith, 1838) platberg reserve eastern free state, and
two specimens cordylus vittifer (reichenow, 1887) roodewalshoek
conservancy mpumalanga (south africa). blood smears giemsa-stained,
screened haematozoa, specifically saurian malaria parasites, parasite stages 
were photographed measured. small volume also preserved tem
studies. plasmodium haemoproteus primer sets, nested-polymerase chain 
reaction (pcr) protocol, employed target fragment cytochrome-b
(cyt-b) gene region. resulting sequences saurian plasmodium species'
isolates compared known plasmodium spp.
sequences genbank database.
results: presence p. zonuriae specimens type lizard host c.
vittifer confirmed using morphological characteristics, subsequently
allowed species' molecular characterisation. 77 p. melanotus, 44
were parasitised plasmodium species, compared morphologically 
other african saurian plasmodium spp. molecularly p. zonuriae, supported
its description new species plasmodium intabazwe n. sp.
conclusions: first morphological molecular account plasmodium 
species within african endemic family cordylidae south africa. study
highlights need molecular analysis cordylid plasmodium species
within africa. future studies also include elucidating life-cycles 
of species, thus promoting use morphological molecular
characteristics species descriptions saurian malaria parasites.
