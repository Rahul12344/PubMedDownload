background: increasing resistance plasmodium, malaria parasites, to
multiple commonly used drugs underscored urgent need develop effective
antimalarial drugs vaccines. new direction genomics-driven target
discovery become possible completion parasite genome sequencing, 
which lead us better understanding parasites develop the
genetic variability associated response environmental
challenges adaptive phenotypes.
results: present results comprehensive analysis genomes six
plasmodium species, including two species infect humans, one infects
monkeys, three infect rodents. core genome shared six species
is composed 3,351 genes, make 22%-65% genome repertoire.
these components play important roles fundamental functions well in
parasite-specific activities. investigated distribution and
features genes expanded specific plasmodium lineage(s).
abundant duplicate genes present six species, 5%-9% whole 
genomes composed lineage specific radiations. majority gene families
are hypothetical proteins unknown functions; may predicted roles 
such antigenic variation.
conclusions: core genome components malaria parasites functions
ranging fundamental biological processes roles complex networks
that sustain parasite-specific lifestyles appropriate different hosts.
they represent minimum requirement maintain successful life cycle that
spans vertebrate hosts mosquito vectors. lineage specific expansions (lses)
have given rise abundant gene families plasmodium. although functions
of families remain unknown, lses could reveal components parasite
networks that, enhanced genetic variability, contribute to
pathogenesis, virulence, responses environmental challenges, interesting
phenotypes.
