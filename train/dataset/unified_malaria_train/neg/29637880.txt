cholangiocarcinoma (cca), malignant tumor bile duct, major public
health problem many southeast asian countries, particularly thailand. slow
progression makes difficult early diagnosis patients detected
in advanced stages. study aimed review relevant articles related to
the biomarkers diagnosis cca point potential biomarkers. a
thorough search performed pubmed sciencedirect cca biomarker
articles. required data extracted. total 46 articles fulfilled the
inclusion none exclusion criteria included analysis
(17, 22, 3, 4, 1 articles blood, tissue, bile, blood tissue, 
urine biomarkers, respectively). carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (ca19-9) and
carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), either alone combination other
biomarkers, commonly studied biomarkers serum. their
sensitivity specificity ranged 47.2% 98.2% 89.7% 100%,
respectively. however, tissue, gene methylations dna-related markers
were studied cca biomarkers. sensitivity specificity ranged
from 58% 87% 98% 100%, respectively. articles investigated
biomarkers blood tissues, particularly ca19-9 cea, with
sensitivity specificity ranging 33% 100% 50% 97.7%,
respectively. although quite number biomarkers potential role 
early detection cca established, difficult single any
particular marker could used routine clinical settings.
