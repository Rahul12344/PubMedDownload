recombinant adenoviral vectors (rads) lead vaccine candidates protection 
against variety pathogens, including ebola, hiv, tuberculosis, malaria, 
due ability potently induce cell immunity humans. however, the
ability induce protective cellular immunity varies among rads. here, we
assessed mechanisms control potency cd8 cell responses in
murine models following vaccination human-, chimpanzee-, simian-derived 
rads encoding siv-gag antigen (ag). rad vaccination, quantified ag
expression performed expression profiling innate immune response genes 
the draining lymph node. human-derived rad5 chimpanzee-derived chad3 the
most potent rads induced high persistent ag expression low innate
gene activation, less potent rads induced less ag expression robustly
induced innate immunity genes primarily associated ifn signaling. 
abrogation type ifn stimulator ifn genes (sting) signaling increased
ag expression accelerated cd8 cell response kinetics alter
memory responses protection. findings reveal magnitude of
rad-induced memory cd8 cell immune responses correlates ag expression 
is independent ifn sting provide criteria optimizing protective
cd8 cell immunity rad vaccines.
