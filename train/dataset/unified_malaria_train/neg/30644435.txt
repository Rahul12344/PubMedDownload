there large genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum strains infect
people causing diverse malaria symptoms. study carried explore
the effect mixed-strain infections extent specific p.
falciparum variants associated particular malaria symptoms. p.
falciparum isolates collected pharmacovigilance study nanoro, burkina
faso used determine allelic variation two polymorphic antigens 
merozoite surface (msp1 msp2). overall, parasite density increase
with additional strains, suggesting existence within-host competition.
parasite density influenced msp1 allelic families highest
parasitaemia observed mad20 allelic family. however, mixed infections 
with allelic family k1, mad20 could grow levels would
alone, suggesting competitive suppression mixed infections. host age was
associated parasite density. overall, older patients exhibited lower
parasite densities younger patients, effect varied genetic
composition isolates msp1 gene. effect msp1 and
msp2 allelic family variation body temperature. haemoglobin level was
influenced msp2 family patients harboring fc27 allele showing lower
haemoglobin level mono-infected individuals 3d7 allele. study
provides evidence p. falciparum genetic diversity influenced severity of
particular malaria symptoms supports existence within-host competition
in genetically diverse p. falciparum.
