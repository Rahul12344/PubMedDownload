artemisia annua, produces anti-malaria compound artemisinin, occurs 
high-artemisinin production (hap) low-artemisinin production (lap)
chemotypes. understanding basis difference chemotypes
would assist breeding optimising artemisinin biosynthesis. present 
systematic comparison artemisinin biosynthesis genes may involved in
determining chemotype (cyp71av1, dbr2 aldh1). genes isolated
from two chemotypes characterized using transient expression planta.
the enzyme activity dbr2 aldh1 two chemotypes differ, but
structural differences cyp71av1 lap hap chemotypes (amolap and
amohap, respectively) resulted altered enzyme activity. amolap displays a
seven amino acids n-terminal extension compared amohap. gfp fusion of
both proteins show equal localization er amohap may reduced
stability. upon transient expression nicotiana benthamiana, amolap displayed a
higher enzyme activity amohap. however, expression combination the
other pathway genes also resulted qualitatively different product profile
('chemotype'); is, shift ratio unsaturated and
saturated (dihydro) branch pathway.
