background: detection plasmodium antigens provides evidence malaria
infection status basis malaria diagnosis.
methods: developed sensitive bead-based multiplex assay laboratory use, 
which simultaneously detects pan-plasmodium aldolase (paldo), pan-plasmodium
lactate dehydrogenase (pldh), p. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2)
antigens. assay validated purified recombinant antigens,
monospecies malaria infections, noninfected blood samples. test against
samples collected endemic setting, angolan outpatient samples (n = 1267)
were assayed.
results: 466 angolan samples positive least 1 antigen, common 
antigen profiles pfhrp2+/paldo+/pldh+ (167, 36%), pfhrp2+/paldo-/pldh- (163,
35%), pfhrp2+/paldo+/pldh- (129, 28%). antigen profile predictive of
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) positivity parasite density. eight angolan
samples (1.7%) low pfhrp2 positive 1 the
other antigens. pcr analysis confirmed 3 (0.6%) p. ovale infections 2
(0.4%) represented p. falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3.
conclusions: first reports pfhrp2/3 deletion mutants angola. 
high-throughput multiplex antigen detection inexpensively screen for
low-density p. falciparum, non-falciparum, pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites to
provide population-level antigen estimates identify specimens requiring
further molecular characterization.
