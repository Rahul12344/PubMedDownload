the glucose transporter pfht essential survival malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum shown druggable target high
potential pharmacological intervention. identification compounds against
novel drug targets crucial combating resistance current
therapeutics. here, describe development cell-based assay system
readily adaptable high-throughput screening directly measures compound
effects pfht-mediated glucose transport. intracellular glucose concentrations 
are detected using genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(fret)-based glucose sensor. allows assessment ability small
molecules inhibit glucose uptake high accuracy (z' factor >0.8),
thereby eliminating need radiolabeled substrates. furthermore, have
adapted assay counterscreen pfht hits human orthologues
glut1, -2, -3, -4. report identification several hits after
screening medicines malaria venture (mmv) malaria box, library 400
compounds known inhibit erythrocytic development p. falciparum hit
compounds characterized determining half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (ic50) uptake radiolabeled glucose isolated p.
falciparum parasites. one hits, compound mmv009085, shows high potency and
orthologue selectivity, thereby successfully validating assay for
antimalarial screening.
