background: first study conducted introduction of
artemisinin-combination therapy (act), major objective evaluate
plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity multiplicity infection isolates
from congolese children one nine years age enrolled followed
up one year. secondary objective characterize msp2 profiles of
p. falciparum isolates collected successive malaria episodes ten children
who four clinical episodes follow up.
methods: three-hundred thirteen children residing southern part of
brazzaville participated study. blood samples obtained all
children enrollment checked p. falciparum infection. based one 
year follow-up data, two clinical groups considered according number 
of malaria episodes presented follow period: "protected"(children who
did experience episode) "unprotected" (those experienced more
that two episodes). therefore, msp2 genetic diversity p. falciparum
isolates collected enrollment two groups characterized by
allele-specific nested pcr compared. msp2 profiles p. falciparum
isolates collected successive malaria episodes also characterized by
allele-specific nested pcr.
results: forty-three percent fc27 fifty-seven percent 3d7 protected 
vs fifty-six percent fc27 forty-four percent 3d7 isolates from
unprotected children detected. seven two alleles belonging fc27, 
and six three alleles belonging 3d7 families distinguished in
isolates protected unprotected children respectively. mean
multiplicity infection (moi) values inclusion msp2 locus 1.29
and 1.43 protected unprotected children respectively. 43 isolates were
obtained ten children four clinical episodes 
follow up. total 63 alleles fragments corresponding 57% (36/63) fc27
and 43% (27/63) 3d7 detected. variant 400bp fc27 most
prevalent. 46% (20/43), 42% (18/43), 2% (1/43) 2% (1/43) isolates were
found 1, 2, 3 4 parasite genotypes respectively mean moi 
1.78.
conclusion: study shows introduction act republic of
congo reduced moi genetic diversity p. falciparum isolates
from children living southern districts brazzaville.
