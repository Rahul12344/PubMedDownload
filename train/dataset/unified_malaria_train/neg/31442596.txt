background: gut parasites exert important influence gut microbiome,
with many studies focusing human gut microbiome. has, however,
undergone severe richness depletion. hygienic lifestyle, antimicrobial treatments
and altered gut homeostasis (e.g., chronic inflammation) reduce gut microbiome
richness also parasite prevalence; may confound results. studying
species closely related humans could help overcome problem providing
insights ancestral relationship humans, gut microbiome and
their gut parasites. chimpanzees particularly promising model 
similar gut microbiomes humans many parasites infect species.
aims: study interaction gut microbiome enteric parasites in
chimpanzees. investigating novel insights closely related species can
reveal compared studies humans.
methods: using eighty-seven faecal samples wild western chimpanzees (pan
troglodytes verus) senegal, combine 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for
gut microbiome characterization pcr detection parasite taxa (blastocystis
sp., strongyloides spp., giardia duodenalis, cryptosporidium spp., plasmodium
spp., filariae trypanosomatidae). test differences gut microbiota
ecosystem traits taxonomical composition blastocystis and
strongyloides bearing non-bearing samples.
results: blastocystis, twelve differentially abundant taxa (e.g.,
methanobrevibacter), including prevotella ruminococcus-methanobrevibacter
enterotype markers, replicate findings humans. however, several richness
indices lower blastocystis carriers, contradicting human studies. this
indicates blastocystis, unlike strongyloides, associated "poor health"
gut microbiome, fact faecalibacterium, bacterium gut
protective traits, absent blastocystis-positive samples. strongyloides 
associated alloprevotella five taxonomic groups. parasite had
its unique impact gut microbiota indicating parasite-specific niches. 
results suggest studying gut microbiomes wild chimpanzees could help 
disentangle biological artefactual associations gut microbiomes 
parasites.
