background: accurate detection blood protozoa clinical samples is
important diagnosis, treatment control related diseases. this
preliminary study, novel dna microarray system assessed detection
of plasmodium, leishmania, trypanosoma, toxoplasma gondii babesia humans, 
animals, vectors, comparison microscopy pcr data. developing a
rapid, simple, convenient detection method protozoan detection an
urgent need.
methodology/principal findings: microarray assay simultaneously identified 18
species common blood protozoa based differences respective target
genes. total 20 specific primer pairs 107 microarray probes were
selected according conserved regions designed identify 18
species 5 blood protozoan genera. positive detection rate the
microarray assay 91.78% (402/438). sensitivity specificity blood
protozoan detection ranged 82.4% (95%ci: 65.9% ~ 98.8%) 100.0% 95.1% 
(95%ci: 93.2% ~ 97.0%) 100.0%, respectively. positive predictive value (ppv)
and negative predictive value (npv) ranged 20.0% (95%ci: 2.5% ~ 37.5%) to
100.0% 96.8% (95%ci: 95.0% ~ 98.6%) 100.0%, respectively. youden index
varied 0.82 0.98. detection limit dna microarrays ranged 
200 500 copies/reaction, similar pcr findings. concordance rate between
microarray data dna sequencing results 100%.
conclusions/significance: overall, newly developed microarray platform
provides convenient, highly accurate, reliable clinical assay the
determination blood protozoan species.
