background: genetic diversity malaria parasites reflects complexity
and size parasite populations. study designed explore the
genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum populations collected two
southeastern areas (shwekyin myawaddy bordering thailand) one western
area (kyauktaw bordering bangladesh) myanmar.
methods: total 267 blood samples collected patients acute p.
falciparum infections 2009 2010 used genotyping the
merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), msp2 glutamate-rich protein (glurp) loci.
results: one hundred eighty four samples successfully genotyped three
genes. allelic distributions three genes significantly
different among three areas. mad20 3d7 prevalent alleles in
three areas msp1 msp2, respectively. glurp allele bin size 
700-750 bp prevalent shwekyin myawaddy, whereas two
alleles bin sizes 800-850 bp 900-1000 bp prevalent in
the western site kyauktaw. overall, 73.91% samples contained multiclonal
infections, resulting mean multiplicity infection (moi) 1.94.
interestingly, moi level presented rising trend order myawaddy,
kyauktaw shwekyin, also paralleled increasing frequencies of
msp1 ro33 msp2 fc27 200-250 bp alleles. msp1 msp2 genes displayed higher 
levels diversity higher moi rates glurp. pcr revealed four samples
(two shwekyin two myawaddy) mixed infections p. falciparum 
and p. vivax.
conclusions: study genotyped parasite clinical samples two southeast
regions one western state myanmar msp1, msp2 glurp loci, 
revealed high levels genetic diversity mixed-strain infections p.
falciparum populations sites. results indicated malaria
transmission intensity regions remained high strengthened
control efforts needed. genotypic data provided baseline information 
monitoring impacts malaria elimination efforts region.
