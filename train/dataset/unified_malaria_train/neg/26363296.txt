transposable elements (tes) widespread insect's genomes. however, there
are wide differences proportion total dna content occupied these
repetitive sequences different species. analyzed tes present r.
prolixus (vector chagas disease) showed 3.0% genome is
occupied class ii tes, belonging mainly tc1-mariner superfamily (1.65%)
and mites (1.84%). interestingly, genomic content due the
expansion two subfamilies belonging to: irritans himar, well characterized
subfamily mariners, prolixus1, one two novel subfamilies here
described. high amount sequences subfamilies suggests bursts
of transposition occurred life cycle family. attempt 
characterize elements, performed silico analysis sequences 
corresponding ddd/e domain transposase gene. performed an
evolutionary analysis including network bayesian coalescent-based methods 
order infer dynamics amplification, well estimate time
of bursts identified subfamilies. given data, hypothesized
that te expansions occurred around time speciation r. prolixus
around 1.4 mya. suggestion lays "transposon model" te evolution,
in members te population replicative active present
at multiple loci genome, replicative potential varies, of
the "life cycle model" states present-day tes involved
in amplification bursts, share ancestral copy dates back this
initial amplification.
