the endoplasmic reticulum (er) thought play essential role egress
of malaria parasites er assumed required biogenesis 
secretion egress-related organelles. however, proteins localized the
parasite er shown play role egress malaria parasites. in
this study, generated conditional mutants plasmodium falciparum
endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium-binding protein (pferc), member the
crec family. knockdown pferc gene showed gene essential for
asexual growth p. falciparum analysis intraerythrocytic life cycle
revealed pferc essential parasite egress required for
protein trafficking calcium storage. found pferc knockdown prevents
the rupture parasitophorous vacuole membrane. pferc
knockdown inhibited proteolytic maturation subtilisin-like serine
protease sub1. using double mutant parasites, showed pferc required
for proteolytic maturation essential aspartic protease plasmepsin x,
which required sub1 cleavage. further, showed processing of
substrates downstream proteolytic cascade inhibited pferc knockdown.
thus, data establish er-resident crec family protein pferc a
key early regulator egress proteolytic cascade malaria
parasites.importance divergent eukaryotic parasites cause malaria grow
and divide within vacuole inside host cell, break open
once finish cell division. egress daughter parasites requires the
activation proteolytic cascade, subtilisin-like protease initiates a
proteolytic cascade break membranes blocking egress. assumed
that parasite endoplasmic reticulum plays role process, the
proteins organelle required egress remain unknown. identified
an early er-resident regulator essential maturation recently
discovered aspartic protease egress proteolytic cascade, plasmepsin x,
which required maturation subtilisin-like protease. conditional
loss pferc results formation immature inactive egress proteases 
that unable breakdown vacuolar membrane barring release daughter
parasites.
