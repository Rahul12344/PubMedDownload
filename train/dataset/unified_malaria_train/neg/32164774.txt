background: apicomplexans causative agents major human diseases such
as malaria toxoplasmosis. novel group apicomplexans, recently named
corallicolids, detected corals inhabiting tropical shallow reefs.
these apicomplexans may represent transitional lifestyle free-living
phototrophs obligate parasites. shed light evolutionary history 
apicomplexans investigate ecology association corals, we
screened scleractinians, antipatharians, alcyonaceans, zoantharians from
shallow, mesophotic, deep-sea communities. detected corallicolid plastids 
using 16s metabarcoding, sequenced nuclear 18s rrna gene corallicolids
from selected samples, assembled annotated plastid mitochondrial
genomes corallicolid associates deep-sea coral, screened
the metagenomes four coral species corallicolids.
results: detected 23 corallicolid plastotypes associated 14
coral species three orders depths 1400Â m. individual plastotypes
were restricted coral hosts within single depth zone within single
taxonomic order corals. clusters closely related corallicolids were
revealed associated closely related coral species. however, the
presence divergent corallicolid lineages associated similar coral
species depths suggests corallicolid/coral relations flexible over
evolutionary timescales large diversity apicomplexans may remain
undiscovered. corallicolid plastid genome deep-sea coral contained
four genes involved chlorophyll biosynthesis: three genes lipor
complex acsf.
conclusions: presence corallicolid apicomplexans corals the
photic zone demonstrates restricted shallow-water reefs 
are general anthozoan symbionts. presence lipor genes deep-sea
corallicolid precludes role involving photosynthesis suggests may be
involved different function. thus, genes may represent another set 
genetic tools whose function adapted photosynthesis ancestors 
apicomplexans evolved towards parasitic lifestyles. video abstract.
