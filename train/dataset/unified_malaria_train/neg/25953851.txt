the meme suite powerful, integrated set web-based tools studying
sequence motifs proteins, dna rna. motifs encode many biological
functions, detection characterization important study 
molecular interactions cell, including regulation gene expression. 
since previous description meme suite 2009 nucleic acids
research web server issue, added six new tools. describe the
capabilities tools within suite, give advice best use and
provide several case studies illustrate combine results various
