numerous dna- rna-level functions embedded protein-coding regions,
which constrains structure, function, evolution. accumulating evidence 
suggests additional, overlapping functions occur preferentially 
coding sequences intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (idps/idrs),
especially newly incorporated thus reduced selective
pressure. lack strict structural constraints makes disordered
proteins tolerant mutations thus permissive appearance of
overlapping functions within coding sequences structured domains.
therefore, idps/idrs often mosaics segments fulfilling protein
functionalities intervening regions primarily carrying nucleotide-level
functions. ensuing complexification gene-regulatory circuits may have
contributed evolutionary spread structural disorder complex
eukaryotic organisms.
