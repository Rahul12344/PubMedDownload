the three main mosquito genera, anopheles, aedes culex, transmit respectively
malaria, dengue lymphatic filariasis. current mosquito control strategies
have proved unsuccessful, still substantial number morbidity
and mortality diseases. genetic control methods arisen as
promising alternative strategies, based two approaches: replacement a
vector population disease-refractory mosquitoes release mosquitoes 
carrying lethal gene suppress target populations. however, substantial
hurdles limitations need overcome methods used
successfully, significant transgenic mosquito strain is
required every target species, making genetically modified mosquito
strategies inviable multiple vector mosquitoes area.
genetically modified bacteria capable colonizing wide range mosquito
species may solution problem another option control of
these diseases. paratransgenic approach, symbiotic bacteria are
genetically modified reintroduced mosquitoes, express effector 
molecules. approach used practice, however, requires better
understanding mosquito microbiota symbiotic bacteria effector
molecules identified. paratransgenesis could prove useful mosquito
species inherently difficult transform sibling species
complexes. approach, genetic modified bacteria act by: (a) causing 
pathogenic effects host; (b) interfering host's reproduction; (c)
reducing vector's competence; (d) interfering oogenesis and
embryogenesis. much flexible adaptable approach use 
genetically modified mosquitoes effector molecules symbiotic bacteria
can replaced achieve desired result. paratransgenesis may
therefore become important integrated pest management tool mosquito
control.
