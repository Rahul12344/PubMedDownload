the prevalence plasmodium vivax increasing border regions of
thailand; one potential problem confounding control malaria these
regions emergence spread drug resistance. aim study was
to determine genetic diversity genes potentially linked drug resistance
in p. vivax parasites isolated four different border regions thailand;
thai-myanmar (tak, mae hong son prachuap khiri khan provinces), and
thai-cambodian borders (chanthaburi province). isolates collected 345
p. vivax patients 2008 2014, parasite dna extracted subjected to
nucleotide sequencing five putative drug-resistance loci (pvdhfr, pvdhps,
pvmdr1, pvcrt-o pvk12). prevalence mutations pvdhfr, pvdhps and
pvmdr1 markedly different thai-myanmar thai-cambodian border
areas also varied sampling times. isolates carried pvdhfr
(58r 117n/t) mutation, however, whereas quadruple mutant allele
(i57r58m61t117) prevalent (69.6%) thai-myanmar border region,
the double mutant allele (f57r58t61n117) fixation thai-cambodian
border (100%). prevalent genotypes pvdhps pvmdr1 double 
mutant (s382g383k512g553) (65.1%) single mutant (m958y976f1076) (46.5%)
alleles, respectively thai-myanmar border single pvdhps mutant
(s382g383k512a553) (52.7%) triple pvmdr1 mutant (m958f976l1076) (81%)
alleles dominant thai-cambodian border. mutations observed in
the pvcrt-o gene either region. novel mutations pvk12 gene, p.
vivax orthologue pfk13, linked artemisinin resistance plasmodium
falciparum, observed three nonsynonymous three synonymous mutations
in six isolates (3.3%).
