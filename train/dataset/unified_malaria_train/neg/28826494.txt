the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum related apicomplexan pathogens
contain essential plastid organelle, apicoplast, key
anti-parasitic target. derived secondary endosymbiosis, apicoplast
depends novel, largely cryptic, mechanisms protein/lipid import and
organelle inheritance parasite replication. critical biogenesis
pathways present untapped opportunities discover new parasite-specific drug
targets. used innovative screen identify actinonin novel
mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. resistant mutation,
chemical-genetic interaction, biochemical inhibition demonstrate the
unexpected target actinonin p. falciparum toxoplasma gondii ftsh1, a
homolog bacterial membrane aaa+ metalloprotease. pfftsh1 first novel 
factor required apicoplast biogenesis identified phenotypic screen. 
findings demonstrate ftsh1 novel and, importantly, druggable
antimalarial target. development ftsh1 inhibitors significant
advantages improved drug kinetics multistage efficacy multiple
human parasites.
