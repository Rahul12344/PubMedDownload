background: immune response plasmodium vivax immunogenic epitopes 
regulated pro- anti-inflammatory cytokines determine antibody levels 
and class switching. cytokine gene polymorphisms may responsible changes
in humoral immune response malaria. aim study to
evaluate whether polymorphisms tnfa, ifng il10 genes would alter the
levels anti-pvama1, pvdbp -pvmsp-119 igg antibodies patients vivax
malaria.
methods: samples 90 vivax malaria-infected 51 uninfected subjects from
an endemic area brazilian amazon genotyped using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) identify
polymorphisms genes tnfa (-1031t > c, -308g > a, -238g > a), ifng
(+874t > a) il10 (-819c > t, -592c > a). levels total igg against
pvama1, pvdbp pvmsp-119 determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (elisa). associations polymorphisms antibody response
were assessed means logistic regression models.
results: significant differences found levels igg antibodies
against pvama-1, pvdbp pvmsp-119 proteins relation studied
polymorphisms.
conclusions: although associations found among evaluated genotypes
and alleles anti-merozoite igg class p. vivax antibody levels, study
helps elucidate immunogenic profile involved humoral immune response
in malaria.
