empirical evidence suggests malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
employs broad range mechanisms regulate gene transcription throughout the
organism's complex life cycle. better understand regulatory machinery, we
assembled rich collection genomic epigenomic data sets, including
information transcription factor (tf) binding motifs, patterns covalent 
histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy, gc content, global 3d genome
architecture. used data train machine learning models discriminate
between high-expression low-expression genes, focusing three distinct
stages red blood cell phase plasmodium life cycle. results
highlight importance histone modifications 3d chromatin architecture
in plasmodium transcriptional regulation suggest ap2 transcription
factors may play limited regulatory role, perhaps operating conjunction with
epigenetic factors.
