case fatality rates severe malaria remain high even best clinical
settings antimalarial drugs act parasite without alleviating 
life-threatening inflammation. assessed potential host-directed
therapy severe malaria new class anti-inflammatory drugs, innate
defense regulator (idr) peptides, based host defense peptides. plasmodium 
berghei anka model experimental cerebral malaria adapted use a
preclinical screen combining late-stage intervention established infections
with advanced bioinformatic analysis early transcriptional changes in
co-regulated gene sets. coadministration idr-1018 standard first-line
antimalarials increased survival infected mice down-regulating key
inflammatory networks associated fatality. thus, idr peptides provided
host-directed adjunctive therapy severe disease combination with
antimalarial treatment.
