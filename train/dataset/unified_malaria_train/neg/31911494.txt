erythrocyte-binding-like (ebl) proteins known play important role in
malaria parasite invasion red blood cells (rbcs); however, roles ebl
proteins regulating host immune responses remain unknown. here, show that
plasmodium yoelii ebl (pyebl) shape disease severity modulating the
surface structure infected rbcs (irbcs) host immune responses. we
identified amino acid substitution (a change c position 741
[c741y]) protein trafficking domain pyebl isogenic p. yoellii
nigeriensis strain n67 n67c parasites produce different disease
phenotypes c57bl/6 mice. exchanges c741y alleles altered parasite
growth host survival accordingly. c741y substitution also changed protein
processing trafficking merozoites cytoplasm irbcs, reduced
pyebl binding band 3, increased phosphatidylserine (ps) surface exposure, 
elevated osmotic fragility irbcs, affect invasion rbcs
in vitro modified irbc surface triggered ps-cd36-mediated phagocytosis of
irbcs, host type interferon (ifn-i) signaling, cell differentiation,
leading improved host survival. study reveals previously unknown role
of pyebl regulating host-pathogen interaction innate immune responses,
which may explored developing disease control strategies.importance
malaria deadly parasitic disease continues afflict hundreds of
millions people every year. infections malaria parasites be
asymptomatic, mild symptoms, fatal, depending delicate balance of
host immune responses. malaria parasites enter host red blood cells (rbcs)
through interactions parasite ligands host receptors, as
erythrocyte-binding-like (ebl) proteins host duffy antigen receptor for
chemokines (darc). plasmodium yoelii ebl (pyebl) known play role in
parasite invasion rbcs. here, show pyebl also affects disease severity
through modulation host immune responses, particularly type interferon
(ifn-i) signaling. discovery assigns new function pyebl provides 
mechanism developing disease control strategies.
