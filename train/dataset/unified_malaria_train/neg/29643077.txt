sexual reproduction obligate step plasmodium falciparum life cycle, 
with mature gametocytes form parasite capable of
human-to-mosquito transmission. development male female gametocytes takes 
9 12 days, although 300 genes thought specific to
gametocytes, postulated male female specific.
because genes often expressed late gametocyte stages for
some, male- female-specific transcript expression debated, separation
of male female populations technically challenging. overcome these
challenges, developed unbiased single-cell approach determine which
transcripts expressed male versus female gametocytes. using microfluidic
technology, isolated single mid- late-stage gametocytes compare the
expression 91 genes, including 87 gametocyte-specific genes, 90 cells. such
analysis identified distinct gene clusters whose expression associated with
male, female, gametocytes. addition, small number male gametocytes
clustered separately female gametocytes based sex-specific expression
independent stage. many female-enriched genes also exhibited stage-specific
expression. rna fluorescent situ hybridization male female markers
validated mutually exclusive expression pattern male female
transcripts gametocytes. analyses uncovered novel male female
markers expressed early stage iii gametocytogenesis, providing
further insight plasmodium sex-specific differentiation previously masked in
population analyses. single-cell approach reveals robust markers for
sex-specific differentiation plasmodium gametocytes. single-cell
expression assays generalized eukaryotic pathogens.importance 
human deaths result malaria caused eukaryotic parasite
plasmodium falciparum form parasite transmitted the
mosquito sexual form, called gametocyte. production mature
gametocytes take 2 weeks results phenotypically distinct males
and females, although causes gender-specific differentiation remains
largely unknown. here, demonstrate first use microfluidic technology to
capture single gametocytes determine temporal sex-specific gene
expression unbiased manner. able determine male female
identity single cells based upregulation gender-specific genes as
early mid-stage gametocytes. analysis revealed strong markers for
male female gametocyte differentiation previously concealed in
population analyses. similar single-cell analyses eukaryotic pathogens using
this method may uncover rare cell types heterogeneity previously masked in
population studies.
