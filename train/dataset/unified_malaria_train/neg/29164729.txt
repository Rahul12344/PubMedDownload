lipocalins low molecular weight membrane transporters abundantly
expressed salivary glands tissues ticks. study, we
identified lipocalin-like molecule, designated otlip, soft ticks
ornithodoros turicata, vector relapsing fever causing spirochete
borrelia turicatae. noted expression otlip developmentally
regulated, adult ticks expressing significantly higher levels comparison 
to larvae nymphal ticks. expression otlip evident fed and
unfed o. turicata ticks, significantly increased expression salivary 
glands comparison midgut ovary tissues. high conservation the
biogenic amine-binding motif evident deduced primary amino acid
sequence otlip. protein modelling otlip revealed conservation of
the residues involved binding histamine serotonin ligand. vitro assays
demonstrated binding recombinant otlip histamine. furthermore, prediction
of post-translational modifications revealed otlip contained phosphorylation
and myristoylation sites. taken together, study provides evidence
for presence lipocalin-like molecule o. turicata ticks also
suggests role molecule salivary glands medically
important vector.
