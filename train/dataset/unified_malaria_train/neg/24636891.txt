trichinellosis public health problem regarded an
emergent/re-emergent disease various countries. cdna encoding a
cystatin-like protein (ts-cystatin) identified immunoscreening intestinal 
muscle larvae cdna libraries serum pigs experimentally infected with
20,000 trichinella spiralis muscle larvae. study impact host immunity, 
we chose eukaryotic expression system based several comparisons of
immunogenicity two salmonella typhimurium administration schemes,
which indicated eukaryotic expression system superior. humoral igg
and mucosal iga measured determine antibody response. explore
whether th1 th2 responses responsible induced protection, th1-
and th2-specific cellular transcription factors cytokine profile were
examined. changes lymphocyte macrophage populations detected by
flow cytometry. lastly, parasitological examination examined. results
showed ts-cystatin induced th1/th2-mixed type immune response and
decreased stat6 transcription. intestinal adult recovery increased 10.9%
in ts-cystatin group, ts-cystatin group fecundity rate decreased by
91%. furthermore, number muscle larvae change compared the
control group. conclusion, results suggest ts-cystatin plays an
important role trichinella resistance rapid expulsion host is
worth study.
