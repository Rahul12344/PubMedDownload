background: plasmodium species feature four eight nuclear ribosomal units
on different chromosomes, assumed evolve independently according 
a birth-and-death model, new variants originate duplication and
others deleted throughout time. moreover, distinct ribosomal units shown
to expressed different developmental stages vertebrate and
mosquito hosts. here, 18s rdna sequences 32 species avian
haemosporidian parasites reported compared simian rodent 
plasmodium species.
methods: almost entire 18s rdnas avian haemosporidians belonging the
genera plasmodium (7), haemoproteus (9), leucocytozoon (16) obtained 
pcr, molecular cloning, sequencing ten clones each. phylogenetic trees were
calculated sequence patterns analysed compared simian
and rodent malaria species. section mitochondrial cytb also
sequenced.
results: sequence patterns avian plasmodium species similar those
in mammalian parasites species featuring two distinct 18s rdna
sequence clusters. distinct 18s variants also found haemoproteus
tartakovskyi three leucocytozoon species, whereas species
featured sets similar haplotypes. 18s rdna gc-contents the
leucocytozoon toddi complex subgenus parahaemoproteus extremely high
with 49.3% 44.9%, respectively. 18s sequences several species all
three genera showed chimeric features, thus indicating recombination.
conclusion: gene duplication events leading two diverged main sequence
clusters happened independently least six seven avian plasmodium
species, thus supporting evolution according birth-and-death model like
proposed ribosomal units simian rodent plasmodium species.
patterns similar 18s rdnas leucocytozoon toddi complex and
haemoproteus tartakovskyi. however, 18s rdnas species seem to
evolve concerted fashion like eukaryotes, presence chimeric
variants indicates ribosomal units rather evolve semi-concerted
manner. new data may provide basis studies testing whether differential
expression distinct 18s rdna also occurs avian plasmodium species and
related haemosporidian parasites.
