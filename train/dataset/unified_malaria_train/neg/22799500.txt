background: severe malaria attributed expression restricted 
subset var multi-gene family, encodes plasmodium falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1). pfemp1 mediates cytoadherence and
sequestration infected erythrocytes post-capillary venules vital
organs brain, lung placenta. var genes highly diverse 
be classified three major groups (ups a, b c) two intermediate groups 
(b/a b/c) based genomic location, gene orientation upstream
sequences. genetic diversity expressed var genes relation severity
of disease tanzanian children analysed.
methods: children defined severe (sm) asymptomatic malaria (am) were
recruited. full-length var mrna isolated reversed transcribed var
cdna. subsequently, dbl n-terminal domains, up-stream sequences 
pcr amplified, cloned sequenced. sequences derived sm isolates
were compared analysed.
results: analysis confirmed var family highly diverse natural 
plasmodium falciparum populations. sequence diversity amplified var dbl-1α and
upstream regions showed minimal overlap among isolates, implying var
gene repertoire vast probably indefinite endemic areas. var dbl-1α
sequences isolates diverse singletons found (p<0.05) 
than sm infections. furthermore, var dbl-1α sequences sm
patients rare restricted suggesting certain pfemp1 variants might
induce severe disease.
conclusions: genetic sequence diversity var genes p. falciparum
isolates tanzanian children large relationship disease
severity studied. observed differences suggest different var genes 
might fundamentally different roles host-parasite interaction.
further research required examine clear disease-associations var gene
subsets different geographical settings. importance strict
clinical definitions appropriate large control groups needs emphasized 
for future studies disease associations pfemp1.
