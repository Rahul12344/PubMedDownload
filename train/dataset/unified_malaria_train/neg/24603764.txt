genetic variation mosquito anopheles gambiae profoundly influences its
ability transmit malaria. mosquito gut bacteria shown influence the
outcome infections plasmodium parasites also thought exert a
strong drive genetic variation natural selection; however, link
between antibacterial effects genetic variation yet emerge. here, we
combined snp genotyping expression profiling phenotypic analyses of
candidate genes rnai-mediated silencing 454 pyrosequencing investigate 
this intricate biological system. identified 138 an. gambiae genes be
genetically associated outcome serratia marcescens infection,
including peptidoglycan recognition receptor pgrplc triggers activation 
of antibacterial imd/rel2 pathway epidermal growth factor receptor
egfr. silencing three genes encoding type iii fibronectin domain proteins
(fn3ds) increased serratia load altered gut microbiota composition in
favor enterobacteriaceae. data suggest natural genetic variation in
immune-related genes shape bacterial population structure mosquito
gut high specificity. importantly, fn3d2 encodes homolog the
hypervariable pattern recognition receptor dscam, suggesting that
pathogen-specific recognition may involve broader family immune factors.
additionally, showed silencing gene encoding gustatory receptor
gr9 also associated serratia infection phenotype drastically
increased serratia levels. gr9 antibacterial activity appears related
to mosquito feeding behavior mostly rely changes neuropeptide f
expression, together suggesting behavioral immune response following serratia
infection. findings reveal mosquito response oral serratia
infection comprises epithelial behavioral immune component.
