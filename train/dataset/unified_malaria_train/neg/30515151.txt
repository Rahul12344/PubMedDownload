recently, reported 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (hp-β-cyd), a
common pharmaceutical additive, act vaccine adjuvant enhance
protective type-2 immunogenicity co-administered seasonal influenza split
vaccine inducing host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (damps).
however, like damp-inducing adjuvants aluminum hydroxide
(alum), hp-β-cyd may sufficient induction protective type-1
(cellular) immune responses, thereby leaving room improvement. here, we
demonstrate combination hp-β-cyd humanized tlr9 agonist, k3
cpg-odn, potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (pamp), enhanced the
protective efficacy co-administered influenza split vaccine inducing
antigen-specific type-2 type-1 immune responses, respectively. moreover,
substantial antigen-specific ige induction hp-β-cyd, cause an
allergic response immunized antigen completely suppressed addition 
of k3 cpg-odn. furthermore, hp-β-cyd- k3 cpg-odn-adjuvanted influenza split
vaccination protected mice lethal challenge high doses of
heterologous influenza virus, could protected single
adjuvant vaccines. experiments using gene deficient mice revealed the
unique immunological mechanism action vivo, type-2 type-1 immune 
responses enhanced combined adjuvants dependent tbk1 tlr9,
respectively, indicating parallel signaling pathways. finally, analysis
of immune responses draining lymph node suggested hp-β-cyd promotes
the uptake k3 cpg-odn plasmacytoid dendritic cells b cells, may
contributes activation cells enhanced production igg2c.
taken together, results may offer potential clinical applications for
the combination damp-inducing adjuvant pamp adjuvant improve vaccine
immunogenicity efficacy enhancing type-2 type-1 immune responses 
in parallel manner.
