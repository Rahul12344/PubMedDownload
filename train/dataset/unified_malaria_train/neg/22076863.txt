inclusion affinity tags greatly facilitated process development for
protein antigens, primarily recovery complex mixtures. although
generally viewed supportive product development, affinity tags may have
unintended consequences protein solubility, susceptibility aggregation, and
immunogenicity. merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), erythrocytic stage protein
of plasmodium falciparum candidate malaria vaccine, used evaluate
the impact metal ion affinity-tag protein structure the
induction immunity. end, codon harmonized gene sequences p.
falciparum msp1(42) fvo 3d7 parasites cloned purified and
without histidine (his) tag. report influence his-affinity tags on
protein expression levels, solubility, secondary structure, thermal denaturation,
aggregation impact humoral cellular immune responses mice.
while overall immunogenicity induced his-tagged msp1(42) proteins is
greater, fine specificity humoral cellular immune responses is
altered relative anti-parasitic antibody activity breadth t-cell
responses. thus, usefulness protein tags may outweighed their
potential impact structure function, stressing need caution in
their use. see accompanying commentary randolph doi: 10.1002/biot.201100459.
