we previously developed new malaria vaccine delivery system based the
baculovirus dual expression system (bdes). system, expression malaria 
antigens driven dual promoter consisting baculovirus-derived
polyhedrin mammal-derived cytomegalovirus promoters. test system 
its potential vaccine human malaria parasites, investigated
immune responses newly developed bdes-based plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite protein vaccines (bdes-pfcsp) mice rhesus monkeys.
immunization mice bdes-pfcsp induced th1/th2-mixed type immune responses 
with high pfcsp-specific antibody (ab) titers, provided significant
protection challenge bites mosquitoes infected a
transgenic p. berghei line expressing pfcsp. next, evaluated the
immunogenicity bdes-pfcsp vaccine rhesus monkey model. immunization
of bdes-pfcsp elicited high levels anti-pfcsp ab responses individual
monkeys. moreover, sera immunized monkeys remarkably blocked
sporozoite invasion hepg2 cells. taken together two animal models, our
results indicate novel vaccine platform (bdes) potential clinical
application vaccine malaria.
