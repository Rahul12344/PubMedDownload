the genome sequence human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, was
released almost decade ago. majority plasmodium genome, however,
remains annotated code hypothetical proteins unknown functions. the
introduction forward genetics provided novel means gain better
understanding gene functions associated phenotypes plasmodium.
even certain limitations, technique already shown significant
promise increase understanding parasite biology needed rationalized
drug vaccine design. improvements mutagenesis technique and
the design novel genetic screens lead us exciting discoveries
about critical weaknesses plasmodium, greatly aid development
of new disease intervention strategies.
