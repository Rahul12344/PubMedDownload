ca2+-atpase expression 15 selected isolates malaria patients the
university college hospital (uch) ibadan two cloned strains (w2-chloroquine
resistant, d6-chloroquine sensitive) p.falciparum assessed using
spectrophotometric assay method. kinetics activity ca2+- atpase in
three isolates (ncp 14, ncp5, ncp1) two clones (w2, d6) also assessed. 12%
sds-page analysis total proteins one isolate (ncp14) two clones (w2,
d6) also investigated. selected isolates two cloned strains
exhibited measurable ca2+-atpase activity. ca2+-atpase activity cloned
strain d6 (6.50 + 0.74mmolpi/min/mg protein) higher cloned strain w2 
(3.93 + 0.61mmolpi/min/mg protein. ca2+-atpase activity isolates from
malaria patients varied widely (1.95 + 0.74 - 21.56 +1.43mmolpi/min/mg protein). 
the kinetic constants obtained two cloned strains showed clone w2
had higher vmax (vmax = 363mmolpi/min/mg protein) clone d6 (vmax =
74mmolpi/min/mg protein). isolates two cloned strains showed
similar affinity atp (km ~ 10mm). scan sds-page gel total proteins in
the isolate cloned strains showed presence oligopeptide bands of
molecular weights range 148-176 kda; 116-123 kda respectively. suggest
the presence predicted polypeptide ca2+-atpase nature molecular weight
estimate 139 kda. study agrees previous findings ca2+-atpase 
functionally expressed p.falciparum, study also indicates ca2+-atpase
functional expression may vary isolate clone atp binding
mechanism enzyme similar isolates clones p. falciparum.
the study suggests possible association acquisition of
chloroquine resistance ca2+-atpase functional expression p. falciparum.
