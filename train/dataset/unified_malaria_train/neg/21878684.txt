the darc (duffy antigen/receptor chemokines) gene, also called duffy fy,
encodes membrane-bound chemokine receptor. two malaria parasites, plasmodium
vivax plasmodium knowlesi, use darc trigger internalization red blood
cells. although much reported evolution darc null alleles,
little known evolution coding portion gene the
role protein sequence divergence receptor may play disease
susceptibility zoonosis. here, show plasmodium interaction domain 
of darc nearly invariant human population, suggesting coding
polymorphism unlikely play role differential susceptibility to
infection. however, analysis darc orthologs 35 simian primate species 
reveals high levels sequence divergence plasmodium interaction domain. 
signatures positive selection domain indicate species-specific
mutations protein sequence darc could serve barriers the
transmission plasmodium primate species.
