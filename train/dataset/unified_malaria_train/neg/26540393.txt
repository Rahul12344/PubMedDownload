during development malaria parasite p. falciparum adapt various
different environmental contexts. key cellular mechanisms involving g-protein
coupled signal transduction chains assumed act interfaces.
heterotrimeric g-proteins absent plasmodium. describe first
cloning expression putative, non-canonical ras-like g protein (acronym
pfg) plasmodium. pfg reveals open reading frame 2736 bp encoding a
protein 912 amino acids theoretical pi 8.68 molecular weight
of 108.57 kda. transcript levels expression significantly increased in
the erythrocytic phase particular schizont gametocyte formation.
most notably, pfg gtp binding capacity gtpase activity due enga2
domain present small ras-like gtpases variety bacillus species and
mycobacteria. contrast, plasmodial pfg divergent human
alpha-subunit. pfg expressed e. coli histidine-tagged fusion protein 
and stable 3.5 hours. purification possible native
conditions nickel-chelate chromatography subsequent separation blue
native page. binding fluorescent gtp analogue bodipy® fl guanosine
5'o-(thiotriphosphate) determined fluorescence emission. mastoparan
stimulated gtp binding presence mg2+. gtpase activity determined
colorimetrically. activity expressed absolute fluorescence 50% higher 
the human paralogue activity parasitic enzyme. pfg protein is
expressed erythrocytic stages binds gtp immunoprecipitation.
immunofluorescence using specific antiserum suggests pfg localizes the
parasite cytosol. current data suggest putitative, ras-like
g-protein might involved non-canonical signaling pathway plasmodium.
research function pfg respect pathogenesis antimalarial
chemotherapy currently way.
