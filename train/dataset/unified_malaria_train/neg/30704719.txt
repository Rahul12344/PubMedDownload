4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt) re-recommended world
health organization malaria mosquito control. previous ddt use resulted
in resistance, continued use resistance likely increase terms of
level extent. drosophila melanogaster model dipteran well
annotated genome allowing forward reverse genetic manipulation, numerous
studies done insecticide resistance mechanisms, related malaria
mosquitoes allowing extrapolation. 91-r strain d. melanogaster is
highly resistant ddt (>1500-fold) recently, reduced penetration, increased
detoxification, direct excretion identified resistance
mechanisms. interactions, however, remain unclear. use gal4/uas-rnai
transgenic lines d. melanogaster allowed targeted knockdown genes
putatively involved ddt resistance identified role several
cuticular proteins (cyp4g1 lcp1), cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (cyp6g1 
cyp12d1), atp binding cassette transporters (mdr50, mdr65, mrp1) involved
in decreased sensitivity ddt. findings validated
in 91-r flies using nanoparticle-enhanced rnai strategy, directly implication
these genes ddt resistance 91-r flies.
