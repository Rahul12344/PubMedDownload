post-translational modifications refined, rapidly responsive powerful
ways modulate protein function. among post-translational modifications,
acylation emerging widespread modification exploited eukaryotes,
bacteria viruses control biological processes. protein palmitoylation
involves attachment palmitic acid, also known hexadecanoic acid, to
cysteine residues integral peripheral membrane proteins increases
their affinity membranes. importantly, similar phosphorylation,
palmitoylation reversible becoming recognised instrumental the
regulation protein function modulating protein interactions, stability,
folding, trafficking signalling. palmitoylation appears play central
role biology apicomplexa, regulating critical processes as
host cell invasion vital parasite survival dissemination. the
recent identification 400 palmitoylated proteins plasmodium falciparum
erythrocytic stages illustrates broad spread impact modification 
on parasite biology. main enzymes responsible protein palmitoylation 
multi-membrane protein s-acyl transferases harbouring catalytic asp-his-his-cys
(dhhc) motif. global functional analysis repertoire protein s-acyl
transferases toxoplasma gondii plasmodium berghei recently been
performed. essential nature enzymes illustrates key
roles played post-translational modification corresponding
substrates implicated fundamental processes parasite motility and
organelle biogenesis. toward better understanding depalmitoylation
event, protein palmitoyl protein thioesterase activity identified
in t. gondii. tgppt1/tgash1 main target specific acyl protein
thioesterase inhibitors dispensable parasite survival, suggesting 
implication genes depalmitoylation. palmitoylation/depalmitoylation
cycles emerging potential novel regulatory networks t. gondii
represents superb model organism explore significance.
