even though mitochondrial genomes, characterize eukaryotic cells, were
first discovered 50 years ago, mitochondrial genomics remains an
important topic molecular biology genome sciences. phylum alveolata
comprises three major groups (ciliates, apicomplexans, dinoflagellates), 
mitochondrial genomes diverged widely. even though gene content
of dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes reportedly comparable of
apicomplexans, highly fragmented rearranged genome structures of
dinoflagellates frustrated whole genomic analysis. consequently, noncoding
sequences gene arrangements dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes 
been well characterized. report continuous assembled genome
(∼326 kb) dinoflagellate, symbiodinium minutum, at-rich (∼64.3%) and
that contains three protein-coding genes. based upon silico analysis, the
remaining 99% genome comprises transcriptomic noncoding sequences. rna
edited sites unique, possible start stop codons clarify conserved regions
among dinoflagellates. massive transcriptome analysis shows almost all
regions genome transcribed, including 27 possible fragmented ribosomal
rna genes 12 uncharacterized small rnas similar mitochondrial rna
genes malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum. gene map comparisons show 
that gene order slightly conserved s. minutum p. falciparum. 
however, small rnas intergenic sequences share sequence similarities p. 
falciparum, suggesting function noncoding sequences been
preserved despite development different genome structures.
