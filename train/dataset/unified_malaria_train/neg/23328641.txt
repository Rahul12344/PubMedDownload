malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ma-ards) deadly
complication malaria, pathophysiology insufficiently understood.
both humans murine models, ma-ards characterized marked pulmonary
inflammation. investigated role hemozoin ma-ards c57bl/6 mice
infected plasmodium berghei nk65, p. berghei anka, p. chabaudi as. by
quantifying hemozoin lungs measuring disease parameters of
ma-ards, demonstrated highly significant correlation pulmonary
hemozoin concentrations, lung weights, alveolar edema. histological analysis 
of lungs demonstrated hemozoin localized phagocytes infected
erythrocytes, occasionally granulocytes. species-specific differences
in hemozoin production, measured among individual schizonts, associated
with variations pulmonary pathogenicity. furthermore, pulmonary hemozoin 
and lung pathology correlated number infiltrating inflammatory
cells, increased pulmonary expression cytokines, chemokines, enzymes,
and concentrations alveolar vascular endothelial growth factor. causal
relationship hemozoin inflammation investigated injecting p.
falciparum-derived hemozoin intravenously malaria-free mice. hemozoin
potently induced pulmonary expression proinflammatory chemokines
(interferon-γ inducible protein-10/cxc-chemokine ligand (cxcl)10, monocyte
chemotactic protein-1/cc-chemokine ligand 2, keratinocyte-derived
chemokine/cxcl1), cytokines (il-1β, il-6, il-10, tnf, transforming growth
factor-β), inflammatory mediators (inducible nitric oxide synthase,
heme oxygenase-1, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- oxidase-2, and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1). thus, hemozoin correlates ma-ards and
induces pulmonary inflammation.
