background: artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) first-line
anti-malarial treatment uncomplicated malaria malaria endemic
countries, including tanzania. unfortunately, reports of
artemisinin resistance act failure south east asia highlighting need
to monitor therapeutic efficacy act countries recommended world
health organization.
methods: open-label single arm studies mainland tanzania conducted in
nine sentinel sites 2011, 2012 2015 assess efficacy safety of
artemether/lumefantrine (al) artesunate/amodiaquine (asaq) using 28 days
follow-up dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (dhapq) using 42 days follow-up.
mutations propeller domain plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13)
gene amplification p. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pm2) gene, associated
with artemisinin piperaquine (pq) resistance, also investigated.
results: 428 patients enrolled, 328 patients provided study endpoint. 
al, pcr corrected per-protocol analysis showed adequate clinical and
parasitological response (acpr) 90.3% (n = 28; 95% ci 74.2-98.0) kyela
2012, 95.7% (n = 22; 95% ci 78.1-99.0) chamwino, 100% muheza (n = 29; 95%
ci 88.1-100), 100% nagaga (n = 39; 95% ci 91.0-100) kyela 2015 (n = 60;
95% ci 94.0-100). asaq, pcr corrected acpr 98% (n = 49; 95% ci 89.4-99.9) 
and 100% (n = 25; 95% ci 86.3-100) observed 2011 ujiji kibaha,
respectively. dhapq, acpr 100% (n = 71; 95% ci 94.9-100). 235 
samples genetic interpretable results, 7 (3%) non-synonymous k13
mutations. none candidate validated markers artemisinin
resistance patients carrying alleles cleared parasites day
3. dhapq group, 10% (3/29) samples interpretable results had
pm2 multiple copies none associated treatment failure.
conclusion: tested act mainland tanzania highly efficacious and
none validated k13 mutants associated artemisinin resistance was
observed. however, three isolates multiple copy numbers pm2 gene
associated pq resistance among limited samples tested successfully calls
for investigation. trial registration number actrn12615000159550.
