the biogeographic histories parasites pathogens infrequently compared 
with free-living species, including hosts. documenting the
frequency parasites pathogens disperse across geographic regions
contributes understanding evolution, also likelihood
that may become emerging infectious diseases. haemosporidian parasites of
birds (parasite genera plasmodium, haemoproteus leucocytozoon) globally
distributed, dipteran-vectored parasites. date, 2000 avian haemosporidian
lineages designated molecular barcoding methods. achieve their
current distributions, lineages must dispersed long distances, often
over water. quantify events using global avian haemosporidian
database malavi additional records primarily americas. scored
lineages belonging one global biogeographic regions based on
infection records. lineages restricted single region were
globally distributed. also used part cytochrome b gene create
genus-level parasite phylogenies scored well-supported nodes having
descendant lineages regional sympatry allopatry. descendant sister lineages
of plasmodium, haemoproteus leucocytozoon distributed allopatry in
11, 16 15% investigated nodes, respectively. although small but
significant fraction molecular variance cytochrome b three
genera could explained biogeographic region, global parasite dispersal
likely contributed majority unexplained variance. results
suggest avian haemosporidian parasites faced geographic barriers to
dispersal evolutionary history.
