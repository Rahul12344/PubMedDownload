plasmodium falciparum displays large remarkable variety heat shock
protein 40 family members (pfhsp40s). majority pfhsp40s poorly
characterized, although functions suggested,
their exact mechanism action still elusive interacting partners
and client proteins unknown. p. falciparum heat shock protein 70 family
members (pfhsp70s) extensively characterized pfhsp40s,
with certain members shown function molecular chaperones. however, little
is known pfhsp70-pfhsp40 chaperone partnerships. mounting
evidence chaperones important protein homoeostasis and
cytoprotection, also protein trafficking across parasitophorous
vacuole (pv) infected erythrocyte. propose certain members
of chaperone families work together maintain exported proteins an
unfolded state reach final destination. review, we
critically evaluate known known pfhsp40s pfhsp70s.
