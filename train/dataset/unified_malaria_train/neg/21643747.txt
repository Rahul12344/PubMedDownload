regulation gene expression malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum is
tightly controlled little known many steps involved. one step
i.e. translation initiation also poorly understood p. falciparum,
choice translation initiation site (tis) critical decision largely
due high frequency augs relatively long 5' untranslated regions 
of parasite mrnas. sequences surrounding tis major role play in
translation initiation report evaluates sequences mutational
analysis heat shock protein 86 gene, transient transfection reporter
assays parasite. find purines -3 +4 positions are
essential efficient translation p. falciparum, similar other
eukaryotes. interestingly, u -1 position results 2.5-fold higher
reporter activity compared wild type. certain classes protein biosynthetic 
genes show higher frequencies u -1 position, suggesting these
genes may exhibit higher levels translation. work defines optimal
sequences tis choice implications design efficient
expression vectors important human pathogen.
