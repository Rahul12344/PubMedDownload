background: incidences resistance current drugs plasmodium is
increasing, hence, necessary investigate explore new drug targets to
combat malarial disease.
objective: analysis transcriptome sequence information characterize hub
genes nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) derive 
therapeutic objectives plasmodium falciparum.
materials methods: differentially expressed genes ring other
stages p. falciparum identified using cufflinks tool. using david and
kaas programs, gene ontology pathway analysis performed. the
networks protein-protein interaction (ppi) developed search tool for
the retrieval interacting genes/proteins cytoscape, node degree in
the network calculated using network analyzer, mcode plugins of
cytoscape. sift, provean, predictsnp programs used study genetic 
variations, affect protein functions.
results: list 4196 nonredundant genes used functional annotation
cluster analysis, 8 significant hub genes picked ppi
network using mcode plugins cytoscape. various nssnps identified these
8 hub genes investigated native mutant stage for
solvent accessibility alteration secondary structure protein residues.
conclusion: hub genes identified study serve potential targets to
develop therapy suppress pathogenic action p. falciprum through
experimental techniques.
