fertilization. recently produced carboxy-terminal 10c-fragment of
pfs48/45 containing three known epitopes tb antibodies chimera 
n-terminal region glurp (r0). resulting fusion protein elicited high titer
tb antibodies rodents. increase relatively low yield correctly
folded pfs48/45 generated series novel chimera truncating the
10c-fragments 6 cysteine residues containing sub-units (6c). constructs
harbor major epitope tb antibodies. one sub-units (r0.6cc),
produced high yields correctly folded conformers, could purified a
simple 2-step procedure. purified r0.6cc stable elicits high titer tb
antibodies rats. yield, purity stability r0.6cc allows 
clinical development.
