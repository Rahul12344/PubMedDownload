attenuated poxviruses currently development vaccine vectors 
a number diseases including, influenza, hiv, malaria tuberculosis.
modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) attenuated, replication deficient
vaccinia virus (vacv) strain which, similar replication competent vacv, is
highly immunogenic. lack productive viral replication improves the
safety profile mva vector, minimizing potential reversion to
virulent forms particularly used immunocompromised individuals. despite its
inability replicate mammalian cells, mva still efficiently expresses
viral recombinant genes making potent antigen delivery platform.
moreover, due loss various immunomodulatory factors mva infection leads
to rapid local immune responses, fulfilling requirement adjuvant. this
review take look immunostimulatory properties mva, paying
particular attention signalling innate immune system response to
mva vacv infection. understanding cellular molecular mechanisms
modulated vacv help future design engineering new vaccines 
and may provide insight previously unknown mechanisms dominant virus-host
interactions.
