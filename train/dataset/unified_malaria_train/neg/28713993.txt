liver ischemia reperfusion (i/r) injury primary concern cases of
liver disease worldwide associated hemorrhagic shock, resection and
transplantation. numerous studies previously conducted investigate
the underlying mechanisms liver i/r injury, however yet been
fully elucidated. determine difference ischemia reperfusion in
signaling pathways relative pathological mechanisms, present study
downloaded microarray data gse10657 gene expression omnibus database. 
total two data groups 1‑year‑old mice selected analysis:
i) a total 90 min ischemia; ii) 90 min ischemia followed 1 h of
reperfusion, n=3 group. limma package first used identify the
differentially expressed genes (degs). degs subsequently uploaded the
database annotation visualization integrated discovery online tool for
functional enrichment analysis. protein‑protein interaction (ppi) network was
then constructed via string version 10.0 analyzed using cytoscape software. a
total 114 degs identified, including 21 down 93 upregulated genes.
these degs primarily enriched malaria influenza a, addition the
tumor necrosis factor mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathways.
hub genes identified ppi network c‑x‑c motif chemokine ligand (cxcl) 
1, c‑c motif chemokine ligand (ccl) 2, interleukin 6, jun proto‑oncogene,
activator protein (ap)‑1 transcription factor subunit, fos proto‑oncogene, ap‑1
transcription factor subunit dual specificity phosphatase 1. cxcl1 ccl2
may exhibit important roles liver i/r injury, involvement immune
and inflammatory responses chemokine‑mediated signaling pathway,
particularly reperfusion stage. however, experiments elucidate 
the specific roles mediators required future.
