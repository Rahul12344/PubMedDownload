people living endemic areas often habour several malaria infections once.
high-resolution genotyping distinguish infections detecting the
presence different alleles polymorphic locus. however number of
infections may accurately counted since parasites multiple infections
may carry allele. use simulation determine circumstances under
which number observed genotypes likely substantially less than
the number infections present investigate performance two methods
for estimating numbers infections high-resolution genotyping data.
the simulations suggest problem substantial datasets: the
disparity mean numbers infections observed genotypes was
small 20 alleles, 20 blood samples, mean number 
of infections 6 less frequency common allele 
no greater 20%. issue multiple infections carrying allele is
unlikely major component errors pcr-based genotyping.
simulations also showed that, heterogeneity allele frequencies, the
observed frequencies good approximation true allele frequencies.
the first method proposed estimate numbers infections assumes
that good approximation hence poorly presence of
heterogeneity. contrast, second method li et al estimates the
numbers infections true allele frequencies simultaneously produced
accurate estimates mean number infections.
