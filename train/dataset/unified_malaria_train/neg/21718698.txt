malaria parasites genus plasmodium classified primarily the
basis differences morphology. single-celled organisms often lack
distinguishing morphological features, encumber species
delimitation identification. six saurian malaria parasites been
described caribbean island hispaniola. six infect lizards 
genus anolis, two parasites distinguished using
morphology. remaining four species overlap morphology geography, and
cannot consistently identified using traditional methods. compared a
morphological approach molecular phylogenetic approach assessing the
taxonomy parasites. surveyed blood parasites 677 anolis
lizards, representing 26 anolis spp. total 52 sites across hispaniola. 
fifty-five lizards infected plasmodium spp., representing
several new host records, 24 infections could matched to
previously described species using traditional morphological criteria. then
estimated phylogeny parasites using mitochondrial (cytb and
coxi) nuclear (ef2) genes, included carefully selected genbank sequences 
to confirm identities certain species. molecular results unambiguously
corroborated morphology-based species identifications two
species previously judged morphologically distinctive. remaining
infections fell two well-supported reciprocally monophyletic clades,
which contained morphological variation previously reported four of
the morphologically ambiguous species. one clades identified as
plasmodium floridense plasmodium fairchildi hispaniolae. we
elevate latter plasmodium hispaniolae comb. nov. is
polyphyletic mainland species plasmodium fairchildifairchildi we
contribute additional morphological molecular characters future species
delimitation. phylogenetic hypotheses indicate two currently recognised 
taxa, plasmodium minasense anolisi plasmodium tropiduri caribbense, not
valid hispaniola. results illustrate molecular data improve
taxonomic hypotheses plasmodium reliable morphological characters are
lacking.
