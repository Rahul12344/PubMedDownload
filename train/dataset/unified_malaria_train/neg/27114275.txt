artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum, agent severe malaria, 
currently major obstacle malaria control southeast asia. gene named
"kelch13" associated artemisinin resistance p. falciparum the
orthologue kelch gene p. vivax identified small number of
mutations found previous studies. kelch orthologues two 
human malaria parasites, p. malariae p. ovale, yet studied.
therefore, study, orthologous kelch genes p. malariae, p. ovale
wallikeri, p. ovale curtisi isolated analyzed first time.
the homologies kelch genes p. malariae p. ovale 84.8% and
82.7%, respectively, compared gene p. falciparum kelch polymorphisms
were studied 13 p. malariae 5 p. ovale isolates thailand. 
2 nonsynonymous mutations found samples. one mutation p533l, which
was found 1 13 p. malariae isolates, k137r, found 1
isolate p. ovale wallikeri (n = 4). result needs considered 
context widespread artemisinin used within region; functional
consequences artemisinin sensitivity p. malariae p. ovale need to
be elucidated.
