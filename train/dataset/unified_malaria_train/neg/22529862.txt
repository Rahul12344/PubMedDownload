evidence indicates cysteine proteases play essential role malaria
parasites; therefore obvious area investigation inhibition 
enzymes treat malaria. studies cysteine protease inhibitors and
manipulating cysteine proteases genes suggested role cysteine
proteases hemoglobin hydrolysis. best characterized plasmodium cysteine
proteases falcipains, papain family enzymes. falcipain-2 and
falcipain-3 major hemoglobinases p. falciparum. structural functional 
analysis falcipains showed unique domains including refolding
domain hemoglobin binding domain. overall, complexes falcipain-2 and
falcipain-3 small macromolecular inhibitors provide structural insight
to facilitate design modification effective drug treatment against
malaria. drug development targeting falcipains aided strong
foundation biochemical structural studies.
