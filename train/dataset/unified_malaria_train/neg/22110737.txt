the host immune response contributes onset progression severe
malaria syndromes, cerebral malaria. adjunctive immunomodulatory
strategies severe malaria may improve clinical outcome beyond achievable
with artemisinin-based therapy alone. here, report prophylaxis with
inhaled nitric oxide significantly reduced systemic inflammation (lower tnf, ifnγ
and mcp-1 peripheral blood) endothelial activation (decreased sicam-1 
vwf, increased angiopoeitin-1 levels peripheral blood) experimental 
cerebral malaria model. mice received inhaled nitric oxide starting prior to
infection reduced parasitized erythrocyte accumulation brain,
decreased brain expression icam-1, preserved vascular integrity compared
to control mice.inhaled nitric oxide administered combination artesunate,
starting late 5.5 days post-infection, improved survival treatment
with artesunate alone (70% survival artesunate vs. 100% survival in
the artesunate plus ino group, p = 0.03). data support clinical
investigation inhaled nitric oxide novel adjunctive therapy patients
with severe malaria.
