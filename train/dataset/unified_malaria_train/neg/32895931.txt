structural variation human genome affect risk disease. example
is complex structural variant human glycophorin gene cluster, called
dup4, associated clinically significant level protection
against severe malaria. human glycophorin gene cluster harbours least 23
distinct structural variants, accurate genotyping complex structural 
variation remains challenge. here, use polymerase chain reaction-based
strategy genotype structural variation human glycophorin gene cluster, 
including alleles responsible u- blood group. validate our
approach, based triplex paralogue ratio test, publically available
samples 1000 genomes project. genotype 574 individuals a
longitudinal birth cohort (tori-bossito cohort) using small amounts dna low
cost. approach readily identifies known deletions duplications, can
potentially identify novel variants analysis. allow
exploration genetic variation glycophorin locus, investigation of
its relationship malaria, large sample sets minimal cost, using
standard molecular biology equipment.
