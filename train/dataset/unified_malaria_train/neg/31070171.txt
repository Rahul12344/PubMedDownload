background & objectives: submicroscopic malaria infections low parasite
density serve silent reservoir maintaining residual transmission 
population. infections identified targeted eliminated
for sustained malaria control. conventional methods diagnosis as
light microscopy rapid diagnostic kits often fail detect low density
infections. therefore, sensitive molecular techniques employed
to detect low density infections. objectives study explore 
prevalence sub-microscopic infections low transmission areas punjab
using highly sensitive molecular tool.
methods: total 1114 finger prick blood samples collected active
surveillance tested malaria diagnosis using light microscopy, rdt and
pcr. nested pcr amplification performed using pair plasmodium
genus-specific primers 18s rrna small subunit gene (18s rrna). the
amplified pcr products analysed using 2% agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide observed transilluminator.
results: test positive rate (tpr) microscopy, rdt pcr 4.4, 3.95 and
5.75%, respectively. microscopy rdt failed detect mixed infections whereas
0.26% cases found mixed infection pcr. compared lm rdt, pcr 
has detected 1.3% additional positive cases. however, total positive cases
detected pcr, 23.4% infections found submicroscopic, could
not detected conventional methods diagnosis.
interpretation & conclusions: molecular study revealed existence of
submicroscopic malaria cases study population would remained
undetected conventional methods diagnosis. particularly important
because punjab state malaria elimination phase targeted achieve
elimination 2021. however, undetected parasite positive cases may pose
bigger problem time due continued transmission. therefore, application 
more sensitive diagnostic tools like pcr lamp conventional methods may
be much useful case detection particularly low transmission settings
for malaria elimination.
