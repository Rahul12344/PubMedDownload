the malaria parasite's complex journey anopheles mosquito vector
provides multiple opportunities targeting plasmodium recombinant
effectors different developmental stages different host tissues. have
designed expressed transgenes efficiently suppress plasmodium infection 
by targeting parasite multiple independent endogenous exogenous
effectors multiple infection stages potentiate suppression minimize the
probability development resistance develop. also addressed 
fitness impact transgene expression mosquito. show highly
potent suppression achieved targeting pre-oocyst stages by
transgenically overexpressing either endogenous immune deficiency immune
pathway transcription factor rel2 polycistronic mrna encoding multiple
antiparasitic effectors simultaneously targeting sporozoite stages with
an anti-sporozoite single-chain antibody fused antiparasitic protein
scorpine. expression selected endogenous effector systems appears pose 
a lower fitness cost use foreign genes.
