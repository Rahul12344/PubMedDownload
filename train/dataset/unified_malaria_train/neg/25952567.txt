in myanmar, civil unrest establishment internally displaced persons (idp) 
settlement along myanmar-china border impacted malaria transmission. the
growing idp populations raise deep concerns health impact local
communities. microsatellite markers used examine source spreading
patterns plasmodium falciparum idp settlement surrounding villages
in myanmar along china border. genotypic structure p. falciparum was
compared past three years area demographic history
was inferred determine source recent infections. addition, we
examined border migration factor p. falciparum infections china 
determining gene flow patterns across borders. compared local community, the
idp samples showed reduced consistently lower genetic diversity the
past three years. strong signature genetic bottleneck detected the
idp samples. p. falciparum infections border regions china were
genetically similar myanmar parasite gene flow constrained by
geographical distance. reduced genetic diversity p. falciparum suggested
intense malaria control within idp settlement. human movement key
factor spread malaria locally myanmar across the
international border.
