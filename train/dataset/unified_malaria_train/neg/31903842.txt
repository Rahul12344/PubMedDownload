the continuous emergence resistance available drugs poses major
constraints development effective therapeutics malaria. malaria
drug resistance attributed manifestation numerous factors. 
for example, mutations parasite transporter protein acetyl-coa transporter
(pfact) remarkably affect uptake affinity drug molecule against
malaria, hence enhance susceptibility resistance. identify major
contributors loss functionality, thoroughly scrutinized eight
such recently reported resistant mutants, via in-silico tools terms of
alterations different properties. performed molecular dynamics simulations 
of selected pfact mutants gain deeper insights structural
perturbation dynamicity. comparison residue interaction network map of
mutants wild type (wt) protein suggests structural changes a
result mutation(s) translate weakening intra-protein
interactions, especially around drug binding pocket. this, turn,
diminishes affinity drug molecules towards binding site, was
validated docking analysis. finally, collating observations, have
delineated r108k mutant deviate wt protein, which, intriguingly 
suggests replacing amino acid another similar nature even
translate greater functional effects dissimilar
substitutions.communicated ramaswamy h. sarma.
