the plasmodium vivax reticulocyte-binding protein (rbp) family identified
based annotation adhesive ligands p. vivax genome.
reticulocyte-specific interactions pvrbps (pvrbp1 pvrbp2) were
previously reported. plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue
4 (pfrh4, homologue pvrbp1) observed possess erythrocyte-binding
activity via complement receptor 1 erythrocyte surface. however, the
reticulocyte-binding mechanisms p. vivax unclear large
molecular mass pvrbp1 (>326 kda) difficulty associated vitro
cultivation. present study, 34 kda pvrbp1a (plasmodb id: pvx_098585)
and 32 kda pvrbp1b (pvx_098582) selected 30 kda fragment pfrh4 
for reticulocyte-specific binding activity analysis. pvrbp1a pvrbp1b
were found localized microneme mature schizont-stage
parasites. naturally acquired immune responses pvrbp1a-34 pvrbp1b-32 
were observed lower pvdbp-rii. reticulocyte-specific binding activities 
of pvrbp1a-34 pvrbp1b-32 significantly higher normocyte binding
activity significantly reduced chymotrypsin treatment. pvrbp1a and
1b, bind reticulocytes suggests ligands may an
important role p. vivax merozoite invasion.
