chlorotonil novel polyketide isolated myxobacterium sorangium
cellulosum ce1525 features unique gem-dichloro-1,3-dione moiety. it
exhibits potent bioactivity, notably problematic malaria
pathogen plasmodium falciparum nanomolar range. addition, strong
antibacterial moderate antifungal activity determined. outstanding
biological activity chlorotonil well unusual chemical structure
triggered interest elucidating biosynthesis, prerequisite for
alteration scaffold synthetic biology approaches. endeavor was
facilitated recent report describing strikingly similar structure of
anthracimycin marine streptomycete, compound considerable interest
due potent antibacterial activity. study, report the
identification characterization chlorotonil biosynthetic gene
cluster ce1525 compare anthracimycin biosynthesis.
access gene clusters allowed us highlight commonalities the
two pathways revealed striking differences, plausibly
explain structural differences observed intriguing natural
products.
