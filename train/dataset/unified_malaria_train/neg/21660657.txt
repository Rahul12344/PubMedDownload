a number cysteine proteases malaria parasites described many 
more suggested analysis plasmodium falciparum genome sequence. 
best characterized proteases falcipains, family four
papain-family enzymes. falcipain-2 falcipain-3 act concert other
proteases hydrolyze host erythrocyte hemoglobin parasite food vacuole. 
disruption falcipain-2 gene led transient block hemoglobin
hydrolysis parasites increased sensitivity protease inhibitors.
disruption falcipain-3 gene possible, strongly suggesting that
this protease essential erythrocytic parasites. disruption the
falcipain-1 gene alter development erythrocytes, led decreased 
production oocysts mosquitoes. papain-family proteases predicted by
the genome sequence include dipeptidyl peptidases, calpain homolog and
serine-repeat antigens (seras). dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 appears be
essential localized food vacuole, suggesting role hemoglobin
hydrolysis. dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 appears play role rupture 
erythrocytes mature parasites. p. falciparum calpain homolog gene could
not disrupted, suggesting protein essential role the
parasite cell cycle suggested. nine p. falciparum seras cysteine
protease motifs, active site cys replaced ser. gene
disruption studies suggested sera-5 sera-6 essential. activation 
sera-5 serine protease seems required merozoite egress the
erythrocyte. new drugs malaria greatly needed cysteine proteases
represent potential drug targets. cysteine protease inhibitors demonstrated 
potent antimalarial effects optimization testing falcipain
inhibitor antimalarials underway.
