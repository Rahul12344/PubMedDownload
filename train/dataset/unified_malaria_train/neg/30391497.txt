sporozoites infective form malaria parasites transmitted
from mosquito salivary glands new host mosquito blood meal. the
sporozoites develop inside sporogonic oocyst crucial the
continuation life cycle oocyst ruptures release sporozoites.
we recently described two plasmodium oocyst rupture proteins (orp1 orp2),
localized oocyst capsule, essential rupture the
oocysts. orps contain histone fold domain implicated mechanism of
oocyst rupture, possibly formation heterodimer two
histone fold domains. gain understanding function different
regions orp2 protein, generated deletion mutants. monitored oocyst
formation rupture well sporozoites salivary gland. results
show different regions orp2 play independent roles sporozoite egress. 
deleting n-terminal histone fold domain orp2 blocked sporozoite egress
from oocyst. progressive deletions c-terminal resulted or
significantly impaired sporozoite egress.
