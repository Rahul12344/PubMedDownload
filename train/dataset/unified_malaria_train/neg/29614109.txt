the malaria-causing blood stage plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular
pantothenate proliferation. parasite converts pantothenate coenzyme 
a (coa) via five enzymes, first pantothenate kinase (pfpank).
multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and
cj-15,801, kill parasite targeting coa biosynthesis/utilisation. their
mechanism action, however, remains unknown. here, show parasites
pressured pantothenol cj-15,801 become resistant analogues.
whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations one two putative pank genes
(pfpank1) resistant line. mutations significantly alter pfpank
activity, two conferring fitness cost, consistent pfpank1 coding 
a functional pank essential normal growth. mutants exhibit a
different sensitivity profile recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial
pantothenate analogues, one line hypersensitive. provide evidence
consistent different pantothenate analogue classes different
mechanisms action: inhibit coa biosynthesis others inhibit
coa-utilising enzymes.
