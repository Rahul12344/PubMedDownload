insects act vectors diseases plants, animals, humans. replacement
of wild insect populations genetically modified individuals unable to
transmit disease provides potentially self-perpetuating method disease
prevention. population replacement requires gene drive mechanism order to
spread linked genes mediating disease refractoriness wild populations. we
previously reported creation synthetic medea selfish genetic elements able
to drive population replacement drosophila. elements use
microrna-mediated silencing myd88, maternally expressed gene required for
embryonic dorso-ventral pattern formation, coupled early zygotic expression 
of rescuing transgene, bring gene drive. medea elements work
through additional mechanisms needed order able carry cycles 
of population replacement and/or remove existing transgenes population, 
using second-generation elements spread driving first-generation
elements population. report synthesis population
genetic behavior two new synthetic medea elements drive population
replacement manipulation signaling pathways involved cellular
blastoderm formation notch signaling, demonstrating drosophila medea
elements generated manipulation diverse signaling pathways. 
also describe mrna small rna changes ovaries early embryos
associated medea-bearing females. finally, use modeling illustrate how
medea elements carrying genes result diapause-dependent female lethality 
could used bring population suppression.
