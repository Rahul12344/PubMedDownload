loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) used detect several
pathogens including malaria parasites field clinical samples. this
protocol, malaria lamp technology developed differentiate between
plasmodium falciparum (pf) plasmodium vivax (pv) species targeting the
dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) gene, known target for
the antifolate class drugs pyrimethamine. lamp primer sets are
designed validated species specific amplification. additionally, specific
probes help improve detection visualization products combined
with lateral flow dipstick-based (lfd) detection. protocols further
simplified eliminate tedious sample preparation steps, crude lysis
prepared simply diluting microliter (Î¼l) blood sample distilled
water sufficient. lamp-lfd malaria dhfr-ts protocols sensitive can
detect little 1 picogram (pg) pfdna 1 nanogram (ng) pvdna, a
few microliters crude lysate infected blood samples (yongkiettrakul et
al., parasitol int 63: 777-784, 2014). simplified steps reduce
cost also increase potential large application fields and
clinical settings.
