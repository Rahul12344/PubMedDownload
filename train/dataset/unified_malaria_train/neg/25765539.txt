ixodes ricinus tick transmits pathogens lyme several
arboviral diseases. pathogens invade tick midgut, disseminate the
hemolymph, transmitted vertebrate host via salivary glands;
subverting processes could used interrupt pathogen transfer. here, we
use massive de novo sequencing characterize transcriptional dynamics of
the salivary midgut tissues nymphal adult i. ricinus various time
points attachment vertebrate host. members number gene
families show stage- time-specific expression. hypothesize gene
expression switching may epigenetic control and, support this,
identify 34 candidate proteins modify histones. i. ricinus-secreted proteins
are encoded genes non-synonymous synonymous mutation rate even 
greater immune-related genes. midgut transcriptome (mialome) analysis
reveals several enzymes associated protein, carbohydrate, lipid
digestion, transporters channels might associated nutrient
uptake, immune-related transcripts including antimicrobial peptides. this
publicly available dataset supports identification protein gene
targets biochemical physiological studies exploit transmission
