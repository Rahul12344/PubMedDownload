background: aedes aegypti important global vector dengue virus
infection humans. availability draft genome sequence mosquito
provides unique opportunities study different aspects biology,
including identification genes pathways relevant developmental
processes associated transition across individual life stages. however,
detailed knowledge gene expression patterns pertaining developmental stages
of a. aegypti largely lacking.
results: performed custom cdna microarray analyses examine expression
patterns among six developmental stages: early larvae, late larvae, early pupae, 
late pupae, adult male female mosquitoes. results revealed 1,551
differentially expressed transcripts (dets) showing significant differences in
levels expression life stages. data suggests of
the differential expression occurs stage specific manner a. aegypti.
based hierarchical clustering expression levels, correlated expression
patterns dets also observed among developmental stages. weighted gene
correlation network analysis revealed modular patterns expression among the
dets. observed hydrolase activity, membrane, integral membrane, dna
binding, translation, ribosome, nucleoside-triphosphatase activity, structural
constituent ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex receptor activity were
among top ten ranked go (gene ontology) terms associated dets.
significant associations dets also observed specific kegg (kyoto
encyclopedia genes genomes) pathway modules. finally, comparisons the
previously reported developmental transcriptome malaria vector, anopheles 
gambiae, indicated gene expression patterns developmental processes
reflect species-specific well common components two mosquito
species.
conclusions: study shows genes involved developmental life cycle 
of a. aegypti expressed highly stage-specific manner. suggests that
transcriptional events associated transition larval, pupal adult
stages largely discrete.
