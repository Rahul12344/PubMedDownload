background: plasmodium vivax widely distributed human malaria
parasite accounts approximately number malaria cases as
plasmodium falciparum india. compared p. falciparum, p. vivax is
difficult eradicate tendency cause relapses, impacts
treatment control strategies. genetic diversity parasites,
particularly merozoite surface protein-3 alpha (msp-3α) gene, used 
to help develop potential vaccine. present study aimed investigate the
genetic diversity p. vivax using highly polymorphic antigen gene msp-3α
and assess suitability using gene population genetic studies
of p. vivax isolates carried 2004-06. recent study been
reported msp 3α recent decade india. limited reports available 
on genetic diversity p. vivax population india; hence, report 
aimed improve understanding molecular epidemiology parasite 
by studying p. vivax msp-3α (pvmsp-3α) marker p. vivax field isolates
from india.
methods: field isolates collected different sites distributed across
eight states india. total 182 blood samples analysed nested
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp)
technique using hhai alui restriction enzymes determine genetic msp-3α
variation among clinical p. vivax isolates.
results: based length variants pcr products pvmsp-3α gene, three
allele sizes, type (1.8 kb), type b (1.5 kb) type c (1.2 kb) detected 
among 182 samples. type pcr amplicon predominant (75.4 %) the
samples compared type b (14.3 %) type c (10.0 %) polymorphisms.
among samples analysed, 8.2 % mixed infections detected pcr
alone. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis involving the
restriction enzymes alui hhai generated fragment sizes highly
polymorphic revealed substantial diversity nucleotide level.
conclusions: present study first extensive study india using the
pvmsp-3α marker. results indicated pvmps-3α, polymorphic genetic
marker p. vivax, exhibited considerable variability infection prevalence in
field isolates india. additionally, mean multiplicity infection
observed study sites indicated p. vivax highly diverse in
nature india, pvmsp-3α likely effective promising
epidemiological marker.
