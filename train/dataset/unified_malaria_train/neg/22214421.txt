background: toxoplasmosis widespread zoonotic parasitic disease occurs 
in animals humans. traditional molecular assays often difficult to
perform, especially early diagnosis toxoplasma gondii infections.
here, established novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification targeting the
529 bp repeat element (529 bp-lamp) detect t. gondii dna blood samples of
experimental mice infected tachyzoites rh strain.
findings: assay performed bst dna polymerase 65Â°c 1 h. the
detection limit 529 bp-lamp assay low 0.6 fg t. gondii dna.
the sensitivity assay 100 1000 fold higher lamp 
targeting b1 gene (b1-lamp) nested pcr targeting 529 bp repeat element (529
bp-nested pcr), respectively. specificity 529 bp-lamp assay was
determined using dna samples trypanosoma evansi, plasmodium falciparum,
paragonimus westermani, schistosoma japonicum, fasciola hepatica and
angiostrongylus cantonensis. cross-reactivity dna parasites
was found. assay able detect t. gondii dna mouse blood samples 
at one day post infection (dpi).
conclusions: report following findings: (i) detection limit 529
bp-lamp assay 0.6 fg t. gondii dna; (ii) assay involve any
cross-reactivity dna parasites; (iii) first report 
on application lamp assay early diagnosis toxoplasmosis in
blood samples experimentally infected mice. due simplicity,
sensitivity cost-effectiveness common use, suggest assay
should used early diagnostic tool health control toxoplasmosis.
