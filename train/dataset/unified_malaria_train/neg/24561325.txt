background: fungal biopesticides great interest vector control
scientists provide novel environmentally friendly alternative to
insecticide use. aim study determine whether genes associated 
with pyrethroid resistance anopheles arabiensis sudan south africa
are induced following exposure entomopathogenic fungus, beauveria 
bassiana (strain gha).
methods: following b. bassiana bioassays, rna extracted infected
mosquitoes transcription four important insecticide resistance genes, 
cyp9l1, cyp6m2 cyp4g16 (cytochrome p450s) tpx4 (thioredoxin peroxidase)
was investigated using quantitative real-time pcr.
results: beauveria bassiana strain gha highly infective virulent 
an. arabiensis. terms changes gene transcription, overall, fold
change (fc) values gene infected strains, lower 1.5.
the fc values cyp9l1, cyp6m2 tpx4, significantly lower fc
values genes uninfected resistant an. arabiensis.
conclusion: data suggest b. bassiana enhance pyrethroid
resistant phenotype molecular level two an. arabiensis strains used
here, different pyrethroid resistance mechanisms, revealed increase in
pre-existing metabolic transcripts. supports fact fungal pathogens 
are suitable candidates vector control, particularly regard the
development novel vector control strategies.
