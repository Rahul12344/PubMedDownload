malaria one important infectious diseases world, has
many economic social impacts populations, especially poor countries.
transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) valuable tools malaria eradication.
a study anopheles gambiae revealed polyclonal antibodies to
carboxypeptidase b1 a. gambiae block sexual parasite development the
mosquito midgut. hence, introduced tbv target regions a.
gambiae main malaria vector. however, iran neighboring countries as
far china, main malaria vector anopheles stephensi. also, genome of
this organism sequenced yet. therefore, study,
carboxypeptidase b1 a. stephensi characterized genomic proteomic
approaches. furthermore, expression pattern ingestion plasmodium
falciparum gametocytes effect anti-cpbas1 antibodies sexual
parasite development evaluated. results revealed cpbas1
expression level increased ingestion mature gametocytes p.
falciparum anti-cpbas1 directed antibodies could significantly reduce
the mosquito infection rate test group compared control group.
therefore, according findings respect high similarity of
carboxypeptidase enzymes two main malaria vectors africa (a.
gambiae) asia (a. stephensi) presence sympatric vectors,
cpbas1 could introduced tbv candidate regions a. stephensi is
the main malaria vector, broaden scope potential wider 
application cpbas1 antigen homologs/orthologs.
