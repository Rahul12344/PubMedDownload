background: antifolates currently clinical use malaria preventive
therapy treatment. drugs kill parasites targeting enzymes in
the de novo folate pathway. use antifolates limited the
spread drug-resistant mutations. gtp cyclohydrolase (gch1) first 
the rate-limiting enzyme folate pathway. amplification gch1
gene found certain plasmodium falciparum isolates cause antifolate
resistance influence course antifolate resistance evolution. these
findings showed importance p. falciparum gch1 drug resistance
intervention. however, little known p. falciparum gch1 terms of
kinetic parameters functional assays, precluding opportunity obtain
the key information catalytic reaction eventually develop this
enzyme drug target.
methods: plasmodium falciparum gch1 cloned expressed bacteria.
enzymatic activity determined measurement fluorescent converted
neopterin assay validation using mutant gtp analogue. genetic
complementation study performed ∆fole bacteria functionally identify
the residues domains p. falciparum gch1 required enzymatic
activity. plasmodial gch1 sequences aligned structurally modeled to
reveal conserved catalytic residues.
results: kinetic parameters optimal conditions enzymatic reactions were
determined fluorescence-based assay. inhibitor test p.
falciparum gch1 possible indicated inhibitory effect by
8-oxo-gtp. genetic complementation proven convenient method study 
the function p. falciparum gch1. series domain truncations revealed 
the conserved core domain gch1 responsible enzymatic activity.
homology modelling fits p. falciparum gch1 classic tunnelling-fold
structure well-conserved catalytic residues active site.
conclusions: functional assays p. falciparum gch1 based enzymatic activity
and genetic complementation successfully developed. assays in
combination homology model characterized enzymatic activity p.
falciparum gch1 importance key amino acid residues. potential 
to use assay inhibitor screening validated 8-oxo-gtp, known gtp 
analogue inhibitor.
