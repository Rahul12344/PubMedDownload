background: chloroquine, previous highly efficacious, easy use and
affordable anti-malarial agent withdrawn malaria endemic regions due 
high levels resistance. review collated evidence published-reviewed 
articles establish prevalence pfcrt 76t pfmdr-1 86y alleles malaria 
affected countries following official discontinuation chloroquine use.
methods: review protocol developed, registered prospero
(#crd42018083957) published peer-reviewed journal. article search was
done pubmed, scopus, lilacs/vhl embase databases two experienced
librarians (ak, rs) period 1990-to-febuary 2018. mesh terms boolean
operators (and, or) used. data extraction form designed excel spread 
sheet 2007. data extraction done three reviewers (nl, bb mo),
discrepancies resolved discussion. random effects analysis done in
open meta analyst software. heterogeneity established using i2-statistic.
results: total 4721 citations retrieved article search
(pubmed = 361, lilac/vhl = 28, science direct = 944, scopus = 3388). additional
targeted search resulted three (03) eligible articles. removal of
duplicates (n = 523) screening, 38 articles included final
review. average genotyping success rate 63.6% (18,343/28,820) pfcrt k76t 
and 93.5% (16,232/17,365) pfmdr-1 86y mutations. prevalence pfcrt 76t 
as follows; east africa 48.9% (2528/5242), southern africa 18.6% (373/2163), west
africa 58.3% (3321/6608), asia 80.2% (1951/2436). prevalence pfmdr-1 86y was; 
east africa 32.4% (1447/5722), southern africa 36.1% (544/1640), west africa
52.2% (1986/4200), asia 46.4% (1276/2217). half, 52.6% (20/38) included
studies reported continued unofficial chloroquine use following policy change.
studies done madagascar kenya reported re-emergence chloroquine
sensitive parasites (ic50 < 30.9 nm). average time (years) since
discontinuation chloroquine use data collection 8.7 ± 7.4. was
high heterogeneity (i2 > 95%).
conclusion: prevalence chloroquine resistance alleles among plasmodium
falciparum parasites steadily declined since discontinuation chloroquine 
use. however, pfcrt k76t pfmdr-1 n86y mutations still persist moderate
frequencies malaria affected countries.
