malarial parasites evolved complex regulation heme supply disposal to
adjust heme-rich -deprived host environments. addition own
pathway heme biosynthesis, plasmodium likely harbors mechanisms heme
scavenging host erythrocytes. elaborate compartmentalization de novo heme
synthesis three subcellular locations, including vestigial plastid
organelle, indicates critical roles life cycle progression. study, 
systematically profile essentiality heme biosynthesis targeted gene
deletion enzymes early steps pathway. show disruption of
endogenous heme biosynthesis leads first detectable defect oocyst
maturation sporogony anopheles vector, whereas blood stage
propagation, colonization mosquito midguts, initiation oocyst
development occurs indistinguishably wild-type parasites. although
sporozoites produced parasites lacking intact pathway heme

we show liver stage parasites benefit strictly depend upon
their aminolevulinic acid synthase scavenge aminolevulinic 
acid host environment. together, experimental genetics analysis of
plasmodium enzymes heme biosynthesis exemplifies remarkable shifts between
