tools reliably measure plasmodium falciparum (pf) exposure individuals 
communities needed guide evaluate malaria control interventions.
serologic assays potentially produce precise exposure estimates low cost; 
however, current approaches based responses characterized antigens
are designed estimate exposure individuals. pf-specific antibody
responses differ antigen, suggesting selection antigens defined
kinetic profiles improve estimates pf exposure. identify novel
serologic biomarkers malaria exposure, evaluated responses 856 pf
antigens protein microarray 186 ugandan children, detailed pf
exposure data available. using data-adaptive statistical methods, we
identified combinations antibody responses maximized information an
individual's recent exposure. responses three novel pf antigens accurately
classified whether individual infected within last 30, 90, 365
d (cross-validated area curve = 0.86-0.93), whereas responses six
antigens accurately estimated individual's malaria incidence prior
year. cross-validated incidence predictions individuals different
communities provided accurate stratification exposure populations 
suggest precise estimates community exposure obtained from
sampling small subset community. addition, serologic incidence
predictions cross-sectional samples characterized heterogeneity within a
community similarly 1 continuous passive surveillance. development of
simple elisa-based assays derived successful selection strategy outlined
here offers potential generate rich epidemiologic surveillance data that
will widely accessible malaria control programs.
