background: sickle-cell-gene high frequency malaria endemic regions. 
india, though prevalence sickle-cell-gene malaria high, no
study carried out. study aims find possible differences 
in hematological clinical parameters severe falciparum malaria with
respect sickle cell genotypes.
methods: five hundred fourteen adults severe falciparum malaria hospitalized
in department medicine, veer surendra sai institute medical sciences and
research, burla, august, 2010 december, 2014 included and
categorized basis sickle cell genotypes. hematological parameters
were compared one-way-analysis-of-variance incidence sub-phenotypes 
severe malaria compared χ2 test across groups.
results: patients sickle cell anemia (hbss) severe falciparum malaria
had lower hemoglobin level compared patients normal β-globin genotype
(hbaa) sickle cell trait (hbas). hematological parameters were
homogeneous patients hbaa hbas different patients hbss.
incidence acute renal failure low (χ2, 9.91; p, 0.002) jaundice was
high (χ2, 5.20; p, 0.022) patients hbss. clinical difference was
observed patients hbaa hbas. mortality low (χ2, 4.33; p,
0.037) high (χ2, 10.48; p, 0.001) patients hbas hbss respectively
compared patients hbaa.
conclusion: though sickle-cell-gene protects falciparum infections, the
hematological parameters sub-phenotypes severe malaria remain unchanged
when infection progresses severe form patients hbaa hbas.
presence hemolytic anemia patients hbss shows diverse hematological
and clinical phenotypes compared others. high mortality patients with
hbss emphasizes need better preventive approach save valuable lives.
