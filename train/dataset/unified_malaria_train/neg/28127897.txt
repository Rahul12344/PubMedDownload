the rapidly evolving cloning sequencing technologies enabled
understanding genomic structure parasite genomes, opening new ways of
combatting parasite-related diseases. make exponentially
accumulating genomic data, however, crucial analyze proteins encoded
by genomic sequences. study, adopted engineered cell-free
protein synthesis system large-scale expression screening expression
sequence tag (est) library clonorchis sinensis identify potential antigens 
that used diagnosis treatment clonorchiasis. allow
high-throughput expression identification individual genes comprising 
library, cell-free synthesis reaction designed template 
dna expressed proteins co-immobilized microbeads,
leading microbead-based linkage genotype phenotype. reaction
configuration allowed streamlined expression, recovery, analysis proteins.
this approach enabled us identify 21 antigenic proteins. © 2017 american
