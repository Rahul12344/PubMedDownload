plasmodium falciparum, causative agent severe human malaria, employs
antigenic variation avoid host immunity. antigenic variation achieved by
transcriptional switching amongst polymorphic var genes, enforced epigenetic
modification chromatin. histone-modifying 'sirtuin' enzymes pfsir2a and
pfsir2b implicated process. disparate patterns var
expression reported patient isolates well cultured strains.
we examined var expression three commonly used laboratory strains (3d7, nf54
and fcr-3) parallel. nf54 parasites express significantly lower levels var 
genes compared 3d7, despite fact 3d7 originally clone the
nf54 strain. investigate whether linked expression of
sirtuins, genetic disruption sirtuins attempted three strains.
no dramatic changes var gene expression occurred nf54 fcr-3 following
pfsir2b disruption, contrasting previous observations 3d7. 3d7,
complementation pfsir2a genetic disruption resulted significant
decrease previously-elevated var gene expression levels, the
continued expression multiple var genes. finally, rearranged chromosomes 
observed 3d7 pfsir2a knockout line. results focus potential for
parasite genetic background contribute sirtuin function regulating
virulence gene expression suggest potential role sirtuins in
maintaining genome integrity.
