background: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iglurs) conserved ligand-gated
ion channel receptors, ionotropic receptors (irs) revealed new
family iglurs. subdivision unsettled, characteristics 
little known. anopheles sinensis major malaria vector eastern asia, and
its genome recently well sequenced annotated.
methods: identified iglur genes an. sinensis genome, analyzed their
characteristics including gene structure, genome distribution, domains and
specific sites bioinformatic methods, deduced phylogenetic relationships
of iglurs an. sinensis, anopheles gambiae drosophila melanogaster.
based characteristics phylogenetics, generated classification
of iglurs, comparatively analyzed intron number selective pressure of
three iglurs subdivisions, iglur group, antenna ir divergent ir subfamily.
results: total 56 iglur genes identified named whole-genome 
of an. sinensis. genes located 18 scaffolds, 31 (29
being irs) distributed 10 clusters suggested form mainly
from recent gene duplication. iglurs divided four groups: nmda,
non-nmda, antenna ir divergent ir based feature comparison and
phylogenetic analysis. ir8a ir25a suggested monophyletic, named as
putative study, moved antenna subfamily ir family to
the non-nmda group sister traditional non-nmda. generated iglurs of
genes (including nmda regenerated non-nmda) relatively conserved, and
have complicated gene structure, smaller ω values specific
functional sites. iglur genes an. sinensis, an. gambiae d.
melanogaster amino-terminal domain (atd), ligand binding domain (lbd) and
lig_chan domains, except ir8a lbd lig_chan domains.
however, new concept ir family genes (including regenerated antenna ir,
and divergent ir), especially divergent ir variable, simpler 
gene structure (intron loss phenomenon) larger ω values, lack specific
functional sites. ir genes domains except antenna irs
that lig_chan domain.
conclusions: study provides comprehensive information framework iglur 
genes an. sinensis, generated classification iglurs feature 
bioinformatics analyses. work lays foundation functional
study genes.
