background: plasmodium merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) released the
bloodstream merozoite invasion, thus represents crucial malarial
vaccine target. although substantial research effort devoted to
uncovering genetic diversity msp-1 p. falciparum p. vivax, there
is minimal information available regarding genetic profiles structure 
p. ovale. therefore, aim present study determine extent 
genetic variation among two subspecies p. ovale characterizing msp-1
n-terminal sequence nucleotide protein levels.
methods: n-terminal msp-1 gene amplified 126 clinical samples
collected imported cases malaria migrant workers returning jiangsu 
province africa using conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. 
the pcr products sequenced analyzed using genedoc, megalign,
mega7 dnasp v.6 programs.
results: average pairwise nucleotide diversities (Ï€) p. ovale curtisi 
p. ovale wallikeri msp-1 genes (pomsp1) 0.01043 0.01974, respectively,
and haplotype diversity (hd) 0.746 0.598, respectively. 
nucleotide substitutions detected non-synonymous, indicating the
genetic variations pomsp1 maintained positive diversifying selection, 
thereby suggesting role potential target protective immune
response. amino acid substitutions p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri
msp-1 could categorized five three unique amino acid variants,
respectively.
conclusions: low mutational diversity observed pomsp1 jiangsu
province imported malaria cases; studies developed as
immunogenicity functional analysis.
