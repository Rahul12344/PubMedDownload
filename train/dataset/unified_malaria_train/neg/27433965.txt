infections humans zoonotic simian malaria parasite plasmodium
knowlesi occur throughout southeast asia, although cases occurred in
malaysia, p. knowlesi dominant malaria species. apparently 
skewed distribution prompted investigation phylogeography this
parasite 2 geographically separated regions malaysia, peninsular malaysia
and malaysian borneo. investigated samples collected humans macaques 
in regions. haplotype network analyses sequences 2 p. knowlesi
genes, type small subunit ribosomal 18s rna cytochrome c oxidase subunit i,
showed 2 genetically distinct divergent clusters, 1 2 regions of
malaysia. propose parasites represent 2 distinct p. knowlesi types 
that independently became zoonotic. types would evolved the
sea-level rise end last ice age, separated malaysian borneo
from peninsular malaysia.
