background: leishmaniasis vector-borne neglected disease. inside natural
sand fly vector, promastigote forms leishmania undergo series of
extracellular developmental stages reach infectious stage, metacyclic 
promastigote. limited information regarding expression profile l.
infantum developmental stages inside sand fly vector, molecular markers
that distinguish different parasite stages lacking.
methodology/principal findings: performed rnaseq unaltered midguts the
sand fly lutzomyia longipalpis infection l. infantum parasites. rnaseq
was carried various time points throughout parasite development. principal
component analysis separated transcripts corresponding different
leishmania promastigote stages, procyclic, nectomonad, leptomonad and
metacyclics. importantly, significant number differentially
expressed genes comparing sequential development various
leishmania stages sand fly. 836 differentially expressed (de)
genes procyclic long nectomonad promastigotes; 113 de genes between
nectomonad leptomonad promastigotes; 302 de genes leptomonad 
metacyclic promastigotes. de genes overlap across stages,
highlighting uniqueness leishmania stage. furthermore, different 
stages leishmania parasites exhibited specific transcriptional enrichment
across chromosomes. using transcriptional signatures exhibited distinct
leishmania stages development sand fly midgut, determined 
the genes predominantly enriched stage, identifying multiple potential
stage-specific markers l. infantum.
conclusions: overall, findings demonstrate transcriptional plasticity
of leishmania parasite inside sand fly vector provide repertoire of
potential stage-specific markers development molecular tools for
epidemiological studies.
