background: control aedes aegypti, mosquito vector dengue, chikungunya 
and yellow fever, challenging task. pyrethroid insecticides emerged 
a preferred choice vector control threatened emergence of
resistance. present study reports focus pyrethroid resistance and
presence two kdr mutations--f1534c novel mutation t1520i, ae. aegypti
from delhi, india.
methodology/principal findings: insecticide susceptibility status adult-female
ae. aegypti ddt (4%), deltamethrin (0.05%) permethrin (0.75%) was
determined using who's standard insecticide susceptibility kit, revealed
resistance ddt, deltamethrin permethrin corrected mortalities 35%,
72% 76% respectively. mosquitoes screened presence kdr
mutations including reported earlier (i1011v/m, v1016g/i, f1534c, d1794y
and s989p), revealed presence f1534c novel mutation t1520i.
highly specific pcr-rflp assays developed genotyping two
mutations. genotyping using allele specific pcr new pcr-rflp assays revealed 
a high frequency f1534c (0.41-0.79) low frequency novel mutation t1520i
(0.13). latter observed tightly linked f1534c possibly
serve compensatory mutation. positive association f1534c mutation 
ddt deltamethrin resistance ae. aegypti established. however,
f1534c-kdr show significant protection permethrin.
conclusions/significance: aedes aegypti population delhi resistant to
ddt, deltamethrin permethrin. two kdr mutations, f1534c novel mutation 
t1520i, identified population. first report kdr
mutations present indian ae. aegypti population. highly specific
pcr-rflp assays developed discrimination alleles kdr loci. 
positive association f1534c mutation ddt deltamethrin resistance 
confirmed.
