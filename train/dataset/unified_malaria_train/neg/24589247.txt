background: malaria one important public health problems in
southeast asia, including hainan island, china. vector control main
malaria control measure, insecticide resistance major concern the
effectiveness chemical insecticide control programs. objective this
study determine resistance status main malaria vector species to
pyrethroids insecticides recommended world health organization
(who) indoor residual sprays.
methods: larvae pupae anopheles mosquitoes sampled multiple 
sites hainan island, five sites yielded sufficient mosquitoes for
insecticide susceptibility bioassays. bioassays female adult mosquitoes three 
days emergence conducted two abundant species, anopheles
sinensis an. vagus, using three insecticides (0.05% deltamethrin, 4% ddt, and
5% malathion) following standard tube assay procedure. p450
monooxygenase, glutathione s-transferase carboxylesterase activities were
measured. mutations knockdown resistance (kdr) gene ace-1 gene
were detected dna sequencing pcr-rflp analysis, respectively.
results: an. sinensis an. vagus predominant anopheles mosquito
species. an. sinensis found resistant ddt deltamethrin. an.
vagus susceptible deltamethrin resistant ddt malathion. low kdr
mutation (l1014f) frequency (<10%) detected an. sinensis, kdr
mutation detected an. vagus populations. modest high (45%-75%) ace-1
mutation frequency found an. sinensis populations, ace-1 mutation
was detected an. vagus populations. significantly higher p450 monooxygenase
and carboxylesterase activities detected deltamethrin-resistant an.
sinensis, significantly higher p450 monooxygenase, glutathione s-transferase 
and carboxylesterase activities found malathion-resistant an. vagus
mosquitoes.
conclusions: multiple insecticide resistance found an. sinensis an.
vagus hainan island, malaria-endemic area china. cost-effective
integrated vector control programs go beyond synthetic insecticides are
urgently needed.
