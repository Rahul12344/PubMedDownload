purpose review: need improved diagnosis optimal
classification patients infectious diseases. alternative approach to
the pathogen-detection strategy based comprehensive analysis host 
response infection. review focuses value transcriptome
analyses blood leukocytes diagnosis management patients with
infectious diseases.
recent findings: initial studies showed rna blood leukocytes of
children acute viral bacterial infections carried pathogen-specific
transcriptional signatures. subsequently, transcriptional signatures several 
other infections described validated humans malaria,
dengue, salmonella, melioidosis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza,
tuberculosis, hiv. addition, transcriptome analyses represent an
invaluable tool understand disease pathogenesis objectively classify
patients according clinical severity.
summary: microarray studies shown highly reproducible using
different platforms, different patient populations, confirming value
of blood transcriptome analyses study pathogen-specific host immune responses 
in clinical setting. combining detection pathogen a
comprehensive assessment host immune response provide new
understanding correlations specific causative agents, host
response, clinical manifestations disease.
