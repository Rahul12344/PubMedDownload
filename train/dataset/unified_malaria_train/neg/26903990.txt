ionic liquids discovery celebrated 100 years. consist solely ions,
one typically organic asymmetrical. remarkable physical and
chemical properties stirred use alternative solvents many chemical
processes. recent demonstration occurrence nature might boost
their interest biological sciences. search mechanistic
understandings ionic liquids' ecotoxicological impacts fungi, have
analyzed proteome, transcriptome, metabolome responses chemical
stress. data illuminated new hypotheses altered research path - exploit 
ionic liquids tools discovery pathways metabolites may
impact fungal development pathogenicity. get closer solve the
primary effects ionic liquid family specific gene targets, 
vision developing antifungal ionic liquids and/or materials, taking
advantage elegant progresses field, might become reality.
task-designed formulations may improve performance conventional antifungal
drugs, build functional coatings reducing allergens production, aid the
recovery antifungal plant polymers. frontier research this
cross-disciplinary field may provide us unforeseen means address global
concern mycotic diseases. pathogenic opportunistic fungi responsible
for numerous infections, killing annually nearly 1.5 million immunocompromised
individuals worldwide, similar rate malaria tuberculosis. this
perspective review major findings current hypotheses,
contextualizing might bring us closer efficient strategies prevent
and fight mycotic diseases.
