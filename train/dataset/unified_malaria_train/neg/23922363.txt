background: monitoring prevalence drug resistant plasmodium falciparum 
essential effective malaria control. resistance pyrimethamine and
sulfadoxine increases mutations accumulate parasite genes encoding
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), respectively.
although parasites exposed antifolate drugs simultaneously, it
remains virtually unknown whether dhfr dhps mutations accumulate along
interrelated paths.
methods: investigated order step-wise accumulation dhfr dhps 
cumulative analyses using binomial tests 575 p. falciparum isolates obtained
from 7 countries asia melanesia.
results: initial step accumulation mutations preferentially occurred
in dhfr (2 mutations), followed 1 mutation dhps. subsequent step,
mutations estimated separately 5 dhfr/dhps-resistant lineages identified
using 12 microsatellites flanking dhfr dhps. among lineages, found 3
major mutational paths, follows unique stepwise trajectory to
produce highly resistant form 4 mutations dhfr 3 dhps.
conclusions: ordered accumulation mutations dhfr dhps elucidated
here assist predicting status progression antifolate
resistance malaria-endemic regions antifolate drugs used for
intermittent preventive treatment.
