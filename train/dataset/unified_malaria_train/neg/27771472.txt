α-thalassemia (α-thal) among world's common single gene disorders,
generally attributed selective advantage heterozygotes malaria
mortality. high frequency -α3.7 deletion heterozygosity previously 
reported ashkenazi jews despite lack obvious malarial selection pressure in
this population. using haplotype -α3.7 subtype analysis analyzed subset 
of -α3.7 homozygotes various israeli ethnic groups. found high
frequency common ia haplotype yemenite jews arabs (54% 13%
respectively). ashkenazi jews exhibited high frequency iiib alleles (67%)
previously reported aboriginal australians found israeli
ethnicities. yemenites ashkenazim carried rare iih alleles (18% 
15% respectively). results may suggest multiple founder effects in
ashkenazi jews well common founder yemenite ashkenazi jews.
