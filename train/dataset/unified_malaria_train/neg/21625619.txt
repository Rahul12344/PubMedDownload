human genetics immune responses considered critically influence the
outcome malaria infections including life-threatening syndromes caused by
plasmodium falciparum. important role immune regulation assigned 
apoptosis-signaling cell surface receptor cd95 (fas, apo-1), encoded gene 
fas. here, candidate-gene association study including variant discovery 
fas gene locus carried case-control group comprising 1,195 pediatric
cases severe falciparum malaria 769 unaffected controls region
highly endemic malaria ghana, west africa. found allele of
c.-436c>a (rs9658676) located promoter region fas significantly
associated protection severe childhood malaria (odds ratio 0.71, 95%
confidence interval 0.58-0.88, p(empirical) = 0.02) confirmed finding in
a replication group 1,412 additional severe malaria cases 2,659 community 
controls geographic area. combined analysis resulted odds
ratio 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.80, p = 1.8×10⁻⁷, n = 6035). the
association applied c.-436aa homozygotes (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence
interval 0.36-0.60) lesser extent c.-436ac heterozygotes (odds ratio 
0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.84), also phenotypic subgroups
studied, including severe malaria anemia, cerebral malaria, malaria
complications. quantitative facs analyses assessing cd95 surface expression of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells naïve donors showed significantly higher 
proportion cd69+cd95+ cells among persons homozygous protective a
allele compared ac heterozygotes cc homozygotes, indicating functional
role associated cd95 variant, possibly supporting lymphocyte apoptosis.
