malaria, caused plasmodium sp, results almost one million deaths over
200 million new infections annually. world health organization has
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies used treatment of
malaria. artemisinin sesquiterpene lactone isolated plant artemisia
annua. however, supply price artemisinin fluctuate greatly, an
alternative production method would valuable increase availability. we
describe progress toward goal developing supply semisynthetic
artemisinin based production artemisinin precursor amorpha-4,11-diene
by fermentation engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae, chemical
conversion dihydroartemisinic acid, subsequently converted to
artemisinin. previous efforts produce artemisinin precursors used s.
cerevisiae s288c overexpressing selected genes mevalonate pathway [ro et
al. (2006) nature 440:940-943]. overexpressed every enzyme the
mevalonate pathway erg20 s. cerevisiae cen.pk2, compared production 
cen.pk2 engineered identically previously engineered s288c strain.
overexpressing every enzyme mevalonate pathway doubled artemisinic acid
production, however, amorpha-4,11-diene production 10-fold higher than
artemisinic acid. therefore focused amorpha-4,11-diene production.
development fermentation processes reengineered cen.pk2
amorpha-4,11-diene strain led production > 40 g/l product. chemical
process developed convert amorpha-4,11-diene dihydroartemisinic acid,
which could subsequently converted artemisinin. strains procedures 
described represent complete process production semisynthetic
artemisinin.
