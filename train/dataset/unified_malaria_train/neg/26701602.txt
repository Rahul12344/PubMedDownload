background: vaccine targeting plasmodium vivax essential component
of comprehensive malaria elimination program, major gaps our
understanding p. vivax biology, including protein-protein interactions
that mediate merozoite invasion reticulocytes, hinder search candidate
antigens. one ligand-receptor interaction identified, 
p. vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) erythrocyte duffy antigen receptor
for chemokines (darc), strain-specific immune responses pvdbp make a
complex vaccine target. broaden repertoire potential p. vivax
merozoite-stage vaccine targets, exploited recent breakthrough expressing
full-length ectodomains plasmodium proteins functionally-active form in
mammalian cells initiated large-scale study p. vivax merozoite proteins 
that potentially involved reticulocyte binding invasion.
methodology/principal findings: selected 39 p. vivax proteins are
predicted localize merozoite surface invasive secretory organelles, 
some show homology p. falciparum vaccine candidates. these, we
were able express 37 full-length protein ectodomains mammalian expression
system, previously used express p. falciparum invasion ligands 
such pfrh5. establish whether expressed proteins correctly folded,
we assessed whether recognized antibodies cambodian patients
with acute vivax malaria. igg samples showed least two-fold
change reactivity na√Øve controls 27 34 antigens tested, the
majority showed heat-labile igg immunoreactivity, suggesting presence of
conformation-sensitive epitopes native tertiary protein structures. using a
method specifically designed detect low-affinity, extracellular
protein-protein interactions, confirmed predicted interaction p.
vivax 6-cysteine proteins p12 p41, suggesting proteins are
natively folded functional. screen also identified two novel
protein-protein interactions, p12 pvx_110945, msp3.10 and
msp7.1, latter confirmed surface plasmon resonance.
conclusions/significance: produced new library recombinant full-length p.
vivax ectodomains, established majority contain tertiary
structure, used identify predicted novel protein-protein
interactions. well identifying new interactions biological
studies, library useful identifying p. vivax proteins with
vaccine potential, studying p. vivax malaria pathogenesis immunity.
