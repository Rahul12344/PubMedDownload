apicidins cyclic tetrapeptides histone deacetylase inhibitory activity. 
since discovery 1996 multitude studies concerning activity
against protozoa certain cancer cell lines natural synthetic apicidin 
analogues published. now, published natural sources of
apicidin fungus fusarium pallidoroseum, later known f. semitectum 
two unspecified fusarium strains. biosynthetic origin apicidins could be
associated gene cluster, biosynthetic pathway proposed.
recently, group able identify first time apicidin-like gene
cluster f. fujikuroi apparently lead production any
known apicidin analogue. overexpressing pathway-specific transcription
factor able identify new apicidin-like compound. present study
provides complete structure elucidation new compound, named apicidin
f. activity evaluation plasmodium falciparum showed good vitro
activity ic50 value 0.67 μm.
