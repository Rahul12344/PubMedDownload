the recent advances next-generation sequencing technologies provide new 
effective way tracking malaria drug-resistant parasites. take advantage 
this technology, end-to-end illumina targeted amplicon deep sequencing (tads) 
and bioinformatics pipeline molecular surveillance drug resistance p.
falciparum, called malaria resistance surveillance (mars), developed. tads
relies pcr enriching genomic regions, specifically target genes interest,
prior deep sequencing. mars enables researchers simultaneously collect data
on allele frequencies multiple full-length p. falciparum drug resistance genes
(crt, mdr1, k13, dhfr, dhps, cytochrome b gene), well the
mitochondrial genome. information captured individual patient level for
both known potential new single nucleotide polymorphisms associated drug
resistance. mars pipeline validated using 245 imported malaria cases that
were reported centers disease control prevention (cdc). the
chloroquine resistance crt cviet genotype (mutations underlined) observed 
42% samples, highly pyrimethamine-resistant dhpsirn triple mutant 92%
of samples, sulfadoxine resistance dhps mutation sgeaa 26% samples.
the mdr1 nfsnd genotype found 40% samples. exception two
cases imported cambodia, artemisinin resistance k13 alleles were
identified, 99% patients carried parasites susceptible to
atovaquone-proguanil. goal implement mars cdc routine
surveillance imported malaria cases united states aid the
adoption system participating state public health laboratories, as
well global partners.
