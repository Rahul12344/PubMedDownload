parasites comprise diverse complex organisms, substantially impact
human animal health. parasites complex life-cycles, virtue
of co-evolution developed multifaceted, often life-cycle stage-specific
relationships immune system hosts. complexity the
biology many parasites often limits knowledge parasite-specific immune 
responses, vitro studies only. relatively recent development methods
to stably manipulate genetic make-up many parasites allowed better
understanding host-parasite interactions, particularly vivo. this
regard, use transgenic parasites facilitate study of
immunomodulatory mechanisms vivo conditions. therefore, review, 
we specifically highlighted current developments use transgenic
parasites unravel host's immune response different life-cycle stages of
some key parasite species leishmania, schistosoma, toxoplasma, plasmodium
and trypanosome degree, use transgenic nematode parasites is
also briefly discussed.
