sand flies bite mammalian hosts obtain blood meal, driving changes the
host inflammatory response support establishment leishmania
infection. effect partially attributed components sand fly saliva, 
which able recruit activate leukocytes. group shown heme 
oxygenase-1 (ho-1) favors leishmania survival infected cells reducing
inflammatory responses. here, show exposure sand fly bites is
associated induction ho-1 vivo. histopathological analyses skin
specimens human volunteers experimentally exposed sand fly bites revealed
that ho-1 nrf2 produced bite sites skin. results were
recapitulated mice ears injected salivary gland sonicate (sgs) or
exposed sand fly bites, indicating vector saliva may key factor in
triggering ho-1 expression. resident skin macrophages main source ho-1
at 24-48 h bites. additionally, assays vivo bites vitro
after stimulation saliva demonstrated ho-1 production by
macrophages nrf2-dependent. collectively, data demonstrates vector
saliva induces early ho-1 production bite sites, representing major
event associated establishment naturally-transmitted leishmania
infections.
