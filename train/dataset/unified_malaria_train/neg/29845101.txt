anopheles stephensi liston one major vectors malaria urban areas 
of india. midgut plays central role vector life cycle transmission
of malaria. gene expression an. stephensi midgut been
investigated protein level, unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomic
analysis midgut tissue carried out. midgut tissue proteins female an.
stephensi mosquitoes extracted using 0.5% sds digested trypsin
using two complementary approaches, in-gel in-solution digestion. fractions
were analysed high-resolution mass spectrometer, resulted acquisition
of 494,960 ms/ms spectra. ms/ms spectra searched protein
database comprising known predicted proteins reported an. stephensi
using sequest mascot software. all, 47,438 peptides identified
corresponding 5,709 an. stephensi proteins. identified proteins were
functionally categorized based cellular localization, biological
processes molecular functions using gene ontology (go) annotation. several
proteins identified data known mediate interaction the
plasmodium vector midgut also regulate parasite maturation inside the
vector host. study provides information protein composition in
midgut tissue female an. stephensi, would useful understanding
vector parasite interaction molecular level besides useful in
devising malaria transmission blocking strategies. data study is
related research article "integrating transcriptomics proteomics data 
for accurate assembly annotation genomes".
