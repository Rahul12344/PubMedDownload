background: pyrethroid resistance major malaria vector anopheles funestus 
is rapidly expanding across southern africa. remains unknown whether this
resistance unique origin molecular basis is
multifactorial. knowledge origin, mechanisms evolution resistance
are crucial designing successful resistance management strategies.
results: here, established resistance profile zambian an. funestus
population northern range resistance front. similar other
southern african populations, zambian an. funestus mosquitoes resistant to
pyrethroids carbamate, contrast populations mozambique and
malawi, insects also ddt resistant. genome-wide microarray-based
transcriptional profiling qrt-pcr revealed cytochrome p450 gene
cyp6m7 responsible extending pyrethroid resistance northwards. indeed,
cyp6m7 over-expressed zambia [fold-change (fc) 37.7; 13.2 qrt-pcr]
than cyp6p9a (fc15.6; 8.9 qrt-pcr) cyp6p9b (fc11.9; 6.5 qrt-pcr),
whereas cyp6p9a cyp6p9b highly over-expressed malawi and
mozambique. transgenic expression cyp6m7 drosophila melanogaster coupled
with vitro assays using recombinant enzymes assessments kinetic
properties demonstrated cyp6m7 efficient cyp6p9a cyp6p9b in
conferring pyrethroid resistance. polymorphism patterns demonstrate these
genes contrasting selection forces: exceptionally diverse cyp6m7
likely evolves neutrally, whereas cyp6p9a cyp6p9b directionally selected.
the higher variability cyp6p9a cyp6p9b observed zambia supports their
lesser role resistance country.
conclusion: pyrethroid resistance southern africa probably multiple
origins different evolutionary forces, may necessitate design 
different resistance management strategies.
