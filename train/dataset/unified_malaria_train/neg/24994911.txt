background: efficacy artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) for
plasmodium falciparum malaria may threatened parasites reduced
responsiveness artemisinins. among 298 act-treated children mbita, kenya,
submicroscopic persistence p. falciparum day 3 posttreatment associated
with subsequent microscopically detected parasitemia days 28 42.
methods: dna sequences resistance-associated parasite loci pfcrt, pfmdr1,
pfubp1, pfap2mu determined mbita cohort treatment, days
2 3 initiation treatment, day treatment failure.
results: parasites surviving act day 2 day 3 posttreatment were
significantly likely baseline population carry wild-type
haplotypes pfcrt (cvmnk codons 72-76; p < .001) pfmdr1 (nfd codons
86, 184, 1246; p < .001). contrast, variant alleles novel candidate
resistance genes pfap2mu (s160n/t; p = .006) pfubp-1 (e1528d; p < .001) 
significantly prevalent posttreatment. genetic similarities found to
artemisinin-tolerant parasites recently described cambodia.
conclusions: among treated children western kenya, certain p. falciparum
genotypes defined pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfap2mu, pfubp1 often survive act at
the submicroscopic level, contribute onward transmission subsequent
patent recrudescence.
