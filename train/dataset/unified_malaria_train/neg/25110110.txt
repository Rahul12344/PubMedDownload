variability susceptibility infectious disease clinical
manifestation determined variation environment genetic
variation pathogen host. despite several successes based on
candidate gene studies, defining host variation affecting infectious disease 
has successful multifactorial diseases. single
nucleotide variation copy number variation (cnv) host contribute to
the host's susceptibility infectious disease. review focus cnv, 
particularly complex multiallelic cnv often well characterised
either directly hybridisation methods indirectly analysis genotypes
and flanking single nucleotide variants. summarise well-known examples,
such Î±-globin deletion susceptibility severe malaria, well more
recent controversies, extensive cnv chemokine gene ccl3l1 
hiv infection. discuss potential biological mechanisms could underly 
any genetic association reflect extensive complexity functional
variation generated combination cnv sequence variation, as
illustrated fc gamma receptor genes fcgr3a, fcgr3b fcgr2c. also
highlight understudied areas might prove fruitful areas further
research.
