kinesin-8 proteins microtubule motors often involved regulation
of mitotic spindle length chromosome alignment. move towards plus
ends spindle microtubules regulate dynamics ends due, at
least species, microtubule depolymerization activity. plasmodium
spp. exhibit atypical endomitotic cell division chromosome
condensation spindle dynamics different proliferative stages not
well understood. genome-wide shared orthology analysis plasmodium spp.
revealed presence two kinesin-8 motor proteins, kinesin-8x kinesin-8b.
here studied biochemical properties kinesin-8x role parasite
proliferation. vitro, kinesin-8x motility depolymerization activities 
like kinesin-8 motors. understand role plasmodium kinesin-8x in
cell division, used fluorescence-tagging live cell imaging define its
location, gene targeting analyse function, proliferative
stages rodent malaria parasite p. berghei life cycle. results revealed
a spatio-temporal involvement kinesin-8x spindle dynamics an
association mitotic meiotic spindles putative microtubule
organising centre (mtoc). deletion kinesin-8x gene revealed defect in
oocyst development, confirmed ultrastructural studies, suggesting this
protein required oocyst development sporogony. transcriptome analysis 
of Î´kinesin-8x gametocytes revealed modulated expression genes involved mainly
in microtubule-based processes, chromosome organisation regulation of
gene expression, supporting role kinesin-8x cell division. kinesin-8x is
thus required parasite proliferation within mosquito transmission
to vertebrate host.
