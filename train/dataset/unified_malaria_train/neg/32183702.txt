background: plasmodium genus malaria parasites encodes several families of
antigen-encoding genes. genes tend hyper-variable, highly
recombinogenic variantly expressed. best-characterized family var 
genes, exclusively found laveranian subgenus malaria parasites
infecting humans great apes. var genes encode major virulence factors
involved immune evasion maintenance chronic infections. the
human parasite p. falciparum, var gene recombination diversification appear
to promoted g-quadruplex (g4) dna motifs, strongly associated
with var genes p. falciparum. here, investigated association might
have evolved across plasmodium species - laverania also distantly
related species lack vars encode other, ancient variant gene
families.
results: association var genes g4-forming motifs conserved
across laverania, spanning ~â€‰1 million years evolutionary time, with
suggestive evidence evolution association occurring within this
subgenus. rodent malaria species, g4-forming motifs somewhat associated
with pir genes, conserved laverania, find a
strong association motifs gene family second outgroup of
avian malaria parasites. secondly, compared two different g4 prediction
algorithms performance extremely a/t-rich plasmodium genomes, and
also compared predictions experimental data g4-seq, dna
sequencing method identifying g4-forming motifs. found surprising lack
of concordance two algorithms also algorithms and
g4-seq data.
conclusions: g4-forming motifs uniquely strongly associated plasmodium
var genes, suggesting particular role g4s recombination and
diversification genes. secondly, a/t-rich genomes plasmodium
species, choice prediction algorithm may particularly influential 
studying g4s important protozoan pathogens.
