gene editing kind technologies makes precise modification the
genome. used knock out/in replace specific dna fragment, and
make accurate gene editing genome level. essence technique is
the dna sequence change use non homologous end link repair homologous
recombination repair, combined specific dna target recognition and
endonuclease.this technology wide range development prospects high
application value terms scientific research, agriculture, medical treatment
and fields. field gene therapy, gene editing technology has
achieved cross-time success cancers leukemia, genetic disorders such
as hemophilia, thalassemia, multiple muscle nutritional disorders retrovirus 
associated infectious diseases aids diseases. preparation
work new experimental methods animal models combined gene editing
technology rapid development improvement. laboratories around the
world also applied gene editing technique prevention malaria, organ
transplantation, biological pharmaceuticals, agricultural breeding improvement,
resurrection extinct species, research areas. paper summarizes 
the application development status gene editing technique above
fields, also preliminarily explores potential application prospect the
technology field traditional chinese medicine, discusses the
present controversy thoughts.
