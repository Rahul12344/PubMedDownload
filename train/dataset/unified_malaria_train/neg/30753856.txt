malaria parasite oocysts generate sporozoites process termed sporogony.
essential successful sporogony plasmodium berghei anopheles stephensi
mosquitoes complex six lccl lectin domain adhesive-like proteins (laps). 
lap null mutant oocysts undergo growth mitosis fail form sporozoites. 
at cytological level, lap null mutant oocyst development indistinguishable
from wildtype counterparts first week, supporting hypothesis that
lap null mutant oocysts develop normally cytokinesis. show that
lap1 null mutant oocysts display highly reduced expression sporozoite proteins
and transcription factors. findings indicate events leading 
the cytokinesis defect lap null mutants occur early oocyst development.
