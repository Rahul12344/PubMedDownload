background: performance plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich
protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) evaluate suspected malaria in
low-endemicity settings well characterized.
methods: using dried blood spot samples patients suspected malaria at
37 health facilities 2012 2014 low-endemicity country of
swaziland, investigated diagnostic accuracy histidine-rich protein
2-based rdts using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) (nested pcr
targeting cytochrome b gene) quantitative pcr reference standards. 
explore reasons false-negative and/or false-positive results, used
pfhrp2/3-specific pcr logistic regression analyses potentially associated 
epidemiological factors.
results: 1353 patients, 93.0% rdt-positive (n = 185) 31.2% of
rdt-negative samples (n = 340) available selected testing. compared 
with nested pcr, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv),
and negative predictive value (npv) rdts 51.7%, 94.1%, 67.3%, 89.1%, 
respectively. exclusion samples parasite densities <100/μl, which
accounted 75.7% false-negative results 33.3% pcr-detectable
infections, sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv 78.8%, 93.7%, 62.3%, 
and 97.1%. deletions pfhrp2 detected. false-positivity more
likely second year associated demographics, recent
malaria, health facility testing characteristics, potential dna degradation.
conclusions: low-transmission setting swaziland, demonstrated low
sensitivity rdt malaria diagnosis, owing unexpectedly high
proportion low-density infection among symptomatic subjects. ppv also 
low, requiring investigation. accurate point-of-care diagnostic
may needed support malaria elimination efforts.
