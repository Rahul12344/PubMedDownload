recombinant versions cr1 produced analyzed, focusing complement
control protein modules (ccps) 15-25 ectodomain. eleven modules
encompass region (ccps 15-17) key rosetting, opsonin recognition and
complement regulation, well knops blood group polymorphisms ccps

indeed, four cr1 15-25 variants virtually indistinguishable affinities
