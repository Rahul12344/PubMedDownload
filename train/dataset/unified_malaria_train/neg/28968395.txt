background: anopheles balabacensis leucospyrus group confirmed as
the primary knowlesi malaria vector sabah, malaysian borneo time now.
presently, knowlesi malaria zoonotic simian malaria malaysia 
a high prevalence recorded states sabah sarawak.
methodology/principal findings: anopheles spp. sampled using human landing
catch (hlc) method paradason village kudat district sabah. collected
anopheles identified morphologically subjected total dna
extraction polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detect plasmodium parasites 
the mosquitoes. identification plasmodium spp. confirmed sequencing the
ssu rrna gene species specific primers. mega4 software used to
analyse ssu rrna sequences bulid phylogenetic tree inferring 
relationship simian malaria parasites sabah. pcr results showed that
only 1.61% (23/1,425) screened an. balabacensis infected one 
two five simian plasmodium spp. found sabah, viz. plasmodium coatneyi, 
p. inui, p. fieldi, p. cynomolgi p. knowlesi. sequence analysis ssu rrna
of plasmodium isolates showed high percentage identity within same
plasmodium sp. group. phylogenetic tree based consensus sequences of
p. knowlesi showed 99.7%-100.0% nucleotide identity among isolates an.
balabacensis, human patients long-tailed macaque locality.
conclusions/significance: first study showing high molecular identity
between p. knowlesi isolates an. balabacensis, human patients a
long-tailed macaque sabah. common simian plasmodium spp. found in
long-tailed macaques also detected an. balabacensis p. coatneyi, p.
inui, p. fieldi p. cynomolgi. high percentage identity nucleotide
sequences p. knowlesi isolates long-tailed macaque, an.
balabacensis human patients suggests close genetic relationship the
parasites hosts.
