children highly susceptible clinical malaria, regions malaria
is endemic, immune systems must face successive encounters plasmodium 
falciparum parasites develop immunity, first severe disease
and later uncomplicated malaria. understanding cellular molecular
interactions host parasites infection could provide
insights processes underlying gradual acquisition immunity, as
well parasites adapt infect hosts successively malaria
experienced. here, describe methods analyze host parasite gene
expression profiles generated simultaneously blood samples collected from
five consecutive symptomatic p. falciparum infections three malian children.
we show data generated enable statistical assessment proportions 
of (i) white blood cell subset (ii) parasite developmental stages,
as well investigations host-parasite gene coexpression. also use the
sequences generated analyze allelic variations transcribed regions and
determine complexity infection. limited modest sample
size, analyses suggest host gene expression profiles primarily clustered
by individual, parasite gene expression profiles seemed to
differentiate early late infections. overall, study provides solid
framework examine mechanisms underlying acquisition immunity malaria
infections using whole-blood transcriptome sequencing (rna-seq).importance we
show dual rna-seq patient blood samples allows characterization of
host/parasite interactions malaria infections provide solid
framework study acquisition antimalarial immunity, well the
adaptations p. falciparum malaria-experienced hosts.
