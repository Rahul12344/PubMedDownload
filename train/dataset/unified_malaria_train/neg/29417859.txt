hemoglobinopathies group inherited single gene disorders. are
reports hemoglobin (hb) variants identified tribal non-tribal
populations tripura state northeastern india. study aimed determine
the spectrum hemoglobinopathies enzymopathies newborn screening in
tripura state assess extent neonatal jaundice. total 2400 cord
blood samples collected analyzed high performance liquid
chromatography (hplc). confirmation abnormal hplc done dna 
analysis. samples also screened deficiency enzymopathies,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency pyruvate kinase. of
2400 cord blood samples screened, 225 (9.3%) hb e (hbb: c.79g>a)
heterozygotes, 80 (3.3%) hb e homozygotes one carried hb e-β-thalassemia
(β-thal). hb abnormalities also detected including 15 hb (hbb:
c.20a>t) heterozygotes, two hb d-punjab (hbb: c.364g>c) heterozygotes two
compound heterozygotes hb d-punjab hb e. 80 homozygous hb e
babies, four non-tribal 76 babies tribal, 225 patients carried 
hb e trait, 141 tribal, 84 non-tribal. 40 g6pd deficient
babies identified, 13 coinherited hb e two babies pyruvate kinase
deficiency. α genotyping performed 162 affected babies, 50 carried
α gene deletions. newborn screening programs hb e, hemoglobinopathies
and g6pd deficiency must encouraged malaria-endemic northeastern region
of india. drug-induced hemolysis also avoided screening g6pd
deficiency birth.
