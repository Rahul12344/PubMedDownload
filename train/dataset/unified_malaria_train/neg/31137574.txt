malaria infectious disease caused plasmodium group. mechanisms of
antimalarial drugs dha/cq still unclear today. inhibitory effects (ic50) 
of single treatments dha/cq v-atpase inhibitor baf-a1 combination
treatments dha/cq combined baf-a1 growth plasmodium falciparum 
strain 3d7 investigated. intracellular cytoplasmic ph labile iron pool
(lip) labeled ph probe bcecf, iron probe calcein, am, the
fluorescence probes measured fcm. effects low doses dha
(0.2 nm, 0.4 nm, 0.8 nm) gene expression v-atpases (vape, vapa, vapg)
located membrane dv tested rt-qpcr. dha combined baf-a1
showed synergism effect (ci = 0.524) parasite growth the
concentration ic50. intracellular ph irons effected significantly 
different doses dha/baf-a1. intracellular ph decreased cq combined with
baf-a1 concentration ic50. intracellular lip increased dha
combined baf-a1 concentration 20 ic50. expression gene vapa
was down-regulated low doses dha (0.2/0.4/0.8 nm) significantly (p <
0.001) expression vapg/vape up-regulated 0.8 nm dha
significantly (p < 0.001). interacting ferrous irons, affecting dv
membrane proton pumping acidic ph cytoplasmic irons homeostasis may the
antimalarial mechanism dha cq showed effect cytoplasmic ph of
parasite vitro. lastly, article provides us preliminary results new
idea antimalarial drugs combination new potential antimalarial
combination therapies.
