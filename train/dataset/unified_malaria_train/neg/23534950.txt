we review recent data glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd),
the housekeeping x-linked gene encoding first enzyme pentose phosphate
pathway (ppp), nadph-producing dehydrogenase. enzyme popular
among clinicians, biochemists, geneticists molecular biologists is
the common form red blood cell enzymopathy. g6pd deficient erythrocytes
do generate nadph way ppp reason
they susceptible cells oxidative damage. moreover,
this enzyme also crucial importance many significant discoveries; 
indeed, g6pd polymorphisms instrumental studying x-inactivation in
the human species, well establishing clonal nature certain
tumors. g6pd deficiency, generally considered mild benign condition, 
significantly disadvantageous certain environmental conditions like in
presence certain drugs. nevertheless, g6pd deficiency positively
selected malaria, recent knowledge seems show also confers an
advantage development cancer, reduces risk coronary
diseases beneficial effect terms longevity.
