osteoarthritis (oa) progressive degenerative joint disorder is
highly prevalent worldwide currently effective medical 
therapy. artesunate (art), natural compound used treat malaria, possesses
diverse biological properties, including regulation inflammation and
apoptosis various cells; however, role oa remains unclear. aim of
the present study investigate effects art interleukin
(il)‑1β‑induced chondrocyte‑like atdc5 cells oa mouse model. the
results revealed art dose‑dependently relieved inhibitory effect of
il‑1β cell viability. moreover, art significantly reduced overexpression
of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)‑3, mmp‑13, disintegrin metalloproteinase 
with thrombospondin motifs‑5 cyclooxygenase‑2 gene protein
levels chondrocyte‑like atdc5 cells stimulated il‑1β. furthermore, art
decreased expression pro‑apoptotic bax, cleaved caspase‑3 cleaved
caspase‑7 dose‑dependent manner, increased expression the
anti‑apoptotic factor bcl‑2. changes mediated inhibitory effect
of art nuclear factor‑κb signaling pathway, defined repression the
phosphorylation iκbα p65, improved redistribution p65.
additionally, art blocked advancement calcified cartilage zone the
loss proteoglycan, lowered histological scoring oa mouse model.
taken together, results indicate art may value therapeutic 
agent oa.
