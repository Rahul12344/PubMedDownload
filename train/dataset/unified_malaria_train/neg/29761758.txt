in peruvian north coast (pnc), number plasmodium vivax malaria cases
increased steadily 2007 2010 despite significant decline overall
number cases peru period. better understand the
transmission dynamics p. vivax populations pnc neighboring
ecuadorian amazon basin (eab), studied genetic variability population 
structure p. vivax areas. one hundred twenty p. vivax isolates
(58 piura 37 tumbes pnc collected 2008 2010 25
from eab collected pastaza 2001 2004) assessed five
polymorphic microsatellite markers. genetic variability determined by
expected heterozygosity (he) population structure bayesian inference
cluster analysis. found low genetic diversity pnc (he = 0-0.32)
but high genetic diversity eab (he = 0.43-0.70). population structure
analysis revealed three distinct populations three locations. six 37
(16%) isolates tumbes identical haplotype found piura,
suggesting unidirectional flow piura tumbes. addition, one haplotype
from tumbes showed similarity haplotype found pastaza, suggesting that
this could imported case eab. findings strongly suggest a
minimal population flow different levels genetic variability these
two areas divided andes mountains. work presents molecular markers
that could used increase understanding regional malaria transmission
dynamics, implications development strategies p. vivax
control.
