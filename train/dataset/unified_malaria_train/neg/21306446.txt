clonally variant gene expression common survival strategy used many
pathogens, including malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. among genes 
that show variant expression parasite several members small gene
families linked erythrocyte invasion, including clag eba families. the
active repressed state genes clonally transmitted epigenetic
mechanisms. characterized promoters clag3.1, clag3.2 eba-140, 
and compared nuclease accessibility post-translational histone modifications 
between active repressed states. activity promoters an
episomal context similar parasite subclones characterized different
patterns expression endogenous genes. variant expression controlled 
by euchromatic heterochromatic state bistable chromatin domains.
repression mediated h3k9me3-based heterochromatin, whereas active state
is characterized h3k9ac. marks maintained throughout asexual
blood cycle transmit epigenetic memory. furthermore, eba-140 organized 
in two distinct chromatin domains, probably separated barrier insulator
located within orf. 5' chromatin domain controls expression gene, 
whereas 3' domain shares chromatin conformation upstream region 
of neighbouring phista family gene, also shows variant expression.
