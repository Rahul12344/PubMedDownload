iron supplementation may adverse health effects infants, probably through
manipulation gut microbiome. previous research low-resource settings
have focused primarily anemic infants. double blind, randomized,
controlled trial home fortification comparing multiple micronutrient powder
(mnp) without iron. six-month-old, non- mildly anemic,
predominantly-breastfed kenyan infants rural malaria-endemic area were
randomized consume: (1) mnp containing 12.5 mg iron (mnp+fe, n = 13); (2) mnp 
containing iron (mnp-fe, n = 13); (3) placebo (control, n = 7), 6-9
months age. fecal microbiota profiled high-throughput bacterial 16s
rrna gene sequencing. markers inflammation serum stool samples were
also measured. baseline, abundant phylum proteobacteria (37.6% of
rrna sequences). proteobacterial genus escherichia abundant
genus across phyla (30.1% sequences). end intervention, 
relative abundance escherichia significantly decreased mnp-fe (-16.05 ±
6.9%, p = 0.05) control (-19.75 ± 4.5%, p = 0.01), mnp+fe
group (-6.23 ± 9%, p = 0.41). second abundant genus baseline was
bifidobacterium (17.3%), relative abundance significantly decreased 
in mnp+fe (-6.38 ± 2.5%, p = 0.02) control (-8.05 ± 1.46%, p = 0.01), not
in mnp-fe (-4.27 ± 5%, p = 0.4445). clostridium increased mnp-fe (1.9 ±
0.5%, p = 0.02). significant differences observed inflammation
markers, except il-8, decreased control. mnp fortification over
three months non- mildly anemic kenyan infants potentially alter the
gut microbiome. consistent previous research, addition iron mnp
may adversely affect colonization potential beneficial microbes and
attenuate decrease potential pathogens.
