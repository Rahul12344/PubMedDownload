the african continent currently experiencing rapid population growth, with
rising urbanization increasing percentage population living large
towns cities. studied impact degree urbanization the
population genetics plasmodium falciparum urban peri-urban areas and
around city brazzaville, republic congo. field setting, which
incorporates local health centers situated areas varying urbanization, is
of interest allows characterization malaria parasites areas
where human, parasite, mosquito populations shared, where
differences degree urbanization (leading dramatic differences in
transmission intensity) cause pattern malaria transmission differ
greatly. investigated differences transmission intensity
affect parasite genetic diversity, including amount genetic polymorphism
in area, degree linkage disequilibrium within populations, and
the prevalence frequency drug resistance markers. determine parasite
population structure, heterozygosity linkage disequilibrium, typed eight
microsatellite markers performed haplotype analysis msp1 gene pcr. 
mutations known associated resistance antimalarial drugs
chloroquine pyrimethamine determined sequencing relevant portions
of crt dhfr genes, respectively. found parasite genetic diversity
was comparable two sites, high levels polymorphism being
maintained areas despite dramatic differences transmission intensity. 
crucially, found frequencies genetic markers drug resistance
against pyrimethamine chloroquine differed significantly sites,
indicative differing selection pressures two areas.
