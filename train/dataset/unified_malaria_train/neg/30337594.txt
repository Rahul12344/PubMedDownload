malaria infection pregnancy, caused sequestering plasmodium
falciparum parasites placenta, leads high infant mortality maternal
morbidity. parasite-placenta adherence mechanism mediated var2csa
protein, target natural occurring immunity. currently, vaccine development 
is based id1-dbl2xb domain however little known global
genetic diversity encoding var2csa gene, could influence vaccine
efficacy. comprehensive analysis var2csa gene >2,000 p. falciparum
field isolates across 23 countries, found var2csa duplicated high
prevalence (>25%), african oceanian populations harbour much higher
diversity regions, insertions/deletions abundant leading 
to underestimation diversity locus. further, id1-dbl2xb
haplotypes associated adverse birth outcomes present globally, and
african-specific haplotypes exist, incorporated vaccine
design.
