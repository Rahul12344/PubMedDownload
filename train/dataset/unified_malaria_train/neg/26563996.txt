dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (dde) primary environmental metabolic
degradation product pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt). is
one toxic compounds belonging organochlorines. dde never 
commercially produced; however, parent pesticide ddt still used some
developing countries disease-vector control malaria. ddt dde remain in
the environment chemicals resistant degradation and
bioaccumulate food chain. little known, however, dde toxicity
during early stages neural development. results present study
demonstrate dde induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis caused the
global dna hypomethylation mouse embryonic neuronal cells. study also
provided evidence dde-isomer-non-specific alterations retinoid x receptor 
α (rxrα)- retinoid x receptor β (rxrβ)-mediated intracellular signaling,
including changes levels receptor mrnas changes protein 
levels receptors. dde-induced stimulation rxrα rxrβ verified
using selective antagonist specific sirnas. co-localization rxrα rxrβ 
was demonstrated using confocal microscopy. apoptotic action dde was
supported cellular level hoechst 33342 calcein staining
experiments. conclusion, results present study demonstrated that
the stimulation rxrα- rxrβ-mediated intracellular signaling plays an
important role propagation dde-induced apoptosis early stages of
neural development.
