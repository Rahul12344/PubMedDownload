heterogeneity high plasticity common features cells the
mononuclear phagocyte system: monocytes (mos), macrophages, dendritic cells
(dcs). upon activation microbial agents, mo differentiate mo-derived 
dcs (modcs). previous work, shown acute infection with
plasmodium berghei anka (pba), modcs become, transiently, main cd11b+ myeloid
population spleen (sp) recruited brain play important
role development experimental cerebral malaria (ecm). here, isolated
4 cell populations: bone marrow (bm) mos (bm-mos) sp-mos uninfected
mice; bm inflammatory mos (bm-imos) sp-modcs pba-infected mice used 
a system biology approach holistic transcriptomic comparison provide 
interactome analysis integrating differentially expressed mirnas (dems) and
their differentially expressed gene targets (degs) data. jaccard index (ji)
was used gauging similarity diversity among cell populations.
whereas bm-mos, bm-imos, sp-mos presented high similarity degs, sp-modcs
distinguished showing greater number degs. moreover, functional analysis 
identified enrichment canonical pathways, dc maturation,
neuroinflammation, ifn signaling. upstream regulator analysis identified ifnγ
as potential upstream molecule explain observed dems-target degs
intersections sp-modcs. finally, directed target analysis vivo/ex vivo 
assays indicate sp-modcs differentiate sp ifnγ main driver
of process.
