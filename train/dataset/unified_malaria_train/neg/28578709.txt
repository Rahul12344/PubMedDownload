background: plasmodium vivax remains potential cause morbidity mortality
for people living endemic areas. understanding genetic diversity p.
vivax different regions valuable studying population dynamics and
tracing origins parasites. pvmsp-1 gene highly polymorphic 
been used marker many p. vivax population studies. aim study 
was investigate genetic diversity pvmsp-1 gene icb5-6 fragment 
to provide genetic polymorphism data studies p. vivax
population structure tracking origin clinical cases.
methods: nested pcr sequencing pvmsp-1 icb5-6 marker performed to
obtain nucleotide sequences 95 p. vivax isolates collected zhejiang
province, china. investigate genetic diversity pvmsp-1, 95
nucleotide sequences pvmsp-1 icb5-6 fragment genotyped analyzed
using dnasp v5, mega software.
results: 95 p. vivax isolates collected zhejiang province either
indigenous cases imported cases different regions around world. a
total 95 sequences ranging 390 460Â bp obtained. 95 sequences 
were genotyped four allele-types (sal i, belem, r-iii r-iv) 17
unique haplotypes. r-iii sal predominant allele-types. the
haplotype diversity (hd) nucleotide diversity (pi) estimated 0.729
and 0.062, indicating pvmsp-1 icb5-6 fragment highest level of
polymorphism due frequent recombination processes single nucleotide
polymorphism. values dn/ds tajima's suggested neutral selection
for pvmsp-1icb5-6 fragment. addition, rare recombinant style r-iv
type identified.
conclusions: study presented high genetic diversity pvmsp-1 marker
among p. vivax strains around world. genetic data valuable for
expanding polymorphism information p. vivax, could helpful for
further study population dynamics tracking origin p. vivax.
