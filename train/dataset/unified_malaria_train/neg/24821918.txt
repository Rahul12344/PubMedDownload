mosquito-borne diseases causing substantial burden mortality, morbidity 
and economic loss many parts world, despite current control efforts,
and new complementary approaches controlling diseases needed. one
promising class new interventions development involves heritable
modification mosquito insertion novel genes nucleus of
wolbachia endosymbionts cytoplasm. released target
population, modifications act reduce one components the
mosquito population's vectorial capacity (e.g. number female mosquitoes,
their longevity ability support development transmission the
pathogen). modifications development designed be
self-limiting, tend disappear time absence of
recurrent releases (and hence similar sterile insect technique, sit), 
whereas modifications designed self-sustaining, spreading through
populations even releases stop (and hence similar traditional
biological control). several successful field trials performed with
aedes mosquitoes, trials helping define appropriate
developmental pathway new class intervention.
