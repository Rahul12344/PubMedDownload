background: plasmodium falciparum developed resistance artemisinin in
southeast asia. mutations p. falciparum kelch-13 (pfk13) gene are
associated artemisinin resistance vitro vivo. investigated 
prevalence mutations pfk13 sporozoite-stage parasites isolated from
the salivary glands anopheles dirus mosquitoes.
methods: mosquitoes caught human-landing catches two locations within 
the khanh phu commune, south-central vietnam. identification anopheles species
was performed based morphological features nucleotide sequence analysis.
sporozoite-infected salivary glands stored filter paper 4-6 °c. 
nested-pcr targeting small subunit ribosomal rna gene used plasmodium
species identification. pfk13 amplified nested pcr, subjected to
nucleotide sequencing.
results: five 33 p. falciparum sporozoite samples carried p553l mutation
at pfk13 locus. mutation recorded previously vietnam, but
not khanh hoa province, surveys k13 polymorphism previously
been carried out.
conclusion: results demonstrate utility mosquito-stage malaria
parasite samples studies molecular epidemiology drug resistance.
