plasmodium vivax (pv) major cause human malaria increasing in
public health importance compared falciparum malaria. pv unique among
human malarias invasion erythrocytes almost solely dependent the
red cell's surface receptor, known duffy blood-group antigen (fy). fy is
an important minor blood-group antigen two immunologically distinct
alleles, referred fy(a) fy(b), resulting single-point mutation.
this mutation occurs within binding domain parasite's red cell
invasion ligand. whether polymorphism affects susceptibility clinical
vivax malaria unknown. show fy(a), compared fy(b),
significantly diminishes binding pv duffy binding protein (pvdbp) the
erythrocyte surface, associated reduced risk clinical pv in
humans. erythrocytes expressing fy(a) 41-50% lower binding compared with
fy(b) cells showed increased ability naturally occurring or
artificially induced antibodies block binding pvdbp surface.
individuals fy(a+b-) phenotype demonstrated 30-80% reduced risk of
clinical vivax, falciparum malaria prospective cohort study the
brazilian amazon. fy(a+b-) phenotype, predominant southeast asian many
american populations, would confer selective advantage vivax malaria.
our results also suggest efficacy pvdbp-based vaccine may differ among 
populations different fy phenotypes.
