novel interventions needed prevent transmission plasmodium
parasites cause malaria. one possible method supply mosquitoes with
antiplasmodial effector proteins bacteria paratransgenesis. mosquitoes
have diverse complement midgut microbiota including gram-negative
bacteria asaia bogorensis. study presents first use asaia sp.
bacteria paratransgenesis p. berghei. identified putative secreted
proteins a. bogorensis genetic screen using alkaline phosphatase gene
fusions. two secreted efficiently: siderophore receptor protein yvtn
beta-propeller repeat protein. siderophore receptor gene fused with
antiplasmodial effector genes including scorpine antimicrobial peptide an
anti-pbs21 scfv-shiva1 immunotoxin. asaia sf2.1 secreting fusion proteins
were fed mosquitoes challenged plasmodium berghei-infected blood.
with effector constructs, significant inhibition parasite
development observed. results provide novel promising
intervention malaria transmission.
