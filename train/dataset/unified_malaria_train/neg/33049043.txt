epigenetic processes eukaryotes play important roles regulation of
gene expression, chromatin structure genome rearrangements. mechanisms such
as chromatin modification (e.g. dna methylation, histone modification) and
non-protein-coding rnas (npc-rnas) well studied animals plants. 
with exception model organisms (e.g. saccharomyces, plasmodium),
much less known epigenetic toolkits across remainder the
eukaryotic tree life. even limited data, previous work suggested the
existence ancient epigenetic toolkit last eukaryotic common ancestor
(leca). use phylotol, taxon-rich phylogenomic pipeline, detect homologs
of epigenetic genes evaluate macroevolutionary patterns among
eukaryotes. addition data genbank, increase taxon sampling from
understudied clades sar (stramenopila, alveolata rhizaria) amoebozoa
by adding new single-cell transcriptomes ciliates, foraminifera testate 
amoebae. focus 118 gene families, 94 involved chromatin modification and
24 involved npc-rna processes based epigenetics literature. results
indicate: 1) presence large number epigenetic gene families leca; 
2) differential conservation among major eukaryotic clades, notable
paucity genes within excavata; 3) punctate distribution epigenetic gene
families species consistent rapid evolution leading gene loss.
together data demonstrate power taxon-rich phylogenomic studies 
illuminating evolutionary patterns scales of > 1 billion years evolution
and suggest macroevolutionary phenomena, genome conflict, have
shaped evolution eukaryotic epigenetic toolkit.
