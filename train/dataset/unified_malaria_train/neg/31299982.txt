background: given central importance anti-malarial drugs treatment 
of malaria, need understand effect plasmodium infection on
the broad spectrum drug metabolizing enzymes. previous studies shown
reduced clearance quinine, treatment plasmodium infection, in
individuals malaria.
methods: hepatic expression large panel drug metabolizing enzymes was
studied livers mice infected strain plasmodium chabaudi 
chabaudi, nonlethal parasite strains mice several features that
model human plasmodium infections. c57bl/6j mice infected p. chabaudi
by intraperitoneal injection infected erythrocytes sacrificed different
times infection. relative hepatic mrna levels various drug metabolizing 
enzymes, cytokines acute phase proteins measured reverse
transcriptase-real time pcr. relative levels cytochrome p450 proteins were
measured western blotting ir-dye labelled antibodies. pharmacokinetics of
5 prototypic cytochrome p450 substrate drugs measured cassette dosing and
high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. results were
analysed manova post hoc univariate analysis variance.
results: great majority enzyme mrnas down-regulated, the
greatest effects occurring peak parasitaemia 8Â days post infection.
protein levels cytochrome p450 enzymes cyp 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 3a 4a
subfamilies also down-regulated. several distinct groups differing 
temporal patterns regulation identified. cassette dosing study
revealed peak parasitaemia, clearances caffeine, bupropion,
tolbutamide midazolam markedly reduced 60-70%.
conclusions: findings model uncomplicated human malaria suggest
that changes drug clearance condition may sufficient magnitude
to cause significant alterations exposure response anti-malarial drugs 
and co-medications.
