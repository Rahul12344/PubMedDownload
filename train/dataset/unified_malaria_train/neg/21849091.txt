background: pyronaridine (pn) chloroquine (cq) structurally related
anti-malarial drugs primarily mode action. however, pn is
effective several multidrug-resistant lines plasmodium falciparum,
including cq resistant lines, suggestive important operational differences
between two drugs.
methods: synchronized trophozoite stage cultures p. falciparum strain k1 (cq
resistant) exposed 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50) pn cq, and
parasites harvested culture 4 24 hours exposure. global
transcriptional changes effected drug treatment investigated using dna
microarrays.
results: 4 h drug exposure, pn induced greater degree of
transcriptional perturbation (61 differentially expressed features) cq (10
features). genes found respond 24 h treatments drugs,
and 461 features found significantly responsive one drugs
across treatment conditions. filtering employed remove features
unrelated primary drug action, specifically features representing genes
developmentally regulated, secondary stress/death related processes sexual
stage development. significant gene ontologies represented among 46 
remaining features filtering relate host exported proteins from
multi-gene families.
conclusions: malaria parasite's molecular responses pn cq treatment
are similar terms genes pathways affected. however, pn appears to
exert rapid response cq. faster action pn may explain pn
is efficacious cq, particularly cq resistant isolates. in
agreement several microarray studies drug action parasite,
it possible, however, discern mechanism drug action the
drug-responsive genes.
