the central role erythrocyte invasion plays plasmodium falciparum
survival reproduction makes process attractive target therapeutic
or vaccine development. however, multiple invasion-related genes with
complementary overlapping functions afford parasite plasticity to
vary ligands used invasion, leading phenotypic variation immune
evasion. overcoming challenge posed redundant ligands requires deeper
understanding conditions select variant phenotypes molecular 
mediators. host factors including receptor heterogeneity acquired
immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, previously
shown host-independent changes invasion phenotype achieved by
continuous culturing w2mef dd2 p. falciparum strains moving
suspension opposed static conditions. here, used highly
biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach identify the
molecular signatures variation associated phenotype switch. data 
show increased expression particular invasion-related genes switched
parasites, well large number genes encoding proteins either
exported form part export machinery. genes markedly
increased expression included members erythrocyte binding antigens (eba), 
reticulocyte binding homologues (rh), surface associated interspersed proteins
(surfin), exported protein family 1 (epf1) plasmodium helical interspersed
sub-telomeric (phist) gene families. data indicate changes expression a
repertoire genes previously associated erythrocyte invasion
phenotypes, suggesting possibility moving suspension culture may also
select traits.
