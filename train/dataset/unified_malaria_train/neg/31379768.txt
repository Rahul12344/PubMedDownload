the malaria development mosquito midgut complex process results 
in considerable parasite losses. mosquito gut microbiota influences the
outcome pathogen infection mosquitoes, underlying mechanisms
through gut symbiotic bacteria affect vector competence remain elusive.
here, identified two serratia strains (y1 j1) isolated field-caught
female anopheles sinensis china assessed effect plasmodium
development an. stephensi. colonization an. stephensi midgut serratia y1
significantly renders mosquito resistant plasmodium berghei infection,
while serratia j1 impact parasite development. parasite inhibition by
serratia y1 induced activation mosquito immune system.
genome-wide transcriptomic analysis rna-seq shows similar pattern midgut 
gene expression response serratia y1 j1 sugar-fed mosquitoes.
however, 24 h blood ingestion, serratia y1 modulates midgut genes than
serratia j1 including c-type lectins (ctls), clip serine proteases 
immune effectors. furthermore, silencing several serratia y1-induced
anti-plasmodium factors like thioester-containing protein 1 (tep1),
fibrinogen immunolectin 9 (fbn9) leucine-rich repeat protein lrrd7 rescue 
parasite oocyst development presence serratia y1, suggesting these
factors modulate serratia y1-mediated anti-plasmodium effect. study
enhances understanding gut bacteria influence mosquito-plasmodium
interactions.
