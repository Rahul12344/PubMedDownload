background: effective malaria control relies accurate identification 
anopheles mosquitoes responsible transmission plasmodium parasites.
anopheles oswaldoi s.l. incriminated malaria vector colombia and
some localities brazil, ubiquitously throughout neotropical range.
this evidence together variable morphological characters genetic
differences supports an. oswaldoi s.l. compromises species complex. the
recent fully integrated redescription an. oswaldoi s.s. provides solid
taxonomic foundation molecularly determine members the
complex.
methods: dna sequences second internal transcribed spacer (its2 - rdna) (n
= 192) barcoding region cytochrome oxidase gene (coi - mtdna) (n
= 110) generated 255 specimens an. oswaldoi s.l. 33 localities:
brazil (8 localities, including lectotype series an. oswaldoi), ecuador
(4), colombia (17), trinidad tobago (1), peru (3). coi sequences were
analyzed employing kimura-two-parameter model (k2p), bayesian analysis
(mrbayes), mixed yule-coalescent model (myc, delimitation clusters) and
tcs genealogies.
results: separate combined analysis coi its2 data sets
unequivocally supported four separate species: two previously determined (an.
oswaldoi s.s. an. oswaldoi b) two newly designated species the
oswaldoi complex (an. oswaldoi an. sp. nr. konderi). coi intra- and
inter-specific genetic distances four taxa non-overlapping,
averaging 0.012 (0.007 0.020) 0.052 (0.038 0.064), respectively. the
concurring four clusters delineated mrbayes myc, four independent tcs 
networks, strongly confirmed separate species status. addition, an.
konderi sallum regarded unique respect above. despite
initially included outgroup taxon, species falls well within the
examined taxa, suggesting combined analysis taxa would most
appropriate.
conclusions: novel data retrospective comparison available coi and
its2 dna sequences, evidence shown support separate species status of
an. oswaldoi s.s., an. oswaldoi an. oswaldoi b, least two species in
the closely related an. konderi complex (an. sp. nr. konderi, an. konderi of
sallum). although an. oswaldoi s.s. never implicated malaria
transmission, an. oswaldoi b confirmed vector new species an.
oswaldoi an. sp. nr. konderi circumstantially implicated, likely
acting secondary vectors.
