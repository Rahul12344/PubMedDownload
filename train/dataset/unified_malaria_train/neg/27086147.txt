objective: find host gene expression profiles malarial infection.
methods: time-course microarray analysis peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells focusing malaria pathogenesis performed.
results: up-regulation coagulation-related genes, heat shock proteins,
glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, vacuolar h(+)-atpases found 
acute febrile malaria. early malaria, prior detectable parasitemia, cd36
and icam1 up-regulated. acute malaria, correlation between
il-1β heat shock proteins. cd163, hemoglobin scavenger receptor, was
up-regulated acute malaria potentially facilitate free hemoglobin up-take
by leukocytes. acute malaria, high mafb gene expression negatively
correlated hemoglobin platelet counts. consistent hemoglobin
down-regulation, peripheral red blood cell counts tended increase acute
malaria. up-regulations red blood cell leukocyte binding mediators like
cd36, icam1, thrombospondin, thrombomodulin may contribute the
pathogenesis cerebral malaria. similarly, up-regulation correlated
glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter h(+)-atpases may contribute the
hypoglycemia metabolic acidosis frequently observed serious malaria
patients. overall gender effects gene expression profiles male and
female apparent, except hemoglobins significantly
down-regulated male versus female, suggesting males prone to
malaria-related anemia.
conclusions: leukocyte gene expression profiles explain pathogenesis of
malarial complication fever, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, anemia,
and coagulopathy.
