chemical genetics defined study biological systems using small
molecule tools. cell permeable selective small molecules modulate gene
product function rapidly, reversibly administered conditionally in
either cellular organismal context. small molecule approach provides
exacting temporal quantitative control therefore extremely powerful
tool dissecting biological processes. tutorial review written
to introduce subject broad audience highlights recent developments
within field four key areas biology: modulating protein-protein
interactions, malaria research, hepatitis c virus research, disrupting rna
interference pathways.
