genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum intimately associated with
morbidity, mortality malaria control strategies. therefore imperative
to study genetic makeup population structure parasite endemic
areas. kong mong tha, isolated village western thailand, majority of
p. falciparum infections asymptomatic. study investigated
complexity infections single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) p.
falciparum population kong mong tha, compared results those
previously obtained mae sod, northwestern thailand, majority of
infections symptomatic. using pcr-based determination 5' merozoite
surface protein 1 gene (msp1) recombinant types, found 39% 59 p.
falciparum isolates kong mong tha multiple 5' recombinant types a
mean number 1.54. values much lower obtained mae
sod: 96% multiple infections mean number 3.61. analysis of
full-length sequences two housekeeping genes, p-type ca(2+)-transporting
atpase gene (n=33) plus adenylosuccinate lyase gene (n=33), three vaccine
candidate antigen genes, msp1 (n=26), circumsporozoite protein gene, csp
(n=30) apical membrane antigen 1 gene, ama 1 (n=32), revealed all
of genes within-population snp diversity similar levels kong
mong tha mae sod, suggesting extent moi clinical
manifestations malaria strongly associated genetic diversity.
additionally, detect significant genetic differentiation the
two parasite populations, estimated wright's fixation index of
inter-population variance allele frequencies, suggesting gene flow
prevented formation population structuring. thus, study highlights
unique features p. falciparum populations thailand. implications of
these finding discussed.
