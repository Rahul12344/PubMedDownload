cell-cell communication important mechanism information exchange
promoting cell survival control features population density
and differentiation. determined plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood 
cells directly communicate parasites within population using
exosome-like vesicles capable delivering genes. importantly,
communication via exosome-like vesicles promotes differentiation sexual forms 
at rate suggests signaling involved. furthermore, have
identified p. falciparum protein, pfptp2, plays key role efficient
communication. study reveals previously unidentified pathway p.
falciparum biology critical survival host transmission to
mosquitoes. identifies pathway development agents block
parasite transmission human host mosquito.
