background: although larviciding reduce number outdoor biting malaria 
vector mosquitoes, may help prevent residual malaria transmission, the
current larvicide repertoire faced great challenges sustainability.
the identification new effective, economical, biorational larvicides could
facilitate maintenance expansion practice larviciding integrated
malaria vector mosquito control programmes. interfering rna molecules represent a
novel class larvicides untapped potential sustainable mosquito
control. investigation tested hypothesis short interfering rna
molecules used mosquito larvicides.
results: small interfering rna (sirna) screen larval lethal genes
identified sirnas corresponding anopheles gambiae suppressor actin
(sac1), leukocyte receptor complex member (lrc), offtrack (otk) genes.
saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) engineered produce short hairpin 
rnas (shrnas) silencing genes. feeding larvae engineered
yeasts resulted silenced target gene expression, severe loss neural
synapses larval brain, high levels larval mortality. larvicidal
activities yeast interfering rna larvicides retained following heat
inactivation drying yeast user-friendly tablet formulations 
induced 100% larval mortality laboratory trials.
conclusions: ready-to-use dried inactivated yeast interfering rna larvicide
tablets may someday effective inexpensive addition malaria mosquito 
control programmes valuable, biorational tool addressing residual
malaria transmission.
