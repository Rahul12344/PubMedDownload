freshwater snail physa acuta considered important invasive species
and medical mollusc. field investigation shown snail could survive 
better snails polluted water bodies. understand immune
mechanisms p. acuta, suppression subtractive hybridization hepatopancreas cdna
library constructed bacterial challenge. study, a
full-length cdna novel goose-type lysozyme (palysg) identified from
p. acuta est race technique. conservative structure domains share high
homology molluscan g-type lysozymes including slt domain, the
substrate binding sites, catalytic residues, three alpha-helices structures
and six molluscan specific cysteines. meanwhile, palysg first record of
goose-type lysozyme gastropoda. real-time pcr indicated palysg mrna had
been expressed significantly high levels hepatopancreas 8-48 h. palysg 
recombinant protein displayed lytic activity g-type lysozyme other
organisms micrococcus lysodikicus.
