background: new approaches delivering insecticides need developed to
improve malaria vector control. insecticidal durable wall lining (dl) net
wall hangings (nwh) novel alternatives indoor residual spraying 
be produced long-lasting format. non-pyrethroid versions could used in
combination long-lasting insecticidal nets improved control and
management insecticide resistant vector populations.
methods: experimental hut trials carried valley du kou, burkina faso 
to evaluate efficacy pirimiphos methyl treated dl nwh either alone 
in combination llins pyrethroid resistant anopheles gambiae ss.
comparison made pyrethroid dl. mosquitoes genotyped kdr and
ace-1r resistant genes investigate insecticide resistance management
potential combination.
results: overall kdr ace-1(r) allele frequencies 0.95 0.01
respectively. mortality p-methyl dl nwh alone higher with
pyrethroid dl alone (>95% vs 40%; p<0.001). combining pyrethroid dl llins
did show improvement mortality (48%) compared llin alone (44%)
(p>0.1). combining p-methyl dl nwh llins reduced biting rates
significantly (8-9%) compared p-methyl dl nwh alone (>40%) killed 
an gambiae entered huts. mosquitoes bearing ace-1(r) gene 
likely survive huts p-methyl dl alone (p<0.03) whereas resistant
and susceptible genotypes killed combination.
conclusion: p-methyl dl nwh outperformed pyrethroid dl. combining p-methyl dl
and nwh llins could provide significant epidemiological benefits a
vector population resistant pyrethroids susceptible to
organophosphates. evidence single intervention would select
kdr ace-1(r) resistance genes combination intervention might select
less strongly. technology bind organophosphates plastic wall lining would
be worth developing.
