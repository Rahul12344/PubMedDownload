accumulating behavioural data indicate aggregation pheromones may mediate
the formation maintenance mosquito swarms. however, chemical cues possibly
luring mosquitoes swarms adequately investigated, likely
molecular incitants complex reproductive behaviours remain unknown. here
we show males important malaria vector species anopheles arabiensis
and an. gambiae produce release aggregation pheromones attract
individuals swarm enhance mating success. found males 
species released significantly higher amounts 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (acetoin), 
6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (sulcatone), octanal, nonanal decanal swarming
in laboratory. feeding males stable-isotope-labelled glucose revealed
that males produced five compounds. blend composed synthetic
analogues swarming odours proved highly attractive virgin males and
females species laboratory conditions substantially increased
mating five african malaria vectors (an. gambiae, an. coluzzii, an.
arabiensis, an. merus an. funestus) semi-field experiments. results

metabolic genes physiology behavioural regulation vectors.
these identified aggregation pheromones great potential exploitation
against highly dangerous insects. manipulating pheromones could
increase efficacy malaria-vector control programmes.
