single genes often subject alternative splicing, generates
alternative mature mrnas. phenomenon widespread animals, observed 
in 90% human genes. recent data suggest may also common in
apicomplexa. parasites small genomes, economy dna is
evolutionarily favoured phylum. investigated mechanism of
alternative splicing toxoplasma gondii, identified localized
tgsr3, homologue asf/sf2 (alternative-splicing factor/splicing factor 2, a
serine-arginine-rich, sr protein) subnuclear compartment. addition, we
conditionally overexpressed protein, deleterious growth.
qrt-pcr used confirm perturbation splicing known
alternatively-spliced gene. performed high-throughput rna-seq determine the
extent splicing modulated protein. current rna-seq algorithms are
poorly suited compact parasite genomes, hence complemented existing
tools writing new program, geneguillotine, addresses deficiency by
segregating overlapping reads distinct genes. order identify the
extent alternative splicing, released another program, junctionjuror, 
detects changes intron junctions. using program, identified 2000
genes constitutively alternatively spliced t. gondii. overexpressing
the splice regulator tgsr3 perturbed alternative splicing 1000 genes.
