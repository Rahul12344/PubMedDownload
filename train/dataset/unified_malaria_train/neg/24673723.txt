divergent selection based aquatic larval ecology likely factor the
recent isolation two broadly sympatric morphologically identical african
mosquito species, malaria vectors anopheles gambiae an. coluzzii.
population-based genome scans revealed numerous candidate regions recent 
positive selection, provided clues genetic mechanisms
underlying behavioural physiological divergence two species,
phenotypes remain obscure. uncover possible genetic
mechanisms, compared global transcriptional profiles natural and
experimental populations using gene-based microarrays. larvae sampled as
second fourth instars natural populations around city of
yaoundé, capital cameroon, two species segregate along gradient of
urbanization. functional enrichment analysis differentially expressed genes
revealed an. coluzzii--the species breeds stable, biotically
complex potentially polluted urban water bodies--overexpresses genes
implicated detoxification immunity relative an. gambiae, breeds
in ephemeral relatively depauperate pools puddles suburbs and
rural areas. moreover, data suggest overexpression an. coluzzii 
is transient result induction xenobiotics larval habitat, 
an inherent presumably adaptive response repeatedly encountered
environmental stressors. finally, find significant overlap the
differentially expressed loci previously identified genomic regions recent
positive selection, suggesting transcriptome divergence regulated by
trans-acting factors rather cis-acting elements.
