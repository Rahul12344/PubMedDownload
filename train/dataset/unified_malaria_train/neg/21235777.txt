background: fulani widely spread african ethnic group characterized by
lower susceptibility plasmodium falciparum, clinical malaria morbidity and
higher rate lactase persistence compared sympatric tribes. lactase
non-persistence, often called lactose intolerance, normal condition 
lactase activity intestinal wall declines weaning. lactase
persistence, common europe, certain african people traditions of
raising cattle, caused polymorphisms enhancer region approximately
14 kb upstream lactase gene.
methods: evaluate relationship malaria lactase persistence
genotypes, 400 bp region surrounding main european c/t-13910 polymorphism
upstream lactase gene sequenced. dna samples used study
originated 162 fulani 79 dogon individuals mali.
results: among 79 dogon one heterozygote lactase enhancer
polymorphism detected, whereas others homozygous ancestral c
allele. among fulani, main european polymorphism locus c/t-13910 was
by far common polymorphism, allele frequency 37%. three other
single-nucleotide polymorphisms found allele frequencies 3.7%, 1.9% 
and 0.6% each. novel dna polymorphism t/c-13906 seen six heterozygous 
fulani. among fulani lactase non-persistence cc genotypes the
c/t-13910 locus, 24% malaria parasites detectable microscopy compared to
18% lactase persistent genotypes (p = 0.29). pooling lactase enhancer
polymorphisms common presumptive genotype gave 28% microscopy positives 
non-persistent 17% others (p = 0.11).
conclusions: plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia asymptomatic fulani more
common individuals lactase non-persistence genotypes, difference
is statistically significant. potential immunoprotective properties of
dietary cow milk reason partial malaria resistance fulani warrant
further investigation.
