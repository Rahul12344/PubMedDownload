tick saliva facilitates tick feeding infection host. gene expression
analysis tick salivary glands tissues involved host-pathogen
interactions revealed wide range bioactive tick proteins. transcriptomic
analysis milestone field recently enhanced by
next-generation sequencing (ngs). furthermore, application quantitative
proteomics ticks unknown genomes provided deeper insights the
molecular mechanisms underlying tick hematophagy, pathogen transmission, and
tick-host-pathogen interactions. review current knowledge the
transcriptomics proteomics tick tissues systems-biology perspective
and discuss future challenges field.
