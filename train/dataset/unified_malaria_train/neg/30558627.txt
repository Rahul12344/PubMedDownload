background: plasmodium falciparum malaria remains major health challenge in
nigeria despite global decline incidence mortality rates. although
significant progress made preventing transmission p.
falciparum controlling spread infection, much done 
in area proper monitoring, surveillance parasite, investigating the
population dynamics drug resistance profiling parasite are
important eventual eradication. polymorphic loci msp1, msp2 and/or
glurp genes microsatellites traditionally used characterize p.
falciparum population structure various parts nigeria. lack of
standardization interpretation results, well inability of
these methods distinguish closely related parasites, remains limitation of
these techniques. conversely, recently developed 24 single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp)-based molecular barcode assay possibility of
differentiating closely related parasites offer additional
information determining population diversity p. falciparum within and
between parasite populations. study therefore aimed defining the
population diversity p. falciparum two localities nigeria
using snps barcode technique.
methods: 24-snp high-resolution melt (hrm) barcode assay msp2 genotyping 
was used investigate intra inter population diversity parasite
population two urban cities nigeria.
results: based snp barcode analysis, polygenomic malaria infections were
observed 17.9% 13.5% population enugu ibadan, respectively,
while msp2 analyses showed 21% 19.4% polygenomic infections enugu and
ibadan, respectively. low levels genetic diversity (π) 0.328 0.318 were
observed enugu ibadan parasite populations, respectively, fst
value 0.02 (p = 0.055) obtained genetic divergence both
populations considered.
conclusions: 24-snp barcode assay effective analysing p. falciparum
population diversity. study also showed p. falciparum populations in
enugu ibadan degree intra-population diversity, low
divergence population. low degree polygenomic infections were
also observed two parasite populations unlike previous years. maybe
as result effect artemisinin-based combination therapy (act),
long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (llitns) intermittent preventive
treatments study populations.
