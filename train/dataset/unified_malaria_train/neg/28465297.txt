endemic burkitt lymphoma (ebl) common pediatric cancer in
malaria-endemic equatorial africa nearly always contains epstein-barr virus
(ebv), unlike sporadic burkitt lymphoma (sbl) occurs lower incidence 
in developed countries. given differences variable clinical
presentation outcomes, sought understand pathogenesis by
investigating transcriptomes using rna sequencing (rnaseq) multiple primary 
ebl tumors compared sbl tumors. within ebl tumors, minimal expression
differences found based on: anatomical presentation site, in-hospital
survival rates, ebv genome type, suggesting ebl tumors homogeneous
without marked subtypes. outstanding difference detected using surrogate
variable analysis significantly decreased expression key genes 
immunoproteasome complex (psmb9/β1i, psmb10/β2i, psmb8/β5i, psme2/pa28β) in
ebl tumors carrying type 2 ebv compared type 1 ebv. second, comparison
with previously published pediatric sbl specimens, majority expression
and pathway differences related pten/pi3k/mtor signaling pathway and
was correlated strongly ebv status rather geographic designation. 
third, common mutations observed significantly less frequently ebl tumors
harboring ebv type 1, mutation frequencies similar tumors ebv
type 2 without ebv. addition previously reported genes, set of
new genes mutated bl, including tfap4, msh6, prrc2c, bcl7a, foxo1, plcg2,
prkdc, rad50, rprd2, identified. overall, data establish ebv,
particularly ebv type 1, supports bl oncogenesis, alleviating need for
certain driver mutations human genome.implications: genomic mutational
analyses burkitt lymphoma tumors identify key differences based viral
content clinical outcomes suggesting new avenues development of
prognostic molecular biomarkers therapeutic interventions.
