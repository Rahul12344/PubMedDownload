background: premise diminishing parasite genetic diversity following 
the reduction malaria incidence, analysis polymorphic antigenic markers
may provide important information impact malaria control local
parasite populations. evaluated genetic diversity plasmodium vivax
apical membrane antigen 1 (pvama1) gene parasite population the
china-myanmar border compared global p. vivax populations.
methods: performed evolutionary analysis examine genetic diversity,
natural selection, population differentiation 73 pvama1 sequences acquired
from china-myanmar border well 615 publically available pvama1
sequences seven global p. vivax populations.
results: total 308 pvama1 haplotypes identified among global p.
vivax isolates. overall nucleotide diversity pvama1 gene among 73
china-myanmar border parasite isolates 0.008 41 haplotypes being
identified (hd = 0.958). domain (di) harbored majority (26/33) the
polymorphic sites. mcdonald kreitman test showed significant positive
selection across ectodomain di pvama1. fixation index (f st ) 
estimation china-myanmar border, thailand (0.01) myanmar (0.10)
showed slight geographical genetic differentiation. notably, sal-i
haplotype detected analyzed global isolates, whereas the
belem strain restricted thai population. detected mutations are
mapped outside overlapped region predicted b-cell epitopes and
intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions.
conclusions: study revealed high levels genetic diversity pvama1 in
the p. vivax parasite population china-myanmar border di displaying
stronger diversifying selection domains. low levels of
population subdivision among parasite populations greater mekong
subregion.
