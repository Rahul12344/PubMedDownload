background: intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy (iptp) with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) decreases adverse effects malaria during
pregnancy. zambia implemented iptp-sp programme 2003. emergence of
sp-resistant plasmodium falciparum threatens strategy. quintuple mutant 
haplotype (substitutions n51i, c59r, s108n dhfr a437g k540e dhps
genes), associated sp treatment failure non-pregnant patients with
malaria. study examined efficacy iptp-sp presence quintuple
mutant among pregnant women mansa, zambia.
methods: mansa, area high malaria transmission, hiv-negative pregnant 
women presenting two antenatal clinics 1st dose iptp-sp with
asymptomatic parasitaemia enrolled microscopy parasitaemia done 
weekly five weeks. outcomes parasitological failure adequate
parasitological response (no parasitaemia follow-up). polymerase chain
reaction assays employed distinguish recrudescence reinfection, 
identify molecular markers sp resistance. survival analysis included who
had reinfection incomplete follow-up (missed least one follow-up).
results: 109 women included study, 58 (53%) completed all
follow-up, 34 (31%) incomplete follow-up, 17 (16%) lost follow-up
after day 0. complete follow-up, 15 (26%, 95% confidence
interval [ci] [16-38]) parasitological failure. 92 women included 
the survival analysis, median age 20 years (interquartile range [iqr] 18-22),
median gestational age 22 weeks (iqr range 20-24), 57% primigravid. 
there difference time failure primigravid versus multigravid
women. 84 women complete haplotype data aforementioned loci
of dhfr dhps genes, 53 (63%, 95% ci [50-70]) quintuple mutants (two
with additional mutation a581g dhps). among women complete
follow-up quintuple mutants, 22% parasitological failure versus 0%
without (p = 0.44).
conclusions: underpowered, study found 26% failure rates sp given
the moderate prevalence quintuple mutant haplotype. despite presence
of resistance, sp retained efficacy clearing parasites pregnant women,
and may remain viable option iptp zambia.
