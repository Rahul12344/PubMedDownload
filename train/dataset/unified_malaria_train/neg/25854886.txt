sexual reproduction obligate step life cycle many parasites,
including causative agents malaria (plasmodium). mixed-species infections 
are common nature consequently, interactions heterospecific
gametes occur. given importance managing gene flow across parasite
populations, remarkably little understood reproductive isolation
between species maintained. use rodent malaria parasites p. berghei and
p. yoelii investigate ecology mixed-species mating groups, identify
proteins involved pre-zygotic barriers, examine evolution.
specifically, show (i) hybridization occurs, low frequency; (ii)
hybridization reaches high levels female gametes lack surface proteins
p230 p48/45, demonstrating proteins key pre-zygotic
reproductive isolation; (iii) asymmetric reproductive interference occurs, 
the fertility p. berghei gametes reduced presence p. yoelii and
(iv) expected gamete recognition proteins, strong positive selection acts 
on region p230 p47 (p48/45 paralogue). p230 p48/45 leading
candidates interventions block malaria transmission. results suggest
that depending viability hybrids, applying interventions to
populations mixed-species infections occur could either facilitate or
hinder malaria control.
