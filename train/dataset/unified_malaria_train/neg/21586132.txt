background: malaria still represents significant public health problem in
china, cases dramatically increased central china 2001.
antifolate resistance plasmodium vivax caused point mutations genes
encoding dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps). 
in study, used direct sequencing investigate genetic variation in
pvdhfr malaria patients' samples central china.
results: among samples, 21.4% wild-type, whereas mutations were
detected three codons (58, 61 117) including single mutant (34.6%) and
double mutants (43.8%). prevalent mutant allele one double 
mutation codons 58 117 (24.6%). three types single mutation (s58r, t61m
and s117n) found 2.1%, 11.8% 20.9% parasite isolates,
respectively. four p. vivax parasite populations central china also
differed pvdhfr allele frequencies.
conclusions: study suggested p. vivax central china may be
relatively susceptible pyrimethamine. also highlights genotyping the
pvdhfr genes remains useful tool monitor emergence spread p.
vivax pyrimethamine resistance.
