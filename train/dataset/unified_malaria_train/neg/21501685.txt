growing problems pyrethroid resistance anopheles funestus intensified 
efforts identify alternative insecticides. many agrochemicals target gaba 
receptors, cross-resistance dieldrin resistance may preclude their
introduction. dieldrin resistance detected an. funestus populations from
west (burkina faso) central (cameroon) africa, populations east
(uganda) southern africa (mozambique malawi) fully susceptible to
this insecticide. partial sequencing dieldrin target site, the
γ-aminobutyric acid (gaba) receptor, identified two amino acid substitutions,
a296s v327i. a296s mutation associated dieldrin resistance 
in species. v327i mutations detected resistant sample from
burkina faso cameroon consistently associated a296s
substitution. full-length an. funestus gaba-receptor gene, amplified
by rt-pcr, generated sequence 1674 bp encoding 557 amino acid protein
in an. funestus 98% similarity anopheles gambiae. two diagnostic 
assays developed genotype a296s mutation (pyrosequencing and
pcr-rflp), use assays revealed high frequency resistant
allele burkina faso (60%) cameroon (82%), moderate level benin (16%)
while low frequency absence mutation observed respectively in
uganda (7.5%) 0% malawi mozambique. distribution rdl(r)
mutation an. funestus populations africa suggests extensive barriers to
gene flow populations different regions.
