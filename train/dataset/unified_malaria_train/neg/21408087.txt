the three-gene apl1 locus encodes essential components mosquito immune
defense malaria parasites. apl1 originally identified lies
within mapped qtl conferring vector mosquito anopheles gambiae natural
resistance human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, apl1 genes
have subsequently shown involved defense several species of
plasmodium. here, examine molecular population genetic variation apl1
gene cluster spatially temporally diverse west african collections a.
gambiae. locus extremely polymorphic, showing evidence adaptive
evolutionary maintenance genetic variation. hypothesize this
variability aids defense genetically diverse pathogens, including
plasmodium. variation apl1 highly structured across geographic temporal
subpopulations. particular, diversity exceptionally high rainy
season, malaria transmission rates peak. much less allelic
diversity observed dry season mosquito population sizes and
malaria transmission rates low. apl1 diversity weakly stratified the
polymorphic 2la chromosomal inversion strongly subdivided the
m "molecular forms." find evidence recent selective sweep has
occurred apl1 locus form mosquitoes only. independently reported 
observation similar m-form restricted sweep tep1 locus, whose product
physically interacts apl1c, suggests epistatic selection may act on
these two loci causing sweep coordinately.
