protozoan parasites, including apicomplexan pathogens plasmodium falciparum
(which causes malaria) toxoplasma gondii (which causes toxoplasmosis), infect
millions people worldwide represent major human disease burdens. despite
their prevalence, therapeutic strategies treat infections caused these
parasites remain limited threatened emergence drug resistance, 
highlighting need identification novel drug targets. recently,
homologues core autophagy proteins, including atg8 atg3, were
identified many protozoan parasites. importantly, components atg8
conjugation system facilitate lipidation atg8 required both
canonical parasite-specific functions essential parasite
viability. structural characterization p. falciparum atg3-atg8
(pfatg3-atg8) interaction led identification compounds block
this interaction. additionally, many compounds inhibit p. falciparum
growth vitro, demonstrating viability pathway drug target.
given essential role atg8 lipidation pathway toxoplasma, sought 
to determine whether three pfatg3-atg8 interaction inhibitors identified the
medicines malaria venture malaria box exerted similar inhibitory effect 
toxoplasma three inhibitors blocked toxoplasma replication vitro 
submicromolar concentrations, inhibit t. gondii atg8 (tgatg8)
lipidation. rather, high concentrations two compounds induced tgatg8 
lipidation fragmentation parasite mitochondrion, similar the
effects seen following starvation monensin-induced autophagy. additionally,
we report one pfatg3-atg8 interaction inhibitors induces toxoplasma
egress provide evidence mediated increase intracellular
calcium response drug treatment.
