background: transcriptional responses small molecules provide insights
into drug mode action (moa). capacity human malaria parasite,
plasmodium falciparum, respond specifically transcriptional perturbations
has unclear based past approaches. here, present extensive
profiling date parasite's transcriptional responsiveness thirty-one 
chemically functionally diverse small molecules.
methods: exposed two laboratory strains human malaria parasite p.
falciparum brief treatments thirty-one chemically functionally diverse 
small molecules associated biological effects across multiple pathways based
on various levels evidence. investigated impact chemical composition
and moa gene expression similarities arise perturbations by
various compounds. determine target biological pathways small
molecule, developed novelÂ framework encoding small molecule effects a
spectra biological processes go functions enriched the
differentially expressed genes given small molecule perturbation.
results: find small molecules associated similar transcriptional
responses contain similar chemical features, and/ shared moa. the
approach also revealed complex relationships drugs biological
pathways missed exisiting approaches. example, approach 
was able partition small molecule responses drug-specific effects versus 
non-specific effects.
conclusions: work provides new framework linking transcriptional
responses drug moa p. falciparum generalized same
purpose organisms.
