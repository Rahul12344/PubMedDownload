generative cell specific 1 (gcs1) one transmission blocking vaccine
(tbv) candidate antigens, expressed surface male gametocytes
and gametes plasmodium species. since antigenic diversity could inhibit the
successful development malaria vaccine, crucial determine the
diversity gcs1 gene global malaria-endemic areas. therefore, gene diversity
and selection gcs1 gene analyzed iranian plasmodium vivax isolates
(n=52) compared corresponding sequences worldwide clinical p.
vivax isolates available plasmodb database. totally 12 snps detected in
the pvgcs1 sequences compared sal-1 sequence. five 12 snps including
three synonymous (t797c, g1559a, g1667t) two amino acid replacements
(y133s q634p) detected iranian pvgcs1 sequences. according four
amino acid replacements (y133s, n575s, q634p d637n) observed world
pvgcs1 sequences, totally 5 pvgcs1 haplotypes detected world, that
three observed iranian isolates including pvgcs-a (133s/634q,
92.3%), pvgcs-b (133y/634q, 5.8%), pvgcs-c (133s/634p, 1.9%). overall
nucleotide diversity (π) 52 sequences iranian pvgcs1 gene was
0.00018±0.00006, value dn-ds (-0.00031) negative, however, was
not statistically significant. comparison global isolates, iranian and
png pvgcs1 sequences lowest nucleotide haplotype diversity, the
highest nucleotide haplotype diversity observed china population.
moreover, epitope prediction antigen showed b-cell epitopes were
located conserved regions. however, q634p (in one iranian isolate) d637n
(observed thailand, china, vietnam north korea) mutations involved 
predicted iurs. obtained results study could used development
of pvgcs1 based malaria vaccine.
