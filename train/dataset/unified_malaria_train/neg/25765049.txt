background: paradigm resistance evolution chemotherapeutic agents is
that key coding mutation specific gene drives resistance particular
drug. case resistance anti-malarial drug chloroquine (cq), a
specific mutation transporter pfcrt associated resistance. here,
we apply series analytical steps gene expression data lab and
leverage 3 independent datasets identify pfcrt-interacting genes. resulting
networks provide insights pfcrt's biological functions regulation, as
well divergent phenotypic effects allelic variants different
genetic backgrounds.
results: identify pfcrt-interacting genes, analyze pfcrt co-expression
networks 2 phenotypic states - cq-resistant (cqr) cq-sensitive (cqs)
recombinant progeny clones - using computational approach prioritizes gene
interactions functional regulatory relationships. phenotypic
states, pfcrt co-expressed gene sets associated hemoglobin metabolism,
consistent cq's expected mode action. predict drivers of
co-expression divergence, integrate topological relationships the
co-expression networks available high confidence protein-protein interaction
data. analysis identifies 3 transcriptional regulators apiap2
family histone acetylation potential mediators divergences. we
validate predicted divergences dna mismatch repair histone acetylation
by measuring effects small molecule inhibitors recombinant progeny
clones combined quantitative trait locus (qtl) mapping.
conclusions: work demonstrates utility differential co-expression
viewed network framework uncover functional regulatory divergence 
phenotypically distinct parasites. pfcrt-associated co-expression cq
resistant progeny highlights cqr-specific gene relationships possible
targeted intervention strategies. approaches outlined readily
generalized parasite populations drug resistances.
