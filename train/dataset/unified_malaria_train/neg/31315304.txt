malaria significant public health problem ghana. seasonal malaria
chemoprevention (smc) using combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and
amodiaquine implemented since 2015 northern ghana malaria
transmission intense seasonal. study, estimated prevalence 
of asymptomatic p. falciparum carriers three ecological zones ghana, and
compared sensitivity specificity different molecular methods in
identifying asymptomatic infections. moreover, examined frequency of
mutations pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps relate ongoing smc. 
total 535 asymptomatic schoolchildren screened microscopy pcr (18s
rrna tare-2) methods. among samples, 28.6% detected positive by
18s nested pcr, whereas 19.6% detected microscopy. high pcr-based
asymptomatic prevalence observed north (51%) compared the
central (27.8%) south (16.9%). prevalence of
pfdhfr-n51i/c59r/s108n/pfdhps-a437g quadruple mutant associated with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance significantly higher north 
smc implemented. compared 18s rrna, tare-2 serves sensitive
molecular marker detecting submicroscopic asymptomatic infections high and
low transmission settings. findings establish baseline monitoring p. 
falciparum prevalence resistance response smc time.
