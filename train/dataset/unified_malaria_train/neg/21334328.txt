plasmepsins, family aspartic proteases plasmodium species, known to
participate wide variety cellular processes essential parasite
survival. therefore, plasmepsins malaria parasites recognized as
attractive antimalarial drug targets. although plasmepsins p. falciparum
have extensively characterized, plasmepsins p. vivax currently
not well known. expand understanding plasmepsins p. vivax, we
characterized plasmepsin 4 p. vivax (pvpm4). bacterially expressed
recombinant pvpm4 insoluble, easily refolded soluble
protein. processing pvpm4 mature enzyme occurred through
autocatalytic activity acidic conditions pepstatin a-sensitive manner,
in process portion prodomain essential correct folding. pvpm4 
could hydrolyze native human hemoglobin acidic phs, preferred denatured
hemoglobin substrate. pvpm4 acted synergistically vivapain-2 and
vivapain-3, cysteine proteases p. vivax, hydrolysis hemoglobin. 
vivapains also mediated processing pvpm4 mature enzyme. results
collectively suggest pvpm4 active hemoglobinase p. vivax works
collaboratively vivapains enhance parasite's ability hydrolyze
hemoglobin.
