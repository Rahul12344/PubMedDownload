plasmodium vivax second major human malaria parasite inflicts
debilitating morbidity consequent economic impact south-east asian
countries. relapsing nature p. vivax along emergence of
drug-resistant p. vivax strains emphasized urgent need vaccine.
however, development effective vivax vaccine seriously hampered due 
to diversity variation parasite antigens non-availability of
suitable animal models. dna based vaccines represent alternative approach in
inducing immunity multiple targets different stages malaria parasite. 
dna prime-boosting strategies induce antibody mediated cell-mediated
immune responses major mechanisms protection malaria
parasites. earlier studied immunogenicity protective efficacy 
the soluble refolded forms recombinant 42kda fragment plasmodium vivax 
merozoite surface protein-1 (pvmsp-142) using p. cynomolgi rhesus monkey model.
in present study, constructed recombinant dna vaccine encoding
42kda fragment p. vivax msp-1 studied immunogenicity pvmsp-142 dna 
vaccine construct mice. 42kda gene fragment pvmsp-1 pcr amplified
using gene specific primers subcloned pcdna 3.1 (+) eukaryotic
expression vector. vitro expression pvmsp-142 plasmid construct checked
by transfection cos-1 cell line. indirect immunofluorescence transfected
cos-1 cells probed monoclonal antibodies pvmsp-142 exhibited
positive fluorescence. immunization balb/c mice pvmsp-142-pcdna vaccine
construct revealed immunogenicity recombinant vaccine plasmid 
enhanced prime boosting recombinant protein corresponding dna
vaccine evidenced significant elevation antibody cytokines
