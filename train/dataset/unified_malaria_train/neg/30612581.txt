background: metabolic resistance major malaria vector anopheles gambiae
(s.l.) insecticides operationally significant, particularly combination 
with target site resistance. however, detection metabolic resistance not
trivial relies laborious bioassays, unspecific biochemical methods, or
sophisticated expensive molecular approaches using transcriptomics.
methods: rapid one-step multiplex taqman-probe based rt-qpcr assays were
developed optimised measure expression levels genes associated with
metabolic insecticide resistance an. gambiae (s.l.). primers probes were
designed target mrna cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenases cyp6p3,
cyp6m2, cyp9k1, cyp6p4 cyp6z1, glutathione-s-transferase gste2. the
novel assays validated versus gold standard methods range of
phenotyped mosquito specimens. assays also tested directly lysates of
rnalater®-preserved mosquitoes without rna extraction step.
results: novel assays efficient (reaction efficiencies = 95-109%),
sensitive (covering > 10.0 ct range r2 values > 0.99), specific (taqman
chemistry), reproducible (%cv = 4.46-12.07%), well readily expandable to
capture additional loci evolve cover additional species. assays
were successfully validated terms expression levels standard
two-step singleplex qpcr assays (overall % difference = -17.6%, 95% ci =
-38.7-3.43%) microarrays, using laboratory strains field-caught samples. 
the assays also applied directly lysates mosquito specimens, without
rna extraction dnase treatment.
conclusions: novel multiplex assays monitoring levels major
detoxification genes metabolic resistance an. gambiae (s.l.) simple to
perform, robust rapid. may complement current diagnostic assays to
provide evidence-based operationally relevant information insecticide
resistance management.
