nitric oxide (no) dicotomic influence modulating host-parasite interplay, 
synchronizing physiological orchestrations diagnostic potential; instigated
us investigate plausible association genetic regulation among no
level, components oxidative stress, inos polymorphisms risk malaria.
here, experimentally elucidate inos promoter polymorphisms associated
with risk malaria; employing mutation specific genotyping, functional
interplay using western blot rt-pcr, quantitative estimation no, total
antioxidant content (tac) reactive oxygen species (ros). genotyping revealed 
significantly associated risk p. vivax (adjusted = 1.92 1.72) p.
falciparum (adjusted = 1.68 1.75) infection snp inos-954g/c and
inos-1173c/t positions, respectively; though vivax showed higher risk of
infection. intriguingly, mutation infection specific differential
upregulation inos expression/no level observed found be
significantly associated mutant genotypes. moreover, p. vivax showed
pronounced inos protein (2.4 fold) mrna (2.5 fold) expression relative to
healthy subjects. furthermore, tac ros significantly decreased in
infection; differentially decreased mutant genotypes. findings endorse
polymorphic regulation inos expression, altered oxidant-antioxidant components
and evidences risk association hallmark malaria pathogenesis.
inos/no may serve potential diagnostic marker assessing clinical malaria.
