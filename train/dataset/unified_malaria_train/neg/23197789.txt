malaria parasites actively remodel infected red blood cell (irbc) by
exporting proteins host cell cytoplasm. human parasite plasmodium
falciparum exports particularly large numbers proteins, including proteins
that establish vesicular network allowing trafficking proteins onto 
surface irbcs responsible tissue sequestration. like p.
falciparum, rodent parasite p. berghei anka sequesters via irbc interactions 
with host receptor cd36. applied proteomic, genomic, and
reverse-genetic approaches identify p. berghei proteins potentially involved
in transport proteins irbc surface. comparative proteomics
analysis p. berghei non-sequestering sequestering parasites used to
determine changes irbc membrane associated sequestration. subsequent 
tagging experiments identified 13 proteins (plasmodium export element
(pexel)-positive well pexel-negative) exported irbc
cytoplasm distinct localization patterns: dispersed and/or patchy
distribution, punctate vesicle-like pattern cytoplasm, distinct
location irbc membrane. members pexel-negative bir and
pexel-positive pb-fam-3 show dispersed localization irbc cytoplasm, 
not irbc surface. two identified exported proteins transported 
to irbc membrane named erythrocyte membrane associated proteins.
emap1 member pexel-negative pb-fam-1 family, emap2 a
pexel-positive protein encoded single copy gene; neither protein plays a
direct role sequestration. observations clearly indicate p. berghei
traffics diverse range proteins different cellular locations via
mechanisms analogous employed p. falciparum. this
information exploited generate transgenic humanized rodent p. berghei
parasites expressing chimeric p. berghei/p. falciparum proteins surface of
rodent irbc, thereby opening new avenues vivo screening adjunct therapies 
that block sequestration.
