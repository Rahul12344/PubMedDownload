populations mixed origins) likely exerted new selective pressures 
parasite's genome. among genes might experienced strong selective
pressures response environmental changes, eba genes
(erythrocyte-binding antigens genes), involved invasion the
human red blood cells, constitute good candidates. study, analysed, in
south america, polymorphism three eba genes (eba-140, eba-175, eba-181)

to determine whether genes faced selective pressures south america
