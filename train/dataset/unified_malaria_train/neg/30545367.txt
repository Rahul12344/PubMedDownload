background: success malaria control eradication programme it
is essential reduce parasite transmission mosquito vectors. midguts 
of mosquitoes fed parasite-infected blood, sexual-stage parasites fertilize 
to develop motile ookinetes traverse midgut epithelial cells reside
adjacent basal lamina. therefore, ookinete promising target of
transmission-blocking vaccines break parasite lifecycle mosquito
vectors. however, molecular mechanisms ookinete formation invasion 
epithelial cells fully elucidated. unique structure called the
crystalloid body identified ookinete cytoplasm electron
microscopy, biological functions remain unclear.
methods: recombinant protein novel molecule, designated crystalloid
body specific ph domain-containing protein plasmodium yoelii (pycryph), was
synthesized using wheat germ cell-free system. specific rabbit antibodies
against pycryph obtained characterize expression localization 
pycryph sexual-stage parasite development. addition, pycryph knockout
parasites generated targeted gene disruption examine pycryph function 
in mosquito-stage parasite development.
results: western blot immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies
showed pycryph specifically expressed zygotes ookinetes. by
immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated pycryph localized within
crystalloid bodies. parasites disrupted pycryph gene developed normally
into ookinetes formed oocysts basal lamina midguts. addition,
the number sporozoites residing salivary glands comparable of
wild-type parasites.
conclusions: cryph, containing signal peptide ph domain, predominantly
expressed zygotes ookinetes localized crystalloid bodies p.
yoelii. cryph accumulates vesicle-like structures prior appearance of
typical crystalloid bodies. unlike known crystalloid body localized
proteins, cryph appear multiple domain architecture
characteristic lap/ccp family proteins. although cryph highly conserved
among plasmodium, babesia, theileria, cryptosporidium, pycryph dispensable
for development invasive ookinetes sporozoites mosquito bodies.
