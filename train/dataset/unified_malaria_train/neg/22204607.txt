in recent paper, described discovery antimalarial compounds
derived tadalafil, using drug-to-genome-to-drug approach ( j. med. chem.
2011 , 54 ( 9 ), pp 3222 - 3240 ). shown derivatives inhibit
the phosphodiesterase activity plasmodium falciparum parasite growth
in culture. paper, describe optimization compounds. a
direct consequence approach based gene orthology lack of
selectivity compounds original activity human target. we
demonstrate possible take advantage subtle differences in
sar hspde5 inhibition antiplasmodial activity improve
significantly selectivity. particular, replacement piperonyl
group compound 2 dimethoxyphenyl group best way optimize
selectivity. observation consistent differences human
and plasmodial sequences q2 pocket receiving group.
