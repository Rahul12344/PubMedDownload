introduction: anaplasma/ehrlichia species tick-transmitted pathogens that
cause infections humans numerous domestic wild animal species. there
is information available molecular characteristics phylogenetic
position anaplasma/ehrlichia spp. isolated tick species different
geographic locations iran. aim study determine the
prevalence, molecular characteristics, phylogenetic relationship both
anaplasma spp. ehrlichia spp. tick species isolated different
domestic animals two different geographical locations iran.
methods: total 930 ticks collected 93 cattle, 250 sheep, 587
goats inhabiting study areas. collected ticks investigated 
the presence anaplasma/ehrlichia spp. using nested pcr based 16s rrna
gene, followed sequencing. sequence analysis done based data
published genbank anaplasma/ehrlichia spp. isolates using bioinformatic
tools standard nucleotide blast.
results: genome anaplasma ehrlichia spp. detected 14 ticks collected
in heris, including 5 dermacentor marginatus, 1 haemaphysalis erinacei, 3
hyalomma anatolicum, 4 rhipicephalus sanguineus, also 29 ticks collected
in chabahar, including 14 r. sanguineus, 8 d. marginatus, 3 hyalomma anatolicum, 
and 4 hyalomma dromedarii. partial analysis 16s rrna gene sequence of
positive samples collected goats sheep showed infected
with anaplasma/ehrlichia spp. 94-98% identical ovine anaplasma and
91-96% identical neoehrlichia ehrlichia spp.
conclusion: various ticks identified study suggest possible
emergence tick-borne diseases animals humans regions. r.
sanguineus d. marginatus seem predominant vectors responsible for
anaplasmosis regions. partial sequence analysis 16s rrna gene
showed a. ovis genetically polymorphic regions. furthermore, 
association genetic heterogeneity microorganism the
geographical regions anaplasma strains found. study also showed 
those ticks collected geographical origin infected
with closely related strains anaplasma.
