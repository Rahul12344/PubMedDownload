heme ubiquitous, yet relatively little known maintenance of
labile pools cofactor, likely ensures timely bioavailability
for proper cellular function. quantitative analysis labile heme of
fundamental importance understanding nature preserves access the
diverse chemistry heme enables, minimizing cellular damage caused its
redox activity. here, developed characterized protein-based sensor 
that undergoes fluorescence quenching upon heme binding. genetically encoding 
this sensor human malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum, have
quantified cytosolic labile heme levels intact, blood-stage parasites. our
findings indicate labile heme pool (∼1.6 µm) stably maintained
throughout parasite development within red blood cells, even period
coincident extensive hemoglobin degradation parasite. also find
that heme-binding antimalarial drug chloroquine specifically increases labile
cytosolic heme, indicative dysregulation homeostatic pool may 
a relevant component antimalarial activity compound class. we
propose use technology various environmental perturbations 
p. falciparum yield quantitative insights fundamental heme biology.
