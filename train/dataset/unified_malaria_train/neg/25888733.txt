background: haem oxygenase-1 (ho-1) catabolizes haem cytotoxic and
cytoprotective effects. polymorphisms promoter haem oxygenase-1
(hmox1) gene encoding ho-1 associated several diseases including
severe malaria. objective study determine allele and
genotype frequencies two single nucleotide polymorphisms; a(-413)t and
g(-1135)a, (gt)n repeat length polymorphism hmox1 promoter in
paediatric malaria patients controls determine possible associations 
malaria disease severity.
methods: study participants ghanaian children (n=296) admitted the
emergency room department child health, korle-bu teaching hospital,
accra, ghana malaria season june august 1995, 1996 and
1997, classified uncomplicated malaria (n=101) severe malaria
(n=195; defined severe anaemia (n=63) cerebral malaria (n=132)).
furthermore, 287 individuals without detectable plasmodium infection or
asymptomatic carriers parasite enrolled controls. blood samples
from participants extracted dna allele genotype frequencies were
determined allele-specific pcr, restriction fragment length analysis and
microsatellite analysis.
results: number (gt)n repeats study participants varied 21 
and 46 majority alleles lengths 26 (8.1%), 29/30
(13.2/17.9%) 39/40 (8.0/13.8%) repeats, categorized short,
medium long repeats. (-413)t allele common (69.8%), the
(-1135)a allele present 17.4% ghanaian population. the
g(-1135)a locus excluded analysis failing the
hardy-weinberg equilibrium test. significant differences allele genotype
distribution a(-413)t (gt)n repeat polymorphisms found between
the controls malaria patients, disease groups, 
the analysed polymorphisms associations malaria severity found.
conclusion: results contribute understanding role of
hmox1/ho-1. current study find evidence association between
hmox1 promoter polymorphisms malaria susceptibility severe malaria and
hence contradicts previous findings. studies needed fully
elucidate relationship hmox1 polymorphisms malarial disease.
