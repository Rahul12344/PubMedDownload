pfcdpk1 [plasmodium falciparum cdpk1 (calcium-dependent protein kinase 1)] is
highly expressed parasite asexual blood mosquito stages. role still
poorly understood, unsuccessful gene knockout attempts suggest is
essential parasite replication and/or rbc (red blood cell) invasion. the
present study, tagging endogenous cdpk1 gfp (green fluorescent protein), 
we demonstrate cdpk1 localizes parasite plasma membrane of
replicating invasive forms well young intracellular parasites 
does appear exported rbcs. although knockdown endogenous
cdpk1 achieved using destabilization domain, parasites tolerated reduced
expression without displaying phenotype. this, pfcdpk1
auto-inhibitory j (junction) domain explored means achieving
inducible specific inhibition. inÂ vitro conditions, fusion protein
comprising j-gfp fusion specifically bound pfcdpk1 inhibited its
activity. fusion protein conditionally expressed p. falciparum
asexual blood stages regulation dd (destabilization domain)
(j-gfp-dd). demonstrate j-gfp-dd binds cdpk1 results 
the arrest parasite development late cell cycle early
schizogony. data point early schizont function pfcdpk1 and
demonstrate conditionally expressing auto-inhibitory regions an
effective way address function plasmodium enzymes.
