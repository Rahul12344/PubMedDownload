chromosomal inversions important structural changes may facilitate
divergent selection capture co-adaptive loci face gene flow. 
however, identifying selection targets within inversions challenging. 
high degrees differentiation heterokaryotypes, well the
differences demographic histories collinear regions compared inverted 
ones, reduce power traditional outlier analyses detecting selected
loci. here, develop new approach uses discriminant functions informed
from inversion-specific expectations classify loci selection
(or drift). analysis rad sequencing data collected classic dipteran
species polymorphic inversion clines-anopheles gambiae, malaria vector
species sub-saharan africa-demonstrates benefits approach
compared traditional outlier analyses. focus specifically two
polymorphic inversions, 2la 2rb arrangements predominate dry
habitats 2l+(a) 2r+(b) arrangements wet habitats, contrast
with minimal geographic structure snps collinear regions. our
approach, identify two strongly selected regions within 2la associated with
dry habitat. moreover, also show prevalence selection greater
in arrangement 2l+(a) associated wet habitat (unlike presumed
importance selective divergence associated shift mosquitoes
into dry habitats). discuss implications results respect 
studies rapid adaptation malaria vectors, particular, the
insights newly developed approach offers identifying potential
targets selection, also population undergone adaptive change.
