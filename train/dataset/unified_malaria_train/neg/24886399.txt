background: permanet® 3.0 insecticide synergist-combination long-lasting
insecticidal net designed increased efficacy malaria vectors with
metabolic resistance, even combined kdr. current study reports on
the impact improved tool entomological indices area with
pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors nigeria.
methods: baseline entomological indices across eight villages remo north lga
of ogun state provided basis selection three villages (ilara, irolu
and ijesa) comparing efficacy permanet® 3.0 (pn3.0), permanet® 2.0
(pn2.0) untreated polyester nets control (utc). case, nets 
distributed cover sleeping spaces evaluated insecticidal
activity 3-monthly basis. collection mosquitoes conducted monthly via
window traps indoor resting catches. arithmetic means mosquito catches
per house, entomological inoculation rates intervention
were compared well three outcome parameters: mean mosquito blood 
feeding rate, mean mortality mean parity rates.
results: anopheles gambiae s.l. main malaria vector three
villages, accounting >98% anopheles population found in
appreciable numbers 6-7 months. deltamethrin, permethrin and
lambdacyhalothrin resistance confirmed ilara, irolu ijesa. kdr
mutation sole resistance mechanism ilara, whereas kdr plus p450-based 
metabolic mechanisms detected irolu ijesa. bioassays repeated on
domestically used pn 2.0 pn 3.0 showed persistent optimal (100%) bio-efficacy
for net types 3rd, 6th, 9th 12th month following net
distribution. use pn 3.0 significantly reduced mosquito densities a
'mass killing' effect inside houses. households pn 3.0 also showed reduced
blood feeding well lower mosquito parity sporozoite rates compared to
the pn 2.0 utc villages. significant reduction entomological
inoculation rate detected pn 2.0 village (75%) pn 3.0 village
(97%) post llin-distribution utc village.
conclusion: study confirms efficacy pn 3.0 reducing malaria
transmission compared pyrethroid-only llins presence malaria vectors
with p450-based metabolic- resistance mechanisms.
