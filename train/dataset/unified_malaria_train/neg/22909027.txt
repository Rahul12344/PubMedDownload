objective: evaluate anti-folate (sulphadoxine)-resistant pattern in
kolkata, one malaria endemic zones eastern india.
methods: first, 107 p. falciparum suspected cases enrolled study.
ninety isolates (84.11%) 107 suspected cases analysed, had
mono-infection p. falciparum. vitro susceptibility assays performed 
in 90 isolates. parasitic dna isolated phenol-chloroform extraction
method polymerase chain reaction followed restriction fragment length 
polymorphism analysis different codons pfdhps gene (436, 437, 540, 581 
and 613).
results: among 90 isolates kolkata, dhps mutant isolates codons 436, 437,
540, 581 613 found 53.33%, 67.78%, 46.66%, 15.56% 45.55%,
respectively. vitro sulphadoxine resistance found 49 isolates (54.44%).
interestingly found 33 isolates (36.67%) quadruple ageat mutant allele,
of 32 isolates (96.97%) highly sulphadoxine resistant (p < 0.01) in
vitro.
conclusion: present findings implicate enormous drug
(sulphfadoxine) pressure, novel ageat mutation highly correlated (p < 0.01)
with sulphadoxine resistance.
