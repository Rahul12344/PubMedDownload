the molecular basis sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance lies a
combination single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) two genes coding for
plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) p. falciparum
dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), targeted pyrimethamine sulfadoxine,
respectively. continued use sp intermittent preventive treatment in
pregnant women many african countries, despite sp's discontinuation a
first-line antimalarial treatment option due high levels drug resistance,
may increase prevalence sp-resistant parasites and/or lead 
selection new mutations. antimalarial drug resistance surveillance study
was conducted western kenya 2010 2013. total 203 clinical
samples children uncomplicated malaria genotyped snps
associated sp resistance. prevalence triple-mutant pfdhfr c50
i51r59n108: i164 genotype double-mutant pfdhps s436 g437e540: a581a613
genotype high. two triple-mutant pfdhps genotypes, s436 g437e540g581: a613
and h436g437e540: a581a613, found, latter thus far uniquely
found western kenya. prevalence s436 g437e540g581: a613 genotype
was low. however, steady increase prevalence pfdhps triple-mutant
h436g437e540: a581a613 genotype observed since appearance early
2000. isolates genotypes shared substantial microsatellite haplotypes 
with common double-mutant allele, suggesting triple-mutant
allele may evolved locally. overall, findings show prevalence
of h436g437e540: a581a613 triple mutant may increasing population 
and could compromise efficacy sp intermittent preventive treatment 
pregnant women increases resistance threshold further.
