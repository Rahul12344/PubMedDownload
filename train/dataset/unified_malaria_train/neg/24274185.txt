background: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine new act administered as
single daily dose three days demonstrated tolerated and
highly effective treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum
malaria. piperaquine used alone replace chloroquine first-line
treatment uncomplicated malaria china response increasing
chloroquine resistance 1970s. however, rapid emergence of
piperaquine-resistant strains resulted cessation use china 
in 1980s, suggests cross-resistance piperaquine and
chloroquine. data available cross-resistance piperaquine 
and chloroquine, data exist often contradictory.
methods: total, 280 p. falciparum isolates, collected april 2008 and
june 2012 patients hospitalized france imported malaria a
malaria-endemic country, assessed ex vivo piperaquine chloroquine
susceptibilities using standard 42-hour 3h-hypoxanthine uptake inhibition 
method. chloroquine resistance-associated mutation k76t pfcrt also
investigated 280 isolates.
results: ic50 piperaquine ranged 9.8 nm 217.3 nm (mean = 81.3 nm.
the ic50 chloroquine ranged 5.0 nm 1,918 nm (mean = 83.6 nm. a
significant low correlation observed log ic50 values for
piperaquine chloroquine (r = 0.145, p < 0.001). however, coefficient of
determination 0.021 indicates 2.1% variation response 
to piperaquine explained variation response chloroquine. 
mean value piperaquine 74.0 nm pfcrt k76 wild-type group
(no = 125) 87.7 nm 76 t mutant group (no = 155). difference was
not significant (p = 0.875, mann whitney u test).
conclusions: present work demonstrates cross-resistance
between piperaquine chloroquine among 280 p. falciparum isolates that
piperaquine susceptibility associated pfcrt, gene involved in
chloroquine resistance. results confirm efficacy piperaquine in
association dihydroartemisinin support use areas which
parasites resistant chloroquine.
