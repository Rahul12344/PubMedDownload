cerebral malaria (cm) severe manifestation infection with
plasmodium, however pathogenesis still completely understood. microrna
(mirna) area focus infectious disease research, due their
ability affect normal biological processes, shown play roles 
in various viral, bacterial parasitic infections, including malaria. the
expression mirna studied following infection cba mice either
plasmodium berghei anka (causing cm), plasmodium yoelii (causing severe but
non-cerebral malaria (ncm)). using microarray analysis, mirna expression was
compared brains non-infected (ni), ncm cm mice. six mirna were
significantly dysregulated ncm cm mice, four these,
mir-19a-3p, mir-19b-3p, mir-142-3p mir-223-3p, validated qpcr
assays. mirna significantly involved several pathways relevant to
cm, including tgf-β endocytosis pathways. dysregulation mirna
during cm specifically compared ncm suggests mirna, their
regulation downstream targets, may vitally involved neurological
syndrome. data implies that, least mouse model, mirna may play a
regulatory role cm pathogenesis.
