background: artemisinin monotherapy plasmodium falciparum infection is
frequently ineffective due recrudescence. artemisinin-induced dormancy, shown 
in vitro animal models, provides plausible explanation. date, direct 
evidence artemisinin-induced dormancy humans lacking.
methods: blood samples collected plasmodium falciparum 3d7- or
k13-infected participants 48-72 hours single dose artesunate
(as) treatment. parasite morphology, molecular signature dormancy, capability 
and dynamics seeding vitro cultures, genetic mutations k13 gene 
were investigated.
results: dormant parasites observed post-as blood samples 3d7- and
k13-infected participants. molecular signature dormancy, up-regulation 
of acetyl coa carboxylase, detected 3d7 k13 samples post-as, not
in pre-as samples. post-treatment samples successfully seeded vitro cultures, 
with significant delay time reach 2% parasitemia compared to
pre-treatment samples.
conclusion: study provides strong evidence presence of
artemisinin-induced dormant parasites p. falciparum infections. these
parasites likely reservoir recrudescent infection following artemisinin
monotherapy artemisinin combination therapy (act). combination regimens 
target dormant parasites remain therapeutic levels sufficient time to
kill recovering parasites likely improve efficacy acts.
