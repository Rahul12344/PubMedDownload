background: babesia, usually found wild domestic mammals worldwide, have
recently responsible emerging malaria-like zoonosis infected
patients. human b. microti infection identified china, primarily in
the southwest along myanmar border little direct surveillance b.
microti infection rodents carried (yunnan province). this
region, diverse topographic range combined tropical moisture sustains a
high biodiversity small mammals, might play important role babesia
transmission.
methods: small mammals captured 141 sample locations 18 counties
located yunnan province, screened b. microti-like parasites infection 
a nested pcr target 18s rrna gene babesia, plus directly sequencing for
positive samples. univariate multivariate forward stepwise logistic
regression analysis used access association infections and
some related risk factors.
results: infection babesia microti confirmed 2.4% (53/ 2204) small
mammals. significant differences prevalence rates b. microti observed 
based variations forest, agricultural, residential landscapes.
furthermore, adult small mammals higher prevalence rates younger,
pubertal mammals. near full-length 18s rrna gene revealed two
types b. microti, kobe otsu, demonstrate genetic diversity and
regional distribution.
conclusions: exists wide distribution genetic diversity endemic b.
microti southwestern china, warranting investigations monitoring
of clinical disease individuals presenting babesia like symptoms these
areas.
