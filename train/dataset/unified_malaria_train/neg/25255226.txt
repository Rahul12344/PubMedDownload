since innate lymphoid cells (ilcs) found play role immune
response helminth parasites rodents, sought determine role in
human helminth infection. developing multicolor flow cytometry-based methods
to identify enumerate circulating ilcs subsets, able to
identify subset ckit+ ilcs defined lineage (lin)-/cd45+/ckit+/cd127+ that
were significantly expanded filarial-infected individuals (p=0.0473) as
were ckit+ ilcs produced il-13. additionally, frequency these
ckit+ ilcs correlated frequency il-17 producing cd4+ cells (th17
cells; p=0.025). investigate function ckit+ ilcs, sorted, highly
purified human ilcs subjected transcriptional profiling rnaseq and
compared appropriate control cells. ckit+ ilcs expressed tlrs, broad
range cytokines/cytokine receptors mhc class ii molecules suggesting 
these ilcs sense pathogens independent cell types. functional analysis
revealed expanded ckit+ ilc-specific transcription ilc-specific microrna
precursors.
