the success mosquito-based malaria control dependent upon susceptible
bionomic traits local malaria vectors. crucial accurate and
reliable methods determine mosquito species composition areas subject to
malaria. unexpectedly diverse set anopheles species collected the
western kenyan highlands, including unidentified potentially new species
carrying malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. study identified 2,340 
anopheline specimens using ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer region 
2 mitochondrial dna cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 loci. seventeen distinct
sequence groups identified. these, eight could molecularly
identified comparison published voucher sequences. the
unidentified species, four found carry p. falciparum circumsporozoite 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polymerase chain reaction, most
abundant infection rates comparable primary vector area,
anopheles funestus. high-quality adult specimens unidentified species
could matched museum voucher specimens conclusively identified using
multiple keys, suggesting may previously described. these
unidentified vectors captured outdoors. diverse unknown species have
been incriminated malaria transmission western kenya highlands using
molecular identification unusual morphological variants field specimens.
this study demonstrates value using molecular methods compliment vector
identifications highlights need accurate characterization mosquito
species associated behaviors effective malaria control.
