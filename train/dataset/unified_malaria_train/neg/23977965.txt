background: plasmodium vivax potential infect 2.85 billion individuals
worldwide. nevertheless, limited number studies investigating immune
status individuals living malaria-endemic areas, well lack of
reports investigating serological markers associated clinical protection,
has hampered development vaccines p. vivax. previously demonstrated
that naturally total igg n-terminus p. vivax merozoite surface
protein 1 (pv-msp1) associated reduced risk malarial infection.
methods: immune response pv-msp1 (n-terminus) 313 residents rio
pardo rural settlement (amazonas state, brazil) evaluated a
cross-sectional longitudinal follow two months (on site) wherein gold
standard diagnosis thick blood smear rrna gene-based nested real-time pcr 
were used discriminate symptomless plasmodium vivax-infected individuals who
did develop clinical symptoms 2-months uninfected ones or
who acute malaria. acquisition antibodies pv-msp1 was
also evaluated survival analysis prospective study year collecting
information new malaria infections surveillance database.
results: majority p. vivax-infected individuals (52-67%) showed immune
recognition n-terminus pv-msp1. interesting data infected
individuals developed symptoms, total igg levels the
n-terminus pv-msp1 age-dependent igg3 levels significantly
higher levels subjects acute malaria uninfected ones. the
total igg anti icb2-5 detected important factor protection
against new malaria vivax attacks survival analysis prospective survey
(p = 0.029).
conclusions: study findings illustrate importance igg3 associated to
2-months symptomless p. vivax infected individuals open perspectives
for rationale malaria vaccine designs capable sustain high levels of
igg3 polymorphic malaria antigens.
