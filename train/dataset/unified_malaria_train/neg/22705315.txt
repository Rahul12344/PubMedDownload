experimental reverse genetic approaches proven powerful study 
biology malaria parasite. murine malaria model parasite plasmodium
berghei genetically amendable plasmodium species allows full
access entire life cycle vivo. here, describe next-generation,
highly versatile transfection vector set facilitates advancing experimental 
genetic strategies towards genome-wide scale. 36 consecutive cloning
and 17 subcloning steps optimized vector set generated standard
transfection plasmid. targeting vectors, collectively referred the
berghei adaptable transfection (pbat) plasmids, contain key elements permit 
recycling drug-selectable cassette, robust green fluorescent labelling 
recombinant parasites, carboxy-terminal tagging target proteins red
fluorescent-epitope tag fusion, expression heterologous genes. vectors
were optimized small size, versatile restriction endonuclease
recognition sites potential exchange individual vector elements. show
that stable integration transgene expression site, intergenic locus 
a synteny breakpoint p. berghei chromosome 6, phenotypically silent and
generated bright green fluorescent parasite line imaging applications. we
provide example, p. berghei actin 2, targeted gene deletion illustrate
that positive selection marker recycled, thereby permitting multiple
rounds genetic manipulations. propose vectors described herein
will greatly facilitate functional assignment predicted orphan plasmodium 
gene models multiple experimental genetics approaches.
