the initial steps odorant recognition insect olfactory system involve
odorant binding proteins (obps) odorant receptors (ors). large families
of obps identified malaria vector a. gambiae, little known
about expression pattern numerous sensory hairs female
antenna. applied whole mount fluorescence situ hybridization (wm-fish) 
fluorescence immunohistochemistry (wm-fihc) investigate sensilla
co-expression eight a. gambiae obps (agobps), notably agobp1 agobp4, 
which abundant transcripts female antenna. wm-fish analysis female
antennae using agobp-specific probes revealed marked differences number of
cells expressing various agobps. testing combinations agobp probes in
two-color wm-fish resulted distinct cellular labeling patterns, indicating a
combinatorial expression agobps revealing distinct agobp requirements 
various functional sensilla types. wm-fihc antisera agobp1 agobp4
confirmed expression respective proteins support cells demonstrated
a location obps within sensilla trichodea. based finding agobp1
and agobp4 well receptor type agor2 involved recognition 
indole, experiments performed explore agobp-types agor2 are
co-expressed distinct olfactory sensilla. applying two-color wm-fish with
agobp-specific probes probes specific agor2 revealed close association 
of support cells bearing transcripts agobp1 agobp4 neurons a
transcript receptor agor2. moreover, combined wm-fish/-fihc approaches
using agor2-specific riboprobe agobp-specific antisera revealed the
expression "ligand-matched" agobp1, agobp4 agor2 single trichoid
hairs. result substantiates notion specific response indole is
mediated interplay proteins.
