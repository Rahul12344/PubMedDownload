immunization live-attenuated plasmodium sporozoites completely protects
against malaria infection. genetic engineering offers versatile platform to
create live-attenuated sporozoite vaccine candidates. previously generated a
genetically attenuated parasite (gap) deleting p52 p36 genes the
nf54 wild-type (wt) strain plasmodium falciparum (pf p52(-)/p36(-) gap).
preclinical assessment p52(-)/p36(-) gap humanized mouse model indicated 
an early severe liver stage growth defect. however, human exposure >200 pf
p52(-)/p36(-) gap-infected mosquito bites safety trial resulted in
peripheral parasitemia one six volunteers, revealing gap was
incompletely attenuated. created triple gene deleted gap by
additionally removing sap1 gene (pf p52(-)/p36(-)/sap1(-) gap) employed
flippase (flp)/flippase recognition target (frt) recombination drug
selectable marker cassette removal. next-generation gap was
indistinguishable wt parasites blood stage mosquito stage
development. using improved humanized mouse model transplanted human
hepatocytes human red blood cells, show despite high-dose
sporozoite challenge, pf p52(-)/p36(-)/sap1(-) gap transition blood
stage infection appeared completely attenuated. thus, clinical testing 
of pf p52(-)/p36(-)/sap1(-) gap assessing safety, immunogenicity, efficacy
against sporozoite challenge warranted.
