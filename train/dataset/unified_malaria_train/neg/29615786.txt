the ability human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum adapt to
environmental changes depends considerably ability maintain
within-population genetic variation. strong selection, consequent widespread
antimalarial drug usage, occasionally elicits rapid expansion drug-resistant
isolates, act founders. investigate whether phenomenon
induces loss within-population genetic variation, performed population 
genetic analysis 302â€‰p. falciparum cases detected two cross-sectional
surveys 2002/2003, official introduction of
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine first-line treatment, 2010/2011, 
highly endemic areas papua new guinea. found single-origin
sulphadoxine-resistant parasite isolate rapidly increased 0% 2002/2003 to
54% 2010 84% 2011. however, considerable number pairs exhibited
random associations among 10 neutral microsatellite markers located various
chromosomes, suggesting outcrossing effectively reduced non-random
associations, albeit low average multiplicity infection (1.35-1.52).
within-population genetic diversity maintained throughout study period.
this indicates parasites maintained within-population variation, even
after clonal expansion drug-resistant parasites. outcrossing played role
in preservation within-population genetic diversity despite low levels 
multiplicity infection.
