objective: identify incidence k76t mutation pfcrt genes of
imported plasmodium falciparum.
methods: blood samples collected returnees infected p.
falciparum endemic areas southeast asia africa 2008 2012.
according pfcrt gene sequence p. falciparum, nested pcr primers were
designed. nested pcr-rflp applied falciparum dna blood samples as
templates.
results: among 92 blood samples p. falciparum, mutant pfcrt alleles were
found 50 samples (54.3%), wild type pfcrt alleles found 42
samples (45.7%). 33 samples (47.1%) mutant pfcrt alleles 37
samples (52.9%) wild type, respectively, africa. 17 samples 
(77.3%) mutant pfcrt alleles 5 samples (22.7%) wild type,
respectively, southeast asia. significant difference the
africa group southeast asia group (chi(2) = 6.12, p < 0.05).
conclusion: incidence pfcrt gene mutation different among p. falciparum
isolates different regions. therefore, pfcrt k76t application value
in surveillance imported falciparum chloroquine-resistance.
