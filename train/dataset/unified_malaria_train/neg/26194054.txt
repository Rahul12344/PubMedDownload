apicomplexan parasites including toxoplasma gondii plasmodium species have
complex life cycles include multiple hosts differentiation through
several morphologically distinct stages requiring marked changes gene
expression. review highlights emerging evidence implicating regulation of
mrna splicing mechanism prime parasites rapid gene expression
upon differentiation. summarize important insights alternative
splicing including role regulating gene expression decreasing mrna
abundance via 'regulated unproductive splicing translation'. related but
less well-understood mechanism, discuss also recent work suggesting role
for intron retention precluding translation stage specific isoforms t. 
gondii glycolytic enzymes. additionally provide new evidence intron
retention might widespread mechanism parasite differentiation.
supporting notion, recent genome-wide analysis toxoplasma plasmodium 
suggests intron retention pervasive heretofore thought. these
findings parallel recent emergence intron retention prevalent in
mammals previously believed, thereby adding established roles in
plants, fungi unicellular eukaryotes. deeper mechanistic studies intron
retention provide important insight role regulating gene
expression apicomplexan parasites general eukaryotic organisms.
