malaria parasites (plasmodium spp.) plagued humans millennia. less well 
known related parasites (haemosporida), diverse life cycles dipteran
vectors infect vertebrates. understanding evolution parasite
life histories, including switches hosts vectors, depends on
knowledge evolutionary relationships among parasite lineages. particular,
inferences concerning time origin trait evolution require correct
placement root evolutionary tree. phylogenetic reconstructions of
the diversification malaria parasites dna sequences suffered from
uncertainty concerning outgroup taxa, limited taxon sampling, selection on
genes used assess relationships. result, inferred relationships among the
haemosporida unstable, questions concerning evolutionary
diversification host switching remain unanswered. recent phylogeny placed
mammalian malaria parasites, well avian/reptilian plasmodium, derived 
position relative avian parasite genera leucocytozoon haemoproteus,
implying ancestral forms lacked merogony blood their
vectors non-mosquito dipterans. bayesian, outgroup-free phylogenetic
reconstruction using relaxed molecular clocks uncorrelated rates instead
suggested mammalian avian/reptilian plasmodium parasites, spread by
mosquito vectors, ancestral sister taxa, variety specialized 
parasite lineages modified life histories evolved.
