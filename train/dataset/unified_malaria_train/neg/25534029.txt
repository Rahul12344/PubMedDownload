we explored potential pooled sequencing swiftly economically
identify selective sweeps due emerging artemisinin (art) resistance a
south-east asian malaria parasite population. art resistance defined slow
parasite clearance blood art-treated patients mutations the
kelch gene (chr. 13) strongly implicated play role. constructed
triplicate pools 70 slow-clearing (resistant) 70 fast-clearing (sensitive)
infections collected thai-myanmar border sequenced high (∼ 
150-fold) read depth. allele frequency estimates pools showed almost perfect
correlation (lin's concordance = 0.98) allele frequencies 93 single
nucleotide polymorphisms measured directly individual infections, giving us 
confidence accuracy approach. mapping genome-wide divergence

for art resistance (p = 6.03 × 10(-6)). two-tier approach powerful
because pooled sequencing rapidly narrows genome regions interest,
