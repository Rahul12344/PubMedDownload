background: antimalarial drugs may impact mosquito's defense plasmodium
parasites. previous study showed nitroquine significantly reduced infection
of anopheles stephensi plasmodium yoelii, underlying mechanism remains
unclear. order understand transmission capacity an. stephensi was
affected nitroquine, explored transcriptome adult females after
different treatments, examined changes gene expression profiles, and
identified transcripts affected drug parasite.
methodology/principal findings: extended massively parallel sequencing and
data analysis (including gene discovery, expression profiling, function
prediction) an. stephensi plasmodium infection or
without nitroquine treatment. using numbers reads assembled specific
contigs calculate relative abundances (ras), categorized assembled
contigs four groups according differences ra values infection
induced, infection suppressed, drug induced, drug suppressed. found both
nitroquine blood meal plasmodium infection altered transcription of
mosquito genes implicated diverse processes, including pathogen recognition,
signal transduction, prophenoloxidase activation, cytoskeleton assembling, cell
adhesion, oxidative stress. differential gene expression may have
promoted certain defense responses an. stephensi parasite and
decreased infectivity.
conclusions/significance: study indicated nitroquine may regulate
several immune mechanisms level gene transcription mosquito
against plasmodium infection. highlights need better understanding
of antimalarial drug's impact parasite survival transmission. addition,
our data largely enriched existing sequence information an. stephensi, 
epidemiologically important vector species.
