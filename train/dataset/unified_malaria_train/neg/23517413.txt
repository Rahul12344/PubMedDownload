the pathogenicity deadly human malaria parasite, plasmodium
falciparum, relies export virulence factors surface infected 
erythrocytes. novel membrane compartment, referred maurer's clefts, is
transposed host erythrocyte, acting marshal platform red blood
cell cytoplasm, exported parasite proteins addressed host cell plasma 
membrane. report characterization three new p. falciparum
multigene families organized 9 highly conserved clusters pfmc-2tm
genes subtelomeric regions parasite's chromosomes expressed at
early trophozoite stages. like pfmc-2tm proteins, pfepf1, 3 4
proteins encoded families exported maurer's clefts, as
peripheral integral proteins maurer's cleft membrane largely
exposed red cell cytosolic face membrane. promoter titration
approach used question biological roles these
p. falciparum-specific exported proteins. using pfepf1 family promoter, we
observed specific downregulation four families, correlating the
inefficient release merozoites parasite intra-erythrocytic
maturation maurer's clefts morphology impacted.
