background: plasmodium falciparum, deadliest causative agent malaria, 
high prevalence nigeria. drug resistance causing failure previously
effective drugs compromised anti-malarial treatment. basis, 
need proactive surveillance resistance markers currently
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (act), early detection of
resistance become widespread.
methods: study assessed anti-malarial resistance genes polymorphism in
patients uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria lagos, nigeria. sanger and
next generation sequencing (ngs) methods used screen mutations in
thirty-seven malaria positive blood samples targeting p. falciparum
chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt), p. falciparum multidrug-resistance 1 
(pfmdr1), p. falciparum kelch 13 (pfk13) genes, previously
associated anti-malarial resistance.
results: expectedly, ngs method proficient, detecting six pfmdr1,
seven pfcrt three pfk13 mutations studied clinical isolates from
nigeria, malaria endemic area. mutations included rare pfmdr1 mutations, 
n504k, n649d, f938y s967n, previously unreported. addition,
there moderate prevalence k76t mutation (34.6%) associated with
chloroquine amodiaquine resistance, high prevalence n86 wild type 
allele (92.3%) associated lumefantrine resistance.
conclusion: widespread circulation mutations associated resistance to
current anti-malarial drugs could potentially limit effective malaria therapy 
endemic populations.
