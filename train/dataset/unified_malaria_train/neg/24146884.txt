anopheline mosquitoes primary vectors parasites genus
plasmodium, causative agents malaria. malaria parasites undergo series
of complex transformations upon ingestion mosquito host. this
process, physical barrier midgut epithelium, along innate immune 
defenses, functionally restrict parasite development. although defenses
have studied time, regulatory factors control are
poorly understood. protein kinase c (pkc) gene family consists of
serine/threonine kinases serve central signaling molecules regulators
of broad spectrum cellular processes including epithelial barrier function
and immunity. indeed, pkcs highly conserved, ranging 7 isoforms in
drosophila 16 isoforms mammals, yet none identified in
mosquitoes. despite conservation pkc gene family potential as
targets transmission-blocking strategies malaria, direct connections
between pkcs, mosquito immune response epithelial barrier integrity are
known. here, identify characterize six pkc gene family members--pkcδ,
pkcε, pkcζ, pkd, pkn, indeterminate conventional pkc--in anopheles gambiae
and anopheles stephensi. sequence phylogenetic analyses anopheline
pkcs support subfamily assignments. six pkcs expressed midgut
epithelia a. gambiae a. stephensi post-blood feeding, indicating
availability signaling tissue critical malaria parasite
development. although inhibition pkc enzymatic activity decreased
nf-κb-regulated anti-microbial peptide expression mosquito cells vitro, pkc
inhibition effect expression panel immune genes midgut
epithelium vivo. pkc inhibition did, however, significantly increase midgut
barrier integrity decrease development p. falciparum oocysts a.
stephensi, suggesting pkc-dependent signaling negative regulator of
epithelial barrier function potential new target transmission-blocking 
strategies.
