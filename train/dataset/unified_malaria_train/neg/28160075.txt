among actual 16 identified thought valid avian piroplasm species,
certain parasites known original description no
subsequent report. babesia ardeae toumanoff, 1940 one them. was
described single sacrificed gray heron (ardea cinerea) vietnam and
had never reported since date despite inhabiting common avian
host. present study reports accidental rediscovery b. ardeae an
injured wild gray heron rescued singapore. report confirms existence 
of parasite species gray heron southeast asia, highlights the
similarities original description, provides additional morphologic and
morphometric data, designates neotype material b. ardeae. additionally,
the report also furnishes first molecular data b. ardeae the
amplification sequencing near-full-length 18s rrna gene sequence and
its comparison available sequences avian piroplasms.
phylogenetic analysis based gene performed study relationship 
of b. ardeae piroplasms mammals birds indicated 
b. ardeae appears brother group clade formed several avian piroplasm
species isolated seabirds, altogether clustering well-supported clade
related "babesia duncani group" protothelerids. scarcity this
parasite discussed well taxonomy relation conundrum 
the systematics piroplasms.
