the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c) highly conserved
multi-subunit e3 ubiquitin ligase controls mitotic division eukaryotic
cells tagging cell cycle regulators proteolysis. apc3 key component
that contributes apc/c function. plasmodium, causative agent malaria,
undergoes atypical mitotic division life cycle. small subset of
apc/c components identified plasmodium involvement in
atypical cell division well understood. here, using reverse genetics we
examined localisation function apc3 plasmodium berghei. apc3 was
observed single focus co-localised centriolar plaque during
asexual cell division schizonts, whereas appeared multiple foci male 
gametocytes. functional studies using gene disruption conditional knockdown
revealed essential roles apc3 mitotic stages loss resulting 
in lack chromosome condensation, abnormal cytokinesis absence of
microgamete formation. overall, data suggest plasmodium utilises unique 
cell cycle machinery coordinate various processes endomitosis, this
warrants investigation future studies.
