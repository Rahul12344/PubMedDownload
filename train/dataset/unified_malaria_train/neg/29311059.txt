g-quadruplexes dna rna secondary structures formed from
guanine-rich nucleic acids. four-stranded structures, composed stacked
quartets guanine bases, highly stable demonstrated to
occur vivo dna human cells systems, play
important biological roles, influencing processes telomere maintenance,
dna replication transcription, or, case rna g-quadruplexes, rna
translation processing. report first time dna g-quadruplexes 
can detected nuclei malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum,
which one a/t-biased genomes sequenced therefore possesses
few guanine-rich sequences potential form g-quadruplexes. show
that despite paucity putative g-quadruplex-forming sequences, p.
falciparum parasites sensitive several g-quadruplex-stabilizing drugs,
including quarfloxin, previously reached phase 2 clinical trials an
anticancer drug. quarfloxin rapid initial rate kill active
against ring stages well replicative stages intraerythrocytic
development. show several g-quadruplex-stabilizing drugs, including
quarfloxin, suppress transcription g-quadruplex-containing reporter 
gene p. falciparum quarfloxin appear disrupt the
transcription rrnas, proposed mode action human
cells trypanosomes. data suggest quarfloxin potential for
repositioning antimalarial novel mode action. furthermore,
g-quadruplex biology p. falciparum may present target development of
other new antimalarial drugs.
