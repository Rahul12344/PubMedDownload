the use malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) source nucleic acids
that analyzed via nucleic acid amplification techniques several
advantages, including minimal amounts blood, sample collection, simplified
storage shipping conditions room temperature. systematically
developed extensively evaluated procedure extract total nucleic acids
from used malaria rdts. co-extraction dna rna molecules small
volumes dried blood retained rdts allows detection quantification
of p. falciparum parasites asymptomatic patients parasite densities 
low 1 pf/µl blood using reverse transcription quantitative pcr. based the
extraction protocol developed enar (extraction nucleic acids 
rdts) approach; complete workflow large-scale molecular malaria
surveillance. using rdts collected malaria indicator survey we
demonstrated enar provides powerful tool analyze nucleic acids from
thousands rdts standardized high-throughput manner. found several,
known new, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms propeller
region kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating bioko island,
equatorial guinea.
