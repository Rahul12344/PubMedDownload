human babesiosis caused one several babesial species transmitted by
ixodid ticks distinct geographical distributions based presence 
of competent animal hosts. pathology babesiosis, like malaria, a
consequence parasitaemia develops cyclical replication
of babesia parasites patient's red blood cells, though symptoms typically
are nonspecific. identified gene encoding rhoptry-associated protein 
-1 (rap-1) human isolate b. divergens, rouen1987 characterized

which central clinical disease, characterising understanding role
of babesia-derived proteins involved steps great interest the
