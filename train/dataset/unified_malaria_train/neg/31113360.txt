background: arms race hosts parasites, genes involved the
immune response targets natural selection. toll-like receptor (tlr) genes
play role parasite detection part innate immune system whereas
major histocompatibility complex (mhc) genes encode proteins display
antigens part vertebrate adaptive immune system. thus, gene
families selection pressure pathogens. bananaquit (coereba
flaveola) passerine bird common host avian malarial parasites
(plasmodium sp. haemoproteus sp.). assessed molecular variation tlr and
mhc genes wild population bananaquits identified allelic associations
with resistance/susceptibility parasitic infection address hypotheses of
avian immune response haemosporidian parasites.
results: found allele frequencies associated infection status at
the immune loci studied. consistent general trend showed infected groups
possessed alleles lower frequencies, exhibited unique alleles,
compared uninfected group.
conclusions: results support theory natural selection favoring
particular alleles resistance maintaining overall genetic diversity 
the population, mechanism demonstrated systems mhc
previously understudied tlrs.
