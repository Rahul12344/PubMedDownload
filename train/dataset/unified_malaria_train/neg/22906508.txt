the sir2 family nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, collectively called
sirtuins, central interest due proposed roles life-span

protozoan parasites appear conserved intriguing unique
functions. review summarises current knowledge members the
sirtuin families apicomplexa, including plasmodium, protozoan
parasites trypanosoma leishmania. wide diversity processes
regulated sir2 proteins makes targets worthy exploitation in
anti-parasitic therapies.
