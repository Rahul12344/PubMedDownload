in deadly human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, several major
merozoite surface proteins (msps) show striking pattern allelic diversity
called allelic dimorphism (ad). ad, vast majority observed alleles fall
into two highly divergent allelic classes, recombinant alleles rare or
not observed, presumably due repression natural selection (recombination
suppression, rs). three ad loci, merozoite surface proteins (msps) 1, 2,
and 6, along msp3, also exhibits rs among four allelic classes, be
collectively called ad/rs. causes ad/rs evolutionary history of
allelic diversity loci remain mysterious. available sequences
from single closely related chimpanzee parasite, p. reichenowi, suggested 
that 3/4 loci, ad/rs ancient state retained p.
falciparum since well p. falciparum-p. reichenowi ancestor. the
other hand, based comparative sequence analysis, recently suggested that
(i) ad/rs p. falciparum loci undergone interallelic recombination over
longer evolutionary times (on timescale recent speciation events), and
thus (ii) ad/rs may recent phenomenon. recent publication genomic
sequencing efforts p. gaboni, outgroup p. falciparum p. reichenowi,
allows improved reconstruction evolutionary history loci. 
this work, report genic sequence p. gaboni four ad/rs p. falciparum
loci (msp1, 2, 3, 6). comparison sequences available p.
falciparum p. reichenowi data strengthens evidence interallelic
recombination evolutionary history species also strengthens
the case ad/rs loci ancient. combined previous results,
these data provide evidence ad/rs different loci evolved several
different times evolutionary history p. falciparum: (i) p.
gaboni-p. falciparum divergence, much msp1 msp3; (ii) p.
gaboni-p. falciparum p. reichenowi-p. falciparum divergences, 5' end 
of ad region msp6 block 3 msp1; (iii) near p. reichenowi-p.
falciparum divergence, 3' end ad region msp6; (iv) after
the p. reichenowi-p. falciparum divergence, msp2. based results, i
suggest new hypothesis long-term evolutionary maintenance ad/rs by
recombination within allelic groups.
