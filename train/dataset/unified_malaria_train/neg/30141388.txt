mutations chloroquine resistance transporter gene plasmodium falciparum
(pfcrt) associated drug susceptibility status chloroquine other
antimalarials interfere heme detoxification process including
artemisinin. aim investigate whether increase duration artemisinin
combination therapy (act) thailand could affect mutations pfcrt. the
complete coding sequences pfcrt dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr), size
polymorphisms merozoite surface proteins-1 2 (pfmsp-1 pfmsp-2) 
189 p. falciparum isolates collected 1991 2016 analyzed. in
total, 12 novel amino acid substitutions 13 novel pfcrt haplotypes were
identified. prevalent haplotype belonged dd2 sequence wild
type found. significant positive correlation frequency pfcrt
mutants year sample collection observed nationwide act
implementation (r = 0.780; p = 0.038). number haplotypes nucleotide
diversity isolates collected 3-day act (2009-2016) significantly
outnumbered collected treatment regimen. positive darwinian
selection occurred transmembrane domains among isolates collected
during 3-day act among collected period. remarkable 
change observed molecular indices loci analyzed similar
comparisons performed. increase duration artesunate in
combination therapy thailand could exert selective pressure pfcrt
locus, resulting emergence novel variants. impact novel
haplotypes antimalarial susceptibilities requires study.
