background: immune system adult mosquitoes received significant
attention ability females vector disease-causing pathogens
while ingesting blood meals. however, studies focused immune
system larvae, which, hypothesize, highly robust due high density
and diversity microorganisms larvae encounter aquatic
environments strong selection pressures work larval stage to
ensure survival reproductive maturity. here, surveyed broad range of
cellular humoral immune parameters larvae malaria mosquito,
anopheles gambiae, compared potency newly-emerged adults and
older adults.
results: found larvae kill bacteria hemocoel equal or
greater efficiency compared newly-emerged adults, antibacterial
ability declines adult age, indicative senescence. phenotype
correlates circulating hemocytes differing spatial arrangement of
sessile hemocytes larvae relative adults, well individual
hemocytes adults carrying greater phagocytic burden. hemolymph larvae
also possesses markedly stronger antibacterial lytic melanization activity
than hemolymph adults. finally, infection induces stronger
transcriptional upregulation immunity genes larvae adults,
including differences immunity genes regulated.
conclusions: results demonstrate immunity strongest larvae and
declines metamorphosis adult age, suggest adaptive
decoupling, independent evolution larval adult traits made possible
by metamorphosis, occurred mosquito lineage.
