background: central china declining incidence plasmodium vivax been
interrupted epidemic expansions imported cases. impact these
changes local parasite population, concurrent risks future
resurgence, assessed.
methods: plasmodium vivax isolates collected anhui jiangsu provinces,
central china 2007 2010 genotyped using capillary
electrophoresis seven polymorphic short tandem repeat markers. spatial and
temporal analyses within-host population diversity, population structure, 
and relatedness conducted isolates.
results: polyclonal infections infrequent 94 isolates anhui (4%)
and 25 jiangsu (12%), trend increasing frequency 2008 to
2010 (2 19%) combined. population diversity high provinces
and across years tested (h(e) = 0.8 - 0.85). differentiation anhui
and jiangsu modest (f'(st) = 0.1). several clusters isolates with
identical multi-locus haplotypes observed across anhui jiangsu.
linkage disequilibrium strong populations year tested
(i(a)(s) = 0.2 - 0.4), declined two- four-fold identical haplotypes
were accounted for, indicative occasional epidemic transmission dynamics. none
of five imported isolates shared identical haplotypes central
chinese isolates.
conclusions: population genetic structure p. vivax central china
highlights unstable transmission, limited barriers gene flow 
central provinces. despite low endemicity, population diversity remained high,
but reservoirs sustaining diversity remain unclear. challenge of
imported cases risks resurgence emphasize need continued
surveillance detect early warning signals. although parasite genotyping has
potential inform management outbreaks, studies required 
identify suitable marker panels resolving local imported p. vivax
isolates.
