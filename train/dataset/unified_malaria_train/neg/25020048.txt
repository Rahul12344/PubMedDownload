immunization strategies elicit antibodies capable neutralizing diverse
virus strains likely important part successful vaccine against
hiv. however, strategies promote robust humoral responses native
intact hiv envelope trimer structure lacking. recently developed
chemically cross-linked lipid nanocapsules carriers molecular adjuvants and
encapsulated surface-displayed antigens, promoted follicular helper
t-cell responses elicited high-avidity, durable antibody responses a
candidate malaria antigen. apply system delivery hiv antigens, 
env gp140 trimers terminal his-tags (gp140t-his) anchored the
surface lipid nanocapsules via ni-nta-functionalized lipids. initial
experiments revealed large (409 kda), heavily glycosylated trimers 
capable extracting fluid phase lipids membranes nanocapsules.
thus, liquid-ordered and/or gel-phase lipid compositions required stably 
anchor trimers particle membranes. trimer-loaded nanocapsules combined
with clinically relevant adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid primed high-titer
antibody responses mice antigen doses ranging 5 μg low 100
ng, whereas titers dropped 50-fold dose range when
soluble trimer mixed strong oil-in-water adjuvant comparator.
nanocapsule immunization also broadened number distinct epitopes the
hiv trimer recognized antibody response. results suggest that
nanocapsules displaying hiv trimers oriented, multivalent presentation 
promote key aspects humoral response env immunogens.
