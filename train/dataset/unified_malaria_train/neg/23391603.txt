background: malaria diagnosis, specific gene identification required in
cases subclinical infection cases mixed infection. study
applied biosensor technology based quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) to
differentially diagnose common severe malaria, plasmodium falciparum
and plasmodium vivax.
method: qcm surface immobilized malaria biotinylated probe. specific
dna fragments malaria-infected blood amplified. hybridization the
amplified products immobilized probe resulted quartz frequency shifts 
which measured in-house frequency counter. diagnostic potency and
clinical application malaria qcm evaluated.
result: malaria qcm could differentially diagnose blood infected p.
falciparum infected p. vivax (p-value<0.05). cross reaction
with human dna indicated qcm specificity. clinical application evaluated 
using 30 suspected samples. twenty-seven samples showed consistent diagnosis of
the qcm microscopy rapid diagnosis tests (rdts). three samples reported 
"no malaria found" microscopy showed p. falciparum infection qcm and
the rdts.
conclusion: malaria qcm developed high accuracy, specificity,
sensitivity, stability cost-effectiveness. field applicable malaria 
endemic area might promising point care testing.
