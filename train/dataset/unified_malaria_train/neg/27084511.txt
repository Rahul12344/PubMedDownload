background: recent emergence artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum posed a
serious hindrance elimination malaria greater mekong subregion. 
parasite clearance time, measure change peripheral parasitaemia a
sequence samples taken treatment, used reflect the
susceptibility parasites efficiency antimalarials. association
of genetic polymorphisms artemisinin resistance documented. this
study aims examine clearance time p. falciparum p. vivax parasitemia as
well putative gene mutations associated residual recurred parasitemia 
in myanmar.
methods: total 63 p. falciparum 130 p. vivax samples collected two 
internally-displaced populations one surrounding village examined for
parasitemia changes. least four samples taken patient, the
first day diagnosis 3 months following initial treatment. amount
of parasite gene copy number estimated using quantitative real-time pcr based
on species-specific region 18s rrna gene. samples showed
residual recurred parasitemia treatment, microsatellites used to
identify 'post-treatment' parasite genotype compared the
'pre-treatment' genotype. mutations genes pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfatp6, pfmrp1 and
pfk13 potentially associated act resistance examined to
identify mutation factor residual persistent parasitemia.
results: 30% p. falciprium infections showed delayed clearance of
parasitemia 2-3 days treatment 9.5% showed recurred parasitemia.
mutations codon 876 pfmrp1 corroborated significance association with
slow clearance time. however, association observed variation in
pfmdr1 gene copy number well mutations various codonsinpfatp6, pfcrt,
and pfk13 clearance time. p. vivax, 95% infections indicated
cleared parasitemia days 2-3 treatment. four samples found be
re-infected new parasite strains based microsatellite genotypes after
initial treatment.
conclusion: appearance p.falciparum infected samples showing delayed
clearance recurred parasitemia treatment raises concerns current
treatment act drug resistance.
