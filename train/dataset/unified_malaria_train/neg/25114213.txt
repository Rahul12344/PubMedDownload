malaria caused plasmodium falciparum kills nearly one million children each
year imposes crippling economic burdens families nations worldwide. no
licensed vaccine exists, infection prevented antibodies the
circumsporozoite protein (csp), major surface protein sporozoites, the
form parasite injected mosquitoes. used vectored
immunoprophylaxis (vip), adeno-associated virus-based technology, introduce
preformed antibody genes encoding anti-p. falciparum csp mab mice. vip
vector-transduced mice exhibited long-lived mab expression 1,200 Âµg/ml
in serum, 70% protected i.v. mosquito bite challenge
with transgenic plasmodium berghei rodent sporozoites incorporate p.
falciparum target mab csp. serum antibody levels protection
from mosquito bite challenge dependent dose vip vector. all
individual mice expressing csp-specific mab 2a10 1 mg/ml were
completely protected, suggesting model system, exceeding that
threshold results consistent sterile protection. results demonstrate the
potential vip path toward elusive goal immunization against
malaria.
