development insecticide resistance (ir) mosquito vectors primary
huddle malaria control program. since ir genetic basis, genes
constantly evolve response environment adaptation organisms, is
important know evolutionary pattern genes conferring ir malaria vectors.
the mosquito anopheles minimus major malaria vector southeast (se)
asia india susceptible insecticides, thus interest to
know natural selection shaped variations gene conferring ir. if
not, dna fragment gene could used infer population structure 
and demography species malaria vector. therefore sequenced a
~569 bp dna segment nadph cytochrome p450 reductase (cpr) gene (widely
known confer ir) in 123 individuals an. minimus collected 10 different
locations (eight indian, one thai one vietnamese). two indian population
samples completely mono-morphic cpr gene. general, low genetic
diversity found evidence natural selection gene. data 
were therefore analyzed infer population structure demography this
species. the 10 populations could genetically differentiated four
different groups; samples thailand vietnam contained high nucleotide
diversity. 10 populations conform demographic equilibrium model with
signature past population expansion four populations. results in
general indicate an. minimus mosquitoes sampled two se asian
localities contain several genetic characteristics parts the
ancestral population.
