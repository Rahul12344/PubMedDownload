malaria parasites unicellular organisms residing inside red blood cells, 
and current methods editing parasite genes inefficient. the
crispr/cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats cas9
endonuclease-mediated genome editing) system new powerful technique for
genome editing widely employed study gene function various
organisms. however, whether technique applied modify genomes
of malaria parasites determined. paper, demonstrated that
cas9 able introduce site-specific dna double-strand breaks the
plasmodium yoelii genome repaired homologous recombination.
by supplying engineered homologous repair templates, generated targeted
deletion, reporter knock-in, nucleotide replacement multiple parasite
genes, achieving 100% efficiency gene deletion 22 45%
efficiencies knock-in allelic replacement. results establish
methodologies introducing desired modifications p. yoelii genome 
high efficiency accuracy, greatly improve ability study
gene function malaria parasites. importance: malaria, caused infection of
plasmodium parasites, remains world-wide public health burden. although the
genomes many malaria parasites sequenced, still know the
functions approximately half genes genomes. studying gene
function become focus many studies; however, editing genes malaria 
parasite genomes still inefficient. designed several efficient
approaches, based crispr/cas9 system, introduce site-specific dna
double-strand breaks plasmodium yoelii genome repaired through
homologous recombination. using system, achieved high efficiencies in
gene deletion, reporter tagging, allelic replacement multiple parasite
genes. technique editing malaria parasite genome greatly
facilitate ability elucidate gene function.
