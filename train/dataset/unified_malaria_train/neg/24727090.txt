population genetic studies used understand transmission of
pathogens humans animals, especially role zoonotic infections and
evolution dispersal virulent subtypes. study, analysed the
genetic diversity population structure cryptosporidium meleagridis, the
only known cryptosporidium species infects avian mammalian hosts
and responsible approximately 10% human cryptosporidiosis some
areas. total 62 c. meleagridis specimens children, aids patients, and
birds lima, peru characterised sequence analysis ssrrna gene
and five minisatellite, microsatellite polymorphic markers chromosome 6,
including 60 kda glycoprotein (gp60), 47 kda glycoprotein (cp47), serine
repeat antigen (msc6-5), retinitis pigmentosa gtpase regulator (rpgr) and
thrombospondin protein 8 (tsp8). multilocus sequence analysis identified
concurrent infections cryptosporidium hominis four aids patients and
three children. unique subtypes c. meleagridis ranged eight gp60
locus (gene diversity -hd=0.651), three rpgr (hd=0.556), three the
msc6-5 locus (hd=0.242), two tsp8 (hd=0.198), one cp47 (monomorphic),
much lower c. hominis area. intragenic linkage
disequilibrium strong complete gene loci. intergenic linkage
disequilibrium highly significant (p<0.001) pairs polymorphic
loci. two major groups subtypes seen, subtypes belonging to
group 1. within group 1, clear population segregation, two of
the 14 multilocus subtypes c. meleagridis found aids patients and
birds. believe results provide first evidence clonal
population structure c. meleagridis likely occurrence cross-species
transmission c. meleagridis birds humans.
