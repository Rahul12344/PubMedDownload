the frequency hla-b27 patients ankylosing spondylitis (as) over
85%. 170 recognized hla-b27 alleles majority 
is sufficiently represented genetic association studies. far two 
alleles, hla-b*2706 asia hla-b*2709 sardinia, been
found associated as. highly homogenous genetic structure the
sardinian population favored search relevant variants for
disease-association studies. moreover, malaria, endemic island, has
been shown contributed shape native population genome affecting
the relative allele frequency relevant genes. sardinia, prevalence of
hla-b*2709, differs strongly as-associated b*2705 prototype for
one amino acid (his/asp116) f pocket peptide binding groove, is
around 20% hla-b27 alleles. previously hypothesized malaria
could contributed establishment allele sardinia. based 
our recent findings, perspective article speculate the
endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidases, erap1 2, associated and
involved antigen presentation, underwent co-selection malaria. genes,
besides shaping immunopeptidome hla-class molecules, other
biological functions could also involved immunosurveillance
against malaria.
