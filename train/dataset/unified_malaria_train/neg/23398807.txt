pigeon protozoal encephalitis (ppe) emerging central-nervous disease of
domestic pigeons (columba livia f. domestica) reported germany united 
states. caused apicomplexan parasite sarcocystis calchasi is

such toxoplasma plasmodium, knowledge pathophysiology and
host manipulation sarcocystis scarce almost nothing known ppe.
here show mrna expression profiling significant down-modulation the
interleukin (il)-12/il-18/interferon (ifn)-γ axis brains experimentally
infected pigeons schizogonic phase disease. concomitantly, no
cellular immune response observed histopathology while
immunohistochemistry nested pcr detected s. calchasi. contrast, the
late central-nervous phase, ifn-γ tumor necrosis factor (tnf) α-related
cytokines significantly up-modulated, correlated prominent
mhc-ii protein expression areas mononuclear cell infiltration necrosis.
the mononuclear cell fraction mainly composed t-lymphocytes, fewer
macrophages b-lymphocytes. surprisingly, severity composition 
immune cell response appears unrelated infectious dose, although the
severity onset central nervous signs clearly dose-dependent. we
identified tissue cysts immunohistochemistry pigeons
with severe encephalitis one pigeon repeatedly remained negative pcr 
despite severe lesions. taken together, observations may suggest immune 
evasion strategy s. calchasi early phase delayed-type
hypersensitivity reaction cause extensive cerebral lesions the
