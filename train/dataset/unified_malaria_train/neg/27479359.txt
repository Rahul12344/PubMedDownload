hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransference (hgxprt), key enzyme
in purine salvage pathway malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum
(pf), catalyses conversion hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine their
corresponding mononucleotides; imp, gmp, xmp, respectively. five
active site loops (i, ii, iii, iii', iv) pfhgxprt, loop iii' facilitates
the closure hood core domain penultimate step during
enzymatic catalysis. pfhgxprt mutants constructed wherein trp 181 loop
iii' substituted ser, thr, tyr, phe. mutants (w181s, w181y and
w181f), examined xanthine phosphoribosylation activity, showed an
increase km prpp 2.1-3.4 fold unactivated condition a
decrease catalytic efficiency 5-fold activated condition as
compared wild-type enzyme. w181t mutant showed 10-fold reduced
xanthine phosphoribosylation activity. furthermore, molecular dynamics
simulations wt silico w181s/y/f/t pfhgxprt mutants bound to

on overall dynamics systems identify local changes loop iii'.
dynamic cross-correlation analyses show communication loop iii' the
substrate binding site. differential cross-correlation maps indicate altered
communication among different regions mutants. changes local
