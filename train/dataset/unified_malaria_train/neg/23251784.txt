the coexistence multiple independently circulating strains pathogen
populations undergo sexual recombination central question of
epidemiology profound implications control. agent-based model is
developed extends earlier 'strain theory' addressing var gene family 
of plasmodium falciparum. model explicitly considers extensive diversity 
of multi-copy genes undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually
exclusive expression. tracks dynamics unique var repertoires a
population hosts, shows even high levels sexual
recombination, strain competition mediated cross-immunity structures 
parasite population subset coexisting dominant repertoires var genes
whose degree antigenic overlap depends transmission intensity. empirical
comparison patterns genetic variation antigenic neutral sites
supports role immune selection structuring parasite
