the vivo antimalarial efficacies two phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (pi4k)
inhibitors, 3,5-diaryl-2-aminopyrazine sulfoxide corresponding sulfone 
metabolite, evaluated nod-scid il2rγnull (nsg) murine malaria disease
model plasmodium falciparum infection. hypothesized sulfoxide
would serve soluble prodrug sulfone, would lead to
improved drug exposure oral dosing. compounds similar efficacy (90%
effective dose [ed90], 0.1 mg kg-1 body weight) across quadruple-dose
regimen. pharmacokinetic profiling revealed rapid sulfoxide clearance via
conversion sulfone, sulfone identified major active metabolite.
when sulfoxide dosed, exposure sulfone achieved much as
2.9-fold higher sulfone directly dosed, thereby demonstrating
that sulfoxide served effective prodrug treatment malaria.
