salivary gland proteins female aedes aegypti mosquito extracted and
analyzed high-resolution mass spectrometry. proteomic data analysed using 
two search algorithms sequest mascot, results acquisition 83,836 
spectra assigned 5417 peptides belonging 1208 proteins.these
proteins assigned molecular functions analysis revealed
biological processes involved using gene ontology annotations.
several immunity related pathways found enriched salivary gland.the
data study also related research article "mosquito-borne
diseases omics: salivary gland proteome female aedes aegypti mosquito"
