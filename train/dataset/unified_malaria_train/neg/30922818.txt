background: resistance plasmodium falciparum sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
threatens antimalarial effectiveness intermittent preventive treatment
during pregnancy (iptp) sub-saharan africa. aimed assess the
associations markers sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance p
falciparum effectiveness sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine iptp for
malaria-associated outcomes.
methods: systematic review meta-analysis, searched databases
(from jan 1, 1990 march 1, 2018) clinical studies (aggregated data) or
surveys (individual participant data) reported data low birthweight
(primary outcome) malaria sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine iptp dose, for
studies reported molecular markers sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance. studies involved hiv-infected women combined
interventions excluded. random-effects meta-analysis (clinical
studies) multivariate log-binomial regression (surveys) obtain summarised
dose-response data (relative risk reduction [rrr]) multivariate
meta-regression explore modifying effects sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance (as indicated ala437gly, lys540glu, ala581gly substitutions 
the dhps gene). study registered prospero, number 42016035540.
findings: 1097 records screened, 57 studies included the
aggregated-data meta-analysis (including 59 457 births). rrr low
birthweight declined increasing prevalence dhps lys540glu (ptrend=0·0060)
but ala437gly (ptrend=0·35). rrr 7% (95% ci 0 13) areas high
resistance sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (lys540glu ≥90% east southern
africa; n=11), 21% (14 29) moderate-resistance areas (ala437gly ≥90%
[central west africa], lys540glu ≥30% <90% [east southern africa]; 
n=16), 27% (21 33) low-resistance areas (ala437gly <90% [central and
west africa], lys540glu <30% [east southern africa]; n=30; ptrend=0·0054
[univariate], i2=69·5%). overall rrr resistance strata 21% (17 
25). analysis individual participant data 13 surveys (42 394
births), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine iptp associated reduced prevalence of
low birthweight areas lys540glu prevalence 90% and
ala581gly prevalence less 10% (rrr 10% [7 12]), 
an ala581gly prevalence 10% higher (pooled ala581gly prevalence 37% [range 
29 46]; rrr 0·5% [-16 14]; 2326 births).
interpretation: effectiveness sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine iptp reduced in
areas high resistance sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine among p falciparum
parasites, remains associated reductions low birthweight even in
areas dhps lys540glu prevalence exceeds 90% sextuple-mutant
parasite (harbouring additional dhps ala581gly mutation) uncommon.
therapeutic alternatives sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine iptp needed areas
where prevalence sextuple-mutant parasite exceeds 37%.
funding: us centers disease control prevention, malaria pregnancy 
consortium (funded grant bill & melinda gates foundation to
the liverpool school tropical medicine), worldwide antimalarial resistance
network, european developing countries clinical trials partnership.
