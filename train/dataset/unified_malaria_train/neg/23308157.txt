the important role histone posttranslational modifications, particularly
methylation acetylation, plasmodium falciparum gene regulation been
established. however, role histone phosphorylation remains understudied.
here, investigate histone phosphorylation utilizing liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry analyze histones extracted asexual blood stages 
using two improved protocols enhance preservation ptms. enrichment for
phosphopeptides lead detection 14 histone phospho-modifications p.
falciparum. majority phosphorylation sites observed n-terminal
regions various histones frequently observed adjacent acetylated
lysines. also report identification one novel member p.
falciparum histone phosphosite binding protein repertoire, pf14-3-3i. recombinant
pf14-3-3i protein bound purified parasite histones. silico structural
analysis pf14-3-3 proteins revealed residues responsible binding to
histone h3 s10ph and/or s28ph conserved primary tertiary
structure levels. using battery h3 specific phosphopeptides, demonstrate 
that pf14-3-3i preferentially binds h3s28ph h3s10ph, independent of
modification neighbouring residues like h3s10phk14ac h3s28phs32ph. our
data provide key insight histone phosphorylation sites. identification
of second member histone modification reading machinery suggests a
widespread use histone phosphorylation control various nuclear
processes malaria parasites.
