dna vaccines offer cost, flexibility, stability advantages, administered 
alone limited immunogenicity. previously, identified optimal
configurations magnetic vectors comprising superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (spions), polyethylenimine (pei), hyaluronic acid (ha) to
deliver malaria dna encoding plasmodium yoelii (py) merozoite surface protein
msp119 (spions/pei/dna + ha gene complex) dendritic cells transfect them
with high efficiency vitro. herein, evaluate immunogenicity vivo
by administering potential vaccine complexes balb/c mice. the
complexes induced antibodies pymsp119, higher responses induced
intraperitoneally intramuscularly, antibody levels enhanced by
applying external magnetic field. predominant igg subclasses induced 
igg2a followed igg1 igg2b. complexes elicited high levels of
interferon gamma (ifn-Î³), moderate levels interleukin (il)-4 il-17
antigen-specific splenocytes, indicating induction helper 1 (th1), th2, 
th17 cell mediated immunity. ability dna/nanoparticle complexes to
induce cytophilic antibodies together broad spectrum cellular immunity may
benefit malaria vaccines.
