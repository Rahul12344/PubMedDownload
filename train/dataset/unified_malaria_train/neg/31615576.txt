background: gene drive mosquitoes proposed possible means to
reduce transmission malaria africa. technology no
prior use-history time, environmental risk assessments gene drive
mosquitoes benefit problem formulation-an organized ordered process
to identify protection goals potential pathways harm environment,
or animal human health. recognizing need, new partnership for
africa's development (nepad), support african international
partners, organized four regional consultative workshops africa initiate
this process.
methods: workshops attended diverse set participants and
stakeholders, including scientists, ethicists, health professionals, government
regulators fields environment health biosafety well government
policymakers, met 4Â days deliberate protection goals pathways
relevant use gene drive mosquitoes malaria control. goal the
workshops produce comprehensive detailed environmental risk
assessment gene drive mosquitoes, rather introduce problem formulation 
as tool stakeholder community, serve starting point for
conducting systematic environmental risk assessments future, identifying
protection goals related gene drive mosquitoes particular african 
stakeholders.
results: participants workshops frequently identified human health and
biodiversity relevant broad protection goals. results the
deliberations provide insight concerns african participants an
early stage development gene drive organism/products be
instructive developers using technology.
conclusions: general, african participants consultations a
precautionary perspective regard environmental risk assessment gene
drive technology. gene drive technology develops, protection goals become
further refined candidate products defined. workshops
represent beginning continuing process ultimately inform 
environmental risk assessment gene drive mosquitoes control malaria in
africa.
