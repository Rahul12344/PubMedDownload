cerebral malaria (cm) deadly complication plasmodium falciparum
infection, specific interactions involved cerebral homing infected
erythrocytes (ies) poorly understood. study, p. falciparum-ies were
characterized binding primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(hbmecs). selection, cd36 icam-1-binding parasites exhibited punctate
binding subpopulation hbmecs binding cd36 dependent. panning of
ies hbmecs led dispersed binding phenotype selection of
three var genes, including two encode tandem domain cassette 8 (dc8) and
were non-cd36 binders. multiple domains dc8 cassette bound brain
endothelium cysteine-rich interdomain region 1 inhibited binding p.
falciparum-ies 50%, highlighting key role dc8 cassette cerebral
binding. mysterious deadly binding variants maintained the
parasite population. clonal parasite lines expressing two brain-adherent
dc8-var genes bind known microvascular receptors,
indicating unique receptors involved cerebral binding. could also
adhere brain, lung, dermis, heart endothelial cells, suggesting cerebral
binding variants may alternative sequestration sites. furthermore, young
african children cm nonsevere control cases antibodies to
hbmec-selected parasites, indicating exposed related variants
during childhood infections. analysis shows specific p. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 types linked cerebral binding suggests 
a potential mechanism individuals may build immunity severe
disease, absence cm.
