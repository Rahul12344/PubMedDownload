six hsp70-like genes represented genome plasmodium falciparum. of
these two occur cytosol: p. falciparum hsp70-z (pfhsp70-z) pfhsp70-1. 
pfhsp70-1 well characterised canonical hsp70 facilitates protein
quality control crucial development malaria parasites. is
very little known pfhsp70-z. however, pfhsp70-z known essential
and implicated suppressing aggregation asparagine-rich proteins p.
falciparum. addition, expression clinical stage malaria
correlates disease prognosis. based structural evidence pfhsp70-z belongs
to hsp110 family proteins. since hsp110 proteins described as
nucleotide exchange factors (nefs) canonical hsp70 counterparts, 
been speculated pfhsp70-z may serve nef pfhsp70-1. current
study, p. falciparum cells cultured vitro subjected heat stress,
triggering enhanced expression pfhsp70-z. biochemical assays conducted
using recombinant pfhsp70-z protein demonstrated protein heat stable 
and possesses atpase activity. furthermore, observed pfhsp70-z capable
of self-association. structural-functional features pfhsp70-z provide
further evidence role chaperone possible nucleotide exchange
factor pfhsp70-1.
