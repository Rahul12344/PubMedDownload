objective: establish multiplex pcr detection system identifying 4 human 
plasmodium species evaluate applicability.
methods: sequences 18s rdna gene 4 human plasmodium species were
compared using dnaman software, 4 downstream primers designed using
oligo 6.0 software, targeted region variability conserved
regions 5 6 sequences. using primers, specificity and
sensitivity multiplex pcr system evaluated, plasmids containing 
the 18s rdna gene sequence template. further, new nest pcr system (m-nest)
was established combining multiplex pcr system first-cycle
genus-specific primer np-1993 system. sensitivities multiplex
pcr system m-nest system evaluated serial dilutions blood dna 
samples patients infected p. falciparum p. vivax. addition, the
np-1993 m-nest systems applied screen plasmodium species 307
blood samples people returning guangxi ghana, malaria epidemic
area. np-2002 m-nest systems applied re-check plasmodium
species 66 blood samples collected guangxi 2014 january may, 
were identified microscopy infected mainly p. ovale.
results: sizes multiplex pcr products p. falciparum, p. vivax, p.
ovale, p. malariae 268 bp, 323 bp, 394 bp, 446 bp, respectively,
located in-between 50-bp dna ladders. however, melting curves similar
tm values, thus could used identify 4 species. minimum
detection limits p. falciparum, p. malariae, p. ovale, p. vivax 18s rdna
gene multiplex pcr system 5.58x102, 1.56x103, 1.66x103, 1.80 x
10(2) copies/[a. minimum detection limit blood dna falciparum malaria
patients multiplex pcr system 1.43 x 10(2)-8.84 x 10(3) copies/p.1 
5.10 x 10-4.92 x 10(2) parasites/Âµl, higher p. vivax (17.4-69.1
copies/l 13.5-83.2 parasites/p). compared multiples pcr system, 
m-nest system reduced minimum detection limit plasmodium 10-100
folds. further, m-nest np-1993 systems reached inconsistent detection
results 307 blood samples people returned ghana; former
detected 2 cases p. ovale infection latter failed. addition, 
np-2002 m-nest systems came results re-checking plasmodium
species 66 blood samples.
conclusion: established multiplex pcr system identify 4 human plasmodium 
species simultaneously good applicability practice.
