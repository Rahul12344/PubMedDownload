malaria pregnancy (mip) distinctive clinical form plasmodium infection
and cause placental insufficiency leading poor pregnancy outcomes.
maternal innate immunity responses play decisive role development of
placental inflammation, action fetus-derived factors mip outcomes
has overlooked. investigated role tlr4 ifnar1 genes,
taking advantage heterogenic mating strategies dissect effects mediated
by maternally fetally derived toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) type i
interferon receptor 1 (ifnar1). using mouse infection system displaying severe 
mip outcomes, found expressions tlr4 ifnar1 maternal
compartment take part deleterious mip outcomes, fetal counterparts
patently counteract effects. uncovered fetal tlr4 contributes to
the vitro uptake infected erythrocytes trophoblasts innate
immune response placenta, offering robust protection fetus viability,
but sensible impact placental parasite burden. contrast, we
observed expression ifnar1 fetal compartment associated
with reduced placental parasite burden little beneficial effect on
fetus outcomes. furthermore, downregulation ifnar1 expression infected 
placentas trophoblasts exposed infected erythrocytes indicated the
interferon-ifnar1 pathway involved trophoblast response infection.
this work unravels maternal fetal counterparts innate immune pathways
drive opposing responses murine placental malaria implicates the
activation innate receptors fetal trophoblast cells control of
placental infection protection fetus.
