synthetic sex distorters recently developed malaria mosquito,
relying endonucleases target x-chromosome spermatogenesis.
although inspired naturally-occurring traits, remained unclear they
function and, given potential genetic control, portable this
strategy across species. established drosophila models two distinct
mechanisms crispr/cas9 sex-ratio distortion-"x-shredding" and
"x-poisoning"-and dissected target-site requirements repair dynamics.
x-shredding resulted sex distortion cas9 endonuclease activity occurred
during meiotic stages spermatogenesis cas9 expressed from
the stem cell stages onwards. results suggest x-shredding is
counteracted nhej dna repair pathway operate single repeat
cluster non-essential sequences, although targeting number such
repeats effect sex ratio. x-poisoning contrast, i.e. targeting
putative haplolethal genes x chromosome, induced high bias towards males
(>92%) directed cas9 cleavage x-linked ribosomal target gene rps6.
in case x-poisoning sex distortion coupled loss reproductive
output, although dominant-negative effect appeared drive mechanism of
female lethality. model systems guide study application of
sex distorters medically agriculturally important insect target species.
