background: asthma caused combination different factors. current
concepts asthma pathogenesis emphasize gene-environment interactions.
mega-genome scanning projects revealed different single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) related asthma susceptibility. rs7216389-t one 
them related childhood asthma effect childhood asthma
severity proved different nations, however study been
performed eastern mediterranean middle east countries yet.
methods: perform population genetic studies, rapid high-throughput
screening method necessary. high-resolution melting analysis rapid,
powerful accurate method, suitable type studies.
therefore, decided develop high-resolution melting method for
rs7216389 locus genotyping iranian asthmatic children. current study, a
high-resolution melting analysis method based sybr green-i developed to
check frequency rs7216389-t mutation iranian asthmatic children the
first time.
results: second third classes intercalating dyes commonly used for
high-resolution melting method. however, study, sybr green-i used for
rs7216389 locus genotyping first time. results 60 samples showed 
that sybr green-i good efficacy rs7216389 locus genotyping through
high-resolution melting method comparison pcr-rflp sequencing.
conclusion: comparison results based hrm analysis pcr-rflp showed 
that developed method rapid, accurate, high-throughput economic to
study rs7216389 locus asthmatic children applicable other
similar population genetic studies.
