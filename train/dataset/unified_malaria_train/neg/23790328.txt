objective: characterize genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum (p.
falciparum) field isolates children lafia, north-central nigeria, using
the highly polymorphic p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2) gene 
molecular marker.
methods: three hundred twenty children enrolled study between
2005 2006. included 140 children presented uncomplicated
malaria dalhatu araf specialist hospital, lafia another 180 children
from study area asymptomatic infection. dna extracted blood
spot filter paper msp-2 genes genotyped using allele-specific nested 
pcr order analyze genetic diversity parasite isolates.
results: total 31 34 distinct msp-2 alleles identified the
asymptomatic uncomplicated malaria groups respectively. difference was
found multiplicity infection asymptomatic group of
the uncomplicated malaria group (p>0.05). however, isolates fc27 allele
type dominant asymptomatic group whereas isolates 3d7 allele
type dominant uncomplicated malaria group.
conclusions: study showed high genetic diversity p. falciparum isolates
in north-central nigeria comparable reports similar areas with
high malaria transmission intensity.
