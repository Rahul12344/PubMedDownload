matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) involved many physiological and
pathological processes. regards parasitic infections, role these
proteins particularly studied malaria, neurocysticercosis and
angiostrongyloidosis. recently, evaluated serum levels mmp-9 -2
(gelatinases) mice experimentally infected trichinella spiralis or
trichinella pseudospiralis, cause different degrees myositis we
found significant increase former and, lesser extent, the
latter, thus suggesting possibility gelatinases, particularly
mmp-9, represent marker inflammation. aim evaluate levels 
mmp-9 2 trichinellosis patients, assess possible clinical
significance. serum samples 31 trichinella britovi-infected individuals (20 
males 11 females), living tuscany, central italy, analysed mmp-9 
and mmp-2 serum levels. patients acquired infection trichinella after
consuming raw undercooked meat wild boar. median age 49±0.33years
(range 7 91). sera collected starting anti-inflammatory
treatment, aliquoted stored -20°c use. sera healthy subjects
was considered controls. gelatinolytic activity mmps analysed by
gelatin zymography 8% polyacrylamide-sds gels containing 0.1% porcine gelatin,
under non-reducing conditions. clear bands corresponding digested areas
were evaluated appropriate software. mmp-9 levels additionally
determined 15 patients using commercial elisa kit human mmp-9. the
zymographic analysis gels showed presence serum samples of
gelatinase bands approximately 125-kda, 92-kda 72-kda, corresponding to
the mmp-9/neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) complex proenzyme
forms mmp-9 mmp-2, respectively. significant (p<0.01) increase in
gelatinolytic activity patients compared control group observed for
pro-mmp-9 25 31. mean increase activity 39.25%±16.67%. no
significant differences observed pro-mmp-2 activity. mmp-9 levels
detected elisa showed significant correlation zymographic data (r2=0.62, 
p<0.003) higher affected patients (suffering diarrhea, facial
edemas myalgia). conclusion, mmp-9 might considered marker of
inflammation t. britovi patients. contrary, mmp-2 result
significantly different patients, compared controls.
