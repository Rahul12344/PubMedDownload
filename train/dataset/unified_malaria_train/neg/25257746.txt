the apicomplexa phylum parasitic protozoa, includes malaria
parasite plasmodium, amongst species devastate human animal
health. past decade seen release genome sequences many 
most important apicomplexan species, providing excellent basis improving
our understanding biology. one key features genome a
unique set large, variant gene families. although closely related species
share families, even different types malaria parasite distinct
families. species tend found ends chromosomes, which
may facilitate aspects gene expression regulation generation sequence
diversity. others scattered apparently randomly across chromosomes.
for families evidence involved antigenic variation,
immune regulation immune evasion. others known functions.
even function unknown families often predicted be
exposed host, contain much sequence diversity evolve rapidly. based on
these properties clear forefront host-parasite
interactions. review compare contrast genomic context, gene
structure, gene expression, protein localization function families
across different species.
