background: native gut microbiota anopheles mosquitoes known play 
key role physiological function host. interestingly, this
microbiota also influence development plasmodium host
mosquitoes. recent years, much interest shown employment of
gut symbionts derived vectors control vector-borne disease
transmission. study, midgut microbial diversity been
characterized among laboratory-reared adult anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, 
the colony created rearing progeny wild-caught mosquitoes (obtained from
three different locations southern india) multiple generations, using 16s 
ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing approach. further, influence native
midgut microbiota mosquitoes development rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei host studied.
methods: microbial diversity associated midgut an. stephensi
mosquitoes studied sequencing v3 region 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. 
the influence native midgut microbiota an. stephensi mosquitoes the
susceptibility mosquitoes rodent malaria parasite p. berghei was
studied comparing intensity prevalence p. berghei infection among
the antibiotic treated untreated cohorts mosquitoes.
results: analysis bacterial diversity midguts an. stephensi
showed proteobacteria dominant population among three
laboratory-reared strains an. stephensi studied. major genera identified among
these mosquito strains acinetobacter, pseudomonas, prevotella,
corynebacterium, veillonella, bacillus. mosquito infectivity studies
carried determine implication total midgut microbiota p. berghei
infection showed mosquitoes whose native microbiota cleared antibiotics
had increased susceptibility p. berghei infection compared antibiotic
untreated mosquitoes natural native microbiota.
conclusions: use microbial symbiont reduce competence vectors
involved disease transmission gained much importance recent years an
emerging alternative approach towards disease control. context, the
present study aimed identify midgut microbiota composition an.
stephensi, effect development p. berghei. interestingly, the
analysis midgut microbiota an. stephensi revealed presence genus
veillonella anopheles species first time. importantly, study also 
revealed negative influence total midgut microbiota development 
p. berghei three laboratory strains an. stephensi, emphasizing the
importance understanding gut microbiota malaria vectors, its
relationship parasite development designing strategies control malaria
transmission.
