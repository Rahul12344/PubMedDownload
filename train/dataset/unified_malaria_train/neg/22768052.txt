plasmodium falciparum: apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) candidate malaria
vaccine antigen expressed merozoites sporozoites. polymorphic nature
of ama1 may compromise vaccine induced protection. humoral response induced
by two dosages (10 50 µg) single allele ama1 antigen (fvo) formulated
with alhydrogel, montanide isa 720 as02 investigated 47 malaria-naïve
adult volunteers. volunteers vaccinated 3 times 4 weekly intervals and
serum samples obtained four weeks third immunization analysed 
(i) antibody responses various allelic variants, (ii) domain specificity,
(iii) avidity, (iv) igg subclass levels, elisa (v) functionality of
antibody responses growth inhibition assay (gia). half antibodies
induced vaccination cross reacted heterologous ama1 alleles. choice
of adjuvant determined magnitude antibody response, a
marginal influence specificity, avidity, domain recognition subclass
responses. highest antibody responses observed ama1 formulated 
as02. growth inhibition assay activity antibodies proportional 
the amount antigen specific igg functional capacity antibodies 
was similar heterologous ama1-expressing laboratory strains.trial
