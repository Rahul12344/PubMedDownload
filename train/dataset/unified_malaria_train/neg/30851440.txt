artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) forms first line malaria
treatment. however, yield fluctuation artemisinin remained unsolved
problem meeting global demand act. problem mainly caused by
the glandular trichome (gt)-specific biosynthesis artemisinin currently
used artemisia annua cultivars. here, report non-gt cells of
self-pollinated inbred a. annua plants express artemisinin biosynthetic
pathway. gene expression analysis demonstrated transcription six known
pathway genes gt-free leaves calli inbred a. annua plants.
lc-qtof-ms/ms analysis showed two types gt-free materials produce
artemisinin, artemisinic acid, arteannuin b. detailed ir-maldesi image
profiling revealed three metabolites dihydroartemisinin are
localized non-gt cells leaves of inbred a. annua plants. moreover, we
employed approaches examine artemisinin biosynthesis the
reported a. annua glandless (gl) mutant. resulting data demonstrated that
leaves regenerated gl plantlets biosynthesize artemisinin. collectively, these
findings add new knowledge leading revision current dogma of
artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua but also may expedite innovation novel
metabolic engineering approaches high stable production artemisinin in
the future.
