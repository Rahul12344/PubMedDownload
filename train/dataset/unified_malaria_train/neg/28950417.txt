human leukocyte antigen (hla) genes play key role immune response to
infectious diseases, highly prevalent specific environments,
like malaria sub-saharan africa. former case-control studies showed one
particular hla-b allele, b*53, associated malaria protection gambia, 
but hypothesis tested far within population genetics framework.
in study, objective assess whether pathogen-driven selection
associated malaria contributed shape hla-b genetic landscape of
africa. aim, first typed hla-a -b loci 484 individuals from
11 populations living different environments across sahel, analysed
these data together available 29 populations using several
approaches including linear modelling various genetic, geographic and
environmental parameters. addition relevant signatures populations'
demography migrations history genetic differentiation patterns both
hla-a -b loci, found frequencies three hla alleles, b*53, b*78
and a*74, significantly associated plasmodium falciparum malaria
prevalence, suggesting increase pathogen-driven selection in
malaria-endemic environments. two hla-b alleles identified, by
high-throughput sequencing, b*53:01:01 (in putative linkage disequilibrium
with one hla-c allele, c*04:01:01:01) b*78:01 one individuals
tested, making appropriate candidates malaria protection. results
highlight role environmental factors evolution hla
polymorphism open key perspectives functional studies focusing hla
peptide-binding properties.
