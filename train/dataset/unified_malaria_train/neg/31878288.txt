microglia chief immune cells brain reported be
activated severe malaria. activation may drive towards neuroinflammation
in cerebral malaria. malaria-infected red blood cell derived-extracellular
vesicles (mirevs) produced blood stage malaria infection. 
mediate intercellular communication immune regulation, among functions.
during cerebral malaria, breakdown blood-brain barrier promote the
migration substances mirevs periphery brain,
targeting cells microglia. microglia extracellular vesicle
interactions different pathological conditions reported induce
neuroinflammation. unlike astrocytes, microglia-extracellular vesicle
interaction yet described malaria infection. therefore, this
study, aimed investigate uptake mirevs human microglia cells 
their cytokine response. human blood monocyte-derived microglia (momi) were
generated buffy coats anonymous healthy donors using ficoll-paque density
gradient centrifugation. mirevs isolated plasmodium falciparum 
cultures. purified ultracentrifugation labeled pkh67 green 
fluorescent dye. internalization mirevs momi observed 4 h 
co-incubation coverslips placed 24-well plate 37 °c using confocal
microscopy. cytokine-gene expression investigated using rt-qpcr, following
the stimulation momi cells supernatants parasite cultures at
2, 4, 24 h, respectively. mirevs internalized microglia and
accumulated perinuclear region. mirevs-treated cells increased gene
expression inflammatory cytokine tnfα reduced gene expression the
immune suppressive il-10. overall, results indicate mirevs may act on
microglia, would contribute enhanced inflammation cerebral malaria.
