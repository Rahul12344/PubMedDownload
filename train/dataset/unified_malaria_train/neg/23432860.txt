plasma levels pro- anti-inflammatory cytokines plasmodium
falciparum-infected patients severe malaria (sm; n = 62) uncomplicated
malaria (um; n = 69) sri lanka assessed. sm patients significantly 
higher levels tnf-alpha (p < 0·01), il-6 (p < 0·01), il-10 (p < 0·05)
compared um patients. plasma il-2 levels patients were
undetectable. tnf-alpha levels third group patients uncomplicated p.
falciparum malaria, recruited fever episodes (umf; n = 14) 
were significantly higher um patients (p < 0·001) and
comparable sm patients. plasma ifn-gamma levels sm patients higher
compared um patients, statistically significant. body temperature 
in sm umf groups significantly higher compared um group, whereas
percentages parasitemia three groups comparable. analysis of
plasma tnf-alpha levels ratio tnf-alpha/il-10 um (n = 34) sm (n
= 34) patients carrying tnf1 tnf2 allelic types showed sm patients
carrying tnf2 significantly higher tnf-alpha levels well as
tnf-alpha/il-10 ratio compared um patients carrying tnf1, um patients carrying
tnf2 sm patients carrying tnf1 (p < 0·05). results suggest the
high circulating tnf-alpha levels inadequate il-10 response sm
patients carrying tnf2 allele could contributed development severe
falciparum malarial disease.
