background: two recent reports identified endothelial protein c receptor
(epcr) key molecule implicated severe malaria pathology. first, was
shown epcr human microvasculature mediates sequestration of
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. second, microvascular thrombosis,
one major processes causing cerebral malaria, linked reduction in
epcr expression cerebral endothelial layers. speculated genetic
variation affecting epcr functionality could influence susceptibility severe
malaria phenotypes, rendering procr, gene encoding epcr, promising
candidate association study.
methods: here, performed association study including high-resolution
variant discovery rare frequent genetic variants procr gene. the
study group, previously proven valuable tool studying the
genetics malaria, comprised 1,905 severe malaria cases aged 1-156 months and
1,866 apparently healthy children aged 2-161 months ashanti region in
ghana, west africa, malaria highly endemic. association genetic
variation severe malaria phenotypes examined basis single
variants, reconstructed haplotypes, rare variant analyses.
results: total 41 genetic variants detected regulatory coding
regions procr, 17 previously unknown genetic variants. in
association tests, none single variants, haplotypes rare variants
showed evidence association severe malaria, cerebral malaria, or
severe malaria anemia.
conclusion: present first analysis genetic variation procr 
gene context severe malaria african subjects show genetic
variation procr gene study population influence
susceptibility major severe malaria phenotypes.
