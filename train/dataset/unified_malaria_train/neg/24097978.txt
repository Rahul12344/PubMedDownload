much physiological behavioral evidence provided suggesting that
insect odorant-binding proteins (obps) indispensable odorant recognition 
and thus appealing targets structure-based discovery design novel 
host-seeking disruptors. despite fact 60 putative obp-encoding
genes identified malaria vector anopheles gambiae, crystal
structures six known. therefore clear obp
structure determination constitutes bottleneck structure-based approaches
to mosquito repellent/attractant discovery. here, describe the
three-dimensional structure a. gambiae "plus-c" group obp (agamobp48),
which exhibits second highest expression levels female antennae. this
structure represents first example three-dimensional domain-swapped
dimer dipteran species. combined binding site formed dimer
interface equal contribution monomer. structural comparisons 
monomeric agamobp47 revealed major structural difference two
plus-c proteins localizes n- c-terminal regions, concerted
conformational change may account monomer-swapped dimer conversion and
furthermore formation novel binding pockets. using combination gel
filtration chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical
ultracentrifugation, demonstrate agamobp48 dimerization solution.
eventually, molecular modeling calculations used predict binding mode
of potent synthetic ligand agamobp48 known far, discovered by
ligand- structure-based virtual screening. structure-aided identification
of multiple obp binders represents powerful tool employed effort
to control transmission vector-borne diseases.
