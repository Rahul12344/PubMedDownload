although artesunate (art) generally accepted safe well-tolerated
first-line treatment severe malaria, cases severe side effects toxicity
of compound also documented. study applied larval zebrafishes to
determine acute toxicity efficacy art performed rna-sequencing
analyses unravel underlying signaling pathways contributing art's
activities. results acute toxicity assay showed single-dose
intravenous injection art 3.6 ng/fish (1/9 maximum nonlethal
concentration) 41.8 ng/fish (lethal dose 10%) obviously induced pericardial
edema, circulation defects, yolk sac absorption delay, renal edema, swim
bladder loss, indicating acute cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, developmental 
toxicity art. efficacy assay showed art 1/2 lowest observed adverse
effect level (loael) exerted cardioprotective effects zebrafishes with
verapamil-induced heart failure. artesunate significantly restored cardiac
malformation, venous stasis, cardiac output decrease, blood flow dynamics
reduction. adverse events observed treatment, indicating that
art doses loael effective safe. results indicate art 
at low doses cardioprotective, revealed cardiotoxicity high doses.
rna-sequencing analysis showed gene expression frizzled class receptor 7a
(fzd7a) significantly upregulated zebrafishes verapamil-induced heart
failure significantly downregulated art 1/2 loael coadministrated, 
indicating fzd7a-modulated wnt signaling may mediate cardioprotective
effect art. first time, study revealed biphasic property of
art, providing in-depth knowledge pharmacological efficacy-safety profile 
for therapeutic safe applications clinic.
