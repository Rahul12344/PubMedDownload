by exposure pathogens vary relation numerous factors.
migratory behaviour may particularly important trait consider because
migratory birds exposed greater number different pathogens and
parasites breeding (i.e. temperate) overwintering (i.e. tropical 
subtropical) areas, well stopover sites migration. thus, migrants
are predicted greater mhc diversity residents. compared mhc
variation, class ii, levels haemosporidian infection between
one resident two migratory populations common yellowthroat (geothlypis
trichas). found residents less likely infected with
haemosporidian parasites lower mhc diversity class i; however,
variation mhc class ii greater residents migrants, contrary our
prediction. patterns likely caused differences in
population demography genomewide heterozygosity (based 9225 single
nucleotide polymorphisms) high three populations correlated
with mhc variation. different results mhc class ii suggest that
