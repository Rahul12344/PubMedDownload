resistance agricultural pesticides important insufficiently studied 
concern pest disease vector research. determined malathion
resistance species anopheles maculipennis mosquito group habitat
near novosibirsk, russia. 851 individuals measured members of
the anopheles messeae s.l. complex (an. messeae an. daciae species). lc50
value malathion 0.052 mg/l mixed specimens, failed find
any differences species. lc50 value within range values
for malathion resistance anopheles stephensi culex quinquefasciatus. as
the main resistance mechanism organophosphate carbamate insecticides 
single mononucleotide substitution ace-1 gene, searched this
mutation an. messeae s.l. an. beklemishevi restriction analysis. this
mutation found 347 specimens. sequenced ace-1 gene
fragment 24 specimens four species anopheles maculipennis group, 
including an. messeae, an. daciae, an. atroparvus, an. beklemishevi. these
specimens harbored nucleotide substitution triplet mutation 
lead insecticide resistance, substitution would make difficult for
the resistance develop. since studied specimens belong branches 
palearctic portion anopheles maculipennis group, suspect other
palearctic species group would difficulties harboring ace-1
mutation would lead organophosphate carbamate resistance.
