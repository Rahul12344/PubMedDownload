the genetic differentiation a. stephensi based haplotype diversity using
restriction fragment length polymorphism bysequencing co ii gene across
different localities india analyzed. presence one drai
restriction site co ii gene conferred haplotype b indicating gene 
is much conserved gene flow affected even major
geographical distance barrier. sequencing analysisof various population
parameters revealed seven haplotypes populations. west bengal
population found genetically diverse others. geographic
distance populations found contributing genetic
differentiation. sign demographic expansion found three the
five populations. local geographic barriers found ineffective in
prevention gene flow.
