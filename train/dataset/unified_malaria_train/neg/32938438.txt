background: plasmodium falciparum parasites known exhibit extensive
genetic diversity areas high transmission intensity infected
individuals communities often harbour several complex mixtures of
parasite clones different genetic characteristics. however, the
micro-environment, extent genetic diversity p. falciparum parasites
remain largely unknown. study therefore, complexity p. falciparum 
infections households investigated among symptomatic siblings, living
under roof north-central nigeria.
methods: children enrolled study least two a
household presented symptoms uncomplicated malaria. clinical malaria 
was confirmed light microscopy giemsa-stained thick thin blood films.
genomic dna isolated blood spots filter paper. molecular
characterization p. falciparum isolates done allele-specific nested pcr
of highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein-2 (msp-2) gene.
results: ninety-three children 43 households enrolled study. 
a total 26 different msp-2 alleles identified 215 fragments (range: 
180-480 bp). majority isolates [65.6% (n = 61)] polyclonal infections
consisting 2-6 clones significantly common fc27 allelic
family (p = 0.036). multiplicity infection (moi) per household ranged from
1.0 4.5 overall moi study population 2.31. pattern of
distribution msp-2 allele types among households fell two categories:
households msp-2 allele types (fc27 3d7) present; households 
where one msp-2 allele type (fc27 3d7) present. majority the
households [88.4% (n = 38)], msp-2 allele types were
disproportionately distributed among children households
[11.6% (n = 5)], children infected one type msp-2
allele.
conclusion: findings showed p. falciparum isolates exhibit remarkable 
degree genetic diversity micro-environment composed mainly of
multiclonal infections, indication high ongoing parasite
transmission. suggests micro-environment important area of
focus malaria control interventions evaluating intervention
programmes.
