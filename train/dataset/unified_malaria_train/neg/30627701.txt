crispr-based synthetic sex ratio distorters, operate shredding the
x-chromosome male meiosis, promising tools area-wide control
of harmful insect pest disease vector species. x-shredders proposed 
as tools suppress insect populations biasing sex ratio wild
population toward males, thus reducing natural reproductive potential.
however, build synthetic x-shredders based crispr, selection grna
targets, form high-copy sequence repeats x chromosome given
species, difficult, since repeats accurately resolved genome
assemblies cannot assigned chromosomes confidence. have
therefore developed redkmer computational pipeline, designed identify
short highly abundant sequence elements occurring uniquely x
chromosome. redkmer designed use input minimally processed whole genome
sequence data males females. tested redkmer short- long-read
whole genome sequence data anopheles gambiae, major vector human
malaria, x-shredding paradigm originally developed. redkmer
established long reads chromosomal proxies excellent correlation the
genome assembly used rank x-candidate kmers level of
x-specificity abundance. among these, high-confidence set 25-mers was
identified, many belonging previously known x-chromosome repeats anopheles 
gambiae, including ribosomal gene array selfish elements harbored
within it. data control strain, repeats shared the
y chromosome, confirmed elimination kmers filtering. finally,
we show redkmer output linked directly grna selection and
off-target prediction. addition, output redkmer, including the
prediction chromosomal origin single-molecule long reads chromosome
specific kmers, could also used characterization biologically
relevant sex chromosome sequences, task frequently hampered the
repetitiveness sex chromosome sequence content.
