malaria common sometimes fatal disease caused infection with
plasmodium parasites. cerebral malaria (cm) severe complication of
infection plasmodium falciparum parasites features complex
immunopathology includes prominent neuroinflammation. experimental
mouse model cerebral malaria (ecm) induced infection plasmodium
berghei anka used abundantly study role single genes, proteins
and pathways pathogenesis cm, including possible contribution to
neuroinflammation. review, discuss plasmodium berghei anka
infection model study human cm, provide summary host genetic
effects (mapped loci, single genes) whose role cm pathogenesis been
assessed model. taken together, reviewed studies document many
aspects immune system required pathological inflammation in
ecm, also identify novel avenues potential therapeutic intervention cm
and diseases feature neuroinflammation.
