background: plasmodium ovale two different subspecies: p. ovale curtisi and
p. ovale wallikeri, may distinguished gene potra encoding p.
ovale tryptophan-rich antigen. sequence size potra gene variable
between two p. ovale spp., fragment sizes found compared to
previous studies. information diversity potra genes these
two p. ovale spp. needed.
methods: total 110 dried blood samples collected clinical
patients infected p. ovale, returned africa henan province
in 2011-2016. fragments potra amplified nested pcr. sizes 
species potra gene analysed sequencing, difference 
the isolates analysed alignment amino acid sequences. the
phylogenetic tree constructed neighbour-joining determine genetic
relationship among isolates. distribution isolates was
analysed based origin country.
results: totally 67 samples infected p. o. wallikeri, included 8
genotypes potra, 43 samples infected p. o. curtisi including 3
genotypes potra. combination previous studies, p. o. wallikeri had
six sizes, 227, 245, 263, 281, 299 335 bp, p. o. curtisi four sizes, 
299, 317, 335 353 bp, fragment sizes 299 335 bp overlaps 
between two species. six amino acid one unit firstly used analyse
the amino acid sequence potra. amino acid sequence alignment revealed that
potra p. o. wallikeri differed two amino acid units, manpin aitpin,
while potra p. o. curtisi differed amino acid units tinpin titpis.
combination previous studies, ten subtypes potra exiting
for p. o. wallikeri four subtypes p. o. curtisi. phylogenetic tree
showed 11 isolates divided two clusters, p. o. wallikeri was
then divided five sub-clusters, p. o. curtisi also formed two
sub-clusters respective reference sequences. genetic relationship 
of p. ovale spp. mainly based number dominant amino acid
repeats, number manpin, aitpin, tinpin titpis. genotype the
245 bp size p. o. wallikeri 299 317 bp size p. o.
curtisi commonly exiting africa.
conclusion: study proved fragment sizes found, p. o. 
wallikeri six sizes, p. o. curtisi four sizes. ten subtypes of
potra exiting p. o. wallikeri four subtypes p. o. curtisi. the
genetic polymorphisms potra provided complementary information gene
tracing p. ovale spp. malaria elimination era.
