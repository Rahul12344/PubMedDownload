the anopheles gambiae immune response plasmodium falciparum, an
etiological agent human malaria, identified source potential 
anti-plasmodium genes mechanisms exploited efforts control the
malaria transmission cycle. one mechanism imd pathway, conserved
immune signaling pathway potent anti-p. falciparum activity. silencing
the expression caspar, negative regulator imd pathway, or
over-expressing rel2, imd pathway-controlled nfkappab transcription factor,
confers resistant phenotype a. gambiae mosquitoes involves array 
immune effector genes. however, unexplored features powerful mechanism
that may essential implementation malaria control strategy still 
remain. using rna interference singly dually silence caspar other
components imd pathway, identified genes participating the
anti-plasmodium signaling module regulated caspar, represents 
potential target achieve over-activation pathway. also determined
that imd pathway potent parasite's ookinete stage, yet
also reasonable activity early oocysts lesser activity against
late oocysts. demonstrated caspar silencing alone sufficient
to induce robust anti-p. falciparum response even relative absence of
resident gut microbiota. finally, established relevance imd pathway
components regulated effectors tep1, apl1, lrim1 parasite infection
intensity-dependent defense, thereby shedding light relevance of
laboratory versus natural infection intensity models. results highlight the
physiological considerations integral thoughtful implementation 
imd pathway manipulation a. gambiae part effort limit malaria 
transmission cycle, reveal variety previously unrecognized nuances 
in imd-directed immune response p. falciparum.
