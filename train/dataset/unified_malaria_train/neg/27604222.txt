translational stop codon readthrough emerged major regulatory mechanism
affecting hundreds genes animal genomes, based recent comparative
genomics ribosomal profiling evidence, evolutionary properties remain
unknown. here, leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 anopheles
mosquitoes systematically annotate readthrough genes malaria vector
anopheles gambiae, provide first study abundant readthrough
evolution, comparison 20 drosophila species. using improved comparative
genomics methods detecting readthrough, identify evolutionary signatures
of conserved, functional readthrough 353 stop codons malaria vector,
anopheles gambiae, 51 additional drosophila melanogaster stop codons,
including several cases double triple readthrough readthrough of
two adjacent stop codons. find differences readthrough
repertoires two species arose readthrough gain loss existing
genes, rather birth new genes gene death; readthrough-associated 
rna structures sometimes gained lost readthrough persists; that
readthrough likely lost taa tag stop codons; that
readthrough continued purifying evolutionary selection mosquito,
based population genetic evidence. also determine readthrough-associated
gene properties predate readthrough, identify differences the
characteristic properties readthrough genes clades. estimate more
than 600 functional readthrough stop codons mosquito 900 fruit fly,
provide evidence readthrough control peroxisomal targeting, refine 
phylogenetic extent abundant readthrough following divergence from
centipede.
