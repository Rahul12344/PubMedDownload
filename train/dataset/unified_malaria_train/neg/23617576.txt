background: sub-saharan africa, malaria leading cause morbidity 
mortality especially children. senegal, seasonal malaria chemoprevention
(smc) previously referred intermittent preventive treatment children
(iptc) new strategy malaria control areas high seasonal
transmission. effectiveness study smc, using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(sp) plus amodiaquine (aq), conducted central senegal 2008 2010 to
obtain information safety, feasibility delivery, cost effectiveness 
of smc. report effect smc delivery prevalence markers
of resistance sp aq.
methods: study conducted three health districts senegal 54
health posts gradual introduction smc. three administrations the
combination aq + sp made months september, october and
november year children aged less 10 years living area.
children surveyed december year samples (filter paper and
thick films) made 2008, 2009 2010. prevalence mutations the
pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1 pfcrt genes investigated sequencing rtpcr
in samples positive microscopy plasmodium falciparum.
results: mutations codon 540 pfdhps codon 164 pfdhfr not
detected study. among children parasitaemia end the
transmission seasons, cviet haplotypes pfcrt 86y polymorphism of
pfmdr1 common among received smc, number of
infections detected low confidence intervals wide. overall 
prevalence mutations lower smc areas control areas,
reflecting lower prevalence parasitaemia areas smc delivered.
conclusion: sensitivity p. falciparum smc drugs regularly
monitored areas deploying intervention. overall prevalence of
genotypes associated resistance either sp aq lower smc areas
due reduced number parasitaemia individuals.
