one decade sequencing plasmodium falciparum genome, 95% of
malaria proteins genome cannot expressed traditional cell-based
expression systems, targets best new leads antimalarial drug
discovery either known available functional form. disease
that kills 1 million people per year, routine expression recombinant
malaria proteins functional form needed discovery new
therapeutics identification targets new drugs. tested the
general utility cell-free systems expressing malaria enzymes. thirteen
test enzyme sequences reverse amplified total rna, cloned a
plant-like expression vector, subjected cell-free expression wheat
germ system. protein electrophoresis autoradiography confirmed synthesis 
of products expected molecular masses. rare problematic cases, truncated
products avoided using synthetic genes carrying wheat codons. scaled-up
production generated 39 354 Î¼g soluble protein per 10 mg translation
lysate. compared rare proteins cell-based systems produce functional 
proteins, cell-free yields comparable better. 13 test products
were enzymatically active, without failure. general path produce
functional malaria proteins allow community access new tools,
such biologically active protein arrays, lead discovery new
chemical functions, structures, inhibitors previously inaccessible malaria
gene products.
