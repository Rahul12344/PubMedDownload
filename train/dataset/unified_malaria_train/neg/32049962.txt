anopheles arabiensis opportunistic malaria vector rests feeds
outdoors, circumventing current vector control methods. furthermore, vector 
will readily feed animal well human hosts. targeting vector, while
feeding animals, provide additional intervention current vector
control activities. agricultural animals regularly vaccinated with
recombinant proteins control multiple endo- ecto-parasitic
infestations. use subolesin-vaccine showed mark reduction tick
reproductive fitness. orthologous gene subolesin, called akirin in
insects, might provide valuable species-specific intervention outdoor
biting an. arabiensis. however, biological function nuclear protein
has yet investigated mosquito. effects an. arabiensis
lifetable parameters evaluated akirin knocked using
commercial small-interfering rna (sirna) vitro transcribed double-stranded
rna (dsrna). sirna mediated interference akirin significantly reduced
fecundity 17%, fertility 23% longevity 32% compared the
controls female mosquitoes tested. similarly, dsrna treatment 25%
decrease fecundity, 29% decrease fertility, 48% decrease longevity, 
when compared control treatments. mosquitoes treated akirin dsrna had
a mean survival time 15-days post-inoculation, would impact their
ability transmit malaria parasites. results strongly suggest akirin
has pleiotropic function an. arabiensis longevity reproductive fitness.
