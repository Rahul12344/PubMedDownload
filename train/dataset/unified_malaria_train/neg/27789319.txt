the at-rich genome p. falciparum uniquely localized g-rich stretches 
have propensity form g-quadruplexes. however, global occurrence and
potential biological roles parasite poorly explored. genome-wide
analysis revealed unique enrichment quadruplexes p. falciparum genome which
was remarkably different plasmodium species. distinct predominance
of quadruplexes observed nuclear organellar genes participate 
antigenic variation, pathogenesis, dna/rna regulation, metabolic protein
quality control processes. data also suggested association quadruplexes with
snps dna methylation. furthermore, analysis steady state mrna (rna-seq)
and polysome-associated mrna (ribosome profiling) data revealed stage-specific
differences translational efficiency quadruplex harboring genes. taken
together, findings hint towards existence regulatory dynamics associated
with quadruplexes may modulate translational efficiency quadruplex
harboring genes provide survival advantage parasite host immune
response antimalarial drug pressure.
