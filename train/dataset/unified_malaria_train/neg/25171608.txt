a strategy decrease vector competence anopheles gambiae sensu stricto
(diptera: culicidae), efficient malaria vector africa, may consist of
exploiting genes involved zoophily. crossing backcrossing experiments 
were performed an. gambiae s.s. zoophilic sibling species
anopheles quadriannulatus. mosquito strains tested dual-choice
olfactometer investigate responses cow odour. totals 12% of
an. gambiae s.s. 59% an. quadriannulatus selected port cow
odour. crosses backcrosses show significant preference the
cow-baited port. results indicated anthropophilic behaviour in
an. gambiae s.s. dominant partially dominant trait, which, conjunction
with unstable zoophilic behaviour observed an. quadriannulatus, poses a
serious obstacle plans decrease vector competence modifying the
anthropophilic trait.
