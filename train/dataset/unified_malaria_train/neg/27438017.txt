recent estimates global burden fungal disease suggest their
incidence drastically underestimated mortality may rival that
of malaria tuberculosis. azoles principal class antifungal drug and
the available oral treatment fungal disease. recent occurrence and
increase azole resistance major concern worldwide. known azole resistance
mechanisms include over-expression efflux pumps mutation gene
encoding target protein cyp51a, however, one important fungal
pathogens humans, aspergillus fumigatus, much observed azole resistance
does appear involve mechanisms. present evidence azole
resistance a. fumigatus arise mutation components of
mitochondrial complex i. gene deletions 29.9kd subunit complex are
azole resistant, less virulent exhibit dysregulation secondary metabolite 
gene clusters manner analogous deletion mutants secondary

clinical azole resistant a. fumigatus isolates. evidence presented paper

change expression gene clusters involved secondary metabolism and
immunotoxin production raising potential concerns long term azole therapy.
