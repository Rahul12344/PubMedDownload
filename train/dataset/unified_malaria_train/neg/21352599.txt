background: accurate quantification plasmodium falciparum parasite numbers
by pcr important tool monitoring growth kinetics subjects infected
and subsequently treated anti-malarial agents.
methods: real-time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method using primers a
hydrolysis probe targets 18s rrna gene adapted optimized to
estimate parasite load blood samples. samples included laboratory prepared
blood samples varying parasite concentrations (6.4 × 10(5) 6.4 parasites
per 500 μl packed red blood cells (500prbc)) blood samples collected 
an experimentally infected human subject collected 19 time points 10
days. sample preparation extraction, detection chemistry, assay
reproducibility, limit detection compared previously published
sybr green rt-qpcr used malaria vaccine clinical trial.
results: rt-qpcr hydrolysis probe assay sybr green rt-qpcr provided 
a limit detection 6.4 × 10(1) parasites per 500prbc. however non-specific
amplification sybr green rt-qpcr assay led either inaccurate estimation
of parasite load levels 6.4 × 10(2) parasites per 500prbc to
false-positive detection parasites negative samples. rt-qpcr hydrolysis
probe assay specific provided reliable quantification parasitaemia
down 6.4 × 10(1) parasites per 500prbc. notably, 12 19 consecutive
samples collected experimentally infected subject 6.4 ×
10(2) copies per 500prbc.
conclusions: results show hydrolysis probe rt-qpcr assay is
superior sybr green rt-qpcr quantification p. falciparum in
human blood samples. hydrolysis probe rt-qpcr use queensland
paediatric infectious diseases laboratory (qpid) monitor parasitaemia in
experimentally-infected clinical trial subjects.
