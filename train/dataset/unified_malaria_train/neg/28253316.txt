many studies shown role agriculture selection spread of
resistance anopheles gambiae s.l. insecticides. however, study has
directly demonstrated presence insecticides breeding sources a
source selection resistance. context we
investigated presence pesticide residues breeding habitats their
formal involvement vector resistance insecticides areas west africa
with intensive farming. study carried june november 2013 
dano, southwest burkina faso areas conventional (cc) biological cotton 
(bc) growing. water sediment samples collected breeding sites located
near bc cc fields submitted chromatographic analysis research and
titrate residual insecticide content found there. larvae also collected 
in breeding sites used toxicity tests compare mortality 
those susceptible strain, anopheles gambiae kisumu. tested mosquitoes 
(living dead) analyzed pcr species identification and
characterization resistance genes. toxicity analysis water from
breeding sites showed significantly lower mortality rates breeding site water 
from biological cotton (wbc) growing sites compared conventional
cotton (wcc) sites respective an. gambiae kisumu (wbc: 80.75% vs wcc:
92.75%) wild-type strain (49.75% vs 66.5%). allele frequencies l1014f, 
l1014s kdr, g116s ace -1r mutations conferring resistance, respectively, to
pyrethroids carbamates / organophosphates 0.95, 0.4 0.12.
deltamethrin lambda-cyhalothrin identified water samples taken in
october/november mosquitoes breeding cc growing area. the
concentrations obtained respectively 0.0147ug/l 1.49 ug/l to
deltamethrin lambdacyhalothrin. results provided evidence direct
analysis (biological chromatographic tests) role agriculture a
source selection pressure vectors insecticides used growing areas.
