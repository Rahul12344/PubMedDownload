background: ddx39b (bat1) encodes rna helicase known regulate expression of
tnf il-6. elevated levels two cytokines associated with
increased severity clinical malaria. aim study investigate 
the relationship single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) ddx39b,
tnf il6 genes clinical outcomes patients plasmodium vivax
malaria.
methods: cross-sectional investigations carried two regions the
brazilian amazon several studies pathogenesis vivax malaria had
been performed. individuals categorized according infection status as
well clinical presentation following groups: uninfected, asymptomatic
infection, mild infection, complicated infection. polymorphisms were
identified using pcr restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis the
restriction enzymes nlaiii ncoi. plasma levels cytokines were
determined using elisa.
results: g allele ddx39b-22c > g associated absent decreased
manifestations malaria c allele risk factor disease
complications. study participants heterozygous tnf-308 (ga) ddx39b-348
(ct) higher tnf levels wild-type participants. haplotypes included 
ddx39b (-22c > g -348c > t) tnf polymorphisms directly
associated mild complicated malaria infections; however, haplotypes agc, 
acc, ggt, agt act associated increased tnf levels. participants
with genotype combinations gc/cc/gg/gg gg/ct/gg/gg
(ddx39b-22/ddx39b-348/tnf-308/il6-176) decreased increased risk mild
malaria, respectively, compared asymptomatic uninfected participants.
gc/cc/gg/gg linked decreased tnf il-6 levels.
conclusions: first study describe patients ddx39b il6
snps vivax malaria. findings support postulation set 
mutations immune-related genes associated inflammatory mediators and
the clinical outcomes patients malaria.
