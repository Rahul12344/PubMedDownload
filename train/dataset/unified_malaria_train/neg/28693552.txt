background: plasmodium vivax malaria remains major public health burden in
myanmar. resistance chloroquine (cq), first-line treatment p. vivax,
has reported country potential undermine local control
efforts.
methods: patients 6 years age uncomplicated p. vivax mono-infection 
were enrolled clinical efficacy studies myawaddy 2014 kawthoung in
2012. study participants received standard dose cq (25 mg/kg 3 days)
followed weekly review day 28. pvmdr1 copy number (cn) and
microsatellite diversity assessed samples patients enrolled in
the clinical study additional cross-sectional surveys undertaken myawaddy 
and shwegyin 2012.
results: total 85 patients enrolled cq clinical studies, 25 in
myawaddy 60 kawthoung. one patient myawaddy (1.2%) early
treatment failure two patients (2.3%) kawthoung presented late
treatment failures day 28. day 28 efficacy 92.0% (95% ci 71.6-97.9) in
myawaddy 98.3% (95% ci 88.7-99.8) kawthoung. day 2, 92.2% (23/25) in
myawaddy 85.0% (51/60) kawthoung aparasitaemic. genotyping pvmdr1
cn assessment undertaken 43, 52 46 clinical isolates myawaddy,
kawthoung shwegyin respectively. pvmdr1 amplification observed 3.2%
(1/31) isolates myawaddy, 0% (0/49) kawthoung 2.5% (1/40) in
shwegyin. diversity high sites (h e 0.855-0.876), low
inter-population differentiation (f st 0.016-0.026, p < 0.05).
conclusions: treatment failures chloroquine observed following
chloroquine monotherapy, pvmdr1 amplification present myawaddy and
shwegyin. results emphasize importance ongoing p. vivax drug
resistance surveillance myanmar, particularly given potential connectivity
between parasite population different sites.
