although malaria world's life-threatening parasitic disease, is
no clear understanding certain biophysical properties infected cells
change malaria infection cycle. article, use microfluidic
impedance cytometry measure dielectric properties plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells (i-rbcs) specific time points the
infection cycle. individual parasites identified within i-rbcs using green
fluorescent protein (gfp) emission. dielectric properties cell
sub-populations determined using multi-shell model. analysis showed that
the membrane capacitance cytoplasmic conductivity i-rbcs increased along
the infection time course, due membrane alterations caused parasite
infection. volume ratio occupied parasite estimated vary from
less 10% earlier stages, approximately 90% later stages. this
knowledge could used develop new label-free cell sorting techniques for
sample pre-enrichment, improving diagnosis.
