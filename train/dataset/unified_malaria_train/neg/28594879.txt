malaria major public health problem democratic republic congo.
despite progress achieved past decade fight malaria,
further efforts done surveillance containment
of plasmodium falciparum resistant strains. investigated resistance to
artemisinin-based combination therapies currently use democratic republic
of congo surveying molecular polymorphisms three genes: pfcrt, pfmdr1 and
pfk13 explore possible emergence amodiaquine, lumefantrine artemisinin
resistance democratic republic congo. study essentially revealed 
resistance chloroquine still decreasing polymorphism related to
amodiaquine resistance seems present democratic republic congo,
that three samples, located east country, harbor pfmdr1
amplification none mutations found south-east asia correlated 
with artemisinine resistance found democratic republic congo. but
new mutations identified, especially m476k, occurred same
position m476i previously identified f32-art strain, strongly
resistant artemisinine. antimalarial first-line treatments currently use in
democratic republic congo associated emergence molecular
markers resistance.
