the zoite stages malaria parasites (merozoite, ookinete sporozoite)
possess distinctive cortical structure termed pellicle, defined by
a double membrane layer named inner membrane complex (imc). imc is
supported cytoskeleton intermediate filaments, termed subpellicular
network (spn). plasmodium imc1 proteins, alveolins, make conserved family
of structurally related proteins comprise building blocks spn. here, 
using green fluorescent protein (gfp) tagging p. berghei, show the
alveolins pbimc1c pbimc1e expressed three zoite stages. data
reveal pbimc1e assembled spn concurrent pellicle
development, pbimc1c assembled pellicle formation. sexual
stages, processes accompanied different gene expressions from
maternal paternal alleles: pbimc1e expressed uniquely maternal
allele, pbimc1c expressed maternal allele gametocytes, but
from parental alleles ookinete development. findings establish 
biogenesis cortical cytoskeleton plasmodium complex dynamic

and pbimc1e genes gfp-tagged versions readily achieved using double
crossover homologous recombination, attempts disrupt genes this
strategy resulted integration selectable marker gfp
