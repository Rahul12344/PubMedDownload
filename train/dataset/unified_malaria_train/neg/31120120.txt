the fk506-binding protein plasmodium knowlesi (pk-fkbp35) considerably a
viable antimalarial drug target, belongs peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase (ppiase) protein family member. structurally, protein consists 
an n-terminal fk506-binding domain (fkbd) c-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat domain (tprd). study aims decipher functional properties 
domains platform development novel antimalarial drugs. accordingly,
full-length pk-fkbp35 well isolated domains, pk-fkbd pk-tprd were
overexpressed, purified, characterized. results showed catalytic
ppiase activity confined full-length pk-fkbp35 pk-fkbd, suggesting
that catalytic activity structurally regulated fkbd. meanwhile,
oligomerization analysis revealed pk-tprd essential dimerization.
asp55, arg60, trp77 phe117 pk-fkbd considerably important for
catalysis underlined significant reduction ppiase activity upon
mutations residues. further, inhibition activity pk-fkbp35 towards
calcineurin phosphatase activity revealed presence fkbd essential 
for inhibitory property, tprd may important efficient binding to
calcineurin. discussed possible roles fkbp35 plasmodium cells and
proposed mechanisms immunosuppressive drug, fk506, interacts with
the protein.
