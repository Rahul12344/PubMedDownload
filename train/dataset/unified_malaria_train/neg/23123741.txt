testosterone (t) known induce persistent susceptibility blood-stage
malaria plasmodium chabaudi otherwise resistant female c57bl/6 mice, 
is associated permanent changes mrna expression liver. here, we
investigate spleen major effector blood-stage malaria 
possible t-induced long-term effects lincrna mrna expression. female
c57bl/6 mice treated 3 weeks, withdrawn 12 weeks
before challenging p. chabaudi. lincrna mrna expression examined
after 12 weeks t-withdrawal subsequent infections using agilent
whole mouse genome oligo microarrays. data show first time long-term 
effects lincrna expression evidenced directly persistent changes after
t-withdrawal 12 weeks indirectly altered responsiveness expression 
to p. chabaudi infections. 3 lincrna-species upregulated 10
lincrnas downregulated 2-fold (p<0.01). addition, 11 10 mrnas
are persistently up- downregulated t, respectively. changes remain
not sustained infections peak parasitemia, 15 lincrnas 9
other mrnas exhibit altered expression. exception tnk1-mrna
encoding non-receptor tyrosine kinase 1 persistently downregulated by
0.34-fold t-withdrawal becomes upregulated 5.9-fold upon
infection peak parasitemia, suggesting involvement tyrosine
phosphorylation tnk1 mediating long-term effects spleen. the
t-induced changes splenic mrna expression totally different those
previously observed liver. collectively, data support view 
induces long-term organ-specific changes lincrna mrna expression,
that presumably contribute organ-specific dysfunctions upon infection with
blood-stage malaria p. chabaudi.
