background: novel transgenic mosquito control methods require progressively 
realistic evaluation. goal study determine effect a
transgene causes male-bias sex ratio anopheles gambiae target
populations large insectary cages.
methods: life history characteristics anopheles gambiae wild type ag(pmb)1
(aka gfp124l-2) transgenic mosquitoes, whose progeny 95% male, measured 
in order parameterize predictive population models. ag(pmb)1 males then
introduced two ratios large insectary cages containing target wild type
populations stable age distributions densities. predicted proportion
of females observed large cages compared. related model
was used predict effects male releases wild mosquitoes west
african village.
results: frequency transgenic mosquitoes target populations reached 
average 0.44 ± 0.02 0.56 ± 0.02 6 weeks 1:1 3:1
release ratio treatments (transgenic male:wild male) respectively. transgenic
males caused sex-ratio distortion 73% 80% males 1:1 3:1
treatments, respectively. number eggs laid transgenic treatments
declined experiment progressed, steeper decline 3:1 
the 1:1 releases. results experiment partially consistent with
predictions model; effect size variability conform the
model two three trials, effect size over-estimated model and
variability greater anticipated, possibly sampling effects in
restocking. model estimating effects hypothetical releases the
mosquito population west african village demonstrated releases could
significantly reduce number females wild population. interval
of releases expected strong effect.
conclusions: biological data produced parameterize model, model
itself, results experiments components system evaluate
and predict performance transgenic mosquitoes. together suggest that
the ag(pmb)1 strain potential useful reversible population
suppression novel field develops.
