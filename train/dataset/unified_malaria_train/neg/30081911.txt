background: malaria leading cause global paediatric mortality in
children 5 years age. number fatalities reduced significantly
due expansion control interventions development new
technologies remains necessary order achieve elimination. recent attention 
has focused release genetically modified (gm) mosquitoes into
natural vector populations mechanism interrupting parasite transmission
but despite successful vivo laboratory studies, detailed population genetic 
assessment, must first precede proposed field trial, yet be
undertaken systematically. here, genetic structure anopheles gambiae
populations north-western lake victoria explored assess their
suitability candidates pilot field study release gm mosquitoes.
methods: 478 anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected six locations a
subset (n = 96) selected restriction site-associated dna sequencing
(radseq). resulting single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) marker set was
analysed effective size (ne), connectivity population structure (pca,
fst).
results: 5175 high-quality genome-wide snps identified. principal
components analysis (pca) collinear genomic regions illustrated that
individuals clustered concordance geographic origin overlap
between sites. genetic differentiation populations varied with
inter-island comparisons highest values (median fst 0.0480-0.0846). ne
estimates generally small (124.2-1920.3).
conclusions: reduced-representation snp marker set genome-wide an. gambiae 
genetic analysis north-western lake victoria basin reported. island
populations demonstrated low moderate genetic differentiation greater
structure suggesting limitation migration. smaller estimates ne
indicate introduced effector transgene susceptible to
genetic drift ensure driven fixation robust gene drive
mechanism likely needed. findings, together favourable
location suitability frequent monitoring, indicate ssese islands
contain several candidate field locations, merit evaluation as
potential gm mosquito pilot release sites.
