artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) used treat uncomplicated 
plasmodium falciparum infections india since 2004. since 2008, decrease in
artemisinin effectiveness seen throughout greater mekong subregion. 
the geographic proximity ecological similarities northeastern india to
southeast asia may differentially affect long-term management and
sustainability act india. order collect baseline data variations
in act sensitivity indian parasites, 12 p. falciparum isolates northeast 
india 10 isolates southwest india studied vitro ring-stage
survival assay (rsa) showed reduced sensitivity dihydroartemisinin 50% of
the samples collected northeast india 2014 2015. two 10 assayed 
samples southwest region india far back 2012 also showed
decreased sensitivity artemisinin. regions, kelch gene sequences
were predictive reduced artemisinin sensitivity, measured rsa. the
present data justify future investments integrated approaches involving
clinical follow-up studies, vitro survival assays, molecular markers for
tracking potential changes effectiveness artemisinin p.
falciparum throughout india.
