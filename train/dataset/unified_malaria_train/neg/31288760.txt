background: oxidative stress plays vital role pathogenesis both
sickle cell disease (scd) plasmodium falciparum malaria. however, are
limited studies effect p. falciparum malaria infection oxidative
stress scd patients.
methods: cross-sectional study undertaken compare levels biomarkers
of oxidative stress isolates scd patients uncomplicated p.falciparum
malaria. biomarkers namely: malondialdehyde (mda), reduced glutathione (gsh),
catalase (cat) glutathione peroxidase (gpx) determined plasma samples
from scd malaria positive, malaria positive, scd malaria negative healthy
control participants. genetic diversity p.falciparum determined by
nested polymerase chain reaction merozoite surface protein-2 (msp-2) gene.
results: 207 participants, 54 (26%) scd malaria positive, 51 (24%)
malaria positive, 51 (24%) scd controls 51 (24%) healthy control individuals.
the mean concentration mda significantly higher scd malaria positive
than scd controls (p < 0.0001). contrast, mean concentration gsh
(p < 0.0001) gpx (p < 0.0001) significantly lower scd malaria than
scd controls. although significantly different, mean concentration mda
was higher (p = 0.0478), geometric mean parasite density (p = 0.2430) and
multiplicity infection (p = 0.3478) lower scd malaria samples 
malaria samples. prevalent msp2 allelic family ic3d7 scd malaria 
(72%) malaria (76%) samples. biomarkers oxidative stress not
significantly different ic3d7 fc27 allelic families msp2.
conclusion: identified severe oxidative stress sickle cell disease patients
with uncomplicated p.falciparum malaria.
