background: rna degradation critical survival cells. with
increasing evidence pervasive transcription cells, rna degradation has
gained recognition means regulating gene expression. yet, rna degradation
machinery studied extensively eukaryotic organisms,
including saccharomyces cerevisiae humans. giardia lamblia parasitic
protist unusual genomic traits: binucleated tetraploid, very
compact genome, displays theme genomic minimalism cellular machinery
commonly comprised reduced number protein components, a
remarkably large population long, stable, noncoding, antisense rnas.
results: use silico approaches investigate major rna
degradation machinery giardia lamblia compare broad array other
parasitic protists. found key constituents deadenylation and
decapping machinery 5'-3' rna degradation pathway. similarly
found major 3'-5' rna degradation pathways present in
giardia, including exosome-dependent exosome-independent machinery.
however, observe significant loss rna degradation machinery genes will
result important differences protein composition, potentially
functionality, various rna degradation pathways. apparent 
the exosome, central mediator 3'-5' degradation, apparently contains
an altered core configuration giardia plasmodium, four,
instead canonical six, distinct subunits. additionally exosome in
giardia missing rrp6, nab3, nrd1 proteins, known key
regulators noncoding transcript stability cells.
conclusions: findings suggest although full complement the
major rna degradation mechanisms present - likely functional - early 
eukaryotic evolution, composition function complexes more
variable previously appreciated. suggest missing components of
the exosome complex provide explanation stable abundance sterile
rna species giardia.
