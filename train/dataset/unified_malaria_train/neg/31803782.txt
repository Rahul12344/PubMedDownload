background: overcome human malaria problem several solutions been
employed including extensive studies field plasmodia relevant antigens.
the aim study determine allelic variation msp1 gene of
plasmodium falciparum among falciparum malaria-infected patients in
southeastern iran.
methods: twenty p. falciparum positive cases enrolled sistan and
baluchistan province, southeastern iran 2013-15. case, 1.5ml of
peripheral blood collected edta contained tubes. thick thin blood
smears stained standard giemsa stain checked conventional
microscopical method. dna extracted blood samples amplification of
block 2 msp1 performed using specific primers. gel electrophoresis done
and results showed amplification fragments corresponding block 2 regions 
of pf msp1 gene. finally, four samples different allelic types sent for
sequencing process.
results: fragments different size, classified six allelic types
as kinds 1-6 based happening frequencies. digestion pcr products
revealed two sub allelic types (a b) within allelic types 2 3, in
allelic types 1, 4, 5 6. twenty percent samples sent sequencing. 
sequence alignment showed 78.95% 91.83% identity samples.
conclusion: identity samples phylogenetic tree revealed is
an extensive diversity range among isolates. fifty percent isolates were
under risk complicated malaria. two patients (10%) needed special
care recovery obtained getting hospital services.
