background: anopheles lesteri anopheles sinensis two major malaria
vectors china southeast asia. dramatically different terms 
geographical distribution, host preference, resting habitats, traits
associated ecological adaptation malaria transmission. species
belong anopheles hyrcanus group, extent genetic differences
between well understood. provide effective way differentiate
between species find useful markers population genetics studies, we
performed comparative cytogenetic analysis two malaria vectors.
results: presented standard cytogenetic map an. lesteri, a
comparative analysis chromosome structure gene order an. lesteri
and an. sinensis. results demonstrate much gene order on
chromosomes x 2 reshuffled two species. however, banding 
pattern gene order chromosome 3 appeared conserved. also
found two new polymorphic inversions, 2lc 3rb, an. lesteri, mapped 
the breakpoints two inversions polytene chromosomes.
conclusions: results demonstrate extent structural divergence of
chromosomes an. lesteri an. sinensis, provide new taxonomic
cytogenetic tool distinguish two species. polymorphic inversions
of an. lesteri could serve markers studies population structure and
ecological adaptations major malaria vector.
