background: merozoite surface protein-3β plasmodium vivax (pvmsp-3β) is
one candidate antigens blood stage malaria vaccine development. the
polymorphisms pvmsp-3β reported certain p. vivax isolates.
however, diversity pvmsp-3β throughout global distribution not
been well understood. study, genetic diversity effects of
natural selection pvmsp-3β among p. vivax korean isolates analysed.
methods: blood samples collected 95 patients vivax malaria in
korea. region flanking full-length pvmsp-3β amplified polymerase chain
reaction cloned ta cloning vector. pvmsp-3β sequence each
isolate determined polymorphic characteristics effects natural
selection analysed using dnastar, mega4, dnasp programs.
results: five different subtypes pvmsp-3β identified based single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), insertions, deletions. although high level
of sequence diversity observed pvmsp-3β gene, coiled-coil tertiary
structure pvmsp-3β protein well conserved sequences. the
pvmsp-3β korean isolates natural selection. dna polymerase slippage
and intragenic recombination likely contributed pvmsp-3β diversity korean
p. vivax isolates.
conclusions: pvmsp-3β korean p. vivax isolates displayed polymorphisms,
with snps, insertions deletions scattered throughout gene. these
results parasite heterogeneity relevant development pvmsp-3β
based vaccine p. vivax implementation malaria control
programmes korea.
