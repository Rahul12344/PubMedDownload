invasion human erythrocytes essential plasmodium falciparum parasite
survival pathogenesis, also complex phenotype. later
steps invasion appear invariant essential, earlier steps of
recognition controlled series redundant, partially
understood, receptor-ligand interactions. reverse genetic analysis laboratory 
adapted strains identified multiple genes deleted alter
invasion, relative contributions gene translate the
phenotypes clinical isolates far clear. used forward genetic
approach identify genes responsible variable erythrocyte invasion by
phenotyping parents progeny previously generated experimental genetic 
crosses. linkage analysis using whole genome sequencing data revealed single
major locus responsible majority phenotypic variation two
invasion pathways. locus contained pfrh2a pfrh2b genes, members of
one major invasion ligand gene families, widely thought play
such prominent role specifying invasion phenotypes. variation invasion
pathways linked significant differences pfrh2a pfrh2b expression
between parasite lines, role specifying alternative invasion was
confirmed crispr-cas9-mediated genome editing. expansion analysis 
large set clinical p. falciparum isolates revealed common deletions,
suggesting variation locus major cause invasion phenotypic
variation endemic setting. work implications blood-stage
vaccine development help inform design location future
large-scale studies invasion clinical isolates.
