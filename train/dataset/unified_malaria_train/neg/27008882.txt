a major challenge global malaria control elimination early detection
and containment emerging drug resistance. next-generation sequencing (ngs)
methods provide resolution, scalability, sensitivity required for
high-throughput surveillance molecular markers drug resistance. have
developed amplicon sequencing method ion torrent pgm platform for
targeted resequencing panel six plasmodium falciparum genes implicated in
resistance first-line antimalarial therapy, including artemisinin combination 
therapy, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. protocol optimized
using 12 geographically diverse p. falciparum reference strains successfully 
applied multiplexed sequencing 16 clinical isolates india. the
sequencing results reference strains showed 100% concordance with
previously reported drug resistance-associated mutations. single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) clinical isolates revealed number known
resistance-associated mutations nonsynonymous mutations not
been implicated drug resistance. snp positions containing multiple allelic
variants used identify three clinical samples containing mixed genotypes 
indicative multiclonal infections. amplicon sequencing protocol been
designed benchtop ion torrent pgm platform operated with
minimal bioinformatics infrastructure, making ideal use countries 
are endemic disease facilitate routine large-scale surveillance the
emergence drug resistance ensure continued success malaria
treatment policy.
