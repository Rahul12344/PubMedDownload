inversion polymorphisms responsible many ecologically important
phenotypes often found balancing selection. however, same
features ensure large role local adaptation-especially reduced
recombination alternate arrangements-mean uncovering precise
loci within inversions control phenotypes unachievable using
standard mapping approaches. here, take advantage long-term balancing
selection pair inversions mosquito anopheles gambiae map
desiccation tolerance via pool-gwas. two polymorphic inversions chromosome 2
of species (denoted 2la 2rb) associated arid hot conditions
in africa maintained spatially temporally heterogeneous
environments. measuring thousands wild-caught individuals survival
under desiccation stress, used phenotypically extreme individuals homozygous
for alternative arrangements 2la inversion construct pools for
whole-genome sequencing. genomewide association mapping using pools
revealed dozens significant snps within 2la 2rb, many which
neighboured genes controlling ion channels related functions. results
point promise similar approaches systems inversions maintained 
by balancing selection provide list candidate genes underlying the
specific phenotypes controlled two inversions studied here.
