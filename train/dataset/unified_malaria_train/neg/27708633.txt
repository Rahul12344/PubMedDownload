the bacteria midgut anopheles stephensi adult females laboratory
colonies studied sequencing v4 region 16s rrna genes, respect
to three experimental factors: stable cured wolbachia infection; sugar or
blood diet; age. proteobacteria bacteroidetes dominated community
[>90% operational taxonomic units (otus)]; taxa classes
flavobacteriia, gammaproteobacteria, alphaproteobacteria, assigned
to elizabethkingia (46.9%), asaia (6.4%) pseudomonas (6.0%), unclassified 
enterobacteriaceae (37.2%). bacterial communities similar between
wolbachia-cured wolbachia-infected mosquito lines, indicating gut
microbiota dysregulated presence wolbachia. proportion 
enterobacteriaceae higher mosquitoes fed blood meal compared those
provided sugar meal. collectively, bacterial community similar
structure older wolbachia-infected mosquitoes 8 days blood meal, 
in younger wolbachia-infected mosquitoes blood meal, except older
mosquitoes higher proportion enterobacteriaceae lower proportion 
elizabethkingia. consistent presence certain predominant bacteria
(elizabethkingia, asaia, pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae) suggests would
be useful paratransgenesis control malaria infection, particularly when
coupled wolbachia-based intervention strategy.
