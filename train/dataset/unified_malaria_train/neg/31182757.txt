confers high levels protection controlled human malaria infection
(chmi) model. provide broad, unbiased assessment composition and
kinetics direct ex vivo human immune responses cps, profiled whole-blood
transcriptomes rna-seq cps immunization following chmi
challenge. differential expression genes enriched modules related t
