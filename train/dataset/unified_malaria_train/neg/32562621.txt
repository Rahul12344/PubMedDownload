malaria still important challenge global public health its
extensive mortality morbidity. plasmodium ovale mainly distributed in
tropical regions africa asia. includes two distinct ovale malaria
species, p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri. apical membrane
antigen-1 (ama-1) asexual blood-stage protein essential for
plasmodium. thus far, study gene polymorphism immunogenicity p.
ovale ama-1 (poama-1) conducted. amplified poama1 gene products 14 
p ovale curtisi samples 12 p ovale wallikeri samples imported africa 
jiangsu province, china sequenced polymorphisms analyzed. 
expressed recombinant poama-1 (rpoama-1, 53 kda) proteins e. coli
expression system evaluated immune responses rpoama-1 balb/c
mice. identified synonymous mutation nucleotide position 333 the
pocama-1 gene powama-1 reveal variation. humoral cellular
immune responses rpoama-1 evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) flow cytometry. rpoama-1-immunized mice produced specific
antibodies verified immunoblotting. rpoama-1 induced high antibody
titers (1: 640,000), high avidity indexes (an average 78.63% and
83.40%). antibodies also recognized native proteins, namely, crude
antigen blood stages. cross-reactivity rpocama-1 rpowama-1 was
observed. moreover, rpoama-1 s induced interferon (ifn)-gamma-secreting cells 
mice increased lymphocyte proliferation response. low genetic diversity was
observed poama-1 jiangsu province imported malaria cases, further
studies conclusively showed strong immunogenicity. significant
cross-reactivity found rpocama-1 rpowama-1, suggesting a
single poama-1 antigen could used diagnose p. ovale curtisi p. ovale
wallikeri patient simultaneously. however, evaluation needs carried
out validate potential limitations poama-1 candidate vaccine.
