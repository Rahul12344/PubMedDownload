plasmodium vivax become predominant malaria parasite major
challenge malaria elimination greater mekong subregion (gms). yet, our
knowledge evolution p. vivax populations gms fragmental.
we performed whole genome sequencing 23 p. vivax samples the
china-myanmar border (cmb) used 21 high-coverage samples compare over
200 samples rest gms. using genome-wide single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps), analyzed population differentiation, genetic structure, 
migration potential selection using array methods. cmb parasites
displayed higher proportion monoclonal infections, 52% shared 90%
of genomes identity-by-descent segments least one sample
from cmb, suggesting preferential expansion certain parasite strains in
this region, likely resulting p. vivax outbreaks occurring this
study period. principal component, admixture, fixation index phylogenetic
analyses identified parasites cmb genetically distinct
from parasites eastern parts gms (cambodia, laos, vietnam, and
thailand), whereas eastern gms parasite populations largely
undifferentiated. genetic differentiation pattern p. vivax
populations gms parasite largely explainable geographic
distance. using genome-wide snps, narrowed set 36 snps for
differentiating parasites different areas gms. genome-wide scans to
determine selection genome two statistical methods identified genes
potentially drug selection, including genes associated antifolate
resistance genes linked chloroquine resistance plasmodium falciparum.
