the recent reports high failure rates decline vitro sensitivity of
plasmodium falciparum artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) suggest
the possibility clinical artemisinin resistance along thai-cambodian and
thai-myanmar borders. study investigated cellular mechanisms action and
resistance p. falciparum artesunate (stage specific activity, interaction
with hemozoin, anti-oxidant levels) two paired p. falciparum isolates 
(msf046 msf060) collected treatment 3-day artesunate-mefloquine
and time recrudescence. addition, link cellular
mechanisms polymorphisms candidate artemisinin-resistant genes
(pfatp6, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp1, k13 propeller) also investigated.
morphological change observed pairs primary recrudesced p.
falciparum isolates 12-48Â h exposure artesunate (at ic90). marked 
decrease parasite viability found recrudesced isolates both
msf046 msd060. extent reduction (% change baseline) total
glutathione concentrations significantly lower recrudesced (32.1 1.7%)
compared primary (45.5 53.7%) isolates msf046 msf060. the
extent reduction hemozoin content msf046 significantly higher the
recrudesced (76.8%) isolate compared primary isolate (99.5%). msf060
on hand, increase hemozoin content found recrudesced
isolate extent increase significantly higher recrudesced
(93.1%) primary isolate (87.5%). polymorphism k13 (n458y) together
with pfmdr1 copy number correlated well sensitivity isolates to
artesunate. results preliminary study suggests possible role of
glutathione-dependent detoxification system well heme degradation as
cellular mechanisms action resistance artemisinins.
