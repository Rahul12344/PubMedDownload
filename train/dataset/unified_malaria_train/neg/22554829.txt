plasmodium vivax malaria remains one tropical diseases causing enormous
burden global public health. several proteins located parasite
species' merozoite surface considered suitable antigens for
being included anti-malarial vaccine, given functional role play
during parasite's interaction red blood cells. present study
identifies characterizes p. vivax pv12 surface protein was
evaluated using molecular biology immunochemistry assays; antigenic
potential also examined natural experimental p. vivax malaria
infections. p. vivax vcg-1 strain pv12 gene encodes 362 amino acid-long
protein exhibiting signal peptide, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor 
sequence two 6-cys domains. presence pv12 protein the
parasite's surface association detergent-resistant membrane
complexes, together antigenic potential, supports notion this
antigen could play important role red blood cell binding ligand. 
studies aimed establishing immunogenicity protection-inducing ability 
of pv12 protein products aotus experimental model thus
suggested.
