background: increased susceptibility plasmodium falciparum infection during
pregnancy attributed accumulation infected erythrocytes the
placenta. phenomenon mediated var gene coding var2csa, which
adheres chondroitin sulphate a. however, contribution parasites
transcribing var genes maternal infections well
characterized.
methods: transcription var2csa var groups a, b, c measured by
real-time polymerase chain reaction 30 placental 21 peripheral p.
falciparum isolates pregnant women 42 isolates nonpregnant
adults children. associations infections non-var2csa isolates with
maternal parasitemia immune responses assessed.
results: placental parasites showed highest levels var2csa. abc var genes 
were transcribed 20 (67%) 30 placental isolates associated with
higher parasitemia compared infections parasites transcribing
var2csa (p = .004). peripheral isolates pregnant women transcribed abc var
genes levels similar parasites infecting nonpregnant adults with
clinical malaria (p[vara] = .420, p[varb] = .808, p[varc] = .619).
conclusions: transcripts var2csa abundant pregnancy-associated p.
falciparum infections; however, abc var types also common, especially in
peripheral blood, transcription levels similar infections of
pregnancy. findings interest design malaria vaccines 
pregnant women.
