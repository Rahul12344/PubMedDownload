apicomplexans group microbial eukaryotes contain most
well-studied parasites, including causing agents toxoplasmosis and
malaria, emergent diseases like cryptosporidiosis babesiosis. decades of
research illuminated pathogenic mechanisms, molecular biology, and
genomics model apicomplexans, know little diversity and
distribution natural environments. study analyze distribution
of apicomplexans across range host-associated free-living
environments. using publicly available small subunit (ssu) rrna gene databases,
high-throughput environmental sequencing (htes) surveys, generated
htes data, developed apicomplexan reference database, includes the
largest apicomplexan ssu rrna tree available date encompasses
comprehensive sampling group closest relatives. tree
allowed us identify correct incongruences molecular identification 
of apicomplexan sequences. analyzing diversity distribution of
apicomplexans htes studies curated reference database also showed 
widespread, quantitatively important, presence apicomplexans across a
variety free-living environments. data allow us describe remarkable
molecular diversity group compared current knowledge, especially
when compared identified described apicomplexan species. is
most striking marine environments, potentially diverse
apicomplexans apparently exist, yet formally recognized. the
new database useful microbial ecology epidemiological studies,
and provide valuable reference medical veterinary diagnosis especially in
cases emerging, zoonotic, cryptic infections.
