objective: candida albicans yeast multiple genotypes. commensal 
fungus colonizing various sites. however, host's immune system weakens, 
it becomes pathogenic responsible various lesions. burkina faso,
antifungal drugs frequently used, particularly fluconazole, used
systemic antifungal. antifungal drug antifungal drugs often
used self-medication prescribed outside antifungal susceptibility test 
results. situations led emergence candida albicans strains
resistant antifungal drugs commonly used burkina faso. aim this
study determine types candida albicans using pcrs targeting 25s
rdna alt repeat sequences rps establish azoles and
polyenes susceptibility profile.
material methods: antifungal susceptibility testing disk diffusion method 
was performed accordance clsi document m44-a yeasts the
manufacturer's instructions. candida albicans isolates genotyped using
specific pcr primers rdna rps genes.
results: ten (10) rps types candida albicans found study: most
common rps types a3 (40.6%), a2 (24.0%) a2/3 (14.6%) genotype a, b2/3
(5.2%) genotype b c2 (3.2%) genotype c. azole resistance,
especially fluconazole (74.4%), common genotype a, including a3
(36.6%), a2 (18. 3%). polyene resistance rare nystatin, a3 (1.2%)
resistant isolate nystatin observed. amphotericin b, highest
observed resistance rates a3 (11.0%) a2/3 (8.5%) genotype 
b2 (10.0%), b3 (10.0%) b2/3 (10.0%) genotype b.
conclusion: study showed candida albicans resistance azoles,
especially fluconazole, important phenomenon ouagadougou, several
genotypes rps types involved. thus, fluconazole would antifungal
agent first-line prescribing treatment candidiasis ouagadougou.
this study continued determine molecular mechanisms involved in
these antifungal resistances, research new molecules with
different action targets.
