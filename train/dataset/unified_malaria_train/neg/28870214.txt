background: polyclonal blood-stage infections plasmodium vivax frequent
even low transmission settings, allowing meiotic recombination between
heterologous parasites. empirical data meiotic products however lacking.
this study examined microsatellites oocysts derived membrane feeding of
mosquitoes blood-stage p. vivax infections thai-myanmar border.
methods: blood samples patients presenting vivax malaria fed to
anopheles cracens membrane feeding individual oocysts midguts were
obtained dissection 7 days. dna extracted oocysts parental 
blood samples tested microsatellite analysis.
results: focused study eight microsatellite markers undertaken nine 
blood stage infections 2013, derived oocysts studied six
cases. one alleles successfully amplified 131 oocysts, revealing
high levels allelic diversity blood oocyst stages. based on
standard criteria defining minor alleles, evidence clear
deviation random mating (inbreeding) relatively heterozygous
oocysts compared variance across entire oocyst population (fit = 0.89).
the main explanation appeared natural compartmentalisation mosquito
(fsc = 0.27) human stages (fct = 0.68). one single human case produced a
total 431 successfully amplified loci (across 70 oocysts) homozygous
and identical parental alleles markers, indicating clonal infection and
transmission. heterozygous oocyst alleles found 15/176 (8.5%)
successfully amplified loci five cases. apparently reduced
oocyst heterozygosity individual oocysts compared diversity within
individual mosquitoes (fis = 0.55), may simply reflect difficulty of
detecting minor alleles oocysts, given high rate amplification failure.
inclusion minor allele peaks (irrespective height) matching peaks were
found related blood oocyst samples, added 11 minor alleles 9 oocysts,
increasing number heterozygous loci 26/176 (14.8%; p = 0.096).
conclusion: apparently low level heterozygous oocysts this
can explained combination factors: relatively low complexity of
parental infection, natural compartmentalisation humans mosquitoes, and
the methodological challenge detecting minor alleles.
