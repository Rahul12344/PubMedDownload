artemisinin first choice malaria treatment. plastidial mep pathway
provides 5-carbon precursors (ipp isomer dmapp) biosynthesis of
isoprenoid (including artemisinin). hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(e)-butenyl 4-diphosphate 
reductase (hdr) last enzyme involved mep pathway, catalyzes
hmbpp form ipp dmapp. study, isolated full-length cdna of
hdr artemisia annua l. (aahdr2) performed functional analysis. according
to gene expression analysis aahdr2 (genbank: kx058541) aahdr1 reported
ever (genbank: adc84348.1) qpcr, found aahdr1 aahdr2 much
higher expression level trichomes roots, stems, leaves and
flowers. aahdr2 much higher expression level flowers leaves. 
further, plant hormones ja aba respectively up-regulated the
expression level aahdr1 aahdr2 significantly, ga3 up-regulated the
expression level aahdr2 only. gene expression analysis aahdr1 and
aahdr2 showed aahdr2 greater contribution aahdr1 isoprenoid
biosynthesis(including artemisinin). used aahdr2 following
experiments. bioinformatic analysis indicated aahdr2 belonged hdr
family functional complementation assay showed aahdr2 the
enzymatic function hdr, using e. coli mutant mg1655(ara)<>hdr host cell.
the subcellular localization assay showed aahdr2 fused gfp its
n-terminal specifically targeted chloroplasts. finally, aahdr2 was
overexpressed arabidopsis thaliana. aahdr2-overexpressing plants produced 
the isoprenoids including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b carotenoids at
significantly higher levels wild-type arabidopsis plants. summary,
aahdr2 might candidate gene genetic improvement isoprenoid
biosynthesis.
