background: c-reactive protein (crp) levels reported elevated in
populations african descent living affluent environments compared to
populations european ancestry. however, natural history crp levels in
populations african descent living adverse environments remains largely 
unknown.
methods: crp levels measured high sensitivity assay 624 apparently
healthy individuals contributed blood part study innate immune
responsiveness traditional ghanaian population living adverse
environmental conditions malaria endemic area. comparison, included 
crp measurements 2931 apparently healthy individuals dutch
population included batch crp analyses. associations
between crp body mass index (bmi), immune responsiveness, p. falciparum
parasitaemia investigated.
results: age- sex-adjusted model, crp levels 0.54 mg/l lower in
the ghanaian compared dutch cohort (1.52 vs. 0.98 mg/l, p<0.001). when
accounting substantially higher average bmi dutch compared 
ghanaians (25.6 vs. 18.4 kg/m(2)) difference crp levels disappeared. bmi
associated positively crp dutch ghanaians. in
individuals acute phase response, crp levels higher ghanaian 
compared dutch cohort (24.6 vs. 17.3 mg/l, p = 0.04). levels crp were
positively related immune responsiveness p. falciparum parasitaemia (all
p<0.001) among ghanaians.
conclusions: study demonstrates west-africans exhibit an
inherently high inflammatory state. role genes, environment and
gene-environment interaction explaining reports elevated crp levels in
populations african ancestry compared ethnicities living in
affluent environments thus merits investigation.
