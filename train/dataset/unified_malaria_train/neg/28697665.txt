malaria significant threat throughout developing world. among most
fascinating aspects protozoan parasites responsible disease are
the methods employ avoid immune system perpetuate chronic
infections. key among antigenic variation: systematically altering
antigens displayed host's immune system, parasite renders the
adaptive immune response ineffective. plasmodium falciparum, species
responsible severe form human malaria, process involves a
complicated molecular mechanism results continuously changing patterns of
variant-antigen-encoding gene expression. although many features process 
remain obscure, significant progress made recent years decipher
various molecular aspects regulatory cascade causes chronic
infection.
