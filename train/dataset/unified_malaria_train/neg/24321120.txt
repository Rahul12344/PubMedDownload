background: sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (sdx/pyr) combination chosen 
to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria malaysia 30 years.
non-silent mutations dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes responsible resistance pyrimethamine and
sulphadoxine, respectively. study reports mutational analysis pfdhfr 
and pfdhps single plasmodium falciparum infection isolates interior
division sabah, malaysian borneo.
methods: total 22 p. falciparum single infection isolates collected two
districts interior division sabah february november 2010 were
recruited mutational study pfdhfr pfdhps. genes were
amplified nested pcr prior dna sequencing mutational analysis.
results: total three pfdhfr four pfdhps alleles identified. the
most prevalent pfdhfr allele anrnl (86%) involving triple mutation position
108(s n), 59(c r) 164(i l). pfdhps, two novel alleles, sgtga
(73%) aakaa (5%) identified. alleles involving triple mutation both
pfdhfr (anrnl) pfdhps (sgtga), absent sabah study
conducted 15 years ago, prevalent.
conclusions: high prevalence mutations sdx/pyr associated drug resistance
genes reported study. mutational study pfdhps pfdhfr
indicating sdx/pyr discontinued region.
