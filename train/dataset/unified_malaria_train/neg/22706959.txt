the goal present study assess evolution vitro
chloroquine resistance also prevalence pfcrt t76 pfmdr1 y86
mutations pikine 2000 chloroquine (cq) first-line treatment
of malaria 2009 artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) in
use. genotyped pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y polymorphisms pcr-rflp and
assessed vitro cq susceptibility double-site enzyme-linked pldh
immunodetection (deli) assay plasmodium falciparum isolates collected in
pikine, senegal. proportions pfcrt t76 allele light the
three different treatment policies 72.4 % cq withdrawal (2000 to
2003), 47.2% amodiaquine plus fansidar first-line treatment (2004
to 2005), 59.5 % since act use implemented (2006 2009). the
prevalence pfcrt t76 decreased significantly cq stopped [x (2) =
6.54, p = 0.01 (2000-2003 versus 2004-2005)] slightly since acts have
been implemented [x(2) = 1.12, p = 0.28 (2000-2003 versus 2006-2009)]. were
no significant differences prevalence pfmdr1 y86 throughout three
treatment policies. deli assay carried episodically 2000 (n = 36),
2001 (n = 47), 2009 (n = 37). mean ic(50)s isolates cq 2000 
versus 2009 2001 versus 2009 significantly different (p < 0.05). the
fisher exact test found significant association presence the
pfcrt t76 mutant allele vitro resistance 2000/2001 (p = 0.023), while
in 2009 association variables (p = 0.274). mutant
pfcrt t76 pfmdr1 y86 alleles vitro cq-resistant strains still
circulating pikine. official discontinuation cq use completely
followed total withdrawal private drug sellers, molecule
still exerts pressure local p. falciparum populations.
