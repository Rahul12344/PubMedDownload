malaria vectors exposed intense selective pressures due large-scale
intervention programs underway african countries. one the
current priorities therefore clearly assess adaptive potential of
anopheline populations, critical understand anticipate the
response mosquitoes elicit adaptive challenges. development 
of genomic resources empower robust examinations evolutionary
changes vectors including currently understudied species inevitable 
step toward goal. constructed double-digest restriction associated
dna (ddrad) libraries generated 6461 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
that used explore population structure demographic history of
wild-caught anopheles moucheti cameroon. genome-wide distribution of
allelic frequencies among samples best fitted old population at
equilibrium, characterized weak genetic structure extensive genetic
diversity, presumably due large long term effective population size.
estimates fst linkage disequilibrium (ld) across snps reveal low
genetic differentiation throughout genome absence segregating ld
blocks among populations, suggesting overall lack local adaptation. our
study provides first investigation genetic structure diversity 
an. moucheti genomic scale. conclude that, despite weak genetic
structure, species potential challenge current vector control
measures rapid anthropogenic environmental changes thanks its
great genetic diversity.
