background: india, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) use partner 
drug act (as+sp) treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 2010.
declined trend as+sp efficacy reported north-eastern states of
the country. possible determine efficacy sp alone any
study act. so, work designed study pattern polymorphisms 
in pfdhfr pfdhps genes predict sp resistance status among parasite
population urban kolkata five years act implementation.
methods: total 125 p. falciparum positive patients enrolled the
study december 2014 july 2016 treated as+sp. parasitic dna was
isolated subjected sequencing pfdhfr pfdhps genes directly from
purified pcr products.
results: genotyping genes successfully done 113 isolates. in
pfdhfr, 94.69% (107/113) isolates showed mutations codon 59 108. double 
mutant genotype anrni mostly prevalent (107/113, 94.69%), wild-type
genotype ancsi found 5.3% (6/113) isolates. pfdhps, mutations were
recorded codon 436 437 65.49% (74/113) 23.01% (26/113) isolates,
respectively. combined pfdhfr-pfdhps genes, triple mutant anrni-fakaa most
prevalent (45/113, 39.82%) followed double mutant anrni-sakaa (37/113, 32.74%)
and quadruple mutant anrni-fgkaa (24/113, 21.24%).
conclusion: sp resistance hallmark mutations i.e., quadruple (airni-saeaa) or
quintuple (airni-sgeaa) genotype pfdhfr pfdhps absent indicates 
that sp components used act still effective study area. also
evident clinical response as+sp. monitoring efficacy this
combination (both therapeutic molecular marker study) regular
interval highly suggested record development sp resistance near
future.
