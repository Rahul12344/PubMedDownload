background & objectives: aedes aegypti important vector dengue
virus infection humans worldwide. accurate identification colonization are
the essential requirements understand vector biology well diseases
transmission potential. study, used molecular approaches 
identification ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected pilani
region rajasthan, india methods: field collected mosquito larvae were
colonized laboratory conditions. conserved genetic markers, its-2 mtcoi
were used amplification species-specific primers identify the
mosquito species/ strain. sequencing result strain phylogenetically
compared global strains mega software.
results: comprehensive multiple sequence alignment phylogenetic analysis
revealed coi gene ae. aegypti extremely low genetic variability 
one indian isolate thirumala, andhra pradesh region (genbank:
hm807262.1). however, context different geographical locations, it
indicated close similarity thailand's strain high variability when
compared madagascar strain. hand, its-2 illustrated highest
identity ae. aegypti saudi arabia (genbank: jx423807.1) whereas, high
divergence observed mayotte, france strain (genbank: kf135506).
interpretation & conclusion: findings suggest isolate from
rajasthan similar asian continent strains possibly due same
origin. understanding vectorial capacity geographically distributed 
mosquito strains enhance knowledge improve existing vector
surveillance control programme.
