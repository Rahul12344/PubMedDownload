the bud emergence (bem)46 proteins evolutionarily conserved members the
α/β-hydrolase superfamily, includes enzymes diverse functions a
wide range substrates. here, identified plasmodium bem46-like protein
(pblp) characterized throughout life cycle rodent malaria
parasite plasmodium yoelii. plasmodium bem46-like protein shown be
closely associated parasite plasma membrane asexual erythrocytic
stage schizonts exo-erythrocytic schizonts; however, pblp localizes unique
intracellular structures sporozoites. generation analysis p. yoelii
knockout (δpblp) parasite lines showed pblp important role in
erythrocytic stage merozoite development δpblp parasites forming fewer
merozoites schizogony, results decreased parasitemia when
compared wild-type (wt) parasites. δpblp parasites showed defects in
gametogenesis transmission mosquitoes; however, formed fewer
oocysts reduction number developed sporozoites infected 
mosquitoes compared wt. although δpblp sporozoites showed apparent
defect mosquito salivary gland infection, showed decreased infectivity in
hepatocytes vitro. similarly, mice infected δpblp sporozoites exhibited a
delay onset blood-stage patency, likely caused reduced
sporozoite infectivity discernible delay exo-erythrocytic merozoite
formation. data consistent model pblp important
role parasite invasive-stage morphogenesis throughout parasite life cycle.
