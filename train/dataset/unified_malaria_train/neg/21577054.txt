malaria major public health problem affecting 500 million people year. 
only anti-malarial drugs available fighting deadly disease, 
and effectiveness alarmingly dwindling drug resistant
strains. discuss recent findings evolutionary process behind the
gain resistant gene. shown that, protein become resistant to
an inhibitor, intricate stepwise order mutations must followed. the
projected evolutionary steps compared field data, reflects
the natural history drug resistant development.
