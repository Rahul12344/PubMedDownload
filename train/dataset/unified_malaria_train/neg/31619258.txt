background: malaria elimination requires diagnostic methods able detect
parasite levels well currently possible microscopy rapid
diagnostic tests. particularly true surveillance malaria the
population level includes so-called "asymptomatic" individuals.
methods: development first ultrasensitive loop mediated amplification 
method capable detecting malaria whole blood dried blood spots
(dbs) described. 18s rrna corresponding genes remain stable on
dbs 5 months targeted.
results: case plasmodium falciparum, lower limits detection of
25 parasite/ml 50-100 parasite/ml whole blood dbs obtained,
respectively. sensitivity 97.0% (95% ci 82.5-99.8) specificity 99.1% 
(95% ci 97.6-99.7) obtained detection species asymptomatic 
individuals africa asia (n = 494).
conclusion: tool ideally suited low middle-income countries where
malaria endemic ultrasensitive surveillance malaria highly desirable
for elimination.
