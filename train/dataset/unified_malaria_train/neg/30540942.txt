inflammation-induced disappearance tissue-resident macrophages represents a
key pathogen defense mechanism. using model systemic blood-stage malaria, we
studied dynamics tissue-resident macrophages multiple organs to
determine depleted refilled course disease. we
show plasmodium infection results transient loss embryonically
established resident macrophages prior parasitemia peak. fate-mapping
analysis reveals inflammatory monocytes contribute repopulation of
the emptied niches splenic red pulp macrophages hepatic kupffer cells,
while lung alveolar macrophages refill niche predominantly through
self-renewal. interestingly, local microenvironment spleen liver
can "imprint" molecular characteristics fetal-derived macrophages newly
differentiated bone marrow-derived immigrants remarkably similar gene
expression profiles turnover kinetics. thus, mononuclear phagocytic
system developed distinct effective tissue-specific strategies to
replenish emptied niches guarantee functional integrity system.
