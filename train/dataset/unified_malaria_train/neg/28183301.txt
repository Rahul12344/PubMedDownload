background: establishing vitro plasmodium falciparum culture lines from
patient parasite isolates offer deeper understanding geographic variations
of drug sensitivity mechanisms malaria pathogenesis immunity.
cellulose column filtration blood inexpensive, rapid effective
method removal host factors, leucocytes platelets,
significantly improving purification parasite dna blood sample.
methods: study, effect cellulose column filtration venous blood
on initial vitro growth p. falciparum parasite isolates tanzanian 
children admitted hospital tested. parasites allowed expand in
culture without subcultivation 5 days admission appearance 
dead parasites parasitaemia determined daily. investigate whether 
filtration effect clonality, p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 
genotyping performed using nested pcr extracted genomic dna, var
gene transcript levels investigated, using quantitative pcr extracted
rna, admission 4 days culture.
results: cellulose-filtered parasites grew higher parasitaemia faster than
non-filtered parasites seemingly due higher development ratio ring stage 
parasites progressing late stages. cellulose filtration apparent 
effect clonality var gene expression; however, evident differences were
observed 4 days culture number clones transcript
levels var genes compared time admission.
conclusions: cellulose column filtration parasitized blood cheap,
applicable method improving cultivation p. falciparum field isolates for
ex vivo based assays; however, assessing phenotype genotype cultured 
parasites, general, assumed represent vivo infection, caution is
advised.
