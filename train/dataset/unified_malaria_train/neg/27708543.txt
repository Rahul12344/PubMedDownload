cerebral malaria still deleterious health problem tropical countries. the
wide spread malarial drug resistance lack effective vaccine 
obstacles disease management prevention. parasite human genetic
factors play important roles malaria susceptibility disease severity. 
malaria parasite exerted potent selective signature human genome, 
is apparent genetic polymorphism landscape genes related to
pathogenesis. currently, much genomic data novel body knowledge,
including identification micrornas, increasingly accumulated for
the development laboratory testing cassettes cerebral malaria prevention. 
therefore, understanding underlying complex molecular basis cerebral
malaria important design strategy cerebral malaria treatment
and control.
