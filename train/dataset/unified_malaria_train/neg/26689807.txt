background: acquisition multidrug resistance plasmodium falciparum
underscores need understand underlying molecular mechanisms to
counter impact malaria control. many antimalarials whose mode of
action relates inhibition heme detoxification inside infected erythrocytes,
the digestive vacuole transporters pfcrt pfmdr1 constitute primary resistance
determinants.
results: using gene expression microarrays course parasite
intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle, compared transcriptomic profiles
between p. falciparum strains displaying mutant wild-type pfcrt varying 
pfcrt pfmdr1 expression levels. account differences time of
sampling, developed computational method termed hypergeometric analysis of
time series, combines fast fourier transform modified gene set
enrichment analysis. analysis revealed coordinated changes genes involved 
in protein catabolism, translation initiation dna/rna metabolism. also
observed differential expression genes role transport coding 
components digestive vacuole. interestingly, global comparison all
profiled transcriptomes uncovered tight correlation transcript
levels pfcrt pfmdr1, extending dozens genes, suggesting an
intricate regulatory balance order maintain optimal physiological
processes.
conclusions: study provides insight mechanisms p.
falciparum adjusts acquisition mutations gene amplification key
transporter loci mediate drug resistance. results implicate several
biological pathways may differentially regulated compensate for
impaired transporter function alterations parasite vacuole physiology.
