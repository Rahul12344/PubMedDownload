background: invasion red blood cells (rbcs) malarial parasites an
essential step life cycle plasmodium falciparum. human-parasite surface
protein interactions play critical role process. although several
interactions human parasite proteins discovered, the
mechanism related invasion remains poorly understood numerous
human-parasite protein interactions yet identified. high-throughput
screening experiments feasible malarial parasites due difficulty
in expressing parasite proteins. here, performed computational prediction 
of ppis involved malaria parasite invasion elucidate mechanism by
which invasion occurs.
results: study, expectation maximization algorithm used to
estimate probabilities domain-domain interactions (ddis). estimates ddi
probabilities used infer ppi probabilities. found our
prediction performance better based information d.
melanogaster alone information related six species used.
prediction performance assessed using protein interaction data s.
cerevisiae, indicating predicted results reliable. used the
estimates ddi probabilities infer interactions 490 parasite and
3,787 human membrane proteins. small-scale dataset used illustrate the
usability method predicting interactions human parasite
proteins. positive predictive value (ppv) lower observed s. 
cerevisiae. integrated gene expression data improve prediction accuracy and
to reduce false positives. identified 80 membrane proteins highly expressed in
the schizont stage fast fourier transform method. approximately 221
erythrocyte membrane proteins identified using published mass spectral
datasets. network consisting 205 interactions predicted. results of
network analysis suggest snare proteins parasites app humans may
function invasion rbcs parasites.
conclusions: predicted small-scale ppi network may involved in
parasite invasion rbcs integrating ddi information expression profiles.
experimental studies conducted validate predicted interactions. 
the predicted ppis help elucidate mechanism parasite invasion provide 
directions future experimental investigations.
