during plasmodium falciparum infection, host red blood cell (rbc) remodeling is
required parasite's survival. modifications mediated the
export parasite proteins rbc alter architecture rbc
membrane enable cytoadherence. probable exported proteins
also play protective role host defense response. may of
particular importance gametocyte stage life cycle is
responsible malaria transmission, since gametocyte remains contact
with blood proceeds five morphological stages (i v) its
12-day maturation. using microarray analysis, identified several genes with
encoded secretory export sequences differentially expressed during
early gametocytogenesis. one these, pfgeco, encodes predicted type iv heat
shock protein 40 (hsp40) show expressed gametocyte stages iv
and exported rbc cytoplasm. hsps traditionally induced under
stressful conditions maintain homeostasis, pfgeco expression not
increased upon heat shock, suggesting alternate function. targeted disruption 
of pfgeco indicated gene essential gametocytogenesis in
vitro, quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) showed 
no compensatory expression type iv hsp40 genes. although p.
falciparum hsp40 members implicated trafficking proteins rbc
surface, removal pfgeco affect targeting exported
gametocyte proteins. work expanded repertoire known
gametocyte-exported proteins include type iv hsp40, pfgeco.
