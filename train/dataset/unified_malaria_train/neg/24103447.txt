background: erythrocyte binding antigen (eba) 175 considered one 
of important plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) merozoite ligands
that mediate invasion erythrocytes sialated receptor:
glycophorin (gpa). effect eba 175 dimorphic alleles (f c) the
severity disease yet fully understood. therefore study was
designed assess distribution divergent dimorphic alleles p.
falciparum eba-175 (f c) three different geographical areas sudan and
the possible association dimorphism severity disease.
methods: sum 339 field isolates p. falciparum obtained patients in
three different geographical areas sudan screened dimorphic
alleles (f, c) eba-175 using nested pcr.
results: percentage f, c, mixed f/c alleles were; 41%, 51%, 8%
respectively. f c alleles showed significantly different distributions the
various geographic areas (p = 0.00). significant association between
malaria clinical manifestation p. falciparum eba-175 f c alleles
frequencies.
conclusions: study showed significant differential distribution f c
alleles different geographical malaria endemic areas. significant
association observed f c alleles different malaria
phenotypes.
