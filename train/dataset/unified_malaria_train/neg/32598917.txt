congenital toxoplasmosis parasitic disease caused toxoplasma gondii, an
obligate intracellular parasite cause fetal death/abortion can
induce damage brain eyes infected babies. environmental and
genetic factors associated t. gondii maternal immune response, drive
part pathogenesis congenital toxoplasmosis. thus, study, we
aimed investigate allelic genotypic frequencies specific single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) il17a il17ra genes, well the
production il-17a, il-33, ccl2 pregnant women, state rio
grande norte, brazil, relating along clinical
parameters, toxoplasmosis infection. pcr-rflp techniques, two snps
implicated th17 immune response, il17a rs2275913 (g> a) il17ra rs4819554
(a> g) modulation evaluated pregnant women, either infected not
infected t. gondii. women also evaluated terms plasma release
of ccl2, il-33, il-17a relate hypertension, number abortions, and
ethnic pattern. results showed g-allele snp rs2275913 (il17a)
appeared protective population, rs4819554 (il17ra) snp g 
allele associated greater susceptibility t. gondii infection [ρ
value = 0.025; or = 2.815 (1.118-7.089); ci = 95%]. none cytokines any
influence analyzed parameters (abortion hypertension). conclusion, 
our data suggest immunogenic evidence susceptibility t. gondii infection
driven rs4819554 (il17ra) snp g allele brazilian pregnant women.
further studies needed reinforce trial marker populations from
distinct geographical areas well confirm protective pattern related 
to g-allele snp rs2275913 (il17a) pregnant women.
