background: sand fly saliva shown help parasite establishment 
induce immune responses vertebrate hosts. current study, we
investigated pattern expression two phlebotomus papatasi salivary
transcripts specific physiological seasonal conditions hyperendemic
area zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) iran.
methods: sand flies collected 2012-2013, grouped according to
physiological stages unfed, fed, semi-gravid, gravid, parous,
nulliparous, infected non-infected leishmania major also based the
season collected. quantitative real-time pcr applied for
assessment expression two relevant salivary transcripts, ppsp15 and
ppsp44, associated protection exacerbation zcl, respectively.
results: expression ppsp15 ppsp44 transcripts significantly
up-regulated (1.74 1.4 folds, respectively) blood fed compared unfed
flies. among four groups fed, unfed, semi-gravid gravid flies, lowest 
levels ppsp15 ppsp44 expression observed gravid flies.
additionally, expression levels ppsp15 ppsp44 transcripts p.
papatasi collected summer significantly up-regulated (3.7 4.4
folds, respectively) compared spring collections. addition, ppsp15
transcript exhibited significant up-regulation (p < 0.05) non-infected flies
compared infected l. major.
conclusions: study contributes knowledge differential
expression salivary genes among different groups within p. papatasi
population natural field conditions. cutaneous visceral leishmaniasis
are public health importance many parts iran neighbouring countries 
where p. papatasi proven dominant sand fly vector zcl, most
prevalent endemic form disease iran. therefore, current study
could helpful understanding influence salivary genes leishmania
transmission phlebotomine sand flies. findings demonstrate the
differential expression salivary transcripts various physiological
conditions potentially influencing sand fly capacity parasite
transmission well outcome disease.
