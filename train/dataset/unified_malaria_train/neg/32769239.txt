background: artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) widely used india
and many generic preparations available. delayed response reported, 
suggesting inadequate response artesunate (as) genotypic resistance. we
designed prospective observational study assess therapeutic response,
elaborate pharmacokinetics identify plasmodium falciparum kelch 13
(pfk13) propeller gene polymorphisms among hospitalized indian patients with
severe malaria.
methods: collected blood samples adult patients severe p. falciparum
or mixed (p. falciparum p. vivax) malaria act. calculated parasite 
clearance (cl) half-life using worldwide antimalarial resistance network
(wwarn) online parasite clearance estimator (pce). used liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrophoto-metry method simultaneous
quantification dihydroartemisinin. genotyped longitudinally archived
dna samples obtained pre-treatment (day 0) study point mutations the
pfk13 propeller domain.
results: total 54 patients malaria included, majority
fulfilling definitions severe malaria. median parasite cl slope
half-life estimated 6.44 hours (interquartile range 4.79-10.24). as
pharmacokinetics, assessed 17 patients, found similar groups
with rapid (<48 hours) slow cl (>48 hours) parasites. known mutations
associated artemisinin resistance southeast asia observed our
study participants.
conclusions: slow parasite cl seen high parasite burden without
genotypic evidence resistance. need standardize definitions
of therapeutic efficacy cases severe malaria.
