the routine study human malaria liver-stage biology vitro hampered by
low infection efficiency human hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) lines (<0.1%),
poor understanding steady-state hcc biology, lack appropriate tools for
trace sample analysis. hc-04 hcc supports complete development
of human malaria parasites. hypothesized hccs various intermediate
stages epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) hc-04s retain
epithelial characteristics permit infection. developed facile
analytical approach test hypothesis viz. hc-04 response hepatocyte
growth factor (hgf). used online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (2d-lc-ms/ms) quantify protein expression profiles hc-04 
pre-/post-hgf treatment validated results rt-qpcr microscopy. we
successfully increased protein identification efficiency offline-2d methods 
by 12-fold, using less sample material, allowing robust protein quantification.
we observed expected up-regulation down-regulation emt protein markers 
response hgf, also unexpected cellular responses. also observed that
hc-04 generally susceptible hgf-mediated signaling was
observed hepg2, widely used, poor malaria liver stage-hcc model. our
analytical approach understanding basic biology hc-04 helps us
understand factors may influence utility model malaria
liver-stage development. observed hc-04 treatment hgf prior the
addition plasmodium falciparum sporozoites facilitate cell invasion,
which suggests unlinking effect hgf malaria liver stage development
from hepatocyte invasion. finally, 2d-lc-ms/ms approach broadly
applicable experimental strategy prove useful analysis various
hepatocyte-pathogen interactions, tumor progression, early disease events.
