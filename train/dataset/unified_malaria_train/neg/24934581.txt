loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) innovative molecular
technique validated point-of-care testing diagnose malaria. 
molecular detection tracking anti-malarial drug resistance mainly based
on highly sophisticated, costly time-consuming techniques. the
validation resistance-associated gene mutations malaria parasites, is
a need develop rapid, easy-to-use molecular tests anti-malarial drug
resistance genotyping. lamp could developed point-of-care test to
rapidly detect anti-malarial drug resistance-associated molecular markers,
thereby help detecting monitoring drug resistance surveillance studies.
