malaria still represents major health problem yemen, particularly in
hodeidah, despite continuing efforts eliminate it. absence of
clinically proven vaccines, chemotherapy antimalarials still greatly
needed. chloroquine (cq) popular drug choice malaria
control. however, plasmodium falciparum resistance cq one main
obstacles malaria control elimination. although cq longer the
recommended antimalarial chemotherapy, remained number one
over-the-counter antimalarial drug many endemic areas, including yemen, is
still used self-medication. addition, promising reports cq efficacy
reversal many african countries brought scene. led 
to growing interest possibility re-introduction, particularly
with concerns raised parasite resistance artemisinin-based
combination therapies. therefore, present study aimed analyzing the
cq-associated pfcrt 76t mutation p. falciparum isolates patients with
uncomplicated falciparum malaria hodeidah, west yemen. association of
treatment-seeking behaviors antimalarial drug use pfcrt 76t mutant
allele also studied. revealed still sustained high
frequency molecular marker among parasite isolates associated with
younger age, decreased parasite density presence gametocytes blood.
delay seeking treatment frequent use antimalarials behaviors
significantly associated presence pfcrt 76t mutant allele among
patients reporting history malaria treatment.
