background & objectives: : insecticide applied optimum dosage coverage
delays development resistance disease vectors. study aimed to
test hypothesis whether decrease exposure insecticide leads decrease
in selection insecticide resistance mosquitoes. mosquitoes were
variably exposed insecticide laboratory simulating variations in
insecticide sprays applied field.
methods: : study carried ddt resistant adults anopheles
stephensi. mosquitoes differentially exposed impregnated papers ddt
(4%), differentially masked 25, 50, 75% area an
unimpregnated whatman no.1 filter paper, positive control without any
masking, i.e. 100% exposure area. study conducted five generations
and generation mosquitoes exposed differentially masked
impregnated papers, percent mortality calculated.
results: : observed survival rate differential exposures the
increase heterozygous genotype resistance-susuceptible (rs) frequency.
resistant gene frequency differential exposures (25 75%) range
of 0.38-0.54 f0 generation, increased 0.84-0.93 f4
generation. 100% exposure 0.18 f0 generation, increased to
0.58 f4 generation. resistant gene frequencies population
showed increasing trend decrease exposure contrast complete
exposure.
interpretation & conclusion: : variable simulated exposures resulted in
precipitation increased resistance complete exposure resulted lower
levels resistance, signifying importance optimum dosage coverage in
the indoor residual spray delaying/avoiding development insecticide
resistance disease vectors.
