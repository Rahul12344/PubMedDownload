background: haemosporidians (apicomplexa, protista) obligate heteroxenous
parasites vertebrates blood-sucking dipteran insects. avian
haemosporidians comprise 250 species traditionally classified four
genera, plasmodium, haemoproteus, leucocytozoon, fallisia. however, analyses 
of mitochondrial cytb gene revealed vast variety lineages yet linked
to morphospecies. study aimed analyse discuss data of
haemosporidian lineages isolated birds family turdidae, visualise 
host geographic distribution using dna haplotype networks suggest
directions taxonomy research parasite species.
methods: haemosporidian cytb sequence data 350 thrushes analysed for
the present study complemented cytb data avian haemosporidians
gathered genbank malavi database. maximum likelihood trees were
calculated identify clades featuring lineages isolated turdidae species. 
for clade, dna haplotype networks calculated provided with
information host geographic distribution.
results: species turdidae, study identified 82 plasmodium, 37
haemoproteus, 119 leucocytozoon lineages, 68, 28, 112 mainly
found host group. lineages cluster clades, are
shown dna haplotype networks. lineages leucocytozoon clades were
almost exclusively isolated thrushes usually restricted one host
genus, whereas plasmodium haemoproteus networks featured multiple
lineages also recovered passeriform non-passeriform birds.
conclusion: study represents first attempt summarise information on
the haemosporidian parasite lineages whole bird family. analyses allowed
the identification numerous groups related lineages, been
linked morphologically defined species yet, revealed several cases in
which cytb lineages probably assigned wrong morphospecies. these
taxonomic issues addressed comparing distributional patterns cytb
lineages data original species descriptions literature.
the authors also discuss availability sequence data emphasise that
malavi database considered extremely valuable addition genbank,
but replacement.
