throughout many developing tropical countries around world, malaria
remains significant threat human health. one barrier malaria elimination 
is ability safely administer primaquine chemotherapy radical cure 
of malaria infections populations high prevalence of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency. current study, a
field trial world's first quantitative, point-of-care assay measuring 
g6pd activity conducted haiti. performance carestart biosensor 
analyzer compared gold standard spectrophotometric assay and
genotyping g6pd allele schoolchildren (n = 343) ouest
department haiti. population, 19.5% participants (67/343) 
form g6pd deficiency (< 60% residual activity) 9.9% (34/343) had
moderate-to-severe g6pd deficiency (< 30% residual activity). overall, 18.95% 
participants presence a-allele (65/343) 7.87% (27/343)
considered high risk drug-induced hemolysis (hemizygous males and
homozygous females). compared spectrophotometric assay, sensitivity 
and specificity determine participants < 60% residual activity 53.7%
and 94.6%, respectively; participants 30% residual activity, the
sensitivity specificity 5.9% 99.7%, respectively. biosensor
overestimated activity deficient individuals underestimated in
participants normal g6pd activity, indicating potential systematic
measurement error. thus, suggest current version biosensor
lacks adequate sensitivity improved prior use a
point-of-care diagnostic g6pd deficiency.
