background: plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein pfhrp2 measurement is
used widely diagnosis, recently severity assessment in
falciparum malaria. pfhrp2 gene highly polymorphic, deletion the
entire gene reported laboratory field isolates. issues
potentially confound interpretation pfhrp2 measurements.
methods: studies designed detect deletion pfhrp2 paralog pfhrp3
were undertaken samples patients seven countries contributing the
largest hospital-based severe malaria trial (aquamat). quantitative
relationship sequence polymorphism pfhrp2 plasma concentration was
examined samples selected sites mozambique tanzania.
results: evidence deletion either pfhrp2 pfhrp3 77 
samples lowest pfhrp2 plasma concentrations across seven countries.
pfhrp2 sequence diversity high haplotypes shared among 66
samples sequenced. correlation pfhrp2 sequence length or
repeat type pfhrp2 plasma concentration.
conclusions: findings indicate sequence polymorphism a
significant cause variation pfhrp2 concentration plasma samples from
african children. justifies development plasma pfhrp2
concentration method assessing african children may severe
falciparum malaria. data also add existing evidence base supporting
the use rapid diagnostic tests based pfhrp2 detection.
