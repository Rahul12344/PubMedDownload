background: present, malaria cases suriname occur predominantly migrants
and people living and/or working areas gold mining operations. a
molecular survey performed plasmodium falciparum isolates originating from
persons gold mining areas assess extent role mining areas as
reservoirs malaria resistance suriname.
methods: status 14 putative resistance-associated single nucleotide
polymorphisms pfdhfr, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfatp6 genes assessed 28 
samples gold miners diagnosed p. falciparum malaria using polymerase
chain reaction amplification restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis, results compared earlier data nonmining
villagers.
results: isolates miners showed high degree homogeneity, fixed
pfdhfr ile51/asn108, pfmdr1 phe184/asp1042/tyr1246, pfcrt thr76 mutant
genotype, exclusively wild-type genotype observed pfmdr1 asn86
and pfdhfr ala16, cys59, ile164, pfatp6 positions
leu263/ala623/ser769. small variations observed pfmdr1 s1034c. no
statistically significant difference could detected allele frequencies
between mining nonmining villagers.
conclusion: despite increased risk malaria infection individuals
working/living gold mining areas, detect increase mutation
frequency 14 analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms. therefore, mining
areas suriname cannot yet considered reservoirs malaria resistance.
