mosquito salivary glands well known facilitate meal acquisition, however
the fundamental question adult female salivary gland manages molecular
responses sugar versus blood meal uptake remains unanswered. to
investigate responses, analyzed total 58.5 million raw reads
generated two independent rnaseq libraries salivary glands collected 
from 3-4 day-old sugar blood fed anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes.
comprehensive functional annotation analysis 10,931 contigs unraveled that
salivary glands may encode diverse nature proteins response distinct
physiological feeding status. digital gene expression analysis pcr validation
indicated first blood meal significantly alters molecular architecture
of salivary glands. comparative microscopic analysis also revealed first
blood meal uptake causes alteration least 12-22% of
morphological features salivary glands also results cellular
changes e.g. apoptosis, confirming together adult female salivary glands are
specialized organs manage meal specific responses. unraveling underlying
mechanism mosquito salivary gene expression, controlling dual feeding
associated responses may provide new opportunity control vector borne
diseases.
