background: anopheles sinensis major malaria vector china southeast
asia. vector control one effective measures prevent malaria
transmission. however, little transcriptome information available for
the malaria vector. better understand biological basis malaria
transmission develop novel effective means vector control, is
a need build transcriptome dataset functional genomics analysis by
large-scale rna sequencing (rna-seq).
methods: provide comprehensive complete transcriptome an.
sinensis, eggs, larvae, pupae, male adults female adults rna pooled
together cdna preparation, sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing
technology assembled unigenes. unigenes analyzed in
their genome mapping, functional annotation, homology, codon usage bias and
simple sequence repeats (ssrs).
results: approximately 51.6 million clean reads obtained, trimmed, and
assembled 38,504 unigenes average length 571 bp, n50 of
711 bp, average gc content 51.26%. among them, 98.4% unigenes could 
mapped onto reference genome, 69% unigenes could annotated with
known biological functions. homology analysis identified certain numbers an.
sinensis unigenes showed homology putative 1:1 orthologues with
genomes dipteran species. codon usage bias analyzed 1,904 ssrs
were detected, provide effective molecular markers population 
genetics species.
conclusions: data analysis provide comprehensive transcriptomic 
resource characteristics currently available an. sinensis, will
facilitate genetic, genomic studies, vector control an. sinensis.
