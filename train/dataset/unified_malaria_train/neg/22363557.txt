changing environmental conditions human encroachment natural habitats
bring human populations closer novel sources parasites, might then
develop new emerging diseases. diseases transmitted host generalist
vectors special interest due capacity move pathogens into
novel hosts. hypothesize humans using forests recreation exposed 
to broad range parasites wild animals vectors. corollary of
this new vector-host, parasite-host, vector-parasite associations
could eventually develop. thus, expect observe atypical vector-host
associations. using molecular bloodmeal analysis via amplification mtdna
coi gene identified vertebrate hosts culicoides (diptera:
ceratopogonidae) species sub-urban forest southwestern germany.
bloodmeals also checked haemosporidian infections amplifying a
fragment mtdna cyt b gene. identified total 20 culicoides species,
thirteen fed humans. 105 screened bloodmeals obtained high
quality sequences 77 samples, 73 (94.8%) originated humans, two from
livestock (bos taurus equus caballus), two wild birds (sylvia
atricapilla turdus merula). found four culicoides species previously 
assumed feed exclusively either birds (c. kibunensis) domestic mammals
(c. chiopterus, c. deltus, c. scoticus) fed also humans. total six
culicoides abdomens infected avian haemosporidian parasites (plasmodium
or haemoproteus), four abdomens contained blood derived humans. our
results suggest parasites wild animals may transferred humans
through infectious bites culicoides vectors. further, show culicoides 
vectors believed specialist specific vertebrate groups have
plastic feeding preferences, culicoides susceptible infection 
plasmodium parasites, though vector viability must still experimentally
demonstrated.
