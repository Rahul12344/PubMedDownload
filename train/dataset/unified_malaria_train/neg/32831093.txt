plasmodium vivax largely neglected past century, despite a
widespread recognition burden across region endemic. the
parasite invades reticulocytes, employing interaction plasmodium
vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) human duffy antigen receptor for
chemokines (darc). however, p. vivax observed duffy-negative
individuals, presenting potentially serious public health problem the
majority african populations duffy-negative. invasion duffy-negative
reticulocytes suggested duplication pvdbp novel
protein encoded p. vivax erythrocyte binding protein (ebp) genes. the
emergence spread specific p. vivax strains ability invade
duffy-negative reticulocytes has, therefore, drawn substantial attention and
further complicated epidemiology public health implication vivax
malaria. given right environment vectorial capacity transmission
coupled parasite's ability invade duffy-negative individuals, p.
vivax could increase epidemiological significance africa. review, 
authors present accruing knowledge paradigm shift p. vivax invasion 
duffy-negative reticulocytes established mechanism invading only
duffy-positive individuals offer perspective epidemiological
diagnostic public health implication africa.
