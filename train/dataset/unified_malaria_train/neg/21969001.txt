severe malarial anemia (sma) leading cause morbidity mortality in
children residing regions plasmodium falciparum transmission is
holoendemic. although largely unexplored children sma, interleukin-18
(il-18) important regulating innate acquired immunity inflammatory 
and infectious diseases. such, selected two functional single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) il-18 promoter (-137g→c [rs187238] -607c→a
[rs1946518]) whose haplotypes encompass significant genetic variation due 
presence strong linkage disequilibrium among variants. relationship 
between genotypes/haplotypes, sma (hemoglobin [hb], <5.0 g/dl], and
longitudinal clinical outcomes investigated kenyan children (n =
719). multivariate logistic regression analyses controlling age, gender,
sickle cell trait, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency, hiv-1,
and bacteremia revealed carriage -607aa genotype associated 
protection sma (odds ratio [or] = 0.440 [95% confidence interval {ci} =
0.21 0.90], p = 0.031) children acute infection. contrast, carriers
of -137g/-607c (gc) haplotype increased susceptibility sma (or = 2.050
[95% ci = 1.04 4.05], p = 0.039). measurement il-18 gene expression in
peripheral blood leukocytes demonstrated elevated il-18 transcripts were
associated reduced hemoglobin concentrations (ρ = -0.293, p = 0.010) and
that carriers "susceptible" gc haplotype elevated il-18 transcripts (p
= 0.026). longitudinal investigation clinical outcomes 3-year follow-up
period revealed carriers rare cc haplotype (∼1% frequency) 5.76
times higher mortality noncarriers (p = 0.001). results presented here
demonstrate il-18 promoter haplotypes condition elevated il-18 gene
products acute infection associated increased risk sma.
furthermore, carriage rare cc haplotype significantly increases risk
of childhood mortality.
