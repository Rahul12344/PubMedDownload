the dynamic chromatin landscape displaying combinatorial complexity the
epigenome impacts gene expression underlies many events differentiation
and cell cycle progression. past years, epigenetic mechanisms have
emerged important processes involved tight gene regulation malaria
parasites, plasmodium spp. focusing predominantly plasmodium falciparum, the
species associated severe form disease, many advances have
been made understanding interaction transcriptional
regulation epigenetic mechanisms pivotal processes regulating life 
cycle progression, host parasite interactions parasite adaptation host
environment. review focuses epigenome effect on
transcriptional regulation p. falciparum, highlighting unique,
evolutionary diverse features.
