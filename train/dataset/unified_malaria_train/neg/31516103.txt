although ethiopia overall lower prevalence plasmodium falciparum among 
countries africa, emergence drug resistance could seriously hinder
elimination efforts. using samples collected five therapeutic efficacy
studies conducted 2007-11, evaluated prevalence putative drug
resistance mutations pfcrt, pfmdr1, kelch13 genes time those
studies, well ama1 gene genetic relatedness using pooled amplicon
deep sequencing approach. among sites, kelch13 gene showed mutations, 
whereas pfcrt cviet genotype fixed populations. contrast, the
mdr1 gene demonstrated frequencies resistant genotypes ranging 10 100%
at amino acid position 86 0% 57.8% amino acid position 1246.
although observed low degree haplotype sharing sites, did
observe considerable haplotype sharing within sites time. suggests that
p. falciparum populations ethiopia isolated able persist through
time.
