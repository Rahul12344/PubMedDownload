prompt diagnosis appropriate treatment malaria remain hallmark for
reducing malaria-related mortality high transmission areas. plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein2 (pfhrp2) based rapid diagnostic tests (rdt)
play vital role prompt accurate malaria diagnosis. however, pfhrp2 gene 
deletion threatens rdt test sensitivity. study reports presence of
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes deletion among parasite isolates nigeria. febrile
children screened using histidine-rich protein (hrp2) specific rdt
(sd-bioline rdt) microscopy p. falciparum infections. rdt negative
samples re-evaluated polymerase chain reaction (pcr). presence of
parasite rdt false negative cases randomly selected rdt positive cases
were validated using pcrs targeting glutamate-rich protein (glurp) merozoite 
surface proteins (msp-1 msp-2). thereafter, exon 2 pfhrp2 pfhrp3 
amplified, sanger sequenced. total 511 febrile children enrolled
out 309 (61%) positive rdt. presence pfhrp2 pfhrp3
genes analyzed 66 pcr positive samples comprising 31 rdt false
negative 35 rdt true positive randomly selected samples. pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes failed amplify 17% (11/66) 6% (4/66) samples,
respectively. seven eleven samples pfhrp2 deletion four had
both pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions. absence pfhrp2 gene may be
responsible seven rdt false negative cases observed. three rdt positive
cases lacked pfhrp2 whereas pfhrp3 absent four rdt false negative
cases. pfhrp2 pfhrp3 amino acid repeat sequences highly diverse. the
p. falciparum isolates lacking pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes may circulating and
contributing rdt false negativity nigeria. studies larger
population seasonally defined cases needed determine extent of
pfhrp2/3 genes deletion different geographical areas nigeria.
