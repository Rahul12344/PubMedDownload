background: urgent need effective vaccine control and
eradicate malaria, one serious global infectious diseases. plasmodium
merozoite surface protein 4 (msp4) listed blood-stage subunit
vaccine candidate malaria. infection plasmodium ovale species including 
p. ovale wallikeri p. ovale curtisi, also source malaria burden in
tropical regions sometimes mixed plasmodium species.
however, little known p. ovale msp4.
methods: msp4 gene amplified polymerase chain reaction using
genomic dna extracted blood samples 46 patients infected p. ovale
spp. amplified products sequenced. open reading frames predicted as
immunogenic peptides consisting 119 97 amino acids p. ovale curtisi
msp4 (pocmsp4) p. ovale wallikeri msp4 (powmsp4), respectively, selected
for protein expression. recombinant proteins (rpomsp4) expressed in
escherichia coli, purified, analysed, immunized balb/c mice. the
specificity anti-msp4-immunoglobulin (ig) g antibodies evaluated by
western blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, cellular immune
responses analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays.
results: full peptide sequences pocmsp4 powmsp4 completely conserved 
in clinical isolates, except epidermal growth factor-like domain at
the carboxyl terminus one mutation observed one p. o. wallikeri
isolate. further, truncated pomsp4 segments successfully expressed and
purified ~ 32 kda proteins. importantly, high antibody responses with
end-point titres ranging 1:10,000 1:2,560,000 immunized mouse
groups observed, high igg avidity pocmsp4 (80.5%) powmsp4
(92.3%). furthermore, rpocmsp4 rpowmsp4 cross-reacted with
anti-powmsp4-specific anti-pocmsp4-specific antibodies. additionally,
anti-pomsp4 igg antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity reacting against
rpomsp1 rpoama1. lastly, pocmsp4- powmsp4-immunized mice induced cellular
immune responses pocmsp4 (36%) powmsp4 cells (15.8%) splenocyte
proliferation assays.
conclusion: findings study suggest conservation pomsp4 protein
sequences high immunogenicity observed rpomsp4. furthermore, induction
of immune responses pocmsp4- powmsp4-immunized mice informed both
humoral cellular immune responses play crucial roles pomsp4 in
protection.
