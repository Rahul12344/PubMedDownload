background: reported malaria cases americas reduced about
one-half million 2012. advance towards elimination disease, is
necessary gain insights malaria parasite evolving, including
the emergence, spread persistence new haplotypes affected regions. in
here, genetic diversity three major p. vivax merozoite genes was
analyzed.
methods: p. vivax-infected blood samples obtained southern mexico (smx)
during 2006-2007, nucleotide sequences achieved for: 42 kda carboxyl
fragment merozoite surface protein-1 (msp1 42 ), domains i-ii the
apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1 i-ii ), domain ii duffy binding
protein (dbp ii ). gene polymorphism examined haplotype networks were
developed depict parasite relationships smx. genetic diversity,
recombination natural selection analyzed degree of
differentiation determined fst values.
results: diversity p. vivax merozoite genes smx less of
parasites geographic origins, dbp ii  < ama1 i-ii  < msp1 42 .
ama1 i-ii msp1 42 exposed numerous haplotypes exclusive smx.
while, dbp ii haplotypes smx separated one three mutational
steps, networks ama1 i-ii msp1 42 complex; loops and
numerous mutational steps evidenced, likely due recombination. sings of
local diversification evident msp1 42 . sixteen combined haplotypes
were determined; one haplotypes detected 2006 highly frequent
in 2007. rm value higher msp1 42 ama1 i-ii, being
insignificant dbp ii . dn-ds value highly significant ama1 i-ii
and lesser dbp ii . f st values higher dbp ii msp1 42 , 
and low ama1 i-ii .
conclusions: smx, p. vivax ama1 i-ii , dbp ii msp1 42 demonstrated limited
diversity, exhibited differentiated parasite population. results
suggest differential intensities selective forces operating 
gene fragments, probably related timing, length exposure and
function reticulocyte adhesion invasion. therefore, finding 
essential mono multivalent vaccine development and epidemiological
surveillance.
