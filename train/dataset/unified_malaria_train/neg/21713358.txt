introduction: genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum one 
major obstacles success anti-malaria drug therapy. provides the
parasite ability evade host's immune response generating changes 
its antigenic composition resistance antimalarial drugs.
objective: genetic diversity p.falciparum characterized 4 colombian
localities analysis polymorphic genes.
materials methods: eighty-one samples obtained patients with
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria screened polymorphic variants of
msp1, msp2 (merozoite surface proteins) glurp (glutamate-rich protein) a
multiplex pcr assay. geographic regions sampled tierralta (córdoba), 
northwestern colombia orinoco river watershed eastern
colombia--inírida (guainía), la carpa (guaviare), casuarito (vichada).
results: mad20 variant detected samples analyzed msp1
gene. msp2 gene, ic allelic family found 96.3% samples 
as compared 4.9% samples fc family. families showed size 
polymorphism bands 467 513 basepairs (bp) ic 286 300
bp fc. pcr products differing sizes detected glurp gene and
grouped 5 size classes: (600-699 bp) 2.5%, ii (700-799 bp) 19.8%, iii
(800-899 bp) 72.8%, iv (900-999 bp) 1.2% v (1000-1099 bp) 3.7%.
conclusions: msp1 molecular marker provide information for
differentiating p. falciparum parasite populations. msp2 gene more
suitable studying genetic diversity, however, studies are
required identify polymorphisms within two allelic families. glurp
gene showed great genetic diversity circulating p. falciparum populations,
and suggested gene may useful distinguishing between
recrudescence reinfection.
