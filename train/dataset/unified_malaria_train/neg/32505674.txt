defining protein-protein interactions fundamental understanding gene
function. protein-fragment complementation assays used analysis
of protein-protein interactions various organisms. split-dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) protein-fragment complementation assay utilises two
complementary fragments enzyme fused pair potentially interacting 
proteins. proteins interact, dhfr fragments associate, fold into
their native structure, reconstitute function confer resistance to
antifolate drugs. show murine dhfr fragments fused interacting
proteins reconstitute functional enzyme confer resistance antifolate
drug wr99210 plasmodium falciparum. data demonstrate split-dhfr
method used detect vivo protein-protein interactions the
parasite. additionally, show split-dhfr fragments used as
selection markers, permitting simultaneous selection two plasmids the
presence single antifolate drug. taken together, experiments show that
split-dhfr represents valuable tool characterisation plasmodium
protein function genetic manipulation parasite.
