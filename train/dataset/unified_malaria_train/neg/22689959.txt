anopheles stephensi mosquitoes expressing m1c3, m4b7, m2a10 single-chain
antibodies (scfvs) significantly lower levels infection compared to
controls challenged plasmodium falciparum, human malaria pathogen.
these scfvs derived antibodies specific parasite chitinase, the
25Â kda protein circumsporozoite protein, respectively. transgenes
comprising m2a10 combination either m1c3 m4b7 inserted into
previously-characterized mosquito chromosomal "docking" sites using site-specific
recombination. transgene expression evaluated four different genomic
locations docking site permitted tissue- sex-specific expression
was researched further. fitness studies docking site dual scfv transgene
strains detected one significant fitness cost: adult docking-site males
displayed late-onset reduction survival. m4b7/m2a10 mosquitoes
challenged p. falciparum sporozoites, parasite stage
infective humans, three four experiments. sporozoites detected
in m1c3/m2a10 mosquitoes challenge experiments genes induced at
developmentally relevant times. studies support conclusion that
expression single copy dual scfv transgene completely inhibit
parasite development without imposing fitness cost mosquito.
