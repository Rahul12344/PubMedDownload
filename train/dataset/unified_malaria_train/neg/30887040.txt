genomic structural variants (svs) distributed nonrandomly across human
genome. "hotspots" svs implicated evolutionary innovations,
as well medical conditions. however, evolutionary biomedical features 
of hotspots remain incompletely understood. here, analyzed data from
2,504 genomes construct refined map 1,148 sv hotspots human genomes.
we confirmed segmental duplication-related nonallelic homologous
recombination important mechanistic driver sv hotspot formation.
however, surprise, also found majority svs hotspots not
form recombination-based mechanisms, suggesting diverse mechanistic 
and selective forces shaping hotspots. indeed, evolutionary analyses showed
that majority sv hotspots within gene-poor regions evolve under
relaxed negative selection neutrality. however, still found small subset 
of sv hotspots harboring genes enriched anthropologically crucial
functions evolve geography-specific balancing adaptive forces.
these include two independent hotspots different chromosomes affecting alpha
and beta hemoglobin gene clusters. biomedically, found sv hotspots
coincide breakpoints clinically relevant, large de novo svs,
significantly often genome-wide expectations. example, showed
that breakpoints multiple large svs, lead idiopathic short
stature, coincide sv hotspots. therefore, mutational instability sv
hotpots likely enables chromosomal breaks lead pathogenic structural
variation formations. overall, study contributes better understanding of
the mutational adaptive landscape genome.
