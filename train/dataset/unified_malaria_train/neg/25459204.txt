understanding malaria parasites move populations important,
particularly given potential malaria reintroduced areas 
it previously eliminated. examine distribution malaria genetics
across seven sites within democratic republic congo (drc) two nearby
countries, ghana kenya, order understand relatedness malaria
parasites varies across space, whether barriers flow of
malaria parasites within drc across borders. parasite dna retrieved
from dried blood spots 7 demographic health survey sample clusters in
the drc. malaria genetic characteristics parasites ghana kenya were
also obtained. 9 geographic sites (7 drc, 1 ghana 1 kenya), a
pair-wise rst statistic calculated, indicating genetic distance between
malaria parasites found locations. mapping genetics across spatial
extent study area indicates complex genetic landscape, relatedness
between two proximal sites may relatively high (rst > 0.64) low
(rst < 0.05), distal sites also exhibit high low genetic
similarity. mantel's tests suggest malaria genetics differ geographic
distances increase. principal coordinate analysis suggests genetically
related samples co-located. barrier analysis reveals significant
barriers gene flow locations. malaria genetics drc a
complex fragmented landscape. limited exchange genes across space is
reflected greater genetic distance malaria parasites isolated at
greater geographic distances. is, however, evidence close genetic ties 
between distally located sample locations, indicating movement malaria
parasites flow genes driven factors distance decay.
this research demonstrates contributions spatial disease ecology and
landscape genetics make understanding evolutionary dynamics of
infectious diseases.
