background: habitat types affect vector pathogen distribution and
transmission dynamics. prevalence genetic diversity plasmodium spp. in
two eastern chimpanzee populations-kalinzu forest reserve, uganda issa
valley, tanzania-inhabiting different habitat types investigated. follow
up study effect host sex age infections patterns kalinzu forest 
reserve chimpanzees determined.
methods: molecular methods employed detect plasmodium dna faecal
samples collected savanna-woodland (issa valley) forest (kalinzu forest 
reserve) chimpanzee populations.
results: based cytochrome-b pcr assay, 32 160 kalinzu chimpanzee
faecal samples positive plasmodium dna, whilst positive sample was
detected 171 issa valley chimpanzee faecal samples. sequence analysis revealed
that previously known laverania species (plasmodium reichenowi, plasmodium
billbrayi plasmodium billcollinsi) circulating kalinzu
chimpanzees. significantly higher proportion young individuals tested
positive infections, switching plasmodium spp. reported one
individual. amongst positive individuals sampled once, success 
of amplification plasmodium dna faeces varied sampling time.
conclusion: study showed marked differences prevalence malaria
parasites among free ranging chimpanzee populations living different habitats.
in addition, clear pattern plasmodium infections respect host age
was found. results presented study contribute understanding the
ecological aspects underlying malaria infections wild. nevertheless,
integrative long-term studies vector abundance, plasmodium diversity during
different seasons sites would provide insight occurrence,
distribution ecology pathogens.
