background: persistent growing gap availability sequenced 
genomes ability assign functions sequenced genes led us explore 
ways maximize information content automated annotation studies of
anopheline mosquitos. specifically, use genome content analysis large
number previously sequenced anopheline mosquitos follow loss gain
of protein families evolutionary history group. importance
of endeavor lies potential comparative genomic studies between
anopheles closely related non-vector species reveal ancestral genome
content dynamics involved vector competence. addition, comparisons within
anopheles could identify genome content changes responsible variation 
vectorial capacity family important parasite vectors.
results: competence capacity p. falciparum vectors appear be
phylogenetically constrained within anophelinae. instead, using ancestral
reconstruction methods, suggest previously unexamined component of
vector biology, anopheline nucleotide metabolism, may contribute unique
status anophelines p. falciparum vectors. fitness effects of
nucleotide co-option p. falciparum parasites anopheline hosts not
yet known, results suggest anopheline genome content may responding
to selection pressure p. falciparum. whether response defensive, 
an attempt redress improper nucleotide balance resulting p. falciparum
infection, perhaps symbiotic, resulting as-yet-unknown mutualism
between anophelines p. falciparum, open question deserves 
study.
conclusions: clearly, wealth functional information gained
from detailed manual genome annotation, yet rapid increase number of
available sequences means researchers time or
resources manually annotate sequence data generate. believe
that efforts maximize amount information obtained automated
annotation help address functional annotation deficit most
evolutionary biologists face, demonstrate value an
approach.
