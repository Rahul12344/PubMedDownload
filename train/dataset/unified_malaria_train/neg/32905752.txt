mosquito-transmitted diseases, including malaria dengue, major threat
to human health around globe, affecting millions year. diverse array
of next-generation tools designed eliminate mosquito populations or
to replace mosquitoes less capable transmitting key
pathogens. many new approaches built recent advances in
crispr/cas9-based genome editing. initiatives driven development
of pathogen-resistant lines, new genetics-based sexing methods, new methods
of driving desirable genetic traits mosquito populations. many other
emerging tools involve microorganisms, including two strategies involving
wolbachia achieving great success field. time, 
mosquito-associated bacteria, fungi, even viruses represent untapped sources 
of new mosquitocidal antipathogen compounds. although still hurdles 
to overcome, prospect approaches reduce impact these
diseases highly encouraging.
