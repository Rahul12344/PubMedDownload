adenoviral vectors induce b cell immune responses ags encoded the
recombinant vector. mhc class ii invariant chain (ii) used an
adjuvant enhance cell responses tethered ag encoded adenoviral
vectors. study, modified ii adjuvant insertion furin
recognition site (ii-fur) obtain secreted version ii. test the
capacity adjuvant enhance immune responses, recombined vectors to
encode plasmodium falciparum virulence factors: two cysteine-rich interdomain
regions (cidr) α1 (it4var19 pfclinvar30 var genes), expressed dimeric
ag. domains members highly polymorphic protein family involved 
the vascular sequestration immune evasion parasites malaria. ii-fur
molecule directed secretion ags african green monkey cells and
functioned adjuvant mhc class ii presentation cell
hybridomas. mice, ii-fur adjuvant induced similar cell response, as
previously demonstrated ii, accelerated enhanced specific ab
response cidr ags, increased binding capacity cognate
endothelial protein c receptor, enhanced breadth response toward
different cidrs. also demonstrate endosomal sorting signal,
secretion, c-terminal part ii needed full adjuvant effect
for ab responses. conclude engineered secretion ii adjuvant-tethered
ags establishes single adjuvant delivery vehicle platform potent 
b cell-dependent immunity.
