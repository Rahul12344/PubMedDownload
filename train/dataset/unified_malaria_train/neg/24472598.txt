background: insecticide resistance monitoring malaria mosquitoes essential 
for guiding rational use insecticides vector control programs.
resistance bioassay first step insecticide monitoring lays an
important foundation molecular examination resistance mechanisms. the
literature, various mosquito sample collection preparation methods 
used, mosquito sample collection preparation methods affect
insecticide susceptibility bioassay results largely unknown. objectives of
this study determine whether mosquito sample collection preparation
methods affected bioassay results, may cause incorrect classification of
mosquito resistance status.
methods: study conducted anopheles sinensis mosquitoes two study
sites central china. three mosquito sample collection preparation methods 
were compared insecticide susceptibility, kdr frequencies metabolic
enzyme activities: 1) adult mosquitoes collected field; 2) f1 adults
from field collected, blood-fed mosquitoes; 3) adult mosquitoes reared from
field collected larvae.
results: mosquito sample collection preparation methods significantly
affected mortality rates standard tube resistance bioassay. mortality 
rate field-collected female adults 10-15% higher mosquitoes reared
from field-collected larvae f1 adults field collected blood-fed females.
this pattern consistent mosquitoes two study sites. high kdr
mutation frequency (85-95%) l1014f allele predominant mutation was
found study populations. field-collected female adults consistently
exhibited highest monooxygenase gst activities. higher mortality rate
observed field-collected female mosquitoes may caused a
mixture mosquitoes different ages, older mosquitoes more
susceptible deltamethrin younger mosquitoes.
conclusions: female adults reared field-collected larvae resistance
bioassays recommended minimize effect confounding factors as
mosquito age blood feeding status reliable reproducible
mortality may obtained.
