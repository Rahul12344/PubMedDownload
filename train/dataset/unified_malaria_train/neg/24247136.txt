quinine cinchona-derived alkaloids, although recently supplanted the
artemisinins (arts), continue important treatment severe malaria.
quinine quinidine narrow therapeutic indices, safer quinine analog
is desirable, particularly continued threat antimalarial drug
resistance. hydroxyethylapoquinine (heaq), used 8 g day dosing humans
in 1930s halving mortality bacterial pneumonias, shown cure
bird malaria 1940s also reported treatment human malaria
cases. describe synthesis heaq novel stereoisomer
hydroxyethylapoquinidine (heaqd) along two intermediates,
hydroxyethylquinine (heq) hydroxyethylquinidine (heqd), demonstrate
comparable elevated antimalarial 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50) 100 
to 200 nm plasmodium falciparum quinine-sensitive strain 3d7 (ic50, 56
nm). heaqd demonstrated activity quinine-tolerant p. falciparum
strains dd2 indo ic50s 300 700 nm. heqd activity 
dd2 ic50 313 nm. lethal mouse malaria model plasmodium berghei 
anka, heqd activity 20 mg/kg body weight comparable the
parent quinine quinidine drugs measured parasite inhibition 30-day
survival. addition, heq, heqd, heaq (ic50 ≥ 90 μm) little human
ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg) channel inhibition expressed cho cells
compared heaqd, quinine, quinidine (herg ic50s 27, 42, 4 μm,
respectively). heqd closely resembled quinine vitro vivo for
plasmodium inhibition demonstrated little herg channel inhibition, suggesting
that optimization preclinical studies warranted this
molecule.
