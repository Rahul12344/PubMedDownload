sexual differentiation malaria parasites gametocytes vertebrate
host subsequent gamete fertilization mosquitoes essential the
spreading disease. molecular processes orchestrating transitions
are far fully understood. here, report first transcriptome analysis
of male female plasmodium falciparum gametocytes coupled comprehensive
proteome analysis. male gametocytes enrichment proteins
involved formation flagellated gametes; proteins involved dna
replication, chromatin organization axoneme formation. hand,
female gametocytes enriched proteins required zygote formation and
functions fertilization; protein-, lipid- energy-metabolism.
integration transcriptome proteome data revealed 512 highly expressed
maternal transcripts without corresponding protein expression indicating large
scale translational repression p. falciparum female gametocytes first 
time. despite high degree conservation plasmodium species, 260 of
these 'repressed transcripts' previously described. moreover, for
some genes, protein expression reported oocysts and
sporozoites indicating repressed transcripts partitioned short- 
and long-term storage. finally, data sets provide essential resource for
identification vaccine/drug targets mechanistic studies.
