cytoadhesion plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes host
microvasculature key virulence determinant. parasite binding mediated 
a large family clonally variant adhesion proteins, termed p. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), encoded var genes expressed at
the infected erythrocyte surface. although pfemp1 proteins extensively
diverged opposing selection pressure maintain ligand binding while
avoiding antibody-mediated detection, recent work revealed be
classified different groups based chromosome location domain
composition. grouping reflects functional specialization pfemp1 proteins 
for different human host microvascular binding niches appears be
maintained gene recombination hierarchies. inone extreme, specific pfemp1
variant associated placental binding malaria pregnancy, 
other pfemp1 subtypes appear specialized infection malaria naïve
hosts. here, discuss recent findings origins evolution var
gene family, structure-function pfemp1 proteins, distinct subset 
pfemp1 variants associated severe childhood malaria.
