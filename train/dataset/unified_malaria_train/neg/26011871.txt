the effects cell asynchrony gene expression levels: analysis and
application plasmodium falciparum.

zhao w, dauwels j, cao j.

to investigate intraerythrocytic developmental cycle plasmodium
falciparum, time-series gene expression data commonly measured infected red
blood cells. however, observed data usually blurred due cell
asynchrony experiments. paper, effect cell asynchrony is
investigated conducting numerical experiments. simulation results suggest 
that cell asynchrony varying effects different intrinsic expression
patterns. specifically, intrinsic patterns high expression around the
late life stage likely affected cell asynchrony. also
investigated effect cell asynchrony depends experimental
conditions. analysis, burst rate r% infection period the
standard deviation Ïƒ growth rate identified strong impact the
blurring due cell asynchrony. consequently, important measure these
two parameters biological experiments order deblur time-series gene 
expression data.
