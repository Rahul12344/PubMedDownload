background: americas last continent colonized humans carrying
malaria parasites. plasmodium falciparum new world shows little
genetic diversity greater linkage disequilibrium, compared african
counterparts, clearly subdivided local, highly divergent populations.
however, limited available data revealed extensive genetic diversity in
american populations another major human malaria parasite, p. vivax.
methods: used improved sample preparation strategy next-generation
sequencing characterize 9 high-quality p. vivax genome sequences from
northwestern brazil. new data compared publicly available
sequences recently sampled clinical p. vivax isolates brazil (bra,
total n = 11 sequences), peru (per, n = 23), colombia (col, n = 31), mexico
(mex, n = 19).
principal findings/conclusions: found new world populations p. vivax
are diverse (nucleotide diversity π 5.2 × 10-4 6.2 × 10-4) p.
vivax populations southeast asia, malaria transmission is
substantially intense. display several non-synonymous nucleotide
substitutions (some previously undescribed) genes known suspected
to involved antimalarial drug resistance, dhfr, dhps, mdr1, mrp1,
and mrp-2, chloroquine resistance transporter ortholog (crt-o)
gene. moreover, p. vivax americas much less geographically
substructured local p. falciparum populations, relatively little
between-population genome-wide differentiation (pairwise fst values ranging
between 0.025 0.092). finally, p. vivax populations show rapid decline in
linkage disequilibrium increasing distance pairs polymorphic
sites, consistent frequent outcrossing. hypothesize high
diversity present-day p. vivax lineages americas originated from
successive migratory waves subsequent admixture parasite lineages
from geographically diverse sites. genome-wide analyses required to
test demographic scenario suggested data.
