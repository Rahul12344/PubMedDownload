cell biological analysis mosquito midgut invasion: defensive role the
actin-based ookinete hood.

schlegelmilch t, vlachou d.

successful completion plasmodium lifecycle mosquito vector is
critical malaria transmission. documented fate of
plasmodium mosquito ultimately depends fine interplay molecular
mosquito factors act parasite agonists antagonists. we
investigate whether cellular responses invaded midgut epithelium can
also determine parasite fate development. show parasite hood,
an actin-rich structure formed around ookinete exits epithelium, is
a local epithelial defence reaction observed around 60% invading parasites.
the hood co-localizes wasp, promoter actin filament nucleation,
suggesting active reaction invaded cell invading
parasites. importantly, depletion wasp rnai leads significant
reduction hood formation, consistent previously documented
role gene potent parasite antagonist. indeed, mosquitoes are
either genetically selected manipulated rnai refractory to
plasmodium, dead parasites exhibit actin hood. mosquitoes,
invading ookinetes killed lysis melanization exiting midgut
epithelium. silencing wasp mosquitoes inhibits formation hood
and allows many parasites develop oocysts. data conjunction with
fine microscopic observations suggest presence hood linked 
ookinete killing lysis.
