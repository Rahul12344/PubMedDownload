motivation: large-scale rna expression measurements generating enormous
quantities data. last two decades, many methods developed 
extracting insights regarding interrelationships genes such
data. mathematical computational perspectives underlie methods
are usually algebraic probabilistic.
results: here, introduce unexplored geometric view point expression
levels genes multiple experiments interpreted vectors a
high-dimensional space. specifically, find, expression profile each
particular gene, approximation linear combination profiles few
other genes. method inspired recent developments realm of
compressed sensing machine learning domain. demonstrate power of
our approach extracting valuable information expression data, we
independently applied large-scale experiments carried yeast 
malaria parasite whole transcriptomes. parameters extracted sparse
reconstruction expression profiles, fed supervised learning
platform, used successfully predict relationships genes
throughout gene ontology hierarchy protein-protein interaction map.
extensive assessment biological results shows high accuracy both
recovering known predictions yielding accurate predictions missing from
the current databases. suggest geometrical approach presented is
suitable broad range high-dimensional experimental data.
