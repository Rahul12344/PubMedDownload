background: submicroscopic malaria infections contribute malaria transmission.
describing extent parasite reservoir importance. people
living human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), frequency subpatent
malaria infections rarely reported. aim present study to
determine frequency submicroscopic infections people living hiv in
gabon relationship cotrimoxazole (ctx) use.
methods: survey conducted two health care centres rural areas
(koulamoutou oyem) three urban areas (libreville) gabon march 
2015 june 2016. blood samples collected consenting people living
with hiv negative blood smear. information ctx antiretroviral
therapy intake recorded medical file patient an
interview. molecular analysis, plasmodium small subunit ribosomal rna
gene amplified nested polymerase chain reaction.
results: submicroscopic infections detected 10.1% (n=12/119) the
people living hiv, frequently residing rural areas (15.1%) 
compared urban areas (2.1%) (p<0.01). proportion anaemic patients was
1.74-fold frequent malaria-infected patients, although statistically 
significant. submicroscopic infections frequency vary according ctx
intake (p=0.6).
conclusions: present pilot study highlights non-negligible frequency of
submicroscopic malaria infections people living hiv rural areas, but
no relationship ctx intake found.
