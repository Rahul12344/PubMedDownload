two major obstacles successful cancer treatment toxicity of
cytostatics development drug resistance cancer cells during
chemotherapy. acquired intrinsic drug resistance responsible almost 90%
of treatment failure. reason, urgent need new anticancer
drugs improved efficacy cancer cells, less toxicity on
normal cells. impressive examples demonstrating success natural 
plant compounds fight cancer, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and
anthracyclines. artesunic acid (arta), drug malaria treatment, also exerts 
cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells. multidrug resistance often results 
drug efflux pumps (abc-transporters) reduce intracellular drug levels.
hence, would interesting know, whether arta could overcome drug
resistance tumor cells, way abc-transporters involved.
different derivatives showing improved features concerning cytotoxicity and
pharmacokinetic behavior developed. considering drug sensitivity
and resistance, chose sensitive doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cell
line determined killing effect arta cells. molecular docking 
and doxorubicin efflux assays performed investigate interaction of
the derivatives p-glycoprotein. using single-cell gel electrophoresis
(alkaline comet assay), showed derivatives arta induce dna
breakage accordingly programmed cell death, represents promising
strategy cancer treatment. arta activated apoptosis cancer cells the
iron-mediated generation reactive oxygen species (ros). conclusion, arta
derivatives may bear potential developed anticancer drugs.
