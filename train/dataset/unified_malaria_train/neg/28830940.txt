our knowledge cell cycle regulatory mechanisms apicomplexan parasites is
very limited. study, describe novel toxoplasma gondii factor that
has vital role chromosome replication regulation cytoplasmic 
nuclear mitotic structures, named factor ecr1 essential for
chromosome replication 1. ecr1 discovered complementation a
temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant suffers lethal, uncontrolled chromosome
replication 40°c similar ts mutant carrying defect topoisomerase.
ecr1 52-kda protein containing divergent ring traf-sina-like zinc
binding domains dynamically expressed tachyzoite cell cycle. ecr1
first appears unique spindle compartment apicomplexa (centrocone)
of nuclear envelope early phase nucleus late phase 
where reaches maximum expression. following nuclear division, before
daughter parasites separate mother parasite, ecr1 downregulated and
is absent new daughter parasites. proteomics ecr1 identified
interactions ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation machinery the
minichromosome maintenance complex, loss ecr1 led increased
stability key member complex, mcm2. ecr1 also forms stable complex
with cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-related kinase, tgondii crk5 (tgcrk5),
which displays similar cell cycle expression localization tachyzoite
replication. importantly, localization ecr1/tgcrk5 centrocone
indicates apicomplexa-specific spindle compartment houses important
regulatory factors control parasite cell cycle.importance parasites of
the apicomplexan family important causes human disease, including malaria,
toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis. parasite growth underlying cause 
pathogenesis, yet despite importance, molecular basis parasite
replication poorly understood. filling knowledge gap cannot be
accomplished mining recent whole-genome sequencing data apicomplexan
cell cycles differ substantially lack many key regulatory factors of
well-studied yeast mammalian cell division models. utilized forward
genetics discover essential factors regulate cell division these
parasites using toxoplasma gondii model. example approach is
described discovery putative e3 ligase/protein kinase
mechanism involved regulating chromosome replication mitotic processes 
asexual stage parasites.
