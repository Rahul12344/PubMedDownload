plasmodium knowlesi, malaria parasite originally thought restricted to
macaques southeast asia, recently recognized significant cause
of human malaria. unlike benign morphologically similar p. malariae,
these parasites lead fatal infections. malaria parasites, including p.
knowlesi, yet detected macaques kapit division of
malaysian borneo, majority human knowlesi malaria cases been
reported. order extend understanding epidemiology and
evolutionary history p. knowlesi, examined 108 wild macaques malaria
parasites sequenced circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene mitochondrial
(mt) dna p. knowlesi isolates derived macaques humans. detected
five species plasmodium (p. knowlesi, p. inui, p. cynomolgi, p. fieldi p. 
coatneyi) long-tailed pig-tailed macaques, extremely high
prevalence p. inui p. knowlesi. macaques higher number p.
knowlesi genotypes per infection humans, diverse alleles p. 
knowlesi csp gene certain mtdna haplotypes shared hosts.
analyses dna sequence data indicate mtdna lineages
associated exclusively either host. furthermore, analyses mtdna
data reveal p. knowlesi derived ancestral parasite population
that existed prior human settlement southeast asia, underwent
significant population expansion approximately 30,000-40,000 years ago. our
results indicate human infections p. knowlesi newly emergent in
southeast asia knowlesi malaria primarily zoonosis wild
macaques reservoir hosts. however, ongoing ecological changes resulting
from deforestation, associated increase human population, could
enable pathogenic species plasmodium switch humans preferred
host.
