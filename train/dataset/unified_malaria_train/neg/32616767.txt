human malaria parasites complex poorly understood population dynamics
inside human host. infections, parasites progress
synchronously 48 h lifecycle following erythrocyte invasion, such
that one time limited spread parasites particular time 
(hours) post-invasion. patients presenting older parasites, with
asynchronous infections, reported higher risks fatal
outcomes, associated higher parasite biomass multiplication rates
respectively. however, practical tools assess synchrony estimate parasite 
age post-invasion patient samples lacking. developed novel
method based three genes differentially expressed parasite
intra-erythrocytic lifecycle, applied samples patients with
uncomplicated malaria attending two health clinics ghana. found most
patients presented synchronous infections, parasites within 12 h of
erythrocyte invasion. finally investigated clinical features fever 
and parasite density could act predictors parasite age synchrony. the
new method simple practicable approach study parasite dynamics in
naturally-infected patients, significant improvement subjective
microscopical methods parasite staging vivo, aiding patient management.
