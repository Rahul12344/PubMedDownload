the poorly understood mechanisms dry season persistence anopheles spp.
mosquitoes dry season africa remain critical gap our
knowledge plasmodium disease transmission. thought adult
mosquitoes remain dormant state throughout seven-month dry season, 
nature state remains unknown largely recapitulated in
laboratory settings. elucidate possible connections state with
microbial composition, whole body microbiomes adult mosquitoes dry 
and wet seasons two locations mali varying water availability were
compared sequencing 16s ribosomal rna gene. locations village
near niger river year-round water sources (n'gabakoro, "riparian"), 
a typical sahelian area highly seasonal breeding sites (thierola area,
"sahelian"). 16s bacterial data consisted 2057 sequence variants 426
genera across 184 families. data, found several compositional
differences seasonally spatially linked. counter initial
hypothesis, pronounced seasonal differences bacterial
microbiome riparian, rather sahelian areas. seasonal shifts were
primarily ralstonia, sphingorhabdus, duganella spp. bacteria are
usually soil water-associated, indicating changes may bacteria 
acquired larval environment, rather adulthood. sahelian dry season
mosquitoes, unique intracellular bacteria, anaplasma, likely
was acquired non-human blood feeding. cytochrome b analysis blood
meals showed greater heterogeneity host choice an. coluzzii independent 
season thierola area compared n'gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin 
blood meal, respectively), indicating relaxation anthropophily. overall,
this exploratory study provides valuable indications spatial seasonal
differences bacterial composition help refine difficult study
