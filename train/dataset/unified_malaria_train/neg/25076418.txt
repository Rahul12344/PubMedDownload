summary erythrocytes extensively remodelled malaria parasite following
invasion cell. plasmodium falciparum encodes numerous virulence-associated
and host-cell remodelling proteins trafficked cytoplasm, cell
membrane surface infected erythrocyte. export soluble
proteins relies sequence directing entry secretory pathways in
addition export signal. export signal consisting five amino acids is
termed plasmodium export element (pexel) vacuole transport signal
(vts). genome mining studies revealed pexel/vts carrying protein
families expanded dramatically p. falciparum compared malaria 
parasite species, possibly due lineage-specific expansion linked unique
requirements p. falciparum host-cell remodelling. functional
characterization genes gene families may reveal potential drug
targets could inhibit protein trafficking infected erythrocytes. this
review highlights recent advances key knowledge gaps protein
trafficking pathways p. falciparum-infected red cells speculates the
impact exported gene families trafficking pathway.
