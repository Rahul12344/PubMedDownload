atomic force microscopy image analysis energy dispersive x-ray diffraction
experiments used investigate structural organization cationic
nanoemulsion/oligonucleotide complexes. oligonucleotides targeting topoisomerase 
ii gene adsorbed cationic nanoemulsions obtained means spontaneous 
emulsification procedure. topographical analysis atomic force microscopy
allowed observation nanoemulsion/oligonucleotide complexes through
three-dimensional high-resolution images. flattening oil droplets was
observed, reduced complexes obtained high amount adsorbed 
oligonucleotides. conditions, complexes exhibit droplet size 600nm
range. oligonucleotides molecules detected surface the
droplets, preventing fusion aggregation. lamellar structure
organization identified energy dispersive x-ray diffraction experiments.
the presence nucleic acid molecules led disorganization lipid 
arrangement expansion lattice spacing, proportional to
the amount oligonucleotides added.
