background: tissue-specific promoters controlling expression transgenes in
anopheles mosquitoes represent valuable tool studying interaction 
between malaria vectors plasmodium parasites transmit 
novel malaria control strategies based developing plasmodium-refractory
mosquitoes expressing anti-parasitic genes. aim studied 
promoter regions two genes important malaria vector, anopheles
gambiae, whose expression strongly induced upon blood feeding.
results: analysed a. gambiae antryp1 g12 genes, shown to
be midgut-specific maximally expressed 24 hours post-bloodmeal (pbm).
antryp1, required bloodmeal digestion, encodes one member family 7
trypsin genes. g12 gene, unknown function, previously identified in
our laboratory screen genes induced response bloodmeal. fused
1.1 kb upstream regions containing putative promoter genes to
reporter genes transformed indian malaria vector a. stephensi 
to see could recapitulate expression pattern endogenous genes.
both antryp1 g12 upstream regions able drive female-predominant, 
midgut-specific expression transgenic mosquitoes. expression the
antryp1-driven reporter transgenic a. stephensi lines low, undetectable by
northern blot analysis, failed fully match induction kinetics the
endogenous antryp1 gene a. gambiae. incomplete conservation expression
suggests either subtle differences transcriptional machinery a.
stephensi a. gambiae upstream region chosen lacked the
control elements. contrast, g12 upstream region able faithfully
reproduce expression profile endogenous a. gambiae gene, showing
female midgut specificity adult mosquito massive induction pbm,
peaking 24 hours.
conclusions: studies two putative blood-meal induced, midgut-specific
promoters validate use g12 upstream regulatory regions drive targeted
transgene expression coinciding spatially temporally pre-sporogonic
stages plasmodium parasites mosquito, offering possibility of
manipulating vector competence performing functional studies on
vector-parasite interactions.
