analysis genome sequences 159 isolates plasmodium falciparum from
senegal yields extraordinarily high proportion (26.85%) protein-coding
genes ratio nonsynonymous synonymous polymorphism greater than
one. proportion much greater observed organisms. also
unusual site-frequency spectra synonymous nonsynonymous
polymorphisms virtually indistinguishable. hypothesized the
complicated life cycle malaria parasites might lead qualitatively different
population genetics predicted classical wright-fisher (wf)
model, assumes single random-mating population finite constant
population size organism nonoverlapping generations. paper
summarizes simulation studies random genetic drift selection malaria
parasites take account unusual life history. results show
that random genetic drift malaria life cycle pronounced under
the wf model. paradoxically, efficiency purifying selection malaria
life cycle also greater wf, relative efficiency positive
selection varies according conditions. additionally, site-frequency
spectrum neutrality also skewed toward low-frequency alleles than
expected wf. results highlight importance considering the
malaria life cycle applying existing population genetic tools based the
wf model. caveat applies species similarly complex life
cycles.
