background: plasmodium falciparum resistance anti-malarial drugs remains a
major obstacle control malaria. 2001 tanzania replaced chloroquine
(cq) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) first-line drug, turn was
replaced artemisinin combination therapy 2006. sp however, continued to
be used intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy (iptp)
despite reports high levels resistance sp due lack of
alternatives sp iptp. recent reports indicated recovery of
cq-susceptibility malawi, kenya, mozambique, tanzania based the
prevalence wild types codon 76 pfcrt gene indigenous p.
falciparum populations. current prevalence pfcrt-76 cq resistance
marker six regions tanzania mainland hereby reported.
methods: dna extracted filter-paper dried blood spots rapid diagnostics 
kit strips collected finger-prick blood used genotype pfcrt-76
resistance marker using pcr-rflp. data previously published studies were
used generate cq susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression
model.
results: seven hundred forty one (741) samples genotyped. current
frequency cq-susceptible pfcrt-k76 92% differ
between regions tanzania (χ(2) = 2.37; p = 0.795). k76 allelic prevalence 
was 85.7 93% regions (χ(2) = 7.88, p = 0.163). cq resistance
recovery trends showed regional variability may caused differences 
malaria transmission intensity, overall trends converge the
susceptibility levels regions approach >90%.
conclusions: cq withdrawal tanzania resulted >90% recovery of
susceptibility ten years withdrawal. findings support the
search cq-based combination drugs possible future alternative sp 
iptp places full recovery cq-susceptibility evident.
