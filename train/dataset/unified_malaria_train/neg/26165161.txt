the insulin-like peptides (ilps) respective signaling regulatory
pathways highly conserved across phyla. invertebrates, ilps regulate
diverse physiological processes, including metabolism, reproduction, behavior,
and immunity. previously reported blood feeding alone induced minimal
changes ilp expression anopheles stephensi. however, ingestion blood
meal containing human insulin plasmodium falciparum, mimic insulin
signaling, leads significant increases ilp expression head and
midgut, suggesting potential role asilps regulation p. falciparum
sporogonic development. here, show soluble p. falciparum products, but
not lps zymosan, directly induced asilp expression immortalized a.
stephensi cells vitro. further, asilp expression dependent signaling 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(mek/erk) phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (pi3k)/akt branches the
insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (iis) pathway. inhibition p.
falciparum-induced ilps vivo decreased parasite development through
kinetically distinct effects mosquito innate immune responses. specifically,
knockdown asilp4 induced early expression immune effector genes (1-6 h
after infection), pattern associated significantly reduced parasite
abundance prior invasion midgut epithelium. contrast, knockdown of
asilp3 increased later expression genes (24 h infection), a
pattern associated significantly reduced oocyst development. 
data suggest p. falciparum parasites alter expression mosquito asilps
to dampen immune response facilitate development mosquito
vector.
