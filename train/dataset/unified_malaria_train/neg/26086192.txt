malaria remains one leading causes death worldwide, despite decades 
public health efforts. recent commitment many endemic countries to
eliminate malaria marks shift away programs aimed controlling disease
burden towards one emphasizes reducing transmission virulent
human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum. gametocytes, only
developmental stage malaria parasites able infect mosquitoes, remained
understudied, occur low numbers, cause disease, are
difficult detect vivo conventional methods. here, review the
transmission biology p. falciparum gametocytes, featuring important recent
discoveries genes affecting parasite commitment gametocyte formation,
microvesicles enabling parasites communicate other, the
anatomical site immature gametocytes develop. propose potential parasite
targets future intervention highlight remaining knowledge gaps.
