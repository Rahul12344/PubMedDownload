y chromosome function, structure evolution poorly understood many
species, including anopheles genus mosquitoes-an emerging model system for
studying speciation also represents major vectors malaria. 
anopheline previously implicated male mating behavior, recent data 
from anopheles gambiae complex suggests that, apart putative primary
sex-determiner, genes conserved y. studying functional
basis evolutionary divergence chromosome gambiae complex
is complicated complete f1 male hybrid sterility. here, used f1 × f0
crossing scheme overcome severe bottleneck male hybrid incompatibilities 
that enabled us experimentally purify genetically labeled a. gambiae y
chromosome a. arabiensis background. whole genome sequencing (wgs)
confirmed a. gambiae retained original sequence content a. 
arabiensis genomic background. contrast comparable experiments in
drosophila, find presence heterospecific chromosome no
significant effect expression a. arabiensis genes, transcriptional 
differences explained almost exclusively direct consequence of
transcripts arising sequence elements present a. gambiae chromosome
itself. find hybrids show obvious fertility defects, no
substantial reduction male competitiveness. results demonstrate that,
despite radically different structure, chromosomes two species
of gambiae complex diverged estimated 1.85 mya function
interchangeably, thus indicating chromosome harbor loci
contributing hybrid incompatibility. therefore, chromosome gene flow between
members gambiae complex possible even current level of
divergence. importantly, also suggests malaria control interventions
based sex-distorting drive would transferable, whether intentionally or
contingent, major malaria vector species.
