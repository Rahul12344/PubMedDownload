background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency exhibits
considerable allelic heterogeneity manifests variable biochemical 
clinical penetrance. long thought g6pd deficiency confers
partial protection severe malaria, however prior genetic association
studies disagreed regard strength specificity a
protective effect, might reflect differences host genetic
background, environmental influences, specific clinical phenotypes
considered.
methods: case-control association study severe malaria conducted 
gambia, region west africa considerable allelic heterogeneity
underlying expression g6pd deficiency trait, evaluating three major
nonsynonymous polymorphisms known associated enzyme deficiency (a968g,
t542a, c202t) cohort 3836 controls 2379 severe malaria cases.
results: deficiency allele exhibited similar trend toward protection
against severe malaria overall (15-26% reduced risk); however, stratifying
severe malaria two constituent clinical subphenotypes, severe malarial 
anaemia (sma) cerebral malaria (cm), three deficiency alleles exhibited
trends opposing effect, risk conferred sma protection respect
to cm. assess overall effect g6pd deficiency trait, deficiency alleles 
found across three loci pooled. g6pd deficiency trait found be
significantly associated protection severe malaria overall (or 0.83
[0.75-0.92], p = 0.0006), limited cm (or 0.73 [0.61-0.87], p =
0.0005), trend toward increased risk sma, especially in
fully-deficient individuals (or 1.43 [0.99-2.08], p = 0.056). sex-stratified
testing largely comported results, evidence suggesting that
protection g6pd deficiency trait conferred males females,
though susceptibility sma may restricted fully-deficient male
hemizygotes.
conclusions: part africa multiple alleles contribute expression 
of g6pd deficiency trait, findings clarify extend previous work done in
populations single variant predominates, taken together suggest a
causal role g6pd deficiency trait respect severe malaria, with
opposing effects seen two major clinical subphenotypes.
