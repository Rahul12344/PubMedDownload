background: genetic diversity three important antigenic proteins, namely
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (trap), apical membrane antigen 1
(ama1), 6-cysteine protein (p48/45), found various
developmental stages plasmodium parasites crucial targeted vaccine
development. studies related genetic diversity proteins are
available plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax, barely enough
information exists regarding plasmodium malariae. present study aims to
demonstrate genetic variations existing among three genes p.
malariae analysing diversity nucleotide protein levels.
methods: three surface protein genes isolated 45 samples collected in
thailand (n = 33), myanmar (n = 8), lao pdr (n = 4), using conventional
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. then, pcr products sequenced 
analysed using bioedit, mega6, dnasp programs.
results: average pairwise nucleotide diversities (π) p. malariae trap,
ama1, p48/45 0.00169, 0.00413, 0.00029, respectively. haplotype 
diversities (hd) p. malariae trap, ama1, p48/45 0.919, 0.946, and
0.130, respectively. nucleotide substitutions non-synonymous,
which indicated genetic variations genes maintained by
positive diversifying selection, thus, suggesting role potential
target protective immune response. amino acid substitutions p. malariae
trap, ama1, p48/45 could categorized 17, 20, 2 unique amino-acid
variants, respectively. vaccine development, carboxyl terminal of
p48/45 would good candidate according conserved amino acid low genetic
diversity (π = 0.2-0.3).
conclusions: high mutational diversity observed p. malariae trap ama1 
as compared p48/45 p. malariae samples isolated thailand, myanmar, and
lao pdr. taken together, results suggest p48/45 might good
vaccine candidate p. malariae infection sufficiently low
genetic diversity highly conserved amino acids especially carboxyl
end.
