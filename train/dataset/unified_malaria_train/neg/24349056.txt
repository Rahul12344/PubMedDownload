the risk factors cerebral malaria (cm) wide variation clinical

patients. present study, hypothesized subset malaria
patients, cm susceptibility associated variation cxcl10 expression. we
determined whether polymorphisms cxcl10 gene promoter region played role
in clinical status malaria patients addressed genetic basis of
cxcl10 expression malaria infection. following extensive bioinformatics
analyses, two reported single nucleotide polymorphisms cxcl10 promoter
(-135g>a [rs56061981] -1447a>g [rs4508917]) identified among 66 cm and
69 non-cm indian patients using pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism
assay. individuals -1447(a/g) genotype susceptible cm (adjusted 
odds ratio [aor] = 2.60, 95% ci = 1.51-5.85, p = 0.021). addition, individuals
with -1447(a/g) genotype significantly higher plasma cxcl10 levels than
individuals -1447(a/a) genotype. stratifying patients according to
gender, observed association cm expression cxcl10 more
pronounced males female patients (aor = 5.47, 95% ci = 1.34-22.29,
p = 0.018). furthermore, -135g>a polymorphism conferred decreased risk cm
among males (aor = 0.19, 95% ci = 0.05-0.78, p = 0.021). polymorphisms the
cxcl10 gene promoter sequence associated increased cxcl10 production,
which linked severity cm. results suggest -1447a>g
polymorphism cxcl10 gene promoter could partly responsible reported
variation underlying severity cm outcomes particularly males.
