the plasmodial surface anion channel mediates uptake nutrients other
solutes erythrocytes infected malaria parasites. clag3 genes p. 
falciparum determine channel's activity human malaria, the
encoded proteins contribute transport unknown. here, used proteases to
examine channel's composition function. proteases distinct
specificities cleaved within extracellular domain clag3, produced 
differing degrees transport inhibition. chymotrypsin-induced inhibition
depended parasite genotype, channels induced hb3 parasite affected
to greater extent dd2 clone. inheritance functional
proteolysis hb3Ã—dd2 genetic cross, dna transfection, gene silencing
experiments pointed clag3 genes, providing independent evidence 
role genes. protease protection assays dd2-specific inhibitor and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed variant l1115f residue clag3
extracellular loop contributes inhibitor binding accounts differences 
in functional proteolysis. findings indicate surface-exposed clag3 
the relevant pool protein channel function. also suggest
structural models exposed clag3 domains contribute pore formation 
parasite nutrient uptake.
