leptin, pleiotropic protein long recognized play important role 
in regulation energy homeostasis, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and
other physiological functions effects central nervous system
(cns) peripheral tissues. leptin secreted adipose tissue encoded by
the obese (ob) gene. leptin acts central mediator regulates immunity
as well nutrition. importantly, leptin modulate innate adaptive
immune responses. leptin deficiency/resistance associated dysregulation
of cytokine production, increased susceptibility toward infectious diseases,
autoimmune disorders, malnutrition inflammatory responses. malnutrition
induces state immunodeficiency inclination death communicable
diseases. infectious diseases disease poor invariably suffer 
malnutrition could result reduced serum leptin levels. thus, leptin has
been placed center many interrelated functions various pathogenic
conditions, bacterial, viruses parasitic infections. review
herein, recent advances role leptin malnutrition pathogenesis
of infectious diseases particular emphasis parasitic diseases as
leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, amoebiasis, malaria.
