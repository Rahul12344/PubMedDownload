by 2050 civilized planet may comprised predominantly networked
megacities embedded warm subtropical tropical climates, stress
from climate change catastrophic weather events. urban slum areas these
cities, including found wealthier middle- high-income nations (blue 
marble health), especially vulnerable disease. moreover, regional
conflicts fought shifting limited resources, including water, will
collapse health systems infrastructures promote disease emergence 
reemergence. thus 2050 might congratulate successfully 
eliminating key parasitic neglected tropical diseases as
dracunculiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, human african
trypanosomiasis, could commensurate rise parasitic diseases
based scenarios highlighted above. particular concern urban and
newly urbanized helminth infections, including schistosomiasis some
soil-transmitted helminth infections, well zoonotic helminthiases, as
toxocariasis, food-borne trematodiases, cysticercosis. protozoan infections
persisting urban environments, including leishmaniasis, chagas disease,
malaria, intestinal protozoan infections, also remain, zoonotic 
diseases toxoplasmosis. best hope counteract parasitic
diseases emerging steaming 21st century megacities develop new and
innovative technologies gene editing, systems biology, immunology,
and new single-celled omics. however, success front require 
ability contain globalization antiscience beliefs sentiments.
