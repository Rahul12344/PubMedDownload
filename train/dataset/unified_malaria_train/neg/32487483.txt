background: cd36 multifunctional receptor cells plays role in
important cellular processes including immune regulation. evidence indicates that
mutations cd36 gene associated malaria. moreover, studies 
frequency cd36 deficiency conducted specific provinces china. 
however, frequency cd36 deficiency may differ among various ethnic
populations. study, analyzed frequency cd36 deficiency among
seven different provinces minorities china.
methods materials: study, 5313 samples randomly collected from
seven provinces china. cd36 deficiency platelets monocytes was
determined via flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody (mab) cd36. dna
sequencing analysis performed identify mutations associated cd36
deficiency.
results: frequency cd36 deficiency among individuals different
provinces (n = 7) 1.60%, comprising 0.38% type-i deficiency 1.22% of
type-ii deficiency. distribution among provinces ranged 0.81% 1.99%. 
the largest ethnic group, han, showed lower frequency deficiency ethnic
minorities (1.30% versus 2.37%). common mutations found overall
cohort 329-330delac 1228-1239delattgtgcctatt. significant high
frequencies cd36 deficiency detected two ethnic minorities, zhuang
(3.69%) buyi (3.05%), living southern china.
conclusions: analysis large cohort, determined frequencies
of cd36 deficiency among different chinese ethnic groups. high frequency of
type-i deficiency found certain minorities living southern china, which
is known vulnerable malaria epidemics. findings may help us
understand phenotypic consequences cd36-deficient alleles associated 
malaria.
