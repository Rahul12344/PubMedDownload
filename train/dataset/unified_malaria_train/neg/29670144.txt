the chromobacterium sp. panama bacterium vivo vitro anti-plasmodium
properties. assess nature chromobacterium-produced anti-plasmodium 
factors, chemical partition conducted bioassay-guided fractionation 
different fractions assayed activity asexual stages p.
falciparum. isolated compounds partitioned reversed-phase
fplc followed size-exclusion chromatography; high resolution uplc esi/ms
data collected revealed active fraction contained a
cyclic depsipeptide, identified romidepsin. pure sample this
fda-approved hdac inhibitor allowed us independently verify finding, 
establish romidepsin also potent effect mosquito stages the
parasite's life cycle. genomic comparisons c. sp. panama multiple
species within chromobacterium genus demonstrated correlation
between presence gene cluster responsible romidepsin production and
effective antiplasmodial activity. romidepsin-null chromobacterium spp. mutant 
loses anti-plasmodium properties losing ability inhibit p.
falciparum hdac activity, romidepsin active resistant parasites to
commonly deployed antimalarials. independent mode action substantiates
exploring chromobacteria-based approach malaria transmission-blocking.
