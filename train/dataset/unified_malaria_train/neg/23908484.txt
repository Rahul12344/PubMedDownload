background: major impediments development vaccines drugs plasmodium
vivax malaria inability culture species extreme
difficulty undertaking clinical research experimental infection.
methods: parasite bank collected 49-year-old woman p. vivax
infection, characterized, used experimental infection study.
results: donor made full recovery malaria collection a
parasite bank, tested negative agents screened blood donations. 
dna sequence analysis isolate indicated clonal. two subjects
inoculated isolate became polymerase chain reaction positive days 8
and 9, onset symptoms positive blood smears day 14, were
treated artemether-lumefantrine, rapid clinical parasitologic
response. transcripts parasite gene pvs25 expressed in
gametocytes, life cycle stage infectious mosquitoes, first detected
on days 11 12.
conclusions: experimental system results vivo parasite growth,
probably infectious mosquitoes. offers opportunity undertake studies
previously impossible p. vivax facilitate better understanding 
the pathology vivax malaria development antimalarial drugs and
vaccines. trial registration. anzctr: 12612001096842.
