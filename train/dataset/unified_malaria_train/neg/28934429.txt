cerebral malaria, reversible encephalopathy affecting young children, a
medical emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment treatment. we
performed whole-transcriptomic analysis blood samples malian children
with cerebral uncomplicated malaria. focused transcripts pathways
for dysfunction associated neurodegenerative disorders. we
found snca, siah2, ubb, hspa1a, tubb2a, pink1 upregulated
(fold-increases, ≥2.6), whereas ubd psmc5 downregulated (fold-decreases,
≤4.39) children cerebral malaria, compared uncomplicated 
malaria. findings provide first evidence pathogenic mechanisms
common human cerebral malaria neurodegenerative disorders.
