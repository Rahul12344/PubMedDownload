the plasmodium falciparum parasite's ability adapt environmental pressures,
such human immune system antimalarial drugs, makes malaria enduring
burden public health. understanding genetic basis adaptations 
critical intervening successfully malaria. end, created a
high-density genotyping array assays 17,000 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (âˆ¼ 1 snp/kb), applied 57 culture-adapted parasites from
three continents. characterized genome-wide genetic diversity within and
between populations identified numerous loci signals natural
selection, suggesting role recent adaptation. addition, performed 
a genome-wide association study (gwas), searching loci correlated with
resistance thirteen antimalarials; detected known novel resistance
loci, including new halofantrine resistance locus, pf10_0355. through
functional testing demonstrated pf10_0355 overexpression decreases
sensitivity halofantrine, mefloquine, lumefantrine, to
structurally unrelated antimalarials, increased gene copy number
mediates resistance. gwas follow-on functional validation demonstrate the
potential genome-wide studies elucidate functionally important loci 
malaria parasite genome.
