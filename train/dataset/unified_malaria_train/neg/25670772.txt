sarcocystis neurona member coccidia, clade single-celled
parasites medical veterinary importance including eimeria, sarcocystis,
neospora, toxoplasma. unlike eimeria, single-host enteric pathogen,
sarcocystis, neospora, toxoplasma two-host parasites infect and
produce infectious tissue cysts wide range intermediate hosts. a
genus, sarcocystis one successful protozoan parasites; all
vertebrates, including birds, reptiles, fish, mammals hosts least
one sarcocystis species. sequenced sarcocystis neurona, causal agent 
of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. s. neurona genome 127 mbp,
more twice size sequenced coccidian genomes. comparative
analyses identified conservation invasion machinery among coccidia.
however, many dense-granule rhoptry kinase genes, responsible altering
host effector pathways toxoplasma neospora, absent s. neurona.
further, s. neurona divergent repertoire srs proteins, previously
implicated tissue cyst formation toxoplasma. systems-based analyses
identified series metabolic innovations, including ability exploit
alternative sources energy. finally, present s. neurona model detailing 
conserved molecular innovations promote transition purely enteric
lifestyle (eimeria) heteroxenous parasite capable infecting wide range 
of intermediate hosts.importance: sarcocystis neurona member the
coccidia, clade single-celled apicomplexan parasites responsible major
economic health care burdens worldwide. cousin plasmodium,
cryptosporidium, theileria, eimeria, sarcocystis one most
successful parasite genera; capable infecting vertebrates (fish,
reptiles, birds, mammals-including humans). past decade witnessed 
increasing number human outbreaks clinical significance associated with
acute sarcocystosis. among sarcocystis species, s. neurona wide host range 
and causes fatal encephalitis horses, marine mammals, several other
mammals. provide insights transition purely enteric parasite
(e.g., eimeria) one forms tissue cysts (toxoplasma), present first
genome sequence s. neurona. comparisons coccidian genomes highlight
the molecular innovations drive distinct life cycle strategies.
