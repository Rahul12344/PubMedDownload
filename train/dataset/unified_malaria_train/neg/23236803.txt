objective: clone plasmodium vivax duffy binding protein critical functional 
region ii (pvdbpii) gene central china isolate, express identify
the recombinant pvdbpii protein vitro.
methods: pcr performed amplify pvdbpii p. vivax dna central
china isolate pcr product inserted pet28a(+) vector.
pet28a-pvdbpii recombinant plasmid constructed transformed e. coli
host bl21 (de3+). iptg used induce recombinant pvdbpii protein fused
with tag, protein purified his-nta affinity chromatography.
the recombinant protein identified sds-page western blot.
results: pcr product pvdbpii gene 1,1 kb, meeting the
expectation predicted fragment size. recombinant pet28a-pvdbpii plasmid
was verified sequencing insertion correct direction and
in frame, 4 non-synonymous mutations compared reference p. vivax
strain sal-i. sds-page, western blot analysis showed recombinant
pvdbpii protein 44 kda, could recognized pooled sera from
vivax malaria patients.
conclusion: pvdbpii gene central china isolate successfully cloned, and
recombinant pvdbpii expressed, thereby providing opportunity study
on pvdbpii.
