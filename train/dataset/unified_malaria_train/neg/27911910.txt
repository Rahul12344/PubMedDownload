experimental immunization radiation attenuated sporozoites (ras) and
genetically attenuated sporozoites proved promising approach for
malaria vaccine development. however, parasite biomarkers growth attenuation
and enhanced immune protection response radiation remain poorly understood.
here, report effect attenuating dose γ-irradiation (15 krad)
on plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (pfspz) ultrastructure electron
microscopy, growth rate liver stage p. falciparum liver cell cultures, 
genome-wide transcriptional profile liver stage parasites microarray. we
find γ-irradiation treated pfspz retained normal cellular structure except
that vacuous partially disrupted plasma membrane inner
membrane complex. similar infection rate observed γ-irradiation-treated 
and untreated pfspz human hco-4 liver cells (0.47% versus 0.49%, respectively)
on day 3 post-infection. microarray studies, cumulatively, 180 liver stage
parasite genes significantly transcriptionally altered day 3 and/or 6
post-infection. among transcriptionally altered biomarkers, identified a
signature seven candidate parasite genes associated functionally
diverse pathways may regulate radiation induced cell cycle arrest the
parasite within hepatocyte. repertoire 14 genes associated protein 
translation transcriptionally overexpressed within parasite radiation. 
additionally, 37 genes encode proteins expressed cell surface exported 
into host cell, 4 encode membrane associated transporters, 10 encode
proteins related misfolding stress-related protein processing. these
results significantly increased repertoire novel targets 1)
biomarkers safety define proper attenuation, 2) generating genetically
attenuated parasite vaccine candidates, 3) subunit candidate vaccines against
liver stage malaria.
