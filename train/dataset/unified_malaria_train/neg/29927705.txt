eukaryotic pathogens must survive different hosts, respond changing
environments, exploit specialized niches propagate. plasmodium parasites
cause human malaria bloodstream infections, must persist long
enough transmitted. parasites evolved diverse strategies variant
gene expression control critical biological processes blood-stage
infections, including antigenic variation, erythrocyte invasion, innate immune
evasion, nutrient acquisition, well life-cycle transitions. epigenetic 
mechanisms within parasite elucidated, discovery epigenomic
marks associated gene silencing activation, identification of
epigenetic regulators chromatin proteins required switching 
and maintenance gene expression. here, review key epigenetic processes 
that facilitate transition parasite life cycle epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms utilized plasmodium parasites survive changing
environments consider epigenetic switching context outcome of
human infections.
