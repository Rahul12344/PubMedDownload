background: mosquitoes exhibit 24 hr rhythms flight activity, feeding,
reproduction development. better understand molecular basis 
rhythms nocturnal malaria vector anopheles gambiae, utilized
microarray analysis time-of-day specific collections mosquitoes 48 hr 
to explore coregulation gene expression rhythms circadian clock and
light, compare 24 hr rhythmic gene expression diurnal
aedes aegypti dengue vector mosquito.
results: time courses an. gambiae head body collected under
light:dark cycle (ld) constant dark (dd) conditions, applied three
algorithms detect sinusoidal patterns algorithm detects spikes
in expression. revealed across four experimental conditions 393 probes newly
scored rhythmic. genes correspond functions metabolic
detoxification, immunity nutrient sensing. includes glutathione
s-transferase gste5, whose expression pattern chromosomal location shared
with genes, suggesting shared chromosomal regulation; pulsatile
expression gene encoding cyp6m2, cytochrome p450 metabolizes
pyrethroid insecticides. explored interaction light circadian
clock highlight regulation odorant binding proteins (obps), important 
components olfactory system. reveal obps unique expression
patterns mosquitoes make transition ld dd conditions. compared 
rhythmic expression an. gambiae ae. aegypti heads collected ld 
conditions using single cosine fitting algorithm, report distinct
similarities differences temporal regulation genes involved trna
priming, vesicular-type atpase, olfaction vision two species.
conclusions: data build previous analyses time-of-day specific
regulation an. gambiae transcriptome reveal additional rhythmic genes, 
an improved understanding co-regulation rhythms gene expression by
the circadian clock light, understanding time-of-day
specific regulation rhythmic processes comparison a
different species mosquito. improved understanding biological timing the
molecular level underlies key physiological aspects mosquito vectors may 
prove important successful implementation established novel
insect control methods.
