background: public health efforts seek eradicate malaria, an
emphasis eliminating low-density parasite reservoirs asymptomatic carriers.
as such, diagnosing submicroscopic plasmodium infections using pcr-based
techniques become important clinical trials malaria vaccines
and therapeutics, also active malaria surveillance campaigns. however,
pcr-based quantitative assays rely nucleic acid extracted dried
blood spots (dbs) demonstrated lower sensitivity assays use
cryopreserved whole blood source material.
methods: density plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites quantified
using genomic dna extracted dried blood spots (dbs) sensitivity of
two approaches compared: quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) targeting p.
falciparum 18s ribosomal rna gene, either initial conventional pcr
amplification prior qpcr (nested qpcr), without initial amplification
(qpcr only). parasite densities determined nested qpcr, qpcr only, light
microscopy compared.
results: nested qpcr results 10-fold higher sensitivity (0.5 parasites/Î¼l)
when compared qpcr (five parasites/ul). among microscopy-positive
samples, parasite densities calculated nested qpcr correlated strongly with
microscopy asymptomatic (pearson's r=0.58, p<0.001) symptomatic
(pearson's r=0.70, p<0.0001) p. falciparum infections.
conclusion: nested qpcr improves sensitivity detection p.
falciparum blood-stage infection clinical dbs samples. approach may 
useful active malaria surveillance areas submicroscopic asymptomatic
infections prevalent.
