as many malaria-endemic countries move towards elimination plasmodium
falciparum, virulent human malaria parasite, effective tools for
monitoring malaria epidemiology urgent priorities. p. falciparum population
genetic approaches offer promising tools understanding transmission and
spread disease, high prevalence multi-clone polygenomic
infections render estimation even basic parameters, as
allele frequencies, challenging. previous method, coil, developed to
estimate complexity infection (coi) single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) 
data, relies monogenomic infections estimate allele frequencies or
requires external allele frequency data may available. estimates
limited monogenomic infections may representative, however, when
the average coi high, difficult impossible obtain.
therefore, developed real mccoil, turning heterozygous snp data into
robust estimates alelle frequency, via markov chain monte carlo, and
complexity infection using likelihood, incorporate polygenomic samples 
simultaneously estimate allele frequency coi. approach tested via
simulations applied snp data cross-sectional surveys performed in
three ugandan sites varying malaria transmission. show real
mccoil consistently outperforms coil simulated data, particularly most
infections polygenomic. using field data show that, unlike coil, we
can distinguish epidemiologically relevant differences coi within 
these sites. surprisingly, example, estimated high average coi a
peri-urban subregion lower transmission intensity, suggesting many of
these cases imported surrounding regions higher transmission
intensity. real mccoil therefore provides robust tool understanding the
molecular epidemiology malaria across transmission settings.
