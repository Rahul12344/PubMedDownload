despite potential benefit primaquine reducing plasmodium falciparum
transmission radical cure plasmodium vivax plasmodium ovale
infections, concerns risk hemolytic toxicity individuals with
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pdd) hampered its
deployment. cross-sectional survey conducted 2014 assess g6pdd
prevalence among 631 children 6 59 months age southwestern
uganda, area primaquine may promising control measure. g6pdd
prevalence determined using three detection methods: quantitative g6pd
enzyme activity assay (trinity biotech® g-6-pdh kit), qualitative point-of-care
test (carestart™ g6pd rapid diagnostic test [rdt]), molecular detection of
the g6pd a- g202a allele. qualitative tests compared gold standard 
quantitative assay. g6pdd prevalence higher rdt (8.6%) by
quantitative assay (6.8%), using < 60% activity threshold. rdt performed
optimally < 60% threshold demonstrated high sensitivity (≥ 90%) and
negative predictive values (100%) across three activity thresholds (below 60%,
30%, 40%). g202a allele frequency 6.4%, 7.9%, 6.8% among females,
males, overall, respectively. notably, half g202a
homo-/hemizygous children expressed ≥ 60% enzyme activity. overall, the
carestart™ g6pd rdt appears viable screening test accurately identify 
individuals enzyme activities 60%. low prevalence g6pdd across 
all three diagnostic modalities absence severe deficiency study
suggests little barrier use single-dose primaquine in
this region.
