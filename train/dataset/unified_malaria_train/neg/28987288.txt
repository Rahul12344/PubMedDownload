the alignment evolutionary history parasites plants
provides different panorama drug development process. housing of
different metabolic processes, essential parasite survival, adds the
indispensability apicoplast. different pathways responsible for
fueling apicoplast parasite offer myriad proteins responsible for
the apicoplast function. studies emphasizing target-based approaches
might help discovery antimalarials. different putative drug targets
and roles highlighted. addition, origin apicoplast and
metabolic processes reviewed different drugs acting upon enzymes 
of apicoplast discussed.
