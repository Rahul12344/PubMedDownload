as primary virulence factor falciparum malaria, var genes harboring
mutually exclusive expression pattern lead antigenic variation immune
evasion pathogen human host. although various mechanisms contribute to
silence var genes, little known transcriptional activation pathways a
single var gene maintenance active state silent var loci.
here, report monoallelic expression pattern non-coding gc-elements
flanking chromosomal internal var genes, transcript active one was
required activation var gene array. meanwhile, gfp
reporter assays revealed repressive effect adjacent gene induced dna 
motifs insulator-like gc-element, linked heterochromatin
subnuclear localization. taken together, data first time provide
experimental evidence dual cis- trans-acting regulatory functions of
the gc-elements silence activation var genes, would advance 
our understanding complex regulatory network virulence gene family 
in p. falciparum.
