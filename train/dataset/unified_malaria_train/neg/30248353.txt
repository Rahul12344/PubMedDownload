objectives: dissect transcriptional networks underpinning immune cells
responses primary plasmodium vivax infection healthy human adults.
methods: conducted network co-expression analysis next-generation rna
sequencing data whole blood p. vivax p. falciparum controlled human
malaria infection (chmi) healthy naïve malaria-exposed volunteers. single 
cell transcription signatures used deconvolute bulk rna-seq data into
cell-specific signals.
results: initial exposure p. vivax induced activation innate immunity,
including efficient antigen presentation complement activation. however, this
effect accompanied strong immunosuppression mediated dendritic cells
via induction indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(ido1) lymphocyte
activation gene 3 (lag3). additionally, p. vivax induced depletion neutrophil 
populations associated regulation 3g-protein coupled receptors,
crxcr1, cxcr2 csf3r. accordingly, malaria-exposed volunteers the
inflammatory response attenuated, decreased class ii antigen
presentation dendritic cells. immunosuppressive signalling was
maintained plasmodium species, response p. falciparum was
significantly immunogenic.
conclusions: silico analyses suggest primary infection p. vivax
induces potent immunosuppression mediated dendritic cells, conditioning
subsequent anti-malarial immune responses. targeting immune evasion mechanisms
could effective alternative improving vaccine efficacy.
