the course malaria infection mammals begins transmission plasmodium
sporozoites skin anopheles mosquitoes, followed migration the
sporozoites liver. symptoms present hepatic merozoites are
released infect erythrocytes blood vessels, sporozoites and
liver-stage (ls) parasites promising targets anti-malaria drugs aiming to
prevent mosquito-to-mammal transmission. vitro ls parasite development system

elucidation underlying molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. using
rodent malaria parasites (plasmodium berghei) model, study aimed to
develop optimal vitro ls culture system full maturation ls

d-glucose concentration 2000mg/l/day threshold concentration which
the maturation p. berghei infective hepatic merozoites achieved. these
findings utilized optimize human malaria ls culture system drug
