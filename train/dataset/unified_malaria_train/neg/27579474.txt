severe malarial anemia [sma, hemoglobin (hb) <5.0 g/dl] leading cause of
global morbidity mortality among children residing plasmodium falciparum
transmission regions. exploration molecular pathways global gene
expression profiling revealed sma characterized decreased hspa1a, a
heat shock protein (hsp) 70 coding gene. hsp70 ubiquitous chaperone that
regulates nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) signaling production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines known important malaria pathogenesis (e.g.,
il-1β, il-6 tnf-α). since role host hsp70 malaria pathogenesis is
unexplored, investigated hsp70 molecular pathways children sma.
validation experiments revealed leukocytic hsp70 transcripts reduced in
sma relative non-severe malaria, intraleukocytic hemozoin (pfhz) 
associated lower hsp70. hsp70 correlated reticulocyte production
and hb. since glutamine (gln) up-regulates hsp70, modulates nf-κb activation, and
attenuates over-expression pro-inflammatory cytokines, circulating gln was
measured children malaria. reduced gln associated increased risk
of developing sma. treatment cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmcs) pfhz caused time-dependent decrease hsp70 transcripts/protein, 
and nf-κb activation. gln treatment pbmcs overcame pfhz-induced suppression of
hsp70 transcripts/protein, reduced nf-κb activation, suppressed
over-expression il-1β, il-6 tnf-α. findings demonstrate sma is
characterized reduced intraleukocytic hsp70 circulating gln, that
pfhz-induced suppression hsp70 reversed gln. thus, gln
supplementation may offer important immunotherapeutic options futures studies
in children sma.
