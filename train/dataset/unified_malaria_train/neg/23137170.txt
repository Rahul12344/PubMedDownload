background: study plasmodium falciparum heavy metal transporter gene
pfmdr2 employed radioactive labelled heavy metal. use radioactive
isotopes shrank considerably last years, resulting the
cessation production isotopes, amongst cadmium109 was
used purpose, different approach developed. herein, dual
fluorescent labelling heavy metals accumulation p. falciparum parasite 
is proposed alternative use radioactive labelled heavy metals.
methods: plasmodium falciparum cd resistant sensitive strains the
trophozoite stage used study. cells cultured different
cdcl2 concentrations different time periods followed staining the
infected red blood cells fluo-3/am cd detection hoechst 33342 for
parasite dna labelling. fluorescent analysis done flow cytometry and
confocal microscopy.
results: results show sensitive strain higher fluo-3/am
fluorescence cd concentration time dependent manner, whereas the
resistant strain fluo-3/am fluorescence levels negligible increased only
at high concentrations cd long incubation periods, much lesser
extent sensitive strain. cd uptake observed uninfected red
blood cells populations originating cultures infected either sensitive 
or resistant strain. addition, confocal microscopy overlay fluo-3/am and
hoechst staining shows cd metal accumulates parasite itself.
conclusions: dual fluorescent labelling valid method detecting heavy
metal accumulation p. falciparum. furthermore, contrast use of
radioactive labelled heavy metal, fluorescent labelling enables us to
differentiate different populations existing p. falciparum
infected red blood cells cultures thus actually study phenomenon the
level single cell.
