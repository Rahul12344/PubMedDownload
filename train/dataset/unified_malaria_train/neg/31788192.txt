environmental conditions play major role shaping spatial distributions
of pathogens, turn drive local adaptation divergence host
genetic diversity. haemosporidians, plasmodium (malaria), strong
selective force, impacting survival fitness hosts, geographic
distributions largely determined habitat suitability insect vectors.
here, tested whether patterns fine-scale local adaptation malaria
are replicated across discrete, ecologically differing island populations of
berthelot's pipits anthus berthelotii. sequenced tlr4, innate immunity gene
that potentially positive selection berthelot's pipits, two snps 
previously identified associated malaria infection genome-wide
association study (gwas) berthelot's pipits canary islands. we
determined environmental predictors malaria infection, using to
estimate variation malaria risk porto santo, found congruence with
previously identified environmental risk factors tenerife. also found a
negative association malaria infection tlr4 variant tenerife. in
contrast, one gwas snps showed association malaria risk porto
santo, opposite direction found canary islands gwas.
together, findings suggest disease-driven local adaptation may an
important factor shaping variation among island populations.
