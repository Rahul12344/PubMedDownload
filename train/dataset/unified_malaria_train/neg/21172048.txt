background: obligate intracellular parasite, apicomplexa interacts the
host special living environment, competing energy nutrients from
the host cells manipulating host metabolism. previous studies of
host-parasite interaction mainly focused using cellular biochemical
methods investigate molecular functions metabolic pathways parasite
infected hosts. computational approaches taking advantage high-throughput
biological data topology metabolic pathways great potential in
revealing details mechanism parasites-to-host interactions. new
analytical method designed work study host-parasite interactions
in human cells infected plasmodium falciparum cryptosporidium parvum.
results: introduced new method analyzes host metabolic pathways 
divided parts: host specific subpathways host-parasite common subpathways.
upon analysis gene expression data cells infected plasmodium
falciparum cryptosporidium parvum, found: (i) six host-parasite common
subpathways four host specific subpathways significantly altered in
plasmodium infected human cells; (ii) plasmodium utilized fatty acid biosynthesis
and elongation, pantothenate coa biosynthesis obtain nutrients from
host environment; (iii) cryptosporidium parvum infected cells, the
host-parasite common enzymes down-regulated, whereas host specific
enzymes up-regulated; (iv) down-regulation common subpathways host
cells might caused competition substrates up-regulation host
specific subpathways may stimulated parasite infection.
conclusion: results demonstrated significantly coordinated expression pattern
between two groups subpathways. method helped expose impact of
parasite infection host cell metabolism, previously concealed the
pathway enrichment analysis. approach revealed detailed subpathways and
metabolic information important symbiosis two kinds the
apicomplex parasites, highlighted significance research and
understanding parasite-host interactions.
