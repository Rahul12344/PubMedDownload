despite significant drop malaria deaths past decade, malaria
continues one biggest health problems around globe. wd40 repeats
(wdrs) containing proteins comprise one largest functionally diverse
protein superfamily eukaryotes, acting scaffolds assembling large
protein complexes. present study, report extensive silico
analysis wdr gene family human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. 
our genome-wide identification revealed 80 putative wdr genes p.
falciparum (pfwdrs). five distinct domain compositions discovered in
plasmodium compared human host. notably, 31 pfwdrs were
annotated/re-annotated basis orthologs species.
interestingly, pfwdrs larger compared human homologs
highlighting presence parasite-specific insertions. fifteen pfwdrs
appeared specific plasmodium assigned orthologs. expression
profiling pfwdrs revealed mixture linear nonlinear relationships
between transcriptome proteome, nine pfwdrs found be
stage-specific. homology modeling identified conservation major binding sites 
in pfcaf-1 pfrack. protein-protein interaction network analyses suggested
that pfwdrs highly connected proteins ~1928 potential interactions,
supporting role hubs cellular networks. present study highlights 
the roles relevance wdr family p. falciparum, identifies unique
features lay foundation experimental dissection pfwdrs.
