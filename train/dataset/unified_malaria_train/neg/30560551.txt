the dual occurrence pseudomonas-like wolbachia endobacteria been
investigated pederus beetles yet. investigated pederin-producing
bacteria (ppb) infection paederus fuscipes specimens southern margins
of caspian sea designed genus-specific (oprf) species-specific (16s
rrna) primers. wolbachia infection studied nested-pcr assay of
wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene. 125 analyzed beetles, 42 females
(82.35%) 15 males (20.27%) positive ppb infection; first 
study reporting male p. fuscipes infection ppb. wolbachia infection found 
in 45 female (88.23%) 50 male (67.57%) analyzed beetles. surprisingly, a
number 36 females (70.59%) 13 males (17.57%) found infected
with ppb wolbachia endosymbionts. general, population infection rates
to ppb wolbachia determined 45.6% 76%, respectively. the
infection rates female beetles ppb ppb-wolbachia significantly
higher males. paederus species, female beetles shelter ppb the
discovery bacterium adult males may reflect cannibalistic
behavior contaminated stages. phylogenetic analysis showed the
sequences oprf gene unique among pseudomonas spp.; however, sequences 
16s rrna gene related ppb pederus species. co-occurrence and
random distribution endobacteria may imply putative tripartite
interactions among ppb, wolbachia, paederus. order elucidate these
possible tripartite interactions, studies required even gender
level.
