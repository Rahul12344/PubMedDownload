the malaria gametocyte, gamete precursor, essential stage malaria 
transmission mosquito vector. vertebrate host's blood, develops 
into mature male female capable transforming gamete the
mosquito blood meal. despite importance stage malaria life
cycle, genetic regulation gametocyte development poorly understood. 
particular, transcription factors involved sex-specific gene expression have
not identified. paper, report ap2-family transcription
factor, ap2-fg, responsible female-specific gene regulation. ap2-fg
expression plasmodium berghei observed exclusively female gametocytes, 
in beginning 4-6 h sexual dimorphism manifests developing
gametocytes. ap2-fg disruption resulted arrest female maturation, but
did affect development males. chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
analysis suggested ap2-fg directly regulates 700 genes. targets
include genes female gametocyte-specific functions, gametogenesis,
fertilization zygote development. ap2-fg binding target gene promoters was
associated 10 bp sequence motif. results indicate ap2-fg plays 
a role differentiation early gametocytes mature females governing
a female-specific gene expression repertoire.
