background: past decade, estimates malaria infections dropped from
500 million 225 million per year; likewise, mortality rates dropped 
3 million 791,000 per year. however, approximately 90% deaths
continue occur sub-saharan africa, 85% involve children less 5
years age. malaria mortality children generally results one of
the following clinical syndromes: severe anemia, acidosis, cerebral malaria. 
although much known clinical pathological manifestations cm, 
insights biology malaria parasite, specifically transcription
during manifestation severe infection, lacking.
methods findings: collected peripheral blood children meeting the
clinical case definition cerebral malaria cohort malawi, examined
the patients presence absence malaria retinopathy, performed
whole genome transcriptional profiling plasmodium falciparum using custom
designed affymetrix array. identified two distinct physiological states that
showed highly significant association level parasitemia. compared 
both groups malawi expression profiles previously acquired ex vivo
expression profiles parasites derived infected patients mild
disease; large collection vitro plasmodium falciparum life cycle gene
expression profiles; extensively annotated compendium expression data
from saccharomyces cerevisiae. high parasitemia patient group demonstrated 
unique biology elevated expression hrd1, member endoplasmic
reticulum-associated protein degradation system.
conclusions: presence unique high parasitemia state may indicative of
the parasite biology clinically recognized hyperparasitemic severe disease
syndrome.
