trypanosoma evansi (t. evansi) widely spread pathogenic trypanosome
in world. control trypanosomiasis depends accurate diagnosis and
effective treatment. focusing presence t. evansi asia, developed 
a detection assay based tracing phosphate ions (pi) generated lamp
targeting variant surface glycoprotein (vsg) gene rode trypanozoon
antigenic type 1.2 (rotat 1.2 vsg). diagnostic potential well use
of assay test-of-cure method berenil treatment, assessed in
mice different time points infection. addition, 67 buffalo blood
collected tongling county, anhui province, well 42 cattle sera from
the shanghai area, used evaluate diagnostic validity test. the
detection limit novel lamp assay determined low 1 fg t.
evansi dna, reaction time test 30min. hence it
outperforms microscopy pcr. test-of-cure assessment, successful
berenil mediated cure could confirmed within 48h treatment. offers 
a tremendous advantage conventional antibody-based diagnostic tools which
successful cure confirmed months. cattle buffalo
screening, lamp able detect false-negative determined sample,
wrongly classified conventional microscopy pcr screening. finally, no
cross-reactivity observed zoonotic parasites, t. evansi
type b, t. congolense, t. brucei, schistosoma japonicum, plasmodium falciparum,
leishmania donovani, toxoplasma gondii angiostrongylus cantonensis. we
conclude novel lamp assay sensitive, specific convenient for
field use, particularly areas infection incidence become extremely
low. lamp assay could used tool trypanosomiasis control and
elimination strategies areas t. evansi type infections causing a
threat livestock farming.
