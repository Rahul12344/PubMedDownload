in 2008, dihydroartemisinin (dha)-piperaquine (ppq) became first-line
treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria western cambodia.
recent reports increased treatment failure rates dha-ppq therapy this
region suggest parasite resistance dha, ppq, adversely
affecting treatment. artemisinin (art) resistance established western
cambodia, evidence ppq resistance. monitor resistance to
ppq antimalarials, measured drug susceptibilities parasites
collected 2011 2012 pursat, preah vihear, ratanakiri, western,
northern, eastern cambodia, respectively. using sybr green fluorescence
assay, calculated ex vivo 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) 310
parasites six antimalarials: chloroquine (cq), mefloquine (mq), quinine (qn), 
ppq, artesunate (ats), dha. geometric mean ic50s (gmic50s) drugs
(except ppq) significantly higher pursat preah vihear in
ratanakiri (p â‰¤ 0.001). increased copy number p. falciparum mdr1 (pfmdr1), 
an mq resistance marker, prevalent pursat preah vihear in
ratanakiri associated higher gmic50s mq, qn, ats, dha. an
increased copy number chromosome 5 region (x5r), candidate ppq resistance 
marker, detected pursat associated reduced susceptibility
to ppq. ex vivo ic50 pfmdr1 copy number important tools the
surveillance multidrug-resistant (mdr) parasites cambodia. mdr p.
falciparum prevalent western northern cambodia, evidence
for ppq resistance, suggesting dha-ppq treatment failures result mainly from
art resistance.
