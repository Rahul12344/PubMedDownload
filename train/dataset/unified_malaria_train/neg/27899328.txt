during life cycle plasmodium parasites rely upon arsenal proteins
that establish key interactions host vector, the
parasite sexual stages, purpose ensuring infection, reproduction 
proliferation. among group secreted membrane-anchored proteins
known six-cysteine (6-cys) family. small important family
with 14 members thus far identified, stage-specifically expressed
during parasite life cycle. 6-cys proteins often localise parasite
surface interface host vector, conserved different
plasmodium species. unifying feature family s48/45 domain,
presumably involved adhesion structurally related ephrins, ligands 
of eph receptors. prominent s48/45 members currently under
functional investigation pursued vaccine candidates. this
review, examine known 6-cys family, structure and
function, discuss future research directions.
