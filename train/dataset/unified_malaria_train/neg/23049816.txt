the malarial parasite plasmodium must complete complex lifecycle its
anopheles mosquito host, main vector plasmodium. mosquito resists

rnai-mediated depletion kto skd anopheles gambiae cell line l5-3
resulted decrease transcript abundance cec1, controlled
by imd pathway. silencing two genes also resulted increased

but infection rodent malaria parasite p. berghei. also showed 
that kto skd transcriptional co-activators rel2 key
factors imd pathway; however, participate regulation the
imd pathway, crucial mosquito's defense p. falciparum.
