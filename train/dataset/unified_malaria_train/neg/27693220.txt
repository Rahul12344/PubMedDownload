avian coccidiosis widespread economically significant disease of
poultry. enteric disease caused several protozoan eimeria species.
eimeria belongs phylum apicomplexa, exhibits unusual mechanism of
host cell invasion. invasion host cells, protein apical membrane
antigen 1 (ama1) essential invasion toxoplasma gondii plasmodium.
contrary roles ama1 host cell invasion t. gondii and
plasmodium, precise functions eimeria ama1 (etama1) unclear. order 
to study functions etama1, yeast two-hybrid cdna library constructed
from e. tenella sporozoites. etama1 ectodomain cloned pgbkt7
vector construct bait plasmid pgbkt7- etama1. autoactivation toxicity 
of bait protein yeast cells tested comparison pgbkt7
empty vector. expression bait protein detected western blots. the
bait plasmid pgbkt7-etama1 used screen yeast two-hybrid cdna library 
e. tenella sporozoites. multiple screenings high-screening-rate medium
and exclusion false-positive plasmids, positive preys sequenced and
analyzed using blast. obtained 14 putative etama1-interacting proteins
including e. tenella acidic microneme protein2 (etmic2), e. tenella putative
cystathionine beta-synthase, e. tenella eimeria-specific protein, four e. tenella
conserved hypothetical proteins (one serine/threonine protein kinase
family) seven unknown proteins. gene ontology analysis indicated two
known proteins associated metabolic process, pyridoxal phosphate
binding protein phosphorylation. functional analysis indicated etmic2 was
implicated parasite motility, migration, recognition invasion host
cells. data suggested etama1 may important host cell invasion,
but also involved biological processes.
