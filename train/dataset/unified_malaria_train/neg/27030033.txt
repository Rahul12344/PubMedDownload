background: increasing spread insecticide resistance malaria vectors
has well documented across sub-saharan africa countries. influence of
irrigation increasing vector resistance poorly understood, critical 
to successful ethical implementation food security policies. study
investigated insecticide resistance status an. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes
collected irrigated rice area okyereko, village containing 42
hectares irrigated field within irrigation project plan central
region ghana. large amounts insecticides, herbicides fertilizers are
commonly used area boost annual production rice.
methods: mosquito larvae collected adults assayed f1
progeny. resistance status, allele genotype characterized using 
susceptibility testing pcr methods respectively.
results: an. gambiae (s.l.) populations okyereko highly resistant to
ddt pyrethroid insecticides, possible involvement metabolic
mechanisms including elevation p450 gst enzyme well p-gp
activity. population mostly composed an. coluzzii specimens (more than
96 %) kdr ace-1 frequencies 0.9 0.2 %, respectively.
conclusion: study brings additional information insecticide resistance
and characterization an. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes okyereko, which
can helpful decision making vector control programmes region.
