infectious disease represents emerging threat natural populations,
particularly hosts susceptible novel parasites (allopatric) than
to parasites local area (sympatric). pattern could arise through
evolutionary processes (host populations become adapted local parasites 
and genetically differentiated populations immune-related loci)
and/or ecological interactions (host individuals develop resistance to
local parasites previous exposure). relative importance these
candidate mechanisms remains unclear. jawed vertebrates, genes major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) play fundamental role immunity are
compelling candidates spatially varying selection. recently showed that
song sparrows (melospiza melodia) susceptible allopatric to
sympatric strains malaria (plasmodium). current study, determine
whether population differences mhc explain pattern, characterized 
peptide-binding regions mhc (classes ii) birds not
become infected previous experiment. recovered 4 alleles per
individual class i, implying least 2 loci, 26 alleles per
individual class ii, implying least 13 loci. individuals class 
alleles less likely become infected plasmodium, consistent with
parasite-mediated balancing selection. however, found evidence for
population genetic differentiation either class mhc, based 36
individuals sequenced. resistance sympatric parasites previously described for
this system likely stems individuals' prior immune experience, from
population differentiation locally protective alleles mhc.
