malaria among serious infectious diseases affecting humans,
accounting approximately half million deaths year. plasmodium
falciparum causes life-threatening cases malaria. acquired immunity to
malaria inefficient, even repeated exposure p. falciparum, the
immune regulatory mechanisms used p. falciparum remain largely unknown. here
we show p. falciparum uses immune inhibitory receptors achieve immune
evasion. rifin proteins products polymorphic multigene family comprising
approximately 150-200 genes per parasite genome expressed surface
of infected erythrocytes. found subset rifins binds either
leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor b1 (lilrb1) leucocyte-associated
immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (lair1). lilrb1-binding rifins inhibit activation 
of lilrb1-expressing b cells natural killer (nk) cells. furthermore, p.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes isolated patients severe malaria 
more likely interact lilrb1 erythrocytes patients with
non-severe malaria, although extended study larger sample sizes is
required confirm finding. results suggest p. falciparum has
acquired multiple rifins evade host immune system targeting immune
inhibitory receptors.
