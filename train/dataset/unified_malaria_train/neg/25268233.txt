the duffy blood group major interest clinical medicine plays an
important role plasmodium knowlesi plasmodium vivax infection. the
present study, distribution duffy blood group genotypes allelic
frequencies among p. knowlesi infected patients well healthy individuals in
peninsular malaysia determined. blood group 60 healthy blood donors
and 51 p. knowlesi malaria patients genotyped using allele specific
polymerase chain reaction (asp-pcr). data analyzed using fisher's exact
test order assess significance variables. results show a
high proportion fy*a/fy*a genotype (>85% groups) high
frequency fy*a allele (>90% groups). fy*a/fy*a genotype was
the predominant genotype infected healthy blood samples. the
genotype frequency differ significantly donor blood the
malaria patient groups. also, significant correlation between
susceptibility p. knowlesi infection duffy blood genotype.
