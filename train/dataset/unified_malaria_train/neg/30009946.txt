the chromosomes within eukaryotic cell nucleus highly dynamic adopt
complex hierarchical structures. understanding three-dimensional (3d)
nuclear architectureaffects gene regulation, cell cycle progression disease
pathogenesis important biological questions development disease.
recently, many genome-wide technologies including chromosome conformation capture
(3c) 3c-based methodologies (4c, 5c, hi-c) developed to
investigate 3d chromatin structure. review, introduce 3d genome
methodologies, focus application understanding nuclear
architecture human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum. increasing 
amount evidence suggests gene regulation parasite largely
regulated epigenetic mechanisms nuclear reorganization. here, explore
the 3d genome architecture p. falciparum, including local global chromatin
structure. addition, molecular components important maintaining 3d
chromatin organization including architectural proteins long non-coding rnas 
are discussed. collectively, studies contribute understanding how
the plasticity 3d genome architecture regulates gene expression cell cycle
progression deadly parasite.
