an essential component malaria vector control programmes detection of
plasmodium falciparum within mosquito vectors, particularly salivary
glands infective sporozoites reside. several protocols been
developed purpose; however require dissection mosquito specimens
prior analysis. here, novel one-step rt-qpcr taqman diagnostic assay was
developed mosquitoes infective plasmodium falciparum sporozoites 
salivary glands. based detection sporozoite-specific pfslarp 
pfplp1 gene transcripts. transcripts chosen based bioinformatics
analysis, experimentally verified overexpressed salivary gland
sporozoite stage parasite compared mosquito parasite stages. 
proof principle performance assay demonstrated using
rnalater preserved mosquito samples. tests analytical sensitivity showed the
novel taqman assay 100% accurate, although performance field
needs demonstrated. method requirement dissection
and post-pcr processing thus simple rapid perform individual
mosquitoes mosquito pools. used single multiplex formats also 
targeting additional markers expressed different tissues, as
detoxification enzymes associated insecticide resistance.
