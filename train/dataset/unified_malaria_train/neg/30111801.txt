malaria parasites transmitted mosquito bite remarkably efficient in
establishing human infections. infection process requires roughly 30â€‰minutes 
and highly complex quiescent sporozoites injected mosquito saliva must
be rapidly activated skin, migrate body, infect liver.
this process poorly understood plasmodium vivax due low infectivity 
the vitro models. study skin-to-liver-stage malaria, used
quantitative bioassays coupled transcriptomics evaluate parasite changes 
linked mammalian microenvironmental factors. vitro phenotyping and
rna-seq analyses revealed key microenvironmental relationships distinct
biological functions. notable, preservation sporozoite quiescence by
exposure insect-like factors coupled strategic activation limits untimely
activation invasion-associated genes dramatically increase hepatocyte
invasion rates. also report first transcriptomic analysis p. vivax 
sporozoite interaction salivary glands identifying 118 infection-related
differentially-regulated anopheles dirus genes. results provide important
new insights malaria parasite biology identify priority targets for
antimalarial therapeutic interventions block p. vivax infection.
