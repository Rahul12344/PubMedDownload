the innate immune system anopheles gambiae mosquitoes limits plasmodium
infection multiple molecular mechanisms. example, midgut invasion 
the parasite triggers epithelial nitration response promotes activation
of complement-like system. found suppression jnk pathway, by
silencing either hep, jnk, jun fos expression, greatly enhanced plasmodium
infection; overactivating cascade, silencing suppressor
puckered, opposite effect. jnk pathway limits infection via two
coordinated responses. induces expression two enzymes (hpx2 nox5)
that potentiate midgut epithelial nitration response plasmodium infection
and regulates expression two key hemocyte-derived immune effectors (tep1 and
fbn9). furthermore, an. gambiae l3-5 strain genetically
selected refractory (r) plasmodium infection exhibits constitutive
overexpression genes jnk pathway, well midgut hemocyte
effector genes. silencing experiments confirmed cascade mediates, 
large extent, drastic parasite elimination phenotype characteristic this
mosquito strain. sum, studies revealed jnk pathway key
regulator ability an. gambiae mosquitoes limit plasmodium infection 
and identified several effector genes mediating responses.
