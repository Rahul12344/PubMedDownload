plasmodium vivax classified two serotypes, vk210 [the dominant
form-gdra(d/a)gqpa repeats] vk247 [the variant form-anga(g/d)(n/d)qpg
repeats], based sequence variation repeat region the
circumsporozoite (cs) protein gene. genomic dna variant cs protein gene
was obtained field isolate strains myanmar. repetitive region has
highly 19 immunogenic repeats flanked non-repeat stretches amino acids. the
sequence including region (717 bp) subcloned expression vector 
pqe30 expressed escherichia coli. expressed recombinant protein 
molecular weight 50 kda analyzed sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis. anti-vk247
antibodies found malaria patients exposed variant form
of p. vivax western blot analysis. therefore, recombinant protein might
be useful tool serodiagnosis malaria patients infected with
variant form p. vivax.
