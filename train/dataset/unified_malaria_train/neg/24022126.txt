all eukaryotic genomes genes introns variable sizes. far as
spliceosomal introns concerned, least three basic parameters 
stratify introns across diverse eukaryotic taxa: size, number, sequence
context. number parameter highly variable lower eukaryotes, especially 
among protozoan fungal species, ranges less 4% 78% 
genes. greater evolutionary time scales, number parameter undoubtedly
increases observed higher plants higher vertebrates, reaching greater
than 12.5 exons per gene average among mammalian genomes. size parameter
is complex, multiple modes appear work. aside intronless
genes, three types intron-containing genes: half-sized,
minimal, size-expandable introns. half-sized introns found
in limited number genomes among protozoan fungal lineages 
two types prevalent animal plant genomes. among the
size-expandable introns, sizes plant introns expansion-limited that
the large introns exceeding 1000 bp fewer numbers transposon-free as
compared large introns among animals, larger introns filled 
with transposable elements appear expansion-flexible, reaching several
kilobasepairs (kbp) even thousands kbp size. intron
parameters studied signatures specific splicing machineries of
different eukaryotic lineages highly relevant regulation gene
expression functionality. particular, transcription-splicing-export
coupling eukaryotic intron dispensing leads working hypothesis all
intron parameters evolved efficient function-related processing 
and routing spliced transcripts.
