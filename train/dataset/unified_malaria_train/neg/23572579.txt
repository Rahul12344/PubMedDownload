gametocytes essential plasmodium transmission, little known 
the mechanisms lead formation. using piggybac transposon-mediated
insertional mutagenesis, screened parasites longer form mature
gametocytes, led isolation 29 clones (insertional
gametocyte-deficient mutants) fail form mature gametocytes. additional
analysis revealed 16 genes putatively responsible loss of
gametocytogenesis, none previously implicated in
gametocytogenesis. transcriptional profiling detection early stage
gametocyte antigen determined subset mutants arrests development 
at stage early stage ii gametocytes, likely representing genes involved
in gametocyte maturation. remaining mutants seem arrest formation
of stage gametocytes may represent genes involved commitment the
gametocyte lineage.
