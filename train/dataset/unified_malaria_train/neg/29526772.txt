previously, sanger-based sialotranscriptome analysis adult female culex
tarsalis published based ∼2000 ests. elapsed 7.5 years,
pyrosequencing discontinued illumina sequences increased
considerable size decreased price. report illumina-based
sialotranscriptome allowed finding missing apyrase salivary
transcriptome c. tarsalis, determine several full-length members the
34-62 kda family, single est found previously, addition to
identifying many salivary families lower expression levels not
detected previously. use multiple libraries including salivary glands 
carcasses male female organisms allowed unprecedented insight
into tissue specificity transcripts, particular case
permitting identification transcripts putatively associated blood
feeding, exclusive female salivary glands, associated sugar
feeding, transcripts found upregulated male female glands.
