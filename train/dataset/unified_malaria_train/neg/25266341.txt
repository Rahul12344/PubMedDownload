utilization multiple putatively neutral dna markers inferring evolutionary
history species population considered robust approach.
molecular population genetic studies conducted many species of
anopheles genus, studies based single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) data
are still scarce. anopheles minimus one principal malaria vectors 
of southeast (se) asia including northeastern (ne) india. although population
genetic studies mitochondrial genetic variation data utilized to
infer phylogeography se asian populations species, limited
information population structure demography indian an. minimus is
available. herewith developed multilocus nuclear genetic approach with
snp markers located x chromosome an. minimus eight indian two se
asian population samples (121 individual mosquitoes total) infer population
history test several hypotheses phylogeography species. 
the thai population sample an. minimus presented highest nucleotide
diversity, majority indian samples also fairly diverse. general,
an. minimus populations moderately substructured distribution range
covering se asia ne india, largely falling three distinct genetic
clusters. moreover, demographic expansion events could detected the
majority presently studied populations an. minimus. additional dna
sequencing mitochondrial coii region subset samples (40
individual mosquitoes) corroborated existing hypothesis indian an. minimus
falling earlier reported mitochondrial lineage b.
