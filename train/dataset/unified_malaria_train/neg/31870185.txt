introduction: bromodomains (brds) bind acetylated lysine residues, often on
histones. brd proteins contribute gene regulation either directly
through enzymatic activity indirectly recruitment of
chromatin-modifying complexes transcription factors. evidence of
direct orthologues plasmodium falciparum brd proteins (pfbdps) outside the
apicomplexans. pfbdps expressed parasite's life cycle 
human host's blood mosquito. pfbdps could also prove promising
targets novel antimalarials, urgently required address
increasing drug resistance.areas covered: review discusses recent studies of
the biology pfbdps, current target-based strategies pfbdp inhibitor
discovery, different approaches important step validating the
specificity hit compounds pfbdps.expert opinion: novelty plasmodium
brds suggests could targeted selective compounds. chemical series
that showed promise screens human brds could leveraged create
targeted compound libraries, could hits p. falciparum phenotypic screens.
these targeted libraries hits could screened target-based strategies
aimed discovery optimization novel inhibitors pfbdps. key task for
the field generate parasite assays validate hit compounds'
specificity pfbdps.
