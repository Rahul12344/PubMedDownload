pharmaceutical terpenoids belong diverse class natural products.
they significant curative effects variety diseases, cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, malaria alzheimer's disease. nowadays, elicitors,
including biotic abiotic elicitors, often used activate pathway of
secondary metabolism enhance production target terpenoids. based on
agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, several plant metabolic
engineering strategies hold great promise regulate biosynthesis of
pharmaceutical terpenoids. overexpressing terpenoids biosynthesis pathway genes
in homologous ectopic plants effective strategy enhance yield of
pharmaceutical terpenoids. another strategy suppress expression of
competitive metabolic pathways. addition, global regulation includes
regulating relative transcription factors, endogenous phytohormones and
primary metabolism could also markedly increase yield. strategies
offer great opportunities enhance supply scarce terpenoids drugs,
reduce price expensive drugs improve people's standards living.
