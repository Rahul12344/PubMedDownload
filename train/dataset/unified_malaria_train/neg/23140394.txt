background: artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) mainstay global
efforts treatment plasmodium falciparum malaria, decline its
efficacy important obstacle towards malaria control elimination. 
therefore, present molecular analysis provides information putative
mutations associated artemisinin resistance p. falciparum clinical
population unexposed exposed artesunate 4 years adoption act as
the first-line anti-malarial therapy iran.
methods: study, blood samples (n = 226) collected uncomplicated
p. falciparum-infected patients different health centers chabahar
district sistan baluchistan province south-eastern part iran,
during 2003 2010. collected isolates analysed putative candidate 
mutations (tta) l263e (gaa), (gaa) e431k (aaa), (gca) a623e (gaa) (agt) s769n
(aat) pfatpase6 gene using nested pcr/rflp, followed sequencing.
furthermore, gene copy number assessed real-time quantitative pcr
(rt-qpcr) presence sybr green.
results: neither pfatpase6 l263e a623e mutation detected among
all examined isolates. e431k mutation found 23% analysed
samples unexposed act; however, detected 17.8% (34/191) p.
falciparum isolates exposed artesunate 2007. high frequency this
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) (overall 18.6%) among examined groups 
(x2 test, p>0.05) indicated snp considered unrelated
mutation artemisinin resistance. contrast, s769n mutation detected 
in unexposed isolates; however, found 2.6% (5/191), four years after
introduction act malaria setting. also, detected snps not
significantly frequent unexposed exposed examined isolates (x2 test, 
p> 0.05). investigation copy number pfatpase6 gene revealed similar
number copy (n = 1) isolate sensitive artemisinin.
conclusion: taken together, results suggest, particular, pfatpase6
s769n gene needs consideration possible association artesunate 
resistance among p. falciparum isolates.
