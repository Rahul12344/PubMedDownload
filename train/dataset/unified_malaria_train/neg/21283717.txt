tryptophan-rich proteins several malarial parasites identified
where play important role host-parasite interaction. structural
characterization proteins needed develop therapeutic
targets. here, describe novel plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich protein named
pvtrag33.5. expressed blood stage(s) parasite gene
contains two exons. exon 1 encodes 23 amino acids long putative signal 
peptide likely cleaved whereas exon 2 encodes the
mature protein 252 amino acids. mature protein contains b-cell epitopes
which recognized human immune system p.vivax infection. the
pvtrag33.5 contains 24 (9.5%) tryptophan residues six motifs whose patterns
were similar among tryptophan-rich proteins. modeled structure the
pvtrag33.5 consists multidomain architecture stabilized the
presence large number tryptophan residues. recombinant pvtrag33.5
showed predominantly α helical structure alpha helix beta sheet transition
at ph 4.5. protein acquires irreversible non-native state temperature
more 50°c neutral ph. secondary tertiary structures remain stable
in presence 35% alcohol structures destabilized higher
alcohol concentrations due disturbance hydrophobic interactions between
tryptophanyl residues. structural changes protein might occur during
its translocation interact proteins final destination for
biological function erythrocyte invasion.
