background: γ-irradiation commonly used create attenuation plasmodium
parasites. however, systematic studies survival, reversion of
virulence, molecular basis γ-radiation-induced cell death malaria
parasites.
methods: effect γ-irradiation growth asexual plasmodium
falciparum studied erythrocyte cultures. cellular ultrastructural
changes within parasite studied fluorescence electron microscopy,
and genome-wide transcriptional profiling performed identify parasite
biomarkers attenuation cell death.
results: γ-radiation induced death p. falciparum dose-dependent
manner. parasites defective mitosis, sparse cytoplasm, fewer ribosomes,
disorganized clumped organelles, large vacuoles-observations consistent
with "distressed" dying parasites. total 185 parasite genes were
transcriptionally altered response γ-irradiation (45.9% upregulated, 54.1% 
downregulated). loss parasite survival correlated downregulation 
of genes encoding translation factors upregulation genes associated
with messenger rna-sequestering stress granules. genes pertaining cell-surface
interactions, host-cell remodeling, secreted proteins also altered.
conclusions: studies provide framework assess safety of
γ-irradiation attenuation promising targets genetic deletion produce
whole parasite-based attenuated vaccines.
