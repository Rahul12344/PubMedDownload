anopheles stephensi–liston (culicidae: diptera) important urban malarial
vector indian sub-continent, accounting 15% total annual 
malaria incidence. chemical control represents key strategy management
of insect vector. however, owing erratic continuous application of
insecticides, resistance become common phenomenon among their
control become uphill task. genetics alphamethrin, synthetic
pyrethroid resistance studied determine mode inheritance. late 
third instar larvae selectively inbred 27 ten generations to
synthesize homozygous resistant (r) susceptible (s) stocks, respectively, 
the diagnostic dose 0.12 mg l−1. log-dosage probit mortality relationships
and degree dominance (d) calculated. resistance observed both
sexes, dosage-mortality (d-m) line f 1 towards resistant parent
and ‘d’ value found 0.8 indicating alphamethrin resistant (amr)
gene autosomal incompletely dominant. d-m lines f 2/backcross
exhibited clear plateau mortality across range doses indicating
monogenic resistance. null hypothesis monogenic resistance tested
from mortality data backcross progeny compared theoretical expectations
using χ2 test found non-significant. understanding genetics 
insecticide resistance significant prediction management resistant
insects. amr genes used genetic marker a. stephensi, can
be used several applications conducting basic applied genetic research.
