proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) important factor in
plasma cholesterol regulation modulation low density lipoprotein
receptor (ldlr) levels. naturally occurring mutations lead hyper- or
hypocholesterolemia human. recently, reported pcsk9 also able to
modulate cd81 huh7 cells. present study, several gain-of-function and
loss-of-function mutants well engineered mutants pcsk9 compared for
their ability modulate cell surface expression ldlr cd81. although 
pcsk9 gain-of-function d374y enhanced degradation receptors, d374h and
d129n seemed reduce ldlr levels. contrast, mutations c-terminal
hinge-cysteine-histidine-rich domain segment primarily affected pcsk9-induced
cd81 degradation. furthermore, c-terminally fused ace2 transmembrane
anchor, secretory n-terminal catalytic hinge-cysteine-histidine-rich
domain domains pcsk9 able reduce cd81 ldlr levels. data
confirm pcsk9 reduces cd81 levels via intracellular pathway reported
for ldlr. using immunocytochemistry, proximity ligation assay, and
co-immunoprecipitation, found cell surface level pcsk9 was
enhanced upon overexpression cd81 pcsk9 ldlr interact with
this tetraspanin protein. interestingly, using cho-a7 cells lacking ldlr
expression, revealed ldlr required degradation cd81 by
pcsk9, presence strengthened pcsk9 effect.
