background: malaria vector mosquitoes acquire midgut microbiota primarily from
their habitat. homeostasis microbial communities plays essential 
role mosquito longevity, essential factor mosquito
vectorial capacity. recent study revealed silencing genes involved in
regulation midgut homeostasis including fn3d1, fn3d3 gprgr9 reduced
the survival female adult anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes. present
study, investigate stability gene silencing efficiency of
mosquitoes reared three different breeding conditions representing distinct
larval habitat types: town brick pits jimma, flood pools rural land 
asendabo roadside pools wolkite.
methods: first-instar larvae an. arabiensis mosquitoes reared separately 
using water collected three breeding sites. resulting adult females 
were micro-injected dsrna targeting fn3d1 gene (aara003032) their
survival monitored. control mosquitoes injected dsrna lacz. in
addition, load midgut microbiota mosquitoes determined using 
flow cytometry.
results: survival na√Øve adult female mosquitoes differed three
sites. mosquitoes reared using water collected brick pits flood pools
survived longer mosquitoes reared using water collected roadside.
however, fn3d1 gene silencing effect survival differ the
three sites.
conclusions: present study revealed efficacy fn3d1 gene silencing
is affected variation larval habitat. thus, silencing gene has
potential application throughout sub-saharan africa.
