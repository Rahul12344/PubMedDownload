malaria strong selection pressure recent human evolution,
particularly africa. one million deaths per year due malaria, more
than 90% sub-saharan africa, region high levels genetic
variation population substructure. however, studies of
nucleotide variation genetic loci relevant malaria susceptibility 
across geographically genetically diverse ethnic groups africa. invasion
of erythrocytes plasmodium falciparum parasites central pathology of
malaria. glycophorin (gypa) b (gypb), determine mn ss blood
types, two major receptors expressed erythrocyte surfaces and
interact parasite ligands. analyzed nucleotide diversity the
glycophorin gene family 15 african populations different levels of
malaria exposure. high levels nucleotide diversity gene conversion were
found genes. observed divergent patterns genetic variation between
these duplicated genes different extracellular domains gypa.
specifically, identified fixed adaptive changes exons 3-4 gypa. by
contrast, observed allele frequency spectrum skewed toward significant
excess intermediate-frequency alleles gypa exon 2 many populations; 
degree spectrum distortion correlated malaria exposure, possibly
because joint effects gene conversion balancing selection. also 
identified haplotype causing three amino acid changes extracellular
domain glycophorin b. haplotype might evolved adaptively five
populations high exposure malaria.
