background: effective malaria vaccine urgently needed tool fight
against human malaria, deadly parasitic disease humans. one promising
candidate merozoite surface protein-3 (msp-3) plasmodium falciparum.
this antigenic protein, encoded merozoite surface protein (msp-3) gene, is
polymorphic classified according size two allelic types k1 and
3d7. recent study revealed k1 3d7 alleles co-circulated
within p. falciparum populations thailand, extent sequence
diversity variation within allelic type remains largely unknown.
methods: msp-3 gene sequenced 59 p. falciparum samples collected
from five endemic areas (mae hong son, kanchanaburi, ranong, trat ubon
ratchathani) thailand analysed nucleotide sequence diversity,
haplotype diversity deduced amino acid sequence diversity. gene also 
subject population genetic analysis (f st ) neutrality tests (tajima's d, 
fu li d* fu li' f* tests) determine signature selection.
results: sequence analyses revealed eight unique dna haplotypes seven
amino acid sequence variants, haplotype nucleotide diversity 0.828 
and 0.049, respectively. neutrality tests indicated polymorphism
detected alanine heptad repeat region msp-3 maintained positive 
diversifying selection, suggesting role potential target protective
immune responses supporting role vaccine candidate. comparison of
msp-3 variants among parasite populations thailand, india nigeria also
inferred close genetic relationship p. falciparum populations asia.
conclusion: study revealed extent msp-3 gene diversity p.
falciparum thailand, providing fundamental basis better design 
future blood stage malaria vaccines p. falciparum.
