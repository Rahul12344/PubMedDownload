chronic treatment β-blocker carvedilol shown reduce
established maladaptive left ventricle (lv) hypertrophy improve lv
function experimental heart failure. however, detailed mechanisms which
carvedilol improves lv failure incompletely understood. previously showed 
that carvedilol β-arrestin-biased β1-adrenergic receptor ligand, which
activates cellular pathways heart independent g protein-mediated second
messenger signaling. recently, demonstrated microrna (mir)
microarray analysis carvedilol upregulates subset mature pre-mature
mirs, primary mir transcripts mouse hearts. here, next sought
to identify effects carvedilol lv gene expression genome-wide
basis. adult mice treated carvedilol vehicle 1 wk. rna was
isolated lv tissue hybridized microarray analysis. gene expression
profiling analysis revealed small group genes differentially expressed after
carvedilol treatment. analysis categorized genes pathways
involved tight junction, malaria, viral myocarditis, glycosaminoglycan
biosynthesis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. genes encoding
proteins tight junction, malaria, viral myocarditis pathways were
upregulated lv carvedilol, genes encoding proteins the
glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy pathways downregulated carvedilol. gene expression
changes may reflect molecular mechanisms underlie functional
benefits carvedilol therapy.
