exposure plasmodium falciparum associated circulating "atypical"
memory b cells (atmbcs), appear similar dysfunctional b cells found in
hiv-infected individuals. functional analysis atmbcs limited, with
one report suggesting cells dysfunctional produce protective
antibodies. better understand function malaria-associated atmbcs, we
performed global transcriptome analysis cells, obtained individuals
living area high malaria endemicity uganda. comparison gene
expression data suggested down-modulation b cell receptor signaling and
apoptosis atmbcs compared classical mbcs. additionally, contrast to
previous reports, found upregulation fc receptor-like 5 (fcrl5), not
fcrl4, atmbcs. atypical mbcs poor spontaneous producers antibody ex
vivo, higher surface expression fcrl5 defined distinct subset atmbcs 
compromised ability produce antibody upon stimulation. moreover, higher
levels p. falciparum exposure associated increased frequencies of
fcrl5+ atmbcs. together, findings suggest fclr5+ identifies a
functionally distinct, perhaps dysfunctional, subset mbcs individuals
exposed p. falciparum.
