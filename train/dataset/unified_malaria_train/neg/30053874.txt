background: development effective malarial vaccine urgent need.
most glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins plasmodium parasites
are exposed neutralizing antibodies, several advanced vaccine
candidates. present study, plasmodium vivax pv32 (pvx_084815) a
hypothetical, predicted gpi-anchored cysteine-rich motif identified 
our previous findings focus antigenic profiling. orthologue
gene pv32, predicted gpi anchor p. falciparum pf3d7_1434400, still not
been well studied.
methods: gene information pv32 obtained plasmodb. recombinant
pv32 protein expressed purified using wheat germ cell-free expression
system glutathione-sepharose column. naturally acquired immune response 
recombinant pv32 protein evaluated using protein microarray 96
parasite-infected patients 96 healthy individuals. antibodies against
recombinant pv32 proteins immune animals produced, used analyzed
for subcellular localization native pv32 protein immunofluorescence 
assay. total 48 pv32 sequences 11 countries retrieved plasmodb
were used determine genetic diversity, polymorphisms genealogical
relationships dnasp network software packages.
results: pv32 encoded conserved gene two introns located on
chromosome 13 expressed 32 kda protein mature asexual stage
parasites. immunofluorescence data showed pv32 localized merozoite
surface schizont-stage parasites. recombinant pv32 recognized 39.6%
of antibodies p. vivax-infected individuals compared healthy
individuals. low levels nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0028) polymorphisms of
pv32 detected within worldwide isolates.
conclusions: study shows identification characterization the
hypothetical protein, pv32. pv32 provides important characteristics, including 
merozoite surface protein, predicted gpi motif cysteine-rich motif among
plasmodium species. results suggested pv32 immunogenic a
merozoite surface pattern antibodies natural infection humans.
