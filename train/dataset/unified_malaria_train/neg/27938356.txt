background: plasmodium falciparum gametocytes vital sustaining malaria
transmission. parasite densities, multiplicity infection well asexual
genotype features found influence gametocyte production.
measurements prevalence plasmodium sp. gametocytes may serve tool 
to monitor success malaria eradication efforts.
methods: whole blood collected 112 children aged 6 months and
13 years uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria attending three health
facilities southern ghana june august, 2014 (day 0) 4 days 
after completion anti-malaria drug treatment (day 7). malaria parasites were
observed microscopy polymerase chain reaction (pcr); submicroscopic
gametocyte carriage measured pfs25 (pf3d7_1031000) mrna real time
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). parasite genotyping was
performed gdna extracted dried filter paper blood blots amplification 
of polymorphic regions msp1 (pf3d7_0930300) msp2 (pf3d7_0206800) using
pcr.
results: microscopy estimated 3.1% (3/96) total population carry
gametocytes day 0, decreased 2.1% (2/96) day 7. contrast,
reverse transcriptase-real time pcr (rt-pcr) analysis subset 35 samples
estimated submicroscopic gametocyte carriage high 77% (27/35) using
primers specific pfs25 (ct < 35) day 0 day 7 declined 
60% (21/35). genotyping msp2 gene identified higher levels moi the
msp1 gene.
conclusions: although detection microscopy, gametocyte prevalence at
submicroscopic levels high region emphasize need more
effective elimination approaches like development transmission-blocking
vaccines safer gametocytocidal drugs.
