mosquitoes main vector multiple diseases worldwide transmit viral 
(malaria, chikungunya, encephalitis, yellow fever, well dengue fever), as
well bacterial diseases (tularemia). manage outbreak mosquito
populations, various management programs include application chemicals,
followed biological genetic control. aimed focus role of
bacterial pathogenesis molecular tactics management mosquitoes and
their vectorial capacity. bacterial pathogenesis molecular manipulations have
a substantial impact biology mosquitoes, strategies change the
gene expression regulation disease vectors. strategy genetic
modification also proved excellent management mosquitoes,
which halt development population via incompatibility different sex.
therefore, purpose present discussion illustrate impact of
both approaches vectorial capacity mosquitoes. moreover, could 
be helpful understand relationship insect-pathogen manage
various insect vectors well diseases.
