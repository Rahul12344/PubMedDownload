the emergence resistance artemisinin derivatives southeast asia,
manifested delayed clearance plasmodium falciparum following treatment with
artemisinins, major concern. recently, artemisinin resistance phenotype 
was attributed mutations portions p. falciparum gene (pf3d7_1343700)
encoding kelch (k13) propeller domains, providing molecular marker monitor
the spread resistance. p. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 (fp2;
pf3d7_1115700) shown contribute artemisinin action, hemoglobin 
degradation required potent drug activity, stop mutation fp2 
gene identified parasites selected artemisinin resistance. although
delayed parasite clearance artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 
not yet noted uganda acts remain highly efficacious, characterizing
the diversity genes important assess potential resistance 
selection provide baseline future surveillance. therefore
sequenced k13-propeller domain fp2 gene p. falciparum isolates from
children previously treated act uganda, including samples 2006-7
(n = 49) 2010-12 (n = 175). using 3d7 reference genome, we
identified 5 non-synonymous polymorphisms k13-propeller domain (133
isolates) 35 fp2 (160 isolates); include polymorphisms
recently associated resistance vitro selection identified in
isolates asia. prevalence k13-propeller fp2 polymorphisms not
increase time, associated either time since prior receipt
of act persistence parasites ≥2 days following treatment an
act. thus, k13-propeller fp2 polymorphisms associated artemisinin
resistance prevalent uganda, see evidence selection
of polymorphisms genes.
