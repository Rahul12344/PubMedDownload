an ideal malaria vaccine platform potently induce protective immune
responses block parasite transmission mosquito human, should
maintain effects extended period. here, focused vaccine
development based adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (aav1), viral vector
widely studied field clinical gene therapy able induce
long-term transgene expression without causing toxicity vivo. results show
the potential utility aav1 vectors extremely potent booster vaccine to
induce durable immunity combined adenovirus-priming vaccine a
rodent malaria model. generated series recombinant aav1s human
adenovirus type 5 (adhu5) expressing either plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite protein (pfcsp) p25 (pfs25) protein. heterologous two-dose
immunization adhu5-prime aav1-boost (adhu5-aav1) elicited robust 
durable pfcsp- pfs25-specific functional antibodies 280 days. regarding
protective efficacy, adhu5-aav1 pfcsp achieved high sterile protection (up 80%
protection rate) challenge transgenic plasmodium berghei sporozoites
expressing pfcsp. examining transmission-blocking (tb) efficacy, found
that immunization adhu5-aav1 pfs25 maintained tb activity vivo against
transgenic p. berghei expressing pfs25 287 days (99% reduction oocyst
intensity, 85% reduction oocyst prevalence). data indicate aav1-based
malaria vaccines confer potent durable protection well tb efficacy 
when administered following adhu5 priming vaccine, supporting further
evaluation regimen clinical trials next-generation malaria
vaccine platform.
