the clinical complications malaria caused parasite expansion the
blood. invasion erythrocytes complex process depends multiple
receptor-ligand interactions. identification host receptors paramount for
fighting disease could reveal new intervention targets, the
enucleated nature erythrocytes makes genetic approaches impossible many
receptors remain unknown. host-parasite interactions evolve rapidly are
therefore likely species-specific. results, understanding invasion 
receptors outside major human pathogen plasmodium falciparum limited.
here use mouse embryonic stem cells (mescs) genetically engineered
and differentiated erythrocytes identify receptors rodent malaria
parasite plasmodium berghei. two proteins previously implicated human malaria 
infection: glycophorin c (gypc) band-3 (slc4a1) deleted mescs to
generate stable cell lines, differentiated towards erythropoiesis. 
vitro infection assays revealed deletion band-3 effect,
absence gypc results dramatic decrease invasion, demonstrating the
crucial role protein p. berghei infection. stem cell approach
offers possibility targeting genes may essential therefore
difficult disrupt whole organisms potential applied
