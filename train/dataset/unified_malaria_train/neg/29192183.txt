antimalarial drug resistance major global challenge malaria control and
elimination. mutations six different genes plasmodium falciparum (crt,
mdr1, dhfr, dhps, atpase6 k-13 propeller) confer resistance to
chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine artemisinin-based combination therapy
were analyzed samples chhattisgarh. seventy-eight percent samples 
were found pfcrt mutation (53% double, 24% triple 1% single
mutant), 59% pfmdr1 genes found n86y mutation. double
mutations recorded pfdhfr gene among 76% samples 6% 
the samples harbored mutant genotypes pfdhps. mutation found the
k-13 propeller gene, one sample showed mutant genotype the
pfatpase6 gene. tajima test confirmed role evolutionary
natural selection drug resistance, gene pairwise linkage disequilibrium
showed significant intragenic association. high level pfcrt mutations
suggests parasite resistance chloroquine almost fixed level,
whereas resistance sp evolving population parasites remain
sensitive artemisinin derivatives. findings provide potential
information understanding evolution spread different drug
resistance alleles chhattisgarh.
