over recent years, plethora new genetic tools transformed conditional
engineering malaria parasite genome, allowing functional dissection of
essential genes asexual sexual blood stages cause pathology or
are required disease transmission, respectively. important challenges remain,
including desirability complement conditional mutants correctly
regulated second gene copy confirm observed phenotypes due solely 
loss gene function analyse structure-function relationships. meet
this challenge, combine dimerisable cre (dicre) system use
of multiple lox sites simultaneously generate multiple recombination events of
the gene. focused plasmodium falciparum cgmp-dependent protein
kinase (pkg), creating parallel conditional disruption gene plus 
two allelic replacements. use approach demonstrate pkg no
scaffolding adaptor role intraerythrocytic development, acting solely at
merozoite egress. also show phosphorylation-deficient pkg is
functionally incompetent. method provides valuable new tools analysis 
gene function malaria parasite.
