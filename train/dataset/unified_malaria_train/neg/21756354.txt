background: plasmodium falciparum contains three genes encoding potential
glutamate dehydrogenases. protein encoded gdha previously been
biochemically structurally characterized. suggested is
important supply reducing equivalents intra-erythrocytic
development plasmodium and, therefore, suitable drug target.
methods: gene encoding nadp(h)-dependent gdha disrupted by
reverse genetics p. falciparum effect antioxidant metabolic
capacities resulting mutant parasites investigated.
results: growth defect low elevated oxygen tension, up- or
down-regulation number antioxidant nadp(h)-generating proteins or
mrnas increased levels gsh detected d10δgdha parasite
lines. further, fate carbon skeleton [13c] labelled glutamine was
assessed metabolomic studies, revealing differences labelling of
α-ketoglutarate tca pathway intermediates wild type mutant 
parasites.
conclusions: first, data support conclusion d10δgdha parasites are
not experiencing enhanced oxidative stress gdha function may 
provision nadp(h) reductive reactions. second, results imply 
cytosolic, nadp(h)-dependent gdha protein involved oxidative
deamination glutamate protein may play role ammonia
assimilation described nadp(h)-dependent gdh plants
and fungi. lack obvious phenotype absence gdha may point a
regulatory role protein providing glutamate (as nitrogen storage molecule)
in situations parasites experience limiting supply carbon sources 
and, therefore, vitro conditions enzyme unlikely of
significant importance. data imply protein suitable target 
for future drug development intra-erythrocytic parasite development.
