background: rna interference (rnai), facilitated functional
characterization mosquito neural development genes axon guidance
regulator semaphorin-1a (sema1a), could one day applied new means of
vector control. saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) may represent an
effective interfering rna expression system could used directly for
delivery rna pesticides mosquito larvae. describe characterization 
of yeast larvicide developed bioengineering s. cerevisiae express
a short hairpin rna (shrna) targeting conserved site mosquito sema1a genes.
results: experiments conducted aedes aegypti larvae demonstrated the
yeast larvicide effectively silences sema1a expression, generates severe neural
defects, induces high levels larval mortality laboratory,
simulated-field, semi-field experiments. larvicide also found to
induce high levels aedes albopictus, anopheles gambiae culex
quinquefasciatus mortality.
conclusions: results studies indicate use yeast interfering 
rna larvicides targeting mosquito sema1a genes may represent new biorational
tool mosquito control.
