the mosquito immune circulatory systems functionally integrated. during
an infection, hemocytes aggregate around ostia (valves) dorsal vessel 
- areas heart called periostial regions - phagocytose live 
and melanized pathogens. although periostial hemocyte aggregation immune
response occurs following infection bacteria malaria parasites, the
molecular basis process remains poorly understood. here, show the
thioester-containing proteins, tep1, tep3 tep4 positive regulators of
periostial hemocyte aggregation african malaria mosquito, anopheles
gambiae. rnai-based knockdown tep1, tep3 tep4 resulted fewer periostial
hemocytes following escherichia coli infection, without affecting adjacent
population non-periostial, sessile hemocytes. moreover, knockdown tep1,
tep3 tep4 expression resulted reduced bacterial accumulation melanin
deposition periostial regions. finally, study confirmed role that
tep1 plays reducing infection intensity hemocoel. overall, this
research shows complement-like proteins, tep1, tep3 tep4, are
positive regulators functional integration immune and
circulatory systems mosquitoes.
