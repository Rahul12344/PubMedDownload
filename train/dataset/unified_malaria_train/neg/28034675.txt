crispr/cas9 successfully adapted gene editing malaria parasites
including plasmodium falciparum plasmodium yoelii. however, reported
methods limited editing one gene time. practice, often
desired modify multiple genetic loci parasite genome. describe 
crispr/cas9 mediated genome editing method allows successive modification of
more one gene genome p. yoelii using improved single-vector
system (pycm) developed previously. drug resistant genes encoding human
dihydrofolate reductase (hdhfr) yeast bifunctional protein (yfcu), with
cytosine deaminase (cd) uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (uprt) activities
in plasmid, allowed sequential positive (pyrimethamine, pyr) negative
(5-fluorocytosine, 5fc) selections generation transgenic parasites free of
the episomal plasmid genetic modification. using system, able 
to efficiently tag gene interest (pyp28) subsequently disrupted two
genes (pyctrp pycdpk3) individually critical ookinete motility. 
disruption genes either eliminated (pyctrp) greatly reduced (pycdpk3)
ookinete forward motility matrigel vitro completely blocked oocyst
development mosquito midgut. method greatly facilitate studies of
parasite gene function, development, disease pathogenesis.
