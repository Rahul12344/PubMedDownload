background: artemisinin resistance, linked polymorphisms kelch gene 
chromosome 13 plasmodium falciparum (k13), outpaced containment efforts in
south east asia. national malaria control programmes region, is
important establish surveillance system includes monitoring k13
polymorphisms associated clinical phenotype.
methods: february december 2013, parasite clearance assessed in
35 patients uncomplicated p. falciparum treated artesunate monotherapy 
followed 3-day act isolated area myanmar-thai border with
relatively low artemisinin drug pressure. molecular testing k13 mutations was
performed dry blood spots collected admission.
results: proportion k13 mutations patients 41.7%, 5 
alleles detected: c580y, i205t, m476i, r561h, f446i. these, f446i was
the common, associated longer parasite clearance half-life
(median) 4.1 (min-max 2.3-6.7) hours compared 2.5 (min-max 1.6-8.7) in
wildtype (p = 0·01). prevalence k13 mutant parasites much lower than
the proportion k13 mutants detected 200 km south much less remote setting
where prevalence k13 mutants 84% 15 distinct alleles 2013 of
which c580y predominated.
conclusions: study provides evidence artemisinin resistance remote
part eastern myanmar. prevalence k13 mutations well allele
diversity varies considerably across short distances, presumably of
historical patterns artemisinin use population movements.
