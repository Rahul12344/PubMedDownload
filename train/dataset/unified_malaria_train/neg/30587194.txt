background: different mosquito-borne pathogens circulating iran including 
sindbis virus, west nile virus, filarioid worms malaria parasites. however,
the local transmission cycles pathogenic agents poorly understood,
especially ecological data vector species scarce is
limited knowledge host range; understanding could help direct
species-specific vector control measurements prioritize research.
methods: summers 2015 2016, blood-fed mosquitoes collected 
13 trapping sites coast caspian sea northern iran an
additional trapping site western iran. mosquitoes generally collected
with either biogents sentinel trap heavy duty encephalitis vector survey
trap installed outside. handheld aspirator used trapping site in
western iran, addition samplings around trapping sites. 
average, eight trapping periods conducted per trapping site. sources 
blood meals identified using dna barcoding approach targeting the
cytochrome b 16s rrna gene fragment.
results: source blood meals 580 blood-fed mosquito specimens 20
different taxa determined, resulting identification 13 different
host species (9 mammals including humans, 3 birds 1 reptile), whereby no
mixed blood meals detected. five mosquito species represented than
85.8% collected blood-fed specimens: culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens
(305 specimens, 55.7% mosquito specimens), cx. theileri (60, 10.9%), cx.
sitiens (51, 9.3%), cx. perexiguus (29, 5.3%) anopheles superpictus (25,
4.6%). commonly detected hosts four abundant mosquito
species humans (homo sapiens; 224 mosquito specimens, 40.9% mosquito 
specimens), cattle (bos taurus; 171, 31.2%) ducks (anas spp.; 75, 13.7%).
these four mosquito species similar host-feeding patterns. only
exceptions relatively high proportion birds cx. pipiens pipiens f. 
pipiens (23.2% detected blood meal sources) high proportion non-human
mammals cx. theileri (73.4%). trapping month, surrounding area, trapping
method statistically significant impact observed host-feeding
patterns cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens.
conclusions: due diverse overlapping host-feeding patterns, several
mosquito species must considered potential enzootic bridge vectors 
diverse mosquito-borne pathogens iran. species potentially transmit
pathogens mammals well mammals birds, might be
the result similar host selection high dependence host
availability.
