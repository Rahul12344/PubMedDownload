in tsetse flies, nutrients intrauterine larval development synthesized by
the modified accessory gland (milk gland) provided mother's milk during
lactation. interference least two milk proteins shown extend 
larval development reduce fecundity. goal study perform 
comprehensive characterization tsetse milk proteins using lactation-specific
transcriptome/milk proteome analyses define functional role(s) the
milk proteins lactation. differential analysis rna-seq data from
lactating dry (non-lactating) females revealed enrichment transcripts
coding protein synthesis machinery, lipid metabolism secretory proteins
during lactation. among genes induced lactation encoding
the previously identified milk proteins (milk gland proteins 1-3, transferrin and
acid sphingomyelinase 1) seven new genes (mgp4-10). genes encoding
mgp2-10 organized 40 kb syntenic block tsetse genome, have
similar exon-intron arrangements, share regions amino acid sequence
similarity. expression mgp2-10 female-specific high milk
secretion. knockdown single mgp failed reduce fecundity,
simultaneous knockdown multiple variants reduced milk protein levels and
lowered fecundity. genomic localization, gene structure similarities, and
functional redundancy mgp2-10 suggest constitute novel highly
divergent protein family. data indicates mgp2-10 function the
primary amino acid resource developing larva maintenance of
milk homeostasis, similar function mammalian casein family milk 
proteins. study underscores dynamic nature lactation cycle and
identifies novel family lactation-specific proteins, unique glossina sp.,
that essential larval development. specificity mgp2-10 tsetse
and critical role lactation suggests proteins may an
excellent target tsetse-specific population control approaches.
