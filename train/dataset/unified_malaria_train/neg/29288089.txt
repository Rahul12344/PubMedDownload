triatoma dimidiata, chagas disease vector widely distributed along central
america, great capability domestic adaptation majority of
specimens caught inside human dwellings peridomestic areas fed human blood.
exploring salivary compounds overcome host haemostatic immune
responses great scientific interest. here, provide deeper insight into
its salivary gland molecules. used high-throughput rna sequencing examine
in depth t. dimidiata salivary gland transcriptome. >51 million reads
assembled, 92.21% related putative secreted proteins. lipocalin the
most abundant gene family, confirming expanded family triatoma genus 
salivary repertoire. putatively secreted members include phosphatases,
odorant binding protein, hemolysin, proteases, protease inhibitors, antigen-5 and
antimicrobial peptides. work expands previous set functionally
annotated sequences t. dimidiata salivary glands available ncbi 388 
to 3815. additionally, complemented salivary analysis proteomics
(available data via proteomexchange identifier pxd008510), disclosing the
set complexity 119 secreted proteins validating transcriptomic
results. large-scale approach enriches pharmacologically active molecules
database improves knowledge complexity salivary compounds
from haematophagous vectors biological interactions.significance:
several haematophagous triatomine species transmit trypanosoma cruzi, the
etiological agent chagas disease. due reemergence disease, new 
drugs prevention treatment considered priorities. this
reason, knowledge vector saliva emerges relevant biological finding,
contributing design different strategies vector control disease
transmission. report transcriptomic proteomic compositions the
salivary glands (sialome) reduviid bug triatoma dimidiata, relevant
chagas disease vector central america. results robust disclosed
unprecedented insights notable diversity salivary glands content,
revealing relevant anti-haemostatic salivary gene families. work expands
almost ten times previous set functionally annotated sequences t.
dimidiata salivary glands available ncbi. moreover, using integrated
transcriptomic proteomic approach, showed correlation pattern of
transcription translation processes main gene families found, an
important contribution research triatomine sialomes. furthermore, data 
generated reinforces secreted proteins encountered greatly
contribute haematophagic habit, trypanosoma cruzi transmission and
development therapeutic agent studies.
