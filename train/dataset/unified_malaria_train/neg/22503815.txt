investigations genetic basis underlying antigenic variation malaria
parasites primarily described transcriptional regulation large,
multi-copy gene families encode red cell surface antigens. particular,
extensive alterations chromatin structure subnuclear localization have
been shown play key roles mutually exclusive expression, gene silencing and
activation, epigenetic memory. however mechanisms responsible the
generation sequence diversity within gene families, characteristic
that equally important parasite's ability avoid host's immune
response, remains poorly understood malaria. recent work model organisms
suggests mechanisms controlling gene activation silencing might also
contribute preferential recombination antigen encoding genes, thus
linking two key processes.
