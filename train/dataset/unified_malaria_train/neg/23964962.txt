background: plasmodium vivax widespread human malaria
parasites terms geography, thought present unique challenges to
local efforts aimed control elimination. parasite molecular markers can
provide much needed data p. vivax populations, markers 
critically evaluated. one marker seen extensive use gene encoding
merozoite surface protein 3-alpha (msp-3α), blood-stage antigen known be
highly variable among p. vivax isolates. here, sample complete msp-3α gene
sequences analysed order assess utility molecular marker for
epidemiologic investigations.
methods: amplification, cloning sequencing additional p. vivax isolates
from different geographic locations, including set venezuelan field isolates
(n = 10), yielded sample 48 complete msp-3α coding sequences.
characterization standard population genetic measures diversity,
phylogenetic analysis, tests recombination performed. allowed
comparisons patterns inferred silico simulation polymerase
chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) protocol used 
widely.
results: larger sample msp-3α diversity revealed incongruence 
observed levels nucleotide polymorphism, high populations,
and pattern pcr-rflp haplotype diversity. indeed, pcr-rflp haplotypes were
not informative population's genetic diversity identical haplotypes
could produced analogous bands commonly used protocol. evidence of
frequent variable insertion-deletion mutations recurrent recombination
between msp-3α haplotypes complicated inference genetic diversity patterns
and reduced phylogenetic signal.
conclusions: genetic diversity p. vivax msp-3α involves intragenic
recombination events. whereas high genetic diversity msp-3α makes a
promising marker epidemiological applications, ability msp-3α
pcr-rflp analysis accurately track parasites limited. local studies 
circulating alleles needed implementing pcr-rflp approaches.
furthermore, evidence global sample analysed suggests msp-3α
pcr-rflp methods suitable broad geographic studies tracking
parasite populations extended period time.
