background: plasmodium complex biology including ability interact
with host signals modulating function cellular machinery. tumor
necrosis factor (tnf) elicits diverse cellular responses including effects in
malarial pathology increased infected erythrocyte cytoadherence. tnf
levels raised plasmodium falciparum infection investigated
whether effect parasite asexual stage.
methods: flow cytometry, spectrofluorimetric determinations, confocal microscopy 
and pcr real time quantifications employed characterizing tnf induced
effects membrane integrity verified wheat germ agglutinin staining.
results: tnf able decrease intracellular parasitemia, involving calcium 
a second messenger pathway. parasites incubated 48 h tnf showed
reduced erythrocyte invasion. thus, tnf induced rises intracellular calcium
concentration, blocked prior addition purinergic receptor
agonists kn62 a438079, interfering intra- extracellular calcium
release thapsigargin egta (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid). importantly, 
expression pfpcna1 encodes plasmodium falciparum proliferating-cell 
nuclear antigen 1, decreased p. falciparum treatment tnf (tumor necrosis
factor) 6-bnz camp (n(6)-benzoyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate sodium
salt).
conclusions: potentially interesting data showing relevance of
calcium downregulating gene involved cellular proliferation, triggered by
tnf.
general significance: data show plasmodium may subvert immunological
system use tnf control proliferation within vertebrate
host.
