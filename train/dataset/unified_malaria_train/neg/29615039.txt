background: angolan government recommends three artemisinin-based
combinations treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria:
artemether-lumefantrine (al), artesunate-amodiaquine (asaq), and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp). due threat emerging anti-malarial 
drug resistance, important periodically monitor efficacy of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act). study evaluated these
medications' therapeutic efficacy benguela, lunda sul, zaire provinces.
methods: enrollment occurred march july 2017. study participants were
children p. falciparum monoinfection provincial capital.
participants received 3-day course quality-assured artemisinin-based
combination monitored 28 (al asaq arms) 42 days (dp arm).
each act assessed two provinces. primary study endpoints were: (1)
follow-up without complications (2) failure respond treatment or
development recurrent p. falciparum infection. parasites patient
experiencing recurrent infection genotyped differentiate new infection
from recrudescence persistent parasitaemia. parasites also analysed
for molecular markers associated act resistance.
results: 608 children enrolled study, 540 (89%) reached primary study
endpoint. parasitaemia cleared within 3 days medication administration 
all participants, early treatment failures observed. exclusion 
of reinfections, corrected efficacy al 96% (91-100%, 95% confidence
interval) zaire 97% (93-100%) lunda sul. corrected efficacy asaq
was 100% (97-100%) benguela 93% (88-99%) zaire. corrected efficacy 
of dp 100% (96-100%) benguela 100% lunda sul. mutations
associated artemisinin resistance identified pfk13 gene the
38 cases recurrent p. falciparum infection. 33 treatment failures the
al asaq arms carried pfmdr1 pfcrt mutations associated lumefantrine
and amodiaquine resistance, respectively, day failure.
conclusions: al, asaq, dp continue efficacious p. falciparum
malaria provinces angola. rapid parasite clearance absence of
genetic evidence artemisinin resistance consistent full
susceptibility artemisinin derivatives. periodic monitoring vivo drug
efficacy remains priority routine activity angola.
