while plasmodium falciparum known strong effect human
evolution, time period p. falciparum first infected ancestors modern 
humans remained uncertain. recent advances demonstrated p. falciparum
evolved ancestors gorilla parasites via host switching. here, estimate
the range dates host switch may occurred. dna sequences
of portions mitochondrial cytochrome b gene obtained gorilla
parasites closely related human p. falciparum aligned compared
against similar sequences human p. falciparum. time estimates were
calculated applying previously established parasite cytochrome b gene
mutation rate (0.012 mutations per site per million years) modeling
uncertainty monte-carlo simulation. estimate 95% confidence interval
for p. falciparum first infected ancestors modern humans 112,000
and 1,036,000 years ago (median estimate, 365,000 years ago). confidence
interval suggests p. falciparum first infected human ancestors much more
recently previous recognized estimate 2.5 million years ago. the
revised estimate may inform understanding certain aspects human-malaria
co-evolution. example, revised date suggests closer relationship
between entry p. falciparum humans appearance many red blood
cell polymorphisms considered genetic adaptations malaria. addition, 
the confidence interval lies within timeframe dating dawn homo
sapiens, suggesting p. falciparum may undergone host switching a
plasmodia adaptation specific species.
