the monoamine oxidase (maoa) gene important candidate gene human
behavior encodes enzyme regulating metabolism key
neurotransmitters. regulatory mechanisms maoa gene dogs yet 
be elucidated. measured maoa gene transcription analyzed vntr genotype
and methylation status gene promoter region different dog breeds to
determine whether maoa expression correlated maoa genotype or
epigenetic modification dogs. found brain-specific expression maoa
gene different transcription levels different dog breeds including beagle,
sapsaree, german shepherd, also robust association dna
methylation gene promoter mrna levels. however, 90 bp tandem
repeats observed near transcription start site variable,
indicating correlation canine maoa activity. results show that
differential dna methylation maoa promoter region may affect gene
expression modulating promoter activity. moreover, distinctive patterns of
maoa expression dna methylation may involved breed-specific or
individual behavioral characteristics, aggression, behavioral
phenotypes related different physiological neuroendocrine responses.
