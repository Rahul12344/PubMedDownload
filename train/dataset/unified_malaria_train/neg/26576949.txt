infection toxoplasma gondii leads massive changes host cell. here,
we identify novel host cell effector export pathway requires the
golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (asp5). demonstrate asp5 cleaves a
highly constrained amino acid motif similarity pexel-motif of
plasmodium parasites. show asp5 matures substrates n- and
c-terminal ends proteins also controls trafficking effectors without
this motif. furthermore, asp5 controls establishment nanotubular network
and required efficient recruitment host mitochondria the
vacuole. assessment host gene expression reveals asp5-dependent
pathway influences thousands transcriptional changes toxoplasma
imparts host cell. changes result attenuation virulence of
Î´asp5 tachyzoites vivo. work characterizes first identified machinery
required export toxoplasma effectors infected host cell.
