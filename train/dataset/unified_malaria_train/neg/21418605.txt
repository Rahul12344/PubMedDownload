background: genome number species malaria parasites (plasmodium
spp.) sequenced hope identifying new drug vaccine targets.
however, almost one-half predicted plasmodium genes annotated as
hypothetical difficult analyse bulk due inefficiency of
current reverse genetic methodologies plasmodium. recently, shown
that transposase piggybac integrates random genome human
malaria parasite p. falciparum offering possibility develop forward
genetic screens analyse plasmodium gene function. study reports the
development application piggybac transposition system rodent
malaria parasite p. berghei evaluation potential tool in
forward genetic studies. p. berghei frequently used malaria parasite 
model gene function analysis since phenotype screens throughout complete
plasmodium life cycle possible vitro vivo.
results: demonstrate piggybac based gene inactivation and
promoter-trapping easier efficient p. berghei the
human malaria parasite, p. falciparum. random piggybac-mediated insertion into
genes achieved parasites transfected piggybac donor
plasmid either transposase expressed either helper plasmid a
stably integrated gene genome. characterization 120 insertion
sites demonstrated 70 likely affect gene expression
classifying protein products non-essential asexual blood stage
development. non-essential nature two genes confirmed by
targeted gene deletion one encodes p41, ortholog human malaria
vaccine candidate. importantly future development whole genome phenotypic 
screens remobilization piggybac element parasites stably
express transposase demonstrated.
conclusion: data demonstrate piggybac behaved efficient and
random transposon p. berghei. remobilization piggybac element shows that
with development piggybac system effective tool generate
random genome-wide mutation parasite libraries, use large-scale phenotype 
screens vitro vivo.
