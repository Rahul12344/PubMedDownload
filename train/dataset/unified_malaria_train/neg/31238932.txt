background: reverse genetics approaches become powerful tools dissect the
biology malaria parasites. previous study, development vitro
drug selection method generating transgenic parasite plasmodium berghei
was reported. using method, two novel independent selection markers
using p. berghei heat shock protein 70 promoter previously established.
while approach permits easy flexible genetic manipulation p.
berghei, shortcomings include low variety promoter options drive marker
gene expression increased complexity selection procedure. this
study, addressing issues attempted.
methods: secure variety promoters, use p. berghei elongation
factor-1α promoter marker gene expression attempted. simplify the
procedure vitro selection, establishment two cell-cycle culture
method application drug selection attempted.
results: p. berghei elongation factor-1α (pbef-1α) promoter, is
commonly used drive marker gene expression, successfully applied an
alternative promoter model marker gene expression, using parasite's
codon-optimized marker sequence. simplify vitro selection method, two
cell-cycle culture method merozoite released filtration of
the culture containing matured schizont-infected erythrocytes also developed 
and successfully applied drug selection.
conclusion: pbef-1α promoter successfully applied vitro
selection system. vitro selection procedure also could simplified for
practical use using two cell-cycle culture method. improvements provide a
more versatile platform genetic manipulation p. berghei.
