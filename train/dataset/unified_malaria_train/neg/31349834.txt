background: large-scale surveillance molecular markers anti-malarial drug
resistance attractive method resistance monitoring, complement
therapeutic efficacy studies settings latter logistically
challenging.
methods: 2014 2017, study sampled malaria rapid diagnostic tests
(rdts), used routine clinical care, two health centres bissau,
guinea-bissau. order obtain epidemiological insights, rdts collected
together patient data age sex. subset positive rdts one 
the two sites (n = 2184) tested plasmodium dna content. testing
positive plasmodium dna pcr (n = 1390) used library preparation, 
custom designed dual indexing next generation miseq targeted sequencing of
plasmodium falciparum genes pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps pfk13.
results: study found high frequency pfmdr1 codon 86n 88-97%, a
significant decrease pfcrt wildtype cvmnk haplotype elevated levels of
the pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutant ranging 33 51% 2014 2017. 
no polymorphisms indicating artemisinin tolerance discovered. the
demographic data indicate large proportion young adults (66%, interquartile 
range 11-28 years) presenting p. falciparum infections. total of
5532 gene fragments successfully analysed single illumina miseq flow
cell, pcr-positivity library preparation varied considerably 13 
87% different amplicons. furthermore, pre-screening samples plasmodium
dna content proved necessary prior library preparation.
conclusions: study serves proof concept using leftover clinical 
material (used rdts) large-scale molecular surveillance, encompassing the
inherent complications regarding methodology analysis so.
factors rdt storage prior dna extraction parasitaemia the
infection likely effect whether parasite dna be
successfully analysed, considered part reason data yield is
suboptimal. however, given necessity molecular surveillance of
anti-malarial resistance settings poor infrastructure, poor economy,
lack educated staff even surges political instability remain major
obstacles performing clinical studies, obtaining necessary data used 
rdts, despite suboptimal output, becomes feasible, affordable hence a
justifiable method.
