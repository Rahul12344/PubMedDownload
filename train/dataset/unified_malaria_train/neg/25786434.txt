cytochemical staining remains efficient way identifying females are
heterozygous x chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
gene. g6pd highly polymorphic certain alleles resulting low
intracellular g6pd activity red blood cells. low intracellular g6pd activity
is associated risk severe hemolysis exposed oxidative stress
such fava beans, certain drugs infections. heterozygous females express
the enzyme x-chromosome alleles resulting two red blood cell
populations g6pd enzyme characteristics representative allele; 
for example, normal deficient. cytochemical staining way to
determine relative representation allele red blood cells, a
feature critical assessing risk severe hemolysis when
exposed oxidant anti-malarial drug primaquine. letter
discusses red blood cell integrity respect cytofluorometric assays
for g6pd activity. approach making test robust suggested. 
approach makes test reliable extends use broader range 
blood specimens.
