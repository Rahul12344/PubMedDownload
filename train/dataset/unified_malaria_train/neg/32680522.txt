background: plasmodium vivax malaria characterized presence dormant 
liver-stage parasites, called hypnozoites, cause malaria relapses after
an initial attack. primaquine, targets liver hypnozoites, must used in
combination schizonticidal agent get radical cure. however,
relapses sometimes occur spite correct treatment, due different
factors diminished metabolization primaquine.
case presentation: january 2019, 21 years old woman residence in
madrid, returning trip venezuela clinical symptoms compatible with
malaria infection, diagnosed vivax malaria. chloroquine 3 days plus 
primaquine 14 days elected treatment. two months later a
second trip venezuela, patient presented second p. vivax infection,
which treated previous one. third p. vivax malaria episode was
diagnosed 2 months later, returning trip morocco, receiving
chloroquine 3 days increasing 28 days primaquine regimen, with
no relapses 6 months follow up. genotyping p. vivax the
three malaria episodes revealed strain present different
relapses. upon confirmation correct adherence treatment,
non-description resistance infection area highly unlikely
re-infection subsequent trips stays spain, possible metabolic failure 
was considered. cyp2d6 encodes human cytochrome p450 isoenzyme 2d6 (cyp2d6), 
responsible primaquine activation. patient found a
cyp2d6*4/*1 genotype, turns intermediate metabolizer phenotype,
which related p. vivax relapses.
conclusions: impairment cyp2d6 enzyme could likely cause p.
vivax relapses patient. highlights importance considering the
analysis cyp2d6 gene polymorphisms cases p. vivax relapses a
correct treatment and, especially, considered study dosage
and duration primaquine treatment.
