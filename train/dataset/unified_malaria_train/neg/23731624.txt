background: simian malaria still open question concerning species of
plasmodium parasites species new world monkeys susceptible the
parasites. addition, lingering question whether animals are
reservoirs human malaria might become important especially scenario of
eradication disease. aid answers questions, monkeys
were surveyed malaria parasite natural infection amazonian state of
rondônia, brazil, state intense environmental alterations due human
activities, facilitated sampling animals.
methods: parasites detected identified dna blood monkeys, 
pcr primers 18s rrna, csp msp1 genes sequencing the
amplified fragments. multiplex pcr primers 18s rrna genes designed
for parasite species plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax, plasmodium
malariae/plasmodium brasilianum plasmodium simium.
results: overall infection rate 10.9% observed 20 184 monkey
specimens surveyed, mostly p. brasilianum. however, four specimens monkeys 
were found infected p. falciparum, two doubly infected p.
brasilianum p. falciparum. addition, species monkey family
aotidae, aotus nigriceps, firstly reported naturally infected p.
brasilianum. none monkeys surveyed found infected p. simium/p.
vivax.
conclusion: rate natural plasmodium infection monkeys brazilian 
state rondônia line previous surveys simian malaria the
amazon region. fact monkey species found previously
been described harbour malaria parasites indicates list monkey
species susceptible plasmodium infection yet completed. furthermore, 
finding monkeys region infected p. falciparum clearly indicates
parasite transfer humans animals. whether parasite be
transferred back humans persistent parasite monkeys the
wild efficient reservoirs disease, yet evaluated.
finding different species monkeys infected parasite species suggests
indeed animals act reservoirs human malaria.
