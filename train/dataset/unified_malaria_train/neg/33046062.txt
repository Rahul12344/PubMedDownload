background: emergence anti-malarial drug resistance perpetual increase 
malaria incidence necessitates development novel anti-malarials. histone
deacetylases (hdac) shown promising target malaria, despite 
this, hdac inhibitors clinical trials malaria treatment. this
can attributed poor pharmacokinetics, bioavailability selectivity
of hdac inhibitors.
methods: collection hdac inhibitors screened anti-malarial
activity, best candidate profiled parasite-killing kinetics,
growth inhibition sensitive multi-drug resistant (mdr) strains against
gametocytes. absorption, distribution, metabolism excretion pharmacokinetics 
(adme-pk) parameters fndr-20123 determined, vivo efficacy was
studied mouse model plasmodium falciparum infection.
results: compound library hdac inhibitors (180 number) screened for
anti-malarial activity, fndr-20123 potent candidate. the
compound shown inhibit plasmodium hdac ic50 31 nm human
hdac ic50 3 nm. ic50 obtained p. falciparum asexual
blood-stage assay 42 nm. compared atovaquone pyrimethamine, the
killing profiles fndr-20123 better atovaquone comparable to
pyrimethamine. ic50 values growth inhibition sensitive mdr
strains similar, indicating cross-resistance low risk
of resistance development. selected compound also active against
gametocytes, indicating potential transmission control: ic50 values being
190 nm male and > 5 µm female gametocytes. fndr-20123 stable
candidate human/mouse/rat liver microsomes (> 75% remaining post 2-h
incubation), exhibits low plasma protein binding (57% humans) human
ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg) liability (> 100 µm), inhibit 
of cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoforms tested (ic50 > 25 µm). also shows
negligible cytotoxicity hepg-2 thp-1 cell lines. oral pharmacokinetics
in rats 100 mg/kg body weight shows good exposures (cmax = 1.1 µm) and
half-life (t1/2 = 5.5 h). furthermore, 14-day toxicokinetic study 100 mg/kg 
daily dose show abnormality body weight gross organ pathology. 
fndr-20123 also able reduce parasitaemia significantly mouse model for
p. falciparum infection dosed orally subcutaneously.
conclusion: fndr-20123 may suitable candidate treatment malaria, 
which developed.
