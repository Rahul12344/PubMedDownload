a transmission-blocking vaccine targeting sexual stages plasmodium species
could play key role eradicating malaria. multiple studies identified
the p. falciparum proteins pfs25 pfs48/45 prime targets for
transmission-blocking vaccines. although significant advances made in
recombinant expression antigens, remain difficult produce at
large scale lack strong immunogenicity subunit antigens. linked a
self-assembling protein, granule lattice protein 1 (grl1p), ciliated
protozoan, tetrahymena thermophila, regions ectodomains either pfs25
or pfs48/45. found resulting protein chimera could produced e. coli
as nanoparticles could readily purified soluble form. produced in
the e. coli shuffle strain, fusion grl1p dramatically increased solubility 
target antigens time directing formation particles 
diameters centering 38 25 nm depending antigen. number of
instances, co-expression chaperone proteins induction lower
temperature increased expression solubility. based western
blotting elisa analysis, pfs25 pfs48/45 retained their
transmission-blocking epitopes within e. coli-derived particles, the
particles elicited strong antibody responses rabbits given
with aluminum-based adjuvant. antibodies pfs25-containing
nanoparticles blocked parasite transmission standard membrane-feeding assays. 
in conclusion, fusion grl1p act solubility enhancer proteins with
limited solubility retaining correct folding, may useful for
applications production vaccines biologics.
