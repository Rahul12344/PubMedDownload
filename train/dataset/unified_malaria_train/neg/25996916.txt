a better understanding human-to-mosquito transmission crucial control
malaria. order assess factors associated gametocyte carriage, 2083
samples collected cross-sectional survey papua new guinea.
plasmodium species detected light microscopy qpcr gametocytes 
detection pfs25 pvs25 mrna transcripts reverse-transcriptase pcr
(qrt-pcr). parasite prevalence pcr 18.5% plasmodium falciparum and
13.0% p. vivax. 52.5% infections submicroscopic. gametocytes were
detected 60% p. falciparum-positive 51% p. vivax-positive samples.
each 10-fold increase parasite density led 1.8-fold 3.3-fold increase
in odds carrying p. falciparum p. vivax gametocytes. thus the
proportion gametocyte positive gametocyte densities highest young
children carrying high asexual parasite densities symptomatic individuals.
dilution series gametocytes allowed absolute quantification gametocyte
densities qrt-pcr showed pvs25 expression 10-20 fold lower than
pfs25 expression. 2006 2010 parasite prevalence study site has
decreased half. 90% remaining infections asymptomatic likely
constitute important reservoir transmission. however, mean gametocyte
densities low (approx. 1-2 gametocyte/Î¼l) remains determined to
what extent low-density gametocyte positive individuals infective to
mosquitos.
