malaria global disease clinically affects two hundred million
people annually. despite availability effective antimalarials, mortality
rates associated severe complications high. hepatopathy frequently
observed patients severe malarial disease pathogenesis poorly 
understood. previously, observed high amounts hemozoin malaria pigment
in livers infected mice. study, investigated whether hemozoin 
associated liver injury different mouse malaria models. c57bl/6j mice
infected rodent parasites plasmodium berghei anka, p. berghei nk65 p.
chabaudi elevated serum liver enzymes without severe histological changes 
in liver, line observations patients. furthermore, liver 
enzymes significantly higher serum p. chabaudi as-infected mice
compared mice infected p. berghei parasite strains strong
positive correlation found hepatic hemozoin levels, hepatocyte damage
and inflammation liver p. chabaudi as. observed liver injury 
only marginally influenced genetic background host, since similar
serum liver enzyme levels measured infected c57bl/6j balb/c mice.
intravenous injection p. falciparum-derived hemozoin malaria-free c57bl/6j 
mice induced inflammatory gene transcription liver, suggesting that
hemozoin may involved pathogenesis malaria hepatopathy inducing
inflammation.
