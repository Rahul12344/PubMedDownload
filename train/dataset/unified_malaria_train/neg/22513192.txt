background: honduras tropical country 70% population
living risk infected either plasmodium vivax plasmodium
falciparum. laboratory diagnosis important factor adequate
treatment management malaria. honduras, malaria diagnosed both,
microscopy rapid diagnostic tests date, molecular methods been
implemented routine diagnosis. however, since mixed infections, and
asymptomatic low-parasitaemic cases difficult detect light
microscopy alone, identifying appropriate molecular tools diagnostic
applications honduras deserves study. present study investigated
the utility different molecular tests diagnosis malaria in
honduras.
methods: total 138 blood samples collected part clinical trial to
assess efficacy chloroquine used: 69 microscopically confirmed p.
falciparum positive samples obtained day enrollment 69 follow-up
samples obtained 28 days chloroquine treatment shown malaria
negative microscopy. sensitivity specificity microscopy compared to
an 18 ribosomal rna gene-based nested pcr, two single-pcr reactions designed to
detect plasmodium falciparum infections, one single-pcr detect plasmodium
vivax infections, one multiplex one-step pcr reaction detect parasite
species.
results: 69 microscopically positive p. falciparum samples, 68 were
confirmed p. falciparum-positive two molecular tests used. the
one sample detected p. falciparum molecular tests shown 
to p. vivax-positive reference molecular test indicating misdiagnosis
by microscopy. reference molecular test detected five cases p. vivax/p.
falciparum mixed infections, recognized microscopy mixed
infections. two mixed infections recognized multiplex
test p. vivax-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected three 
them. addition, one day 28 samples, previously determined malaria
negative microscopy, shown p. vivax-positive three the
molecular tests specific parasite.
conclusions: molecular tests valuable tools confirmation of
plasmodium species detecting mixed infections malaria endemic regions.
