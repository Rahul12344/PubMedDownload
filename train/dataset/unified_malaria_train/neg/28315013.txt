epigenetic mechanisms dna methylation increasingly recognized be
critical vaccination efficacy outcome different infectious diseases,
but corresponding information scarcely available host defense against
malaria. experimental blood-stage malaria plasmodium chabaudi, we
investigate possible effects blood-stage vaccine dna methylation of
gene promoters liver, known effector blood-stage malaria, using
dna methylation microarrays. naturally susceptible balb/c mice acquire, by
protective vaccination, potency survive p. chabaudi malaria and,
concomitantly, modifications constitutive dna methylation promoters of
numerous genes liver; specifically, promoters 256 genes hyper(=up)-
and 345 genes hypo(=down)-methylated (p < 0.05). protective vaccination also 
leads changes promoter dna methylation upon challenge p. chabaudi at
peak parasitemia day 8 post infection (p.i.), 571 1013 gene promoters
are up- down-methylated, respectively, relation constitutive dna
methylation (p < 0.05). gene set enrichment analyses reveal vaccination
and p. chabaudi infections mainly modify promoters genes 
statistically enriched functions relating regulation transcription.
genes down-methylated promoters encompass encoding cx3cl1, gp130, 
gata2, known involved monocyte recruitment, il-6 trans-signaling, and
onset erythropoiesis, respectively. data suggest vaccination may
epigenetically improve parts several effector functions liver against
blood-stage malaria, as, e.g., recruitment monocyte/macrophage liver
accelerated liver regeneration extramedullary hepatic erythropoiesis, thus
leading self-healing otherwise lethal p. chabaudi blood-stage malaria.
