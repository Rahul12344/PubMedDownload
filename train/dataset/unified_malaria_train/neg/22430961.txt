despite efforts reduce malaria morbidity mortality, drug-resistant
parasites continue evade control strategies. recently, emphasis shifted
away control toward regional elimination global eradication of
malaria. campaign requires tools monitor genetic changes the
parasite could compromise effectiveness antimalarial drugs and
undermine eradication programs. tools must fast, sensitive, unambiguous,
and cost-effective offer real-time reports parasite drug susceptibility
status across globe. developed validated set genotyping
assays using high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis detect molecular
biomarkers associated drug resistance across six genes plasmodium
falciparum. improved existing technical approaches developing
refinements extensions hrm, including use blocked probes
(lunaprobes) mutant allele amplification bias (maab) technique. to
validate sensitivity accuracy assays, compared findings 
sequencing results culture-adapted lines clinical isolates from
senegal. demonstrate assays (i) identify known novel
polymorphisms, (ii) detect multiple genotypes indicative mixed infections, and
(iii) distinguish variants multiple copies locus present.
these rapid inexpensive assays track drug resistance detect emerging 
mutations targeted genetic loci p. falciparum. provide tools for
monitoring molecular changes associated changes drug response across
populations determining whether parasites present drug treatment
are result recrudescence reinfection clinical settings.
