background: spleen plays pivotal role rapid clearance parasitized
red blood cells patients falciparum malaria artemisinin treatment. 
prolonged parasite clearance found patients splenectomy,
or hemoglobin abnormalities and/or reduced immunity, all
distinguishable artemisinin resistance. paper reports case of
prolonged parasite clearance chinese splenectomized patient falciparum 
malaria imported nigeria.
case presentation: 35-year-old chinese male suffered 2 days febrile illness 
after returning zhumadian city henan province nigeria october 1,
2014. main symptoms febrile, including highest axillary temperature 
of 40 °c, headache, chills. peripheral blood smear showed parasitemia (53
913 asexual parasites/μl) plasmodium falciparum. patient used 
chemoprophylaxis malaria nigeria worked a
construction worker 2009 2014. patient three episodes of
malaria nigeria splenectomy due traffic accident 8 years ago
from time admitted hospital. patient orally administrated a
total 320 mg/2.56 g dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 2 days and
intravenously administrated total 3 000 mg artesunate 18 days. the
axillary temperature patient ranged 37.0 37.7 °c day 0 to
day 3, blood microscopy revealed falciparum malaria parasitemia (26 674
asexual parasites/μl) day 3. patient afebrile day 4, falciparum
malaria parasitemia continuously present gradually decreased 
next days, negative day 21. patient cured left hospital on
day 24 plasmodium falciparum found blood day 21 day 23.
no mutation found k13 propeller gene compared the
pf3d7_1343700 k13 propeller gene reference sequence.
conclusions: first reported case china prolonged parasite
clearance splenectomized patient imported falciparum malaria.
artemisinin resistance distinguished prolonged parasite clearance 
is found malaria patient splenectomy.
