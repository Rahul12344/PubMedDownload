background: babesia divergens common blood parasite europe causing
babesiosis, tick-borne malaria-like disease. despite increasing focus b. 
divergens, especially regarding veterinary human medicine, sexual
development babesia poorly understood. development babesia sexual stages
in host blood (gametocytes) plays decisive role parasite acquisition 
the tick vector. however, exact mechanism gametocytogenesis still
unexplained.
methods: babesia divergens gametocytes characterized expression bdccp1,
bdccp2 bdccp3 genes. using previously described sequences bdccp1, bdccp2
and bdccp3, established quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) assay 
detection assessment efficiency b. divergens gametocytes production
in bovine blood. analysed fluctuations expression bdccp genes during
cultivation vitro, well cultures treated different drugs and
stimuli.
results: demonstrated b. divergens clonal lines tested, originally
derived naturally infected cows, exhibited sexual stages. furthermore,
sexual commitment stimulated continuous growth cultures, by
addition specific stress-inducing drugs alternating cultivation
conditions. expression bdccp genes greatly reduced even lost after
long-term cultivation, suggesting possible problems artificial infections 
of ticks feeding assays vitro.
conclusions: research provides insight sexual development b.
divergens may facilitate development transmission models vitro,
enabling detailed understanding babesia-tick interactions.
