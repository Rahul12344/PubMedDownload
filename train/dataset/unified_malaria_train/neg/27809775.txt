background: malaria parasites genus plasmodium possess large
hyper-variable families antigen-encoding genes. often
variantly-expressed major virulence factors immune evasion the
maintenance chronic infections. recombination diversification these
gene families occurs readily, may promoted g-quadruplex (g4) dna motifs
within close variant genes. g4s shown cause replication
fork stalling, dna breakage recombination model systems, motifs 
remain largely unstudied plasmodium.
results: examined nature distribution putative g4-forming sequences
in multiple plasmodium genomes, finding co-distribution variant
gene families conserved across different plasmodium species have
different types variant gene families. p. falciparum, large set 
recombination events occurred time cultured parasites been
mapped, found strong spatial association recombination events 
and putative g4-forming sequences. finally, searched plasmodium genomes for
the three classes helicase unwind g4s: plasmodium spp. no
identifiable homologue highly efficient g4 helicase pif1, do
encode two putative recq helicases one homologue rad3-family helicase 
fancj.
conclusions: analyses, conducted whole-genome level multiple
species plasmodium, support concept g4s likely involved 
recombination diversification antigen-encoding gene families this
important protozoan pathogen.
