with intention investigating dna strand displacement properties of
plasmodium falciparum helicase pfeif4a (formerly known pfh45) a
codon-optimized gene expression escherichia coli produced.
several histidine-containing proteins intrinsic helicase activity were
captured bacterial sonicate initial ni(2+)-chromatography. heparin
and size-exclusion steps subsequently required unambiguous pfeif4a
purification. strategy generated active recombinant protein of
significantly improved yield comparison previously published studies (~4.2 
mg/g wet weight cells). helicase unwinding assays confirmed bipolar
activity, revealed preference unwinding free 3'-end, rate of
displacement 3'-5' direction 2-fold higher 5'-3'
direction. dna constructs two, three four blunt ends unwound.
studies confirmed enzyme mg(2+)-dependent, optimally active 37°c and
had background atp turnover rate 23.16±1.74 pmol/min, presence 
of single- double-stranded dna doubled 42.92±3.21 pmol/min.
