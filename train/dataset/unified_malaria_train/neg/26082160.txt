background: anopheles culicifacies s.l. one primary vectors malaria 
in india responsible highest number malaria cases. vector is
resistant ddt parts country indication emerging
resistance pyrethroids. since knockdown resistance (kdr) known confer
cross-resistance ddt pyrethroids owing common target site of
action, knowledge prevalence knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles is
important insecticide resistance management point view.
methods: nine populations an. culicifacies belonging five states india, 
representing northern, western central-east india, screened the
presence two alternative kdr mutations l1014f l1014s using pcr-based
assays. dead alive mosquitoes, following standard insecticide
susceptibility test deltamethrin ddt, tested allelic
association.
results: l1014f mutation recorded populations studied except from
haryana rajasthan states northern india, low frequencies ranging
between 0.012 0.076; whereas presence l1014s mutation recorded five
populations belonging central-east india, allelic frequencies
ranging 0.010 0.046. kdr mutant alleles found mostly in
heterozygous condition without deviating hardy-weinberg equilibrium. both
mutations showed protection deltamethrin whereas l1014s mutation
showed protection ddt tested using additive model.
conclusions: two l1014-kdr mutations, l1014f l1014s, co-occurred five 
populations belonging chhattisgarh odisha states india whereas l1014f
was present populations studied except populations northern states.
both kdr mutations found low allelic frequencies mostly in
heterozygous condition exhibited protection deltamethrin.
