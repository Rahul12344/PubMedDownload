modifications gene expression determine many phenotypic
differentiations closely related species. particularly evident in
reproductive tissues, evolution genes rapid, facilitating the
appearance distinct reproductive characteristics may lead species
isolation phenotypic variation. large-scale, comparative analyses of
transcript expression levels limited recently lack of
inter-species data mining solutions. here, combining expression normalisation 
across lineages, multivariate statistical analysis, evolutionary rate, and
protein-protein interaction analysis, investigate ortholog transcripts 
male accessory glands testes across five closely related species the
anopheles gambiae complex. first demonstrate differentiation by
transcript expression consistent known anopheles phylogeny. then,
through clustering, discover groups transcripts tissue-dependent
expression patterns conserved across lineages, lineage-dependent patterns
conserved across tissues. strongest associations reproductive function, 
transcriptional regulatory networks, protein-protein subnetworks, and
evolutionary rate found groups transcripts featuring large
expression differences lineage tissue-conserved patterns.
