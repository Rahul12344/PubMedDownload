coenzyme q (coq, ubiquinone) central electron carrier mitochondrial
respiration. coq synthesized multiple steps involving number of
different enzymes. prevailing view coq used respiration exists as
a free pool diffuses throughout mitochondrial inner membrane bilayer has
recently challenged. yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion 
gene encoding coq10p results respiration deficiency without inhibiting the
synthesis coq, suggesting coq10 protein critical delivery 
of coq site(s) respiration. precise mechanism is
achieved remains unknown present. identified plasmodium orthologue
of coq10 (pfcoq10), predominantly expressed trophozoite-stage
parasites, localizes parasite mitochondrion. expression pfcoq10 
the s. cerevisiae coq10 deletion strain restored capability yeast to
grow respiratory substrates, suggesting remarkable functional conservation
of protein vast evolutionary distance, despite relatively low
level amino acid sequence identity. antimalarial drug atovaquone acts
as competitive inhibitor coq, assessed whether over-expression pfcoq10
altered atovaquone sensitivity parasites yeast mitochondria, but
found alteration activity.
