background: amplified copy number plasmepsin ii/iii genes within
plasmodium falciparum associated decreased sensitivity to
piperaquine. examine association test whether additional loci might
also contribute, performed genome-wide association study ex vivo p.
falciparum susceptibility piperaquine.
methods: plasmodium falciparum dna 183 samples collected primarily from
cambodia genotyped 33716 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps). linear mixed models random forests used estimate associations
between parasite genotypes piperaquine susceptibility. candidate
polymorphisms evaluated association with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment outcomes independent dataset.
results: single nucleotide polymorphisms multiple chromosomes associated 
with piperaquine 90% inhibitory concentrations (ic90) genome-wide analysis. 
fine-mapping genomic regions implicated genome-wide analyses identified
multiple snps linkage disequilibrium significantly
associated piperaquine ic90, including novel mutation within gene
encoding p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, pfcrt. this
mutation (f145i) associated dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment
failure adjusting presence amplified plasmepsin ii/iii, which
was also associated decreased piperaquine sensitivity.
conclusions: data suggest that, addition plasmepsin ii/iii copy number,
other loci, including pfcrt, may also involved piperaquine resistance.
