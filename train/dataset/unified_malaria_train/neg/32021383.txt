purpose: pharmacogenes influence biotransformation pathway and
clinical outcome primaquine chloroquine often prescribed to
treat plasmodium vivax infection. genetic variation may impact enzyme activity
and/or transporter function thereby contribute relapse. aim the
study assess allele, genotype frequencies association between
pharmacogenes variation primaquine response thai patients infected with
plasmodium vivax.
patients methods: fifty-one patients genotyped 74 variants 18
genes sequenom massarray® taqman® snp real-time pcr.
results: snp frequencies significantly different relapse (n=4)
and non-relapse (n=47) patients. however, cyp2c19 c.681g>a, frequency 
the a-allele defines non-functional cyp2c19*2 haplotype was
significantly higher compared g-allele (or=5.14, p=0.021). patients
heterozygous abcg2 c.421c>a higher odds ratio (or=8.75, p=0.071) and
the frequency g-allele ugt2b7 c.372g>a higher compared the
a-allele (or=3.75, p=0.081). cyp2c19, abcg2 ugt2b7 emerged potential high 
priority genes.
conclusion: decreased activity cyp2c19, abcg2 ugt2b7 combination with
cyp2d6 intermediate poor metabolizer status may expose patients higher
risk plasmodium vivax relapse. investigations warranted to
substantiate findings.
