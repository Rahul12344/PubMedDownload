the aim work define cause sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp)
treatment failure plasmodium falciparum infections malaria-endemic zone
of india. samples collected 176 patients kolkata november 2008 
to july 2009. vitro susceptibility testing performed isolates.
parasite dna extracted, pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(rflp) analysis different codons dhfr gene (16, 51, 59, 108 164)
and dhps gene (436, 437, 540, 581 613) performed. finally, sequencing of
the products performed confirm mutations. vivo treatment
response sp among 176 patients determined. novel mutation of
isoleucine observed codon 108 dhfr gene, highly
correlated vitro sp resistance well early treatment failure. a
double dhfr mutation (108i+51i) observed 77.3% isolates, triple
mutation dhps gene observed 18.2% isolates. endemic
zone, sp treatment failure due novel dhfr mutation (108i+51i) one
of dhps mutations (s436a, a437g, a581g a613t/s). increase these
mutations highly correlated sp resistance (p < 0.0001).
