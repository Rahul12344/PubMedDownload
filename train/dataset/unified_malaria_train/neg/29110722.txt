background: drug resistance one greatest challenges malaria control 
programmes, monitoring parasite resistance artemisinins to
artemisinin combination therapy (act) partner drugs critical elimination
efforts. markers resistance wide panel antimalarials assessed 
natural parasite populations southwestern cameroon.
methods: individuals asymptomatic parasitaemia uncomplicated malaria were
enrolled cross-sectional surveys may 2013 march 2014 along the
slope mount cameroon. plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemic blood,
screened light microscopy, depleted leucocytes using cf11 cellulose
columns parasite genotype ascertained sequencing illumina hiseq
platform.
results: total 259 participants enrolled study three
different altitudes. alleles associated drug resistance in
pfdhfr, pfmdr1 pfcrt highly prevalent, less 3% samples
carried mutations pfkelch13 gene, none amongst those
associated slow artemisinin parasite clearance rates southeast asia. 
most prevalent haplotypes triple mutants pfdhfr 51 r 59 n 108 164(99%), 
pfcrt- c72v73 74 e 75 76 (47.3%), single mutants pfdhpss436 g
437k540a581a613(69%) pfmdr1 n86 f 184d1246 (53.2%).
conclusions: predominance pf pfcrt cviet pf dhfr irn triple mutant
parasites absence pfkelch13 resistance alleles suggest the
amodiaquine pyrimethamine components as-aq sp may longer be
effective role chloroquine resistance still persists in
southwestern cameroon.
