development protective immunity plasmodium falciparum partially
mediated binding malaria-specific igg fc gamma (γ) receptors.
variations human fcγriia-h/r-131 fcγriiib-na1/na2 affect differential
binding igg sub-classes. since variability fcγr may play important role 
in severe malarial anemia (sma) pathogenesis mediating phagocytosis red
blood cells triggering cytokine production, relationship between
fcγriia-h/r131 fcγriiib-na1/na2 haplotypes susceptibility sma
(hb < 6.0 g/dl) investigated kenyan children (n = 528) acute malaria 
residing holoendemic p. falciparum transmission region. addition, the
association carriage haplotypes repeated episodes sma and
all-cause mortality investigated 3-year follow-up period. since
variability fcγr alter interferon (ifn)-γ production, mediator innate
and adaptive immune responses, functional associations haplotypes and
ifn-γ also explored. acute malaria, children sma elevated
peripheral ifn-γ levels (p = 0.006). although multivariate logistic regression
analyses (controlling covariates) revealed associations fcγr
haplotypes susceptibility sma acute infection, the
fcγriia-131h/fcγriiib-na1 haplotype associated decreased peripheral
ifn-γ (p = 0.046). longitudinal analyses showed carriage the
fcγriia-131h/fcγriiib-na1 haplotype associated reduced risk sma (rr
0.65, 95% ci 0.46-0.90; p = 0.012) all-cause mortality (p = 0.002). in
contrast, carriers fcγriia-131h/fcγriiib-na2 haplotype increased
susceptibility sma (rr 1.47, 95% ci 1.06-2.04; p = 0.020). results here
demonstrate variation fcγr gene alters susceptibility repeated
episodes sma mortality, well functional changes ifn-γ production.
