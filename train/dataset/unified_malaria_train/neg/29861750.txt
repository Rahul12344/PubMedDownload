the study aims determine association malaria infection abo blood
groups genotype also detect point mutations positions 86, 184,
1034, 1042 plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene (pfmdr1) in
blood samples collected pregnant women attending general hospital minna. out
of 250 pregnant women screened, 39 (15.60%) malaria infection. prevalence was
higher women, third trimester (46.15%), genotype aa (64.10%), o
blood group (53.84%) individuals compared others. significant
(p < 0.05) decrease packed cell volume (pcv), hemoglobin (hgb), red blood
cells (rbc), platelet (plc) count infected group compared with
noninfected group. although, two isolates showed disrupted protein
sequence codon 1034-1042, mutation found p. falciparum
isolates. structural prediction chemical ligand led identification of
neu5acα2-3galβ1-3/β1-4glc/glcnac. compound theoretically bind change
the functional integrity pfmdr1 protein, thus providing new window for
malaria drug target.
