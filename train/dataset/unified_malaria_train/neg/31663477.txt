background: shown curcumin (cur) anti-plasmodial activity;
however, weak bioavailability, rapid metabolism, limited chemical
stability restricted application clinical usages. nanostructured
lipid carriers (nlcs) type drug-delivery systems (ddss) whose core
matrix composed solid liquid lipids.
objective: aim current study prepare characterize
curcumin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (cur-nlc) malaria treatment.
methods: producing nlc, coconut oil cetyl palmitate selected a
liquid solid lipid, respectively. order prepare cur-nlc, the
microemulsion method applied. general toxicity assay artemia salina as
well hemocompatibility investigated. anti-plasmodial activity studied 
on mice infected plasmodium berghei.
results: nlcs mean particle size polydispersity index (pi) 145 nm
and 0.3, respectively. further, zeta potential cur-nlc -25 mv. the
nlcs indicated pseudo-spherical shape observed via transmission electron
microscopy (tem). loading capacity encapsulation efficacy obtained
cur-nlc 3.1 ± 0.015% 74 ± 3.32%, respectively. vitro, cur release
profiles showed sustained-release pattern 5 days synthesized
cur-nlc. results vivo antiplasmodial activity p. berghei
revealed antimalarial activity cur-nlc significantly higher compared 
with free cur dose 40 mg/kg/day.
conclusion: results study suggested nlc would used a
potential nanocarrier treatment malaria.
