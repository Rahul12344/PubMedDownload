the goal prevent plasmodium falciparum transmission humans mosquitoes 
requires identification targetable metabolic processes mature
(stage v) gametocytes, sexual stages circulating bloodstream. this
task complicated apparently low metabolism cells, which
renders refractory antimalarial inhibitors constrains the
development specific sensitive cell-based assays. here, identify and
functionally characterize regulatory regions p. falciparum gene
pf3d7_1234700, encoding cpw-wpc protein named upregulated late
gametocytes (ulg8), leveraged express reporter genes mature
male female gametocytes. using transgenic parasites containing a
pfulg8-luciferase cassette, investigated susceptibility stage v
gametocytes compounds specifically affecting redox metabolism. results
reveal high sensitivity mature gametocytes glutathione reductase
inhibitor redox cycler drug methylene blue (mb). using isobologram analysis, 
we find concomitant inhibition parasite enzyme glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase-6-phosphogluconolactonase, key component nadph synthesis,
potently synergizes mb activity. data suggest redox metabolism and
detoxification activity play unsuspected yet vital role stage v
gametocytes, rendering cells exquisitely sensitive decreases nadph
concentration.
