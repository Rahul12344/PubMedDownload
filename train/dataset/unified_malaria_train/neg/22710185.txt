this review describes european-funded project area synthetic biology.
the project seeks demonstrate application engineering techniques and
methodologies design construction biosensor detecting
drug-target interactions single-molecule level. production proteins
required system followed principle previously described "bioparts"
concepts (a system database biological parts - promoters, genes,
terminators, linking tags cleavage sequences - used construct novel
gene assemblies) cassette-type assembly gene expression systems (the
concept linking different "bioparts" produce functional "cassettes"), but
problems quickly identified approaches. dna substrates the
device also constructed using cassette-system. finally, micro-engineering 
was used build magnetoresistive magnetic tweezer device detection of
single molecule dna modifying enzymes (motors), possibility of
constructing hall effect version device explored. device is
currently used study helicases plasmodium potential targets 
anti-malarial drugs, also suggest potential uses device.
