artemisinin related compounds (artemisinins), frontline treatment for
malaria, used save millions lives. potential application in
cancer treatment promising. nevertheless, precise mechanisms action 
artemisinins still controversial. particular, system-level influence
of artemisinins protein interactions regulatory networks remains unknown, 
limiting progress development class compounds anticancer drugs. 
in present study, investigated mechanism action artemisinins 
cancer therapy analysis based biological networks. according to
experimental evidence 400 literature studies, 558 key proteins
were derived artemisinins-rewired protein interaction network was
constructed. topological properties analyzed show protein
network scale-free biological system. modularity analysis and
pathway identification performed. five key pathways including pi3k-akt, t
cell receptor, toll-like receptor, tgf-beta insulin signaling pathways were
involved artemisinins-mediated anticancer effects; identification was
confirmed microarray data. based results, predictions made about
the targets artemisinins various pathways. results provide deeper
understanding molecular mechanisms action artemisinins will
contribute development application class compounds in
cancer treatment.
