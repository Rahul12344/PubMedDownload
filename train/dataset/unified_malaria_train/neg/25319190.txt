background: polymorphism antigens common mechanism immune evasion
used many important pathogens, presents major challenges vaccine
development. malaria, many key immune targets vaccine candidates show
substantial polymorphism. however, knowledge antigenic diversity key
antigens, impact polymorphism potential vaccine escape, how
sequence polymorphism relates antigenic differences limited, yet
crucial vaccine development. plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 
(ama1) important target naturally-acquired antibodies malaria
immunity leading vaccine candidate. however, ama1 extensive allelic
diversity 60 polymorphic amino acid residues 200
haplotypes single population. therefore, ama1 serves excellent model
to assess antigenic diversity malaria vaccine antigens feasibility 
multi-allele vaccine approaches. previous research focused on
sequence diversity antibody responses laboratory animals, little 
done cross-reactivity human antibodies.
methods: aimed determine extent antigenic diversity ama1, defined
by reactivity human antibodies, aid identification specific
alleles potential inclusion multi-allele vaccine. developed an
approach using multiple-antigen-competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) examine cross-reactivity naturally-acquired antibodies papua new
guinea kenya, related differences ama1 sequence.
results: found adults greater cross-reactivity antibodies than
children, although patterns cross-reactivity alleles same.
patterns antibody cross-reactivity similar populations
(papua new guinea kenya), time. further, results show that
antigenic diversity ama1 alleles surprisingly restricted, despite extensive
sequence polymorphism. findings suggest combination three different
alleles, selected appropriately, may sufficient cover majority of
antigenic diversity polymorphic ama1 antigens. antigenic properties not
strongly related existing haplotype groupings based sequence analysis.
conclusions: antigenic diversity ama1 limited vaccine including a
small number alleles might sufficient coverage against
naturally-circulating strains, supporting multi-allele approach developing 
polymorphic antigens malaria vaccines.
