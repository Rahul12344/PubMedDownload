plasmodium parasites valuable models understand nucleotide composition
affects mutation, diversification, adaptation. observed eukaryotes
have undergone large changes genomic guanine-cytosine (gc) content as
seen genus plasmodium (∼30% within 35-40 myr). although mutational biases 
are known influence gc content human-infective plasmodium vivax and
plasmodium falciparum; study addressed different gene functional
classes contribute genus-wide compositional changes, plasmodium gc
content variation driven natural selection. here, tested hypothesis 
that certain gene processes functions drive variation global gc content
between plasmodium species. performed large-scale comparative genomic
analysis using genomes predicted genes 17 plasmodium species
encompassing wide genomic gc content range. genic gc content sorted and
divided ten equally sized quantiles assessed functional
enrichment classes. agreement selection gene classes may drive genomic
gc content, trans-membrane proteins enriched within extreme gc content
quantiles (q1 q10). specifically, variant surface antigens, primarily
interact vertebrate immune systems, showed skewed gc content distributions
compared trans-membrane proteins. although definitive causation
linking gc content, expression, positive selection within variant surface
antigens plasmodium vivax, plasmodium berghei, plasmodium falciparum
could established, found regardless genomic nucleotide
composition, genic gc content expression positively correlated during
trophozoite stages. overall, data suggest that, alongside mutational
biases, functional protein classes drive plasmodium gc content change.
