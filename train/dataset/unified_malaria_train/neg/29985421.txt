drug resistant plasmodium falciparum parasites represent major obstacle 
efforts control malaria, deadly vector borne infectious disease. this
situation creates urgent need find validate new drug targets contain
the spread disease. several genes associated unfolded protein
response (upr) including glucose-regulated protein 78â€‰kda (grp78, also known as
bip) deemed potential drug targets. explored drug target
potential grp78, molecular chaperone regulator upr, the
treatment p. falciparum parasite infection. screening repurposed chaperone 
inhibitors anticancer agents, showed grp78 inhibition lethal 
to drug-sensitive -resistant p. falciparum parasite strains vitro. we
correlated antiplasmodial activity inhibitors ability to
bind malaria chaperone, characterizing binding recombinant
parasite grp78. furthermore, determined crystal structure atp
binding domain p. falciparum grp78 adp identified structural features
unique parasite. data suggest p. falciparum grp78 a
valid drug target structural differences human grp78 emphasize
potential generate parasite specific compounds.
