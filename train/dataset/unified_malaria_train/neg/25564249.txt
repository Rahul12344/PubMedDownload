background: a581 g: mutation gene encoding plasmodium falciparum
dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), combination quintuple mutant
involving mutations dhps gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr), so-called sextuple mutant, associated increased
placental inflammation decreased infant birth weight among women receiving
intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (iptp-sp) during
pregnancy.
methods: 2009 2011, delivering women without human immunodeficiency
virus infection enrolled observational study iptp-sp effectiveness 
in malawi. parasites detected polymerase chain reaction (pcr); positive
samples sequenced genotype dhfr dhps loci. presence k540
e: dhps used marker quintuple mutant.
results: samples 1809 women analyzed pcr; 220 (12%) positive
for p. falciparum. total 202 specimens genotyped codon 581 dhps; 
17 (8.4%) harbored sextuple mutant. sextuple mutant associated with
higher risks patent infection peripheral blood (adjusted prevalence ratio
[apr], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.82-4.18) placental blood (apr
3.28; 95% ci, 1.88-5.78) higher parasite densities. recent sp use not
associated increased parasite densities placental pathology overall and
among women parasites carrying dhps a581 g: .
conclusions: iptp-sp failed inhibit parasite growth exacerbate
pathology among women infected sextuple-mutant parasites. new interventions 
to prevent malaria pregnancy needed urgently.
