with completion functional genome, merozoite proteome and
stage-specific transcriptomes intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of
plasmoidum falciparum, development new vaccine candidates targeting
plasmodium merozoites possible. report using protein array
technology detect antibody responses plasmodium merozoite proteins by
screening serum plasmodium-exposed individuals. total 138 genes
encoding p. falciparum merozoite proteins cloned using in-fusion cloning
method expressed using wheat germ cell-free system (wgcf). proteins
were screened serum plasmodium-exposed individuals unexposed
subjects using protein arrays. total 30 highly immunoreactive merozoite
antigens identified (21.7% 138 target proteins), including 10
well-characterized blood-stage vaccine candidates p. falciparum. addition,
we report first time 7 proteins (msp3.5, mrsp2, etramp11.2, etramp14.1
and ralp1, two hypothetical proteins pfa0210c pf14_0572) being
immunologically reactive. novel plasmodium merozoite antigens may be
potential vaccine candidates blood-stage malaria, warrant study.
