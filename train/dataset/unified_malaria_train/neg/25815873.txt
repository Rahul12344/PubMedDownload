background & objectives: aedes albopictus one vectors dengue and
chikungunya emergence pyrethroid resistance species could 
major concern controlling vector. study reports insecticide
susceptibility status ae. albopictus ddt pyrethroids indian
populations status presence knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations.
methods: three four day old adult female ae. albopictus collected delhi, 
gurgaon (haryana), hardwar (uttarakhand), guwahati (assam) kottayam (kerala) 
were bio-assayed ddt (4%), permethrin (0.75%) deltamethrin (0.05%)
impregnated papers using standard susceptibility test kit. mosquitoes were
pcrgenotyped f1534c kdr-mutation voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc)
gene. ddt pyrethroid resistant individuals sequenced partial domain 
ii, iii iv vgsc targeting residues s989, i1011, v1016, f1534 d1794
where kdr mutations reported ae. aegypti.
results: adult bioassays revealed varying degree resistance ddt among 
five populations ae. albopictus corrected mortalities ranging 61 
and 92%. kerala delhi populations showed incipient resistance against
permethrin deltamethrin respectively. populations susceptible 
for synthetic pyrethroids. none kdr mutations detected any
of ddt, deltamethrin permethrin resistant individuals.
interpretation & conclusion: ae. albopictus developed resistance ddt 
and emergence incipient resistance pyrethroids some
populations. far, evidence presence knockdown resistance
(kdr) mutation ae. albopictus.
