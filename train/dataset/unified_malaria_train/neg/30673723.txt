the development sterilizing vaccine malaria remains one the
highest priorities global health research. sporozoite vaccines
targeting pre-erythrocytic stage show great promise, possible
to maintain efficacy long-term, likely due inability vaccines to
maintain effector memory cell responses liver. vaccines based human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) might overcome limitation since vectors based on
rhesus cmv (rhcmv), homologous virus rhesus macaques (rm), elicit and
indefinitely maintain high frequency, non-exhausted effector memory cells in
extralymphoid tissues, including liver. moreover, rhcmv strain 68-1 elicits
cd8+ cells broadly recognizing unconventional epitopes exclusively restricted
by mhc-ii mhc-e. evaluate potential unique immune responses
to protect malaria, expressed four plasmodium knowlesi (pk) antigens
(csp, ama1, ssp2/trap, msp1c) rhcmv 68-1 rh189-deleted 68-1, which
additionally elicits canonical mhc-ia-restricted cd8+ cells. upon inoculation
of rm either pk ag expressing rhcmv vaccines, obtained cell
responses four pk antigens. upon challenge pk sporozoites 
observed delayed appearance blood stage parasites vaccinated rm
consistent 75-80% reduction parasite release liver. moreover, 
the rh189-deleted rhcmv/pk vectors elicited sterile protection one rm. in
the blood, parasite growth affected. contrast cell responses
induced pk infection, rhcmv vectors maintained sustained cell responses to
all four malaria antigens liver post-challenge. delayed appearance 
blood stage parasites thus likely due cell-mediated inhibition liver
stage parasite development. such, vaccine approach used to
efficiently test new cell antigens, improve current vaccines targeting the
liver stage complement vaccines targeting erythrocytic antigens.
