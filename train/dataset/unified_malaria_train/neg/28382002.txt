coarse-grained models dna made important contributions the
determination physical properties genomic dna, working molecular
machine gene regulation. study, analyze global dynamics of
long dna sequences consideration sequence-dependent geometry, propose 
elastic network models dna particle represents k nucleotides
(1-particle-per-k-nucleotides, 1pkn). models adjusted according to
profiles anisotropic fluctuations obtained previous
1-particle-per-1-nucleotide (1p1n) model, proven reproduce such
profiles all-atom models. confirmed 1p3n 1p4n models are
suitable analysis detailed dynamics local twisting motion. the
models intended analysis large structures, e.g., 10-nm fibers in
the nucleus, nucleoids mitochondrial phage dna low computational
costs. example, surveyed physical characteristics whole
mitochondrial human plasmodium falciparum genomes.
