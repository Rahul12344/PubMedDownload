anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, main vector malaria africa, is
characterized vast geographical range complex population structure.
assortative mating amongst reproductively isolated cryptic forms that
co-occur many areas poses unique challenges programs aiming decrease
malaria incidence via release sterile genetically-modified mosquitoes. 
importantly, whether laboratory-rearing affects ability an. gambiae
individuals given cryptic taxa successfully mate individuals of
their form field conditions still unknown yet crucial for
mosquito-releases. here, independent effects genetic environmental
factors associated laboratory rearing male female survival, mating
success assortative mating evaluated mopti form an. gambiae
over 2010 2011. semi-field enclosures experiments despite strong
variation years, overall survival mating success male and
female progeny laboratory strain found significantly lower
than progeny field females population. adult
progeny field-caught females reared larval stage laboratory
and laboratory females reared outdoors exhibited significant decrease in
survival mating success. importantly, laboratory individuals reared as
larvae indoors unable mate assortatively adults, whilst field progeny 
reared either outdoors laboratory, well laboratory progeny reared
outdoors mated significantly assortatively. results highlight the
importance genetic environment interactions development an.
gambiae's full mating behavioral repertoire challenges creates for
mosquito rearing release-based control strategies.
