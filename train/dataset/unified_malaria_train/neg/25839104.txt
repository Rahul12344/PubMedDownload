there urgent need improvements vaccine delivery technologies. this
is particularly pertinent vaccination programmes within regions limited
resources, required adequate provision disposal used
needles. microneedles micron-sized structures penetrate stratum
corneum skin, creating temporary conduits needle-free delivery 
drugs vaccines. here, aimed investigate immunity induced the
recombinant simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine chad63.me-trap; currently
undergoing clinical assessment candidate malaria vaccine, delivered
percutaneously silicon microneedle arrays. mice, demonstrate that
microneedle-mediated delivery chad63.me-trap induced similar numbers of
transgene-specific cd8(+) cells compared intradermal (id) administration
with needle-and-syringe, following single immunisation chad63/mva
heterologous prime-boost schedule. mice immunised chad63/mva were
challenged live plasmodium berghei sporozoites, microneedle-mediated
chad63.me-trap priming demonstrated equivalent protective efficacy id
immunisation. furthermore, responses following chad63/mva immunisation correlated
with specific design parameter array used ('total array volume'). the
level transgene expression immunisation site skin-draining lymph
node (dln) also linked total array volume. findings have
implications defining silicon microneedle array design use live,
vectored vaccines.
