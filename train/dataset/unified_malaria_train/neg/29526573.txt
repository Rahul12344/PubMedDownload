background: plasmodium vivax remains potential cause morbidity mortality
for people living endemic. understanding regional genetic
diversity p. vivax valuable studying population dynamics tracing
the origins parasites. plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite gene (pvcsp) is
highly polymorphic used previously marker p. vivax
population studies. aim study investigate genetic diversity
of pvcsp, provide genetic polymorphism data studies on
p. vivax population structure, tracking origin clinical cases.
methods: nested pcr dna sequencing pvcsp performed obtain
nucleotide sequences p. vivax isolates collected zhejiang province,
china, 2006 2014. investigate genetic diversity pvcsp, 
nucleotide sequences amino acid sequences pvcsp analyzed using
dnastar, mega software phylogenetic tree constructed. relatedness
between polymorphism infection source also analyzed using spss
software.
results: 66 p. vivax isolates collected zhejiang province either
indigenous cases cases imported different regions world. 66
p. vivax isolates belonged vk210 variant. fourteen different peptide
repeat motifs (prms) detected central repeat region (crr) pvcsp,
among which, two prms gdradgqpa gdraagqpa widely distributed all
isolates. several polymorphic characteristics vk210 variant observed,
including insertion sequence 12 peptides, frequency ggna
repeat, frequency prms repeat crr, frequency prm 
gngaggqaa repeat, indicative tracking parasite.
conclusion: study presents abundant genetic diversity pvcsp marker
among p. vivax strains around world. genetic data valuable expand 
the polymorphism information p. vivax, could helpful further
study population dynamics tracking origin p. vivax.
