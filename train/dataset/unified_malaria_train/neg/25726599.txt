objective: clone express dbl domain plasmodium falciparum merozoite
surface protein mspdbl2(dbl2), investigate antigenicity.
methods: dbl2 fragment amplified pcr cloned pet28a vector.
the recombinant pet28a-dbl2 plasmid transformed e. coli bl21 (de3) and
protein expression induced iptg. expressed product purified by
ni-nta affinity chromatography, analyzed sds-page western blotting.
results: dbl2 gene fragment plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein
mspdbl2 (950 bp) obtained pcr. recombinant pet28a-dbl2 plasmid was
identified pcr, double enzyme digestion, dna sequencing. recombinant
dbl2 protein expressed inclusion body form mr 340,000 
induced iptg. moreover, purified recombinant dbl2 protein recognized
by sera patients falciparum malaria.
conclusion: recombinant pet28a-dbl2 plasmid constructed. the
purified rdbl2 protein shows adequate antigenicity.
