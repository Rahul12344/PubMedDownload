there concern susceptibility staphylococcus aureus tetracyclines
may decrease due use antimalarial prophylaxis (doxycycline). examined
characteristics related tetracycline resistance, including doxycycline
exposure, s. aureus isolates collected via admission surveillance swabs and
inpatient clinical cultures united states military personnel injured 
deployment (june 2009-january 2012). tetracycline class resistance determined
using antimicrobial susceptibility testing. first s. aureus isolate 168 
patients analyzed, 38 (23%) isolates resistant to
tetracyclines (class). tetracycline-resistant isolates higher proportion of
resistance clindamycin (p=0.019) compared susceptible isolates. was
no significant difference tetracycline resistance isolates collected
from patients without antimalarial prophylaxis; however, significantly
more isolates tet(m) resistance genes doxycycline exposure group
(p=0.031). despite 55% patients receiving doxycycline antimalarial
prophylaxis, association resistance tetracyclines.
