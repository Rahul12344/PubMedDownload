the gene fragment pfc0460w amplified rna plasmodium falciparum 3d7
strain rt-pcr, cloned pgem-t easy vector. recombinant plasmid
was transformed e. coli dh5alpha positive clones selected,
which identified pcr sequencing. results showed were
three sequences pfc0460w fragment, respectively length 618, 597 and
543 bp. 618 bp fragment completely consistent sequence published
in plasmodb (genbank no. xm_001351147), 597 bp 543 bp fragments 
submitted genbank accession no. jf799872 jf799873, respectively.
205 amino acids encoded 618 bp fragment, five kinds protein
structure predicted robetta.
