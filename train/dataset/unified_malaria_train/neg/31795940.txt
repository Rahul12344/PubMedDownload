background: malaria pathogenesis relies sexual gametocyte forms malaria
parasite transmitted infected human mosquito host but
the molecular mechanisms controlling gametocytogenesis remains poorly understood.
here provide high-resolution transcriptome plasmodium falciparum it
commits develops gametocytogenesis.
results: gametocyte-associated transcriptome significantly different 
that asexual parasites, dynamic gene expression shifts characterizing
early, intermediate late-stage gametocyte development results in
differential timing sex-specific transcripts. transcriptional dynamics
suggest strict transcriptional control gametocytogenesis p. falciparum,
which propose mediated putative regulators including epigenetic
mechanisms (driving active repression proliferation-associated processes) 
a cascade-like expression apiap2 transcription factors.
conclusions: gametocyte transcriptome serves blueprint sexual
differentiation rich resource future functional studies this
critical stage plasmodium development, intraerythrocytic transcriptome 
has understanding asexual cycle.
