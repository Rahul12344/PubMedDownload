background: genome sequencing anopheles gambiae completed ten
years ago accelerated research malaria transmission. however,
annotation needs refined verified experimentally, predicted
transcripts identified comparative analysis genomes 
species. mosquito midgut-the first organ interact plasmodium
parasites-mounts effective antiplasmodial responses limit parasite survival 
and disease transmission. high-throughput illumina sequencing midgut
transcriptome used identify new genes transcripts, contributing the
refinement an. gambiae genome annotation.
results: sequenced ~223 million reads an. gambiae midgut cdna libraries
generated susceptible (g3) refractory (l35) mosquito strains. mosquitoes
were infected either plasmodium berghei plasmodium falciparum, and
midguts collected first second plasmodium infection. total, 
22,889 unique midgut transcript models generated an. gambiae
strain sequences combined, 76% potentially novel. novel
transcripts, 49.5% aligned annotated genes appear isoforms or
pre-mrnas reference transcripts, 50.5% mapped regions between
annotated genes represent novel intergenic transcripts (nits). predicted
models validated midgut expression using qrt-pcr microarray
analysis, novel isoforms confirmed sequencing predicted intron-exon
boundaries. coding potential analysis revealed 43% total midgut
transcripts appear long non-coding rna (lncrna), functional annotation 
of nits showed 68% homology current databases species. 
reads also analyzed using de novo assembly predicted transcripts
compared genome mapping-based models. finally, variant analysis g3 and
l35 midgut transcripts detected 160,742 variants respect an. gambiae 
pest genome, 74% new variants. intergenic transcripts higher
frequency variation compared non-intergenic transcripts.
conclusion: in-depth illumina sequencing assembly an. gambiae
midgut transcriptome doubled number known transcripts tripled the
number variants known mosquito species. also revealed existence 
a large number lncrna opens new possibilities investigating the
biological function many newly discovered transcripts.
