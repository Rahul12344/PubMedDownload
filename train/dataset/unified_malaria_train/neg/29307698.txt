plasmodium parasites develop within red blood cells parasitophorous vacuole 
enclosed membrane, pvm. protein family etramp (early transcribed
membrane protein) comprises small proteins inserted pvm via single
transmembrane domain. among those, pfs16 specifically found p. falciparum
gametocyte pvm. p. berghei gene pbanka_1003900 syntenic pfs16. the
encoded proteins similar domain structure overall protein
similarity low. transcript p. berghei gene found in
gametocytes ookinetes c-terminal mcherry fusion protein revealed
its presence gametocytes. knock-out mutant pbanka_1003900 gene
was affected sexual development ookinete formation similar wt. 
the mutation adverse effect transmission mosquito although 
there reduction number oocysts formed mutant parasites.
