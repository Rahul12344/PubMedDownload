malaria deadly disease causes nearly one million deaths year. to
develop methods control eradicate malaria, important understand
the genetic basis plasmodium falciparum adaptations antimalarial treatments
and human immune system taking account demographic history. to
study demographic history identify genes selection more
efficiently, sequenced complete genomes 25 culture-adapted p.
falciparum isolates three sites senegal. show no
significant population structure among senegal sampling sites. fitting
demographic models synonymous allele-frequency spectrum, also estimated
a major 60-fold population expansion parasite population âˆ¼20,000-40,000
years ago. using inferred demographic history null model coalescent
simulation, identified candidate genes selection, including genes
identified before, pfcrt pfama1, well new candidate genes.
interestingly, also found selection g/c a/t changes offsets
the large mutational bias toward a/t, two unusual patterns: similar
synonymous nonsynonymous allele-frequency spectra, 18% genes 
nonsynonymous-to-synonymous polymorphism ratio >1.
