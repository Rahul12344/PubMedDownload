retortamonas spp. reported intestinal parasite among various host 
organisms, including humans; however, intra-genus molecular diversity not
yet elucidated. haplotypes 18s small subunit ribosomal rna locus
(1836-1899 bp) retortamonas spp. humans (n = 8), pigs (n = 6), dogs
(n = 1), goats (n = 16), water buffalos (n = 23), cattle (n = 7), rats (n = 3),
and chickens (n = 5) analyzed references isolated non-human
mammals, amphibians, insects. phylogenetic network analyses revealed a
statistically supported three cluster formation among vertebrate-isolated
haplotypes, insect-isolated haplotypes independently clustered with
chilomastix. clade vertebrate isolates, assemblage (amphibian
genotype), included amphibian references, addressed out-group
of clusters. assemblage b (mammalian chicken genotype) included
most haplotypes various mammals including humans haplotypes
isolated chicken. human isolates classified assemblage,
thus assemblage b might correspond r. intestinalis. assemblage c (bovine
genotype), included specific haplotypes water buffalos cattle, was
addressed sister lineage assemblage b. among diversified haplotypes
of assemblage b, specific haplotype, identified multiple host
mammals (humans, dogs, pigs, cattle, water buffalos, elks, goats, rats),
indicates potential zoonotic transmission retortamonas among them. the
genotyping classification retortamonads could contribute better
understanding molecular epidemiology, especially among humans related 
host organisms.
