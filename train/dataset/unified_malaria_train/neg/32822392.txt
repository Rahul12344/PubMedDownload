artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) recommended world
health organization (who) first-line treatment uncomplicated plasmodium
falciparum (p. falciparum) malaria since 2005 democratic republic congo
(drc) regular surveillance act efficacy required ensure the
treatment effectiveness. mutations propeller domain pfk13 gene were
identified molecular markers artemisinin resistance (art-r). study
investigated pfk13-propeller gene polymorphism clinical isolates p.
falciparum collected drc. 2017, ten geographical sites across drc 
selected cross-sectional study conducted first kinshasa from
january march, nine sites september december. dried 
blood samples collected patients attending health centers fever
where diagnosis malaria first made rapid diagnostic test (rdt)
available site (sd bioline malaria ag pf carestart malaria pf) thick 
blood smear confirmed p. falciparum real-time pcr assay. a
pfk13-propeller segment containing fragment codes amino acids at
positions 427-595 amplified conventional pcr sequencing. total, 
1070 patients enrolled study. real-time pcr performed confirmed the
initial diagnosis p. falciparum infection 806 samples (75.3%; 95% ci:
72.6%- 77.9%). 717 successfully sequenced p. falciparum isolates, 710
(99.0%; 95% ci: 97.9% - 99.6) wild-type genotypes 7 (1.0%; 95% ci: 0.4% 
- 2.1%) carried non-synonymous (ns) mutations pfk13-propeller including 2
mutations (a578s v534a) previously detected 2 (m472i a569t) not
yet detected drc. mutations associated art-r southeast asia were
not observed drc. however, presence mutations pfk13-propeller 
gene calls investigations assess implication drug
resistance.
