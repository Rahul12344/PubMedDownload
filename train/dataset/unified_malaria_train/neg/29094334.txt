erythropoiesis marked progressive changes morphological, biochemical and
mechanical properties erythroid precursors generate red blood cells (rbc). 
the earliest enucleated forms derived process, known reticulocytes,
are multi-lobular spherical. reticulocytes mature, undergo series
of dynamic cytoskeletal re-arrangements expulsion residual organelles,
resulting highly deformable biconcave rbcs (normocytes). understand the
significant, yet neglected proteome-wide changes associated reticulocyte
maturation, undertook quantitative proteomics approach. immature
reticulocytes (marked presence surface transferrin receptor, cd71) 
mature rbcs (devoid cd71) isolated human cord blood using magnetic
separation procedure. sub-fractionation triton-extracted membrane
proteins luminal samples (isobaric tags relative absolute
quantitation), quantitative mass spectrometry conducted identify than
1800 proteins good confidence coverage. structural proteins
(such spectrins, ankyrin band 3) well surface glycoproteins were
conserved, proteins associated microtubule structures, talin-1/2 and
ß-tubulin, detected immature reticulocytes. atomic force microscopy 
(afm)-based imaging revealed extended network spectrin filaments in
reticulocytes (with average length 48 nm), shortened during
reticulocyte maturation (average spectrin length 41 nm normocytes). the
extended nature cytoskeletal network may partly account increased
deformability shape changes, reticulocytes transform normocytes.
