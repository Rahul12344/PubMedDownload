the bacterial reca protein eukaryotic homologue rad51 play central role
in homologous dna strand exchange reaction recombination dna
repair. previously, lab shown pfrad51, plasmodium falciparum
homologue rad51, exhibited atpase activity promoted dna strand exchange in
vitro. study, evaluated catalytic functions pfrad51 the
presence putative interacting partners, especially p. falciparum homologues of
rad54 replication protein a. pfrad54 accelerated pfrad51-mediated pairing
between single-stranded dna (ssdna) homologous linear double-stranded dna
(dsdna) presence 0.5 mm cacl2. also present evidence that
recombinant pfrpa1l protein serves function bacterial homologue
single-stranded binding protein (ssb) initiating homologous pairing strand
exchange activity. importantly, function pfrpa1l negatively
regulated dose-dependent manner pfrpa1s, another rpa homologue p.
falciparum. finally, present vivo evidence comet assays methyl 
methane sulfonate-induced dna damage malaria parasites accompanying
upregulation pfrad51, pfrad54, pfrpa1l, pfrpa1s level transcript
and protein needed repair dna damage. study provides new insights into
the role putative rad51-interacting proteins involved homologous
recombination emphasizes physiological role dna damage repair during
the growth parasites.importance: homologous recombination plays major role
in chromosomal rearrangement, rad51 protein, aided several proteins,
plays central role dna strand exchange reaction recombination dna
repair. study reports characterization role p. falciparum
rad51 homologous strand exchange dna repair evaluates functional
contribution pfrad54 pfrpa1 proteins. data presented provide
mechanistic insights dna recombination dna damage repair mechanisms in
this parasite. importance research findings future work be
to investigate rad51-dependent mechanisms involved chromosomal
rearrangements antigenic variation p. falciparum. prominent
determinant antigenic variation, extraordinary ability parasite 
rapidly change surface molecules, associated var genes, antigenic
variation presents major challenge vaccine development.
