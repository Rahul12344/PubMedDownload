background: knowledge rate action compounds cultured malaria
parasites required determine optimal time-points drug mode of
action studies, well predict likely vivo parasite clearance rates 
order select optimal hit compounds development. study,
changes parasite atp levels transgenic luciferase reporter activity were
explored means detect drug-induced stress cultured parasites.
methods: vitro cultures plasmodium falciparum 3d7 wild-type firefly
luciferase-expressing parasites incubated panel six anti-malarial 
compounds 10 hours parasite atp levels luciferase activity determined 
at two-hour intervals using luminescence-based reagents. comparative
purposes, parasite morphology changes evaluated light microscopy, well
as extent parasites recover 48 hours six-hour drug
treatment using parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay.
results: changes parasite atp levels displayed three phenotypes: mild no
change (chloroquine, dfmo); 2-4 fold increase (mefloquine, artemisinin); severe
depletion (ritonavir, gramicidin). respective phenotypes rate at
which manifested correlated closely extent parasites
recovered six-hour drug treatment (with exception chloroquine) 
the appearance severity morphological changes observed light
microscopy. luciferase activity decreased profoundly parasites treated with
mefloquine, artemisinin ritonavir (34-67% decrease 2 hours), while
chloroquine dfmo produced mild changes 10 hours. gramicidin yielded
intermediate decreases luciferase activity.
conclusions: atp levels luciferase activity respond rapidly incubation
with anti-malarial drugs provide quantitative read-outs detect the
appearance magnitude drug-induced stress cultured parasites. the
correlation observed changes irreversible parasite toxicity is
not yet sufficiently clear predict clinical clearance rates, may useful
for ranking compounds standard drugs vis-Ã -vis rate of
action determining early time-points drug mode action studies.
