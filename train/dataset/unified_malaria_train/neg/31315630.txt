background: recent years, scale-up long-lasting insecticidal nets
(llins) indoor residual spraying (irs) greatly reduced malaria
transmission. however, malaria remains global public health concern the
majority disease burden sub-saharan africa. insecticide resistance a
growing problem among anopheles vector populations, potential implications
for continued effectiveness available control interventions. improved
understanding current resistance levels underlying mechanisms essential
to design appropriate management strategies mitigate future selection 
resistance.
methods: anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected three
villages faranah prefecture, guinea levels susceptibility to
seven insecticides measured using cdc resistance intensity bioassays.
synergist assays piperonyl butoxide (pbo) also undertaken assess the
role elevated mixed-function oxidases resistance. five hundred and
sixty-three mosquitoes underwent molecular characterization vector species,
presence target site mutations (l1014f kdr, n1575y g119s ace-1),
plasmodium falciparum infection, relative expression three metabolic genes
(cyp6m2, cyp6p3 gstd3).
results: faranah, resistance permethrin deltamethrin observed, as
well possible resistance bendiocarb. assayed vector populations were
fully susceptible alpha-cypermethrin, pirimiphos-methyl, clothianidin and
chlorfenapyr. plasmodium falciparum infection detected 7.3% (37/508) of
mosquitoes tested. l1014f kdr mutation found 100% sub-sample of
60 mosquitoes, supporting fixation region. n1575y mutation was
identified 20% (113/561) individuals, ongoing selection evidenced by
significant deviations hardy-weinberg equilibrium. g119s ace-1 mutation 
was detected 62.1% (18/29) mosquitoes tested highly predictive of
bendiocarb bioassay survival. metabolic resistance genes, cyp6m2, cyp6p3 
gstd3, found overexpressed wild resistant susceptible an.
gambiae sensu stricto populations, compared susceptible g3 colony.
furthermore, cyp6p3 significantly overexpressed bendiocarb survivors,
implicating potential role carbamate resistance faranah.
conclusions: identification intense resistance permethrin deltamethrin 
in faranah, concern, guinea national malaria control programme
(nmcp) relies exclusively distribution pyrethroid-treated llins for
vector control. study findings used guide current future control
strategies region.
