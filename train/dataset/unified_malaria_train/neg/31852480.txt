background: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) cornerstone malaria
chemoprophylaxis considered programmes democratic republic of
congo (drc). however, sp efficacy threatened drug resistance, is
conferred mutations dhfr dhps genes. world health organization 
has specified intermittent preventive treatment infants (ipti) sp
should implemented prevalence dhps k540e mutation 
50%. limited current data prevalence resistance-conferring
mutations available eastern drc. current study aimed address this
knowledge gap.
methods: dried blood-spot samples collected clinically suspected
malaria patients [outpatient department (opd)] pregnant women attending
antenatal care (anc) four sites north south kivu, drc. quantitative pcr
(qpcr) performed samples individuals positive negative 
rapid diagnostic test (rdt) results. dhps k450e a581g dhfr i164l were
assessed nested pcr followed allele-specific primer extension detection
by multiplex bead-based assays.
results: across populations, plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence 47.9% 
(1160/2421) rdt 71.7 (1763/2421) qpcr. median parasite density measured
by qpcr rdt-negative qpcr-positive samples low median 2.3
parasites/µl (iqr 0.5-25.2). resistance genotyping successfully performed 
rdt-positive samples rdt-negative/qpcr-positive samples success rates of
86.2% (937/1086) 55.5% (361/651), respectively. presence dhps k540e
was high across sites (50.3-87.9%), strong evidence differences 
sites (p < 0.001). dhps a581g mutants less prevalent (12.7-47.2%). dhfr 
i164l mutation found one sample.
conclusions: prevalence sp resistance marker dhps k540e exceeds 50% in
all four study sites north south kivu, drc. k540e mutations regularly
co-occurred mutations dhps a581g dhfr i164l mutation.
the current results support implementation ipti sp study
