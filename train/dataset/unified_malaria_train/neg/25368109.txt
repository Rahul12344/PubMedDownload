as intensity malaria transmission declined, plasmodium falciparum
parasite populations displayed decreased clonal diversity resulting the
emergence many parasites common genetic signatures (cgs). have
monitored cgs parasite clusters 2006 2013 thiès, senegal, using
the molecular barcode. first, one largest observed clusters cgs
parasites, present 24% clinical isolates 2008, declined 3.4% of
clinical isolates 2009, disappeared. begin explore the
relationship immune responses population emergence and
decline specific parasite genotypes, determined whether antibodies 
cgs parasites correlate prevalence. measured (i) antibodies capable
of inhibiting parasite growth culture (ii) antibodies recognizing the
surfaces infected erythrocytes (rbcs). igg obtained volunteers 2009
showed increased reactivity surfaces cgs-parasitized erythrocytes 
igg 2008. since p. falciparum emp-1 (pfemp-1) major variant surface
antigen, used var ups quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) and
sequencing degenerate dbl1α domain primers characterize var genes
expressed cgs parasites short-term vitro culture. cgs parasites show 
upregulation upsa var genes 2-cysteine-containing pfemp-1 molecules and
express dominant var transcript. work indicates cgs
parasites cluster express similar var genes, would expected 
by chance population, year-to-year variation immune
recognition surface antigens cgs parasite-infected erythrocytes. study
lays groundwork detailed investigations mechanisms driving the
expansion contraction specific parasite clones population.
