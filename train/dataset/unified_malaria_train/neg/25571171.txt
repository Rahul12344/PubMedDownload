the effects cell asynchrony time-series data: analysis gene
expression level plasmodium falciparum.

zhao w, dauwels j, cao j.

to investigate intraerythrocytic cycle plasmodium falciparum, time-series 
gene expression data measured infected red blood cells. however, the
observed data blurred due cell asynchrony experiments. this
paper, effects cell asynchrony investigated conducting numerical
experiments. simulation results suggest cell asynchrony varying
effects different intrinsic expression patterns. specifically, intrinsic
patterns high expression around late life stage likely be
affected cell asynchrony. also investigated effects cell
asynchrony influenced experimental conditions. certain parameters 
identified strong effects cell asynchrony, parameters
should measured biological experiments order deblur time-series
gene expression data.
