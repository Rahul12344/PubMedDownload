background: merozoites plasmodium falciparum invade several pathways
using different rbc receptors. field isolates appear use greater variability
of receptors laboratory isolates. brazilian field isolates shown 
to mostly utilize glycophorin a-independent invasion pathways via glycophorin b
(gpb) and/or receptors. brazilian population exhibits extensive
polymorphism blood group antigens, however, studies done to
relate prevalence antigens function receptors p.
falciparum ability parasite invade. study aimed to
establish whether variation gypb*s/s alleles influences susceptibility 
infection p. falciparum admixed population brazil.
methods: two groups brazilian amazonians porto velho studied: p.
falciparum infected individuals (cases); uninfected individuals born
and/or lived endemic region ten years, exposed 
infection malaria study period (controls). gpb ss
phenotype gypb*s/s alleles determined standard methods. sixty two
ancestry informative markers genotyped individual estimate
admixture control potential effect association frequency
of gypb*s malaria infection.
results: gypb*s associated host susceptibility infection p.
falciparum; gypb*s/gypb*s gypb*s/gypb*s significantly prevalent 
the p. falciparum infected individuals controls (69.87% vs.
49.75%; p<0.02). moreover, population genetics tests applied gypb exon
sequencing data suggest natural selection shaped observed pattern of
nucleotide diversity.
conclusion: epidemiological evolutionary approaches suggest important role
for gpb receptor rbc invasion p. falciparum brazilian amazons.
moreover, increased susceptibility infection parasite associated
with gpb s+ variant population.
