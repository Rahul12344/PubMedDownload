background: pyrethroid resistance well documented anopheles
arabiensis, one major african malaria vectors, predominant malaria
vector south africa.
methods: study, genetic basis pyrethroid resistance selected 
laboratory strain an. arabiensis south africa investigated using a
custom-made microarray, known an. gambiae detoxification chip.
results: large number p450 genes over-transcribed, well suite
of redox genes glutathione s-transferases. five genes showed the
highest level gene transcription compared insecticide susceptible
strain were: cyp6ag2, cypz1, tpx2, cypz2 cyp6p1.
conclusions: permethrin resistance south african an. arabiensis associated 
with increased transcription multiple genes, large proportion these
genes also previously recorded over-transcribed another an. arabiensis
strain selected resistance ddt cross-resistance deltamethrin. 
deltamethrin resistance developed de novo ddt-selected strain 
likely due increased transcription genes associated ddt
resistance. however, particular interest fact strain selected
for resistance pyrethroids develop de novo resistance ddt. these
differences compared discussed.
