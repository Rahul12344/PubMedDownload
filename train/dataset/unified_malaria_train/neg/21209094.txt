heat shock protein 90 participates diverse biological processes ranging from
protein folding, cell cycle, signal transduction development evolution 
all eukaryotes. also critically involved regulating growth protozoa
such dictyostelium discoideum, leishmania donovani, plasmodium falciparum,
trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosoma evansi. selective inhibition hsp90 also
been explored intervention strategy important human diseases such
as cancer, malaria, trypanosomiasis. giardia lamblia, simple protozoan
parasite humans animals, important cause diarrheal disease with
significant morbidity mortality tropical countries. show that
the g. lamblia cytosolic hsp90 (glhsp90) split two similar sized fragments 
located 777 kb apart scaffold. intrigued unique arrangement, 
which appears specific giardiinae, investigated the
biosynthesis glhsp90. used genome sequencing confirm split nature of
the giardial hsp90. however, specific antibody raised peptide
detected product mass 80 kda, suggesting post-transcriptional
rescue genomic defect. show evidence joining two
independent hsp90 transcripts in-trans one long mature mrna presumably rna 
splicing. splicing junction carries hallmarks classical cis-spliced
introns, suggesting regular cis-splicing machinery may sufficient for
repair open reading frame. complementary 26-nt sequence "intron" 
regions adjacent splice sites may assist positioning two pre-mrnas 
for processing. first example post-transcriptional rescue a
split gene trans-splicing.
