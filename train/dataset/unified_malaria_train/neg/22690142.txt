recent genomic studies demonstrated fungi possess gene clusters
encoding production previously unobserved secondary metabolites.
activation attenuated silenced genes obtain either improved titers
of known compounds new ones altogether subject considerable
interest. efforts discover new chemotypes effective against
infectious diseases, including malaria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
aureus (mrsa), isolated strain marine fungus, leucostoma persoonii, 
that produces bioactive cytosporones. epigenetic modifiers employed activate
secondary metabolite genes resulted enhanced production known cytosporones 
b (1, 360%), c (2, 580%) e (3, 890%), well production the
previously undescribed cytosporone r (4). cytosporone e bioactive,
displaying ic(90) 13 µm toward plasmodium falciparum, a549
cytotoxicity ic(90) 437 µm, representing 90% inhibition therapeutic index
(ti(90) = ic(90) a459/ic(90)p. falciparum) 33. addition, cytosporone e 
active mrsa minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 72 µm and
inhibition mrsa biofilm roughly half value (minimum biofilm
eradication counts, mbec90, found 39 µm).
