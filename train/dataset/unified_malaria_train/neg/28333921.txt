novel antimalarial therapies urgently needed fight against
drug-resistant parasites. metabolism malaria parasites infected cells
is attractive source drug targets rather complex. computational
methods handle complexity allow integrative analyses cell
metabolism. study, present genome-scale metabolic model (ipfa) of
the deadliest malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, its
thermodynamics-based flux analysis (tfa). using previous absolute concentration
data intraerythrocytic parasite, applied tfa ipfa predicted up
to 63 essential genes 26 essential pairs genes. 63 genes, 35 have
been experimentally validated reported literature, 28 not
been experimentally tested include previously hypothesized novel
predictions essential metabolic capabilities. without metabolomics data, four 
of genes would incorrectly predicted non-essential. tfa also 
indicated substrate channeling exist two metabolic pathways to
ensure thermodynamic feasibility flux. finally, analysis the
metabolic capabilities p. falciparum led identification the
minimal nutritional requirements genes become indispensable upon
substrate inaccessibility. model provides novel insight metabolic
needs capabilities malaria parasite highlights metabolites and
pathways measured characterized identify potential
thermodynamic bottlenecks substrate channeling. hypotheses presented seek
to guide experimental studies facilitate better understanding the
parasite metabolism identification targets efficient
intervention.
