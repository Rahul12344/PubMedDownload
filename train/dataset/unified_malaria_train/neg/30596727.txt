we recently identified three novel thioredoxin-like genes genome the
protozoan parasite plasmodium belong phosducin-like family of
proteins (phlp). phlps small cytosolic proteins hypothesized function in
g-protein signaling protein folding. although phlps highly conserved in
eukaryotes yeast mammals, representatives been
experimentally characterized date. addition, phlps contain a
thioredoxin domain, lack cxxc motif, strong indicator redox
activity, unclear whether members phlp family enzymatically 
active. here, describe pbphlp-3 first phosducin-like protein a
protozoan organism, plasmodium berghei. initial transcription analysis revealed
continuous low-level expression pbphlp-3 throughout complex plasmodium
life cycle. attempts knockout pbphlp-3 p. berghei yield live
parasites, suggesting essential role gene plasmodium. cloned,
expressed purified pbphlp-3 determined recombinant protein is
redox active vitro thioredoxin-coupled redox assay. also the
capacity reduce organic compound tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tbhp) vitro,
albeit low efficiency. sequence analysis, structural modeling, and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed conserved cysteine thioredoxin domain
to redox active residue. lastly, provide evidence recombinant
human phlp-3 exhibits redox activity similar pbphlp-3 suggest that
redox activity may conserved phlp-3 homologs species. data
provide new insight function phlp-3, hypothesized act 
co-chaperones folding regulation cytoskeletal proteins. discuss 
the potential implications phlp-3 thioredoxin-target protein possible
links cellular redox network eukaryotic protein folding
machinery.
