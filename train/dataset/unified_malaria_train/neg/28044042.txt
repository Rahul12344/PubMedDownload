piperaquine combined dihydroartemisinin one artemisinin derivative
combination therapies, replace artesunate-mefloquine treating
uncomplicated falciparum malaria thailand. aim study to
determine vitro sensitivity thai plasmodium falciparum isolates against
piperaquine influence pfmdr1 gene vitro response. one
hundred thirty-seven standard laboratory adapted thai isolates p.
falciparum assessed vitro piperaquine sensitivity. polymorphisms of
the pfmdr1 gene determined polymerase chain reaction methods. mean
and standard deviation piperaquine ic50 thai isolates p. falciparum 
were 16.7 ± 6.3 nm. parasites exhibiting chloroquine ic50 ≥ 100 nm were
significantly less sensitive piperaquine compared parasite with
chloroquine ic50 < 100 nm. significant association pfmdr1 copy 
number piperaquine ic50 values found. contrast, parasites
containing pfmdr1 86y allele exhibited significantly reduced piperaquine
sensitivity. nationwide implementation dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
as first-line treatment thailand, vitro vivo evaluations this
combination performed especially areas parasites containing
the pfmdr1 86y allele predominant thai-malaysian border.
