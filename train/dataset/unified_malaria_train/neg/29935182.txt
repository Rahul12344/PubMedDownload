schistosomes parasitic platyhelminths threaten 600 million people
globally. recent years, rna interference (rnai) widely used a
molecular tool research genomic function parasites. aim to
develop effective protocols application rnai technology the
intra-mammalian life stages schistosoma japonicum. work, the
expression parasite gene encoding cathepsin b1 (sjcb1) targeted by
exposing worms 10 μg long dsrna dissolved 0.1 ml 0.7% nacl
injected tail vein infected mice. method effective and
specific eliciting sjcb1 gene suppression male female adult worms
in vivo (>79.4% male >91.5% female knockdown relative control). in
60 cercaria infected mice, rnai suppression gene expression best achieved 
by using 10 μg target dsrna least 4 days. recommended procedure for
interference producing long-term suppression injection dsrna the
first day infection booster injections administered every 4 days up
to 26 days. long-term suppression three published functional genes
(peroxiredoxin-1, mago nashi, insulin receptor) s. japonicum provided more
information role expression genes producing
particular phenotypes. protocols described may convenient,
economical applicable, currently available technology have
contributed observation phenotypes worm development from
schistosomula adult. approaches may promote facilitate further
studies functional schistosome genomics.
