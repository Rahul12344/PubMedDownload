background: studies southeast asia reported strong relationship between
polymorphisms propeller domain kelch 13 (k13) protein encoded by
the plasmodium falciparum k13 (pfk13) gene delayed parasite clearance after
artemisinin treatment. africa, p. falciparum remains susceptible and
combination therapy regimens include artemisinin component display good 
efficacy. using quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), sub-microscopic persistence of
p. falciparum previously reported one-third children treated 
artemisinin combination therapy (act) western kenya. study, further
investigation made evaluate whether sub-microscopic residual
parasites also harbour mutations propeller region pfk13 whether the
mutations, any, affect treatment outcome.
methods: pfk13 propeller domain genotyped dna samples obtained 2009
from kenyan children treated artemether-lumefantrine (al) and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp). paired samples pre-treatment (day 0) 
day treatment failure (day 28 42) 32 patients documented recurrent
parasitaemia available genotyping. additional day 3 dna samples were
available 10 patients.
results: mutation associated artemisinin resistance southeast asia was
observed. one dp-treated patient harboured non-synonymous mutation at
codon 578 (a578s) pfk13-propeller gene day 0 sample, allele
was replaced wild-type (a578) form day 3 day recurrent
parasitaemia. mutation amino acid codon 578 showed association any
phenotype. polymorphisms pfk13 responsible parasite persistence
and gametocyte carriage children treated act.
conclusion: study contributes ongoing surveillance suspected
artemisinin resistance parasites africa providing baseline prevalence of
k13-propeller mutations western kenya samples collected a
longitudinal study. clinical trials registration nct00868465.
