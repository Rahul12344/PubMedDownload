background: despite recommendation world health organization all
malaria suspected patients undergo parasitological confirmation using rapid
diagnostic test light microscopy prior treatment, health facilities in
remote malaria endemic settings sometimes resort presumptive diagnosis of
malaria clinical management various reasons. following observation of
this practice, undertook cross-sectional study aimed comparing
presumptive diagnosis based axillary temperature, sd bioline™ rapid test, 
light microscopy strategies malaria diagnosis coastal region of
mutengene south west cameroon overall goal supporting
improved malaria diagnosis local levels.
methodology: venous blood 320 participants used detect presence
of malaria parasite using sd bioline™ mrdt giemsa stained microscopy or
spotted filter paper pcr amplification 18s rrna gene plasmodium 
sp following standard procedures. axillary temperature participant
was also measured. sensitivity, specificity, predictive values 
confidence intervals determined methods pcr the
reference. area curve used estimate accuracy diagnostic
method compared test method using x2 test p<0.05 considered 
significant.
results: overall diagnostic sensitivities presumptive diagnosis using
axillary temperature, light microscopy, sd bioline™ observed be
74.30% (95%ci: 67.90-80.01), 94.86% (95%ci: 90.99-97.41), 95.33% (95%ci:
91.57-97.74), respectively, respective diagnostic specificities were
53.77% (95%ci: 43.82-63.51), 94.34% (95%ci: 88.09-97.87), 94.34%(95%ci:
88.09-97.89). sd bioline™ diagnostic sensitivity 91.80% [95%ci:
81.90-97.28] parasitaemia less 500 parasites/μl blood a
sensitivity 100% parasite counts 500 parasites/μl blood. the
predictive values positive test highly comparable light
microscopy (90.09%, [95%ci: 83.61-94.18]) sd bioline™ mrdt (90.91%, [95%ci:
84.50-94.83]), p=0.98 kappa values 0.898 lower presumptive
diagnosis (50.89%, [95%ci: 43.72-58.03]), p<0.0001, kappa value 0.277.
perfect agreement observed sd bioline™ mrdt light microscopy
(cohen kappa= 0.924).
conclusions: study showed sd bioline™ good light microscopy in
the diagnosis malaria remote areas perennial transmission south west 
cameroon. study equally revealed limitations presumptive diagnosis of
malaria (as opposed use rdts microscopy). efforts made 
such areas promote parasitological confirmation malaria using quality
assured rapid tests light microscopy case management malaria. the
presence nonnegligible levels plasmodium ovale study area indicate 
that treatment guidelines may require revision trend proven several
other areas ecology.
