cerebral malaria (cm) severe form malaria caused plasmodium falciparum
and p.vivax. cm affects brain leading coma leading cause of
death malaria patients. enzyme, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (ampk), important metabolic sensor helps maintaining
energy homeostasis normal physiological well pathological
conditions. present study, studied status ampk mouse
model cm. c57bl/6 mice infected rodent-specific p.berghei anka were
used study. found statistically significant reduction gene
expressions prkaa1 (α1 subunit) prkaa2 (α2 subunit) brains cm
mice compared uninfected control. also, statistically significant 
reduction ratio phospho-ampk/ampk protein levels cm compared to
uninfected control. statistically significant decrease in
phospho-acc/acc ratio brain compared control. ampk downregulated 
in cm, possible involvement neuronal cell death cm
pathogenesis, therefore feel novel ampk activating drugs might be
helpful adjunctive therapy conferring neuroprotection.
