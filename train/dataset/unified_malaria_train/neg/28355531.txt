chloroquine, long default first-line treatment malaria, now
abandoned large parts world widespread drug-resistance in
plasmodium falciparum. spite importance cost-effective and
efficient drug, coherent understanding cellular mechanisms affected by
chloroquine influence fitness survival parasite
remains elusive. here, used systems biology approach integrate
genome-scale transcriptomics map effects chloroquine, identify
targeted metabolic pathways, translate findings mechanistic
insights. specifically, first developed method integrates
transcriptomic metabolomic data, independently validated a
recently published set data krebs-cycle mutants p. falciparum. 
then used method calculate effect chloroquine treatment the
metabolic flux profiles p. falciparum intraerythrocytic
developmental cycle. model predicted dose-dependent inhibition dna
replication, agreement earlier experimental results both
drug-sensitive drug-resistant p. falciparum strains. simulations also
corroborated experimental findings suggest differences chloroquine
sensitivity ring- schizont-stage p. falciparum. analysis also
suggests metabolic fluxes govern reduced thioredoxin and
phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis significantly decreased pivotal to
chloroquine-based inhibition p. falciparum dna replication. consequences
of impaired phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis redox metabolism reduced carbon
fixation increased oxidative stress, respectively, eventually
facilitate killing parasite. analysis suggests combination of
chloroquine (or analogue) another drug, inhibits carbon fixation
and/or increases oxidative stress, increase clearance p. falciparum
from host system.
