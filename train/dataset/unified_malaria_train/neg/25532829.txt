heterologous protein production key technology biotechnological, health 
sciences many research fields. various approaches developed
for optimization, research emphasis optimization of
protein yield rather protein quality. study, established a
workflow synthetic gene optimization heterologous protein expression that
combines bioinformatics, laboratory experiments, mass spectrometry and
statistical analysis. two gene primary structure analysis platforms, anaconda and
eugene, multivariate optimization methods employed re-design the
plasmodium falciparum lysyl-trna synthetase gene optimal expression in
escherichia coli. synthetic genes expressed common vectors, amino
acid mis-incorporations expressed proteins detected quantified
using mass spectrometry. association identified amino acid
mis-incorporations 23 gene variables analysed. synthetic genes
yielded significantly higher levels protein relative wild-type gene,
but 71 amino acid mis-incorporation sites observed along whole protein
and across synthetic genes statistically associated specific
codons protein secondary structures. optimization method led to
production accurate protein based multivariate approach that
combined variables known influence mrna translation.
