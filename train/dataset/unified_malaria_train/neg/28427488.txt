objective: study aimed investigate expression pattern function of
nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group e member 1 (nr2e1) retinoic acid
(ra)-induced brain abnormality.
methods: mouse model brain abnormality established administering 28
mg/kg ra, neural stem cells (nscs) isolated mouse embryo and
cultured vitro. nr2e1 expression detected whole mount situ
hybridization, rt-pcr, western blotting. nr2e1 function determined by
transducing nr2e1 shrna nscs, effect sonic hedgehog (shh)
signaling pathway assessed cells. addition, regulation nr2e1
expression ra also determined vitro.
results: nr2e1 expression significantly downregulated brain nscs
of ra-treated mouse embryos, knockdown nr2e1 affected proliferation of
nscs vitro. addition, similar expression pattern nr2e1 ra receptor
(rar) α observed treatment nscs different concentrations ra.
conclusion: study demonstrated nr2e1 could regulated ra, which
would aid better understanding mechanism underlying ra-induced brain
abnormality.
