we used sensitization approach involves replacement gatekeeper
residue protein kinase one different side chain. activity of
the enzyme bulky gatekeeper residue, methionine, cannot be
inhibited using bumped kinase inhibitors (bkis). here, used approach
to study plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (pfcdpk1). 
methionine gatekeeper substitution, t145m, although led 47% reduction 
transphosphorylation, successfully introduced cdpk1 locus using
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)/cas9. as
methionine bulky residue, bki 1294 10-fold-greater effect vitro 
the wild-type enzyme methionine mutant. however, contrast in
vitro data recombinant enzymes, bki 1294 slightly greater inhibition
of growth cdpk1 t145m parasites wild type. moreover, cdpk1
t145m parasites sensitive action compound 2 (c2), specific 
inhibitor protein kinase g (pkg). results suggest reduction in
the activity cdpk1 due methionine substitution gatekeeper position
is compensated direct action pkg another kinase the
regulation pkg. transcript levels cdpk5 cdpk6 significantly
upregulated cdpk1 t145m parasites. increase cdpk6 other
kinase may compensate decrease cdpk1 activity invasion. study 
suggests targeting two kinases may effective chemotherapy to
treat malaria select mutations one enzymes.importance:
protein kinases plasmodium falciparum actively pursued drug
targets treat malaria. however, compensatory mechanisms may reverse drug
activity kinase. study, show replacement the
wild-type threonine gatekeeper residue methionine reduces the
transphosphorylation activity cdpk1. mutant parasites methionine
gatekeeper residue compensate reduced activity cdpk1 action of
pkg possibly upregulation cdpk6 kinase. study highlights
that targeting one enzyme may lead changes transcript expression other
kinases compensate function may select mutants less
dependent target enzyme activity. thus, inhibiting two kinases better
strategy protect antimalarial activity each, similar artemisinin
combination therapy malarone (atovaquone proguanil).
