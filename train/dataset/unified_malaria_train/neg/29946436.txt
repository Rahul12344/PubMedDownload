background:  malaria continues present global health threat; world
health organization (who) reported 214 million cases malaria year 2015 
with death rate 438000. sudan endemic malaria 95% malaria
cases due plasmodium falciparum. chloroquine well-established drug the
treatment p. falciparum malaria although use declined since its
introduction drug choice treatment malaria sudan. the
mechanism resistance attributed mutations p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter gene coding key food vacuole proteins.
in current study aimed verifying genetic cause resistance to
chloroquine field isolates p. falciparum. methods: twenty p. falciparum
cases diagnosed east nile hospital khartoum recruited the
investigation. nested pcr conducted isolate mutation region in pfcrt
gene amplicons sequenced using sanger sequencing technique
(macrogen, soule korea). results: 16/20 (80%) field isolates contained
base pair mutation codon 76 pfcrt gene thus resistant to
chloroquine treatment 4/20 (20%) contain mutation.
conclusions: high treatment failures associated chloroquine treatment is
evident high prevalence mutant strains p. falciparum field isolates 
thus suggesting reduced relevance chloroquine treatment choice the
management p. falciparum malaria.
