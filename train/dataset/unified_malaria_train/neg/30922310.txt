background: persistence malaria large parts sub-saharan africa has
motivated development novel tools complement existing control
programmes, including gene-drive technologies modify mosquito vector
populations. here, use stochastic simulation model explore potential 
of using driving-y chromosome suppress vector populations 106 km2 area 
of west africa including burkina faso.
results: consequence driving-y introductions predicted vary across
the landscape, causing elimination target species regions and
suppression others. explore variation determined by
environmental conditions, mosquito behaviour, properties the
gene-drive. seasonality particularly important, find population
elimination likely regions mild dry seasons whereas suppression
is likely regions strong seasonality.
conclusions: despite spatial heterogeneity, suggest repeated
introductions modified mosquitoes years small fraction of
human settlements may sufficient substantially reduce overall number of
mosquitoes across entire geographic area.
