treatment symptomatic asexual stage plasmodium falciparum relies almost
exclusively artemisinin (art) combination therapies (acts) endemic regions.
acts combine art derivative long-acting partner drug maximize
efficacy typical three-day regimen. laboratory clinical
studies previously demonstrated common drug resistance determinants
p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) multidrug resistance
transporter (pfmdr1) modulate susceptibility many current antimalarial
drugs chemical compounds. investigated parasite responses to
dihydroartemisinin (dha) various ca(2+) na(+) channel blockers showed
positively correlated responses dha several channel blockers,
suggesting potential shared transport pathways mode action. additionally,
we demonstrated pfcrt pfmdr1 could also significantly modulate the
pharmacodynamic interactions compounds interactions were
influenced parasite genetic backgrounds. results provide important
information better understanding drug resistance assessing the
overall impact drug resistance markers parasite response acts.
