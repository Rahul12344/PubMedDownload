traditional methods localizing quantifying presence pathogenic
microorganisms living experimental animal models infections mostly
relied sacrificing animals, dissociating tissue counting the
number colony forming units. however, discovery several varieties of
the light producing enzyme, luciferase, genetic engineering bacteria, 
fungi, parasites mice make emit light, either administration of
the luciferase substrate, case bacterial lux operon without 
exogenous substrate, provided new alternative. dedicated bioluminescence
imaging (bli) cameras record light emitted living animals real
time allowing non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring anatomical location
and growth infectious microorganisms measured strength bli
signal. bli technology used follow bacterial infections traumatic 
skin wounds burns, osteomyelitis, infections intestines, mycobacterial
infections, otitis media, lung infections, biofilm endodontic infections 
meningitis. fungi engineered bioluminescent used
to study infections caused yeasts (candida) filamentous fungi.
parasitic infections caused malaria, leishmania, trypanosomes toxoplasma
have monitored bli. viruses vaccinia, herpes simplex,
hepatitis b c influenza, studied using bli. rapidly
growing technology expected continue provide much useful information,
while drastically reducing numbers animals needed experimental studies.
