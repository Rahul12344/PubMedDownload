despite controversy regarding importance protein n-linked
glycosylation species genus plasmodium, genes potentially encoding core
subunits oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) complex already been
characterized completely sequenced genomes malaria parasites. nevertheless,
the currently established notion four eight subunits the
ost complex-which considered conserved across eukaryotes-are present in
plasmodium species. study, carefully conduct computational analysis to
provide unequivocal evidence components ost complex, the
exception swp1/ribophorin ii, reliably identified within completely
sequenced plasmodial genomes. fact, subunits currently considered 
as absent plasmodium refer uncharacterized protein sequences already
existing sequence databases. interestingly, main reason unusually 
short ost4 subunit (36 residues long yeast) identified far 
plasmodia (and possibly species) failure gene-prediction
pipelines detect short coding sequence. identify elusive ost
subunits select protist species completely sequenced genomes. thus, our
work highlights necessity systematic approach towards the
characterization ost subunits across eukaryotes. necessary for
obtaining concrete picture evolution ost complex also for
elucidating possible role eukaryotic pathogens.
