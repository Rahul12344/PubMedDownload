background: current malaria control elimination strategies rely mainly on
efficacious antimalarial drugs. however, drug resistance major threat facing
malaria control programs. determination drug resistance molecular markers is
useful monitoring surveillance malaria drug efficacy. study
aimed determine mutations haplotypes frequencies different genes
linked antimalarial drug resistance certain areas sudan.
methods: total 226 dried blood spots (dbs) microscopically diagnosed p.
falciparum isolates collected khartoum three areas sudan
during 2015-2017. plasmodium falciparum confirmation multiplicity of
infection assessed using sanger's 101 snps-barcode speciation was
confirmed using regions parasite mitochondria. molecular genotyping of
drug resistance genes (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, exonuclease, pfk13,
parasite genetic background (pgb) (pfarps10, ferredoxin, pfcrt, pfmdr2)) also
performed. genotypes generated selective regions amplicon sequencing 
of parasite genome using illumina miseq platform wellcome sanger
institute, uk genotypes translated drug resistance haplotypes 
species determination.
findings: total 225 samples confirmed p. falciparum. higher
proportion multiplicity infection observed gezira (p<0.001) based on
the sanger 101 snps -barcode. overall frequency mutant haplotype pfcrt
72-76 cviet 71.8%. pfmdr1, n86y detected 53.6%, y184f observed
in 88.1% d1246y detected 1.5% samples. frequently
observed haplotype yfd 47.4%. pfdhfr (codons 51, 59,108,164), icni
haplotype frequent (80.7%) pfdhps (codons 436, 437, 540,
581, 613) (sgeaa) frequent haplotype (41%). quadruple mutation
(dhfr n51i, s108n + dhps a437g, k540e) highest frequent combined mutation
(33.9%). pfkelch13 gene, 18 non-synonymous mutations detected, 7 
were detected african countries. frequent pfk13 mutation was
e433d detected four samples. pfk13 mutant alleles been
reported belong mutations associated delayed parasite clearance in
southeast asia. pgb mutations detected pfcrt n326s\i (46.3%) and
pfcrt i356t (8.2%). exonuclease mutation detected. no
significant variation mutant haplotypes study areas.
conclusions: high frequency mutations pfcrt, pfdhfr pfdhps in
this study. mutations associated chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance. many snps pfk13 linked with
delayed parasite clearance observed. exonuclease e415g mutation is
linked piperaquine resistance reported.
