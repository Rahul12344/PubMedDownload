the relapsing peculiarity plasmodium vivax one prime reasons for
sustained global malaria transmission. global containment p. vivax more
challenging crucial compared species achieving total malaria
control/elimination. primaquine (pq) failure p. vivax relapse major
global public health concern. identification characterization different
relapse strains p. vivax prevalent across globe one the
thrust areas malaria research. despite renewed rising global concern by
researchers 'neglected' species, research development the
very topic p. vivax reappearance remains inadequate. many malaria endemic
countries mandated routine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
testing initiating pq radical cure p. vivax malaria. results in
either pq prescription thoughtless prescription administration pq to
p. vivax patients healthcare providers without concerned patients'
g6pd status associated complications. imperative ascertain g6pd 
status optimum dissemination pq radical cure cases p. vivax
malaria across globe. persists compelling need develop/validate 
rapid, easy-to-perform, easy-to-interpret, quality controllable, robust, and
cost-effective g6pd assay. high-dose pq standard short duration
appears safe effective preventing relapses be
practiced among patients normal g6pd activity. multicentric studies
involving adequately representative populations across globe reference
pq dose must carried determine true distribution pq failure.
study proving role cytochrome p450-2d6 gene pq metabolism association
of cyp2d6 metabolizer phenotypes p. vivax relapse prime importance 
should carried forward multicentric systems across globe.
