resurgence major concern malaria elimination. initiation 
the elimination program aneityum island 1991, microscopy showed that
plasmodium falciparum disappeared immediately, whereas p. vivax disappeared 
1996 onward, p. vivax cases reported january 2002. conducting
malariometric surveys entire population aneityum, investigated the
age distribution individuals parasites epidemic the
context antimalarial antibody levels parasite antigen diversity. july
2002, p. vivax infections detected microscopy 22/759 individuals:
20/298 born beginning elimination program 1991, 2/126 born
between 1982 1991, none 335 born 1982. pcr increased number
of infections detected 77, distributed among age groups. prevalences 
12.1%, 16.7%, 6.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). november, similar age
pattern found, fewer infections: 6/746 39/741 individuals were
found infected microscopy pcr, respectively. frequencies of
antibody responses p. vivax significantly higher individuals born
before 1991 younger age groups similar malakula
island, area endemicity. remarkably low antigen diversity (h, 0.15) p.
vivax infections observed aneityum compared islands (h,
0.89 1.0). p. vivax resurgence observed among children teenagers 
aneityum, age distribution similar elimination islands 
where p. vivax endemic, suggesting absence significant
exposure, immunity may persist, limiting infection levels adults. limited 
parasite gene pool islands may contribute protection.
