during last decade, vast omics field revolutionized biological
research, especially genomics, transcriptomics proteomics branches, as
technological tools become available field researcher allow difficult 
question-driven studies addressed. parasitology greatly benefited 
next generation sequencing (ngs) projects, resulted broadened
comprehension basic parasite molecular biology, ecology epidemiology.
malariology one example application technology greatly
contributed better understanding plasmodium spp. biology and
host-parasite interactions. among several parasite species cause human
malaria, neglected plasmodium vivax presents great research challenges, in
vitro culturing yet feasible functional assays heavily limited.
therefore, gaps p. vivax biology knowledge affect decisions
for control policies aiming eradicate vivax malaria near future. in
this review, provide snapshot key discoveries already achieved p.
vivax sequencing projects, focusing developments, hurdles, limitations
currently faced research community, well perspectives future
vivax malaria research.
