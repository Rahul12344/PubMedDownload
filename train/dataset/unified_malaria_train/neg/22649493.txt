background: antibody response generated malaria infections of
particular interest, since production specific igg antibodies required 
for acquisition clinical immunity. however, variations antibody responses
could result genetic polymorphism hla class ii genes. given the
increasing focus development subunit vaccines, studies influence
of class ii alleles immune response ethnically diverse populations is
important, prior implementation vaccine trials.
methods findings: study, evaluated influence hla-drb1* 
-dqb1* allelic groups naturally acquired humoral response brazilian
amazon individuals (n = 276) p. vivax merozoite surface protein-1
(msp-1), msp-3α msp-9 recombinant proteins. results provide information
concerning three p. vivax antigens, relevant role immunogenic 
surface proteins vaccine candidates. firstly, studied population was
heterogeneous presenting 13 hla-drb1* 5 dqb1* allelic groups higher
frequency hla-drb1*04 hla-dqb1*03. proteins studied broadly
immunogenic naturally exposed population high frequency igg
antibodies pvmsp1-19 (86.7%), pvmsp-3 (77%) pvmsp-9 (76%). moreover, 
hla-drb1*04 hla-dqb1*03 alleles associated higher frequency of
igg immune responses five nine antigens tested, hla-drb1*01 
was associated high frequency non-responders repetitive regions of
pvmsp-9, drb1*16 allelic group low frequency responders to
pvmsp3 full length recombinant protein.
conclusions: hla-drb1*04 alleles associated high frequency antibody 
responses five nine recombinant proteins tested rondonia state,
brazil. features could increase success rate future clinical trials 
based vaccine candidates.
