background: antigens expressed sexual stages malaria parasites are
targets transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs). hap2/gcs1, tbv candidate, 
critical fertilization plasmodium. here, genetic diversity pvhap2
was studied plasmodium vivax parasite populations greater mekong
subregion (gms).
methods: plasmodium vivax clinical isolates collected clinics the
china-myanmar border region (135 samples), western thailand (41 samples) and
western myanmar (51 samples). near full-length pvhap2 (nucleotides 13-2574) was
amplified sequenced isolates. molecular evolution studies were
conducted evaluate genetic diversity, selection population
differentiation.
results: sequencing pvhap2 gene total 227 samples three 
p. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity gene gms
(π = 0.00036 ± 0.00003), highest π value observed myanmar (0.00053 ± 
0.00009). y133s dominant mutation china-myanmar border (99.26%),
myanmar (100%) thailand (95.12%). results neutrality tests were
negative three populations, suggesting possible action of
purifying selection. codon-based tests identified specific codons under
purifying positive selections. wright's fixation index showed low moderate 
genetic differentiation p. vivax populations gms, fst ranging from
0.04077 0.24833, whereas high levels genetic differentiation detected 
between china-myanmar border iran populations (fst = 0.60266), and
between thailand iran populations (fst = 0.44161). total 20 haplotypes
were identified, h2 abundant haplotype china-myanmar border,
myanmar thailand populations. epitope mapping prediction pvhap2 antigen
showed high-score b-cell epitopes located s307-g324, l429-p453
and v623-d637 regions. e317k d637n mutations located within s307-g324 and
v623-d637 epitopes slightly reduced predicted score potential epitopes.
conclusions: present study showed low level genetic diversity of
pvhap2 gene among p. vivax populations greater mekong subregion. the
relative conservation pvhap2 supports evaluation pvhap2-based
tbv.
