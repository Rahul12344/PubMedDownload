malaria caused protozoan parasite plasmodium, leading cause of
death amongst parasitic diseases. disease transmitted human 
bites female anopheles mosquitoes. according world health organization 
(who) data, estimated 214 million malaria cases estimated
438.000 deaths occurred worldwide, 2015. observed 90% the
deaths due malaria occur africa. 78% cases children are
under five years old. intensive malaria interventions helped reduce malaria
incidence 37% 2000 2015. malaria curable disease diagnosed
and treated promptly correctly. drug resistance developed almost 
all anti-malarial drugs effective vaccine malaria been
developed yet. vaccine studies initiated 40 years ago sterile immunity against
falciparum malaria immunization exposure 1000 irradiated
mosquitoes. complex structures, complicated life cycles various antigenic
structures plasmodium species make vaccination studies difficult.
circumsporozoite protein (csp), extensively studied protein also
present content vaccine candidate rts,s currently closest 
to get license. csp first described plasmodium antigen its
important role initiation parasitic infection. csp major
surface coat protein plasmodium parasite. csp soluble protein and
recombinant form csp produced escherichia coli. nanp repeat
region target site host antibodies. recently many dna, rna protein
vaccine candidates developed malaria. according who, 
next 20 years period, malaria vaccine developed. study aimed to
produce recombinant csp (rcsp). initially, p.falciparum csp gene amplified by
pcr. csp gene cloned pjet cloning vector. gene subcloned the
pet100 protein expression vector. e.coli cells used protein expression. 
after process, purification endotoxin removal protocols performed. 
as result, 1182 bp csp gene obtained p.falciparum genomic dna.
accuracy cloning dna sequence csp gene determined dna
sequence analysis. gene sequence recorded genbank a
registration kt315396. rcsp expressed e.coli cells. existence of
rcsp verifiedwith western blot method purified removed from
endotoxins. rcsp aminoacid sequence 3d shape obtained.we believe the
production recombinant csp enable us contribute malaria
vaccine studies laboratory country.
