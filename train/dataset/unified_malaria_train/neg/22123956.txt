wolbachia maternally transmitted symbiotic bacteria spread within
insect populations unique ability manipulate host
reproduction. introduced nonnative mosquito hosts, wolbachia induce
resistance number human pathogens, including dengue virus (denv),
plasmodium, filarial nematodes, molecular mechanism involved is
unclear. study, deciphered wolbachia infection affects the
aedes aegypti host inducing resistance denv. microarray assay indicates
that transcripts genes functions related immunity and
reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions up-regulated ae. aegypti infected
with wolbachia. infection bacterium leads induction oxidative
stress increased level reactive oxygen species mosquito host.
reactive oxygen species elevation linked activation toll
pathway, essential mediating expression antioxidants to
counterbalance oxidative stress. immune pathway also responsible for
activation antimicrobial peptides-defensins cecropins. provide evidence
that antimicrobial peptides involved inhibition denv
proliferation wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. utilization transgenic ae.
aegypti rnai depletion approach instrumental proving role
of defensins cecropins resistance wolbachia-infected ae. aegypti to
denv. results indicate symbiotic bacterium manipulate host
defense system facilitate persistent infection, resulting a
compromise mosquito's ability host human pathogens. discoveries
will aid development control strategies mosquito-transmitted
diseases.
