background: namibia made significant gains fight malaria, with
a target elimination 2023. examined genotype allele frequencies 
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency inform decisions on
primaquine use, recently detected clusters plasmodium ovale curtisi in
kavango.
methods: multistaged cross-sectional sampling method used enrol 212
children 2-9 age schools clinics okavango zambezi
regions northern namibia. genotypes 202 g→a 376 a→g mutations were
assigned polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism.
results: 212 subjects enrolled, genotypes available 210, made 
of 61 males 149 females. g6pd-deficient males (hemizygotes) females
(homozygotes) constituted 3.27% (2/61) 0.0% (0/149), respectively. female
heterozygotes (aa- ba-) constituted 10.07% (15/149), g6pd wild-type
males (with b haplotype) females (with aa, bb ab haplotypes)
consisted 96.72% (59/61) 89.93% (134/149), respectively. a-, b
allele frequencies 0.0474, 0.3036 0.6490, respectively. hardy-weinberg
equilibrium tests female genotype frequencies show deviation
(p=0.29).
conclusions: frequency g6pd deficiency alleles males kavango and
zambezi regions northern namibia constitute 3.27%, first report inform
policy primaquine role out.
