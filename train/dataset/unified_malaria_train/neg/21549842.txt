malaria represents global health, economic social burden enormous
magnitude. chemotherapy moment largely effective weapon the
disease, appearance drug-resistant parasites reducing the
effectiveness drugs. finding new drug-target candidates one approach
to development new drugs. family cyclophilins may represent group
of potential targets. involved protein folding regulation due 
their peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and/or chaperone activities. also 
mediate action immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a, which
additionally strong antimalarial activity. genome database most
lethal human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum, 11 genes apparently
encoding cyclophilin cyclophilin-like proteins found, these
have yet characterized. previously pet vector conferring c-terminal 
his₆ tag used recombinant expression purification one member of
the p. falciparum cyclophilin family escherichia coli. approach was
to use identical method produce members family and
thereby allow consistent functional comparisons. successful in
generating three family, plus single amino-acid mutant, the
same recombinant form either full-length proteins isolated cyclophilin-like
domains. recombinant proteins assessed thermal melt assay correct
folding cyclosporin binding.
