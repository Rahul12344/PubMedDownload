introduction: study determined association tlr4 asp299gly and
thr399ile uncomplicated severe malaria among nigerian children of
similar ethnic background lagos. association snps high
parasite density, malnutrition, hyperpyrexia anaemia also investigated.
methods: genomic dna study participants screened genotypes 
tlr4 asp299gly thr399ile pcr-rflp. anthropometric measurement was
performed pf infected children stratified asymptomatic malaria
(control), uncomplicated severe malaria (case). parasites detected by
light microscopy hardy weinberg equilibrium (hwe) snp genotypes also
determined.
results: total 279 children comprising 182 children (62.1 % male; mean ± sem
age, 57.3 ± 1.7 months) clinical falciparum malaria 97 children (55.7 % 
male; mean ± sem age, 55.6 ± 2.5 years) asymptomatic falciparum malaria were
enrolled. genotypes tlr4 snps found study population 
with minor alleles: 299gly 399ile, found 17.6 % 14.7 % in
severe malaria children. unlike asymptomatic population, genotype
distribution tlr4 asp299gly snp hwe clinical malaria group
but condition susceptibility. however, asp299gly thr399ile
polymorphisms found increase risk severe malaria 3-fold 8-fold
respectively (p < 0.05). also increased risk severe anaemia, high
parasite density severe malnutrition 3.8 -5.3-fold, 3.3 - 4.4-fold 4-fold
respectively.
conclusions: based findings, conclude tlr4 asp299gly and
thr399ile polymorphisms may modulate susceptibility severe malaria among
nigerian children yoruba ethnic background.
