plasmodium vivax gene regulation remains difficult study due lack 
robust vitro culture method, low parasite densities peripheral circulation 
and asynchronous parasite development. adapted rna-seq protocol "daft-seq" 
to sequence transcriptome four p. vivax field isolates cultured 
for short period ex vivo using density gradient schizont
enrichment. transcription detected 78% pvp01 reference genome,
despite schizont-enriched samples. extensive data used define
thousands 5' 3' untranslated regions, overlapped with
neighbouring transcripts, improve gene models 352 genes, including 
identifying 20 novel gene transcripts. dataset also significantly
increased known amount heterogeneity p. vivax schizont
transcriptomes individual patients. majority genes found be
differentially expressed isolates lack plasmodium falciparum homologs
and predicted involved host-parasite interactions, an
enrichment reticulocyte binding proteins, merozoite surface proteins and
exported proteins unknown function. improved understanding the
diversity within p. vivax transcriptomes essential prioritisation
of novel vaccine targets.
