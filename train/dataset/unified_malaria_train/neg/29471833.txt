background: plasmodium falciparum, dominant species sub-saharan
africa, causes severe clinical malaria manifestations. in
resource-limited ghana, malaria hiv geographically overlap,
histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2)-based rapid diagnostic test (rdt) faster,
easier cheaper alternative clinical gold standard light microscopy.
however, mutations parasite hrp2 gene may result missed infections, which
have severe implications malaria control.
methods: performance common hrp2-based rdt expert light microscopy
in hiv-positive hiv-negative children 5 years old compared pcr
as laboratory gold standard. finger-prick capillary blood tested first
response® malaria ag p. falciparum (hrp2). giemsa-stained thick thin blood
films examined with ≥ 200 high power fields parasites counted per 200
white blood cells. nested pcr species identification p. falciparum was
performed resolved agarose gel. false negatives rdt further
tested deleted pfhrp2/3 flanking genes, using pcr. study was
performed two anti-retroviral therapy clinics accra atibie.
results: 401 participants enrolled, 150 hiv positive 251 hiv
negative. malaria prevalent children without hiv. microscopy a
higher sensitivity [100% (99-100)] rdt [83% (53.5-100)]. parasites with
pfhrp2/3 deletions contributed missed infections rdt false negatives.
conclusion: circulation malaria parasites pfrhp2/3 deletions this
population played role missed infections rdt. ought be
addressed strides malaria control made.
