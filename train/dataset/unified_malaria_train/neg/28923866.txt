dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) demonstrated excellent efficacy the
treatment prevention malaria uganda. however, resistance both
components regimen emerged southeast asia. efficacy of
artemether-lumefantrine, first-line regimen treat malaria uganda, has
also excellent, continued pressure may select parasites with
decreased sensitivity lumefantrine. gain insight current drug
sensitivity patterns, ex vivo sensitivities assessed genotypes
previously associated altered drug sensitivity characterized 58
isolates collected tororo, uganda, subjects presenting 2016 with
malaria community part clinical trial comparing dp
chemoprevention regimens. compared community isolates, trial
subjects lower sensitivities aminoquinolines chloroquine, monodesethyl
amodiaquine, piperaquine greater sensitivities lumefantrine and
mefloquine, observation consistent dp selection pressure. compared to
results isolates 2010 2013, sensitivities 2016 community
isolates chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine improved (geometric mean
50% inhibitory concentrations [ic50] = 248, 76.9, 19.1 nm 2010 2013 and
33.4, 14.9, 7.5 nm 2016, respectively [p < 0.001 comparisons]),
the sensitivity lumefantrine decreased (ic50 = 3.0 nm 2010 2013 5.4 
nm 2016 [p < 0.001]), sensitivity dihydroartemisinin unchanged 
(ic50 = 1.4 nm). changes accompanied decreased prevalence of
transporter mutations associated aminoquinoline resistance low
prevalence polymorphisms recently associated resistance artemisinins
or piperaquine. antimalarial drug sensitivities changing uganda, novel
genotypes associated dp treatment failure asia prevalent.
