plasmodium vivax represents second prevalent malaria species major
public health importance global eradication malaria requires the
development vaccines prevent infection. lack vitro culture 
suitable animal model p. vivax malaria major problems delay
in developing functional vivax vaccine. number antigens been
identified p. vivax potential malaria vaccine candidates among these
42kda fragment merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-142) one promising 
antigen asexual blood stage. earlier studies, msp-142 of
malaria parasites expressed insoluble protein inclusion bodies it
is difficult get purified protein conformation form. present study, 
we cloned, overexpressed characterized 42kda fragment p. vivax
msp-1 soluble protein escherichiacoli. 42kda gene fragment p. vivax 
msp-1 pcr amplified using specific primers, sequenced subcloned into
ptriex-4 expression vector. optimum expression recombinant p. vivax
protein obtained soc growth medium inducing 0.2mm iptg 37°c for
4h. sds-page analysis showed fusion protein 55kda 80% was
present soluble form. purified p. vivax msp-142 characterized and
found correctly folded conformation form evident cd
spectroscopy, presence 1 free -sh group reactivity reduction
