the attenuation plasmodium parasites either radiation targeted gene
deletion result viable sporozoites invade liver subsequently

researchers determine efficacy radiation-attenuated genetically
attenuated rodent malaria sporozoite immunizations infectious sporozoite 
challenge, study protective immunity immunized mice. addition, by
determining time arrest genetically attenuated parasite liver stages
and mechanisms clearance, researchers able correlate biological
features growth-arrested parasites ability promote
protective immunity.
