accurate timely diagnosis critical management, control and
elimination malaria. malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) improved
the diagnosis management malaria remote areas, community places
where microscopy available diagnosis. according report 2018,
plasmodium falciparum malaria constitutes 50% malaria cases in
india. rdts used diagnosis falciparum malaria today employ
hrp2 target antigen. however, low density parasitemia deletion hrp-2 
gene p. falciparum leads false negative results necessitates the
development alternative/ new improved rdt malaria diagnosis. have
analysed genetic diversity homology modelling pfgdh (glutamate
dehydrogenase), ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) aldolase genes p. falciparum
isolates eight endemic states india assess potential as
antigen rdt development. observed negligible sequence diversity pfgdh
in comparison low level diversity ldh aldolase gene. no
structural functional changes observed modelling studies three
genes negative purifying selection pressure. highly conserved
nature pfgdh gene suggests gdh could potential target molecule for
pan/pf diagnostic test malaria.
