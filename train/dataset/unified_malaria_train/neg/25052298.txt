malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) play critical role malaria case
management, surveillance case investigations. test performance largely
determined design quality characteristics, detection sensitivity, 
specificity, thermal stability. however, parasite characteristics as
variable absent expression antigens targeted rdts also affect rdt
performance. plasmodium falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 protein, most
common target antigen detection p. falciparum, reported 
regions. therefore, accurately mapping presence prevalence p.
falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 would important step rdts
targeting alternative antigens, microscopy, preferentially selected for
use regions. herein available evidence molecular basis for
identifying malaria parasites lacking pfhrp2 reviewed, set of
recommended procedures apply future investigations parasites lacking
pfhrp2, proposed.
