a central problem biology identify gene function. one approach to
infer function large supergenomic networks interactions ancestral
relationships among genes; however, analysis computationally
prohibitive. show biological networks compressible. they
can shrunk dramatically eliminating redundant evolutionary relationships,
and process efficient networks number of
compressible elements rises linearly rather exponentially other
complex networks. compression enables global network analysis to computationally 
harness hundreds interconnected genomes produce functional predictions.
as demonstration, show the essential, functionally uncharacterized 
plasmodium falciparum antigen exp1 membrane glutathione s-transferase. exp1 
efficiently degrades cytotoxic hematin, potently inhibited artesunate, 
is associated artesunate metabolism susceptibility drug-pressured
malaria parasites. data implicate exp1 mode action frontline
antimalarial drug.
