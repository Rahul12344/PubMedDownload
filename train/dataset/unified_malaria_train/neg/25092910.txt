the obligate intracellular parasite toxoplasma gondii critically relies host
cell invasion infection. proteins secreted apical micronemes 
central components host cell recognition, invasion, egress, virulence.
although previous work established sporozoite protein altered
thrombospondin repeat (spatr) micronemal protein conserved other
apicomplexan parasites, including plasmodium, neospora, eimeria, genetic
evidence contribution invasion reported. spatr contains a
predicted epidermal growth factor domain two thrombospondin type 1 repeats,
implying role host cell recognition. study, assess the
contribution t. gondii spatr (tgspatr) t. gondii invasion genetically
ablating restoring expression genetic complementation. δspatr
parasites ~50% reduced invasion compared parental strains, defect
that reversed complemented strain. mouse virulence assays, δspatr
parasites significantly attenuated, ~20% mice surviving infection.
given conservation protein among apicomplexa, assessed whether
the plasmodium falciparum spatr ortholog (pfspatr) could complement absence
of tgspatr. although pfspatr showed correct micronemal localization, did
not reverse invasion deficiency δspatr parasites, apparent
failure secretion. overall, results suggest tgspatr contributes to
invasion virulence, findings implications many genera and
life stages apicomplexans express spatr.
