identifying genetic determinants phenotypes impact disease severity
is fundamental importance design new interventions malaria.
here present rapid genome-wide approach capable identifying multiple
genetic drivers medically relevant phenotypes within malaria parasites via a
single experiment single gene allele resolution. proof principle
study, found previously undescribed single nucleotide polymorphism in
the binding domain erythrocyte binding like protein (ebl) conferred a
dramatic change red blood cell invasion mutant rodent malaria parasites
plasmodium yoelii. experiment, implicated merozoite surface
protein 1 (msp1) polymorphic proteins, major targets of
strain-specific immunity. using allelic replacement, provide functional
validation substitution ebl gene controlling growth rate the
blood stages parasites.
