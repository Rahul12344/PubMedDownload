the recent emergence artemisinin-resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria in
western cambodia could threaten prospects malaria elimination. identification
of genetic basis resistance would provide tools molecular
surveillance, aiding efforts contain resistance. clinical trials artesunate
efficacy conducted bangladesh, northwestern thailand near myanmar 
border, two sites western cambodia. parasites collected trial
participants genotyped 8,079 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) using
a p. falciparum-specific snp array. parasite genotypes examined for
signatures recent positive selection association parasite clearance
phenotypes identify regions genome associated artemisinin
resistance. four snps chromosomes 10 (one), 13 (two), 14 (one) were
significantly associated delayed parasite clearance. two snps on
chromosome 13 region genome appears strong
recent positive selection cambodia. snps chromosomes 10 13 lie in
or near genes involved postreplication repair, dna damage-tolerance pathway.
replication validation studies needed refine location loci
responsible artemisinin resistance understand mechanism behind it;
however, two snps chromosomes 10 13 may useful markers delayed
parasite clearance surveillance artemisinin resistance southeast asia.
