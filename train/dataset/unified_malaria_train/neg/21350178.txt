metarhizium anisopliae infects mosquitoes cuticle proliferates in
the hemolymph. allow m. anisopliae combat malaria mosquitoes with
advanced malaria infections, produced recombinant strains expressing molecules
that target sporozoites travel hemolymph salivary
glands. eleven days plasmodium-infected blood meal, mosquitoes were
treated m. anisopliae expressing salivary gland midgut peptide 1 (sm1), 
which blocks attachment sporozoites salivary glands; single-chain
antibody agglutinates sporozoites; scorpine, antimicrobial
toxin. reduced sporozoite counts 71%, 85%, 90%, respectively. m.
anisopliae expressing scorpine [sm1](8):scorpine fusion protein reduced
sporozoite counts 98%, suggesting metarhizium-mediated inhibition of
plasmodium development could powerful weapon combating malaria.
