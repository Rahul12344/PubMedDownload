background: arabian peninsula malaria control progressing steadily,
backed adequate logistic political support. result, transmission 
been interrupted throughout region, exception limited sites yemen 
and saudi arabia. examined plasmodium falciparum parasites sites
to assess success limited diversity gene flow.
methods: examined 108 p. falciparum isolates three sites yemen (taiz,
dhamar hodeidah) 91 isolates saudi arabia (jazan). nine
microsatellites analyzed allelic diversity, multi-locus haplotype and
inter-population differentiation.
results: diversity locus (unbiased heterozygosity [h]) relatively
lower yemen; (hodeidah, h=0.615, taiz, h=0.66, dhamar, h=0.481), compared to
saudi arabia (jazan, h=0.76). microsatellites distributed widely private
alleles, detected single population, rare. pairwise comparisons
revealed parasites population dhamar relatively distanced (fst=0.19).
however, taiz (yemen) (fst=0.065) hodeidah (fst=0.107) populations were
closer jazan (saudi arabia). nonetheless, parasites four sites 
can considered one population.
conclusion: although malaria risk saudi arabia cut considerably, 
extent diversity parasite genetic structure indicative large
population size. elimination strategy target demographic factors that
favor parasite dispersal flow imported malaria.
