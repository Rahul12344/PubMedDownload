insect-symbiont interactions known play key roles host functions and
fitness. common insect endosymbiont wolbachia reduce ability of
several human pathogens, including arboviruses malaria parasite, to
replicate insect hosts. wolbachia naturally infect aedes aegypti, the
primary vector dengue virus, transinfected ae. aegypti antidengue
virus properties currently trialled dengue biocontrol
strategy. here, assess impact wolbachia infection ae. aegypti the
microbiome wild mosquito populations (adults larvae) collected from
release sites cairns, australia, profiling 16s rrna gene using
next-generation sequencing. data indicate wolbachia reduces relative
abundance large proportion bacterial taxa ae. aegypti adults, 
in accordance known pathogen-blocking effects wolbachia variety 
of bacteria viruses. adults, several abundant bacterial genera
were found undergo significant shifts relative abundance. however, the
genera showing greatest changes relative abundance wolbachia-infected
adults represented low proportion total microbiome. addition, there
was little effect wolbachia infection relative abundance bacterial
taxa larvae, species diversity (accounting species richness and
evenness together) detected adults larvae. results offer insight into
the effects wolbachia ae. aegypti microbiome native setting, an
important consideration field releases wolbachia population.
