background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) detect histidine-rich protein 2
(pfhrp2) used throughout africa diagnosis plasmodium falciparum
malaria. however, recent reports indicate parasites lacking pfhrp2
and/or histidine-rich protein 3 (pfhrp3) genes, produce antigens detected
by rdts, common select regions south america, asia, africa.
proving absence gene challenging, multiple pcr assays targeting
these genes described. detailed characterization comparison of
published assays needed facilitate robust streamlined testing
approaches.
results: among six pfhrp2 pfhrp3 pcr assays tested, lower limit of
detection ranged 0.01 pg/µl 0.1 ng/µl p. falciparum 3d7 strain dna, or
approximately 0.4-4000 parasite genomes/µl. lowering elongation
temperature 60 °c, tenfold improvement limit detection and/or
darker bands exon 1 targets first-round reaction single 
exon 2 target achieved. additionally, assays targeting exon 1 either gene 
yielded spurious amplification paralogous gene. using data, an
optimized testing algorithm detection pfhrp2- pfhrp3-negative p.
falciparum proposed.
conclusions: surveillance pfhrp2- pfhrp3-negative p. falciparum requires
careful laboratory workflows. pcr-based testing methods coupled microscopy
and/or antigen testing serve useful tools support policy development.
standardized approaches detection pfhrp2- pfhrp3-negative p.
falciparum inform efforts define impact parasites.
