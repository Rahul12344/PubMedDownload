how immunity malaria develops remains one great unresolved issues in
bio-medicine resolution various paradoxes likely key to
developing effective malaria vaccines. basic epidemiological observations
are; conditions intense natural transmission, humans become immune to
p. falciparum malaria, slow process requiring multiple disease
episodes many, particularly young children, survive. adult survivors
are immune symptoms malaria, unless pregnant, control the
growth new inoculations. sterile immunity achieved and
chronic parasitization apparently healthy adults norm. article,
we analyse best understood malaria "antigenic variation" system, based
on plasmodium falciparum's pfemp1-type cytoadhesion antigens, critically
review recent literature function control multi-gene family of
parasite variable surface antigens.
