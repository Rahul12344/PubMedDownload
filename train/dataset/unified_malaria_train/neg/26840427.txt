apicomplexan parasites replicate several budding mechanisms two
well-characterized examples toxoplasma endodyogeny plasmodium
schizogony. completion budding requires tapering nascent daughter
buds toward basal end, driven contraction basal complex. this
contraction executed known cell division associated
contractile mechanisms order reveal new components unusual basal
complex performed yeast two-hybrid screen major scaffolding
protein, tgmorn1. report conserved protein haloacid
dehalogenase (had) phosphatase domain, hereafter named had2a, identified yeast
two-hybrid. had2a demonstrated enzyme-activity vitro, localizes the
nascent daughter buds, co-localizes morn1 basal complex during
its contraction. conditional knockout had2a toxoplasma interferes with
basal complex assembly, leads incomplete cytokinesis conjoined
daughters ultimately results disrupted proliferation. plasmodium, we
further confirmed localization had2a ortholog basal complex toward 
the end schizogony. conclusion, work highlights essential role for
this phosphatase across apicomplexan budding suggests regulatory
mechanism differential phosphorylation structure and/or contractile
function basal complex.
