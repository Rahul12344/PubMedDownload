rare earth elements play pivotal role high-technology devices, used as
contrast agents magnetic resonance imaging clinical settings, explored
as drug carriers tumor photodynamic therapy, used fertilizers.
from biochemical viewpoint, act antagonists ca2+ have
been proposed alternative ca2+ metallo-enzymes, particular ce3+
-based methanol dehydrogenases (mdhs). now, analysis protein
sequence databases identified ce3+ -based mhds archea bacteria. here,
we report evidence ce3+ -based mdhs also present higher organisms.
these enzymes, identified parasite plasmodium yoelii yoelii, spider
nephila clavipes, tibetan antelope pantholops hodgsonii, homo
sapiens, encoded intronless genes, thus representing case multiple,
independent lateral gene transfer prokaryotes eukaryotes. the
conservation residues involved ce3+ coordination, pyrroquinoline
quinone cofactor recognition structure stabilization suggests that
these enzymes belong ce3+ -dependent mdh family, hitherto considered as
exclusive prokaryotes. © 2018 iubmb life, 70(11):1067-1075, 2018.
