background: immunoassays plasmodium detection are, presently, frequently
based monoclonal antibodies (mabs); polyclonal antibodies (pabs), are
cheaper develop manufacture, much less frequently used. present
study describe sandwich elisa assay capable detecting p. vivax
lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) clinical blood samples, without cross reacting
with infected p. falciparum.
methods: two recombinant proteins produced different regions p. 
vivax ldh gene. two sandwich elisa assay designed: one uses mouse
anti-ldh 1-43aa pabs primary antibodies ("test 1") another uses
anti-ldh 35-305aa pabs ("test 2") primary antibodies. rabbit anti-ldh
1-43aa pabs used capture antibodies elisa assays. blood samples
taken p. vivax p. falciparum infected patients (confirmed light
microscopy) analysed using tests.
results: "test 2" performed better detecting microscopy-positive blood samples
when compared "test 1", identifying 131 154 positive samples (85%); 85
positives (55%) identified using "test 1". "test 1" produced one false
positive sample (from 20 malaria-free control) blood samples; "test 2"
produced none. kappa coefficient analysis results produced value of
0.267 microscope-positive blood smears compared "test 1", but
0.734 microscope-positive blood smears compared results from
"test 2". positive predictive value (ppv) negative predictive value (npv)
were observed 98% 22% respectively, "test 1", 99% 45%, 
"test 2". cross reactivity detected p. falciparum positive blood
samples (n = 15) either test assay.
conclusion: tests detected p. vivax infected blood showed evidence of
cross-reacting p. falciparum. studies need conducted to
establish full potential technique malaria diagnostics. well
as representing promising new cost-effective novel technique p. vivax
diagnosis research, method developing assay also highlights 
potential pab-based strategies diagnostics general.
