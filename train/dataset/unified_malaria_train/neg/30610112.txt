sequestration plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ie) within the
brain microvasculature hallmark cerebral malaria (cm). using a
microchannel flow adhesion assay tnf-activated primary human microvascular
endothelial cells, demonstrate ie isolated malawian paediatric cm
cases showed increased binding brain microvascular endothelial cells compared 
to ie uncomplicated malaria (um) cases. further, um isolates showed
significantly greater adhesion dermal brain microvascular endothelial 
cells. major mediator parasite adhesion p. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1, encoded var genes. higher levels var gene transcripts
predicted bind host endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) icam-1 were
detected cm isolates. data provide evidence differential
tissue binding severe uncomplicated malaria syndromes, give additional
support hypothesis cm pathology based increased cytoadherence
of ie brain microvasculature.
