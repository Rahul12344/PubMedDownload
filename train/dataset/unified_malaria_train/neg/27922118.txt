genomics data miner (gmine) user-friendly online software allows
non-experts mine, cluster compare multidimensional biomolecular datasets. 
various powerful visualization techniques provided, generating high quality
figures directly incorporated scientific publications. robust
and comprehensive analyses provided via broad range data-mining
techniques, including univariate multivariate statistical analysis,
supervised learning, correlation networks, clustering multivariable
regression. software focus multivariate techniques, can
attribute variance measurements multiple explanatory variables and
confounders. various normalization methods provided. extensive help pages and
a tutorial available via wiki server. using gmine reanalyzed proteome
microarray data host antibody response plasmodium falciparum. our
results support hypothesis immunity malaria higher-order
phenomenon related pattern responses attributable single
antigen. also analyzed gene expression across resting activated cells,
identifying many immune-related genes differential expression. this
highlights plasticity cells operation hardwired
activation program. application examples demonstrate gmine facilitates
an accurate in-depth analysis complex molecular datasets, including
genomics, transcriptomics proteomics data.
