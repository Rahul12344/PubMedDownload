this descriptive comparative review examines changing epidemiology,
treatment, renal patient outcome childhood nephrotic syndrome (ns) in
tropical africa (tpafr). 1960s 1980s, corticosteroid-resistant
non-minimal change disease (nmcd) including quartan malaria nephropathy (qmn) was
the dominant renal histopathology type. overall incidence ns was
0.35-1.34% hospital admissions. median age onset ns ranged 4.0
and 12.0 years mean (sd) age range 5.8 (3.8) 10.3 (4.8) years
across studies. male: female ratio 1.6:1.0. overall mean (sd)
incidence idiopathic minimal change disease (mcd) [21.6 (18.6%)] compared with
idiopathic nmcd [59.1 (25.7%)] demonstrates significant dominance latter
(p = 0.0001). post-1989, following mean (sd) incidences histopathological 
types were: mcd 20.4 (17.7%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 39.0 (26.3%),
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 25.4 (16.8%), proliferative
glomerulonephritis 16.7 (27.0%) membranous nephropathy 7.4 (4.5%). 
mean (sd) proportion steroid resistance (sr) [73.5 (19.2%)] significantly 
greater mean complete remission (cr) [26.5 (19.2%)] 1960-1989
(p=0.005), mean (sd) sr [27.4 (25.3%)] significantly lower mean (sd) cr 
[66.1 (28.0%)] post-1989 (p < 0.001). unlike qmn, hepatitis b virus, hiv
infection, sickle cell disease systemic lupus erythematosus now
increasingly associated ns tpafr. mean (sd) renal survival
post-1989 58.3 (37.0%) all-cause mortality 9.8%. children ns
now survive better before, reflecting improved access healthcare and
transition clinical pattern favouring idiopathic ns increased
