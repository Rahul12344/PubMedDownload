histones, packaging organizing dna chromatin, serve essential 
building blocks eukaryotic life. basic structure chromatin is
established four canonical histones (h2a, h2b, h3 h4), histone
variants commonly utilized alter properties specific chromatin
domains. h3.3, variant histone h3, found diverse localization
patterns functions across species rather poorly studied in
protists. present first genome-wide analysis h3.3 the
malaria-causing, apicomplexan parasite, p. falciparum, revealed complex
occupancy profile consisting conserved parasite-specific features. in
contrast histone variants, pfh3.3 primarily demarcates euchromatic
coding subtelomeric repetitive sequences. stable occupancy pfh3.3 these
regions largely uncoupled transcriptional activity appears 
primarily dependent gc-content underlying dna. importantly, pfh3.3 
specifically marks promoter region active poised, inactive 
antigenic variation (var) gene, thereby potentially contributing immune
evasion. collectively, data suggest pfh3.3, together histone 
variants, indexes p. falciparum genome functionally distinct domains and
contribute key survival strategy deadly pathogen.
