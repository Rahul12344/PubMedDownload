background: apical membrane antigen 1 (ama-1) positioned surface of
merozoite may play role attack red blood cells. main aim of
present study determine genetic variation, well as, detect of
selection domain ama-1 gene plasmodium vivax isolates iran.
methods: blood samples collected 58 patients positive p. vivax,
mono infection domain ama-1 gene amplified nested pcr and
then sequenced.
results: total 33 different haplotypes identified among 58 iranian
sequences. 23 new haplotypes determined study not
reported previously regions world. totally observed 36
point mutations nucleotide level analyzed sequences. sequences
analyses indicated 25 amino acid changes 20 positions 5 sites
demonstrated thrimorphic polymorphism others dimorphic domain
i iranian pvama-1 isolates.
conclusion: findings indicated relatively high level allelic diversity 
the domain pvama-1 among p.vivax isolates iran. since, pvama-1 is
considering vaccine candidate antigen, data provide valuable information
for development pvama-1 based malaria vaccine.
