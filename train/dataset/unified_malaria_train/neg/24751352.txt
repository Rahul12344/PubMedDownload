background: 2006, first-line anti-malarial drug treatment tanzania 
changed sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) artemether-lumefantrine (alu), an
artemisinin-based combination (act), since use sp restricted
for intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp). number plasmodium
falciparum mutations known associated resistance sp, 
not known prevalence mutations increasing decreasing 
the conditions reduced levels sp use. study reports current sp 
resistant quintuple pfdhfr-pfdhps mutations six regions tanzania.
methods: finger-prick blood filter paper rapid diagnostic test strips from
p. falciparum-positive individuals age groups attending health facilities 
in six regions tanzania june 2010 august 2011 obtained. using
chelex-100 extracted dna, genotyping done mutations codons 51, 59 
108 pfdhfr 437 540 pfdhps genes using pcr-rflp technique.
results: total 802 malaria-positive samples screened genotyped. the
prevalence pfdhfr 51i, pfdhps 437g 540e varied regions (p <
0.001) whereas pfdhfr 59r (fe 10.79, p = 0.225) 108 n (fe 10.61, p = 0.239)
did vary regions. pfdhfr triple mutant 84% and
close fixation levels regions, whereas pfdhps double mutation
ranged 43.8 97% regions. quintuple mutant (irnge) the
most prevalent regions varied significantly 37.5 90.2%
(Ï‡(2) = 1.11, p <0.001).
conclusions: evidence persistent high levels sp resistance markers
in tanzania evidence quintuple mutations likely become fixed 
in population. threatens future sp iptp programmes,
but combination drug act. continuous monitoring sp-iptp efficacy
should encouraged subsequent searching alternative drugs iptp in
east africa.
