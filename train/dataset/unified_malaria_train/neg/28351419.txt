background: encoded var gene family, highly variable plasmodium falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (pfemp1) proteins mediate tissue-specific
cytoadherence infected erythrocytes, resulting immune evasion severe
malaria disease. sequencing assembling 40-60 var gene complement for
individual infections notoriously difficult, impeding molecular
epidemiological studies assessment particular var elements subunit 
vaccine candidates.
methods: developed validated novel algorithm, exon-targeted hybrid
assembly (etha), perform targeted assembly var gene sequences, based a
combination pacific biosciences illumina data.
results: using etha, characterized repertoire var genes 12 samples
from uncomplicated malaria infections children single malian village
and showed genetically diverse vars isolates around
the globe. gene var2csa, member var family associated placental
malaria pathogenesis, present genome, vars previously
associated severe malaria.
conclusion: etha, tool discover novel var sequences clinical samples,
will aid understanding malaria pathogenesis inform design of
malaria vaccines based pfemp1. etha available at:
