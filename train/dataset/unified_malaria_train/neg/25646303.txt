the costimulatory molecule cd40 enhances immunity several distinct roles 
in cell activation cell interaction immune cells. mouse
model immunity liver stage plasmodium infection, cd40 critical 
full maturation liver dendritic cells, accumulation cd8(+) cells the
liver, protective immunity induced immunization plasmodium yoelii
fabb/f(-) genetically attenuated parasite. using mixed adoptive transfers of
polyclonal wild-type cd40-deficient cd8(+) cells wild-type and
cd40-deficient hosts, evaluated contributions cd8(+) cell immunity of
cd40 expressed host tissues including apc, compared cd40 expressed the
cd8(+) cells themselves. effects cd40 could accounted 
expression cells' environment, including accumulation large
numbers cd8(+) cells livers immunized mice. thus, protective
immunity generated immunization fabb/f(-) largely dependent on
effective apc licensing via cd40 signaling.
