intraerythrocytic development human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
appears continuous flow growth proliferation. develop a
greater understanding critical regulatory events, utilized piggybac
insertional mutagenesis randomly disrupt genes. screening collection of
piggybac mutants slow growth, isolated attenuated parasite c9, which
carried single insertion disrupting open reading frame (orf) of
pf3d7_1305500. gene encodes protein structurally similar a
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) phosphatase, except two notable
characteristics alter signature motif dual-specificity
phosphatase domain, suggesting may low-activity phosphatase or
pseudophosphatase. c9 parasites demonstrated significantly lower growth rate
with delayed entry s/m phase cell cycle, follows stage 
of maximum pf3d7_1305500 expression intact parasites. genetic complementation 
with full-length pf3d7_1305500 rescued wild-type phenotype c9,
validating importance putative protein phosphatase pf3d7_1305500 
regulator pre-s-phase cell cycle progression p. falciparum.
