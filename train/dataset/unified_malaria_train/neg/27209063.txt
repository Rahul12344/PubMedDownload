background: present paper reports studies evaluated
artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (as + sp) first-line drug and
artemether-lumefantrine (al) second-line drug uncomplicated
falciparum malaria sudan. evaluation performed twenty studies
covering six sentinel sites five successive annual malaria transmission
seasons 2010 2015.
methods: standard world health organization protocol used follow-up
period 28 days. frequency distribution molecular markers antifolate
resistance dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) 
genes studied pre-treatment samples four sites 2011.
results: nine studies al conducted five sites (n = 595), high
pcr-corrected cure rates found, ranging 96.8 100 %. among eleven
studies as + sp (n = 1013), decline pcr-corrected cure rates was
observed gedaref eastern sudan: 91.0 % 2011-12 season 86.5 % 
the 2014-15 season. remaining sites, as + sp cure rates ranged between
95.6 100 %. rate clearance microscopic gametocytaemia after
treatment significantly different al as + sp days 7, 14, 21
and 28 follow-up. total 371 pre-treatment samples analysed for
molecular markers sp resistance. temporal changes geographical
differences frequency distribution sp-resistance genotypes showed
evidence regional differentiation selection resistant strains.
conclusion: findings study call need review sudan
malaria treatment policy. epidemiological factors could play major role 
emergence drug-resistant malaria eastern sudan.
