malaria control relies first-line treatments use artemisinin-combination 
therapies (act). unfortunately, mutations plasmodium falciparum kelch13
gene result delayed parasite clearance. research causing act
failure non-existent northwestern nigeria. thus, presence mutations 
in kelch13 p. falciparum isolates kano, nigeria investigated 
study. microscopic examination 154 blood samples obtained patients
revealed high prevalence p. falciparum infection (114 positive individuals, 
slide positivity rate = 74.03%). 114 patients administered cartefÂ® (act)
and 50 patients returned 14-day follow up, 11 were
positive p. falciparum (slide positivity rate = 22%). day 0, 80 samples
out 114 11 samples day 14 (91 125 microscopy-positive samples)
were positive plasmodium according pcr cytochrome oxidase i, which
corresponds 72.8%. fragment kelch13 gene encompassing propeller
domains sequenced 49 samples, alongside samples susceptible strain 
pf_3d7. low polymorphism observed, suggesting lack selection this
gene, six mutations (glu433gly, phe434ile, phe434ser, ile684asn,
ile684thr glu688lys) found. epidemiologic impact mutations 
and potential role act resistance needs investigated further.
