ackr1, located chromosome 1q23.2, gene encodes glycoprotein
expressing duffy blood group antigens. gene transcribed two mrna
variants yielding two isoforms, encoding proteins 338 336 amino acids.
this review provides general overview duffy blood group characterise 
and elucidate genetic basis system. fya fyb antigens are
encoded co-dominant fy*a (fy*01) fy*b (fy*02) alleles, differ by
c.125g>a (rs12075), defining fy(a+b-), fy(a-b+) fy(a+b+) phenotypes. 
fy(a-b-) phenotype occurs africans provides explanation the
apparent absence plasmodium vivax region: phenotype arises from
homozygosity fy*b allele carrying point mutation c.1-67t>c (rs2814778),
which prevents fyb antigen expression red blood cells. mutation 
has also found fy*a allele, rare. fy(a-b-)
phenotype europeans asians arises mutations coding region of
the fy*a fy*b allele, preventing duffy antigen expression cell the
body thus true duffy null phenotypes. according international
society blood transfusion, ten alleles associated null
expression fy antigens. furthermore, different allelic forms fy*b
modify fyb antigen expression, may result weak equivocal
serology results. mostly common found variants, c.265c>t (rs34599082) and
c.298g>a (rs13962) -previously defined combination fy*b allele -
have already observed fy*a allele. thus, six alleles been
recognised associated weak expression fy antigens. considering
the importance duffy blood group system clinical medicine, additional
studies via molecular biology approaches must performed resolve clarify
the discrepant results present erythrocyte phenotyping.
