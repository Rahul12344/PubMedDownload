artemisinins revolutionized treatment plasmodium falciparum malaria; 
however, resistance threatens undermine global control efforts. broadly
explore artemisinin susceptibility apicomplexan parasites, employ
genome-scale crispr screens recently developed toxoplasma gondii discover 
sensitizing desensitizing mutations. using sublethal concentration of
dihydroartemisinin (dha), uncover putative transporter tmem14c whose
disruption increases dha susceptibility. screens performed high doses of
dha provide evidence mitochondrial metabolism modulate resistance. we
show disrupting top candidate screens, mitochondrial protease
degp2, lowers porphyrin levels decreases dha susceptibility, without
significantly altering parasite fitness culture. deleting homologous gene 
in p. falciparum, pfdegp, similarly lowers heme levels dha susceptibility.
these results expose vulnerability heme metabolism genetic
perturbations lead increased survival presence dha.
