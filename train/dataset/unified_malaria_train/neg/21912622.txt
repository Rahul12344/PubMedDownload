background: plasmodium infection increases oxidative stress inside the
mosquito, leading significant alteration transcription anopheles
gambiae detoxification genes. among detoxification genes several p450
cytochromes tubulins differently expressed, suggesting involvement
in mosquito's response parasite invasion. p450 cytochromes usually
involved metabolism detoxification several compounds, also 
regulated several pathogens, including malaria parasite. tubulins are
extremely important components cytoskeleton, rearrangement
functions response malaria parasite invasion.
methodology/principal findings: gene silencing methods used uncover the
effects cytochrome p450 reductase, tubulina tubulinb silencing a.
gambiae response plasmodium berghei invasion. role tubulins counter 
infection processes also investigated inhibiting effect. colchicine,
vinblastine paclitaxel, three different tubulin inhibitors injected into
a. gambiae mosquitoes. twenty-four hours post injection mosquitoes were
infected p. berghei blood meal infected cd1 mice. cytochrome 
p450 gene expression measured using rt-qpcr detect differences in
cytochrome expression silenced, inhibited control mosquitoes. results
showed cytochrome p450 reductase silencing, well tubulin (a b)
silencing inhibition affected efficiency plasmodium infection.
silencing inhibition also affected expression levels cytochromes p450.
conclusions: results suggest existence relationship tubulins
and p450 cytochromes a. gambiae immune response p. berghei invasion.
one p450 cytochromes study, cyp6z2, stands potential
link association. work needed fully understand role 
tubulin genes response plasmodium infection.
