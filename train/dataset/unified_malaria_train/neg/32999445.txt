regulatory genes often multifunctional constrained, results in
evolutionary conservation. difficult understand regulatory gene
could lost one species' genome essential viability in
closely related species. gene paired classic drosophila pair-rule gene, 
required formation alternate body segments diverse insect species.
surprisingly, paired lost mosquitoes without disrupting body patterning.
here, demonstrate paired family member, gooseberry, acquired
paired-like expression malaria mosquito anopheles stephensi.
anopheles-gooseberry crispr-cas9 knock-out mutants display pair-rule phenotypes
and alteration target gene expression similar seen drosophila
and beetle paired mutants. thus, paired functionally replaced related 
gene, gooseberry, mosquitoes. findings document rare example a
functional replacement essential regulatory gene provide mechanistic 
explanation loss occur.
