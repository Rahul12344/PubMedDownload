functionally constrained genes ideal insecticide targets disruption
is often fatal, resistance mutations typically costly. synaptic
acetylcholinesterase (ache) essential neurotransmission enzyme targeted 
insecticides used increasingly malaria control. anopheles culex
mosquitoes, glycine-serine substitution codon 119 ace-1 gene confers 
both resistance fitness costs, especially 119s/s homozygotes. g119s in
anopheles gambiae accra (ghana) strongly associated resistance, and,
despite expectations cost, resistant 119s alleles increasing significantly
in frequency. sequencing accra females detected single ace-1 119s
haplotype, whereas 119g diversity high overall low non-synonymous
sites, evidence strong purifying selection driven functional constraint.
flanking microsatellites showed reduced diversity, elevated linkage
disequilibrium high differentiation 119s, relative 119g homozygotes
across two megabases genome. yet signals selection were
inconsistent sometimes weak tens kilobases ace-1. unexpected
finding attributable apparently ubiquitous amplification 119s alleles as
part large copy number variant (cnv) far exceeding size ace-1
gene, whereas 119g alleles unduplicated. ace-1 cnv detectable in
archived samples collected 119s allele rare ghana. multicopy
amplification resistant alleles observed previously likely
to underpin recent increase 119s frequency. large cnv compromised
localization strong selective sweep around ace-1, emphasizing need 
integrate cnv analysis genome scans selection.
