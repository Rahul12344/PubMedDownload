multiple kelch13 alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (art-r) currently 
spreading southeast asian malaria parasite populations, providing a
unique opportunity observe ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why
resistance alleles evolved multiple times determine fundamental
population genetic parameters plasmodium sequenced kelch13 (n = 1,876),
genotyped 75 flanking snps, measured clearance rate (n = 3,552) parasite
infections western thailand (2001-2014). describe 32 independent coding
mutations including common mutations outside kelch13 propeller associated
with significant reductions clearance rate. mutations first observed in
2003 rose 90% 2014, consistent selection coefficient ∼0.079. 
art-r allele diversity rose 2012 dropped one allele (c580y)
spread high frequency. frequency adaptive alleles arise is
determined rate mutation population size. two factors drive
this soft sweep: (1) multiple kelch13 amino-acid mutations confer resistance
providing large mutational target-we estimate target 87-163 bp. (2) 
population mutation parameter (θ = 2neμ) estimated frequency
distribution art-r alleles ∼5.69, suggesting short term effective 
population size 88 thousand 1.2 million. 52-705 times greater 
ne estimated fluctuation allele frequencies, suggesting have
previously underestimated capacity adaptive evolution plasmodium our
central conclusions retrospective studies may underestimate the
complexity selective events ne relevant adaptation malaria 
considerably higher previously estimated.
