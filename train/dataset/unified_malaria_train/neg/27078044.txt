in vivo photoacoustic (pa) flow cytometry (pafc) already demonstrated great
potential diagnosis deadly diseases ultrasensitive detection
of rare disease-associated circulating markers whole blood volume. here, we
demonstrate first application powerful technique early diagnosis 
of malaria label-free detection malaria parasite-produced hemozoin 
infected red blood cells (irbcs) high-contrast pa agent. existing malaria 
tests using blood smears detect disease 0.001-0.1% parasitemia. 
the contrary, linear pafc showed potential noninvasive malaria diagnosis at
an extremely low level parasitemia 0.0000001%, ∼10(3) times better
than existing tests. multicolor time-of-flight pafc high-pulse
repetition rate lasers wavelengths 532, 671, 820 nm demonstrated rapid 
spectral spatial identification quantitative enumeration individual
irbcs. integration pafc fluorescence flow cytometry (ffc) provided
real-time simultaneous detection single irbcs parasites expressing green
fluorescence proteins, respectively. combination linear nonlinear
nanobubble-based multicolor pafc showed capability real-time control therapy
efficiency counting irbcs before, during, treatment. results 
suggest high-sensitivity, high-resolution ultrafast pafc-ffc platform
represents powerful research tool provide insight malaria progression
through dynamic study parasite-cell interactions directly bloodstream,
whereas portable hand-worn pafc device could broadly used humans early 
malaria diagnosis. © 2016 international society advancement cytometry.
