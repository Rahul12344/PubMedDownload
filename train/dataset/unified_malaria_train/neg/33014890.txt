the disease may useful developing new treatment strategies. mouse
enu-induced mutagenesis screen novel malaria resistance-conferring mutations 
identified novel non-sense mutation gene encoding porphobilinogen
deaminase (pbgd) mice, denoted pbgd mri58155. heterozygote pbgd
mri58155 mice exhibited ~50% reduction cellular pbgd activity mature
erythrocytes reticulocytes, although enzyme activity ~10 times higher 
reticulocytes erythrocytes. challenged blood-stage p. chabaudi,
which preferentially infects erythrocytes, heterozygote mice showed modest 
significant resistance infection, including reduced parasite growth. series 
of assays conducted investigate mechanism resistance indicated that
mutant erythrocyte invasion p. chabaudi normal, following
intraerythrocytic establishment significantly greater proportions parasites 
died therefore, affected ability propagate. plasmodium
resistance phenotype recapitulated pbgd-deficient mice infected with
p. berghei, prefers reticulocytes, p. falciparum cultured in
erythrocytes patients acute intermittent porphyria (aip), had
modest (20-50%) reduced levels pbgd. furthermore, growth pbgd-null p.
falciparum pbgd-null p. berghei parasites, grew rate as
their wild-type counterparts normal cells, affected the
pbgd-deficient background aip erythrocytes pbgd-deficient mice. our
results confirm dispensability parasite pbgd p. berghei infection
