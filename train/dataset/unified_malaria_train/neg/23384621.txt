resistance plasmodium vivax blood-stage infection widely recognised
to result absence duffy (fy) blood group surface red
blood cells (rbcs) individuals african descent. interestingly, recent
studies different malaria-endemic regions begun reveal new
perspectives association duffy gene polymorphism p. vivax
malaria. papua new guinea americas, heterozygous carriers a
duffy-negative allele less susceptible p. vivax infection than
duffy-positive homozygotes. brazil, studies show fy(a) antigen,
compared fy(b), associated lower binding p. vivax duffy-binding
protein reduced susceptibility vivax malaria. additionally, is
interesting numerous studies shown p. vivax infect rbcs
and cause clinical disease duffy-negative people. suggests the
relationship p. vivax duffy antigen complex than
customarily described. evidence p. vivax duffy-independent red cell invasion
indicates parasite must evolving alternative red cell invasion
pathways. chapter, review evidence p. vivax duffy-dependent
and duffy-independent red cell invasion. also consider influence of
further host gene polymorphism associated malaria endemicity on
susceptibility vivax malaria. interaction parasite rbc
has significant potential influence effectiveness p. vivax-specific
vaccines drug treatments. ultimately, relationships red cell
polymorphisms p. vivax blood-stage infection influence estimates 
the population risk efforts eliminate vivax malaria.
