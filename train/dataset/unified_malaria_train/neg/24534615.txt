during last decade, vast number inhibitors, ligands fluorescent
probes evolved mammalian protein kinases; however, suitability of
these compounds studies evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes mostly
been left beyond scope research. here, examined whether adenosine
analogue-oligoarginine conjugates extensively characterized as
efficient inhibitors human protein kinases applicable targeting
plasmodium protein kinases. demonstrated arcs able bind 
to inhibit representative member plasmodium falciparum kinome
(cgmp-dependent protein kinase) biochemical assay, also affected the
general phosphorylation levels parasites released infected red blood 
cells upon saponin treatment. findings urge advantaging already existing
biochemical tools, whose initially generic, intrinsically "tunable"
selectivity profiles could used dissection signaling pathways outside
the initially defined group biological targets.
