cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) important signalling molecule across 
evolution, recently little information role malaria
parasites. advances gene editing - particular conditional genetic
approaches mass spectrometry paved way characterisation the
key components camp signalling pathway malaria parasites. has
revealed camp signalling plays critical role invasion host red blood
cells plasmodium falciparum merozoites regulating phosphorylation 
of key parasite proteins camp-dependent protein kinase (pka). these
insights help us investigate parasite camp signalling target for
novel antimalarial drugs.
