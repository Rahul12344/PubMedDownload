protozoa diverse group unicellular eukaryotes. evidence accumulated 
that protozoan aquaporin water solute channels (aqp) contribute adaptation
in changing environments. intracellular protozoan parasites live well-sheltered
life. plasmodium spp. express single aqp, toxoplasma gondii two, while
trypanosoma cruzi leishamnia spp. encode five aqps. aqps are
thought import metabolic precursors simultaneously dispose waste and
to help parasites survive osmotic stress transmission the
insect vector kidney passages. trypanosoma brucei protozoan
parasite swims freely human blood. expression intracellular
localization three t. brucei aqps depend stage differentiation
during life cycle, suggesting distinct roles energy generation,
metabolism, cell motility. free-living amoebae direct contact the
environment, encountering severe sudden changes availability of
nutrition, osmotic conditions due rainfall drought. amoeba
proteus expresses single aqp present contractile vacuole complex
required osmoregulation, whereas dictyostelium discoideum expresses four
aqps, two present single-celled amoeboidal stage two more
in later multicellular stages preceding spore formation. number and
regulation protozoan aquaporins may reflect environmental complexity. we
highlight gated aqpb d. discoideum example life wild
is challenged complex aqp structure-function relationship.
