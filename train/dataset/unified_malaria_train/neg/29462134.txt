triatomines hematophagous arthropod vectors trypanosoma cruzi, the
causative agent chagas disease. panstrongylus lignarius, also known as
panstrongylus herreri, considered one versatile triatomines
because parasitize different hosts, found different habitats 
countries, sylvatic, peridomestic domestic behavior very
important vector chagas disease, especially peru. molecules produced and
secreted salivary glands fat body considered important adaptational
value triatomines because, among functions, subvert host
haemostatic, inflammatory immune systems detoxify protect against
environmental aggressors. context, elucidation molecules
produced tissues highly valuable understanding ability this
species adapt transmit pathogens. here, use high-throughput sequencing 
techniques assemble describe coding sequences resulting the
transcriptome fat body salivary glands p. lignarius. final
assembly transcriptomes together resulted total 11,507 coding
sequences (cds), mapped total 164,676,091 reads. cds
were subdivided according 10 folds overexpression salivary glands
(513 cds) fat body (2073 cds). among families proteins found the
salivary glands, lipocalins abundant. ubiquitous families 
proteins present sialomes also present p. lignarius, including
serine protease inhibitors, apyrase antigen-5. unique transcriptome of
fat body showed proteins related metabolic function organ.
remarkably, nearly 20% reads mapped transcripts coded triatoma
virus. data presented study improve understanding triatomines'
salivary glands fat body function reveal important molecules used 
interplay vectors vertebrate hosts.
