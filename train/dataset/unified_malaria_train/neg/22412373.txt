cerebral malaria major, life-threatening complication plasmodium
falciparum malaria, high mortality rate. murine malaria models,
natural killer (nk) cell responses shown play crucial role 
pathogenesis cerebral malaria. investigate role nk cells the
developmental process human cerebral malaria, conducted case-control
study examining genotypes killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir) and
their human leukocyte antigen (hla) class ligands 477 malaria patients. we
found combination kir2dl3 cognate hla-c1 ligand was
significantly associated development cerebral malaria compared
with non-cerebral malaria (odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.52-6.48,
p = 0.00079, corrected p = 0.02). contrast, kir-hla pairs showed a
significant association cerebral malaria, suggesting nk cell
repertoire shaped kir2dl3-hla-c1 interaction shows certain functional
responses facilitate development cerebral malaria. furthermore, the
frequency kir2dl3-hla-c1 combination found significantly lower
in malaria high-endemic populations. results suggest natural selection
has reduced frequency kir2dl3-hla-c1 combination malaria
high-endemic populations propensity interaction kir2dl3
and c1 favor development cerebral malaria. findings provide one
possible explanation kir-hla co-evolution driven microbial pathogen, and
its effect global distribution malaria, kir hla.
