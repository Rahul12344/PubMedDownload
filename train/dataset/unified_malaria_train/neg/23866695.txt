background: plasmodium falciparum repeatedly evolved resistance first-line
anti-malarial drugs, thwarting efforts control eliminate disease and
in period time contributed largely increase mortality. here
a mathematical model developed map spatiotemporal trends the
distribution mutations p. falciparum dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) 
gene confer resistance anti-malarial sulphadoxine, useful
marker combination alleles dhfr dhps highly correlated 
with resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp). aim study 
present proof concept spatiotemporal modelling trends in
anti-malarial drug resistance applied monitor trends resistance
to components artemisinin combination therapy (act) anti-malarials,
as emerge spread.
methods: prevalence measurements single nucleotide polymorphisms three
codon positions dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) gene published
studies dhps mutations across africa used. model-based geostatistics
approach adopted create predictive surfaces dhps540e mutation 
the spatial domain sub-saharan africa 1990-2010. statistical model
was implemented within bayesian framework hence quantified associated
uncertainty prediction prevalence dhps540e mutation in
sub-saharan africa.
conclusions: maps presented visualize changing prevalence dhps540e
mutation sub-saharan africa. allow prediction space-time trends in
the parasite resistance sp, provide probability distributions of
resistance prevalence places data available well insight on
the spread resistance way data alone allow. results
of work extended design optimal sampling strategies the
future molecular surveillance resistance, providing proof concept for
similar techniques design optimal strategies monitor resistance act.
