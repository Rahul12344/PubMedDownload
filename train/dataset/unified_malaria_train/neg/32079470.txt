the tight gene expression regulation controls development pathogenesis of
human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum throughout complex life cycle.
recent studies revealed pervasive nascent transcripts genome of
p. falciparum, suggesting existence hidden transcriptome involved the
dynamic gene expression. however, landscape related biological functions 
of nascent non-coding rnas (ns-ncrnas) still poorly explored. we
profiled transcription dynamics nascent rnas rrna-depleted stranded
rna sequencing course 48-h intraerythrocytic developmental cycle
(idc). identified genome-wide sources total 2252 ns-ncrnas, mostly
originating intergenic untranslated regions annotated genes. by
integrating nascent rna abundances atac-seq chip-seq analysis, we
uncovered euchromatic microenvironment surrounding ns-ncrna loci, and
revealed positive correlation ns-ncrnas corresponding mrna
abundances. finally, gene knock-down strategy, showed cooperation 
of rna exosome catalytic subunit pfdis3 pfmtr4 cofactor played major role
in ns-ncrnas degradation. collectively, study contributes understanding
of potential roles short-lived nascent ncrnas regulating gene
expression malaria parasites.
