background: anopheles gambiae, one main afro-tropical mosquito vector of
malaria, adapted heavy metals natural habitat, developed
resistance conventional insecticides. investigations conducted to
establish association tolerance cadmium lead-heavy metals, and
expression specific genes cytochrome p450 enzymes associated with
pyrethroid resistance mosquito.
methods: juvenile aquatic stages mosquito selected tolerance to
cadmiun lead chronic exposure stages maximum acceptable
toxicant concentrations (matcs) metals. using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qpcr), three replicates male female cadmium
or lead-tolerant individuals relevant controls separately screened for
expression cyp6m2, cyp6p3 cyp6z1 genes. variance expression levels 
of genes amongst treatments compared anova statistical tool.
results: expressions genes significantly lower (p <0.05) in
females males. within gender, 1.3 - 2.3 3.1-4.2-fold reduction
in expression genes cadmium lead selected respective control
populations. expression classes gene elevated cadmium
selected female populations relative respective controls.
conclusion: findings suggest tolerance cadmium lead the
mosquito influence response cytochrome p450 genes associated with
metabolism pyrethroids mosquito sex-specific manner. can, 
turn, affect sensitivity mosquito pyrethroids xenobiotics
associated genes, potential implications mosquito vector
control operations.
