background: plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (pfama-1) one of
leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. however, genetic variation and
antigenic diversity identified global pfama-1 major hurdles the
development effective vaccine based antigen. study, genetic
structure effect natural selection pfama-1 among myanmar p.
falciparum isolates analysed.
methods: blood samples collected 58 myanmar patients falciparum
malaria. full-length pfama-1 gene amplified polymerase chain reaction 
cloned ta cloning vector. pfama-1 sequence isolate sequenced. 
polymorphic characteristics effect natural selection analysed with
using dnastar, mega4, dnasp programs. polymorphic nature natural
selection 459 global pfama-1 also analysed.
results: thirty-seven different haplotypes pfama-1 identified 58
myanmar p. falciparum isolates. amino acid changes identified myanmar
pfama-1 found domains iii. overall patterns amino acid changes
in myanmar pfama-1 similar global pfama-1. however, frequencies 
of amino acid changes differed country. novel amino acid changes myanmar
pfama-1 also identified. evidences natural selection recombination
event observed global pfama-1. among 51 commonly identified amino acid
changes global pfama-1 sequences, 43 found predicted rbc-binding
sites, b-cell epitopes, iur regions.
conclusions: myanmar pfama-1 showed similar patterns nucleotide diversity 
amino acid polymorphisms compared global pfama-1. balancing natural
selection intragenic recombination across pfama-1 likely play major
roles generating genetic diversity global pfama-1. common amino acid
changes global pfama-1 located predicted b-cell epitopes high
levels nucleotide diversity balancing natural selection found. 
results highlight strong selective pressure host immunity pfama-1
gene. results significant implications understanding nature 
myanmar pfama-1 along global pfama-1. also provide useful information
for development effective malaria vaccine based antigen.
