secondray structure sequence its2-rdna egyptian malaria vector
anopheles pharoensis (theobald).

wassim nm.

out twelve anophelines present egypt, five species known be
malaria vectors. anopheles (an.) pharoensis proved important vector all
over egypt, especially delta. anopheles sergenti proved primary 
vector oases western desert, an. multicolor faiyoum, an.
stephensi red sea coast, an. superpictus sinai. genomic dna was
isolated single adult mosquito an. pharoensis (sahel sudanese form), pcr 
was performed amplify its2 region rdna using specific primers 5.8s 
28s rdna genes. amplicons purified, directly sequenced aligned to
the sequence region an. gambiae, using clustalw2. length of
its2-rdna an. pharoensis 411bp. gc content its2 reported 53% is
consistent spacer base composition anopheles species. similarity
between two species 52% genetic distance 0.46.variable simple
sequence repeats (ssrs) found low frequency. secondary structure of
rdna-its2was predicted mfold -192; 60 to-195.32 kilocalories/mole.
