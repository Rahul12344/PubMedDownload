due rapid, potent action young mature intraerythrocytic stages,
artemisinin derivatives central drug combination therapies plasmodium 
falciparum malaria. however, evidence emerging parasite
resistance/tolerance artemisinins southeast asia great concern. a
better understanding artemisinin-related drug activity resistance
mechanisms urgently needed. recent transcriptome study parasites exposed 
to artesunate led us identify series genes modified levels of
expression presence drug. gene presenting largest mrna
level increase, pf10_0026 (part), encoding hypothetical protein unknown
function, chosen study. immunodetection part-specific sera
showed artesunate induced dose-dependent increase protein level.
bioinformatic analysis showed part belongs plasmodium-specific gene
family characterized presence tryptophan-rich domain novel
hidden markov model (hmm) profile. gene disruption could achieved,
suggesting essential function. transgenic parasites overexpressing part
protein generated exhibited tolerance spike exposure high doses 
of artesunate, increased survival reduced growth retardation compared to
that wild-type-treated controls. data indicate involvement part
in parasite defense mechanisms artesunate. first report of
genetically manipulated parasites displaying stable reproducible decreased 
susceptibility artesunate, providing new possibilities investigate the
parasite response artemisinins.
