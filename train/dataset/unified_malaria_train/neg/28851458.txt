background: transmission drug-resistant parasites mosquito may be
influenced altered biological fitness drug-resistant parasites and
different immune reactions metabolic change mosquito. point,
little known variations mosquito immunity metabolism when
mosquitoes infected drug-resistant parasites. understand the
differential gene expression anopheles following infection drug-resistant
plasmodium, conducted genome-wide transcriptomic profiling analysis of
anopheles stephensi following feeding mice drug-resistant or
drug-sensitive p. yoelii, observed changes gene expression profiles and
identified transcripts affected drug-resistant parasite.
results: study impact drug-resistant plasmodium infections an.
stephensi gene transcription, analyzed three major transition stages of
plasmodium infections: 24 h 13 and 19 days blood-feeding. six cdna
libraries (r-as24h, r-as13d, r-as19d,s-as24h, s-as13dand s-as19d) were
constructed, rna sequencing subsequently performed. total,
approximately 50.1 million raw reads, 47.9 million clean reads 7.18g clean
bases obtained. following differentially expressed gene (deg) analysis, go
enrichment analysis degs, functional classification kegg, showed
that variations gene expression an. stephensi infected the
drug-resistant p. yoelii nsm occurred mainly at 13 days blood meal during
sporozoite migration hemolymph. differentially expressed genes
included functioning important immune reaction iron metabolism 
pathways, pattern recognition receptors, regulators jnk pathway,
components phagosome pathway, regulators melanization response,
activators complement reactions, insulin signaling cascade members, oxidative 
stress detoxification proteins.
conclusions: study shows drug-resistant p. yoelii nsm impact on
the transcript abundance levels an.stephensi mostly 13 days blood
meal sporozoite migration hemolymph most
differentially expressed genes downregulated. results highlight need
for better understanding selective pressures differentially
expressed genes drug-resistant plasmodium mosquito the
different transmission patterns drug-resistant plasmodium anopheles.
