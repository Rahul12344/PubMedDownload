pregnancy pharmacogenetics variation alter drug disposition treatment
outcome. objective study investigate effect pregnancy
and pharmacogenetics variation day 7 lumefantrine (lf) plasma concentration
and therapeutic responses malaria-infected women treated with
artemether-lumefantrine (alu) tanzania. total 277 (205 pregnant 72
nonpregnant) women uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria were
enrolled. patients treated alu followed 28 days. cyp3a4,
cyp3a5, abcb1 genotyping done. day 7 plasma lf concentration the
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) - corrected adequate clinical parasitological
response (acpr) day 28 determined. mean day 7 plasma lf
concentrations significantly lower pregnant women nonpregnant women 
[geometric mean ratio = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (ci) geometric mean
ratio (1.119-1.1745), p < 0.003]. pregnancy, low body weight, cyp3a5*1/*1
genotype significantly associated low day 7 lf plasma concentration (p 
< 0.01). pcr-corrected acpr 93% (95% ci = 89.4-96.6) pregnant women and
95.7% (95% ci = 90.7-100) nonpregnant women. patients lower day 7 lf
concentration high risk treatment failure (mean 652 vs. 232 ng/ml, p <
0.001). conclusion, pregnancy, low body weight, cyp3a5*1 allele are
significant predictors low day 7 lf plasma exposure. turn, lower day 7 lf
concentration associated higher risk recrudescence. significance
statement: study reports number factors contributing lower day 7
lumefantrine (lf) concentration women, includes pregnancy, body weight, 
and cyp3a5*1/*1 genotype. also shows day 7 lf concentration main
predictor malaria treatment. findings highlight need look into
artemether-lf dosage adjustment pregnant women able maintain
adequate drug concentration, required reduce treatment failure rates 
in pregnant women.
