the growth phenotype asexual blood stage malaria parasites influence their

parameters detail. developed new assay measure growth rates at
different starting parasitaemias 96-well format applied to
characterise growth plasmodium falciparum lines 3d7-a 3d7-b,
previously shown different invasion rates use different invasion
pathways. using simple accurate assay found 3d7-b more
sensitive high initial parasitaemia 3d7-a. result indicates that
different parasite lines show variation levels density-dependent
growth inhibition. also developed new assay compare duration the
asexual blood cycle different parasite lines. assay based the
tight synchronisation cultures 1 h parasite age window subsequent
monitoring schizont bursting formation new rings flow cytometry.
using assay observed differences duration asexual blood
cycle parasite lines 3d7 hb3. two new assays useful 
characterise variation growth-related parameters identify growth
phenotypes associated targeted deletion specific genes with
particular genomic, transcriptomic proteomic patterns. furthermore, the
identification density-dependent growth inhibition intrinsic parasite
property varies parasite lines expands repertoire measurable 
growth-related phenotypic traits potential influence outcome
of malarial blood infection.
