background: malaria still major public health problem world and
sub-saharan africa one affected areas. efforts control malaria 
are highly affected drug resistance commonly used antimalarials. the
introduction artemisinin based combination therapy (act) first line drug 
seems major step treatment uncomplicated malaria, though search for
drugs combine artemisinins still continues. reports on
increased prevalence wild type markers pfcrt 76k pfmdr1 86n some
african countries ideas using chloroquine (cq) intermittent presumptive
treatment adults (ipta) coming up. common combination artemether
and lumefantrine even selects parasites wild type these
positions. study comparing prevalence mutation two positions 
in two east african countries act first line drug following
somewhat different drug policies regarding cq. tanzania cq stopped 2001
but uganda cq retained combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) 
and used home based management fever time. sp still used ipt
for pregnant women.
methods: blood smears dried blood spots whatman filter papers were
collected 100 patients uncomplicated malaria mwanza, tanzania and
100 patients iganga, uganda. dna extracted samples using tris
edta method. pcr rflp performed sequencing done pfcrt
amplification products.
results: prevalence k76t mutations pfcrt samples mwanza,
tanzania 40.5% (34/84) 100% (100/100) samples iganga, uganda.
prevalence n86y mutations pfmdr1 16.9% (13/77) 77.7% (63/81) in
samples mwanza iganga, respectively. re-emergence cq sensitive
isolates mwanza, tanzania showed haplotype cvmnk typical wild type
isolates.
conclusions: prevalence cq resistant parasites mwanza, tanzania low 
compared existing high level resistant parasites iganga, uganda.
this could indication cq may become useful future tanzania. 
this study shows clearly difference mutations these
positions two countries implementing similar somewhat different drug
policies. uganda drug resistance reached fixation tanzania
the prevalence going down.
