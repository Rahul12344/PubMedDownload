parasites often reduced genomes genes become redundant when
utilizing host source metabolites, thus losing de novo
production metabolites. primate malaria parasites synthesize vitamin b1
(thiamine) de novo rodent malaria genome-sequenced apicomplexans
cannot, three essential genes responsible pathway absent in
their genomes. unique presence functional thiamine synthesis genes in
primate malaria parasites sequence similarities bacterial
orthologues, led speculations pathway horizontally acquired
from bacteria. show genes essential de novo synthesis of
thiamine found also avian plasmodium species. importantly, also
present species phylogenetically basal mammalian avian plasmodium
parasites, i.e. haemoproteus. furthermore, found genes are
expressed blood stage avian malaria infection, indicating 
this metabolic pathway actively transcribed. conclude ability to
synthesize thiamine widespread among haemosporidians, recent loss in
the rodent malaria species.
