fusion last two enzymes pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway the
inversed order cooh-terminal orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (oprt)
and nh2-terminal orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ompdc), as
ompdc-oprt, described many organisms. here, produced gene fusions of
plasmodium falciparum ompdc-oprt expressed bifunctional protein in
escherichia coli. enzyme purified homogeneity using affinity and
anion-exchange chromatography, exhibited enzymatic activities functioned a
dimer. activities, although unstable, stabilized substrate and
product purification long-term storage. furthermore, enzyme
expressed perfect catalytic efficiency (kcat/km). kcat selectively
enhanced three orders magnitude, km much affected 
remained low μm levels compared monofunctional enzymes. fusion
of two enzymes, creating "super-enzyme" perfect catalytic power and
more flexibility, reflects cryptic relationship enzymatic reactivities and
metabolic functions molecular evolution.
