malaria globally endemic tropical subtropical regions the
hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency. biological dogma hyper-endemic tribal land in
india leads high morbidity mortality. directed genetic abnormalities
of human erythrocytes found decrease susceptibility towards malaria
parasites heterozygotes abnormalities probably confer protection
against plasmodium falciparum infection. fascinating trend inverse
relationship sickle cell disorders g6pd deficiency scheduled caste
and tribal communities central-eastern india observed. the
frequency sickle cell allele decreases malaria endemic cross-section the
tribal population, frequency g6pd deficiency allele increases vice
versa. medical aspect important evolutionary biological
background could excellent point molecular analyses determine
the signature selection genomic regions Î²- globin g6pd genes.
since selection favors mutation least cost population [as the
clinical manifestations g6pd deficiency mild result a
complete loss enzyme activity sickle cell disease high
morbidity mortality region] predominant frequency g6pd
deficiency sickle cell disorders tribal communities, seems
that replacement sickle cell allele g6pd deficiency occurring in
the scheduled castes/tribes chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh, maharashtra and
odisha states central india. findings consistent previous
studies carried central-eastern india.
