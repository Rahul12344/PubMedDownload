protective immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria acquired natural
exposure largely antibody mediated. igg-specific p. falciparum emp1 (pfemp1)
proteins infected erythrocyte surface particularly important. the
transient antibody responses slowly acquired protective immunity probably
reflect clonal antigenic variation allelic polymorphism pfemp1.
however, likely immune-evasive mechanisms also involved,
such interference formation maintenance immunological memory. we
measured pfemp1-specific antibody levels enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) memory b-cell frequencies enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot
(elispot) assay cohort p. falciparum-exposed nonpregnant ghanaian women. 
the antigens used var2csa-type pfemp1 (it4var04) expression
restricted parasites infecting placenta, well two commonly
recognized pfemp1 proteins (hb3var06 it4var60) implicated rosetting and
not pregnancy restricted. enabled, first time, direct comparison
in individuals immune responses specific clinically important
parasite antigen expressed well-defined periods (pregnancy) to
responses specific comparable antigens expressed independent pregnancy.
our data indicate pfemp1-specific b-cell memory adequately acquired even 
when antigen exposure infrequent (e.g., var2csa-type pfemp1). furthermore,
immunological memory specific var2csa-type pfemp1 maintained many 
years without antigen reexposure circulating antigen-specific igg has
disappeared. study provides evidence natural exposure p. falciparum
leads formation durable b-cell immunity clinically important pfemp1
antigens. encouraging implications current efforts develop
pfemp1-based vaccines.
