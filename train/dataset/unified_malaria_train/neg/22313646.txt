objective: evaluate sensitivity specificity real time polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) detection malarial parasite.
study design: descriptive cross-sectional study.
place duration study: armed forces institute pathology (afip),
rawalpindi, april june 2010.
methodology: total 60 leishman stained blood films clinical suspicion
of malaria studied light microscopy detection malaria parasite
(mp). samples also subjected real time pcr small subunit
(ssu) rrna gene mp found four subspecies plasmodium. real time
pcr done taqman probe method. one sample positive mp serially 
diluted abo compatible blood, light microscopy real time pcr were
performed dilutions. results light microscopy real time pcr were
compared. sensitivity specificity calculated using pcr gold
standard.
results: pcr detected mp 33 samples sensitivity specificity 100%
whereas light microscopy could detect mp 30 samples. sensitivity and
specificity light microscopy 90.9% 100% respectively. serially 
diluted blood sample, mp visible 1/16 dilution whereas pcr showed
positive results even 1/512 dilution.
conclusion: real time pcr sensitive light microscopy the
detection malarial parasite.
