the global spread vector-borne diseases remains worrying public health
threat, raising need development new combat strategies vector
control. knowledge vector ecology exploited regard, including
plant feeding; critical resource mosquitoes sexes rely for
survival metabolic processes. however, identity plant species
mosquitoes feed nature remains largely unknown. testing hypothesis
about selectivity plant feeding, employed dna-based approach targeting
trnh-psba matk genes identified host plants field-collected
afro-tropical mosquito vectors dengue, rift valley fever malaria being
among important mosquito-borne diseases east africa. included
three plant species aedes aegypti (dengue), two aedes mcintoshi 
aedes ochraceus (rift valley fever) five anopheles gambiae (malaria).
since plant feeding mediated olfactory cues, sought identify 
specific odor signatures may modulate host plant location. using coupled gas
chromatography (gc)-electroantennographic detection, gc/mass spectrometry and
electroantennogram analyses, identified total 21 antennally-active
components variably detected ae. aegypti, ae. mcintoshi an. gambiae from
their respective host plants. whereas ae. aegypti predominantly detected
benzenoids, ae. mcintoshi detected mainly aldehydes an. gambiae detected
sesquiterpenes alkenes. interestingly, monoterpenes β-myrcene and
(e)-β-ocimene consistently detected mosquito species present 
in identified host plants, suggesting may serve signature
cues plant location. study highlights utility molecular approaches
in identifying specific vector-plant associations, exploited in
maximizing control strategies attractive toxic sugar bait and
odor-bait technology.
