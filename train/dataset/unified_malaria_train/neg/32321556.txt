background: olfactory cues drive mosquito behaviors host-seeking,
locating sugar sources oviposition. behaviors vary sexes
and closely related species. example, malaria vector anopheles coluzzii
is highly anthropophilic, whereas an. quadriannulatus not. behavioral
differences may reflected chemosensory gene expression.
methods: expression chemosensory genes antennae sexes of
an. coluzzii an. quadriannulatus compared using rna-seq. sex-biased
expression several genes an. coluzzii also compared using qpcr.
results: chemosensory expression mostly similar male antennae of
an. coluzzii an. quadriannulatus, modest differences in
expression. handful chemosensory genes male-biased species; 
highly expressed gustatory receptor aggr33, odorant binding proteins agobp25,
agobp26 possibly agobp10. although chemosensory gene repertoire mostly
shared sexes, several highly female-biased agors, agirs, one
agobp identified, including several whose expression biased towards the
anthropophilic an. coluzzii. additionally, expression several chemosensory
genes biased towards an. coluzzii sexes.
conclusions: chemosensory gene expression broadly similar species 
sexes, several sex- biased/specific genes identified. may modulate
sex- species-specific behaviors. although male behavior species 
remains poorly studied, identification sex- species-specific
chemosensory genes may provide fertile ground future work.
