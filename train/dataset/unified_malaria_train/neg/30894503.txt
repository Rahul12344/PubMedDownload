metabolic resistance insecticides pyrethroids mosquito vectors
threatens control malaria africa. unless managed, recent gains in
reducing malaria transmission could lost. improve monitoring assess the
impact insecticide resistance malaria control interventions, elucidated 
the molecular basis pyrethroid resistance major african malaria vector,
anopheles funestus showed single cytochrome p450 allele (cyp6p9a_r) 
a. funestus reduced efficacy insecticide-treated bednets preventing
transmission malaria southern africa. expression key insecticide
resistance genes detected populations mosquito vector throughout
africa varied according region. signatures selection adaptive
evolutionary traits including structural polymorphisms cis-regulatory
transcription factor binding sites detected evidence selection due
to scale-up insecticide-treated bednet use. cis-regulatory polymorphism 
driving overexpression major resistance gene cyp6p9a allowed us to
design dna-based assay cytochrome p450-mediated resistance pyrethroid
insecticides. using assay, tracked spread pyrethroid resistance
and found almost fixed mosquitoes southern africa was
absent mosquitoes collected elsewhere africa. furthermore, field study 
in experimental huts cameroon demonstrated mosquitoes carrying the
resistance cyp6p9a_r allele survived succeeded blood feeding often
than mosquitoes lacked allele. findings highlight need to
introduce new generation insecticide-treated bednets malaria control
that rely pyrethroid insecticides.
