lipids play key roles arthropod metabolism. ticks, biomolecules are
transported fat body organs, ovary gené's organ. gené's
organ, apparatus found exclusively female ticks, secretes protective wax 
coat onto egg surface, increasing egg viability environment due to
waterproof, cohesive, antimicrobial properties. work, combined
transcriptomic proteomic approach shows gené's organ solely secrets 
compounds taken hemolymph, actively engaged synthesis,
modification, oxidation lipids. gené's organ analyzed two distinct 
stages: 1) ticks detach host end hematophagous phase, 2) 
during egg-laying. data show gené's organ undergoes maturation process
before onset oviposition, preparation role egg-laying.
because deals wax-secreting organ, study focused lipid
metabolism, examining full machinery synthesize, modify, oxidize fatty
acids. proteins involved sterol modification, transport, degradation 
also addressed. addition highlighting gené's organ importance tick
reproductive physiology, results reveal proteins pathways crucial egg 
wax secretion, consequently, egg development environment. tools
targeting molecules pathways would impair egg viability the
environment, therefore potential developed novel tick
control methods.
