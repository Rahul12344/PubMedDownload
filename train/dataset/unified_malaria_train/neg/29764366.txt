background: genomes rearrangements carry valuable information phylogenetic
inference elucidation molecular mechanisms adaptation. however, 
detection genome rearrangements often hampered current deficiencies in
data methods: genomes obtained short sequence reads generally 
fragmented assemblies, comparing multiple gene orders generally leads to
computationally intractable algorithmic questions.
results: present computational method, adseq, which, combining ancestral 
gene order reconstruction, comparative scaffolding de novo scaffolding
methods, overcomes two caveats. adseq provides simultaneously improved
assemblies ancestral genomes, statistical supports local
features. compared previous comparative methods, runs polynomial time,
it samples solutions probabilistic space, handle significantly 
larger gene complement considered extant genomes, complex histories
including gene duplications losses. use adseq provide improved
assemblies genome history made duplications, losses, gene
translocations, rearrangements, 18 complete anopheles genomes, including
several important malaria vectors. also provide additional support a

these mosquito genomes.
conclusions: demonstrate method's ability improve extant assemblies
