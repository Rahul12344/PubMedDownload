background: sensitive methods detecting asymptomatic malaria infections are
essential identifying potential transmission reservoirs obtaining an
accurate assessment malaria epidemiology low-endemicity areas aiming to
eliminate malaria. pcr techniques detect parasite nucleic acids (dna rna)
are among commonly used molecular methods. however, these
methods low throughput cannot used large-scale molecular
epidemiological studies. recently developed capture ligation probe-pcr
(clip-pcr) claimed sensitivity molecular techniques the
high throughput capacity needed screening purposes. study aimed to
compare several molecular methods detecting asymptomatic submicroscopic
plasmodium infections healthy residents malaria-hypoendemic region in
southeast asia, malaria elimination sight.
method: study compared three molecular detection methods side-by-side,
namely nested pcr targeting rrna genes, nested rt-pcr detect parasite
rrna, clip-pcr detect parasite rrna 1005 healthy individuals in
northeastern myanmar. nested pcr rt-pcr, parasite dna total rna 
extracted from ~100 µl blood, whereas rna used clip-pcr 3 mm
disk dried blood filter paper. sensitivity specificity these
methods compared conventional light microscopy. addition,
rt-pcr quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) targeting pvs25 gene plasmodium
vivax used assess gametocyte prevalence samples.
results: light microscopy detected plasmodium infections 1.19% the
residents harbouring parasites. clip-pcr slightly better performance 
detected plasmodium infections 1.89% population. improvement
was achieved nested pcr detect parasite dna, detected p. vivax and
plasmodium falciparum infections 2.39% residents. nested rt-pcr
targeting rrna, however, detected many 187 (18.61%) individuals having
plasmodium infections p. vivax predominant species (176 p. vivax, 
5 p. falciparum 6 p. falciparum/p. vivax mixed infections). 210
plasmodium-positive samples detected molecular methods, 115 were
pvs25-positive qrt-pcr, indicating large proportion asymptomatic
individuals gametocyte carriers.
conclusion: nested rt-pcr based detection asexual-stage parasite rrna
was sensitive, sixfold higher sensitivity the
other two molecular methods parasite detection. clip-pcr increased
throughput, sensitivity study much lower 
molecular methods, may partially due smaller amount rna input 
used.
