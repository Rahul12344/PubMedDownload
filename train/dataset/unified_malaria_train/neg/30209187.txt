baculovirus (bv), enveloped insect virus circular dsdna genome,
possesses unique characteristics induce strong innate immune responses in
mammalian cells. study, show bv administration balb/c mice not
only provides complete protection subsequent plasmodium berghei
sporozoite infection 7 injection also eliminates
existing liver-stage parasites completely. elimination sporozoites bv
was superior primaquine, effect occurred a
tlr9-independent manner. 6 h bv administration, ifn-α ifn-γ were
robustly produced serum, rna transcripts ifn-stimulated genes 
markedly upregulated liver compared control mice. vivo passive
transfer serum bv administration effectively eliminated liver-stage
parasites, ifn-α neutralization abolished effect, indicating bv
liver-stage parasite-killing mechanism downstream type ifn signaling 
pathway. findings provide evidence bv-induced, fast-acting innate
immunity completely kills liver-stage parasites and, thus, may lead new
malaria drug vaccine strategies.
