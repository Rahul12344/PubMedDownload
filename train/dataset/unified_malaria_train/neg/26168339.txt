vaccines one greatest achievements mankind, saved millions
of lives last century. paradoxically, little known the
physiological mechanisms mediate immune responses vaccines perhaps due to
the overall success vaccination, reduced interest molecular
and physiological mechanisms vaccine immunity. however, several important
human pathogens including influenza virus still pose challenge vaccination,
and may benefit immune-based strategies. although influenza reverse genetics
has successfully applied generation live-attenuated influenza
vaccines (laivs), addition molecular tools vaccine preparations as
tracer components follow kinetics vaccination vivo, 
addressed. addition, recent generation mouse models allow specific
depletion leukocytes kinetic studies opened window opportunity
to understand basic immune mechanisms underlying vaccine-elicited protection.
here, describe combination reverse genetics chimeric mouse
models may help provide new insights vaccines work physiological
and molecular levels, using example recombinant, cold-adapted,
live-attenuated influenza vaccine (laiv). utilized laboratory-generated laivs 
harboring cell tracers well competitive bone marrow chimeras (bmcs) to
determine early kinetics vaccine immunity main physiological
mechanisms responsible initiation vaccine-specific adaptive immunity. 
in addition, show technique may facilitate gene function studies in
single animals immune responses vaccines. propose this
technique applied improve current prophylactic strategies against
pathogens urgent medical countermeasures needed, example
influenza, hiv, plasmodium, hemorrhagic fever viruses ebola virus.
