antimalarial drug resistance hampers effective malaria treatment. critical snps
in particular, putative amino acid transporter recently linked to
chloroquine (cq) resistance malaria parasites. here, show this
conserved protein (pf3d7_0629500 plasmodium falciparum; aat1 p. chabaudi)
is structural homologue yeast amino acid transporter tat2p, which
is known mediate quinine uptake toxicity. heterologous expression of
pf3d7_0629500 yeast produced cq hypersensitivity, coincident increased cq
uptake. pf3d7_0629500-expressing cultures also sensitized related
antimalarials; amodiaquine, mefloquine particularly quinine. drug sensitivity
was reversed introducing snp linked cq resistance parasite. like
tat2p, pf3d7_0629500-dependent quinine hypersensitivity suppressible with
tryptophan, consistent common transport mechanism. four-fold increase in
quinine uptake pf3d7_0629500 expressing cells abolished resistance 
snp. parasite protein localised primarily yeast plasma membrane. its
expression varied cells heterogeneity used show that
high-expressing cell subpopulations drug sensitive. results
reveal pf3d7_0629500 protein determine level sensitivity to
several major quinine-related antimalarials amino acid-inhibitable
drug transport function. potential clinical relevance discussed.
