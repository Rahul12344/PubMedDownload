background: obtaining informed consent participation genomic research in
low-income settings presents specific ethical issues requiring attention. these
include challenges arise providing information unfamiliar and
technical research methods, implications complicated infrastructure and
data sharing requirements, potential consequences future research with
samples data. study investigated researchers' participants' parents'
experiences consent process understandings genome-wide association 
study malaria involving children aged five mali. aimed to
inform best practices recruiting participants genomic research.
methods: qualitative rapid ethical assessment undertaken. fifty-five
semi-structured interviews conducted parents research
participants. additional nine semi-structured interviews conducted with
senior research scientists, research assistants member ethics
committee. focus group five parents research participants direct
observations four consent processes also conducted. french translated
english transcripts descriptively thematically coded using opencode
software.
results: participants' parents malariagen study differing
understandings causes malaria, rationale collecting blood
samples, purposes study kinds information study would
generate. genomic aspects research, including gene/environment
interaction underlying susceptibility resistance severe malaria, proved
particularly challenging explain understand.
conclusions: study identifies number areas addressed the
design consent processes genomic research, require careful
ethical analysis. include determining much information be
provided differing aspects research best promote
understandings genomic research. conclude important build
capacity design conduct effective appropriate consent processes
for genomic research low middle-income settings. additionally,
consideration given role review committees community
consultation activities protecting interests participants genomic
research.
