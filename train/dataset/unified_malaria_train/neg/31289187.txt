the survival plasmodium spp. within host red blood cell (rbc) depends on
the function membrane protein complex, termed plasmodium translocon of
exported proteins (ptex), exports certain parasite proteins, collectively
referred exportome, across parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (pvm) 
that encases parasite host rbc cytoplasm. core ptex consists of
three proteins: exp2, ptex150, hsp101 atpase; three proteins,
only exp2 membrane protein. studying ptex-dependent transport members
of exportome, discovered exported proteins, ring-infected
erythrocyte surface antigen (resa), failed transported parasites in
which parasite rhoptry protein ron3 conditionally disrupted.
ron3-deficient parasites also failed develop beyond ring stage, and
glucose uptake significantly decreased. findings provide evidence 
ron3 influences two translocation functions, namely, transport parasite
exportome ptex transport glucose rbc cytoplasm the
parasitophorous vacuolar (pv) space enter parasite via the
hexose transporter (ht) parasite plasma membrane.importance malarial
parasite within erythrocyte surrounded two membranes. plasmodium
translocon exported proteins (ptex) parasite vacuolar membrane
critically transports proteins parasite erythrocytic cytosol 
membrane create protein infrastructure important virulence. components
of ptex stored within dense granule, secreted parasite 
during invasion. describe protein, ron3, another invasion
organelle, rhoptry, also secreted invasion. find ron3 
is required protein transport function ptex glucose

mediated ptex component exp2.
