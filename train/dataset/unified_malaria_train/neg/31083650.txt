malaria parasites possess remarkable ability maintain chronic infections
that fail elicit protective immune response, characteristics have
stymied vaccine development cause people living endemic regions remain 
at risk malaria despite previous exposure disease. traits stem
from tremendous antigenic diversity displayed parasites circulating the
field. plasmodium falciparum, virulent human malaria
parasites, diversity exemplified variant gene family called var,
which encodes major surface antigen displayed infected red blood cells
(rbcs). gene family exhibits virtually limitless diversity var gene
repertoires different parasite isolates compared. previous studies
indicated remarkable genome plasticity results extensive ectopic
recombination var genes mitotic replication; however, the
molecular mechanisms direct process antigen-encoding loci 
rest genome remains relatively stable determined. using targeted 
dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) long-read whole-genome sequencing, show
that single break within antigen-encoding region genome result in
a cascade recombination events leading generation multiple chimeric 
var genes, process greatly accelerate generation diversity
within family. also found recombinations occur randomly, but
rather high-probability, specific recombination products observed
repeatedly. results provide molecular basis previously described
structured rearrangements drive diversification highly polymorphic
gene family.
