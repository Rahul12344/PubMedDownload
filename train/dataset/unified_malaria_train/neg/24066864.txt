background: increasing evidences role non-coding rna (ncrna) 
as key regulator cellular homeostasis. loc284889 uncharacterized ncrna
gene reverse strand mif mapped 22q11.23. mif, lymphokine, regulates
innate immune response up-regulating expression tlr4, suppressing the
p53 activity shown involved malaria pathogenesis.
methods: study, possible effect mif variations malaria
susceptibility investigated re-sequencing complete mif gene along with
1 kb 5' 3' region 425 individuals malaria endemic regions 
the orissa chhattisgarh states india. subjects comprised 160 cases 
of severe malaria, 101 mild malaria 164 ethnically matched asymptomatic
controls. data statistically compared cases controls their
possible association plasmodium falciparum malarial outcome.
results: first study, shows allele (rs34383331t > a)
in ncrna significantly associated increased risk p. falciparum malaria
[severe: = 2.08, p = 0.002 mild: = 2.09, p = 0.005]. addition, it
has observed higher mif-794catt repeats (>5) increases malaria risk
(or = 1.61, p = 0.01). further, diplotype (mif-794catt rs34383331t > a) 5 t
confers protection severe malaria (or = 0.55, p = 0.002) 6a (or = 3.07, 
p = 0.001) increases malaria risk.
conclusions: findings support involvement ncrna malarial
pathogenesis emphasize complex genetic regulation malaria
outcome. addition, study shows higher mif-794catt repeats (>5) is
a risk factor severe malaria. study would help identifying people 
are higher risk malaria adapt strategies prevention treatment.
