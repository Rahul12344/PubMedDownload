objectives: main objective study unravel distribution of
different pfcrt genotypes central, littoral, eastern southern regions 
of cameroon also locations bordering gabon equatorial guinea. 
because (i) chloroquine-resistant malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
shows wide occurrence cameroon, (ii) mutations 72nd 76th amino
acid positions pfcrt gene known confer resistance chloroquine,
and (iii) single chloroquine-resistant haplotype (c72v73i74e75t76) 
far reported cameroon.
methods: followed molecular approach dna sequencing second exon 
of pfcrt gene identify single nucleotide polymorphisms 180 p.
falciparum field isolates sampled five different locations cameroon.
results: chloroquine-resistant pfcrt cviet haplotype abundant,
followed wild-type cvmnk haplotype. five hitherto unreported
chloroquine-resistant pfcrt haplotypes detected first time in
cameroonian p. falciparum, including surprise appearance s(agt)vmnt
haplotype.
conclusions: high observed haplotype diversity chloroquine-resistant
pfcrt gene appearance s(agt)vmnt haplotype daunting be
attributed drug pressure and/or misuse chloroquine and/or amodiaquine
in cameroon.
