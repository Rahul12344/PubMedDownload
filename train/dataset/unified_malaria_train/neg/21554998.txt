elucidating genetic diversity duffy binding protein ii (pvdbpii), a
leading vaccine candidate vivax malaria, different geographical settings
is vital. sri lanka malaria transmission unstable low intensity. a
relatively high level allelic diversity, 27 polymorphic nucleotides and
33 (aa) haplotypes detected among pvdbpii gene 100 local plasmodium
vivax isolates collected two hypoendemic areas, non endemic area 
of country. mutations, recombination balancing selection seem maintain
the observed local allelic diversity pvdbpii. lack gene flow evidenced 
by high fst values two endemic study sites. aa
polymorphisms may alter binding expression capacity predicted cell
epitopes pvdbpii. 8 binding inhibitory linear b cell epitopes, 2 (h2
and m1) vicinity exact binding region pvdbpii appeared be
highly conserved sri lankan, iran colombian isolates, h3, m2, m3 and
l3 neutralizing epitopes seem polymorphic globally, h1 l2
conserved colombian, south korean iran isolates. comparison the
reference sal-1 strain, among 402 world-wide isolates (302 global 100 local),
121 aa polymorphisms 138 haplotypes recorded 3 aa polymorphisms
and 21 haplotypes seem unique sri lanka. pvdbpii phylogeny suggests that
local p. vivax parasites represent sample global population. the
ubiquitous presence pvdbpii aa haplotypes among local global p. 
vivax isolates may aid future vaccination strategies based pvdbpii.
