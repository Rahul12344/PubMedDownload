glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency one common
inherited enzymopathies endemic areas malaria including southeast asia. the
molecular features g6pd deficiency similar among southeast asian
population, differences type prominent variants each
region. study determined prevalence molecular characteristics of
g6pd deficiency northern thailand. quantitative assay g6pd activity was
conducted 566 neonatal cord blood samples 6 common g6pd mutations were
determined pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism method g6pd
complete intermediate deficiency samples. ninety newborns g6pd
deficiency, prevalence male newborns 17% female newborns
having intermediate complete deficiency 13% 2%, respectively. 
95 g6pd alleles tested, g6pd mahidol, g6pd kaiping, g6pd canton, g6pd viangchan, 
g6pd union, g6pd chinese-5 detected 19, 17, 15, 13, 7, 2 alleles, 
respectively. study shows prevalence g6pd deficiency northern 
thai population high combination common chinese mutations the
majority, distribution different central southern thailand g6pd 
viangchan prominent variant. findings suggest higher proportion of
assimilated chinese ethnic group northern thai population.
