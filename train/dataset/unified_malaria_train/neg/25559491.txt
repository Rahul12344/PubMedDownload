background: reduction number circulating blood lymphocytes
(lymphocytopaenia) reported clinical episodes malaria is
normalized treatment anti-malaria drugs. phenomenon well
established malaria infection, underlying mechanisms still fully
elucidated. present study, occurrence apoptosis pathways in
cd4+ cells investigated naturally plasmodium vivax-infected individuals 
from brazilian endemic area (porto velho - ro).
methods: blood samples collected p. vivax-infected individuals and
healthy donors. apoptosis characterized cell staining annexin
v/fitc propidium iodide apoptosis-associated gene expression profile 
was carried using rt2 profiler pcr array-human apoptosis. plasma tnf
level determined elisa. unpaired t-test mann-whitney test was
applied according data distribution.
results: plasmodium vivax-infected individuals present low number leukocytes
and lymphocytes higher percentage cd4+ cells early and/or late
apoptosis. increased gene expression observed tnfrsf1b bid,
associated reduction bcl-2, individuals p. vivax malaria.
furthermore, individuals showed increased plasma levels tnf compared 
malaria-naive donors.
conclusions: results present study suggest p. vivax infection
induces apoptosis cd4+ cells mediated two types signaling: by
activation tnfr1 death receptor (extrinsic pathway), amplified by
bid, decreased expression anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 (intrinsic
pathway). lymphocytes apoptosis could reflect strategy immune evasion 
triggered parasite, enabling persistence also limiting the
occurrence immunopathology.
