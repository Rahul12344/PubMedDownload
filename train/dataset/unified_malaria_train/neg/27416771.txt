background: mosquitoes host pass humans variety disease-causing
pathogens infectious viruses parasitic microorganisms. the
emergence spread insecticide resistance threatening effectiveness
of current control measures common mosquito vector borne diseases, as
malaria, dengue zika. therefore, emerging resistance widely used
pyrethroid insecticides alarming problem public health. herein we
demonstrated use rna interference (rnai) increase susceptibility of
adult mosquitoes widely used pyrethroid insecticide.
methods: experiments performed field-collected pyrethroid resistant
strain ae. aegypti (rio de janeiro; rj). larvae resistant ae. aegypti
population soaked double-stranded rnas (dsrnas) correspond either 
to voltage-gate sodium channel (vgsc), p-glycoprotein, p450 detoxification
genes reared adulthood. adult mortality rates presence various
deltamethrin pyrethroid concentrations used assess mosquito insecticide
susceptibility.
results: characterized rj ae. aegypti strain regard level of
resistance pyrethroid insecticide found approximately 6
times resistant deltamethrin compared laboratory rockefeller
strain. rj strain displayed higher frequency val1016ile phe1534cys
substitutions vgsc gene. resistant strain also displayed higher
basal expression level vgsc compared rockefeller strain. when
dsrna-treated mosquitoes subjected standard pyrethroid contact
bioassay, dsrna targeting vgsc increased adult mortality the
pyrethroid resistant strain. dsrna treatment proved effective increasing
adult mosquito susceptibility range pyrethroid concentrations these
results associated dsrna-specific small interfering rnas treated
adults, corresponding specific regulation vgsc gene expression
level. finally, demonstrated efficiency approach further
improved 'tiling' along vgsc gene order identify potent
dsrna sequences.
conclusions: results demonstrate dsrna applied mosquito larvae
retains biological activity adulthood. thus, rnai system reported
here could useful approach control widespread insecticide resistance 
in mosquitoes insect vectors human diseases.
