malaria represents major public health problem africa. east african
highlands, high-altitude areas previously considered cold support
vector population parasite transmission, rendering region particularly
prone epidemic malaria due lack protective immunity the
population. since 1980's, frequent malaria epidemics reported and
these successive outbreaks may generated immunity plasmodium
falciparum amongst highland residents. serological studies reveal indirect
evidence human exposure parasite, reliably assess prevalence of
exposure transmission intensity endemic area. however, vast
majority serological studies malaria been, hereto, limited small 
number parasite's antigens. surveyed compared antibody response
profiles age-stratified sera residents two endemic areas the
western kenyan highlands differing malaria transmission intensities, 
two distinct seasons, 854 polypeptides p. falciparum using
high-throughput proteomic microarray technology. identified 107 proteins as
serum antibody targets, characterized gene ontology
biological process cellular component parasite, showed significant
enrichment categories related immune evasion, pathogenesis expression 
on host's cell parasite's surface. additionally, calculated age-fitted
annual seroconversion rates immunogenic proteins, contrasted the
age-dependent antibody acquisition antigens two sampling
sites. observed highly immunogenic antigens produce stable antibody
responses early age sites, well less immunogenic proteins that
require repeated exposure stable responses develop produce different
seroconversion rates sites. propose combination highly and
less immunogenic proteins could used serological surveys detect
differences malaria transmission levels, distinguishing sites unstable 
stable transmission.
