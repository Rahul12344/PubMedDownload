introduction: due plasmodium resistance antimalarial drugs, important
to find new therapeutic alternatives malaria treatment control. based 
the knowledge colombian indigenous communities, collected extracts of
plants potential antimalarial effects middle vaupés region.
objective: evaluate mutagenic genotoxic effects, well gene
expression rad51c, xiap, p53 nrf2 induced four ethanolic extracts 
antimalarial activity (r001, t002, t015 t028).
materials methods: evaluated four ethanolic extracts antimalarial
activity using ames test assess mutagenicity, comet assay hepg2
cells determine genotoxicicity. also evaluated expression of
rad51c, xiap, p53 nrf2 hepg2 cells stimulated four extracts.
results: none four extracts mutagenic salmonella typhimurium ta98
strain presence absence s9 metabolic activity. extracts r001, t015 
and t028 weakly mutagenic ta100 strain presence s9, with
mutagenic indexes (mi) 1.58, 1.53 1.61, respectively. t015 strain
showed behavior without s9 mi 1.36. results comet 
assay showed four extracts produced category 1 2 damage, comets 
between 36.7 51.48 μm length. however, genetic damage index suggested 
that cells affected treatments. regarding gene
expression, extracts r001 t028 induced overexpression genes xiap and
p53 1.84 3.99 fold-change compared untreated cells.
conclusions: results revealed t002 extract safest it
had antimalarial activity cytotoxic hepg2 cells. moreover, 
not mutagenic produced category 1 damage dna. also, the
extract induce change expression tested genes.
