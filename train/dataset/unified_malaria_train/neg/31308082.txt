plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) important
malaria virulence factor. protein family divided clinically
relevant subfamilies. icam-1-binding group pfemp1 proteins also bind
endothelial protein c receptor associated cerebral malaria 
children. igg pfemp1 proteins acquired later life to
group pfemp1 binding icam-1. kinetics acquisition igg group b 
and c pfemp1 proteins binding icam-1 unclear studied here. gene
sequences encoding group b c pfemp1 dblβ domains known bind icam-1
were used identify additional binders. levels igg specific dblβ domains
from group a, b, c pfemp1 binding binding icam-1 measured in
plasma ghanaian children without malaria. seven new icam-1-binding
dblβ domains group b c pfemp1 identified. healthy children had
higher levels igg specific icam-1-binding dblβ domains group than
from groups b c. however, opposite pattern found children with
malaria, particularly among young patients. acquisition igg specific dblβ 
domains binding icam-1 differs pfemp1 groups.
