background: accurate laboratory diagnosis suspected malaria hallmark to
the control disease.
aim: clinical proficiency commercial rapid diagnostic test kits (rdts)
using nested pcr quality control evaluated among patients attending two
public healthcare providing institutions ilorin, kwara state, north-central,
nigeria.
method: cross-sectional evaluation finger prick blood samples volunteer
patients accessed malaria parasites pldh, hrp2, pf, pf/pan and
nested pcr molecular assays. data derived analysed using standard
formulae diagnostic accuracy, obtained predictive values were
subjected comparison one-way analysis variance (anova).
result: three hundred sixty-eight (368) patients comprising 203 (55%) females
and 165 (45%) males participated study. routine microscopy revealed 
54 (32.7%) males 80 (39.4%) infected plasmodium falciparum. sd
bioline (pldh) 47.4%; carestart malaria (hrp2) 49.8% recorded low sensitivities. 
micropoint (pfpan) 82.8% micropoint (mal. pf) 64.4% recorded high
sensitivity. sd bioline (pldh) 67.4%; carestart malaria (hrp2) 85.9%; micropoint 
(pfpan) 62.2% micropoint (mal. pf) 86.7% high specificities. positive
predictive value (ppv) ranged 67.7% 85.94%, negative predictive
values (npv) 64.4% sd bioline (pldh); 86.7% carestart malaria (hrp2); 
89.3% micropoint (pfpan) 58.5% micropoint (mal. pf). agarose gel
analysis p. falciparumssrrna gene (206 bp) 28 specimens containing 10%
concordant discordant samples showed 12 negative specimens rdts 
and routine microscopy truly negative npcr. however, remaining 16
specimens positive npcr showed discrepancies routine microscopy
and rdts. cohen's interrater diagnostic measure analysis revealed the
weighted kappa rdts moderate 0.417 (p=0.027), 95%ci (0.756, 0.078)
and good npcr 0.720 (p < 0.001), 95%ci (0.963, 0.477). area the
curve (auc) specify npcr effective rdts (npcrauc =
0.875; p < 0.001 rdtsauc = 0.708; p = 0.063).
conclusion: thorough large-scale quality control advocated commercial
rdts used sub-saharan african countries. avoid double
jeopardy consequent upon misdiagnosis unidentified positive cases serving as
pool reservoir insect vector cyclical infection re-infection of
the populace.
