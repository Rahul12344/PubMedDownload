natural resources recognized important sources potential drugs for
treating various infections, microorganisms rich natural source of
diverse compounds. among world's microorganisms, actinomycetes, are
abundant soil marine, well-known producers wide range of
bioactive secondary metabolites antibiotics. present study, four
actinomycetes (samples n25, n6, n18, n12) isolated soil samples 
mongolia. phylogenetic analysis isolates revealed share the
highest similarity streptomyces canus (n25), s. cirratus (n6), s. bacillaris
(n18) s. peucetius (n12), based 16s rrna gene sequencing. crude extracts
were obtained using ethyl acetate, crude fractions were
separated thin layer chromatography. fractions evaluated for
their cytotoxicities anti-toxoplasma antimalarial activities in
vitro. s. canus (n25) crude extract selected chemical
characterization based antiprotozoal activities. using liquid
chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid
(pca) detected identified active fractions metabolites from
strain n25. next confirmed commercially available pca possesses
antiprotozoal activity t. gondii (ic50: 55.5 μg/ml) plasmodium
falciparum (ic50: 6.4 μg/ml) vitro. results study reveal soil
actinomycetes potential sources antiprotozoal compounds, pca
merits investigation anti-protozoal agent.
