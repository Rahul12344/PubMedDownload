plasmodium falciparum, virulent malaria parasite species, causes severe 
symptoms especially acute lung injury (ali), characterized alveolar
epithelium endothelium destruction accelerated blood-gas-barrier
breakdown. parasitized erythrocytes, endothelial cells, monocytes, cytokines 
are involved mechanism, hemozoin (hz), parasitic waste from
heme detoxification, also mainly contributes. addition, clear why
type ii pneumocyte proliferation, alveolar restorative stage, rare in
malaria-associated ali. address this, vitro culture a549 cells with
plasmodium hz interleukin (il)-1β triggered hz monocytes
(hz-il-1β) conducted determine alveolar apoptotic effect using
ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining, annexin-v-fitc/propidium iodide
staining, electron mircroscopic study. caspase recruitment domain-containing 
protein 9 ( card9), apoptotic regulator gene, il-1β quantified by
reverse-transcriptase pcr. junctional cellular defects characterized by
immunohistochemical staining e-cadherin. results revealed cellular
apoptosis card9 expression levels extremely high 24 h induction by
hz-il-1β compared hz- non-treated groups. e-cadherin markedly
down-regulated hz-il-1β hz treatments. card9 expression positively
correlated il-1β expression number apoptotic cells.
interestingly, localization hz vesicular surfactant apoptotic
pneumocyte also identified submitted cause alveolar resolution
abnormality. thus, hz triggers monocytes produce il-1β induces pneumocyte 
type ii apoptosis card9 pathway association down-regulated
e-cadherin, probably impairs alveolar resolution malaria-associated ali.
impact statement present work shows physical immunomodulatory
properties hemozoin induction pneumocyte apoptosis relation to
il-1β production card9 pathway. occurrence may possible
pathway retardation lung resolution leading blood-gas-barrier
breakdown. findings lead understanding host-parasite
relationship focusing dysfunction ali induced hz, possible pathway
of recovering lung epithelial retardation malaria-associated ards.
