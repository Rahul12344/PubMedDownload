pf12 plasmodium falciparum characterized merozoite surface
protein pf12 gene actively transcribed schizont stage. an
orthologous gene, pv12, identified genome p. vivax, the
protein product characterized. pv12 362 amino acid long
polypeptide encoded single exon gene pvx_113775, orthologous genes
have identified plasmodium species bioinformatic approaches.
pv12 contains two predicted six-cysteine (6-cys) domains, may be
constrained predicted disulfide bonds, transmembrane domain a
predicted gpi anchor attachment site c-terminal region. recombinant pv12
protein recognized serum antibodies patients naturally exposed p.
vivax native pv12 protein parasite extract also recognized by
immune mouse serum. pv12 localized rhoptry; apical organelle 
merozoite, localization pattern pv12 distinct pf12 
p. falciparum. present study suggests pv12 immunogenic humans
during parasite infection could play important role erythrocyte
invasion.
