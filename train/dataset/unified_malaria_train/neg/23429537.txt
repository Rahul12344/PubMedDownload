apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) leading vaccine candidate, allelic 
polymorphism stumbling block vaccine development. previously showed
that global set ama1 haplotypes could grouped six genetic
populations. using information, six recombinant ama1 proteins representing
each population produced. rabbits immunized either single
recombinant ama1 protein mixtures recombinant ama1 proteins (mixtures 4,
5, 6 ama1 proteins). antibody levels measured enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa), purified igg rabbit used for
growth inhibition assay (gia) 12 different clones parasites (a total of
108 immunogen-parasite combinations). levels antibodies six ama1
proteins similar antibodies tested homologous
antigens. percent inhibitions gia plotted number 
elisa units measured homologous ama1, data points followed sigmoid
curve, regardless immunogen. homologous combinations, no
differences percent inhibition single-allele allele
mixture groups. however, allele mixture groups showed significantly higher
percent inhibition single-allele groups heterologous combinations.
the 5-allele-mixture group showed significantly higher inhibition heterologous
parasites 4-allele-mixture group. hand, no
difference 5- 6-allele-mixture groups. data indicate that
mixtures limited number alleles may cover majority parasite
population. addition, using data 72 immunogen-parasite combinations, 
we mathematically identified 13 amino acid polymorphic sites significantly 
impact gia activities. results could foundation rational
design future ama1 vaccine.
