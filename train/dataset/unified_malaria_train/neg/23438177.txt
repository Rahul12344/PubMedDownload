most tpss (terpene synthases) contain plasticity residues responsible
for diversified terpene products functional evolution, provide a
potential improving catalytic efficiency. artemisinin, sesquiterpene
lactone artemisia annua l., widely used malaria treatment and
progress made engineering production artemisinin its
precursors. present paper, report new sesquiterpene synthase a. 
annua, aabos (a. annua α-bisabolol synthase), high sequence identity
with aaads (a. annua amorpha-4,11-diene synthase), key enzyme artemisinin
biosynthesis. comparative analysis two enzymes domain-swapping and
structure-based mutagenesis led identification several plasticity
residues, whose alteration changed product profile aabos include
γ-humulene major product. elucidate underlying mechanisms, we
solved crystal structures aabos γ-humulene-producing aabos mutant
(termed aabos-m2). among plasticity residues, position 399, located the
substrate-binding pocket, crucial enzymes. aabos, substitution 
threonine leucine (aabosl339t) required γ-humulene production; whereas
in aaads, replacing threonine residue serine (aaadst399s) resulted 
substantial increase activity amorpha-4,11-diene production, probably
as result accelerated product release. present study demonstrates that
substitution plasticity residues potential improving catalytic
efficiency enzyme.
