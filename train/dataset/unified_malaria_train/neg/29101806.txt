tetrandrine known treatment tuberculosis, hyperglycemia,
negative ionotropic chronotropic effects myocardium, malaria, cancer and
fever since years together. known that, tetrandrine could modulate
multiple signaling molecules kinases cell cycle rat sarcoma (ras) 
pathway along proteins tumor suppressor genes, autophagy related,
β-catenins, caspases, death receptors. moreover, tetrandrine exhibited
reversal drug resistance modulating p-glyco protein (p-gp) expression
levels different cancers added advantage compound compared
to chemotherapy drugs. though, bioavailability tetrandrine limiting
factor, anticancer activity observed animal models without changing
any pharmacokinetic parameters. present review, role tetrandrine as
kinase inhibitor, inducer autophagy caspase pathways suppressor ras
mediated cell proliferation discussed along inhibition angiogenesis.
it also discussed tetrandrine potentiate anticancer effect in
different types cancers modulating multidrug resistance vitro 
in vivo trials including available literature clinical trials.
