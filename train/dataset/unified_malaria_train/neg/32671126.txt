background: today, use maggot therapy become widespread due the
increase chronic ulcers world. recombinant production secreted
enzymes larvae novel non-invasive method treatment of
chronic ulcers. lucilia sericata (l. sericata) collagenase (mmp-1) been
expressed insect cells. collagenase enzyme widely used in
clinical therapy industry. indicated collagenase is
expressed secreted salivary glands l. sericata using maggot
debridement therapy.
objectives: present study decided produce recombinant form of
collagenase enzyme spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) insect cells using the
baculovirus expression system (bac-to-bac).
materials methods: cloned coding sequences (residues 494-1705) l.
sericata collagenase pfastbachta donor plasmid. transposition
in bacmid dh10bac host, bacmid transfected sf9 cell line,
then expressed recombinant collagenase (mmp-1) purified using ni-nta 
agarose.
results: recombinant protein verified western blotting. furthermore,
the biological activity purified protein measured presence its
specific substrate inhibitor, 67 iu.ml-1 based results, 
it revealed characterized gene previous study codes l.
sericata collagenesa enzyme.
conclusion: considering broad applications collagenase medical
sciences, first time, cloned l. sericata collagenase (mmp-1) gene 
into insect cell line establish method expression and
purification l. sericata collagenase (mmp-1). result help preparing
and designing safe versatile recombinant drug future.
