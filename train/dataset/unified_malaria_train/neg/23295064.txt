populations plasmodium falciparum, virulent human malaria parasite,
are diverse owing wide levels transmission endemicity infection.
genetic diversity p. falciparum antigens, within parasite
populations, remains confounding factor malaria pathogenesis well as
clinical trials vaccine candidates. variation target antigens parasite
populations may arise immune pressure depending levels acquired
immunity. alternatively, similar study housekeeping genes [tanabe et
al. curr biol 2010;70:1-7], within-population genetic diversity vaccine
candidate antigens may also determined geographical distance a
postulated origin central sub-saharan africa. address question, we
obtained full-length sequences p. falciparum genes, apical membrane antigen 1 
(ama1) (n=459), circumsporozoite protein (csp) (n=472) merozoite surface
protein 1 (msp1) (n=389) seven geographically diverse parasite populations
in africa, southeast asia oceania; and, together previously determined
sequences (n=13 15 csp msp1, respectively) analyzed within-population
single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) diversity. three antigen genes showed
snp diversity supports model isolation-by-distance. standardized
number polymorphic sites per site, expressed θ(s), indicates 77-83%
can attributed geographic distance african origin, suggesting that
geographic distance plays significant role variation target vaccine
candidate antigens. furthermore, observed large proportion snps in
the antigen genes shared african non-african parasite
populations, demonstrating long term persistence snps. results
provide important implications developing effective malaria vaccines and
better understanding acquired immunity falciparum malaria.
