we recently characterized 24-hr daily rhythmic patterns gene expression in
anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. include numerous odorant binding proteins
(obps), soluble odorant carrying proteins enriched olfactory organs. we
demonstrate multiple rhythmically expressed genes including obps takeout
proteins, involved regulating blood feeding behavior, corresponding
rhythmic protein levels measured quantitative proteomics. includes
agamobp1, previously shown important an. gambiae odorant sensing. further, 
electrophysiological investigations demonstrate time-of-day specific differences 
in olfactory sensitivity antennae major host-derived odorants. the
pre-dusk/dusk peaks obps takeout gene expression correspond peak
protein abundance night, turn coincide time increased
olfactory sensitivity odorants requiring obps times increased
blood-feeding behavior. suggests important role obps modulating
temporal changes odorant sensitivity, enabling olfactory system to
coordinate circadian niche an. gambiae.
