host genetic factors frequently ascribed differential malaria outcomes 
a by-product evolutionary adaptation. respect, tumor necrosis factor
alpha (tnf-α), human cytokine, known associated malaria through
its differential regulation diverse malaria manifestations. since diversity in
differential malaria outcome uncommon every endemic settings, possible
association tnf-α malaria commonly established. order check
for association occurrence single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) 
in tnf-α gene different malaria manifestations, sequenced a
4011 bp region constituting promoter whole gene human tnf-α 61 
patients [(16 cerebral plus severe (scm), 21 severe (sm) 24 uncomplicated
(um)] samples highly malaria endemic state (odisha) india. multiple
sequence alignment revealed presence six snps (-1031 t > c, -863c > a,
-857c > t, -308g > a, -806c > t, +787c > a), -806c > t and
+787c > a novel malaria patients general +787c > a detected
for first time humans. although alleles due six different snps
segregate differentially three groups malaria (scm, sm um) the
present study, interestingly, -1031 t > c position, frequency of
individuals possessing homozygous rare allele higher scm group
with higher number heterozygotes um group. tajima's values
considering snps defined group positive statistically
insignificant conforming evolutionary constraint. however, statistically
significant deviation expectation hardy-weinberg equilibrium for
-1031 t > c snp um group points towards probable role natural
selection providing kind protection malaria odisha, india.
