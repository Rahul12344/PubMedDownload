background: initial comparative genomic study malaria vector anopheles 
gambiae yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti revealed striking differences
in genome assembly size abundance transposable elements between
the two species. however, chromosome arms homology an. gambiae and
ae. aegypti, well distribution genes repetitive elements in
chromosomes ae. aegypti, remained largely unexplored lack 
detailed physical genome map yellow fever mosquito.
results: using molecular landmark-guided fluorescent situ hybridization
approach, mapped 624 mb ae. aegypti genome mitotic chromosomes. we
used map analyze distribution genes, tandem repeats and
transposable elements along chromosomes explore patterns of
chromosome homology rearrangements ae. aegypti an. gambiae. the
study demonstrated q arm sex-determining chromosome 1 the
lowest gene content highest density minisatellites. comparative
genomic analysis an. gambiae determined previously proposed
whole-arm synteny fully preserved; number pericentric inversions have
occurred two species. sex-determining chromosome 1 higher
rate genome rearrangements observed autosomes 2 3 ae. aegypti.
conclusions: study developed physical map 45% ae. aegypti genome 
and provided new insights genomic composition evolution ae. aegypti
chromosomes. data suggest minisatellites rather transposable
elements played major role rapid evolution chromosome 1 aedes
lineage. research tools information generated study contribute to
a complete understanding genome organization evolution in
mosquitoes.
