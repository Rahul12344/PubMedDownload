anopheles farauti primary malaria vector throughout coastal regions of
the southwest pacific. shift peak biting time late early the
night occurred following widespread indoor residue spraying of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (ddt) persisted island
populations despite intervention ending decades ago. used mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase (coi) sequence data 12 newly developed microsatellite
markers assess population genetic structure malaria vector 
solomon archipelago. geographically distinct differences peak a. farauti 
night biting time observed solomon archipelago, tested hypothesis
that strong barriers gene flow exist region. significant often
large fixation index (fst) values found different island populations
for mitochondrial nuclear markers, suggesting highly restricted gene flow
between islands. discordance location strength genetic breaks 
was observed mitochondrial microsatellite markers. since early
night biting a. farauti individuals occur naturally populations, the
strong gene flow barriers identified solomon archipelago lend
weight hypothesis shifts peak biting time late early
night appeared independently disconnected island populations. for
this reason, suggest insecticide impregnated bed nets indoor residue 
spraying unlikely effective control tools a. farauti
occurring elsewhere, used, probably result peak biting time
behavioural shifts similar observed solomon islands.
