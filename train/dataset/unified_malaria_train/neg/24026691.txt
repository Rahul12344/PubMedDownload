for effective control pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes, precise surveillance
data mosquito distribution essential. recently, increase insecticide
resistance due kdr mutation anopheles gambiae, mosquito that
transmits malaria parasite, reported. aim developing a
simple effective method surveying resistant mosquitoes, lamp applied 
to allele-specific detection kdr gene an. gambiae. allele-specific 
lamp (as-lamp) method successfully distinguished kdr homozygote the
heterozygote wild type. robustness as-lamp suggests usefulness
for routine identification insects, mosquitoes also vectors
and agricultural pests. describe method as-lamp detect mutation
in anopheles mosquitoes.
