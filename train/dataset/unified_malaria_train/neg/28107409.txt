site-2 proteases (s2p) belong m50 family metalloproteases, which
typically perform essential roles mediating activation membrane-bound
transcription factors regulated intramembrane proteolysis (rip).
protease-dependent liberation dormant transcription factors triggers diverse
cellular responses, sterol regulation, notch signalling unfolded 
protein response. plasmodium parasites rely regulated proteolysis for
controlling essential pathways throughout life cycle. study we
examine plasmodium-encoded s2p murine malaria model show 
expressed stages plasmodium development. localisation studies by
endogenous gene tagging revealed invasive stages protein in
close proximity nucleus. ablation pbs2p reverse genetics leads to
reduced growth rates liver blood infection and, hence, virulence
attenuation. strikingly, absence pbs2p compatible parasite life cycle
progression mosquito mammalian hosts physiological conditions,
suggesting redundant dispensable roles vivo.
