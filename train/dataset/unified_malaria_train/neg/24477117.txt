the immune evasion gene family malaria parasites encodes variant surface
proteins expressed surface infected erythrocytes help 
parasite evading host immune response means antigenic variation. the
identification plasmodium vivax vir orthologous immune evasion gene family
from primate malaria parasites would provide new insight evolution of
virulence pathogenesis. three vir subfamilies viz. vir-b, vir-d vir-g
were successfully pcr amplified primate malaria parasites, cloned and
sequenced. dna sequence analysis confirmed orthologues vir-d subfamily in
plasmodium cynomolgi, plasmodium simium, plasmodium simiovale plasmodium
fieldi. identified vir-d orthologues 1-9 distinct members immune
evasion gene family 68-83% sequence identity vir-d 71.2-98.5%
sequence identity within members identified primate malaria parasites.
the absence vir subfamilies among primate malaria parasites reflects the
limitations experimental approach. study clearly identified the
presence vir-d like sequences four species plasmodium infecting primates
that would useful understanding evolution virulence malaria
parasites.
