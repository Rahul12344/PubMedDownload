the positive selection nucleotide substitution exon 2 plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene (mutation responsible 
for chloroquine resistance) causes reduction variation neutral loci close
to gene. reduction allelic diversity around flanking regions pfcrt
gene reported worldwide chloroquine resistant isolates referred as
selective sweep. plasmodium falciparum isolates india, selective sweep 
in flanking loci pfcrt gene well established, however, high allelic
diversity observed intragenic microsatellites pfcrt gene implied ongoing
genetic recombination. understand, molecular evolution of
chloroquine-resistant p. falciparum isolates india follow selective sweep
model, analyzed genetic diversity seven intragenic seven flanking 
microsatellites pfcrt (-24 +106kb) gene chloroquine sensitive and
resistant parasites originating high low transmission areas. observed
low expected heterozygosity loci resistant pfcrt-haplotypes (he=0-0.77)
compared wild-type (he=0.38-0.96). resistant svmnt high transmission 
areas showed significantly higher mean (p=0.03, t-test) intragenic and
pfcrt-flanking loci (-24 +22 kb) comparison low transmission areas. 
observation reduction variation intragenic flanking loci of
mutant pfcrt gene confirmed selective sweep model natural selection in
chloroquine resistant p. falciparum isolates india.
