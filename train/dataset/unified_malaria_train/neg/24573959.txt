objectives: aims work provide first data novel strs 
nos gene regions human populations test possible correlations 
mortality rate malaria different areas sardinia (italy).
methods: present study, 16 strs (13 analyzed first time human
populations) localized three genes nos typed 213 healthy individuals, 
unrelated least three generations, six historical-geographical
sardinian areas. strs alleles determined sequencing. statistical
analyses performed genepop (v.4.0), arlequin (v.3.5.1.2), r (v.2.15.1),
statistica (v.5.1), phase (v.2.1) software packages.
results: number alleles found locus ranged 2 12 their
distribution often unimodal. populations met hardy weinberg
equilibrium bonferroni correction, exceptions. analysis genetic
distances show strong genetic structuring investigated
populations. instead, population genetic variability shows positive and
highly significant (p-value < 0.01) correlation mortality determined by
malaria infection alleles (tgga)7 nos2, (aaaag)2 (attt)10 adnos1,
and (aaaca)11 adnos3 genes.
conclusions: peculiar allele distribution found several nos alleles could
be due malaria infection may contributed frequencies, but
we cannot exclude peculiar allele distribution nos might also due 
to genetic drift, emphasized isolation founder effect.
