although known malaria parasites proliferate midgut mosquito
vector, detailed behaviors, gamete maturation formation next
generation sporozoite, fully understood cellular molecular
level. mainly attributed technical difficulties dissection and
whole-mount observation, delicate opaque mosquito body contents. in
addition, blood pigment surrounding parasites immediately blood meal also
complicates tracing mosquito-stage parasites. recent revolutionary studies have
overcome negative factors tissue observation clearing organisms. cubic
reagents succeeded remove light scattering blood pigment various
mouse tissues, whole-organ image fluorescence-labeled cell structures. 
this study, utilized advanced version cubic technology high
sensitivity fluorescent markers see-through observation mosquito vector
after engulfment rodent malaria parasites clarify behaviors during
mosquito stage. result, succeeded visualize oocysts, sporozoites,
female gametes ookinetes mosquito bodies without dissection.
