background: although numbers malaria cases china declining in
recent years, outbreaks plasmodium vivax malaria still reported 
rural areas south yellow river. better understand transmission
dynamics p. vivax parasites china, extent genetic diversity p.
vivax populations circulating bozhou anhui province china were
investigated using three polymorphic genetic markers: merozoite surface proteins 
1 3α (pvmsp-1 pvmsp-3α) circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).
methods: forty-five p. vivax clinical isolates bouzhou anhui province
were collected 2009 2010 analysed using pcr/rflp dna
sequencing.
results: seven six distinct allelic variants identified using pcr/rflp
analysis pvmsp-3α hhai alui, respectively. dna sequence analysis of
pvmsp-1 (variable block 5) revealed sal-i recombinant types
but belem type, seven distinct allelic variants pvmsp-1 detected,
with recombinant subtype 2 (r2) predominant (66.7%). isolates
carried pvcsp vk210 type vk247 p. vivax-like types the
samples. sequence analysis pvcsp gene revealed 12 distinct allelic variants,
with vk210-1 predominant (41.5%).
conclusions: present data indicate degree genetic
diversity among p. vivax populations anhui province china. genetic data
obtained may assist surveillance p. vivax infection endemic areas or
in tracking potential future disease outbreak.
