mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) regulate key signaling events in
eukaryotic cells. genomes protozoan plasmodium parasites, causative
agents malaria, two genes encoding kinases significant homology 
eukaryotic mapks identified (mapk1, mapk2). work, show 
both genes transcribed plasmodium berghei liver stage development, and
analyze expression subcellular localization pbmapk1 protein liver
stage parasites. live cell imaging transgenic parasites expressing gfp-tagged 
pbmapk1 revealed nuclear localization pbmapk1 early schizont stage
mediated nuclear localization signals c-terminal domain. contrast, a
distinct localization pbmapk1 comma/ring-shaped structures proximity 
the parasite's nuclei invaginating parasite membrane observed 
the cytomere stage parasite development well immature blood stage
schizonts. pbmapk1 localization found independent integrity a
motif putatively involved atp binding, integrity putative activation
motif presence predicted coiled-coil domain c-terminal
domain. although pbmapk1 knock parasites showed normal liver stage
development, kinase may still fulfill dual function schizogony 
merogony liver stage parasites regulated dynamic stage-dependent
subcellular localization.
