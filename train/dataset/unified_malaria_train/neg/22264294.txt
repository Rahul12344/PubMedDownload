background: anti-malarial drug resistance poses threat current global
efforts towards control elimination malaria. several methods used in
monitoring anti-malarial drug resistance. molecular markers single
nucleotide polymorphism (snp) example increasingly used identify
genetic mutations related anti-malarial drug resistance. several methods are
currently used analysis snp associated anti-malarial drug
resistance although one methods unique strengths and
shortcoming, still need improve and/or develop new methods 
close gap found current methods.
methods: taqman allelic discrimination assays detection snps associated
with anti-malarial drug resistance designed analysis applied
biosystems pcr platform. assays designed submitting snp sequences
associated anti-malarial drug resistance applied biosystems website.
eleven snps associated resistance anti-malarial drugs selected and
tested. performance snp assay tested creating plasmid dnas
carrying codons interests analysing analysis. test the
sensitivity specificity snp assay, 12 clinical samples sequenced
at codons interest used analysis. plasmid dnas used to
establish limit detection (lod) assay.
results: data genetic profiles plasmodium falciparum laboratory
strains sequence data 12 clinical samples used reference
method performance snp assays compared to. the
sensitivity specificity snp assay establish 100%. lod each
assay established 2 ge, equivalent less 1 parasite/Î¼l. snp assays 
performed well detecting mixed infection analysis clinical samples.
conclusion: taqman allelic discrimination assay provides good alternative tool 
in detection snps associated anti-malarial drug.
