the severity plasmodium falciparum malaria associated parasite
cytoadherence, limited knowledge effect parasite
cytoadherence malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).
our objective evaluate cytoadherence infected red blood cells
(irbcs) murine model ards appraise potential function of
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) ards pathogenesis. dba/2 mice infected
with p. berghei anka classified ards- hyperparasitemia- (hp-)
developing mice according respiratory parameters parasitemia. lungs,
blood, bronchoalveolar lavage collected gene expression protein
analyses. primary cultures microvascular lung endothelial cells dba/2
mice analyzed irbc interactions. lungs ards-developing mice showed 
evidence irbc accumulation along increase epcr tnf
concentrations. furthermore, tnf increased irbc adherence vitro.
dexamethasone-treated infected mice showed low levels tnf epcr mrna
expression and, finally, decreased vascular permeability, thus protecting mice
from ards. conclusion, identified increased irbc cytoadherence 
lungs underlies malaria-associated ards dba/2-infected mice that
inflammation increased cytoadherence capacity, suggesting participation epcr
and conceivable target drug development.
