anti-malaria interventions rely insecticides compromised by
insecticide-resistance alleles among malaria vectors. examined frequency
changes resistance alleles two loci, knockdown resistance (kdr) and
acetylcholinesterase-1 (ace-1), confer resistance pyrethroids ddt,
and carbamates, respectively. total 7,059 anopheles gambiae sensu stricto
mosquitoes analyzed multiple sites across continental equatorial
guinea. subset sites included samples collected pre-intervention (2007) 
post-intervention (2009-2011). l1014s l1014f resistance alleles were
observed almost pre-intervention collections. particular, l1014f was
already substantial frequencies form populations (17.6-74.6%), at
high frequencies (> 50%) two form populations. comparison and
throughout anti-vector interventions showed drastic increases l1014f,
presumably caused intensified selection pressure imposed pyrethroids used
in vector control efforts. light findings, inclusion other
insecticide classes anti-vector intervention considered prudent.
