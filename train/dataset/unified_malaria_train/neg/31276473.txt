in epidemiological surveys surveillance application molecular tools is
essential detecting submicroscopic malaria. genus-specific conventional
cytochrome b (cytb) pcr shown high sensitivity field studies, detecting
70% submicroscopic malaria. main objective study assess the
conversion conventional real-time pcr testing sybr probe
protocols, including quantitative (q) pcr. protocols assessed
applying well-defined clinical patient material consisting 33 positive 80 
negative samples. sequencing positive pcr products performed. addition,
a sensitivity comparison real-time pcr methods done including five
relevant assays investigating effect amplification target platform.
sensitivity examined using field material consisting 111
p.falciparum positive samples tanzanian children (< 5 years), well as
using related patient data assess application q-pcr focus on
low-level parasitaemia. cytb sybr probe pcr protocols showed high
sensitivity specificity conventional counterpart, except missing one
p. malariae sample. sybr protocol sensitive specific using 
probe. overall, choice amplification target applied relevant achieving 
ultra-sensitivity, using intercalating fluorescence dye rather labelled 
hydrolysis probes favourable. application q-pcr analysis field projects 
is important awareness understanding low-level parasitaemia. for
use clinical diagnosis epidemiological studies highly sensitive and
user-friendly cytb sybr q-pcr method relevant tool. genus-specific
method advantage species identification sequencing be
performed alternative species-specific pcr.
