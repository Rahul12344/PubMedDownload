ruvbls constitute conserved group atpase proteins play significant role
in variety cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell
cycle dna damage repair. three ruvbl homologues, namely, pfruvbl1, pfruvbl2
and pfruvbl3 identified p. falciparum, unlike eukaryotic
counterparts, two ruvbl proteins (ruvbl1 & ruvbl2). present study 
expands understanding pfruvbl3 protein thereby basic biology of
plasmodium general. here, shown parasite pfruvbl3 true
homolog human/yeast ruvbl2 protein. result show pfruvbl3
constitutively expresses throughout stages intra-erythrocytic cycle (idc) 
with varied localization. addition atpase oligomerization activity, 
have first time shown pfruvbl3 possess dna cleavage activity which
interestingly dependent insertion domain. furthermore, also
identified ruvbl3 interacting partner essential chromatin
remodeling protein pfmyst together colocalize h3k9me1 histone in
parasitophorous vacuole ring stage idc suggesting potential
involvement chromatin remodeling gene transcription.
