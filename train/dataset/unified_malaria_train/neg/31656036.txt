macroautophagy (hereafter referred autophagy) highly conserved,
intracellular degradation process characterised de novo formation of
autophagosomes. double membraned organelles engulf deliver cargo, for
example damaged organelles protein aggregates, lysosomes degradation
and recycling. autophagy primarily stress response mechanism activated to
survive unfavourable conditions starvation hypoxia. addition,
autophagy functions differentiation, immune responses invading
microorganisms tissue remodelling mammalian cells. besides its
cytoprotective nature, depending context, autophagy well
support cell death. based autophagy&rsquo;s cytoprotective, cytotoxic and
developmental influences, come surprise mechanism is
involved tumourigenesis, tumour development response anticancer
therapies. her2 receptor tyrosine kinase activates downstream
signalling pathways involved cellular survival, growth proliferation.
amplification gene subsequent overexpression her2 protein lead 
to increased activation downstream signalling implicated several
cancer types. her2-targeted therapies valuable treatment options her2
amplified cancers. however, pre-existing acquired resistance remain a
clinical challenge. autophagy discussed several scenarios her2
amplified cancers. generally, her2+ tumours shown exhibit low levels
of proteins essential autophagy. moreover, protein involved autophagy
activation, beclin-1, shown interact directly her2 cellular
membrane. signalling cascade activated her2 also activates mtor, a
negative regulator autophagy. context resistance formation against
her2-targeting treatment, autophagy often reported upregulated,
and resistance shown abrogated autophagy inhibition. since
the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine hydroxychloroquine approved drugs
for treatment malaria, autophagy inhibition discussed option to
enhance effect certain anticancer treatments overcome resistance
against cancer therapies. review focus autophagy role in
