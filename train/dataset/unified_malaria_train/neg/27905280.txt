objective: malaria important tropical disease detected 198
million people causes 367-755 thousand deaths annually. recently, the
real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique enabled quick
determination plasmodium spp. species identification assay
with low contamination risk. present study, aimed use real-time
pcr targeting 18s rrna gene diagnose plasmodium spp. perform species
identification.
methods: dna samples 15 patients malaria (14 caused p. vivax, 1 caused
by p. falciparum) confirmed microscopy well positive control plasmids
were used. negative control, dna samples 15 individuals without malaria
were used.
results: according results real-time pcr, samples 15 patients with
malaria found positive plasmodium spp. melting curve analysis
showed 14 p. vivax remaining p. falciparum. in
addition, mixed infection p. falciparum p. vivax successfully
detected real-time pcr dna p. falciparum- p. vivax-positive
samples experimentally mixed.
conclusion: present study showed real-time pcr useful the
diagnosis species identification plasmodium spp. well detection 
of mixed infections addition microscopy turkey.
