background: failed diagnoses falciparum malaria cases rdts are
constantly reported recent years. plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein
2 (pfhpr2) gene deficiency found major reason rdts failure 
in many countries. article analysed deletion pfhpr2 gene of
falciparum malaria cases isolated yunnan province, china.
methods: blood samples falciparum malaria cases diagnosed yunnan province
were collected. plasmodium genomic dna extracted pfhrp2 gene exon2
region amplified via nested pcr. haplotype dna sequence, the
nucleic acid diversity index (pi) expected heterozygosity (he) analyzed.
count pfhrp2 amino acid peptide sequence repeat times, predict the
properties pfhrp2 peptide chain reaction rdts testing.
results: total 306 blood samples collected, 84.9% (259/306) 
pfhrp2 pcr amplification products (gene exon2) obtained, remaining
47 samples false amplification. length 250 dna sequences ranged
from 345 - 927Â bp, 151 haplotypes, pi values 0.169 0.983,
respectively. length pfhrp2 peptide chain translated 250 dna
sequences ranged 115 309 aa. peptide chains amino
acid codon deletion. 250 pfhrp2 strands ended type 12 amino acid
repeat, 98.0% (245/250) started type 1 repetition 2.0% (5/250) 
type 2 repetition. detection rate type 2 duplicates 100% (250/250).
prediction rdt sensitivity pfhrp2 peptide chains based type 2 type 7
repeats showed 9.60% (24/250), 50.0% (125/250), 13.20% (33/250) 27.20.5%
(68/250) 250 peptide chains sensitive, sensitive, borderline and
non-sensitive, respectively.
conclusion: diversified polymorphism pfhrp2 gene deletion from
different infection sources yunnan province extremely complex. the
cause failure pfhrp2 exon2 amplification still investigated.
the results study appeal yunnan province timely evaluation of
the effectiveness applicability rdts diagnosis malaria.
