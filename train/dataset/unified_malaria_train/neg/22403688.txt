background: heavy metal lead shown associated genotoxic
risk. drosophila melanogaster model organism commonly utilized genetic
toxicology testing. endosymbionts--wolbachia common wild
populations laboratory stocks drosophila. wolbachia may induce resistance 
to pathogenic viruses, filarial nematodes plasmodium fruit fly and
mosquito hosts. however effect wolbachia infection resistance of
their hosts heavy metal unknown.
methodology/principal findings: manipulating lead content diet of
drosophila melanogaster, found lead consumption different effects 
on developmental time wolbachia-infected (dmel wmel) -uninfected
(dmel t) flies. pb-contaminated medium, significantly reduced amount 
pupae adults dmel wmel emerged, dmel wmel adults had
significantly shorter longevity dmel flies. lead infusion diet 
resulted significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (sod) activity dmel t
flies (p<0.05), dmel wmel flies. correspondingly, lead cultures
induced 10.8 fold increase malonaldehyde (mda) contents dmel larvae
(p<0.05). dmel wmel larvae, resulted 1.3 fold increase. 
quantitative rt-pcr, showed lead infused medium caused significantly
increased expression level relish ceca2 genes dmel flies (p<0.01).
lead cultures change dramatically expression genes dmel
wmel flies.
conclusions/significance: results suggest wolbachia infection
decreased resistance drosophila lead likely limiting production 
of peroxides resulted lead, thus unable activate immunological 
pathway host prevent lead damage. represents novel
wolbachia-host interaction provides information researchers working on
drosophila toxicology take consideration presence wolbachia in
the stocks analyzing.
