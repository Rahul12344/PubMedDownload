plasmepsin v plasmodium falciparum (pfpmv) responsible cleavage
of plasmodium export element (pexel) motif n-terminus several
hundreds exported proteins. pfpmv necessary parasite viability 
has become novel promising target antimalarial therapy. first
recombinant expression soluble, active pfpmv thioredoxin fusion proteins is
reported herein. two truncated forms pfpmv fused thioredoxin (trx) 
generate trx-pfpmvp37 trx-pfpmvm84. fusion proteins successfully
purified using ni(2+) affinity chromatography combination atp treatment
to eliminate escherichia coli hsp60 contaminant. trx-pfpmvm84 could hydrolyze the
pexel-containing peptides efficiently trx-pfpmvp37. interestingly, both
trx-pfpmvs preferred cleave pfemp2 peptide hrpii peptide. replacement
of ser val glu p1' position created substrate 75% reduction 
the enzyme activity, whereas substitution ile lys glu p2
position reduced cleavage efficiency 30%. activity trx-pfpmvm84 was
inhibited pmsf nelfinavir pepstatin a. removal trx
domain, activities enzymes toward pfemp2 hrpii peptides fitted
to michaelis-menten model determine kinetic parameters. km values
toward peptides apparently much lower previously reported data
although similar kcat values. along improved pfpmv preparation
protocol, findings provided insights substrate specificity at
p2 p1' positions well interactions among enzyme, substrates, and
inhibitors.
