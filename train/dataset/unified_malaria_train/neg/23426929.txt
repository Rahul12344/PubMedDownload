asymptomatic infection plasmodium falciparum important obstacle to
eliminating malaria. asymptomatic carriers seek treatment infection,
and therefore become reservoir parasite. reason, these
carriers pose real public health risk. systematic identification and
treatment asymptomatic infections reduce parasite reservoir. a
large reduction pool lower chance transmission the
disease. study, screened tribal population 1,040 individuals in
the purulia district west bengal using dual-antigen rapid diagnostic kit 
(rdk), microscopy, species-specific pcr. positive individuals were
treated artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) (artesunate plus
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) followed 42 days. polymorphisms candidate
genes screened dna sequencing. significant proportion (8.4%) the
study population infected p. falciparum showed clinical
manifestations. pcr method sensitive detecting infection the
rdk microscopy. efficacy act 97%. pfcrt gene, the
mutation k76t (the mutated amino acid indicated bold type) found in
100% cases. pfmdr1 gene, mutations n86y y184f noted in
55.5% 11% cases, respectively. six different haplotypes were
identified pfdhfr-pfdhps genes. importantly, quintuple mutant
a(16)i(51)r(59)n(108)i(164)-s(436)g(437)e(540)a(581)a(613) found 10% of
the isolates, potentially important development of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. significant proportion study
population harboring p. falciparum seek treatment therefore serves
as reservoir parasite, maintaining natural cycle. national
vector borne disease control programme (nvbdcp) india eliminate malaria,
then hidden parasite burden needs addressed properly. similar study in
other parts country could help determine magnitude problem.
