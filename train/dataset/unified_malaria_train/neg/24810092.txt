cryptosporidium parvum zoonotic agent bears high risk health 
of particularly immunocompromised humans animals. currently available
drugs therapies cryptosporidiosis turn satisfactory, 
intensive research control parasite necessary. genus
cryptosporidium unique within phylum apicomplexa localisation is
intracellular extracytoplasmatic. infection host cells initially a
parasite-driven process, signalling events downstream actions
within cryptosporidium poorly understood. calcium-dependent protein kinases
(cdpks) probably involved regulation invasion egress.
previously described plants, algae apicomplexa, cdpks found 
in vertebrates. thus promising targets pharmaceutical intervention. 
while cdpk1 well characterised toxoplasma gondii (tgcdpk1) plasmodium
falciparum (pfcdpk1), little information exists expression and
function cdpk c. parvum. here, describe results silico
analysis seven cpcdpks. five cpcdpks contain potential sites for
n-myristoylation n-palmitoylation. nested 3' rapid amplification cdna
ends (race)-pcr, expression six cpcdpks resulted distinct bands infected
cell cultures extracts freshly excysted sporozoites. length 3' 
untranslated region (3' utr) described well. results indicate cdpk
expression stage specific mrna level.
