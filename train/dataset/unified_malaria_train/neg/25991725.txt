malaria transmission depends sexual stage plasmodium parasites successfully
invading anopheline mosquito midguts following blood meal. however, the
molecular mechanisms plasmodium invasion mosquito midguts been
fully elucidated. previously, showed genetic polymorphisms the
fibrinogen-related protein 1 (frep1) gene significantly associated with
plasmodium falciparum infection anopheles gambiae, frep1 important 
plasmodium berghei infection mosquitoes. identify frep1
protein secreted mosquito midgut epithelium integrated as
tetramers peritrophic matrix, chitinous matrix formed inside the
midgut lumen blood meal feeding. moreover, show frep1 can
directly bind plasmodia sexual stage gametocytes ookinetes. notably, ablating
frep1 expression targeting frep1 antibodies significantly decreases p.
falciparum infection mosquito midguts. data support the
mosquito-expressed frep1 mediates mosquito midgut invasion multiple species of
plasmodium parasites via anchoring ookinetes peritrophic matrix and
enabling parasites penetrate peritrophic matrix epithelium. thus, 
targeting frep1 limit malaria transmission.
