mosquito anopheles gambiae initiated peripheral signaling the

relationship gene expression olfaction, performed cohort
comparisons antennal transcript abundances five time points blood
meal, key event reproduction disease transmission cycles. found 
that 5,000 transcripts displayed significant abundance differences,
many correlated cluster analysis. within chemosensory gene
families, observed general reduction level chemosensory gene
transcripts, although subset odorant receptors (agors) modestly enhanced
in post-blood-fed samples. integration agor transcript abundance data with
previously characterized agor excitatory odorant response profiles revealed
potential changes antennal odorant receptivity coincided shift
from host-seeking oviposition behaviors blood-fed female mosquitoes.

cumulative, alterations agor transcript levels modulate peripheral odor coding
resulting biologically relevant behavioral effects. moreover, results
