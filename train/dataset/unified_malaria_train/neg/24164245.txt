a dark brown tuft-forming cyanobacterium, morphologically resembling genus
symploca, collected expedition coiba national park, unesco
world heritage site pacific coast panama. phylogenetic analysis 
16s rrna gene sequence indicated 4.5% divergent type strain
for symploca thus likely new genus. fractionation crude extract
led isolation new cytotoxin, designated santacruzamate (1), which
has several structural features common suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
[(2), saha, trade name vorinostat], clinically approved histone deacetylase
(hdac) inhibitor used treat refractory cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. recognition 
of structural similarly 1 saha led characterization of
santacruzamate picomolar level selective inhibitor hdac2, class i
hdac, relatively little inhibition hdac4 hdac6, class ii hdacs.
as result, chemical syntheses santacruzamate well structurally
intriguing hybrid molecule, blends aspects agents (1 2), were
achieved evaluated hdac activity specificity.
