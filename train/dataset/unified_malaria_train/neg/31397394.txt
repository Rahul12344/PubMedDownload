molecular analysis antifolate resistance-associated genes-dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) plasmodium vivax is
important predicting emergence drug resistance to
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp). present study aimed determine the
polymorphism dhfr dhps genes p. vivax field isolates. samples 80
microscopically diagnosed vivax malaria cases collected endemic areas
of malaria hormozgan province iran, june 2010 november 2015. the
two sets codons position 33, 57, 58, 117, 173 dhfr 382, 383, 553
of dhps genes analysed direct sequencing pcr products. majority of
the isolates (70%) harboured wild-type allele p. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) p.
vivax dhps (pvdhps). mutations detected three codons pvdhfr (p33l,
s58r s117n) single codon pvdhps (a383g). novel mutations not
been identified previously codon 459 (d459a) pvdhps also observed. the
high prevalence point mutation well rising triple mutation pvdhfr
and pvdhps genotypes necessitate change programmes guidelines eliminate
p. vivax future.
