accurately identifying targeting human reservoir malaria parasitemia
is critical malaria control, requires reliable sensitive diagnostic
method. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) increasingly used to
diagnose submicroscopic parasitemia. although published studies report the
sensitivity lamp compared nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) ≥
80%, failed use consistent, sensitive diagnostic comparator. 
we used cross-sectional samples children adults tororo, uganda, a
region high declining transmission due indoor residual spraying, to
characterize sensitivity specificity pan-plasmodium lamp detecting
submicroscopic infections. compared lamp results targeting mitochondrial dna
sequence conserved plasmodium species, performed dna extracted from
dried blood spots, gold standard quantitative pcr assay targeting
the var gene acidic terminal sequence plasmodium falciparum (varats qpcr),
performed dna extracted 200 µl whole blood. using lamp varats qpcr
increased detection parasitemia 2- 5-fold, compared microscopy.
among microscopy-negative samples, sensitivity lamp 81.5% for
detecting infection ≥ 1 parasites/µl. however, low density infections were
common, lamp failed identify half infections diagnosed by
varats qpcr, performing overall sensitivity 44.7% detecting
submicroscopic infections ≥ 0.01 parasites/µl. thus, although lamp assay is
more sensitive microscopy, missed significant portion the
submicroscopic reservoir. findings important implications malaria 
control, particularly settings low-density infections predominate.
