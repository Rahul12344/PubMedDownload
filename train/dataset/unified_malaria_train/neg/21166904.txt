aurora kinases compose family conserved ser/thr protein kinases playing
essential roles eukaryotic cell division. date, aurora homologues remain
uncharacterized protozoan phylum apicomplexa. malaria parasites, the
characterization aurora kinases may help understand cell cycle control
during erythrocytic schizogony asynchronous nuclear divisions occur. in
this study, revisited kinome plasmodium falciparum identified three
aurora-related kinases, pfark-1, -2, -3. among these, pfark-1 highly conserved
in malaria parasites also appears conserved across apicomplexa. by
tagging endogenous pfark-1 gene green fluorescent protein (gfp) in
live parasites, show pfark-1-gfp protein forms paired dots associated
with subset nuclei within individual schizonts. immunofluorescence
analysis using anti-α-tubulin antibody strongly suggests recruitment of
pfark-1 duplicated spindle pole bodies entry phase cell
cycle. unsuccessful attempts disrupting pfark-1 gene knockout
construct indicate pfark-1 required parasite growth red
blood cells. study provides new insights cell cycle control of
malaria parasites reports importance aurora kinases potential
targets new antimalarials.
