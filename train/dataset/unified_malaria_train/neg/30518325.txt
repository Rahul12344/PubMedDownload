background: health resilience species natural environments is
increasingly challenged complex anthropogenic stressor combinations including 
climate change, habitat encroachment, chemical contamination. better
understand impacts stressors examined individual- and
combined-stressor impacts malaria infection, food limitation, and
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) exposures gene expression livers western
fence lizards (wfl, sceloporus occidentalis) using custom wfl transcriptome-based
microarrays.
results: computational analysis including annotation enrichment correlation
analysis identified putative functional mechanisms linking transcript expression 
and toxicological phenotypes. tnt exposure increased transcript expression for
genes involved erythropoiesis, potentially response tnt-induced anemia
and/or methemoglobinemia caused dose-specific effects genes involved in
lipid overall energy metabolism consistent hormesis response growth
stimulation low doses adverse decreases lizard growth high doses.
functional enrichment results indicative inhibited potential lipid
mobilization catabolism tnt exposures corresponded increased
inguinal fat weights suggestive decreased overall energy budget.
malaria infection elicited enriched expression multiple immune-related
functions likely corresponding increased white blood cell (wbc) counts. food
limitation alone enriched functions related cellular energy production and
decreased expression immune responses consistent decrease wbc
levels.
conclusions: despite findings, lizards demonstrated immune resilience
to malaria infection food limitation transcriptional results
indicating fully competent immune response malaria, even bio-energetic
constraints. interestingly, tnt malaria individually increased
transcriptional expression immune-related genes increased overall wbc
concentrations blood; responses retained tnt x malaria
combined exposure. results demonstrate complex sometimes unexpected
responses multiple stressors lizards displayed remarkable resiliency
to stressor combinations investigated.
