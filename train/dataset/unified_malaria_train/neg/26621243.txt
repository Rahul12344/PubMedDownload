although role tlrs signalling malaria pathogenesis well established,
contribution individual tlr clinical outcome malaria still remains
inconclusive. given importance tlr2 co-receptors recognising
distinct structural forms key malaria toxins mediating innate immune
response, essential delineate genetic contribution. variants in
tlr1 (i602s) tlr6 (p249s) genotyped pcr-rflp methods, tlr2 (i/d) 
was genotyped pcr 200 samples uncomplicated malaria (um) and
severe malaria (sm). further, sm categorised sub-clinical groups (cm
and ncsm sod mods) analysed. results showed pp genotype of
tlr6 (p249s) significantly common um (p < 0.0001), whereas 'ss'
genotype risk factor sm including sub-clinical categories. the
tlr1 (602s) tlr2 (d) variants significantly high patients cm;
however, negative ld observed tlr2 tlr6 ncsm mods.
haplotype analysis showed significantly high frequency i-i-s haplotype 
forms subclinical sm associated low parasite load sm (p =
0.013). haplotypes i-d-s s-i-p significantly high sod cm,
respectively. tlr6 '249s' variant appeared dominant determinant for
genetic predisposition sm association either tlr2 'd' or
tlr1 '602s' modulates cm development. present study opens several new 
avenues exploration validation future studies different
global settings malaria.
