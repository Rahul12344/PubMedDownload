plasmodium vivax geographically widespread species, burden
has increasingly documented eastern central sudan. p. vivax becomes
the crucial challenge elimination programs; thus effective treatment is
necessary prevent development spread resistant parasites.
therefore, main objective present study provide data the
prevalence molecular markers two genes (pvdhfr pvdhps) associated 
sp resistance nine years as+sp deployment among p. vivax parasites 
eastern central sudan using pcr-rflp. 2012-2013, number 66 blood 
spots obtained filter paper. samples collected treatment 
from febrile patients microscopically positive p. vivax, three 
states eastern central sudan (gezira, gedarif, kassala). mutations
were detected three codons pvdhfr (i13l, s58r, s117n) none in
pvdhps. majority p. vivax parasites double mutations (58r/117n, 58%)
in dhfr gene, parasites wild type dhps gene. addition,
limited distinct haplotypes (n=4) detected. conclusion, prevalence of
mutations associated sp resistance low eastern central sudan. such
information necessary guiding malaria control measures frame of
roll back malaria strategies elimination malaria world.
