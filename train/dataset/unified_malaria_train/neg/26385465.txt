avian blood parasites preliminarily studied east asia, data
are available long-term monitoring. aim study evaluate
the prevalence, genetic diversity, temporal dynamics plasmodium,
haemoproteus, leucocytozoon two passerine communities (one forest one 
urban) north china 2008 2013, well association between
infected lineages host specificities. 633 birds 40 species, 157
individuals (24.8 %) infected; overall prevalence 26.7 % 16.8 % in
two sites, respectively. dominant avian blood parasite genus forest
park changed yearly plasmodium haemoproteus, leucocytozoon 
maintained low infection level. forty-four haplotypes identified by
sequencing 432-bp fragment cytochrome b (cyt b) gene; 70 %
were novel (six plasmodium lineages, 16 haemoproteus lineages, nine
leucocytozoon lineages). based data gathered consecutive years, we
found highly observed lineages haemoproteus showed higher host
diversities plasmodium, infected lineage emel01 (100 %
identity sgs1) take highest host diversity low temporal diversity
of two genera, implying lineage infected great diversity of
species certain years, maintained lower infection level even
disappeared years. results suggest genetic diversity avian
blood parasites east asia high provides scope research. 
addition, compared overall analysis, yearly prevalence monitoring is
important uncovering temporal dynamic host specificity variations over
time.
