a deeper appreciation complex architecture african genomes critical 
to global effort understand human history, biology differential
distribution disease geography ancestry. here, report the
growing engagement african populations genome science providing new
insights forces shaped human genomes the
out-of-africa migrations. result human evolutionary history, african
ancestry populations greatest genomic diversity world, this
diversity important ramifications genomic research. case of
pharmacogenomics, instance, variants consequence limited 
identified populations, diversity within african ancestry
populations precludes summarizing risk across different african ethnic groups.
exposure africans fatal pathogens, plasmodium falciparum, lassa
virus trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, resulted elevated frequencies of
alleles conferring survival advantages infectious diseases, are
maladaptive modern-day environments. illustrating cardiometabolic traits,
we show genomic research african ancestry populations still in
early stages, already many examples novel african
ancestry-specific disease loci discovered. furthermore, the
shorter haplotypes african genomes facilitated fine-mapping loci
discovered human ancestry populations. given insights already gained
from interrogation african genomes, imperative continue and
increase efforts describe genomic risk across african ancestry
populations.
