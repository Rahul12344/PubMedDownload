inevitably complicating reconstruction defined transcriptional map of
gametogenesis. exploiting recent advances transgenic technologies gene 
editing tools, combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting rna
sequencing, separated four distinct cell lineages anopheles
gambiae male gonads: premeiotic, meiotic (primary secondary spermatocytes)
and postmeiotic. comparing overall expression levels x-linked and
autosomal genes across four populations, revealed striking
transcriptional repression x chromosome coincident meiotic phase,
classifiable msci, highlighted genes may evade silencing. in
addition, chromosome-wide median expression ratios premeiotic population
