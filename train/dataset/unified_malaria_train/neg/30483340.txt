background: although plasmodium vivax usually known benign malaria, some
variations parasite result acute sever infection. study
we tried determine genetic variations pvama-1 antigen among the
samples collected form southeastern iran.
methods: two ml blood samples collected edta pre-dosed tubes from
30 p. vivax-infected patients individually 2011 2013. giemsa
stained thick thin blood film prepared patients. a
pcr-rflp technique employed using ecor-1, pvu-ii hind3 restriction
enzymes determine allelic variations antigen.
results: 1300bp gene corresponding pvama-1 selected the
amplification process. among total cases identified study 90% showed 
similar bounds exposed restriction enzymes. nine isolates (accession 
numbers: kf435081-kf435083 jf682785-jf682790) identified registered 
in gene bank. identity among isolates 96% nucleotide level.
dendrogram clarified close relationship among clusters spite of
geographical distribution parasite.
conclusion: study increased data prevalence variation of
pvama-1 alleles amongst p. vivax isolates southeastern parts iran where
besides native population bears considerable afghan pakistani immigrants.
