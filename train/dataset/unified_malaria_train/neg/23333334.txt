interferon beta1 (ifnb1) type interferon mainly known its
antiviral activity, also regulates number anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory functions. studies mouse models cerebral malaria have
established ifnb1 regulates severe malaria pathogenesis increases
overall survival malaria. down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines:
tnf, ifng icam-1, resulting decreased adherence plasmodium falciparum
parasitized rbc capillary wall, entry brain delayed onset of
death. therefore, hypothesized variations ifnb1 gene could regulate
malarial pathogenesis. re-sequenced complete ifnb1 gene along 900bp
of 5' up-stream 500bp 3'-utr 437 individuals malaria endemic
regions orissa chhattisgarh states india. subjects comprised of
173 cases severe malaria, 101 mild malaria, 156 ethnically matched
asymptomatic controls. data statistically compared cases and
controls possible association p. falciparum malarial outcome. two 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps): synonymous c.153c>t (rs1051922) a
non-synonymous substitution c.102c>g (rs139262191, p.ser34arg) identified.
the genotype allele distribution c.153c>t differ significantly
between study groups [mild, χ(2)2=4.10, p-value<0.13 severe χ(2)2=0.06,
p-value<0.97]. interestingly, rare non-synonymous snp (rs139262191) was
observed malaria patients. differences cases controls
did reach statistical significance, however, statistically significant
difference observed asymptomatic control group cerebral
malaria group [or=20.32, 95% ci=1.08-382.63, p-value=0.044]. moreover, the
genotypes cerebral malaria positive negative groups not
significantly different [or=5.58, 95% ci=0.61-50.97, p-value=0.123]. findings
suggest ifnb1 variant, p.ser34arg, might risk factor cerebral
malaria indian populations.
