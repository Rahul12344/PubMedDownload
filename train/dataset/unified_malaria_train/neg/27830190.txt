malaria remains one devastating parasitic diseases worldwide, with
90% malaria deaths africa 2013 attributable plasmodium
falciparum. clinical symptoms malaria include cycles fever,
corresponding parasite rupture red blood cells every 48 h. parasite
pathways involved parasite's ability survive host fever response,
and indeed, functions ~40% p. falciparum genes whole, still
largely unknown. here, evaluated potential scalable forward-genetic
screening methods identify genes involved host fever response. we
performed phenotypic screen genes linked parasite response to
febrile temperatures utilizing selection single-disruption p. falciparum 
mutants generated via random piggybac transposon mutagenesis previous study.
we identified several mutants presenting significant phenotypes febrile
response screens compared wild type, indicating possible roles the
disrupted genes process. present initial studies proof that
forward genetics used gain insight critical factors associated
with parasite biology. importance though p. falciparum genome sequence has
been available many years, ~40% genes informative
annotations, show detectable homology studied organisms.
more still evaluated via genetic methods. scalable forward-genetic 
approaches allow interrogation gene function without pre-existing
knowledge needed hasten understanding parasite biology, will
expedite identification drug targets development future
interventions face spreading resistance existing frontline drugs. in
this work, describe new approach pursue forward-genetic phenotypic
screens p. falciparum identify factors associated virulence. future
large-scale phenotypic screens developed probe interesting
phenomena, considered parallel, prove powerful tool functional
annotation p. falciparum genome, much remains undiscovered.
