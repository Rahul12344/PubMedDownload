sequence activity mapping technologies rapidly developing, enabling the
generation isolation mutations conferring novel phenotypes. used
the crispr enabled trackable genome engineering (create) technology to
investigate inhibition essential ispc gene native genomic
context escherichia coli. created full saturation library 33 sites
proximal ligand binding pocket challenged library the
antimalarial drug fosmidomycin, targets ispc gene product, dxr. this
selection especially challenging since relatively weak e. coli, 
multiple naturally occurring pathways resistance. identified several
previously unreported mutations confer fosmidomycin resistance, highly
conserved sites also exist pathogens including malaria-inducing
plasmodium falciparum. approach may implications isolation of
resistance-conferring mutations may affect design future generations
of fosmidomycin-based drugs.
