emerging pathogens undermine initiatives control global health impact of
infectious diseases. zoonotic malaria exception. plasmodium knowlesi, a
malaria parasite southeast asian macaques, entered human population.
p. knowlesi, like plasmodium falciparum, reach high parasitaemia human
infections, world health organization guidelines severe malaria list 
hyperparasitaemia among measures severe malaria infections. not
all patients p. knowlesi infections develop hyperparasitaemia, is
important determine why. isolate variability erythrocyte invasion, 
efficiency seems key. investigate idea particular alleles two
p. knowlesi erythrocyte invasion genes, p. knowlesi normocyte binding protein
pknbpxa pknbpxb, influence parasitaemia human disease progression.
pknbpxa pknbpxb reference dna sequences generated five
geographically temporally distinct p. knowlesi patient isolates. polymorphic 
regions gene (approximately 800 bp) identified haplotyping 147
patient isolates locus. parasitaemia study cohort associated
with markers disease severity including liver renal dysfunction,
haemoglobin, platelets lactate, (r = ≥ 0.34, p =  <0.0001 all).
seventy-five 51 pknbpxa pknbpxb haplotypes resolved 138 (94%) and
134 (92%) patient isolates respectively. haplotypes formed twelve pknbpxa and
two pknbpxb allelic groups. patients infected parasites particular
pknbpxa pknbpxb alleles within groups significantly higher
parasitaemia markers disease severity. study strongly suggests
that p. knowlesi invasion gene variants contribute parasite virulence. we
focused two invasion genes, anticipate additional virulent loci
will identified pathogen genome-wide studies. multiple sustained
entries diverse pathogen human population must give cause for
concern malaria elimination strategists southeast asian region.
