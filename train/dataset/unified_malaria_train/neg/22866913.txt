background: microarray studies using vitro cultures synchronized,
blood-stage plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites revealed a
'just-in-time' cascade gene expression indication these
transcriptional patterns remain stable even presence external
stressors. however, direct analysis transcription p. falciparum blood-stage
parasites obtained blood infected patients suggests parasite
gene expression may modulated factors present vivo environment of
the host. aim study examine changes gene expression 
rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium yoelii 17x, varying vivo setting
of replication.
methods: using p. yoelii 17x parasites replicating vivo, differential gene
expression parasites isolated individual mice, independent
infections, ascending, peak descending parasitaemia the
presence absence host antibody responses examined using p. yoelii dna 
microarrays. genome-wide analysis identify coordinated changes groups 
genes associated specific biological pathways primary focus, although 
an analysis expression patterns two multi-gene families p. yoelii,
the yir pyst-a families, also completed.
results: across experimental conditions, transcription surprisingly stable
with little evidence distinct transcriptional states consistent
changes specific pathways. differential gene expression greatest when
comparing differences due parasite load and/or host cell availability.
however, number differentially expressed genes generally low. genes
that differentially expressed, many involved biologically diverse pathways. 
there little differential expression members yir pyst-a
multigene families encode polymorphic proteins associated membrane 
of infected erythrocytes. however, relatively large number genes 
expressed blood-stage infection regardless experimental condition.
conclusions: taken together, results indicate 1) p. yoelii gene
expression remains stable presence changing host environment, 2) 
concurrent expression large number polymorphic yir pyst-a genes, 
rather differential expression response specific host factors, may 
itself limit effectiveness host immune responses.
