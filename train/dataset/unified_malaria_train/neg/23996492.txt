we developed expression system capable producing large quantities of
low cost, specific peptides either his12 -tagged, biotinylated, or
unlabeled. flexibility peptide system suitable interaction
studies via surface plasmon resonance (spr), co-crystallization, and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. gene blocks containing peptide sequences of
interest addition 15 amino acid avitag™, cloned vector
expressing n-terminal maltose binding protein. constructs expressed
and purified, molecular weights recombinant proteins were
estimated analytical size exclusion chromatography. successful situ
biotinylation avitag confirmed anti-biotin western blot was
used coupling surface plasmon resonance chip. able to
validate, proof concept study, specific protein-protein interaction
of plasmodium falciparum aldolase (pfaldolase) three different cytoplasmic
adhesin tail peptides family thrombospondin-related anonymous
proteins (traps), determine affinities. method peptide
production enables high yield production peptides two-day, cost effective
manner. tool allow us screen protein-protein interaction
inhibitors directed toward liver stage blood stage complexes the
glideosome plasmodium species. adaptation tool allow researchers 
to pursue studies protein-protein interactions.
