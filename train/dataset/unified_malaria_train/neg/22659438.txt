excessive production proinflammatory cytokines, elicited mostly th1 cells, 
is important cause cerebral malaria (cm). dendritic cells (dcs), critical
link innate adaptive immune responses, rely heavily toll-like
receptor (tlr) signaling. using c57bl/6 mice infected plasmodium berghei
anka (pba) experimental cm model, first confirmed inhibition of
tlr9 suppressive oligodeoxynucleotides protected mice cm. addition 
being well-known antimalarial, chloroquine (cq) used an
immunomodulator endocytic tlrs inhibits endosomal acidification. we
found immediately shortly infection pba, treatment 
a single dose 50 mg/kg cq protected mice experimental cm. cq
treatments significantly inhibited expression tlr9 mhc-ii dcs, and
reduced number myeloid plasmatocytoid dcs 3 5 days after
infection. consequently, activation cd4+ cells, especially expansion 
the th1 subsets, dramatically inhibited cq treated groups, was
accompanied remarkable decline production th1 type proinflammatory
mediators ifn-γ, tnf-α, nitric oxide. taken together, results
corroborated involvement tlr9 cm pathogenesis suggest that
interference activation receptor promising strategy to
prevent deleterious inflammatory response mediating pathogenesis severity 
malaria.
