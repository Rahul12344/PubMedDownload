background: malaria parasites undergo, vertebrate host, developmental
switch asexual replication sexual differentiation leading the
formation gametocytes, form able survive mosquito vector.
regulation onset sexual phase remains largely unknown and
represents important gap understanding parasite's complex
biology.
methods: expression function nima-related kinase pfnek-4 during
the early sexual development human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum 
were investigated, using three types transgenic plasmodium falciparum 3d7
lines: (i) episomally expressing pfnek-4-gfp fusion protein control
of cognate pfnek-4 promoter; (ii) episomally expressing negative positive 
selectable markers, yeast cytosine deaminase-uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase,
or human dihydrofolate reductase, control pfnek-4 promoter; 
(iii) lacking functional pfnek-4 gene. parasite transfectants analysed 
fluorescence microscopy flow cytometry. vitro growth rate gametocyte
formation determined giemsa-stained blood smears.
results: pfnek-4-gfp protein found expressed stage ii v
gametocytes and, unexpectedly, subset asexual-stage parasites undergoing 
schizogony. culture conditions stimulating gametocyte formation resulted in
significant increase schizont subpopulation. moreover, sorted asexual
parasites expressing pfnek-4-gfp protein displayed elevated gametocyte
formation returned vitro culture presence fresh red blood cells,
when compared gfp- parasites initial population. negative
selection asexual parasites expressing pfnek-4 showed marginal reduction 
growth rate, whereas positive selection caused marked reduction in
parasitaemia, sufficient completely abolish proliferation.
pfnek-4- clones affected asexual growth produced normal
numbers stage v gametocytes.
conclusions: results indicate pfnek-4 strictly
gametocyte-specific, expressed small subset asexual parasites
displaying high rate conversion sexual development. pfnek-4 required
for erythrocytic schizogony gametocytogenesis. first study to
report use molecular marker sorting sexually-committed
schizont stage p. falciparum parasites, opens way molecular
characterization pre-differentiated subpopulation.
