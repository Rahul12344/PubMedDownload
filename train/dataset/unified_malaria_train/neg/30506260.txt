malaria serious preventable treatable infectious disease is
found 100 countries around world. correct rapid diagnosis of
malaria infection rescue patient getting sicker reduces risk
of disease spreading among humans. chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast an
attractive platform expressing malaria antigens capable of
folding complex proteins, including requiring disulfide bond formation,
while lack ability glycosylate proteins; valuable quality malaria
protein expression system, since plasmodium parasite lacks n-linked
glycosylation machinery. study, cell-traversal protein ookinetes 
sporozoites (celtos) antigen plasmodium falciparum expressed the
chloroplast c. reinhardtii highly sensitive specific indirect elisa 
test developed using c. reinhardtii expressed pfceltos detect malaria.
results obtained demonstrated expressed recombinant pfceltos accumulates 
a soluble, properly folded functional protein within c. reinhardtii
chloroplast indirect elisa using sera malaria-positive donors suggested 
the potential use expressed pfceltos malaria antigen diagnosis tests.
