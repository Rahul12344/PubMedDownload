unlike pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections p.
falciparum frequently composed genetic siblings. genetic siblings
are result sexual reproduction coinfect host when
cotransmitted mosquito. degree coinfecting strains are
related varies among infections populations. sexual recombination
occurs within mosquito, relatedness cotransmitted strains could depend
on transmission dynamics, little actually known factors that
influence relatedness cotransmitted strains. part uncertainty stems
from incomplete understanding within-host within-vector dynamics
affect cotransmission. cotransmission difficult examine experimentally 
can explored using computational model. developed malaria transmission 
model simulates sexual reproduction order understand determines
the relatedness cotransmitted strains. study highlights the
relatedness cotransmitted strains depends within-host and
within-vector dynamics including complexity infection. also used our
transmission model analyze genetic relatedness polygenomic infections
following series multiple transmission events examined effects of
superinfection. understanding factors influence relatedness of
cotransmitted strains could lead better understanding the
population-genetic correlates transmission therefore important for
public health.
