the new partnership africa's development (nepad) agency recognizes that
africa period transition demands exploring and
harnessing safe advances made science-based innovations including modern
biotechnology. advance science biotechnology africa effectively,
while time safeguarding human health environment, african
union (au) adopted high-level panel report modern biotechnology entitled,
freedom innovate, advocated coevolutionary approach where
technology development goes hand hand regulation. furthermore, au
member states parties cartagena protocol biosafety (cpb), legally
binding international agreement negotiated, concluded adopted within the
framework convention biological diversity. seeks guide parties 
in developing systems environmentally sound management modern
biotechnology applications. currently, 49Â au member states signed and
ratified cpb, 12 passed biosafety laws. african union (au)
member states different stages development regulatory frameworks
for applications modern biotechnology, include genetically modified (gm)
products emerging technologies. biosafety regulatory frameworks
comprise: biotechnology and/or biosafety policy; laws, regulations and
guidelines; administrative systems; decision-making systems; mechanisms for
public engagement. assist member states implement functional regulatory
frameworks agriculture health applications, nepad agency
established african biosafety network expertise (abne) african
medicines regulatory harmonization (amrh). currently, transgenic insects gm
crops regulated competent national authorities whose mandate derives 
national biosafety laws. gm crops, lot research conducted to
the confined field trial (cft) multi-location trials stages number of
african countries. burkina faso fully functional containment facilities for
transgenic mosquitoes mali uganda developing theirs. burkina
faso regulatory agency granted permits already received sets of
sterile mosquito eggs trials contained facility. instructive 
note abne amrh worked national regional regulatory
bodies africa enhance technical capacities informed decision
making, adoption best practices, compliance international standards. 
it backdrop rich blend on-the-ground knowledge,
experience, expertise, insight context political sensitivities
of member states nepad agency seeks expand existing support. this
would include capacity strengthening regulation emerging technologies,
