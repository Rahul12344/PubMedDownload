merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1), major asexual blood stage antigen, and
circumsporozoite protein (csp), component sporozoites includes a
plasmodium vivax b-cell epitope, strong candidates use malaria
vaccine. chimeric recombinant gene containing portions msp-1 csp
from p. vivax separated pro-gly linker motif generated. construct gene
was named mlc (msp-1, linker, csp). mlc chimeric recombinant protein 
a molecular weight approximately 25 kda expressed escherichia coli, as
determined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(sds-page) analysis. purified chimeric protein reacted sera of
patients infected p. vivax sera uninfected patients
according western blot analysis. chimeric protein reacted well sera
of malaria patients (109/115, 94.78%) assessed enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa). balb/c mice orally immunized mlc 
chimeric recombinant protein successfully produced antigen-specific antibodies.
additionally, levels th1-associated cytokines il-12(p40), tnf-α, ifn-γ
were significantly increased spleens balb/c mice. therefore, e.
coli-expressed mlc chimeric recombinant protein might used valuable
vaccine candidate oral immunization vivax malaria.
