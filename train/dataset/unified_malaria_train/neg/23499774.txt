malaria represents one important causes mortality morbidity in
africa. variability clinical presentation partly due host genetic
polymorphisms. among them, human leukocyte antigen (hla) class class ii
alleles may responsible malaria susceptibility; however less known
about possible role non classical hla molecules. among them, hla-g a
tolerogenic molecule immunomodulatory properties, differs from
classical hla class molecules lower genetic diversity, tissue expression
and function. although primarily associated maternal-fetal tolerance, hla-g 
is known involved wide range physiopathological conditions,
such tumor, autoimmunity, transplantation, inflammation viral infection by
suppressing function various immune cells. work, present the
first evidence association hla-g 3'utr polymorphisms malaria
infection. precisely, showed hla-g polymorphisms associated with
asymptomatic infection two parasitological phenotypes, intensity of
plasmodium falciparum infection mean level parasite density. the
allele+3187g haplotype (utr-1,
14bp-del/3001c/3003t/3010g/3035c/3052c/3142c/3187g/3196c) associated with
lower level infection dominant model, haplotype utr-3
(del/3001c/3003t/3010c/3035c/3152c/3142g/3187a/3196c) associated high
levels infection recessive model. conclusion, although further
investigations way better address possible involvement the
hla-g molecule control p. falciparum infection, work presents 
first evidence association hla-g polymorphisms malaria
infection. investigations way take account the
particularities african populations.
