apicoplasts vestigial plastids apicomplexan parasites like plasmodium, the
causative agent malaria. apicomplexan parasites dependant their
apicoplasts synthesis various molecules unable scavenge
in sufficient quantity host, makes apicoplasts attractive drug
targets. proteins known plastid phosphate translocators (ppts) embedded in
the outer apicoplast membrane responsible import carbon,
energy reducing power drive anabolic synthesis organelle. we
investigated ppt targeted outer apicoplast membrane the
human malaria parasite p. falciparum. showed transmembrane domain is
likely act recessed signal anchor direct protein the
endomembrane system, tyrosine cytosolic n-terminus the
protein essential targeting, one more, yet unidentified, factors
are also essential direct protein outer apicoplast membrane.
