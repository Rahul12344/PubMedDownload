background: advanced oxidation protein products (aopp) newly identified
efficient oxidative stress biomarkers. longitudinal birth cohort effects
were investigated genetic polymorphisms five oxidative pathway genes on
aopp levels.
methods: study part three-arm randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial. three hundred twelve children included 
present study aopp levels measured 2.5, 5.5, 10.5, 15 24 months of
age. twelve polymorphisms genotyped five oxidative stress pathway genes: 
glutathione reductase (gsr), glutamylcysteine synthetase (gclc), glutathione
s-transferase (gst) p1, haem oxygenase 1 (hmox1) superoxide dismutase 2
(sod2) 298 children. 284 children assessed anaemia clinical
malaria infection age 24 months.
results: two principal components (pca1 pca2) derived aopp
levels measured five time points. pca1 significantly associated with
anaemia (p = 0.0002), pca2 clinical malaria infection (p = 0.047). in
the k-means cluster analysis based levels aopp, children clustered
into two groups: group (lower aopp levels) group b (higher aopp levels).
the cluster membership significantly associated anaemia (p =0.003) as
well gsr rs3594 polymorphism (p = 0.037). mixed linear regression
analyses found single nucleotide polymorphisms gclc rs10948751 hmox1
rs17885925 significantly associated aopp levels (p = 0.030 p =
0.027, respectively).
conclusion: plasma aopp levels predictive anaemia oxidative stress
markers clinical malaria infection two year old children. several
polymorphisms gclc, gsr hmox1 genes associated oxidative stress 
status children.
