background: although gene overlapping common feature prokaryote and
mitochondria genomes, genes also identified many eukaryotes.
the overlapping genes eukaryotes extensively rearranged even between
closely related species. study, investigated retention and
rearrangement positionally overlapping genes mosquitoes aedes
aegypti (dengue virus vector) anopheles gambiae (malaria vector). the
overlapping gene pairs a. aegypti compared orthologs of
other selected insects conduct several hypothesis driven investigations
relating evolution rearrangement overlapping genes.
results: results show much ~10% predicted genes a.
aegypti a. gambiae localized positional overlapping manner.
furthermore, study shows differential abundance introns simple
sequence repeats significant association positional rearrangement of
overlapping genes two species. gene expression analysis further
suggests antisense transcripts generated oppositely oriented
overlapping genes differentially regulated may important regulatory 
functions mosquitoes. data shows synonymous and
non-synonymous mutations differential non-significant effect on
overlapping localization orthologous genes insect genomes.
conclusion: gene overlapping insects may species-specific evolutionary
process evident non-dependency gene overlapping species
phylogeny. based results, study suggests overlapping genes may
have played important role genome evolution insects.
