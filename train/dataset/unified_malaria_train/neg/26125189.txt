plasmodium vivax geographically widespread human malaria parasite. to
analyze patterns microsatellite diversity population structure across
countries different transmission intensity, genotyping data 11
microsatellite markers either generated compiled 841 isolates from
four continents collected 1999-2008. diversity highest south-east asia 
(mean allelic richness 10.0-12.8), intermediate south pacific (8.1-9.9)
madagascar sudan (7.9-8.4), lowest south america central asia
(5.5-7.2). reduced panel 3 markers sufficient identify approx.
90% haplotypes south pacific, african se-asian populations, but
only 60-80% latin american populations, suggesting typing 2-6 markers,
depending level endemicity, sufficient epidemiological studies. 
clustering analysis showed distinct clusters peru brazil, little
sub-structuring observed within africa, se-asia south pacific.
isolates uzbekistan exceptional, near-clonal parasite population
was observed clearly separated populations (fst>0.2).
outside central asia fst values highest (0.11-0.16) south american
and populations, lowest (0.04-0.07) populations from
south-east asia south pacific. comparisons p. vivax
populations four continents indicated transmission intensity, 
but also geographical isolation affect diversity population structure.
however, high effective population size results slow changes these
parameters. persistency must taken account assessing impact
of control programs genetic structure parasite populations.
