schistosomiasis globally important helminthic disease humans animals,
and second common parasitic disease malaria. eggs produced
by mature females responsible disease's occurrence spread. frzb2,
a secreted frizzled-related protein, inhibit wnt signalling competitive
binding specific frizzled protein receptor. study, complete
gene sequence sjfrzb2 obtained using 3'-rapid amplification cdna
ends technology. sjfrzb2 transcript levels different stages s. japonicum
maturation evaluated quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis. sjfrzb2 
expressed developmental stages examined exhibited highest
transcription level 7-day-old worms, gradually decreased the
growth developmental stages reach lowest level 18Â days
post-infection. sjfrzb2 gene expression higher female worms male
worms significantly higher female worms single-sex infection
than female worms bisexual infection. functions sjfrzb2 were
explored via small interfering rna-based gene silencing approach the
soaking method. results showed sjfrzb2 gene knockdown impaired the
growth development s. japonicum mice, affecting survival
and morphological structure worms also reproductive ability 
the viability produced eggs. collectively, observations imply that
frzb2 may novel target development immuno- and/or small
molecule-based therapeutics control schistosomiasis fecundity and
transmission.
