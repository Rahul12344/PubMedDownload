background: nearly half world's population (3.2 billion people) at
risk malaria 2015, resistance current therapies major concern. 
while standard care includes drug combinations, pressing need
to identify new combinations bypass current resistance mechanisms. in
the work presented here, combined transcriptional drug repositioning/discovery 
and machine learning approach proposed.
methods: integrated approach utilizes gene expression data from
patient-derived samples, combination large-scale anti-malarial
combination screening data, predict synergistic compound combinations for
three plasmodium falciparum strains (3d7, dd2 hb3). single compounds and
combinations predicted active prospectively tested experiment.
results: one predicted single agents, apicidin, active ac50
values 74.9, 84.1 74.9 nm 3d7, dd2 hb3 p. falciparum strains 
its maximal safe plasma concentration human 547.6 ± 136.6 nm. apicidin at
the safe dose 500 nm kills average 97% parasite. synergy
prediction algorithm exhibited overall precision recall 83.5 65.1% for
mild-to-strong, 48.8 75.5% moderate-to-strong 12.0 62.7% for
strong synergies. prospectively predicted combinations, as
tacrolimus-hydroxyzine raloxifene-thioridazine, exhibited significant synergy
across three p. falciparum strains included study.
conclusions: systematic approaches play important role accelerating
discovering novel combinational therapies malaria enables selecting
novel synergistic compound pairs informed cost-effective manner.
