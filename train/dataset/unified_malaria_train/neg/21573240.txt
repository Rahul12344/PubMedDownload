global, genomic responses erythrocytes infectious agents been
difficult measure cells e-nucleated. previously
demonstrated vitro matured, nucleated erythroblast cells the
orthochromatic stage efficiently infected human malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum. show infection orthochromatic cells induces
change 609 host genes. 592 transcripts up-regulated and
associated metabolic chaperone pathways unique p. falciparum
infection, well wide range signaling pathways also induced in
related apicomplexan infections mouse hepatocytes human fibroblast cells.
our data additionally show polychromatophilic cells, precede the
orthochromatic stage infected co-cultured p. falciparum,
up-regulate small set genes, least two associated with
pathways hematopoiesis and/or erythroid cell development. data support
the idea p. falciparum affects erythropoiesis multiple stages during
erythroblast differentiation. p. falciparum may modulate gene expression 
in bystander erythroblasts thus influence pathways erythrocyte
development. study provides benchmark host erythroblast cell
response infection p. falciparum.
