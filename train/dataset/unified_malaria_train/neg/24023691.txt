conventional reverse genetic approaches study plasmodium malaria parasite 
gene function limited, applicable. hence, new inducible systems are
needed. describe method control p. falciparum gene expression in
which target genes bearing glms ribozyme 3' untranslated region are
efficiently knocked transgenic p. falciparum parasites response to
glucosamine inducer. using reporter genes, show glms ribozyme cleaves
reporter mrna vivo leading reduction mrna expression following
glucosamine treatment. glucosamine-induced ribozyme activation led efficient
reduction reporter protein, could rapidly reversed removing the
inducer. glms ribozyme validated reverse-genetic tool integration
into essential gene antifolate drug target dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase (pfdhfr-ts). glucosamine treatment transgenic
parasites led rapid efficient knockdown pfdhfr-ts mrna protein.
pfdhfr-ts knockdown led growth/arrest mutant phenotype hypersensitivity 
to pyrimethamine. glms ribozyme may thus tool study essential
genes p. falciparum parasite species amenable transfection.
