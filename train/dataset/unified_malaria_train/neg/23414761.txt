placental malaria (pm) major cause fetal growth restriction, yet the
underlying mechanism unclear. complement c5a c5a receptor levels are
increased pm. c5a implicated fetal growth restriction in
non-infection-based animal models. case-control study 492 pregnant
malawian women, find elevated c5a levels associated increased
risk delivering small-for-gestational-age infant. c5a significantly
increased pm negatively correlated angiogenic factor
angiopoietin-1 positively correlated angiopoietin-2, soluble endoglin,
and vascular endothelial growth factor. genetic pharmacological blockade of
c5a receptor mouse model pm resulted greater fetoplacental
vessel development, reduced placental vascular resistance, improved fetal
growth survival. data suggest c5a drives fetal growth restriction 
in pm dysregulation angiogenic factors essential placental
vascular remodeling resulting placental vascular insufficiency.
