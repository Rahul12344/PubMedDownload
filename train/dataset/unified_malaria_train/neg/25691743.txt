the virulence plasmodium falciparum, causative agent deadliest form
of human malaria, attributed ability evade human immunity through
antigenic variation. parasites alternate expression variable
antigens, encoded members multicopy gene family named var. immune evasion
through antigenic variation depends tight regulation var gene expression,
ensuring single var gene expressed time rest the
family maintained transcriptionally silent. understanding single gene is
chosen activation critical understanding mutually exclusive expression
but remains mystery. here, show antisense long noncoding rnas (lncrnas)
initiating var introns associated single active var gene the
time cell cycle single var upstream promoter active. we
demonstrate antisense transcripts incorporated chromatin, and
that expression antisense lncrnas trans triggers activation a
silent var gene sequence- dose-dependent manner. hand,
interference lncrnas using complement peptide nucleic acid molecules
down-regulated active var gene, erased epigenetic memory, induced
expression switching. altogether, data provide evidence antisense 
lncrnas play key role regulating var gene activation mutually exclusive 
expression.
