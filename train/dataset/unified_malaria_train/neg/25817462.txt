plasmodium ovale curtisi plasmodium ovale wallikeri distinct species of
malaria parasite sympatric throughout tropics, except the
americas. despite complete overlap geographic range, two species do
not recombine. although morphologically similar, two taxa must possess
distinct characters prevent recombination them. hypothesised
that proteins required sexual reproduction sufficiently diverged between
the two species prevent recombination mosquito blood meal which
gametocytes species ingested. order investigate possible
barriers inter-species mating p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri,
homologues genes encoding sexual stage proteins plasmodia were
identified compared two species. database searches motifs
for 6-cysteine, limulus coagulation factor c domain-containing proteins other
relevant sexual stage proteins genus plasmodium performed the
available p. ovale curtisi partial genome database (wellcome trust sanger
institute, uk). sequence fragments obtained used basis pcr
walking along gene interest reference isolates p. ovale
curtisi p. ovale wallikeri. sequence alignment homologues gene
in species showed complete dimorphism across isolates. conclusion,
substantial divergence sexual stage proteins two p. ovale spp. was
observed, providing evidence recombine nature.
incompatibility proteins involved sexual development fertilisation thus
remains plausible explanation observed lack natural recombination
between p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri.
