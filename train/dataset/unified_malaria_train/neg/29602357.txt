diptera (true flies) among diverse holometabolan insect orders and
were first eukaryotic order representative genome fully sequenced. 
110 fly species publically available genome assemblies many hundreds 
population-level genomes generated model organisms drosophila
melanogaster malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae. comparative genomics
carried phylogenetic context illuminating many aspects fly
biology, providing unprecedented insight variability genome structure,
gene content, genetic mechanisms, rates patterns evolution genes,
populations, species. despite rich availability genomic resources in
flies, remain many fly lineages new genome sequencing efforts
should directed. efforts would valuable fly families clades
that exhibit multiple origins key fly behaviors blood feeding,
phytophagy, parasitism, pollination, mycophagy.
