the early transcribed membrane proteins (etramps) family small, highly
charged transmembrane proteins unique malaria parasites. members the
etramp family localized parasitophorous vacuole membrane that
separates intracellular parasite host cell thus presumably 
a role host-parasite interactions. although previously shown two
etramps critical rodent malaria parasite liver-stage development, the
importance etramps parasite life cycle remains unknown. here, 
we comprehensively identify nine new etramps genome rodent malaria 
parasite plasmodium yoelii, elucidate conservation malaria
parasites. etramp expression profiles diverse throughout parasite life
cycle measured rt-pcr. epitope tagging two etramps demonstrates protein 
expression blood liver stages, reveals differences their
timing expression subcellular localization. gene targeting studies
of nine uncharacterized etramps show two refractory to
deletion thus likely essential blood-stage replication. seven etramps are
not essential life cycle stage. systematic characterization the
members etramp family reveals diversity importance family
member interface host parasite throughout developmental
cycle malaria parasite.
