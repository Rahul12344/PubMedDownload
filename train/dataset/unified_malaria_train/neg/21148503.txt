background: 2008, guinea-bissau introduced artemether-lumefantrine for
treatment uncomplicated malaria. previously, 3 times standard dose of
chloroquine, probably efficacious plasmodium falciparum the
resistance-associated chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) 76t allele, 
routinely used. present study compared efficacy tolerability a
double standard dose chloroquine efficacy tolerability of
artemether-lumefantrine.
methods: randomized open-label clinical trial, artemether-lumefantrine or
chloroquine (50 mg/kg) given 6 divided doses 3 days children aged
6 months--15 years uncomplicated p. falciparum monoinfection. drug
concentrations measured day 7. p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene
n86y pfcrt k76t alleles identified.
results: polymerase chain reaction-adjusted day 28 42 treatment
efficacies 162 (97%) 168 155 (97%) 161, respectively, for
artemether-lumefantrine 150 (95%) 158 138 (94%) 148, respectively, 
for chloroquine. parasites resistance-associated pfcrt 76t were
treated, day 28 efficacy chloroquine 87%. severe drug-related
adverse events detected. symptom resolution similar both
treatments.
conclusions: treatments achieved world health organization-recommended
efficacy antimalarials adopted policy. high-dose chloroquine 
treatment regimes evaluated aim assessing
chloroquine potential partner drug artemisinin derivatives. clinical
trials registration. nct00426439.
