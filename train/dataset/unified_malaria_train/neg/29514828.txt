this article report symposium entitled "physiological regulation of
drug metabolism transport" sponsored american society pharmacology
and experimental therapeutics held experimental biology 2017 meeting
in chicago, il. contributions physiologic pathophysiological
regulation drug-metabolizing enzymes transporters interindividual
variability drug metabolism increasingly recognized many cases 
not well understood. presentations herein discuss phenomenology,
consequences, mechanism regulation. cyp2d6 transgenic mice used 
to provide insights mechanism regulation enzyme pregnancy,
via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, small heterodimer partner, retinoids.
regulation intestinal hepatic drug-processing enzymes intestinal
microbiota via tryptophan metabolites investigated. potential
impact parasitic infections human drug metabolism clearance was
assessed mice infected schistosoma mansoni plasmodium chabaudi
chabaudi as, produced widespread profound effects murine
hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. finally, induction abcc drug efflux
transporters fasting investigated. demonstrated occur via a
camp, protein kinase a/nuclear factor-e2-related factor 2/sirtuin 1 pathway via
antioxidant response elements abcc genes.
