background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd), x-linked
inherited enzymopathy, barrier malaria control primaquine cannot 
be readily applied radical cure individuals condition. endemic
areas, including afghanistan, g6pd status vivax patients not
routinely determined drug rarely, ever, prescribed even though is
included recommended treatment local, regional global guidelines.
this study assessed prevalence genotype g6pd deficiency afghan
populations examined need routine g6pd testing malaria treatment
and control tool.
methods: cross-sectional household survey conducted using random sampling
in five afghan cities determine prevalence g6pd deficiency afghan
ethnic groups. filter-paper blood spots analysed phenotypic g6pd
deficiency using fluorescent spot test. molecular analysis conducted to
identify genetic basis disorder.
results: overall, 45/1,436 (3.1%) people g6pd deficient, 36/728 (5.0%)
amongst males 9/708 (1.3%) amongst females. amongst males prevalence 
highest pashtun ethnic group (10%, 26/260) tajik males was
8/250 (3.2%); hazara males 1/77 (1.3%) uzbek males 0/125.
genetic testing deficiency showed the
mediterranean type (med-) characterized c-t change codon 563 g6pd 
gene.
conclusion: prevalence g6pd deficiency afghanistan varies considerably by
ethnic group predominantly mediterranean type. g6pd deficient
individuals susceptible potentially severe life-threatening haemolysis
after standard primaquine treatment. aim increasing access radical
treatment vivax successful reliable g6pd testing needs made
routinely available within health system.
