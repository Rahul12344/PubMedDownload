genetic analysis molecular markers critical tracking emergence
and/or spread artemisinin resistant parasites. clinical isolates collected 
western kenya pre- post- introduction artemisinin combination therapies
(acts) genotyped snp positions regions strong selection signatures 
on chromosome 13 14, described southeast asia (sea). twenty five snps
were genotyped using sequenom massarray pfmdr1 gene copy number real-time 
pcr. parasite clearance half-life vitro drug sensitivity testing were
performed using standard methods. one hundred twenty nine isolates were
successfully analyzed. fifteen snps present pre-acts isolates six 
post-acts. none snps showed association parasite clearance half-life.
post-acts parasites significantly higher pfmdr1 copy number compared to
pre-acts. seven eight parasites multiple pfmdr1 post-acts. in
vitro ic50s compared parasites single vs. multiple gene copies,
only amodiaquine piperaquine reached statistical significance. data showed
snps chromosome 13 14 different frequency trend western kenya
parasites compared sea. increase pfmdr1 gene copy consistent recent
studies african parasites. data suggests genetic signature artemisinin
resistance africa might different sea.
