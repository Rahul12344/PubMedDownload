p. falciparum causes deadly form malaria, resulting the
adherence infected red blood cells blood vessels. blood stage of
infection, parasite secretes large number proteins host
erythrocyte. secretion 20-member family protein kinases known fikk
kinases, conserved phe-ile-lys-lys sequence motif, unique p.
falciparum. identification physiological substrates kinases may
provide perspective importance fikk kinase activity p. falciparum
virulence. demonstrate, first time, heterologous expression and
purification fikk kinase (pffk4.1, pfd1165w). recombinant kinase is
active general substrates phosphorylates itself. demonstrated 
kinase activity, incubated recombinant fk4.1 parasite human
erythrocyte lysates. parasite-derived substrates identified. however,
treatment erythrocyte ghosts shows fikk kinase fk4.1 phosphorylates
dematin, cytoskeletal protein found red blood cell spectrin-actin
junction.
