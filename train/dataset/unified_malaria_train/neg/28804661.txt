human lymphatic filariasis vector-borne disease mainly caused the
parasitic nematode wuchereria bancrofti transmitted worldwide within the
tropical subtropical regions. singapore endemic bancroftian
filariasis recent reports scarce disease nearly forgotten. the
case report presented reports incidental hospital laboratory finding 
an asymptomatic microfilaremia relapsing plasmodium vivax imported case
during malaria treatment follow-up appointment. parasite identified 
microscopy w. bancrofti retrospective investigation sample
collected malaria onset found also positive. additional
confirmation obtained dna amplification, sequencing, phylogenetic
analysis mitochondrial cox1 gene related parasite w.
bancrofti strains indian region. considering large proportion of
asymptomatic filariasis microfilaremia, high number migrants and
travellers arriving surrounding endemic countries, common
presence local competent mosquito vectors, singapore remains vulnerable the
introduction, reemergence, spread lymphatic filariasis. report
brings shadow potential risk lymphatic filariasis in
singapore could help maintain awareness parasitic disease and
its public health importance.
