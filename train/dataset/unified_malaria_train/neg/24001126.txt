background: anopheles subpictus sensu lato major malaria vector south and
southeast asia. based initially polytene chromosome inversion polymorphism,
and subsequently morphological characterization, four sibling species a-d were
reported india. present study uses molecular methods further
characterize identify sibling species sri lanka.
methods: mosquitoes sri lanka morphologically identified species and
sequenced ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-2 (its2) the
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit-i (coi) genes. sequences,
together others genbank, used construct phylogenetic trees 
parsimony haplotype networks test genetic population structure.
results: its2 coi sequences revealed two divergent clades indicating
that subpictus complex sri lanka composed two genetically distinct
species correspond species species b india. phylogenetic
analysis showed species species b form monophyletic clade but
instead share genetic similarity anopheles vagus anopheles sundaicus
s.l., respectively. allele specific identification method based its2
variation developed reliable identification species b sri
lanka.
conclusion: multidisciplinary studies needed establish species
status chromosomal forms subpictus complex. study emphasizes
the difficulties using morphological characters species identification 
an. subpictus s.l. sri lanka demonstrates utility allele
specific identification method used characterize differential 
bio-ecological traits species b sri lanka.
