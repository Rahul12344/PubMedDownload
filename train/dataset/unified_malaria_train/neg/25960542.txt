the liver stages malaria parasite clinically silent constitute
ideal targets causal prophylactic drugs vaccines. cellular molecular 
events responsible liver stage development poorly characterized. here, we
show sporozoite, liver stage tryptophan-rich protein (sltrip) forms large
multimers. mice immunized purified recombinant sltrip protein gave high
antibody titers inbred outbred mice. immunized mice showed highly
significant levels protection upon challenge sporozoites exhibited
10,000-fold fewer parasite 18s-rrna copy numbers livers. protection 
offered immunization sltrip came mainly t-cells, antibodies 
little role play despite high titers. immunofluorescence assays showed
that sltrip expressed sporozoite early late liver stages of
malaria parasites. sltrip protein exported cytosol infected host
cells early hours parasite infection. parasites deficient sltrip
were moderately defective liver stage parasite development. transcriptome
profile sltrip-deficient parasite-infected hepatocytes highlighted sltrip
interferes multiple pathways host cell. demonstrated role
for sltrip sporozoites liver stage malaria parasites.
