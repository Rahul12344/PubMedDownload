background: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine adopted first-line
artemisinin combination therapy (act) multidrug-resistant plasmodium
falciparum malaria cambodia remaining alternatives. aimed to
assess efficacy standard 3 day dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment of
uncomplicated p falciparum malaria, without addition primaquine, 
focusing factors involved drug resistance.
methods: observational cohort study, assessed 107 adults aged 18-65
years presenting anlong veng district hospital, oddar meanchey province,
cambodia, uncomplicated p falciparum mixed p falciparum/plasmodium vivax 
infection 1000 200,000 parasites per μl blood, and
participating randomised clinical trial received
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 3 days, randomly
allocated receive either primaquine primaquine. trial halted
early due poor dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine efficacy, assessed day 42
pcr-corrected therapeutic efficacy (proportion patients recurrence 42 
days) evidence drug resistance initial cohort. analyses on
both intention treat (itt), modified itt (withdrawals, losses to
follow-up, secondary outcomes [eg, new non-recrudescent malaria
infection] censored last day follow-up), per-protocol
populations original trial. original trial registered with
clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01280162.
findings: dec 10, 2012, feb 18, 2014, enrolled 107 patients in
the original trial. enrolment voluntarily halted feb 16, 2014, before
reaching planned enrolment (n=150) poor efficacy. randomly
allocated 50 patients primaquine 51 patients primaquine groups.
pcr-adjusted kaplan-meier risk p falciparum 42 day recrudescence 54% (95% 
ci 45-63) modified itt analysis population. found two kelch13 propeller
gene mutations associated artemisinin resistance--a non-synonymous cys580tyr
substitution 70 (65%) 107 participants, arg539thr substitution 33
(31%), wild-type parasite four (4%). unlike arg539thr, cys580tyr was
accompanied two mutations associated extended parasite clearance
(mal10:688956 mal13:1718319). combination triple mutation associated
with 5·4 times greater risk treatment failure (hazard ratio 5·4 [95% ci
2·4-12]; p<0·0001) higher piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentration (triple
mutant 34 nm [28-41]; non-triple mutant 24 nm [1-27]; p=0·003) other
infections had. drug well tolerated, gastrointestinal symptoms being
the common complaints.
interpretation: dramatic decline efficacy of
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine compared observed study 
same location 2010 strongly associated new triple mutation
including kelch13 cys580tyr substitution. 3 days artemisinin part an
artemisinin combination therapy regimen might insufficient. strict regulation 
and monitoring antimalarial use, along non-pharmacological approaches 
malaria resistance containment, must integral parts public health
response rapidly accelerating drug resistance region.
