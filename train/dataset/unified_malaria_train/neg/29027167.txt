mnase-seq allows genome-wide examination nucleosome landscape by
determination nucleosome positioning occupancy. typically, native or
formaldehyde fixed chromatin subjected digestion micrococcal nuclease
(mnase), degrades linker dna yields mainly mono-nucleosomes. the
resulting material processed directly subjected optional
chromatin immunoprecipitation step (mnase-chip-seq). de-crosslinked purified 
dna subjected next-generation sequencing. protocol presented 
has tailored analysis nucleosome landscape malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, steps directly applicable 
cell types. also discuss general considerations experimental design and
computational analysis, crucial accurate investigation the
nucleosome landscape.
