endosymbiotic wolbachia bacteria potent modulators pathogen infection 
transmission multiple naturally artificially infected insect species,
including important vectors human pathogens. anopheles mosquitoes are
naturally uninfected wolbachia, stable artificial infections not
yet succeeded genus. recent techniques enabled establishment of
somatic wolbachia infections anopheles. here, characterize somatic
infections two diverse wolbachia strains (wmelpop walbb) anopheles
gambiae, major vector human malaria. infection, wmelpop disseminates
widely mosquito, infecting fat body, head, sensory organs other
tissues notably absent midgut ovaries. wolbachia initially
induces mosquito immune system, coincident initial clearing the
infection, suppresses expression immune genes, coincident with
wolbachia replication mosquito. wmelpop walbb significantly
inhibit plasmodium falciparum oocyst levels mosquito midgut. although 
virulent non-bloodfed mosquitoes, wmelpop exhibits novel phenotype is
extremely virulent approximately 12-24 hours post-bloodmeal, which
surviving mosquitoes exhibit similar mortality trajectories control
mosquitoes. data suggest stable transinfections act similar
manner somatic infections, wolbachia could potentially used part a
strategy control anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria.
