drug resistance recurrent problem fight malaria. genetic 
epidemiological surveillance antimalarial resistant parasite alleles is
crucial guide drug therapies clinical management. new antimalarial
compounds currently various stages clinical trials regulatory
evaluation. using ∼2000 plasmodium falciparum genome sequences, investigated
the genetic diversity eleven gene-targets promising antimalarial compounds 
and assessed potential efficiency across malaria endemic regions. we
determined loci selection prior introduction new drugs
and established baseline genetic variance, including potential resistant
alleles, future surveillance programmes.
