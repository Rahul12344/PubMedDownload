duffy blood group system interest several fields science including
transfusion medicine, immunology malariology. although methods been
developed duffy polymorphism genotyping, been
sufficiently described validated, present limitations. same
time, frequency duffy alleles antigens densely populated
regions world still missing. study present new tests for
genotyping major alleles duffy blood system describe duffy alleles
and antigens blood donors transfusion-dependent patients minas gerais, 
brazil. simple reproducible strategy devised duffy genotyping based
on real-time pcr included snps rs12075 rs2814778. significant
differences allele frequencies observed comparing blood donors
and patients. among blood donors, phenotype fy(a-b+) common 
and fy(a-b-) phenotype, associated populations african descent, was
remarkably less common among subjects self-identified black comparison 
to ethnoracial categories. however, african ancestry estimated by
molecular markers significantly higher individuals allele
associated duffy null phenotype. genotyping method presented may be
useful study duffy genotypes accurately different contexts populations.
the results suggest reduced risk alloimmunization duffy antigens and
increased susceptibility malaria minas gerais, considering high
frequency duffy-positive individuals.
