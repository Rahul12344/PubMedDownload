malaria human parasitic disease caused infection plasmodium species,
particularly plasmodium falciparum. year millions people infected
with malaria large numbers deaths result due deadly infection.
p. falciparum contains 14 chromosomes, nearly 5400 genes multistage life
cycle humans mosquitoes. control malaria still challenge as
the parasite continuously developing resistance available antimalarial
drugs mosquito vector developing resistance insecticides. the
availability p. falciparum genome resulted identification of
parasite-specific proteins targeted without harmful effects the
human host. toward goal, working identification and
characterization helicases order find parasite-specific helicases, which
can used novel drug targets tackle rising problem drug
resistance. helicases atp-dependent nucleic acid unwinding enzymes. the
p. falciparum genome analysis depicts contains parasite-specific
helicases homologs human helicases. here, present an
overview p. falciparum helicases importance parasite growth and
survival.
