background: simian malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi reported 
cause significant numbers human infection south east asia. merozoite
surface protein-3 (msp3) protein belongs multi-gene family of
proteins first found plasmodium falciparum. several studies evaluated the
potential p. falciparum msp3 potential vaccine candidate. however, to
date detailed studies carried p. knowlesi msp3 gene (pkmsp3).
the present study investigates genetic diversity, haplotypes groups of
pkmsp3 p. knowlesi clinical samples peninsular malaysia.
methods: blood samples collected p. knowlesi malaria patients within 
period 4 years (2008-2012). pkmsp3 gene isolates amplified via 
pcr, subsequently cloned sequenced. full length pkmsp3 sequence was
divided domain domain b. natural selection, genetic diversity, and
haplotypes pkmsp3 analysed using mega6 dnasp ver. 5.10.00 programmes.
results: 23 samples, 48 pkmsp3 sequences successfully obtained. 
nucleotide level, 101 synonymous 238 non-synonymous mutations observed. 
tests neutrality significant full length, domain domain 
b sequences. however, dn/ds ratio domain b indicates purifying selection
for domain. analysis deduced amino acid sequences revealed 42
different haplotypes. neighbour joining phylogenetic tree haplotype network
analyses revealed haplotypes clustered two distinct groups.
conclusions: moderate level genetic diversity observed pkmsp3 and
only c-terminal region (domain b) appeared purifying selection.
the separation pkmsp3 two haplotype groups provides evidence 
of existence two distinct p. knowlesi types lineages. future studies
should investigate diversity pkmsp3 among p. knowlesi isolates north
borneo, large numbers human knowlesi malaria infection still occur.
