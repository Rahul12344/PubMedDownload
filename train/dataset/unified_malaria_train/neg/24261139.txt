therapeutic efficacy sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), commonly used to
treat falciparum malaria, assessed isolates plasmodium falciparum
(welch, 1897) plasmodium vivax (grassi et feletti, 1890) ofaligarh, uttar
pradesh, north india taif, saudi arabia 2011-2012. species
showed mutations dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) enzyme common
biochemical drug targets. mutation rate pfdhfr higher compared pvdhfr 
because drug mainly given treat falciparum malaria. since the
species coexist, p. vivax also exposed sp due faulty species diagnosis 
or medication without specific diagnosis. low level mutations sp p.
falciparum saudi isolates indicates sp combination still effective
for treatment falciparum malaria. since sp used first-line of
treatment high level resistance chloroquine (cq), may
result spread higher level mutations resulting drug resistance and
treatment failure near future. therefore, avoid higher mutations in
the parasite, use better treatment regimens artesunate combination
therapy must introduced sp combination.
