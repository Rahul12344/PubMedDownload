background: isothermal amplification techniques emerging promising
method malaria diagnosis since capable detecting extremely low
concentrations parasite target mitigating need infrastructure
and training required nucleic acid based tests. recombinase polymerase
amplification (rpa) promising development since operates a
short time frame (<30 min) produces product visually detected
on lateral flow dipstick. self-sealing paper plastic system performs
both amplification detection malaria dna sequence presented.
methods: primers designed using ncbi nblast tools screened using gel
electrophoresis. paper plastic devices prototyped using commercial
design software parts cut using laser cutter assembled hand.
synthetic copies plasmodium 18s gene spiked solution used as
targets rpa reaction. test performance device same
samples spiked synthetic target run parallel paper and
plastic devices using conventional bench top methods.
results: novel rpa primers developed bind sequences present the
four species plasmodium infect humans. paper plastic devices
were found capable detecting 5 copies/Âµl synthetic
plasmodium dna (50 copies total), comparable reaction run the
bench top. devices produce visual results hour, cost approximately $1, 
and self-contained device sealed.
conclusions: device capable carrying rpa reaction and
detecting meaningful amounts synthetic plasmodium dna self-sealing and
self-contained device. device may step towards making nucleic acid
tests accessible malaria detection.
