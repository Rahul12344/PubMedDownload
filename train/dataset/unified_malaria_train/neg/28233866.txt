variable surface antigens plasmodium falciparum major research
focus since facilitate parasite sequestration give rise deadly
malaria complications. coupled potential use vaccine candidate, the
recent suggestion repetitive interspersed families polypeptides
(rifins) mediate blood group rosetting influence blood group distribution
has raised research profile adhesins. nevertheless, detailed
investigations functions highly diverse multigene family remain 
hampered limited number validated reagents. study, assess
the specificities three promising polyclonal anti-rifin antibodies were
igg-purified sera immunized animals. epitope regions mapped
using 175,000-peptide microarray holding overlapping peptides p.
falciparum variable surface antigens. immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence imaging, show different antibodies give varying
results different applications/assays. finally, authenticate the
antibody-based detection rifins two previously uncharacterized
non-rosetting parasite lines identifying dominant rif transcripts using
rna sequencing.
