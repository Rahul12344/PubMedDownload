in current era malaria eradication, reducing transmission critical.
assessment transmissibility requires tools accurately identify the
various developmental stages malaria parasite, particularly required
for transmission (sexual stages). here, present method estimating
relative amounts plasmodium falciparum asexual sexual stages gene
expression measurements. modeled using constrained linear regression to
characterize stage-specific expression profiles within mixed-stage populations.
the resulting profiles analyzed functionally gene set enrichment analysis
(gsea), confirming differentially active pathways increased mitochondrial
activity lipid metabolism sexual development. validated model
predictions microarrays quantitative rt-pcr (qrt-pcr)
measurements, based expression small set key transcriptional
markers. sufficient marker set identified backward selection the
whole genome available expression arrays, targeting one sentinel marker
per stage. model learned applied new microarray qrt-pcr
transcriptional measurement. illustrate use vitro inferring changes 
in stage distribution following stress drug treatment vivo in
identifying immature mature sexual stage carriers within patient cohorts. 
believe approach valuable resource staging lab field
samples alike wide applicability epidemiological studies of
malaria transmission.
