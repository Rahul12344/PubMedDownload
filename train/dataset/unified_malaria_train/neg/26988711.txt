considering malaria local focal disease, epidemiological understanding
of different ecotypes malaria help devising novel control measures. one
of major hurdles malaria control lies evolution dispersal of
the drug-resistant malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum. herewith present
data genetic variation single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) level in
four different genes p. falciparum (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps) that
confer resistance different antimalarials two different eco-epidemiological
settings, i.e. hilly-forest (hf) riverine-plain (rp), high malaria
endemic district odisha state, india. greater frequency antimalarial
resistance conferring snps haplotypes observed four genes p.
falciparum, pfdhps variable gene among four. significant 
genetic differentiation could observed isolates hf rp ecotypes.
twelve novel, hitherto unreported nucleotide mutations could observed the
pfmdr1 pfdhps genes. pfdhps gene presented highest haplotype
diversity, pfcrt gene displayed highest nucleotide diversity. the
data four genes complied, isolates hf ecotype found
to harbour higher average nucleotide diversity coming rp ecotype.
high positive tajima's values obtained pfcrt pfdhfr genes 
in isolates hf rp ecotypes, statistically significant
deviation neutrality rp ecotype. different patterns linkage
disequilibrium (ld) among snps located different drug-resistant genes were
found isolates collected hf rp ecotypes. whereas hf
ecotype, snps pfmdr1 pfdhfr significantly associated, rp
ecotype, snps located pfcrt associated pfmdr1, pfdhfr pfdhps.
these findings provide baseline understanding different micro
eco-epidemiological settings influence evolution spread different drug
resistance alleles. findings suggest drug resistance to
chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine approaching fixation level, which
requires urgent attention malaria control programme india.
