the role protective immunity plasmodium falciparum (pf) malaria burkitt 
lymphoma (bl) unknown. investigated association bl and
antibodies reactive se36 antigen, recombinant protein based p. falciparum
serine repeat antigen 5 gene, targeted protective malaria immune responses.
cases children (0-14 years) enrolled korle-bu teaching hospital,
accra, ghana, 1965-1994 bl confirmed histology cytology (92% of
cases). controls apparently healthy children enrolled contemporaneous the
cases nearest neighbor house case house age,-
sex-frequency-matched cases. anti-se36 igg antibodies measured using 
enzyme-linked absorbent immunoassays (elisas). se36 titers estimated by
extrapolating elisa optical density readings standard fitting curve.
anti-se36 titers log-transformed analysis. odds ratios (ors) and
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% cis) estimated using unconditional
logistic regression. mean log endpoint dilution titers 0.63 logs lower
in cases controls (8.26 [sd 1.68] vs. 8.89 [sd 1.75], student's t-test, p
= 0.019). lower titers observed cases controls aged 0-4 years (p =
0.05) aged 5-14 years (p = 0.06). low medium tertiles of
anti-se36 igg antibodies associated increased bl ([or 1.67, 95% 
ci 1.21-2.31] [or 1.33, 95% ci 0.96-1.86], respectively, p(trend) = 0.002) in
analyses adjusting age, sex, calendar period test plate. findings
suggest compared similarly aged children enrolled same
community, children bl ghana lower antibodies se36 antigen.
