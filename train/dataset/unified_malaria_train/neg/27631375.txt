malaria transmission dependent propensity anopheles mosquitoes to
bite humans (anthropophily) instead dead end hosts. recent increases 
the usage long lasting insecticide treated nets (llins) africa been
associated reductions highly anthropophilic endophilic vectors such
as anopheles gambiae s.s., leaving species broader host range, as
anopheles arabiensis, prominent remaining source transmission in
many settings. an. arabiensis appears generalist terms 
host choice resting behavior, may due phenotypic plasticity
and/or segregating allelic variation. investigate genetic basis host
choice resting behavior an. arabiensis sequenced genomes 23
human-fed 25 cattle-fed mosquitoes collected in-doors out-doors in
the kilombero valley, tanzania. identified total 4,820,851 snps, which
were used conduct first genome-wide estimates "snp heritability" for
host choice resting behavior species. genetic component was
detected host choice (human vs cow fed; permuted p = 0.002), no
evidence genetic component resting behavior (indoors versus outside;
permuted p = 0.465). principal component analysis (pca) segregated individuals 
based genomic variation three groups characterized by
differences 2rb and/or 3ra paracentromeric chromosome inversions. there
was non-random distribution cattle-fed mosquitoes pca clusters, 
suggesting alleles linked 2rb and/or 3ra inversions may influence
host choice. using novel inversion genotyping assay, detected significant 
enrichment standard arrangement (non-inverted) 3ra among cattle-fed
mosquitoes (n = 129) versus non-cattle-fed individuals (n = 234; Ï‡2, p =
0.007). thus, tracking frequency 3ra an. arabiensis populations may
be use infer selection host choice behavior within vector
populations; possibly response vector control. controlled host-choice
assays needed discern whether observed genetic component direct 
relationship innate host preference. better understanding genetic
basis host feeding behavior an. arabiensis may also open avenues novel
vector control strategies based driving genes zoophily wild mosquito 
populations.
