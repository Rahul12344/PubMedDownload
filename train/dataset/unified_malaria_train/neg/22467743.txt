thrombospondin repeat (tsr)-like domains structures involved cell
adhesion. plasmodium falciparum proteins containing tsr domains play crucial
roles parasite development. particular, preerythrocytic p. falciparum
circumsporozoite protein involved hepatocyte invasion. importance of
these domains two malaria proteins, merozoite-specific
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (mtrap) thrombospondin-related
apical membrane protein (ptramp), assessed using near-full-length
recombinant proteins composed extracellular domains produced in
escherichia coli. mtrap thought released invasive organelles
identified micronemes merozoite invasion mediate motility host
cell invasion interaction aldolase, actin binding protein
involved moving junction. ptramp function remains unknown. study, 
the conformation recombinant mtrap (rmtrap) appeared highly extended
protein (2 nm 33 nm, width length, respectively), whereas rptramp a
less extended structure. using erythrocyte binding assay, rmtrap not
rptramp bound human erythrocytes; rmtrap binding mediated tsr
domain. mtrap- general ptramp-specific antibodies failed inhibit p.
falciparum development vitro. altogether, mtrap highly extended
bifunctional protein binds erythrocyte receptor merozoite
motor.
