parasitic protozoa, malaria parasites, trypanosomes, leishmania,
acquire plethora nutrients hosts, employing transport proteins
located plasma membrane parasite. application molecular genetic 
approaches completion genome projects allowed identification 
and functional characterization cohort transporters genes in
these parasites. review focuses subset permeases have
been studied detail, import critical nutrients, provide
examples approaches undertaken broadly parasite
transporters. permeases reviewed include hexoses, purines, iron,
polyamines, carboxylates, amino acids. topics special emphasis include
structure-function approaches, critical roles transporters parasite
viability physiology, regulation transporter expression, subcellular
targeting. investigations parasite transporters impact broad spectrum of
basic biological problems protozoa.
