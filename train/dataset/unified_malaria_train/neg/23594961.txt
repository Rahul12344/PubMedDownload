sterile immunity live plasmodium infection achieved by
immunization radiation-attenuated sporozoites. protection known to
be mediated part antigen-specific memory cd8(+) cells, presumably those
residing liver. characterized compared transcriptional profile 
of parasite-specific memory cd8(+) cells residing liver spleen after
immunization mice irradiated sporozoites. microarray-based expression
analysis memory cd8(+) cells indicated liver-resident memory
cells display distinct gene expression profile. found major differences in
the expression immune function genes well genes involved cell
cycle, cell trafficking, transcription intracellular signaling. importantly, 
the malaria parasite-induced liver-resident cd8(+) cells display a
transcriptional profile different described cd8(+) cells following 
other microbial challenges.
