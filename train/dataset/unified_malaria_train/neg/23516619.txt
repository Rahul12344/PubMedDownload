diseases transmitted mosquitoes devastating impact global health and
the situation complicated due difficulties existing control
measures impact climate change. genetically modified mosquitoes that
are refractory disease transmission seen great potential 
delivery novel control strategies. streptomyces phage phic31 integrase
system successfully adapted site-directed transgene integration a
range insects, thus overcoming many limitations due size constraints and
random integration associated transposon-mediated transformation. using this
technology, previously published first site-directed transformation of
anopheles gambiae, principal vector human malaria. mosquitoes were
initially engineered incorporate phic31 docking site defined genomic 
location. second phase genetic modification achieved site-directed
integration anti-malarial effector gene. current publication we
report improved efficiency utility phic31 integrase system following
the generation anopheles gambiae self-docking strains. four independent
strains, docking sites known locations three different chromosome
arms, engineered express integrase control regulatory
regions nanos gene anopheles gambiae. resulting protein
accumulates posterior oocyte provide integrase activity site 
germline development. two self-docking strains, exhibiting significantly
different levels integrase expression, assessed site-directed
transgene integration found demonstrate greatly improved survival and
efficiency transformation. fight malaria, imperative to
establish broad repertoire anti-malarial effector genes and
tissue-specific promoters regulate expression, enabling offering
maximum effect minimum fitness cost identified. improved
technology describe facilitate comparative studies effector
transgenes, allowing informed choices made potentially lead to
transmission blockade.
