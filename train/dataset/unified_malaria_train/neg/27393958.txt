background: recombinant protein technology revolutionized world of
biology medicine. following progress, fusion protein technology, a
novel innovation, opened new horizons development proteins do
not naturally exist. fusion proteins generated via genetically fusing two 
more genes coding separate proteins, thus product single protein
having functional properties proteins. indispensable element in
fusion protein construction, linkers used separate functional domains 
in order improve expression, folding stability.
method: computationally fused antigen adjuvant together using
different linkers obtain two-domain fusion construct potentially
act oral vaccine candidate malaria. predicted the
structures computationally find probable folding domain the
designed construct.
results: one fusion constructs selected based highest value for
c-score. ramchandran plot analysis represented residues fallen 
favorable regions.
conclusion: silico analysis showed (ggggs)3 linker confers best
structure stability target fusion protein.
