microtubules cytoskeletal filaments essential many cellular processes,
including establishment maintenance polarity, intracellular transport,
division migration. metazoan cells, number length of
microtubules highly variable, precisely defined some
protozoan organisms. however, either case significance two key
parameters cells known. here, quantitatively studied impact 
modulating microtubule number length plasmodium, protozoan parasite
causing malaria. using gene deletion replacement strategy targeting one out
of two α-tubulin genes, show chromosome segregation proceeds the
oocysts even absence microtubules. however, fewer shorter
microtubules severely impaired formation, motility infectivity of
plasmodium sporozoites, forms transmitted mosquito, usually
contain 16 microtubules. found α-tubulin expression levels directly
determined number microtubules, suggesting high nucleation barrier as
supported mathematical model. infectious sporozoites formed in
parasite lines featuring least 10 microtubules, parasites 9 or
fewer microtubules failed transmit.
