introduction: east coast fever, devastating disease cattle, be
controlled partially vaccination live t. parva sporozoites. antigens 
responsible conferring immunity fully characterized. recently 
shown p. falciparum immunodominant protein ub05 highly conserved in
t. parva, causative agent east coast fever. aim present
investigation determine role homologue tpub05 protective
immunity east coast fever.
methods: cloning, sequencing expression tpub05 done according 
standard protocols. bioinformatics analysis tpub05 gene carried using 
algorithms found public domain. polyclonal antiserum recombinant
tpub05 raised rabbits used analysis western blotting, 
elisa, immunolocalization vitro infection neutralization assay. the
ability recombinant tpub05 (r-tpub05) stimulate bovine pbmcs ex-vivo to
produce ifn-γ proliferate tested using elispot [3h]-thymidine
incorporation assays, respectively.
results: 20 cattle immunised infection treatment method (itm) 
developed significantly higher levels tpub05 specific antibodies (p<0.0001)
compared non-vaccinated ones. similarly, r-tpub05 highly stimulated bovine
pmbcs 8/12 (67%) itm-immunized cattle tested produce ifn-γ and
proliferate (p< 0.029) compared 04 naїve cattle included controls.
polyclonal tpub05 antiserum raised r-tpub05 also marginally inhibited
infection (p < 0.046) bovine pbmcs t. parva sporozoites. further
experiments rt-pcr showed tpub05 gene expressed parasite. this
was confirmed immunolocalization studies revealed tpub05 expression by
schizonts piroplasms. bioinformatics analysis also revealed antigen
possesses two transmembrane domains, n-glycosylation site several
o-glycosylation sites.
conclusion: concluded tpub05 potential marker protective
immunity ecf worth investigating further.
