background: piperaquine (pq) one major components artemisinin-based 
combination therapy malaria. however, mechanism pq resistance has
remained unclear.
methods: study, infected mice pq-resistant plasmodium berghei
anka strain line (pbpqr) pq-sensitive p. berghei anka strain line (pbpqs) 
their survival rates, parasitemia, spleen sizes compared. addition,
we constructed genomic dna subtractive library spleens infected mice,
and screened potential pq-resistant related genes genomic dna pbpqr
line using representational difference analysis (rda) method. clones the
subtractive library screened pcr, related genes sequenced and
analyzed using blast software ncbi.
results: compared pbpqs-infected mice, pbpqr-infected mice survived
significantly longer, significantly lowered parasitemia rate and
significantly increased splenomegaly. among total 502 clones picked, 494
were sequenced 96 unique pcr fragments obtained; 24 dna
fragments homologous chromosomes related immune function mice. orf 
finder blasting showed protein level, 26 encoded proteins were
homologous 18 hypothetical pbanka proteins 13 encoded proteins were
homologous "ferlin-like protein" family pbanka. addition, were
more immune-related dna molecules, ubiquitous pbanka homology orf fragment
level, enriched ferlin-like protein families identified pbpqr-infected
mice pbpqs-infected mice.
conclusion: findings suggest pbpqr may induce stronger protective
immune response pbpqs infected mice.
