background: resistance malaria vectors pyrethroid insecticides been
attributed selection pressure long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins),
indoor residual spraying (irs), use chemicals agriculture. use 
of different classes insecticides combination rotation been
recommended resistance management. aim study understand
the role irs carbamate insecticide management pyrethroid
resistance.
methods: anopheles mosquitoes collected multiple sites nine
districts uganda (up five sites per district). three districts been
sprayed bendiocarb. phenotypic resistance determined using standard
susceptibility tests. molecular assays used determine frequency of
resistance mutations. kdr l1014s homozygote frequency anopheles gambiae
s.s. used outcome measure test effects various factors using
a logistic regression model. bendiocarb coverage, annual rainfall, altitude,
mosquito collection method, llin use, llins distributed previous 5 years, 
household use agricultural pesticides, malaria prevalence children
2-9 years old entered explanatory variables.
results: tests pyrethroid insecticides showed resistance suspected
resistance levels districts except apac (a sprayed district). bendiocarb
resistance detected sprayed sites, confirmed one unsprayed 
site (soroti). anopheles gambiae s.s. collected areas sprayed with
bendiocarb significantly less kdr homozygosity collected from
unsprayed areas. mosquitoes collected indoors adults significantly higher 
frequency kdr homozygotes mosquitoes collected larvae, possibly
indicating selective sampling resistant adults, presumably due exposure 
insecticides inside houses would disproportionately affect susceptible
mosquitoes. effect llin use kdr homozygosity significantly modified
by annual rainfall. areas receiving high rainfall, llin use associated
with increased kdr homozygosity association weakened rainfall
decreased, indicating frequency exposure pyrethroids relatively wet
areas high vector density.
conclusion: study suggests using carbamate insecticide irs in
areas high levels pyrethroid resistance may reduce kdr frequencies an.
