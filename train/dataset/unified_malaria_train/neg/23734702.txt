background: plasmodium knowlesi fifth species identified cause malaria 
in humans often misdiagnosed plasmodium malariae due morphological
similarities. development inexpensive, serological detection method
utilizing antibodies specific p. knowlesi would valuable tool for
diagnosis. however, identification specific antigens parasites
remains major challenge generating assays. study, surface
protein containing altered thrombospondin repeat domain (spatr) selected
as potentially specific antigen p. knowlesi. multistage expression 
sporozoites, asexual erythrocytic forms gametocytes, along possible 
role liver cell invasion, suggests spatr could used biomarker for
diagnosis p. knowlesi.
methods: spatr gene p. knowlesi codon optimized cloned
(pkhspatr). recombinant pkhspatr protein expressed, purified, evaluated
for sensitivity specificity immunoblot elisa-based assays for
detecting p. knowlesi infection.
results: recombinant pkhspatr protein allows sensitive detection human p. 
knowlesi infection serum samples immunoblot elisa.
conclusions: research, recombinant pkhspatr protein could be
exploited marker detection p. knowlesi infection humans.
therefore, finding contribute development immunodiagnostic 
assays species-specific detection malaria.
