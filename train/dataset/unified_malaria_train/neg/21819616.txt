background: plasmodium falciparum malaria remains leading cause morbidity
and mortality among african children. innate immunity provides first line 
defence p. falciparum infections, particularly young children that
lack naturally-acquired malarial immunity, population examined here. 
consistent fact elevated interleukin (il)-12 important
component innate immune response provides protective immunity against
malaria, previously shown suppression il-12 african children
is associated development severe malarial anaemia (sma). since the
role il12b variants conditioning susceptibility sma remains largely
unexplored, association single nucleotide polymorphism (1188aâ†’c,
rs3212227), sma (hb<6.0 g/dl), circulating il-12p40/p70 levels, longitudinal 
clinical outcomes kenyan children (n = 756) residing holoendemic
falciparum malaria transmission area investigated.
results: multivariate logistic regression analysis children acute malaria
(n = 544) demonstrated carriers c allele increased susceptibility
to sma (cc: or, 1.674; 95% ci, 1.006-2.673; p = 0.047, ac: or, 1.410; 95% ci,
0.953-2.087; p = 0.086) relative wild type (aa). although children sma
had lower il-12p40/p70 levels non-sma group (p = 0.037), levels 
differ significantly according genotype. longitudinal analyses entire
cohort (n = 756) failed show significant relationships rs3212227
genotypes either susceptibility sma all-cause mortality throughout 
three year follow-up.
conclusion: rs3212227 marker susceptibility sma children with
acute disease, appear mediate functional changes il-12
production longitudinal outcomes acquisition naturally-acquired 
malarial immunity.
