background: malawi experienced prolonged use sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) as
the front-line anti-malarial drug, early replacement chloroquine and
delayed introduction artemisinin-based combination therapy. extended use of
sp, continued application pregnancy impacting genomic variation
of plasmodium falciparum population.
methods: whole genome sequence data p. falciparum isolates covering 2 years of
transmission within malawi, alongside global datasets, used. than
745,000 snps identified, differences allele frequencies between
countries assessed, well genetic regions positive selection
determined.
results: positive selection signals identified within dhps, dhfr gch1,
all components parasite folate pathway associated sp resistance.
sitting predominantly dhfr triple mutation background, novel copy number
increase ~twofold identified gch1 promoter. copy number was
almost fixed (96.8% frequency) malawi samples, found less 45%
frequency african populations, distinct whole gene
duplication previously reported southeast asian parasites.
conclusions: sp resistance selection pressures retained malawian
population, known resistance dhfr mutations fixation, complemented a
novel gch1 promoter duplication. effects duplication fitness
costs sp variants resistance need elucidated.
