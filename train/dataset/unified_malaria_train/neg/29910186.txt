plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii obligate intracellular parasites 
that belong phylum apicomplexa cause major human diseases. their
access intracellular lifestyle reliant coordinated release of
proteins specialized apical organelles called micronemes rhoptries. 
a specific phosphatidic acid effector, acylated pleckstrin homology
domain-containing protein (aph) plays central role microneme exocytosis 
thus essential motility, cell entry, egress. tgaph acylated 
surface micronemes recruited phosphatidic acid (pa)-enriched
membranes. here, dissect atomic details aph pa-sensing hub its
functional interaction phospholipid membranes. unravel key
determinant pa recognition first time show aph inserts into
and clusters multiple phosphate head-groups bilayer binding surface.
