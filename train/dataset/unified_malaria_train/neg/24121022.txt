plasmodium vivax geographically widespread human malaria parasite
causing approximately 130-435 million infections annually. economic
burden many parts world poses public health challenge along 
the plasmodium sp. biology parasite less studied poorly 
understood, spite facts. emerging evidence severe complications
due infections parasite provides impetus focus research the
same. investigating parasite directly infected patients best way 
to study biology pathogenic mechanisms. gene expression studies this
parasite directly obtained patients provided evidence gene
regulation resulting varying amount transcript levels different
blood stages. mechanisms regulating gene expression malaria parasites 
not well understood. discovery natural antisense transcripts (nats) in
plasmodium falciparum suggested might play important role in
regulating gene expression. report genome-wide occurrence nats 
p. vivax parasites patients differing clinical symptoms. total of
1348 nats annotated gene loci detected using custom designed 
microarray strand specific probes. majority nats identified this
study shows positive correlation expression pattern sense (s)
transcript. data also shows condition specific expression patterns varying
s antisense (as) transcript levels. genes transcripts enrich to
various biological processes. knowledge first report the
presence nats p. vivax obtained infected patients different
disease complications. data suggests differential regulation gene
expression diverse clinical conditions, shown differing sense/antisense 
ratios would lead future detailed investigations gene regulation.
