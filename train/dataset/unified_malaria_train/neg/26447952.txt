mosquitoes anopheles (an.) aedes (ae.) genus principal vectors 
human diseases including malaria, dengue yellow fever. insecticide-based
vector control established important way preventing transmission 
such infections. currently used insecticides efficiently control mosquito
populations, growing concerns emerging resistance, off-target
toxicity ability alter ecosystems. potential target the
development insecticides reduced off-target toxicity cholinergic
enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ache). herein, report cloning, baculoviral
expression functional characterization wild-type ache genes (ace-1)
from an. gambiae ae. aegypti, including naturally occurring
insecticide-resistant (g119s) mutant an. gambiae. using enzymatic digestion
and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry found secreted
proteins post-translationally modified. michaelis-menten constants and
turnover numbers mosquito enzymes lower orthologous
aches mus musculus homo sapiens. also found g119s
substitution reduced turnover rate substrates potency selected 
covalent inhibitors. furthermore, non-covalent inhibitors less sensitive 
the g119s substitution differentiate mosquito enzymes corresponding 
vertebrate enzymes. findings indicate may possible develop
selective non-covalent inhibitors effectively target wild-type 
insecticide resistant mutants mosquito ache.
