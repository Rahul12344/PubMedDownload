heme cytotoxic plasmodium parasite, converts insoluble
crystalline form called hemozoin (malaria pigment) erythrocytes during
replication. increased serum levels free heme cause tissue damage,
activation microvascular endothelial glial cells, focal inflammation,
activation apoptotic pathways, neuronal tissue damage. several hypotheses 
have proposed explain causative factors exacerbate fatal
malaria. however, none fully explain detailed mechanisms leading to
the high morbidity mortality associated malaria. previously
reported heme-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell (hbvec) apoptosis
is major contributor severe malaria pathogenesis. here, hypothesized that
heme (at clinically relevant levels) induces inflammation apoptosis hbvec,
a process mediated independent proinflammatory proapoptotic
signaling pathways. study, determined key signaling molecules
associated heme-mediated apoptosis hbvec vitro using rt2 profiler
polymerase chain reaction array technology confirmed results using
immunostaining techniques. several expressed genes hbvec altered
upon heme stimulation, determined apoptotic effects heme were
mediated p73 (tumor protein p73). results provide opportunity to
target heme-mediated apoptosis therapeutically malaria-infected individuals.
