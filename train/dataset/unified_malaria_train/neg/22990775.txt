genetically modified plasmodium parasites central gene function reagents in
malaria research. rodent malaria genetically modified database (rmgmdb) (
www.pberghei.eu ) manually curated web - based repository contains
information genetically modified rodent malaria parasites. provides easy
and rapid access information genotype phenotype genetically
modified mutant reporter parasites. here, provide guidelines for
generating describing rodent malaria parasite mutants. standardization in
describing mutant genotypes phenotypes important enhance
publication quality also facilitate cross-linking mining data from
multiple sources, permit information derived mutant parasites 
be used integrative system biology approaches. also provide guidelines on
how submit information rmgmdb non-published mutants, mutants not
exhibit clear phenotype, well negative attempts disrupt/mutate genes. 
such information helps prevent unnecessary duplication experiments in
different laboratories, provide indirect evidence genes are
essential blood-stage development.
