objective: access new step using pcr amplify targeted mtdna sequence 
for detecting specifically plasmodium vivax co-infections, false positive
and false negative results plasmodium falciparum.
methods: study standardized new technical approach the
target mitochondrial dna sequence (mtdna) amplified using pcr technique 
as tool detect plasmodium spp. species specific primers designed to
hybridize cytochrome c oxidase gene p. vivax (cox i) p. falciparum
(cox iii). two hundred blood samples collected basis clinical
symptoms initially examined microscopic analysis after
preparing giemsa stained thick thin blood smears. afterwards genomic dna 
extracted samples subjected pcr amplification using
species specific primers amplified segments sequenced confirmation
of results.
results: one-hundred thirty-two blood samples detected positive for
malaria pcr, 64 found positive pcr 53 both
microscopy pcr p.vivax infection. nine samples found false
negative, one p.vivax mono infection declared co infection pcr 3
samples identified p.falciparum gametes confirmed p.vivax by
pcr amplification. sensitivity specificity found 85% 92%
respectively.
conclusions: results obtained pcr method comparatively better and
reliable microscopy.
