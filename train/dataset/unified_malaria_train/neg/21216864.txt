background: pathogenetic mechanisms fetal growth restriction associated
with placental malaria largely unknown. sought determine whether
placental malaria related inflammation associated disturbances in
the insulin-like growth factor (igf) axis, major regulator fetal growth.
method: measured igf-1 igf-2 concentrations plasma 88
mother-neonate pairs delivery igf binding proteins 1 3 (igfbp-1 and
igfbp-3, respectively) cord plasma cohort papua new guinean women
with without placental malaria. messenger rna levels igf-1, igf-2, the
igf receptors measured matched placental biopsy specimens.
results: compared uninfected pregnancies, igf-1 levels were
reduced 28% plasma samples women placental plasmodium falciparum 
infection associated inflammation (p = .007) 25% neonates (p 
= .002). levels fetal igfbp-1 elevated placental malaria and
without inflammation (p = .08 p = .006, respectively) compared with
uninfected controls. igf-2 igfbp-3 plasma concentrations placental igf
ligand receptor messenger rna transcript levels similar across groups.
conclusion: placental malaria-associated inflammation disturbs maternal fetal
levels igfs, regulate fetal growth. may one mechanism which
placental malaria leads fetal growth restriction.
