plasmodium parasites successfully colonize different habitats within mammals 
mosquitoes, adaptation various environments accompanied changes in
their organelle composition size. previously, observed during
hepatocyte infection, plasmodium discards organelles involved invasion and
expands implicated biosynthetic pathways. hypothesized this
process regulated autophagy. plasmodium spp. possess rudimentary set of
known autophagy-related proteins includes ortholog yeast atg8. in
this study, analyzed activity atg8-conjugation pathway the
course lifecycle plasmodium falciparum liver stage of
plasmodium berghei. engineered transgenic p. falciparum strain expressing
mcherry-pfatg8. transgenic parasites expressed mcherry-pfatg8 human
hepatocytes erythrocytes, midgut salivary glands anopheles 
mosquitoes. observed stages, mcherry-pfatg8 localized tubular
structures. em colocalization studies done p. berghei showed the
association pbatg8 limiting membranes endosymbiont-derived
plastid-like organelle known apicoplast. interestingly, parasite
replication hepatocytes, association pbatg8 apicoplast
increases organelle expands size. pbatg3, pbatg7 pbatg8 are
cotranscribed parasitic stages. molecular analysis pbatg8 pbatg3
revealed novel mechanism interaction compared observed other
orthologs. supported inability plasmodium atg8 to
functionally complement atg8Î´ yeast localize autophagosomes starved
mammalian cells. altogether, data suggests unique role the
atg8-conjugation system plasmodium parasites.
