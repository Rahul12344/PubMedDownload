recent studies indicate urbanization pronounced effect on
disease patterns developing countries. understand immunological basis
of this, examined mrna expression whole blood genes involved immune
activation regulation 151 children aged 5-13 years attending rural, urban 
low socioeconomic status (ses) urban high-ses schools ghana. samples 
also collected detect helminth malaria infections. marked differences in
gene expression observed rural urban areas well within
the urban area. expression interleukin (il)-10 programmed cell
death protein 1 increased significantly across schools urban high ses to
urban low ses rural (p-trend <0.001). although il-10 gene expression was
significantly elevated rural compared urban schools (p<0.001),
this associated parasitic infection. significant differences 
expression toll-like receptors (tlrs) signaling genes seen
between two urban schools. genetic differences could fully account for
the gene expression profiles different groups shown analysis of
il-10, tlr-2 tlr-4 gene polymorphisms. immune gene expression patterns are
strongly influenced environmental determinants may underlie effects of
urbanization seen health outcomes.
