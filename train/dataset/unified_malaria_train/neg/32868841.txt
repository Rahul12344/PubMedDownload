plasmodium invasion mosquito midguts mandatory step malaria
transmission. roles mosquito midgut proteins parasite interaction
during malaria transmission clear. study aims identify mosquito
midgut proteins interact affect p. falciparum invasion. based on
gene expression profiles protein sequences, 76 mosquito secretory proteins
that highly expressed midguts up-regulated blood meals chosen 
for analysis. 61 candidate genes successfully cloned anopheles
gambiae expressed insect cells. elisa analysis showed 25 the
insect cell-expressed recombinant mosquito proteins interacted p.
falciparum-infected cell lysates. indirect immunofluorescence assays confirmed 17
of interacted sexual stage parasites significantly stronger than
asexual stage parasites. knockdown assays found seven candidate genes
significantly changed mosquitoes' susceptibility p. falciparum. four them
(agap006268, agap002848, agap006972, agap002851) played protective function
against parasite invasion, three (agap008138, frep1, hpx15)
facilitated p. falciparum transmission mosquitoes. notably, agap008138 a
unique gene exists anopheline mosquitoes. gene products are
ideal targets block malaria transmission.
