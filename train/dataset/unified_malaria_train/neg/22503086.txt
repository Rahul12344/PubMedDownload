the mitochondrial electron transport chain essential plasmodium 
target antimalarial drug atovaquone. mitochondrial genomes of
plasmodium sp. reduced known, majority mitochondrial
proteins encoded nucleus imported mitochondrion
post-translationally. many organisms signalling pathways the
mitochondria nucleus regulate expression nuclear-encoded
mitochondrially-targeted proteins, example response mitochondrial
dysfunction. studied transcript profiles synchronous plasmodium

antimycin a, investigate whether pathways exist parasite. there
was broad perturbation gene expression. differentially expressed genes
were enriched transcripts encoding proteins involved invasion, stress
response, nucleotide biosynthesis respiration. effects attributable
to delay gene expression phase drug-treated parasites. however, our
data indicated regulation mitochondrial stress response genes genes
involved pyrimidine biosynthesis, implying existence signalling
