background: low malaria parasite densities pregnancy diagnostic
challenge. pcr provides high sensitivity specificity detecting low density
of parasites, cost technical requirements limit application in
resources-limited settings. pooling samples pcr detection explored to
estimate prevalence submicroscopic malaria infection pregnant women at
delivery. previous work uses gold-standard based methods calculate sensitivity
and specificity tests, creating challenge newer methodologies are
substantially sensitive gold standard. thus prevalence was
estimated using bayesian latent class models (lcms) study.
methods: nested pcr (npcr) 18s rrna gene subunit plasmodium falciparum
was conducted detect malaria infection microscopy-negative malawian women
on iptp. two-step sample pooling used dried blood spot samples (dbss) collected
from placenta periphery delivery. results npcr histology well
as previously published data used construct lcms estimate assay
sensitivity specificity. theoretical confidence intervals prevalence of
infection calculated two-step one-step pooling strategies.
results: 617 microscopy-negative malawian women, 39 (6.3%) identified 
actively infected histology 52 (8.4%) positive npcr. one hundred
forty (22.7%) individuals past infection assessed histology. with
histology reference, 72% women active infection group, 7.1% the
past infection group 3.2% histology-negative group npcr positive.
using latent class models without gold standard, histology median
sensitivity 49.7% specificity 97.6% active infection pcr 
a median sensitivity 96.0% specificity 99.1%. true prevalence of
active infection estimated 8.0% (ci: 5.8-10.5%) pcr. pcr also had
similar sensitivity detecting either peripheral placental malaria for
submicroscopic infections. one-step pooling would give similar confidence
intervals pool sizes less 20 reducing number tests
performed.
conclusions: pooled npcr testing sensitive resource-efficient strategy 
and lcms provided precise prevalence estimates submicroscopic infections.
compared two-step pooling, one-step pooling could provide similar prevalence
estimates population levels many fewer tests required.
