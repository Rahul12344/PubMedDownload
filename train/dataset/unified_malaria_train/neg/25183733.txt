the ability invade tissues unique characteristic malaria stages
that develop/differentiate within mosquitoes (ookinetes sporozoites). 
the hand, tissue invasion many pathogens often associated 
increased matrix metalloprotease (mmp) activity invaded tissues. by
employing cell biology reverse genetics, studied expression and
explored putative functions one three mmps encoded genome the
malaria vector anopheles gambiae, namely, anopheles gambiae mmp1 (agmmp1)
gene, processes blood digestion, midgut epithelium invasion by
plasmodium ookinetes, oocyst development. show agmmp1 exists two
alternative isoforms resulting alternative splicing; one secreted (s-mmp1)
and associated hemocytes, one membrane type (mt-mmp1) enriched the
cell attachment sites midgut epithelium. mt-mmp1 showed remarkable
response ookinete midgut invasion manifested increased expression, enhanced
zymogen maturation, subcellular redistribution, indicative an
implication midgut epithelial healing accompanies ookinete invasion. 
importantly, rna interference (rnai)-mediated silencing agmmp1 gene
revealed postinvasion protective function agmmp1 oocyst development. 
the combined results link first time mmp vector competence and
mosquito-plasmodium interactions.
