the apicomplexan moving junction (mj) highly conserved structure formed
during host cell entry anchors invading parasite host cell and
serves molecular sieve host membrane proteins protects the
parasitophorous vacuole host lysosomal destruction. recent work in
toxoplasma plasmodium reinforced composition mj an
important association rhoptry neck proteins (rons) micronemal ama1,
little known precise role rons junction are
targeted neck subcompartment. report first functional analysis a
mj/ron protein disrupting ron8 t. gondii. parasites lacking ron8 are
severely impaired attachment invasion, indicating ron8 enables
the parasite establish firm clasp host cell commit invasion.
the remaining junction components frequently drag trails behind invading
knockout parasites illustrate malformed complex without ron8.
complementation δron8 parasites restores invasion reveals processing
event ron8 c-terminus. replacement n-terminal region ron8 
mcherry reporter separates regions within ron8 necessary rhoptry
targeting complex formation required function invasion.
finally, invasion defects δron8 parasites seen vitro translate to
radically impaired virulence infected mice, promoting model ron8
has crucial unprecedented task committing toxoplasma host cell entry.
