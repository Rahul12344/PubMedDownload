chronic infection one major causes cancer, several
mechanisms infection-mediated oncogenesis. pathogens encode gene
products behave like oncogenic factors, hijacking cellular pathways to
promote survival proliferation infected cells vivo. these
viral oncoproteins trigger cellular damage defense response leading to
senescence; however, viral factors hinder suppressive effect,
suggesting cooperation viral factors important malignant
transformation. coinfection multiple agents known accelerate cancer
development certain cases. example, parasitic bacterial infection 
risk factor adult t-cell leukemia-lymphoma induced human t-cell leukemia
virus type 1, epstein-barr virus malaria closely associated with
endemic burkitt lymphoma. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is
accompanied various types infection-related cancer. findings indicate
that oncogenic pathogens cooperate overcome host barriers against
cancer development. review, authors focus collaborative
strategies pathogens oncogenesis two different points view: (i)
the cooperation two different factors encoded single pathogen;
and (ii) acceleration oncogenesis coinfection multiple agents.
