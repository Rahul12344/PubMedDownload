background: world health organization (who) recommends rapid diagnostic tests
(rdts) good alternative malaria-diagnosis method remote parts of
sub-saharan africa. majority commercial rdts currently available detect
the plasmodium falciparum protein histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2). have
also recent reports pfhrp2 gene deletions found parasites
collected several african countries. concluded lacking 
pfhrp2 gene must monitored africa. purpose study analyse 
why samples positive pcr negative rdts and, therefore,
to determine whether deletions pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes.
methods: malaria nm-pcr carried samples collected the
field. group 128 samples positive pcr negative rdt; these
samples classified rdt false-negatives. pcr carried exon2 
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes detect presence absence two genes.
frequencies 95% confidence intervals (cis) used prevalence
estimates. associations assessed chi square test fisher´s exact
test. level significance set p ≤ 0.05. statistical analyses were
performed using software package spssv.15.0.
results: pcr, 81 samples identified (4.7%, 95% ci 3.8-5.8) had
deletion genes, pfhrp2 pfhrp3. overall, however, 11 samples (0.6%,
95% ci 0.36-1.14) deletion pfhrp2 pfhrp3, 15 (0.9%,
95% ci 0.6-1.5) presented deletion pfhrp3 pfhrp2.
considering pfhrp2 gene separately, within total 1724 samples, 92
(5.3%, 95% ci 4.37-6.5) evidence deletion.
conclusion: present study provides first evidence deletion the
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes p. falciparum isolates equatorial guinea.
however, larger studies across different regions within country across
different seasonal profiles needed determine full extent pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 deletion. strongly recommended implement active surveillance
programme order detect increases pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletion
frequencies.
