increasing antimalarial drug resistance threatens effective
antimalarial drug treatment, malaria control, elimination. artemisinin
combination therapies (acts) first-line treatment uncomplicated
falciparum malaria endemic countries, yet partial resistance to
artemisinins emerged greater mekong subregion. concomitant emergence
of partner drug resistance causing high act treatment failure rates in
several areas. genetic markers artemisinin resistance several the
partner drugs established, greatly facilitating surveillance. single
point mutations gene coding kelch propeller domain k13
protein strongly correlate artemisinin resistance. novel regimens and
strategies using existing antimalarial drugs needed novel compounds
can deployed. elimination artemisinin resistance imply elimination 
all falciparum malaria areas. vivax malaria, chloroquine
resistance increasing problem.
