inhibitors cellular protein kinases reported inhibit the
development apicomplexan parasites, suggesting functions protozoan
protein kinases critical life cycle. however, specific roles of
these protein kinases cannot determined using inhibitors without
molecular analysis, including gene disruption. report, describe the
functions apicomplexan protein kinases parasite life stage the
potential pre-existing protein kinase inhibitors apicomplexan drugs
against, mainly, plasmodium toxoplasma.
