the deadliest form human malaria primarily caused protozoan parasite
plasmodium falciparum. parasites establish pathogenicity human host 
with low number sexual forms gametocytes, transmitted to
the mosquitoes. several studies reported exposing artemisinin-sensitive
p. falciparum rings low concentration dihydroartemisinin (dha) results in
dormancy, artemisinin-induced dormant (aid) forms recovered into
normal growth stages 5-20 days. study, artemisinin-resistant p.
falciparum parasites tested development aid forms their
recovery. interestingly, found exposure asynchronous culture of
artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum ipc 5202 dha, line carrying mutation
in pfk13 gene linked artemisinin resistance, also results in
dormancy. ring late stages aid forms recovered after
10-15 days. furthermore, high proportion recovered dormant forms
developed sexual forms gametocytes 3-4 weeks, almost 7-8
times higher rate conversion asexual sexual forms (gametocytes) the
malaria transmissible forms. contrast, early ring forms of
artemisinin-sensitive parasites recovered slowly, additional exposure of
these parasites artemisinin resulted complete clearance within week. this
is contrast resistant parasites exposed second dose of
artemisinin, resulted high rate dormancy recovery into
sexual forms gametocytes.
