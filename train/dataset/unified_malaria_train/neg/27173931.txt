protozoan parasites colonize numerous metazoan hosts insect vectors through
their life cycles, need respond quickly reversibly while
encountering diverse often hostile ecological niches. succeed, parasites
must also persist within individuals transmission hosts is
achieved. several parasitic protozoa cause huge burden disease humans and
livestock, focus parasites cause malaria african
trypanosomiasis. efforts understand pathogens adapt survive in
varied host environments, cause disease, transmit hosts revealed
a wealth epigenetic phenomena. epigenetic switching mechanisms appear be
ideally suited regulation clonal antigenic variation underlying
successful parasitism. review molecular players complex mechanistic
layers mediate epigenetic regulation virulence gene expression.
understanding epigenetic processes aid development antiparasitic
therapeutics.
