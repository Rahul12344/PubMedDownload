plasmodium falciparum mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases, family of
enzymes central signal transduction processes including inflammatory
responses, promising target antimalarial drug development. study
shows first time p. falciparum specific map kinase 2 (pfmap2) is
colocalized nucleus asexual erythrocytic stages p.
falciparum particularly elevated phosphorylated form. also
discovered pfmap2 expressed highest quantity early
trophozoite (ring form) stage significantly reduced mature trophozoite
and schizont stages. although phosphorylated form kinase always
more prevalent, ratio relative nonphosphorylated form remained
constant irrespective parasites' developmental stage. also shown
that tsh motif specifically renders pfmap2 genetically divergent the
other plasmodial map kinase activation sites using neighbour joining analysis.
furthermore, tsh motif-specific designed antibody crucial determining the
location expression pfmap2 protein. however, using
immunoelectron microscopy, ppfmap2 detected ubiquitously parasitized 
erythrocytes. summary, pfmap2 may play far important role than
previously thought worthy candidate research antimalarial.
