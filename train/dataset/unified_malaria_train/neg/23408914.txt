malaria parasites elude eradication attempts within human host and
across nations. individual level, parasites evade host immune
responses antigenic variation. global level, parasites escape drug
pressure single nucleotide variants gene copy amplification events
conferring drug resistance. despite importance global health, rates 
at genomic alterations emerge determined. studied
the complete genomes different plasmodium falciparum clones been
propagated asexually one year presence absence drug pressure. 
a combination whole-genome microarray analysis next-generation deep
resequencing (totaling 14 terabases) revealed stable core genome 38
novel single nucleotide variants appearing seventeen evolved clones (avg. 5.4 
per clone). clones exposed atovaquone, found cytochrome b mutations as
well amplification event encompassing p. falciparum multidrug
resistance associated protein (mrp1) chromosome 1. observed 18 large-scale 
(>1 kb average) deletions telomere-proximal regions encoding multigene
families, involved immune evasion (9.5×10(-6) structural variants per base
pair per generation). six deletions associated chromosomal
crossovers generated mitosis. found minor differences rates
between genetically distinct strains parasites cultured the
presence absence drug. using derived mutation rates p. falciparum
(1.0-9.7×10(-9) mutations per base pair per generation), model the
frequency drug immune resistance alleles emerge a
well-defined set assumptions. further, detection mitotic recombination 
events var gene families illustrates multigene families arise and
change time p. falciparum. results help improve our
understanding p. falciparum evolves evade control efforts within both
the individual hosts large populations.
