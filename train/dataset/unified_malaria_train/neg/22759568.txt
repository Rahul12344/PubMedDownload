background: microarrays widely used investigate blood stage of
plasmodium falciparum infection. starting synchronized cells, gene
expression levels continually measured 48-hour intra-erythrocytic
cycle (idc). however, cell population gradually loses synchrony the
experiment. result, microarray measurements blurred. paper, 
we propose generalized deconvolution approach reconstruct intrinsic
expression pattern, apply p. falciparum idc microarray data.
methods: develop statistical model decay synchrony among cells,
and reconstruct expression pattern statistical inference. the
proposed method handle microarray measurements noise missing data.
the original gene expression patterns become apparent reconstructed
profiles, making easier analyze interpret data. hypothesize that
reconstructed gene expression patterns represent better temporally resolved
expression profiles probabilistically modeled match changes in
expression level idc transitions. particular, identify transcriptionally
regulated protein kinases putatively involved regulating p. falciparum
idc.
results: analyzing publicly available microarray data sets p.
falciparum idc, protein kinases ranked terms likelihood be
involved regulating transitions ring, trophozoite schizont
developmental stages p. falciparum idc. theoretical framework, a
few protein kinases high probability rankings, could potentially be
involved regulating developmental transitions.
conclusions: study proposes new methodology extracting intrinsic
expression patterns microarray data. applying method p.
falciparum microarray data, several protein kinases predicted play a
significant role p. falciparum idc. earlier experiments indeed
confirmed several kinases involved process. overall,
these results indicate functional analysis additional
putative protein kinases may reveal new insights p. falciparum idc
is regulated.
