the malaria parasite develops sexually mosquito midgut upon entry the
ingested blood meal invade midgut epithelium embark on
sporogony. recent data identified number distinct transcriptional
programmes operating critical phase parasite life cycle. we
aimed characterizing parental contribution transcriptional
programmes establish genetic framework would guide studies
of plasmodium zygotic development ookinete-to-oocyst transition. achieve
this used vitro vivo cross-fertilization experiments various
parasite lines expressing fluorescent reporters control constitutive
and stage-specific promoters. results revealed zygote/ookinete stage
exhibits maternal phenotype respect constitutively expressed reporters,
which derived either maternal mrna inheritance transcription the
maternal allele. respective paternal alleles silenced the
zygote/ookinete reactivated midgut invasion transformation to
oocyst. transcripts specifically produced zygote/ookinete synthesized 
de novo parental alleles. findings highlight putative role of
epigenetic regulation plasmodium zygotic development add substantially 
the emerging picture molecular mechanisms regulating important stage 
of malaria transmission.
