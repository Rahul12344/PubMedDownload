there unmet need improved therapeutics colorectal cancer, the
second leading cause cancer mortality worldwide. adjuvant chemotherapy only
marginally improves survival patients benefit others,
underscoring clinical opportunity novel immunotherapeutic approaches to
improve survival colorectal cancer. context, guanylate cyclase c
(gucy2c) established biomarker therapeutic target metastatic
colorectal cancer immunological characteristics promote durable
antitumor efficacy without autoimmunity. preliminary studies established
non-replicating human type 5 adenovirus (ad5) expressing gucy2c safe and
effective induce gucy2c-specific immune responses antitumor immunity in
mice. study characterized biodistribution, immunogenicity, safety of
a vector expressing gucy2c fused human cd4+ helper cell epitope padre 
(ad5-gucy2c-padre) advance vaccine clinical trials colorectal
cancer patients. ad5-gucy2c-padre levels highest injection site and
distributed vivo primarily draining lymph nodes, liver, spleen and,
unexpectedly, bone marrow. immune responses following ad5-gucy2c-padre
administration characterized padre-specific cd4+ t-cell and
gucy2c-specific b-cell cd8+ t-cell responses, producing antitumor immunity
targeting gucy2c-expressing colorectal cancer metastases lungs, without
acute chronic autoimmune toxicities. collectively, data support
ad5-gucy2c-padre safe effective vaccination strategy preclinical
models position ad5-gucy2c-padre phase clinical testing colorectal
cancer patients.
