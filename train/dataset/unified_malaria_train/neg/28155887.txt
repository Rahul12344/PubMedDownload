the influence parasite genetic factors immune responses development 
severe pathology malaria largely unknown. study, performed
genome-wide transcriptomic profiling mouse whole blood blood-stage
infections two strains rodent malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi that
differ virulence. identified several transcriptomic signatures associated
with virulent infection, including signatures platelet aggregation,
stronger prolonged anemia lung inflammation. first two signatures
were detected prior pathology. anemia signature indicated deregulation 
host erythropoiesis, lung inflammation signature linked increased 
neutrophil infiltration, cell death greater parasite sequestration in
the lungs. comparative whole-blood transcriptomics profiling virulent and
avirulent malaria shows validity approach inform severity the
infection provide insight pathogenic mechanisms.
