malaria vector-borne infectious disease considered priority the
world health organization due enormous impacts global health.
plasmodium spp. (haemosporida: plasmodiidae), anopheles spp. (diptera:
culicidae), suitable host key elements malaria transmission. to
disrupt parasitic life cycle malaria prevent transmission, these
three key elements targeted effective control strategies.
development vaccines interrupt malaria transmission one the
solutions recommended countries aim eliminate
malaria. respect important role anopheles stephensi malaria
transmission involvement anopheles carboxypeptidase b1 sexual parasite 
development, characterized second member cpb gene family (cpbas2) of
an. stephensi provide basic information evaluate significance of
cpbas2's role complementing sexual plasmodium development role cpbas1. 
cpbas2 mrna sequence characterized 3' 5' race structural
features coded protein studied silico modeling. coding
sequence gene structure cpbas2 determined empirically compared
with silico predictions an. stephensi genome sequencing project. 
furthermore, homology modeling revealed structure similar the
structurally important domains procarboxypeptidase b2 humans. study
provides basic molecular structural information another member the
cpb gene family an. stephensi. reported results informative and
necessary evaluation role gene sexual parasite development 
by future studies.
