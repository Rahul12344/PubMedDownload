eukaryotic parasites genus plasmodium cause malaria invading and
developing within host erythrocytes. here, demonstrate pfshelph2, gene 
product plasmodium falciparum belongs shewanella-like phosphatase 
(shelph) subfamily, selectively hydrolyzes phosphotyrosine, shown other
previously studied shelph family members. extracellular merozoite stage,
pfshelph2 localizes vesicles appear distinct rhoptry,
dense granule, microneme organelles. invasion, pfshelph2 released
from vesicles exported host erythrocyte. vitro, pfshelph2
shows tyrosine phosphatase activity host erythrocyte protein band 3, 
which abundant tyrosine-phosphorylated species erythrocyte.
during p. falciparum invasion, band 3 undergoes dynamic rapid clearance 
the invasion junction within 1 2 parasite attachment erythrocyte. 
release pfshelph2 occurs clearance band 3 parasite-host cell
interface parasite nearly completely enclosed nascent
vacuole. propose model phosphatase modifies band 3 time to
restore interaction cytoskeleton thus reestablishes the
erythrocyte cytoskeletal network end invasion process.
