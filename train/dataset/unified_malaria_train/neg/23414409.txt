since first effort recombinantly express hepatitis b core protein
(hbc) bacteria, remarkable virion-like structure fuelled interest in
unraveling structural antigenic properties protein. initial
studies proved hbc virus-like particles possess strong immunogenic properties,
which conveyed linked antigens. 35Â years later, numerous
studies performed using hbc carrier protein antigens derived
from dozen different pathogens diseases. review, authors
highlight intriguing features hbc carrier antigen, illustrated by
some examples experimental results underscore value hbc an
antigen-presenting platform. two hbc fusions, targeting influenza 
malaria, even progressed clinical testing. future, hbc-based
virus-like particles platform probably continue used display
of poorly immunogenic antigens, mainly virus-like particle formation by
hbc capsomers compatible nearly available recombinant gene expression
system.
