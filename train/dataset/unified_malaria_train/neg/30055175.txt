in southeast asia, anopheles lesteri (recently synonymized an. paraliae) 
a competent vector plasmodium parasites, ability transmit
parasites cause lymphatic filariasis yet determined. this
study, susceptibility an. lesteri an. paraliae brugia malayi
parasites determined comparing control mosquito, aedes togoi. 
found infection prevalence per infected mosquito an. paraliae was
significantly lower ae. togoi experiments (p <  0.05).
reciprocal crosses (female an. paraliae x male an. lesteri) produced highly
susceptible f1-hybrid progeny, increased infection prevalence compared 
to parental stocks (p <  0.05). subsequently, possibilities introgression 
between high low/moderate parasite susceptibility genes investigated 
cross-mating experiments (parental, reciprocal crosses, back crosses repeated
backcrosses). results showed possibility introgression b.
malayi-susceptible genes an. paraliae (low/moderate susceptibility) and
an. lesteri (high susceptibility) based increasing decreasing
susceptibility normal larval development thoracic muscles of
f3-hybrids. additionally, melanization, innate immune response proven
involvement susceptibility refractoriness mosquitoes b. malayi
parasites, examined. parasite degeneration cell aggregation, and
melanization observed first-stage larvae thoracic muscle fibers
of hybrid mosquitoes.
