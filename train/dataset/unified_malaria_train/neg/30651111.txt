background: plasmodium falciparum infections slow parasite clearance
following artemisinin-based therapies widespread greater mekong
subregion. molecular marker slow clearance phenotype been
identified: single genetic changes within propeller region kelch13
protein (pfk13; pf3d7_1343700). global searches identified almost 200
different non-synonymous mutant pfk13 genotypes. mutations occur low
prevalence uncertain functional significance. characterize impact
of different pfk13 mutations parasite clearance, conducted individual
patient data meta-analysis associations parasite clearance
half-life (pc1/2) pfk13 genotype based large set individual patient
records asia africa.
methods: systematic literature review following prisma protocol was
conducted identify studies published 2000 2017 included
frequent parasite counts pfk13 genotyping. four databases (ovid medline,
pubmed, ovid embase, web science core collection) searched. eighteen 
studies (15 asia, 2 africa, one multicenter study sites on
both continents) met inclusion criteria shared. associations the
log transformed pc1/2 values pfk13 genotype assessed using multivariable
regression models random effects study site.
results: pfk13 genotypes pc1/2 available 3250 (95%)
patients (n = 3012 asia (93%), n = 238 africa (7%)). among asian
isolates, pfk13 propeller region mutant alleles observed five more
specific isolates associated 1.5- 2.7-fold longer geometric mean
pc1/2 compared pc1/2 wild type isolates (all p ≤ 0.002). addition,
mutant allele e252q located p. falciparum region pfk13 associated
with 1.5-fold (95%ci 1.4-1.6) longer pc1/2. none isolates four
countries africa showed significant difference pc1/2 of
parasites without pfk13 propeller region mutations. previously, the
association six pfk13 propeller mutant alleles delayed parasite clearance
had confirmed. analysis demonstrates 15 additional pfk13 alleles
are associated strongly slow-clearing phenotype southeast asia.
conclusion: pooled analysis associated 20 pfk13 propeller region mutant alleles
with slow clearance phenotype, including 15 mutations confirmed
previously.
