background: control elimination malaria accelerated by
transmission-blocking interventions vaccines. surface antigen of
plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, pfs230, leading vaccine target antigen,
and recently progressed experimental clinical trials. support vaccine
product development, n-terminal pfs230 antigen designed increase yield,
as well improve antigen quality, integrity, homogeneity.
methods: scalable baculovirus expression system used express the
pfs230d1+ construct (aa 552-731), subsequently purified analysed.
pfs230d1+ designed avoid glycosylation protease digestion, thereby
potentially increasing homogeneity stability. resulting pfs230d1+ protein
was compared previous iteration pfs230 n-terminal domain, pfs230c1
(aa 443-731), physiochemical characterization vivo analysis. the
induction functional antibody responses confirmed via standard
membrane feeding assay (smfa).
results: pfs230d1+ produced purified overall yield 23 mg/l
culture supernatant, twofold yield increase pfs230c1. pfs230d1+
protein migrated single band via sds-page detected anti-pfs230c1 
monoclonal antibodies. evaluation sds-page, chromatography (size-exclusion and
reversed phase) capillary isoelectric focusing demonstrated molecule 
improved homogeneity terms size, conformation, charge. intact mass
spectrometry confirmed molecular weight free of
glycosylation, key difference prior pfs230c1 protein. correct
formation two intramolecular disulfide bonds initially inferred by
binding conformation specific monoclonal antibody directly confirmed 
lc/ms peptide mapping. injected mice pfs230d1+ protein elicited
antibodies demonstrated transmission-reducing activity, via smfa, comparable
to pfs230c1.
conclusion: elimination o-glycosylation site, potential
n-glycosylation site, two proteolytic cleavage sites, improved n-terminal 
pfs230 fragment produced, termed d1+, non-glycosylated, homogeneous,
and biologically active. intact protein higher yield previously
observed pfs230c1 fragment achieved. results indicate that
pfs230d1+ protein produced baculovirus expression system attractive 
antigen transmission-blocking vaccine development.
