the invasion pest insects often changes destroys native ecosystem, and
can result food shortages disease endemics. issues the
environmental effects chemical control methods, economic burden of
maintaining control strategies risk pest resistance still remain, 
mosquito-borne diseases malaria dengue fever prevail many
countries, infecting 100 million worldwide 2010. one environmentally
friendly method mosquito control sterile insect technique (sit). 
species-specific method insect control relies mass rearing,
sterilization release large numbers sterile insects. alternative
transgenic method release insects carrying dominant lethal (ridl).
our objective consider contrasting control strategies two invasive
scenarios via sit ridl: endemic case emerging outbreak. we
investigate release rate size release region influence the
potential control success resources needed achieve it, a
range conditions control strategies, discuss advantageous
strategies respect reducing release resources strategy costs (in 
terms control mosquito numbers) required achieve complete eradication of
wild-type mosquitoes.
