background: highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods offer an
alternative light microscopy examination mosquito salivary glands for
the determination malaria sporozoite rates wild caught female anopheles.
removal mosquito abdomens assumed eliminate false positives caused by
malaria oocyst dna midgut. assumption tested with
current gold standard pcr assays, variety conditions that
specimens could encounter laboratory field.
methods: laboratory anopheles stephensi used infected with
plasmodium falciparum 6-7 days 14 days post infection (p.i.), oocysts
only oocysts + sporozoites, respectively, developed. mosquitoes were
killed immediately frozen, air dried frozen, stored under
humid conditions overnight frozen, simulate range conditions
in field. additionally, abdomens removed anterior to, at, posterior
to junction abdomen thorax, portions processed using
a standard nested pcr small sub-unit nuclear ribosomal genes (ssrdna) with
products visualized agarose gels.
results: overall, 4.1 % (4/97) head + thorax samples 6-7 days p.i.
gave apparent false positives sporozoites, compared 9.3 % (9/97) were
positive abdomens. positives (0/52) obtained similar specimens
were bisected anterior junction thorax abdomen, compared to
21.2 % (11/52) positive posterior portions. multiple bands were
noted positives 'frozen' treatment rate false negatives
due dna degradation appears higher 'humid' treatment.
reproducibility results 'frozen' treatment 90 %.
conclusions: despite importance specimen condition bisection step 
in determining sporozoite rates, little attention paid the
literature. recommendations study that: 1) care needs taken
to reduce dna degradation field; 2) mosquito abdomens separated
anterior junction thorax abdomen; 3) dna sequencing a
subsample positive results undertaken possible.
