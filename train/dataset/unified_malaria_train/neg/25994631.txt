the use insecticide-treated nets indoor residual insecticides targeting
adult mosquito vectors key element malaria control programs. however,
mosquito resistance insecticides used applications threatens
malaria control efforts. recently, mass drug administration ivermectin
(ivm) shown kill anopheles gambiae mosquitoes disrupt plasmodium 
falciparum transmission field. cloned molecular target ivm 
a. gambiae, glutamate-gated chloride channel (agglucl), characterized its
transcriptional patterns, protein expression functional responses to
glutamate ivm. agglucl cloning revealed unpredicted fourth splice isoform 
as well novel exon splice site. predicted gene products contained
heterogeneity n-terminal extracellular domain intracellular loop
region. responses glutamate ivm measured using two-electrode voltage 
clamp xenopus laevis oocytes expressing agglucl. ivm induced non-persistent
currents agglucl-a1 potentiate glutamate responses. contrast,
agglucl-b insensitive ivm, suggesting agglucl gene could produce 
ivm-sensitive -insensitive homomultimers alternative splicing. agglucl
isoform-specific transcripts measured across tissues, ages, blood feeding
status sex, found differentially transcribed across these
physiological variables. lastly, stained adult, female a. gambiae glucl
expression. channel expressed antenna, johnston's organ,
supraesophageal ganglion thoracic ganglia. summary, characterized 
the first glucl mosquito, a. gambiae, described unique activity
and expression respect target insecticide ivm.
