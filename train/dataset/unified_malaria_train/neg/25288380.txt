background: intensified efforts urgently needed contain eliminate
artemisinin-resistant plasmodium falciparum greater mekong subregion.
médecins sans frontières plans support ministry health eliminating
p. falciparum area artemisinin resistance north-east of
cambodia. first step, prevalence plasmodium spp. presence 
mutations associated artemisinin resistance evaluated two districts 
of preah vihear province.
methods: cross-sectional population-based study using two-stage cluster
sampling conducted rural districts chhaeb chey saen, from
september october 2013. district, 30 clusters 10 households were
randomly selected. total, blood samples collected 1,275 participants 
in chhaeb 1,224 chey saen. prevalence plasmodium spp. assessed by
pcr dried blood spots. plasmodium falciparum positive samples screened
for mutations k13-propeller domain gene (pf3d7_1343700).
result: prevalence plasmodium spp. estimated 1.49% (95% ci
0.71-3.11%) chhaeb 2.61% (95% ci 1.45-4.66%) chey saen. twenty-seven
samples positive p. falciparum, giving prevalence 0.16% (95% ci
0.04-0.65) chhaeb 2.04% (95% ci 1.04-3.99%) chey saen. 4.0% the
participants testing positive presented fever history fever.
k13-propeller domain mutant type alleles (c580y y493h) found, in
chey saen district, seven 11 p. falciparum positive samples enough
genetic material allow testing.
conclusion: overall prevalence p. falciparum low districts but
parasites presenting mutations k13-propeller domain gene, strongly
associated artemisinin-resistance, circulating chey saen.the
prevalence might underestimated absentees - mainly forest
workers - workers private companies included the
study. results confirm need urgently develop implement targeted 
interventions contain eliminate p. falciparum malaria district
before spreads areas.
