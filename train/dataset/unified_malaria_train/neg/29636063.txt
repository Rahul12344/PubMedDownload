background: human cerebral malaria (hcm) severe form malaria
characterized sequestration infected erythrocytes (irbcs) brain
microvessels, increased levels circulating free heme pro-inflammatory
cytokines chemokines, brain swelling, vascular dysfunction, coma, and
increased mortality. neuregulin-1β (nrg-1) encoded gene nrg1, member 
of family polypeptide growth factors required normal development 
nervous system heart. utilizing experimental cerebral malaria (ecm)
model (plasmodium berghei anka c57bl/6), reported nrg-1 played a
cytoprotective role ecm circulating levels inversely correlated 
with ecm severity. intravenous infusion nrg-1 reduced ecm mortality mice by
promoting robust anti-inflammatory response coupled reduction in
accumulation irbcs microvessels reduced tissue damage.
methods: current study, examined nrg-1 treatment attenuates
pathogenesis mortality associated ecm. examined whether nrg-1
protects cxcl10- heme-induced apoptosis using human brain
microvascular endothelial (hcmec/d3) cells m059k neuroglial cells. hcmec/d3
cells grown monolayer co-culture system 30 μm heme nrg-1
(100 ng/ml) used examine role nrg-1 blood brain barrier (bbb)
integrity. using vivo ecm model, examined whether reduction of
mortality associated activation erbb4 akt inactivation of
stat3 signaling pathways. data analysis, unpaired test one-way anova
with dunnett's bonferroni's post test applied.
results: determined that nrg-1 protects cell death/apoptosis human 
brain microvascular endothelial cells neroglial cells, two major
components bbb. nrg-1 treatment improved heme-induced disruption in
vitro bbb model consisting hcmec/d3 human m059k cells. ecm murine
model, nrg-1 treatment stimulated erbb4 phosphorylation (perbb4) followed by
activation akt inactivation stat3, attenuated ecm mortality.
conclusions: results indicate potential pathway nrg-1 treatment
maintains bbb integrity vitro, attenuates ecm-induced tissue injury, and
reduces mortality. furthermore, postulate augmenting nrg-1 ecm
therapy may effective adjunctive therapy reduce cns tissue injury and
potentially increase effectiveness current anti-malaria therapy against
human cerebral malaria (hcm).
