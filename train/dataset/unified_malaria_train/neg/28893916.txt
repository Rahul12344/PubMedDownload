epidemiological observations linked increased host iron malaria
susceptibility, perturbed iron handling hypothesized contribute
to potentially life-threatening anemia may accompany blood-stage malaria
infection. improve understanding relationships, examined the
pathways involved regulation master controller iron metabolism, 
hormone hepcidin, malaria infection. show hepcidin upregulation in
plasmodium berghei murine malaria infection accompanied changes in
expression bone morphogenetic protein (bmp)/sons mothers against
decapentaplegic (smad) pathway target genes, key pathway involved hepcidin
regulation. therefore investigated known agonists bmp/smad pathway 
found bmp gene expression increased infection. contrast,
activin b, signal bmp/smad pathway associated 
with increased hepcidin inflammation, upregulated livers of
plasmodium berghei-infected mice; hepatic activin b also upregulated peak 
parasitemia infection plasmodium chabaudi concentrations the
closely related protein activin increased parallel hepcidin serum
from malaria-naive volunteers infected controlled human malaria infection
(chmi) clinical trials. however, antibody-mediated neutralization activin
activity murine malaria infection affect hepcidin expression,
suggesting proteins stimulate hepcidin upregulation directly.
in conclusion, present evidence bmp/smad signaling pathway is
perturbed malaria infection activins, although raised malaria
infection, may critical role hepcidin upregulation setting.
