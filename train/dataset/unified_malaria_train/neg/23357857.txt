although great efforts undertaken development malaria
vaccines, completely effective malaria vaccines available yet. despite
being clinically silent, pre-erythrocytic stage considered ideal target
for development malaria vaccines. sporozoite asparagine-rich protein 1
(sap1) sporozoite-localized protein regulates expression uis
(upregulated infectious sporozoites) genes, essential the
infectivity sporozoites. study, recombinant dna vaccine encoding a
predicted antigenic determinant region plasmodium yoelii sap1 (pysap1) was
constructed. immunization mice dna vaccine construct resulted in
significant elevation cytokines ifn-Î³, il-2, il-4 il-10, total
igg compared control groups immunized either empty dna vector or
saline. challenge sporozoites, group receiving dna vaccine
showed delayed development parasitemia prolonged survival time compared
with control group. dna vaccine provided partial protection p.
yoelii 17xl infection, overall protection rate 20%. addition, the
dna vaccine show integration host genome. studies of
sap1 needed test whether used subunit vaccine candidate.
