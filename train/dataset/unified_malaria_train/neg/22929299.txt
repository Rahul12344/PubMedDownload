plasmodium falciparum, causative agent deadliest form malaria, 
human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) among important health
problems worldwide, responsible total 4 million deaths annually.
due extensive overlap developing regions, especially sub-saharan
africa, co-infections malaria hiv-1 common, interplay
between two diseases poorly understood. epidemiological reports have
suggested malarial infection transiently enhances hiv-1 replication and
increases hiv-1 viral load co-infected individuals. viremia stays
high several weeks treatment antimalarials, phenomenon could 
have impact disease progression transmission. cellular
immunological mechanisms behind observations studied only
scarcely. vitro studies investigating impact malaria hiv-1
have demonstrated exposure soluble malarial antigens increase hiv-1
infection reactivation immune cells. however, studies used whole
cell extracts p. falciparum schizont stage parasites peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc), making hard decipher malarial component(s) 
was responsible observed effects target host cells were.
recent work demonstrated exposure immature monocyte-derived dendritic
cells malarial pigment hemozoin increased ability transfer hiv-1 
to cd4+ cells, decreased hiv-1 infection macrophages(8). shed
light complex process, systematic analysis interactions 
the malaria parasite hiv-1 different relevant human primary cell
populations critically needed. several techniques investigating impact
of hiv-1 phagocytosis micro-organisms effect pathogens 
on hiv-1 replication described. present method investigate
the effects p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes replication hiv-1 in
human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. impact parasite exposure on
hiv-1 transcriptional/translational events monitored using single cycle
pseudotyped viruses luciferase reporter gene replaced env gene
while effect quantity virus released infected macrophages is
determined measuring hiv-1 capsid protein p24 elisa cell
supernatants.
