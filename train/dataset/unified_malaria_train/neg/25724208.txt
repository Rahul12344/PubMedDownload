epigenetic control gene expression important implications the
regulation developmental processes, mediating homeostasis responses to
the external environment, transgenerational inheritance gene
expression patterns. genes mediate epigenetic control been
well-characterized drosophila melanogaster, identified and
analyzed orthologous gene ensemble anopheles gambiae comprises 169
orthologs related 215-member epigenetic gene ensemble d. melanogaster. we
find ensemble highly conserved among anopheline mosquitoes, we
identify seven gene family expansion/contraction events within ensemble 
among 12 mosquito species studied within genus anopheles. comparative
analyses epigenetic gene expression across genera drosophila and
anopheles reveal distinct tissue-associated expression patterns two
genera, similar temporal expression patterns. a. gambiae complex d.
melanogaster subgroup epigenetic gene ensembles exhibit similar evolutionary
rates, assessed respective dn/ds values. differences in
tissue-associated expression patterns, contrast similarities in
evolutionary rates temporal expression patterns, may imply members 
of epigenetic gene ensemble redeployed within one genera,
in comparison recent common ancestor two clades. members 
this epigenetic gene ensemble may constitute another set potential targets for
vector control enable reductions burden human malaria, by
analogy recent success development small molecule antagonists for
mammalian epigenetic machinery.
