nearly one million deaths attributed malaria every year. recent reports of
multi-drug treatment failure falciparum malaria underscore need to
understand molecular basis drug resistance. multiple mutations the
plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) involved 
chloroquine resistance, evolution complex haplotypes yet well
understood. using 4,500 archival human serum specimens collected 19
pacific populations 1959 1979, period including prior to
the appearance chloroquine treatment failure pacific, pcr-amplified 
and sequenced portion pfcrt exon 2 771 p. falciparum-infected
individuals explore spatial temporal variation falciparum malaria
prevalence evolution chloroquine resistance. pacific, the
prevalence p. falciparum varied considerably across ecological zones. the
island new guinea, decreases prevalence p. falciparum coastal,
high-transmission areas time contrasted increase prevalence
during period highlands, transmission intermittent. 
found 78 unique pfcrt haplotypes consisting 34 amino acid substitutions 28
synonymous mutations. importantly, two pfcrt mutations (n75d k76t)
implicated chloroquine resistance present parasites new hebrides 
(now vanuatu) eight years first report treatment failure. our
results also revealed unexpectedly high levels genetic diversity pfcrt exon
2 prior historical chloroquine resistance selective sweep, particularly in
areas disease burden relatively low. pacific, parasite genetic
isolation, well host acquired immune status genetic resistance to
malaria, important contributors evolution chloroquine resistance
in p. falciparum.
