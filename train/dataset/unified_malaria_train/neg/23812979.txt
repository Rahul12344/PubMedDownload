motivation: misannotation sequence databases important obstacle for
automated tools gene function annotation, rely extensively on
comparison sequences known function. improve current annotations and
prevent future propagation errors, sequence-independent tools are, therefore, 
needed assist identification misannotated gene products. case
of enzymatic functions, functional assignment implies existence a
reaction within organism's metabolic network; first approximation a
genome-scale metabolic model obtained directly automated genome
annotation. obvious problems network, dead end disconnected
reactions, can, therefore, strong indications misannotation.
results: demonstrate machine-learning approach using network
topological features successfully predict validity enzyme annotations.
the predictions tested three different levels. random forest using
topological features metabolic network trained curated sets of
correct incorrect enzyme assignments found accuracy to
86% 5-fold cross-validation experiments. cross-validation against
unseen enzyme superfamilies indicates classifier successfully
extrapolate beyond classes enzyme present training data. random
forest model applied several automated genome annotations, achieving an
accuracy ~60% cases validated recent genome-scale
metabolic models. also observe applied draft metabolic networks
for multiple species, clear negative correlation observed predicted
