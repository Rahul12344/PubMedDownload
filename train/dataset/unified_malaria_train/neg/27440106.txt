cerebral malaria (cm) shows lethality rate 15-25% despite effective
antimalarial chemotherapy. effective adjunct treatment counteract cm
pathogenesis urgently required. murine cm model, interventions studied
till date administered onset cm symptoms, belittle its
translational value human. studied intramuscular arteether-vitamin d
(art-vd) combination treatment cm outcome improvement onset of
neurological symptoms. intramuscular dose 50 µg kg-1 vd 3 days
combined loading dose 25 mg kg-1 α/β arteether followed 12·5 mg kg-1
dose two consecutive days led significant improvement survival (73% 
combination group vs 29 0% arteether vd monotherapy, respectively) and
clinical recovery. treatment groups partially restored the
blood-brain barrier integrity reduced level serum proinflammatory
cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α interferon-γ. brain transcripts of
inflammatory chemokines viz. cxcl10, cxcl9, ccl4 ccl5 cell migration in
the brain microvasculature significantly diminished treatment
groups. art-vd treatment significantly reduced intercellular cell adhesion
molecule-1 expression. taken together, findings show coordinated actions
of art-vd improve outcome experimental cm.
