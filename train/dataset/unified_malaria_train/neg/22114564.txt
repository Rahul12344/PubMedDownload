the mosquito immune system involved pathogen-elicited defense responses.
the nf-κb factors rel1 rel2 downstream transcription activators toll
and imd immune pathways, respectively. used genome-wide microarray
analyses characterize fat-body-specific gene transcript repertoires activated 
by either rel1 rel2 two transgenic strains mosquito aedes aegypti.
vitellogenin gene promoter used transgenic strain ectopically

significant overlap cactus (rnai)-depleted mosquitoes (50%). in
contrast, rel2+ -regulated transcriptome differed relatively small

the imd pathway, caspar (35 up- 140 down-regulated), suggesting caspar
contributes regulation subset imd-pathway controlled genes. infections
of wild type ae. aegypti plasmodium gallinaceum elicited the

observed fat body transcriptome plasmodium-infected mosquitoes and
that mosquitoes transiently depleted pias, inhibitor jak-stat
