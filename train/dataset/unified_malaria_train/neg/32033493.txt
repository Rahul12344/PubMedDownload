to monitor drug resistance plasmodium vivax, multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr1)
gene putative transporter protein (pvcrt-o) gene used molecular
markers chloroquine resistance. biomarkers, dihydrofolate reductase
(pvdhfr) gene dihydropteroate synthetase (pvdhps) gene, also used
for detection resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp); drug 
often accidentally used treat p. vivax infections. clinical blood samples (n =
120) collected patients one eight malaria-endemic
countries diagnosed p. vivax infection. chloroquine resistance
marker, pvmdr1 gene, showed f976:l1076 mutations l1076 mutation. k10
insertion pvcrt-o gene also found among samples successfully
sequenced. combination l/i57:r58:m61:t117 mutations pvdhfr gene and
g383:g553 mutations pvdhps gene also observed. mutations found in
these genes indicate drug resistance present eight countries.
whether countries using chloroquine treat p. vivax, appears
to increase mutation numbers resistance gene markers. detected
changes mutation rates genes suggest still trend
towards increasing p. vivax resistance chloroquine. presence the
mutations associated sp resistance indicates p. vivax exposure 
to sp may consequence either misdiagnosis coinfections
with&nbsp;p. falciparum past.
