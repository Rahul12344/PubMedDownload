in eukaryotes, cytosine methylation regulates diverse biological processes such
as gene expression, development maintenance genomic integrity. however,
cytosine methylation functions pathogenic apicomplexan protozoans
remain enigmatic. address this, investigated presence cytosine 
methylation nucleic acids protozoan plasmodium falciparum.
interestingly, p. falciparum trdmt1, conserved homologue dna
methyltransferase dnmt2. however, found trdmt1 methylate dna, 
vitro. demonstrate trdmt1 methylates cytosine endogenous aspartic 
acid trna p. falciparum. rna bisulfite sequencing, mapped the
position 5-methyl cytosine aspartic acid trna found methylation at
c38 position. p. falciparum proteome significantly higher aspartic acid
content higher proportion proteins poly aspartic acid repeats 
other apicomplexan pathogenic protozoans. proteins repeats are
functionally important, significant roles host-pathogen interactions.
therefore, trdmt1 mediated c38 methylation aspartic acid trna might play a
critical role translational regulation important proteins modulate 
pathogenicity malarial parasite.
