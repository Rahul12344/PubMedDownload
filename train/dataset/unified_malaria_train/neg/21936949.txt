background: characterization malaria parasite populations circulating in
an area part site characterization, basis evaluating impact of
malaria interventions genetic diversity, parasite species, multiplicity of
infection. present study aimed analysing genetic diversity of
plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface proteins 1 2 (msp-1 msp-2) to
determine multiplicity infection clinical isolates collected from
children living southern district brazzaville republic congo.
methods: total 125 isolates patients uncomplicated malaria
attending terinkyo madibou health centres collected january 
june 2005 evaluating therapeutic efficacy amodiaquine-artesunate
combination. dna extracted msp-1 msp-2 genes genotyped using
allele-specific nested-pcr.
results: 468 distinct fragments detected, 15 msp-1 20 msp-2 genotypes 
were identified. msp-1 gene, k1 family predominant allelic type
carried alone association ro33 mad20 types, whereas 3d7 family
was prevalent msp-2 gene. overall, mean multiplicity of
infection 2.2. 125 samples, 104 (83%) harboured one parasite
genotype. statistical significant difference multiplicity 
infection either sex age patients. however, statistically significant 
correlation found parasite densities number genotypes.
conclusion: polymorphism p. falciparum clinical isolates brazzaville 
high mainly multiple clones. basis positive association
between parasite densities multiplicity infection discussed.
