plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant artemisinins been
detected southeast asia. resistance associated several polymorphisms
in parasite's k13-propeller gene. molecular epidemiology these
artemisinin resistance genotypes african parasite populations unknown. we
developed assay quantify rare polymorphisms parasite populations that
uses pooled deep-sequencing approach score allele frequencies, validated 
by evaluating mixtures laboratory parasite strains, used screen
p. falciparum parasites >1100 african infections collected since 2002 from
14 sites across sub-saharan africa. found mutations african parasite
populations associated artemisinin resistance southeast asian
parasites. however, observed 15 coding mutations, including 12 novel
mutations, limited allele sharing parasite populations, consistent
with large reservoir naturally occurring k13-propeller variation. although
polymorphisms associated artemisinin resistance p. falciparum in
southeast asia prevalent sub-saharan africa, numerous k13-propeller
coding polymorphisms circulate africa. although distributions not
support widespread selective sweep artemisinin-resistant phenotype, 
impact mutations artemisinin susceptibility unknown will
require characterization. rapid, scalable molecular surveillance offers a
useful adjunct tracking containing artemisinin resistance.
