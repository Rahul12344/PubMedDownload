a promising strategy based antisense oligonucleotides the
plasmodium falciparum topoisomerase ii considered using cationic
nanoemulsion oligonucleotide delivery system. phosphodiester chemically
modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides bearing negative charges adsorbed
on positively charged emulsion composed medium chain triglycerides, egg
lecithin, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (dotap), water, at
different +/- charge ratios (positive charges cationic lipid/negative
charges oligonucleotide): +0.5/-, +2/-, +4/- +6/-. physicochemical
properties complexes determined, well stability in
culture medium. interaction erythrocytes hemolysis, binding
experiments confocal microscopy also evaluated. finally, vitro
evaluation parasite growth reinfection capacity performed. overall
results showed antisense oligonucleotides p. falciparum
topoisomerase ii gene efficiently adsorbed onto cationic nanoemulsion
forming complexes. whereas unloaded nanoemulsion displayed hemolytic effect
due presence cationic lipid, case loaded
nanoemulsion low +/- ratios. oligonucleotide-loaded nanoemulsions found
to located inside infected erythrocytes, inhibiting efficiently parasite
growth (until 80%) causing delay p. falciparum life cycle.
