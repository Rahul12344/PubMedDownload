mutations plasmodium falciparum gene kelch13 (pfkelch13) strongly and
causally associated resistance anti-malarial drug artemisinin, 
effects pfkelch13 structure function remain unclear. utilizing the
publicly available three-dimensional structure pfkech13 (pdb id: 4yy8), we
find mutations propeller domain occur two spatial
clusters. these, one cluster enriched surface exposed residues may
drive pfkelch13-centered protein interactions, second cluster mostly
contains residues buried whose mutations may destabilize pfkelch13 
structure. prevalent resistant mutations c580y y493h distal from
the two clusters. c580y mutation creates sterically unfavourable
contacts y493h possibly alters hydrophobic core propeller
domain. analyses facilitate experimental studies aimed at
understanding mutations pfkelch13 lead artemisinin resistance.
