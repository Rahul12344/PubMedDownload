background: clinical symptoms malaria caused asexual
replication plasmodium parasites blood vertebrate host. to
spread new hosts, however, malaria parasite must differentiate sexual
forms, termed gametocytes, ingested mosquito vector. sexual
differentiation produces either female male gametocytes, involves
significant morphological biochemical changes. transformations prepare 
gametocytes rapid progression gamete formation fertilisation,
which occur within 20 min ingestion. present transcriptomes of
asexual, female, male gametocytes p. berghei, comprehensive
statistically-based differential-expression analysis transcriptional
changes underpin sexual differentiation.
results: rna-seq analysis revealed numerous differences transcriptomes 
female male gametocytes compared asexual stages. overall, net
downregulation transcripts gametocytes compared asexual stages, with
this trend marked female gametocytes. analysis identified
transcriptional changes previously-characterised gametocyte-specific pathways,
which validated approach. also detected many previously-unreported female-
and male-specific pathways genes. transcriptional biases stage gender 
were used investigate sex-specificity sexual dimorphism plasmodium
in evolutionary context. sex-related gene expression well conserved between
plasmodium species, relatively poorly conserved related organisms outside 
this genus. pattern conservation evident genes necessary for
both male female gametocyte formation. however, trend less pronounced
for male-specific genes, highly conserved outside genus than
genes specific female development.
conclusions: characterised transcriptional changes integral to
the development female male sexual forms plasmodium. these
differential-expression patterns provide vital insight understanding the
gender-specific characteristics essential stage primary
target treatments block parasite transmission. results also offer
insight evolution sex genes alveolata, suggest many 
plasmodium sex genes evolved within genus. hypothesise male
gametocytes co-opted pre-existing cellular machinery evolutionary
history, whereas female gametocytes evolved development of
novel, parasite-specific pathways.
