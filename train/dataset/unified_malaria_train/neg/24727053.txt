plasmodium falciparum successfully developed resistance almost all
currently used antimalarials. single nucleotide polymorphism p.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene position 76
resulting change coding lysine threonine (k76t) been
implicated corner stone chloroquine resistance. widespread
resistance chloroquine endemic regions led replacement other
antimalarials. areas replacement resulted reversion the
mutant t76 allele wild-type k76 allele. study conducted to
determine prevalence k76t mutation pfcrt gene eight years after
the ban chloroquine sales use. cross-sectional study conducted 6 
regional hospitals ghana. pcr-rflp used analyse samples collected to
determine prevalence pfcrt k76t mutation. 1318 participants
recruited study, 246 found harbour p. falciparum parasites, 
of 60.98% (150/246) showed symptoms malaria. prevalence the
pfcrt t76 mutant allele 58.54% (144/246) k76 wild-type allele
was 41.46% (102/246). difference statistical significance observed in
the distribution alleles symptomatic asymptomatic participants 
(p=0.632). significant association was, again, observed alleles
and parasite density (p=0.314), well alleles hb levels of
the participants (p=0.254). notwithstanding decline prevalence 
pfcrt t76 mutation since antimalarial policy change 2004, 58.54%
prevalence recorded study considered high eight years the
abolishment chloroquine usage ghana. contrast findings from
other endemic areas mutant allele significantly reduced the
population reduction chloroquine use.
