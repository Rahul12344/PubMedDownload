blocking activation nuclear factor κb (nf-κb) promising strategy 
the treatment non-small cell lung cancer. circumsporozoite protein (csp), 
a key component sporozoite stage malaria parasite, previously
reported block nf-κb activation hepatocytes. therefore, present
study, effect csp growth human lung cancer cell line, a549, 
was investigated. demonstrated transfection recombinant
plasmid expressing csp able inhibit proliferation a549 cells a
dose-dependent manner induce apoptosis a549 cells. nf-κb gene
reporter assay indicated csp nuclear localization signal (nls) motif
were able equally suppress activation nf-κb following stimulation 
human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α a549 cells. furthermore,
western blot analysis indicated nls affect phosphorylation and
degradation iκb, able markedly inhibit nuclear translocation of
nf-κb tnf-α stimulated a549 cells. therefore, data suggest csp may be
investigated potential novel nf-κb inhibitor treatment lung
cancer.
