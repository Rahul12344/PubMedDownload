malaria transmission-blocking compounds studied block the
transmission malaria parasites, especially drug-resistant plasmodium.
carboxypeptidase b (cpb) midgut anopheline mosquitoes been
demonstrated essential sexual development plasmodium the
mosquito. thus, cpb potential target blocking compounds. aim 
this research screen compounds national cancer institute (nci)
diversity dataset u.s. food drug administration (fda)-approved drugs that
could reduce anopheles cpb activity. cdna fragment cpb gene an.
minimus (cpbami) amplified sequenced. three-dimensional structure 
cpb predicted deduced amino acid sequence. virtual screening 
the compounds nci diversity set iv fda-approved drugs performed
against cpbami. inhibition activity cpbami top-scoring
molecules characterized in vitro. three compounds-nsc-1014, nsc-332670, and
aminopterin ic50 0.99 mm, 1.55 mm, 0.062 mm, respectively-were found 
to significantly reduce cpbami activity.
