background: plasmodium falciparum malaria remains leading health problem in
africa control seriously challenged drug resistance. although
resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) widespread, combination
remains important component malaria control programmes intermittent
preventive therapy (ipt) pregnant women children. angola, resistance
patterns poorly characterized, ipt employed pregnant
women since 2006. aim study assess prevalence key
antifolate resistance mediating polymorphisms pfdhfr pfdhps genes in
p. falciparum samples angola.
methods: plasmodium falciparum samples collected luanda, 2007, were
genotyped amplification dna forward reverse sequencing pfdhfr
and pfdhps genes.
results: prevalent polymorphisms identified pfdhfr 108n (100%), 51i
(93%), 59r (57%) pfdhps 437g (93%). resistance-mediating polymorphisms in
pfdhps less commonly observed west africa also identified (540e 10%,
581g 7% samples).
conclusion: study documents important prevalence 4 p. falciparum
polymorphisms predicts antifolate resistance luanda. further, some
samples presented additional mutations associated high-level resistance. these
results suggest use sp ipt may longer warranted angola.
