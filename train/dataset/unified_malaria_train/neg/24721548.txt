background: principal malaria vectors africa, an. gambiae an. coluzzii,
share inversion polymorphism left arm chromosome 2 (2la/2l+a) that
is distributed non-randomly environment. genomic sequencing studies
support role strong natural selection maintaining steep clines 2la
inversion frequency along environmental gradients aridity, physiological
studies directly implicated 2la heat desiccation tolerance, the
precise genetic basis underlying behavioral physiological mechanisms 
remain unknown. insect cuticle primary barrier water loss,
differences cuticle thickness and/or epicuticular waterproofing associated
with alternative 2la arrangements might help explain differences desiccation
resistance.
methods: test hypothesis, two subcolonies an. gambiae an.
coluzzii established fixed alternative 2la arrangements (2la
or 2l+a) otherwise homosequential shared genetic background. adult
mosquitoes reared controlled environmental conditions (benign arid) 
eight days post-eclosion collected analyzed. measurements cuticle
thickness made based scanning electron microscopy, cuticular
hydrocarbon (chc) composition evaluated gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry.
results: removing allometric effects body weight, differences in
mean cuticle thickness found alternative 2la karyotypes, not
between alternative environments. moreover, thicker cuticle an.
coluzzii 2la karyotype contrary known higher rate water loss of
this karyotype relative 2l+a. hand, quantitative differences in
individual chcs overall chc profiles alternative karyotypes and
environmental conditions consistent expectation based previous
physiological studies.
conclusions: results suggest alternative arrangements 2la
inversion associated differences cuticle thickness chc
composition, chc composition appears relevant desiccation
resistance. differences chc composition consistent previous
findings lower rate water loss 2l+a karyotype eight days
post-eclosion, suggesting chc composition important strategy for
maintaining water balance genetic background, 2la. despite 
higher rate water loss eight days, higher body water content 2la
karyotype confers level desiccation resistance equivalent the
2l+a karyotype.
