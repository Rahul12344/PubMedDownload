malaria sporozoites deposited skin mosquitoes infect
hepatocytes. molecular basis plasmodium falciparum sporozoites migrate
through host cells poorly understood, direct evidence importance
in vivo lacking. here, generated traversal-deficient sporozoites genetic
disruption sporozoite microneme protein essential cell traversal (pfspect)
or perforin-like protein 1 (pfplp1). loss either gene affect
p. falciparum growth erythrocytes, in contrast previous report that
pfplp1 essential merozoite egress. however, although traversal-deficient
sporozoites could invade hepatocytes in vitro, could establish normal
liver infection humanized mice. contrast nf54 sporozoites,
which infected humanized mice developed exoerythrocytic forms. 
study demonstrates spect perforin-like protein 1 (plp1) critical for
transcellular migration p. falciparum sporozoites demonstrates the
importance cell traversal liver infection human pathogen.
