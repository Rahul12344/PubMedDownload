genetic characteristics plasmodium falciparum may play role treatment
outcome malaria infection. studied association diversity
at merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1), msp-2, glutamate-rich protein
(glurp) loci treatment outcome uncomplicated falciparum malaria
patients along thai-myanmar border treated artemisinin
derivatives combination therapy. p. falciparum isolates collected prior to
treatment 3 groups patients; 50 cases treatment failures, 50
recrudescences, 56 successful treatments. genotyping 3 polymorphic
markers analyzed nested pcr. distribution msp-1 alleles was
significantly different among 3 groups patients msp-2 and
glurp alleles. allelic frequencies k1 mad20 alleles msp1 gene 
higher ro33 allele significantly lower successful treatment
group. treatment failure samples higher median number alleles as
compared successful treatment group. specific genotypes msp-1, msp-2,
and glurp significantly associated treatment outcomes. three
allelic size variants significantly higher among isolates the
treatment failure groups, i.e., k1270-290, 3d7610-630, g650-690, 2
variants, k1150-170, 3d7670-690 significantly lower. conclusion, 
present study reports differences multiplicity infection and
distribution specific alleles msp-1, msp-2, glurp genes p.
falciparum isolates obtained treatment failure successful treatment
patients following artemisinin derivatives combination therapy.
