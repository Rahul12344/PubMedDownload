background: antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) recommended
by world health organization use remote areas improve malaria case 
management. lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) plasmodium falciparum one the
main parasite antigens employed various commercial rdts. been
hypothesized poor detection ldh-based rdts attributed part to
the sequence diversity gene. test this, present study aimed to
investigate genetic diversity p. falciparum ldh gene thailand and
to construct map ldh sequence diversity p. falciparum populations
worldwide.
methods: ldh gene sequenced 50 p. falciparum isolates thailand and
compared hundreds sequences p. falciparum populations worldwide.
several indices molecular variation calculated, including proportion 
of polymorphic sites, average nucleotide diversity index (Ï€), the
haplotype diversity index (h). tests positive selection neutrality tests
were performed determine signatures natural selection gene. mean
genetic distance within species plasmodium ldh analysed to
infer evolutionary relationships.
results: nucleotide sequences p. falciparum ldh could classified 9
alleles, encoding 5 isoforms ldh. l1a common allelic type was
distributed p. falciparum populations worldwide. plasmodium falciparum ldh
sequences highly conserved, haplotype nucleotide diversity values
of 0.203 0.0004, respectively. extremely low genetic diversity was
maintained purifying selection, likely due functional constraints.
phylogenetic analysis inferred close genetic relationship p. falciparum to
malaria parasites great apes, rather human malaria parasites.
conclusions: study revealed global genetic variation ldh gene 
p. falciparum, providing knowledge improving detection ldh-based rdts 
supporting candidacy ldh therapeutic drug target.
