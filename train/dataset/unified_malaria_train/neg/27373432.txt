infection apicomplexan parasite plasmodium falciparum major cause
of morbidity mortality worldwide. one striking features this
parasite ability remodel decrease deformability host red
blood cells, process contributes disease. understand the
virulence pf investigated biochemistry function putative pf
s33 proline aminopeptidase (pfpap). unlike p. falciparum aminopeptidases,
pfpap contains predicted protein export element non-syntenic other
human infecting plasmodium species. characterization pfpap demonstrated that
it exported host red blood cell prolyl
aminopeptidase preference n-terminal proline substrates. addition
genetic deletion exopeptidase shown lead increase the
deformability parasite-infected red cells reduced adherence the
endothelial cell receptor cd36 flow conditions. studies suggest that
pfpap plays role rigidification adhesion infected red blood cells
to endothelial surface receptors, role may make protein novel
target anti-disease interventions strategies.
