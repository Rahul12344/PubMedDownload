evidence natural selection, positive negative, gene encoding antigens
may indicate variation functional constraints immunologically
relevant. malaria surface antigens high genetic diversity been
reported positive-diversifying selection. however, antigens with
limited genetic variation usually ignored terms role natural
selection may generating patterns. investigated orthologous genes
encoding two merozoite proteins, msp8 msp10, among several mammalian
plasmodium spp. antigens, together msp1, among msps that
have two epidermal growth factor-like domains (egf) c-terminal. egf 
are relatively conserved (low levels genetic polymorphism) been
proposed act ligands invasion rbcs. use several
evolutionary genetic methods detect patterns consistent natural selection
acting msp8 msp10 orthologs human parasites plasmodium falciparum
and p. vivax, well closely related malarial species found non-human
primates (nhps). overall, antigens low polymorphism human
parasites comparison orthologs plasmodium spp. found
that msp10 gene polymorphism p. falciparum harbor non-synonymous
substitutions, pattern consistent gene positive selection.
evidence purifying selection found polymorphism observed both
orthologs p. cynomolgi, non-human primate parasite closely related p.
vivax, conclusive human parasite. yet, using phylogenetic
base approaches, found evidence purifying selection msp8 msp10
in lineage leading p. vivax. antigens evolving strong
functional constraints could become valuable vaccine candidates. discuss how
comparative approaches could allow detecting patterns consistent negative
selection even low polymorphism extant populations.
