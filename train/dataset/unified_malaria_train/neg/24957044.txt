background: clonorchiasis, primarily caused liver fluke
(platyhelminthes), fatal infectious disease mainly associated with
bile duct malignancy subsequent development cholangiocarcinoma. thus, 
a genomic approach represents important step knowledge of
biology pathology parasites. results expressed sequence
tags (ests) sequencing need well organized databases provide an
integrated set tools functional information.
findings: here, clonorestdb database represents collection clonorchis
sinensis ests intended resource parasite functional genomics. 
total 55,736 successful est sequences, cleaned clustered into
non-redundant 13,305 c. sinensis assembled est sequences (6,497 clusters and
6,808 singletons), obtained three in-house prepared cdna libraries of
c. sinensis different developmental stages. assembled consensus sequences 
were annotated using blast algorithm or/and hmm ncbi nr, uniprot,
kegg interproscan. clonorestdb database provides functional annotation,
their expression profiles, tandem repeats putative single nucleotide
polymorphisms utility tools local blast search text retrieval.
conclusions: resource enables researcher identify compare
expression signatures different biological stages promotes ongoing
parasite drug vaccine development biological research.database
