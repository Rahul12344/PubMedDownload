the microsporidiosis endangered white-clawed crayfish austropotamobius
pallipes complex generally attributed one species, thelohania
contejeani, agent porcelain disease. species identification mostly
assessed macroscopic examination microscopic evaluation muscle samples
rather molecular ultrastructural analyses. survey conducted a.
pallipes complex populations northern italy highlighted presence two
different microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, t. contejeani an
undescribed octosporoblastic species vairimorpha austropotamobii sp. nov. mature 
spores earlier developmental stages v. austropotamobii sp. nov. found
within striated muscle cells thorax, abdomen, appendages the
crayfish. octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (spvs) was
observed. diplokaryotic sporonts separated two uninucleate daughter cells,
which gave rise rosette-shaped plasmodium, eight uninucleate spores were
produced within persistent spv. ultrastructural features stages the
octosporoblastic sequence similar described vairimorpha
necatrix, type species. mature spores pyriform shape average
of 3.9 × 2.2 µm size. polar filament coiled 11-14 times, lateral to
the posterior vacuole. small subunit ribosomal rna gene (ssu rrna) the
large subunit rna polymerase ii gene (rpb1) v. austropotamobii sp. nov. were
sequenced compared microsporidia. highest sequence identity of
ssu rrna (99%) rpb1 (74%) genes amphipod parasite nosema
granulosis subsequently v. cheracis, infects australian yabby 
cherax destructor. work discuss reasons placing new 
species genus vairimorpha. addition, provide t. contejeani a
rpb1 gene sequence, supplemental sequences ssu rrna gene ultrastructural
details sporogony host a. pallipes complex.
