background: one promising current approaches curb malaria lies in
genetic vector control, implementation require improved
understanding movement genetic constructs among mosquito populations.
to predict potential gene flow one area another, important begin
to understand mosquito dynamics outside commonly-sampled village areas,
and thus genes may move villages. study assessed presence
and relative abundance mosquitoes 6-km corridor two villages in
western burkina faso.
methods: area surrounding villages mapped road them
was used basis transect along sample. five collection points
were placed along transect. investigate larval adult mosquito
presence, multiple sampling approaches used surrounding point:
searching larval sites area 500 radius, swarm sampling, human
landing catches (hlc), cdc light traps backpack aspiration catches of
potential resting sites. sampling took place twice: september october
2015.
results: adult mosquitoes six species anopheles three genera
were found along whole transect. anopheles gambiae (s.l.) most
abundant followed anopheles nili anopheles coustani. larvae anopheles
spp. found small pools surface water along whole transect, though 
their presence increased human proximity. hlc aspiration most
efficient methods collecting adult mosquitoes along whole transect,
indicating host-seeking resting mosquitoes well away from
core village areas. contrast, swarms male mosquitoes, thought the
principle mating locations anopheles spp. mosquitoes west africa, only
found close core village areas.
conclusions: preliminary study indicates anopheles spp. mosquitoes 
both present breeding low human-density areas along transit axes and
provides relative evaluation methods use areas and
evidence gene flow sahelian population centres likely. more
robust structured studies nevertheless needed come stronger
conclusions.
