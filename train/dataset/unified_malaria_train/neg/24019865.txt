the mosquito anopheles gambiae uses innate immune system control bacterial
and plasmodium infection midgut tissue. activation potent imd
pathway-mediated anti-plasmodium falciparum defenses dependent presence
of midgut microbiota, activate defense system upon parasite
infection peptidoglycan recognition protein, pgrplc. employed
transcriptomic reverse genetic analyses compare p. falciparum
infection-responsive transcriptomes septic aseptic mosquitoes to
determine whether bacteria-independent anti-plasmodium defenses exist. antibiotic
treated aseptic mosquitoes mounted molecular immune responses representing a
variety immune functions upon p. falciparum infection. among immune
factors, analysis uncovered serine protease inhibitor (srpn7) and
clip-domain serine protease (clipc2) transcriptionally induced the
midgut upon p. falciparum infection, independent bacteria. also showed that
srpn7 negatively clipc2 positively regulate anti-plasmodium defense,
independently midgut-associated bacteria. co-silencing assays suggested
that two genes may function together signaling cascade. neither gene
was regulated, modulated, infection rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei, suggesting srpn7 clipc2 components defense 
system preferential activity towards p. falciparum. analysis using
rna interference determined genes regulate anti-plasmodium 
defense mediated imd pathway, factors act agonists the
endogenous midgut microbiota, demonstrating lack functional
relatedness genes bacteria-dependent activation imd 
pathway. first study confirming existence a
bacteria-independent, anti-p. falciparum defense. exploration this
anti-plasmodium defense help clarify determinants immune specificity in
the mosquito, expose potential gene and/or protein targets malaria
intervention strategies based targeting parasite mosquito vector.
