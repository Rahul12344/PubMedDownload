members ccp protein family previously described expressed 
on gametocytes apicomplexan plasmodium parasites. knocking plasmodium ccp 
genes blocks development parasite mosquito vector, making the
ccp proteins potential targets development transmission-blocking
vaccine. apicomplexans babesia bovis babesia bigemina causative
agents bovine babesiosis, apicomplexan theileria equi causes equine
piroplasmosis. bovine babesiosis equine piroplasmosis most
economically important parasite diseases affect worldwide cattle equine 
industries, respectively. recent sequencing b. bovis t. equi
genomes provided opportunity identify novel genes involved parasite
biology. characterize three members ccp family, named ccp1, ccp2
and ccp3, b. bigemina, b. bovis t. equi. using b. bigemina vitro 
model, expression three ccp genes proteins demonstrated in
temperature-induced sexual stages. transcripts three ccp genes found
in vivo blood stages t. equi, transcripts ccp3 detected in
vivo blood stages b. bovis. however, protein expression detected 
t. equi blood stages b. bovis blood stages b. bovis tick stages.
collectively, data demonstrated differential pattern expression three
orthologous genes multidomain adhesion ccp family b. bigemina, b. bovis
and t. equi. novel ccp members represent potential targets innovative
approaches control bovine babesiosis equine piroplasmosis.
