stage-specific transcription fundamental biological process life
cycle plasmodium parasite. proteins containing ap2 dna-binding domain 
are responsible stage-specific transcriptional regulation belong the
only known family transcription factors plasmodium parasites. comprehensive
identification target genes advance understanding the
molecular basis stage-specific transcriptional regulation stage-specific
parasite development. ap2-o ap2 family transcription factor is
expressed mosquito midgut-invading stage, called ookinete, is
essential normal morphogenesis stage. study, identified
the genome-wide target genes ap2-o chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing
and elucidate ap2 family transcription factor contributes the
formation motile stage. analysis revealed ap2-o binds
specifically upstream genomic regions 500 genes, suggesting
that approximately 10% parasite genome directly regulated ap2-o.
these genes involved distinct biological processes morphogenesis, 
locomotion, midgut penetration, protection mosquito immunity and
preparation subsequent oocyst development. direct global regulation 
by ap2-o provides model gene regulation plasmodium parasites may
explain parasites manage control complex life cycle using a
small number sequence-specific ap2 transcription factors.
