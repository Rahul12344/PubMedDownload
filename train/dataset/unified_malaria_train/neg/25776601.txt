malaria causes high global mortality morbidity annually. plasmodium knowlesi 
has recognised fifth human plasmodium sp. infection widely
distributed southeast asia. merozoite surface protein-119 (msp-119) appears as
a potential candidate malaria blood stage vaccine could induce
protective immunity. study, codon optimized p. knowlesi msp-119
(pkmsp-119) expressed purified yeast pichia pastoris expression
system. purified recombinant protein evaluated using western blot
assay using knowlesi malaria, non-knowlesi human malaria, non-malarial parasitic 
infections healthy serum samples (n = 50). sensitivity purified
pkmsp-119 towards detection knowlesi infection 28.6% (2/7). pkmsp-119
did react non-malarial parasitic infections healthy donor sera, 
yet reacted non-knowlesi human malaria sera, therefore lead a
specificity 86.0% (37/43).
