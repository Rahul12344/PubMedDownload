a prospective study included 429 children active detection mild
malaria conducted coastal region ghana reveal whether the
incidence malaria affected human leukocyte antigen (hla) polymorphism.
during 12 months follow-up, 85 episodes mild clinical malaria 74
individuals observed, 34 episodes among accompanied with
significant parasitemia >5000 infected red blood cells per cubic millimeter.
attributable relative risks conferred genetic factors hla region
were evaluated comparison incidence children, stratified carrier 
status, given allele hla-a, -b, -drb1 tnfa promoter polymorphism.
hla-b*35:01 reduced incidence 0.178 events per person per year (0.060
versus 0.239 b*35:01-positive -negative subpopulations, respectively),
and relative risk 0.25, remained statistically significant after
bonferroni's correction multiple testing (p(c) = 8.2 × 10(-5)). further,
hla-b*35:01 -b*53:01 exhibited opposite effects incidence malaria
with significant parasitemia. parasite densities different hla carriers
status compared, hla-a*01 conferred increase parasite load (p = 6.0 × 
10(-7)). addition, found novel drb1 allele appears emerged
from drb1*03:02 single nucleotide substitution.
