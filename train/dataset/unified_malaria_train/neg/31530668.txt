plasmodium falciparum complex life cycle involves interaction with
multiple tissues inside human mosquito hosts. identification essential

required clinical development tools malaria control eradication.
however, study p. falciparum limited inability genetically

demonstrate potential deleting essential nonessential genes at
different parasite stages, opens completely new avenues study of
malaria drug development. may also allow realization novel
vaccination strategies using attenuated parasites.
