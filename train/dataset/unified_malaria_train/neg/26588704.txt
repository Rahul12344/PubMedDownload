anopheles sinensis important malaria vector china southeast
asian countries, emergence insecticide resistance mosquito
poses serious threat efficacy malaria control programs. recently 
published an. sinensis genome transcriptome provide opportunity to
understand molecular mechanisms insecticide resistance. analysis the
an. sinensis genome revealed 174 detoxification genes, including 93 cytochrome
p450s (p450s), 31 glutathione-s-transferases (gsts), 50
choline/carboxylesterases (cces). gene number similar an.
gambiae, represented decrease 29% 42% compared aedes aegypti
and culex quinquefasciatus, respectively. considerable contraction gene
number anopheles mosquitoes mainly occurred two detoxification supergene
families, p450s cces. available an. sinensis transcriptome also
re-analyzed identify key resistance-associated detoxification genes.
among 174 detoxification genes, 124 (71%) detected. several candidate genes 
overexpressed deltamethrin-resistant strain (dr-strain) identified as
belonging cyp4 cyp6 family p450s delta gst class. these
generated data provide basis identifying resistance-associated genes of
an. sinensis molecular level.
