characterization hiv-1 subtype diversity regions vaccine trials are
conducted critical vaccine development testing. study describes
the molecular epidemiology hiv-1 within tea-plantation community cohort in
kericho, kenya. sixty-three incident infections ascertained hiv and
malaria cohort study conducted kericho 2003 2006. hiv-1 strains from
58 individuals full genome characterized compared two
previous kenyan studies describing 41 prevalent infections blood bank
survey (1999-2000) 21 infections higher-risk cohort containing mix
of incident prevalent infections (2006). among 58 strains the
community cohort, 43.1% pure subtypes (36.2% a1, 5.2% c, 1.7% g) and
56.9% inter-subtype recombinants (29.3% a1d, 8.6% a1cd, 6.9% a1a2d, 5.2%
a1c, 3.4% a1a2cd, 3.4% a2d). diversity resulting genetic
distance observed strains need addressed vaccine
immunogens chosen. consideration current vaccine development efforts,
the strains three studies compared five candidate vaccines
(each viral vectored, carrying inserts corresponding parts of
gag, pol, envelope), developed possible use in
sub-saharan africa. sequence comparison observed strains 
candidate vaccines indicates presence diverse recombinants, a
bivalent vaccine likely provide t-cell epitope coverage than
monovalent vaccines even inserts bivalent vaccine not
subtype-matched local epidemic.
