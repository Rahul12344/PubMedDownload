intermediate-size noncoding rnas (is-ncrnas) shown play important
regulatory roles development several eukaryotic organisms. however,
they thoroughly explored plasmodium falciparum, the
most virulent malaria parasite infecting human being. using illumina/solexa
paired-end sequencing is-ncrna-specific library, performed systematic 
identification novel is-ncrnas intraerythrocytic p. falciparum, strain 3d7.
a total 1,198 novel is-ncrna candidates, including antisense, intergenic, 
intronic is-ncrnas, identified. bioinformatics analyses showed the
intergenic is-ncrnas least conserved among different plasmodium species,
and antisense is-ncrnas conserved sense counterparts.
twenty-two novel snornas identified, eight potential novel classes p.
falciparum is-ncrnas revealed clustering analysis. expression of
randomly selected novel is-ncrnas confirmed rt-pcr northern blotting
assays. obvious different expressional profile novel is-ncrna between
the early late intraerythrocytic developmental stages parasite was
observed. expression levels antisense rnas correlated of
their cis-encoded sense rna counterparts, suggesting is-ncrnas are
involved regulation gene expression parasite. conclusion, 
accomplished deep profiling analysis novel is-ncrnas p. falciparum,
analysed conservation structural features novel is-ncrnas, and
revealed differential expression patterns development the
parasite. findings provide important information functional
characterisation novel is-ncrnas development p. falciparum.
