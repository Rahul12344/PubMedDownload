emerging evidence suggests dna-sensing pathway plays crucial role in
innate immunity multiple diseases, especially infectious diseases. cyclic
gmp-amp synthase (cgas), dna sensor, stimulator interferon (ifn)
genes (sting), adaptor protein, central components link dna
sensing immunologic functions - including, limited to, type ifn 
response. recently, series studies revealed genomic dna from
protozoan parasites triggers cgas-sting pathway, studies identified
the positive negative regulators modulate signaling parasite
infection. here, summarize current understanding critical functions and
potential applications cgas-sting axis parasitic diseases, specifically
those caused malaria parasites.
