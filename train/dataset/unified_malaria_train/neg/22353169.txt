the human malaria parasite plasmodium vivax globally widespread, causing high 
malaria morbidity. p. vivax highly endemic india, previous reports
indicate genetic homogeneity population samples, tested hypothesis of
no genetic structuring indian p. vivax. further, based reports of
increasing incidence plasmodium falciparum infection comparison with
p. vivax recent years india, important understand whether
reduction population size resulted decrease p. vivax infection rate 
in india. this, utilized recently developed putatively neutral markers
from chromosome 13 p. vivax score single nucleotide polymorphisms 126
p. vivax isolates collected 10 different places india. overall
results indicated indian p. vivax bears high nucleotide diversity within
population samples moderate amount genetic differentiation between
population samples. structure analysis grouped 10 population samples three
clusters based proportion genetic ancestries population.
however, pattern clustering correlate sampling locations 
india. furthermore, analyses past demographic events indicated reduction in
population size majority population samples, isolates the
10 samples considered single population, data fit the
demographic equilibrium model. observations clearly indicate that
indian p. vivax presents complex evolutionary history possesses several
features part ancestral distribution range species.
