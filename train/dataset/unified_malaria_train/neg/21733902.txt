we outline descriptive framework candidate alleles immune system 
associate infectious diseases natural populations animals. three kinds
of alleles separated prevalence infection infection
intensity measured--qualitative disease resistance, quantitative disease
resistance susceptibility alleles. descriptive framework demonstrates why
alleles quantitative resistance susceptibility cannot separated based 
on prevalence data alone, distinguishable infection intensity. then
present case study evaluate previous finding positive association
between prevalence severe avian malaria infection (grw2, plasmodium
ashfordi) major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class allele (b4b) in
great reed warblers acrocephalus arundinaceus. using dataset, find
that individuals allele b4b lower grw2 infection intensities than
individuals without allele. therefore, allele b4b provides quantitative
resistance rather increasing susceptibility infection. implies 
birds carrying b4b mount immune response suppresses acute-phase
grw2 infection, birds without allele cannot may die. argue that
it important determine whether mhc alleles related infections are
advantageous (quantitative qualitative resistance) disadvantageous
(susceptibility) obtain complete picture pathogen-mediated balancing
selection.
