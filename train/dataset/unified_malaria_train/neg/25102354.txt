host cell invasion apicomplexan parasites marks crucial step disease
establishment pathogenesis. moving junction (mj) conserved and
essential feature among parasites phylum host cell invasion, thus 
proteins associate mj potential targets drug vaccine
development. toxoplasma gondii plasmodium falciparum, micronemal
protein, apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1), rhoptry neck proteins (rons; ron2 
and ron4) form essential complex mj. new ron member, ron5, shown 
to important stabilize ron2 development associate mj
complex t. gondii also immunoprecipitated anti-ama1 antibody in
p. falciparum. however, detailed molecular nature ron5 plasmodium is
not well understood. study, plasmodium yoelii ron5 gene (pyron5) was
identified ortholog p. falciparum plasmodium berghei ron5. the
pyron5 exon-intron structure validated comparing genomic dna sequences and
experimentally determining full-length complementary dna sequence. pyron5 was
detected water-insoluble fractions reliable transmembrane domain(s)
were predicted transmembrane prediction algorithms. pyron5 formed complex
with pyron4, pyron2, pyama1 late schizont protein extract. taken together,
we infer results suggest pyron5 associates membrane
indirectly via mj components. indirect immunofluorescence assay and
immunoelectron microscopy localized pyron5 rhoptry neck late
schizont merozoites rhoptry sporozoites. two-stage expression
of pyron5 suggests pyron5 plays roles invasion erythrocytes, 
but also mosquito salivary glands and/or mammalian hepatocytes.
