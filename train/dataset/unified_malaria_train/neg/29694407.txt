malaria remains major threat human health, strains resistant current
therapeutics discovered. efforts finding new drug targets hampered 
the lack sufficiently specific tools provide target validation prior to
initiating expensive drug discovery projects. thus, new approaches can
rapidly enable drug target validation significant interest. this
manuscript present crystal structure malate dehydrogenase from
plasmodium falciparum (pfmdh) 2.4 å resolution structure-based mutagenic
experiments interfering inter-oligomeric interactions enzyme. 
report decreased thermal stability, significantly decreased specific activity and
kinetic parameters pfmdh mutants upon mutagenic disruption either
oligomeric interface. contrast, stabilization one interfaces
resulted increased thermal stability, increased substrate/cofactor affinity
and hyperactivity enzyme towards malate production sub-millimolar
substrate concentrations. furthermore, presented data show designed 
pfmdh mutant could used specific inhibitor wild type pfmdh activity,
as mutated pfmdh copies shown able self-incorporate native
assembly upon introduction vitro, yielding deactivated mutant:wild-type
species. data provide insight role oligomeric assembly in
regulation pfmdh activity reveal recombinant mutants could used as
probe tool specific modification wild type pfmdh activity, thus
offering potential validate druggability vivo without recourse to
complex genetics initial tool compounds. tool compounds often lack
specificity host pathogen proteins (or toxic vivo trials)
and result difficulties assessing cause effect-particularly cases
when enzymes interest possess close homologs within human host.
furthermore, oligomeric interference approach could used future 
order assess druggability challenging human pathogen drug targets.
