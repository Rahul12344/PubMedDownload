diastereoisomers quinidine quinine used treat arrhythmia and
malaria, respectively. reported drugs block herg (human
ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channel essential myocardium
repolarization. abnormality repolarization increases risk arrhythmia. the
aim research study compare impacts quinidine quinine 
on herg. results show drugs block herg channel, quinine
14-fold less potent quinidine. addition, presented distinct impacts 
on channel dynamics. results imply stereospecific block effect the
herg channel. however, f656c-herg reversed stereoselectivity. mutation
decreases affinity two drugs herg, quinine potent than
quinidine f656c-herg blockage. data suggest f656 residue
contributes stereoselective pocket quinidine quinine. further
study demonstrates drugs change herg protein levels. rescue
experiments, found exert reverse effect pentamidine- or
desipramine-induced herg trafficking defect, although quinidine reported
to rescue trafficking-deficient pore mutation herg g601s based interaction
with f656. research demonstrated stereoselective effects quinidine and
quinine herg channel, first study explore their
reversal potency drug-induced herg deficiency.
