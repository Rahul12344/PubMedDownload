the rapid development malaria parasites resistance almost the
chemotherapeutic agents far used control means constant efforts
to develop new drugs necessary. review, propose the
exploration protein-protein interactions new strategy identify
antimalarial drug targets attractive promising area research.
nevertheless, one important criteria targeted gene should
encode essential protein within complex able affect parasite
survival. recently, research biology plasmodium falciparum allowed 
us identify interaction protein phosphatase type 1 actin two
essential partners, pflrr1 pflrr7 respectively, belong the
leucine rich repeat (lrr) protein family. lrr-containing proteins composed of
several consensus lrr motifs lxlxxnxl (where x amino acid) provide
sites assembly protein interactions. lrr combines structural
versatility, adaptability importantly high degree interaction
specificity. addition, shown single mutation a
particular lrr motif abolishes protein-protein interaction contributes to
the expression severe pathology humans. clearly infers blocking
the interaction related 'hot spots' lrr motifs considered good
targets block parasite growth development. thus, inhibition of
protein-protein interactions peptides, peptidomimetics small-molecule
inhibitors interfere binding domains contribute defining new
potential drug targets.
