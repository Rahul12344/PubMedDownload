background: zanzibar recently undergone rapid decline plasmodium
falciparum transmission following combined malaria control interventions with
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) integrated vector control.
artesunate-amodiaquine (asaq) implemented first-line treatment for
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria zanzibar 2003. resistance to
amodiaquine associated single nucleotide polymorphism (snp)
alleles pfcrt 76t, pfmdr1 86y, 184y 1246y. accumulation snp
alleles parasite population time might threaten asaq efficacy.the aim
of study assess whether prolonged use asaq first-line
anti-malarial treatment selects p. falciparum snps associated resistance
to act partner drug amodiaquine.
methods: individual well combined snp allele prevalence were
compared pre-treatment blood samples patients uncomplicated p.
falciparum malaria enrolled clinical trials conducted prior the
introduction asaq 2002-2003 (n = 208) seven years wide scale use 
of asaq 2010 (n = 122).
results: statistically significant decrease pfcrt 76t (96-63%),
pfmdr1 86y (75-52%), 184y (83-72%), 1246y (28-16%) common haplotypes
pfcrt/pfmdr1 tyyd (46-26%) tyyy (17-8%), increase pfcrt/pfmdr1
knfd (0.4-14%) knyd (1-12%).
conclusions: first observation decreased prevalence pfcrt
76t, pfmdr1 86y, 184y 1246y african setting several years of
extensive asaq use first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria. may
support sustained efficacy asaq zanzibar, although unexpected
considering snps previously associated amodiaquine 
resistance. underlying factors results unclear. genetic dilution
by imported p. falciparum parasites mainland tanzania, de-selection by
artesunate per se and/or associated fitness cost might represent contributing 
factors. detailed studies temporal trends molecular markers associated
with amodiaquine resistance required improve understanding this
observation.
