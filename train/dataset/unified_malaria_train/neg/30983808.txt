purpose: scrub typhus acute febrile illness diverse clinical
manifestations, overlap febrile illnesses. due reason,
it misdiagnosed, leading inappropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in
fatality. thus, accurate diagnosis scrub typhus important appropriate
treatment. study evaluated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp)
assay diagnostic test scrub typhus among patients fever.
materials methods: total 50 cases acute febrile illness clinically
resembling scrub typhus, without eschar, cases pyrexia of
unknown origin included study. blood samples collected these
cases subjected detection igm antibodies orientia tsutsugamushi 
elisa, conventional groel polymerase chain reaction (pcr), lamp assay.
results: twelve cases fever less week, two fever 
than 3 weeks. igm antibodies o. tsutsugamushi detected 37 50
samples (74%). lamp assay positive 33 samples (66%). groel gene-based pcr 
detected 35 (70%) samples positive. two samples negative lamp assay were
positive pcr. twenty samples collected patients dengue,
typhoid, malaria tested lamp assay negative, indicating good 
specificity. lamp assay conventional groel-based pcr could detect 72.7%
and 74.3% samples, respectively 10th day onset fever, 
whereas igm elisa could detect 40.5% 37 samples.
conclusion: study suggests lamp assay could useful diagnostic test
for detecting scrub typhus acute phase illness cheaper
alternative molecular methods resource poor settings.
