erythrocyte binding antigen 175 kda (eba-175) well-defined role in
binding glycophorin (gpa) plasmodium falciparum invasion of
erythrocytes. however, eba-175 shed post invasion role shed
protein defined. show eba-175 shed parasites promotes
clustering rbcs, eba-175-dependent clusters occur parasite culture.
region ii eba-175 sufficient clustering rbcs gpa-dependent manner.
these clusters capable forming physiological flow conditions and
across range concentrations. eba-175-dependent rbc clustering provides
daughter merozoites ready access uninfected rbcs enhancing parasite growth.
clustering provides general method protect invasion machinery from
immune recognition disruption exemplified protection neutralizing 
antibodies target ama-1 rh5. findings provide mechanistic
framework role shed proteins rbc clustering, immune evasion, and
malaria.
