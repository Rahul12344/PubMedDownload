background: asian malaria mosquito, anopheles stephensi, major urban
malaria vector middle east indian subcontinent. early zygotic
transcription, marks maternal-to-zygotic transition, been
systematically studied an. stephensi anopheles mosquitoes.
improved understanding early embryonic gene expression an. stephensi will
facilitate genetic evolutionary studies help development of
novel control strategies important disease vector.
results: obtained rna-seq data biological triplicates four early an.
stephensi embryonic time points. using data, identified 70 153 pure 
early zygotic genes (pezgs) stringent relaxed conditions, respectively.
we show pezgs enriched functional groups related dna-binding
transcription regulators, cell cycle modulators, proteases, transport, and
cellular metabolism. average pezgs shorter less introns
than an. stephensi genes. pezgs may arise de novo others 
have clear non-pezg paralogs. limited overlap an.
stephensi pezgs drosophila melanogaster aedes aegypti pezgs.
interestingly, upstream region an. stephensi pezgs lack significant
enrichment previously reported tagteam/vbrggta motif found regulatory
region pezgs d. melanogaster ae. aegypti. however, gt-rich motif 
found an. stephensi pezgs instead.
conclusions: identified number pezgs whose predicted functions and
structures consistent collective roles degradation of
maternally deposited components, activation zygotic genome, cell division,
and metabolism. pezgs appear rapidly turn within dipteran order
and even within culicidae family. pezgs, shared regulatory
motif, could provide promoter regulatory sequences drive gene
expression syncytial early cellular blastoderm, period the
developing embryo accessible genetic manipulation. addition, these
molecular resources may used achieve sex separation mosquitoes for
sterile insect technique.
