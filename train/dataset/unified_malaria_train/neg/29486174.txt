fulani masaleit two sympatric ethnic groups western sudan are
characterised marked differences susceptibility plasmodium falciparum
malaria. demonstrated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency sickle cell trait hbas carriers protected severe
forms malaria. study aimed investigate set specific igg
subclasses p. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (ama-1 3d7),
haemoglobin variants (g6pd) association malaria susceptibility among 
fulani ethnic group compared sympatric ethnic group living western sudan. a
total 124 children aged 5-9 years tribe living area of
hyper-endemic p. falciparum unstable malaria transmission recruited and
genotyped haemoglobin (hb) genes, (g6pd) (abo) blood groups.
furthermore, level plasma igg antibody subclasses p. falciparum
antigen (ama-1) measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (elisa).
higher levels anti-malarial igg1, igg2 igg3 igg4 antibody were
found fulani compared masaleit. individuals carrying hbcc
phenotype significantly associated higher levels igg1 igg2.
furthermore, individuals hbas phenotype associated higher
levels specific igg2 igg4 antibodies. addition, patients g6pd a/a 
genotype associated higher levels specific igg2 antibody compared
with carrying a/g g/g genotypes. results indicate the
fulani ethnic group show lower frequency hbas, hbss hbac compared the
masaleit ethnic group. inter-ethnic analysis shows statistically
significant difference g6pd genotypes (p value = 0.791). however, the
intra-ethnic analysis indicates ethnic groups less a/a genotypes
and (a) allele frequency g6pd compared g/g genotypes, hbsa
genotype associated higher levels igg2 (ama-1) igg4 antibodies.
in addition, patients carrying g6pd a/a genotype associated higher 
levels specific igg2 antibody compared carrying a/g g/g
genotypes. present results revealed fulani ethnic group has
statistically significantly lower frequency abnormal haemoglobin resistant 
malaria infection compared masaleit ethnic group.
