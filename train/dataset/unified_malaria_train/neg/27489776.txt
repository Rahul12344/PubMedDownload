malarial parasite p. falciparum, apicomplexan protozoan 23.3 mb nuclear 
genome encodes ~ 5600 transcripts. genetic diversity parasite
within across geographical zones challenge gene expression studies
which essential understanding disease process, outcome developing 
markers diagnostics prognostics. here, describe strategy involved 
in designing custom p. falciparum 15k array using agilent platform and
genotypic's right design methodology study transcriptome indian field
isolates genome sequence information limited. array contains
probes representing genome sequences two distinct geographical isolates (i.e. 
3d7 hb3) sub-telomeric var gene sequences third isolate (it4) known 
to adhere culture condition. probes array selected based on
their efficiency detect transcripts 244k array experimentation.
array performance 15k array, evaluated validated using rna
materials p. falciparum clinical isolates. large percentage (91%) the
represented transcripts detected indian p. falciparum patient isolates. 
replicated probes multiple probes representing gene showed perfect
correlation suggesting good probe performance. additional
transcripts could detected due inclusion unique probes representing hb3 
strain transcripts. variant surface antigen (vsa) transcripts detected by
optimized probes representing vsa genes three geographically distinct
strains. 15k cross strain p. falciparum array shown good efficiency in
detecting transcripts p. falciparum parasite samples isolated patients.
the low parasite loads presence host rna makes arrays preferred platform
for gene expression studies rna-seq.
