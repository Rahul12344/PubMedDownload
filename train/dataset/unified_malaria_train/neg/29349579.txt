anopheline mosquitoes major vectors malaria parasites. the
gametocytes malaria parasite transferred vertebrate to
mosquitoes, differentiate gametes, fertilized midguts of
mosquitoes. xanthurenic acid (xa), waste product ommochrome synthesis
pathway, shown induce exflagellation microgametogenesis in
vitro; however, currently remains unclear whether endogenous xa affects the
infectivity anopheline mosquitoes malaria parasites vivo due lack
of appropriate experimental systems xa-deficient line. present
study, produced xa-deficient line anopheles stephensi using transcription
activator-like effector nuclease (talen)-mediated gene targeting (knockout) of
the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (kmo) gene, encodes enzyme that
participates ommochrome synthesis pathway. knockout kmo resulted in
the absence xa, oocyst formation inhibited midguts these
xa-deficient mosquitoes, which, turn, reduced sporozoite numbers their
salivary glands. results suggest endogenous xa stimulates
exflagellation, enhances infectivity anopheline mosquitoes malaria 
parasites vivo. xa-deficient line anopheline mosquito provides a
useful system analyzing understanding associated factors malaria
gametogenesis mosquito midgut.
