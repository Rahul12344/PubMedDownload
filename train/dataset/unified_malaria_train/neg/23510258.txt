background: 2006, senegalese national malaria control programme
recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) first-line
treatment uncomplicated malaria. since introduction act, have
been reports level resistance p. falciparum to
anti-malarial drugs. determine whether parasite susceptibility been
affected new anti-malarial policies, ex vivo susceptibility drug
resistance molecular marker study conducted local isolates obtained from
the centre de santé elizabeth diouf (médina, dakar, senegal).
methods: prevalence genetic polymorphisms genes associated with
anti-malarial drug resistance, i.e., pfcrt, pfdhfr, pfdhps pfmdr1, were
evaluated panel 165 isolates collected patients recruited 17
august 2010 6 january 2011. malaria isolates assessed for
susceptibility chloroquine (cq); quinine (qn); monodesethylamodiaquine (mdaq),
the active metabolite amodiaquine; mefloquine (mq); lumefantrine (lmf);
dihydroartemisinin (dha), active metabolite artemisinin derivatives; and
doxycycline (dox) using plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) elisa.
results: prevalence vitro resistant isolates, isolates with
reduced susceptibility, 62.1% mq, 24.2% cq, 10.3% dox, 11.8%
mdaq, 9.7% qn, 2.9% lmf 0% dha. pfcrt 76t mutation was
identified 43.6% samples. pfmdr1 86y, 184f 1246y mutations were
found 16.2%, 50.0% 1.6% samples, respectively. pfdhfr 108n, 51i
and 59r mutations identified 81.9%, 77.4% 79.4% samples,
respectively. double mutant (108n 51i) detected 75.5% the
isolates, triple mutant (108n, 51i 59r) detected 73.6% 
isolates. pfdhps 437g, 436a 613s mutations found 54.4%, 38.6% and
1.2% samples, respectively. one double mutant, 437g and
540e, one quintuple mutant, pfdhfr 108n, 51i 59r pfdhps 437g and
540e. prevalence quadruple mutant (pfdhfr 108n, 51i 59r pfdhps
437g) 36.7%.
conclusions: results study indicate intensive surveillance of
the vitro p. falciparum susceptibility anti-malarial drugs must be
conducted senegal.
