malaria remains major cause disease morbidity mortality sub-saharan
africa complex immune responses associated disease outcomes. symptoms
associated severe malaria generally shown chemokine upregulation but
little known responses uncomplicated malaria. eight villages central 
cameroon 1045 volunteers screened. among these, malaria-positive
individuals healthy controls selected chemokine analysis using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kits. depressed serum levels cxcl5
and raised ccl28 observed malarial positives compared healthy
controls. mean concentration cxcl11 higher symptomatic than
asymptomatic group, ccl28 lower symptomatic individuals. lower
chemokine levels associated symptoms uncomplicated malaria except
for cxcl11 upregulated among fever-positive group. mean cxcl5 level
was higher malaria sole infection co-infections hiv loa loa.
also, raised mean level malaria+hiv co-infection cxcl9. this
study hypothesises situation depressed chemokines face clinical
presentations could indicate attempt immune system preventing a
progression process uncomplicated complicated outcomes cxcl11 
identified possible biomarker malarial fever.
