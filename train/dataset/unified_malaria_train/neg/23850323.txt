plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum becoming resistant drugs
including antifolates, sulphonamides chloroquine. study focused at
sequence analysis resistant genes parasites against
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine chloroquine, bannu, pakistan. known mutations
were detected codons 57, 58 117 pvdhfr gene p. vivax, none 
the isolates pvdhps mutation. similarly p. falciparum isolates exhibited 
double 59r+108n mutations pfdhfr, single 437g pfdhps thus demonstrating
the existance triple mutant 59r+108n+437g haplotype region. key
chloroquine resistance mutation, 76t pfcrt observed 100% p.
falciparum isolates, haplotype svmnt also associated with
resistance amodiaquine. novel mutations also observed pvdhfr 
pfdhfr genes.
