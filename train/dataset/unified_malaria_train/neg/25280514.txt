the occurrence haemosporidians biting midges genus culicoides is
examined north-east bulgaria order reveal potential role for
parasite transmission. pcr-based technique amplifying part mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene parasite applied naturally infected biting midges.
totally, 640 parous individuals four species 95 blood-fed individuals of
six species culicoides examined presence dna of
haemosporidians. haemosporidian genetic lineages identified individuals of
three insect species: culicoides alazanicus (12 lineages, nine lineages of
haemoproteus three lineages plasmodium), culicoides festivipennis and
culicoides circumscriptus (with two one lineages haemoproteus,
respectively). two genetic lineages haemoproteus recorded one
vector species. results demonstrate variations specificity of
haemoproteus genetic lineages potential vectors, since lineages are
recorded single vector species others occur two vector
species.
