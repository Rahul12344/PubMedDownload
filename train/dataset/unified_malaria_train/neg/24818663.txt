the liver efficiently restores function damage induced malarial
infection parasites cleared blood. however, molecular
events leading restoration liver function malaria still
obscure. study this, developed suitable model wherein mice infected 
plasmodium yoelii (45% parasitemia) treated antimalarial
α/β-arteether clear parasites blood and, subsequently, restoration of
liver function monitored. liver function tests clearly indicated that
complete recovery liver function occurred 25 days parasite clearance.
analyses proinflammatory gene expression neutrophil infiltration further
indicated hepatic inflammation, induced immediately parasite
clearance blood, gradually reduced. moreover, inflammation in
the liver parasite clearance found correlated positively with
oxidative stress hepatocyte apoptosis. investigated role heme
oxygenase 1 (ho-1) restoration liver function malaria because
ho-1 normally renders protection inflammation, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis various pathological conditions. expression activity of
ho-1 found increased significantly parasite clearance. even
found chemical silencing ho-1 use zinc protoporphyrin enhanced
inflammation, oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, liver injury. in
contrast, stimulation ho-1 cobalt protoporphyrin alleviated liver
inflammation reduced oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis, associated
tissue injury. therefore, propose selective induction ho-1 the
liver would beneficial restoration liver function parasite
clearance.
