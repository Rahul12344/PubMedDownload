background: male gamete fertilization factor p48/45 malaria parasites a
prime transmission-blocking vaccine (tbv) candidate. efforts develop
antimalarial vaccines often thwarted genetic diversity target
antigens. evaluated genetic diversity pvs48/45 gene global
plasmodium vivax populations.
methods: determined 200 pvs48/45 sequences collected temperate and
subtropical parasite populations china. population genetic evolutionary
analyses performed determine levels genetic diversity, potential
signature selection, population differentiation.
results: analysis pvs48/45 sequences 200 p. vivax parasites collected
in temperate tropical region revealed low level genetic diversity
(π = 0.0012) 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 11 were
nonsynonymous. analysis 344 pvs48/45 sequences nine worldwide p. vivax
populations detected total 38 haplotypes, 13 haplotypes were
present once. multiple tests selection confirmed signature positive
selection pvs48/45 selection skewed second cysteine domain.
haplotype network analysis wright's fixation index showed large geographical 
differentiation presence continent-or region-specific mutations in
this gene.
conclusions: pvs48/45 displays low levels genetic diversity presence 
of region-specific mutations. mutations may potential epitope
targets based positions predicted structure, highlighting the
need future evaluation mutations designing pvs48/45-based tbv.
