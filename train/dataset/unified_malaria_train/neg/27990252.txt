in study, interpreted rna-seq time-course data three developmental
stages plasmodium species clustering genes based similarities their
expression profile without prior knowledge gene function. functional
enrichment clusters upregulated genes specific time-points reveals
potential targetable biological processes information timings. we
identified common consensus sequences clusters shared potential
points coordinated transcriptional control. five cluster groups showed
upregulated profile patterns biological interest. included two clusters
from intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (cluster 4 = 16 genes, cluster
9 = 32 genes), one sexual development stage (cluster 2 = 851 genes), and
two gamete-fertilization stage mosquito host (cluster 4 = 153
genes, cluster 9 = 258 genes). idc expressed least numbers genes
with 1448 genes showing significant activity 5020 genes (~29%) in
the experiment. gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis clusters revealed
a total 671 uncharacterized genes implicated 14 biological processes and
components associated stages, currently being
investigated drug targets on-going research. five putative transcription
regulatory binding motifs shared members cluster also identified,
one also identified previous study separate researchers. our
study shows stage-specific genes biological processes may important
in antimalarial drug research efforts. addition, timed-coordinated control 
separate processes may explain paucity factors parasites.
