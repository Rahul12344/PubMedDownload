studies plasmodium sporozoites liver stages require dissection of
anopheles mosquitoes obtain sporozoites experiments. sporozoites 
rodent parasite p. yoelii routinely used infect hepatocytes liver
stage culture, sometimes cultures become contaminated. using standard
microbiological techniques, single colony type gram-negative rod-shaped
bacteria isolated contaminated cultures. mass spectrometry and
sequencing bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene identified contaminant 
elizabethkingia spp. based sequence comparison published studies the
anopheles microbiome, best match e. anophelis. culture contamination 
not ameliorated density gradient purification sporozoites. however, the
addition vancomycin culture media consistently reduced contamination
and improved culture outcomes measured liver stage parasite size. thus,
mosquito salivary gland-derived e. anophelis identified potential
contaminant plasmodium liver stage cultures mitigated the
addition antibiotics.
