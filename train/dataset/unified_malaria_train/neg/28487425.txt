current efforts reduce global burden malaria threatened the
rapid spread throughout asia plasmodium falciparum resistance to
artemisinin-based combination therapies, includes increasing rates of
clinical failure dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (ppq) cambodia.
using zinc finger nuclease-based gene editing, report addition the
c101f mutation chloroquine (cq) resistance-conferring pfcrt dd2 isoform
common asia confer ppq resistance cultured parasites. resistance was
demonstrated significantly higher ppq concentrations causing 90% inhibition of
parasite growth (ic90) 50% parasite killing (50% lethal dose [ld50]). this
mutation also reversed dd2-mediated cq resistance, sensitized parasites to
amodiaquine, quinine, artemisinin, conferred amantadine blasticidin
resistance. using heme fractionation assays, demonstrate ppq causes a
buildup reactive free heme inhibits formation chemically inert
hemozoin crystals. data evoke inhibition heme detoxification the
parasite's acidic digestive vacuole primary mode the
bis-aminoquinoline ppq related 4-aminoquinoline cq. drugs also
inhibit hemoglobin proteolysis elevated concentrations, suggesting an
additional mode action. isogenic lines differing pfmdr1 copy number
showed equivalent ppq susceptibilities. propose mutations pfcrt could 
contribute multifactorial basis ppq resistance field

continued success artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts), target
the asexual blood stages intracellular parasite plasmodium partial
resistance artemisinin, however, established southeast asia,
exposing partner drugs increased selective pressure. plasmodium falciparum
resistance first-line partner piperaquine (ppq) spreading rapidly
in cambodia, resulting clinical treatment failures. here, report a
variant form plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter,
harboring c101f mutation edited chloroquine (cq)-resistant dd2 isoform
prevalent asia, confer ppq resistance cultured parasites. was
accompanied loss cq resistance. biochemical assays showed ppq, like 
cq, inhibits detoxification reactive heme formed by
parasite-mediated catabolism host hemoglobin. propose novel pfcrt
variants emerging field could contribute multigenic basis ppq
