β-thalassemia (β-thal) considered rare central europe. other
malaria-free regions, presence β-thal central europe reflects
historical recent immigration, demographic changes influenced
the genetic variability current populations living area. this
study assesses frequency spectrum mutations β-globin gene in
czech slovak subjects clinical symptoms thalassemia. results of
the initial part research published two decades ago; the
aim study update original reports. period from
2002 2015, 400 cases czech slovak hematological centers were
analyzed. twenty-nine β-thal mutations, identified 356 heterozygotes 218 
unrelated families, involve five unique mutations including recently described 
insertion transposable l1 element β-globin gene. one mutation
described reported first time. mutations of
mediterranean origin accounted 82.0% cases. one case studied
were heterozygous carriers, manifesting β-thal minor, rare exceptions
represented rare (β(0)) codons 46/47 (+g) (hbb: c.142_142dupg) mutation
associated α-globin gene quadruplication dominantly inherited
β-thal severe phenotype. one double heterozygous β-thal patient a
recent immigrant moldavia. list δβ-thal alleles (26 carriers, 16
families) contains hb lepore two types δβ(0)-thal deletions. past, 
genetic drift migration well recent immigrations responsible for
the introduction mediterranean alleles, several mutations described in
single families local origin.
