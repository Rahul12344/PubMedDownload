background: merozoite surface protein 7 (msp7) plasmodium protein 
is involved parasite invasion; gene encoding belongs multigene
family. proposed msp7 paralogues seem functionally
redundant; however, recent experiments suggested could have
different roles.
results: msp7 multigene family described newly available
plasmodium genomes; phylogenetic relationships established 12 species 
using different molecular evolutionary approaches assessing functional
divergence amongst msp7 members. gene expansion contraction rule msp7 family 
evolution; however, members could concerted evolution. molecular
evolutionary analysis showed relaxed and/or intensified selection modulated 
plasmodium msp7 paralogous evolution. furthermore, episodic diversifying
selection changes evolutionary rates suggested paralogous
proteins diverged functionally.
conclusions: even though msp7 mainly evolved line birth-and-death
evolutionary model, gene conversion taken place paralogous genes
allowing maintain functional redundancy. hand, the
evolutionary rate msp7 paralogs become altered, well undergoing
relaxed intensified (positive) selection, suggesting functional divergence.
this could mean msp7s form different parasite protein complexes
and/or recognise different host receptors parasite invasion. results
highlight importance gene family plasmodium genus.
