background: plasmodium vivax malaria remains major health problem tropical
and sub-tropical regions worldwide. several rhoptry proteins important 
for interaction and/or invasion red blood cells, pfrons, pf92,
pf38, pf12 pf34, described last years 
considered potential anti-malarial vaccine candidates. study describes
the identification characterization p. vivax rhoptry neck protein 1
(pvron1) examine antigenicity natural p. vivax infections.
methods: pvron1 encoding gene, homologous encoding p.
falciparum apical sushi protein (asp) according plasmodb database, was
selected study target. pvron1 gene transcription evaluated by
rt-pcr using rna obtained p. vivax vcg-1 strain. two peptides derived
from deduced p. vivax sal-i pvron1 sequence synthesized inoculated
in rabbits obtaining anti-pvron1 antibodies used confirm the
protein expression vcg-1 strain schizonts along association with
detergent-resistant microdomains (drms) western blot, localization 
immunofluorescence assays. antigenicity pvron1 protein assessed
using human sera individuals previously exposed p. vivax malaria by
elisa.
results: p. vivax vcg-1 strain, ron1 764 amino acid-long protein. 
silico analysis revealed pvron1 shares essential characteristics with
different antigens involved invasion, presence secretory
signal, gpi-anchor sequence putative sushi domain. pvron1 protein 
expressed parasite's schizont stage, localized rhoptry necks is
associated drms. recombinant protein recognition human sera indicates
that antigen trigger immune response natural infection 
p. vivax.
conclusions: study shows identification characterization p.
vivax rhoptry neck protein 1 vcg-1 strain. taking account pvron1
shares several important characteristics plasmodium antigens play
a functional role rbc invasion and, shown here, antigenic, it
could considered good vaccine candidate. studies aimed at
assessing immunogenicity protection-inducing ability aotus monkey 
model thus recommended.
