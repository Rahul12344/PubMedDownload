the analysis vitro anti-malarial drug susceptibility testing vulnerable 
to effects different statistical approaches selection biases. these
confounding factors assessed respect pfmdr1 gene mutation and
amplification 490 clinical isolates. two statistical approaches estimating
the drug concentration associated 50% effect (ec50 ) compared: the
commonly used standard two-stage (sts) method, nonlinear mixed-effects
modelling. vitro concentration-effect relationships for, chloroquine,
mefloquine, lumefantrine artesunate, derived clinical isolates

genotyped polymorphisms pfmdr1 gene. ec50 estimates similar
for two statistical approaches 15-28% isolates sts method a
high coefficient variation (>15%) individual estimates ec50 these
isolates ec50 values 32 66% higher isolates derived with
more precision. total 41% (202/490) isolates amplification pfmdr1
and single nucleotide polymorphisms found 50 (10%). pfmdr1 amplification 
was associated increase ec50 mefloquine (139% relative increase in
ec50 2 copies, 188% 3+ copies), lumefantrine (82% 75% 2 3+
copies respectively) artesunate (63% 127% 2 3+ copies
respectively). contrast pfmdr1 mutation codons 86 1042 associated
with increase chloroquine ec50 (44-48%). sample size calculations showed
that demonstrate ec50 shift 50% 80% power prevalence
was 10% would require 430 isolates 245 isolates prevalence 20%. in
conclusion, although nonlinear mixed-effects modelling demonstrate any
major advantage determining estimates anti-malarial drug susceptibility,
the method includes isolates, thereby, potentially improving confirmation 
candidate molecular markers anti-malarial drug susceptibility.
