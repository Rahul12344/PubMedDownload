despite importance sexual differentiation reproduction, chromosome
genes rarely described reside repeat-rich regions are
difficult study. here, show guy1, unique chromosome gene a
major urban malaria mosquito anopheles stephensi, confers 100% female lethality
when placed autosomes. show small guy1 protein (56 amino acids
in length) causes female lethality males carrying transgene are
reproductively competitive non-transgenic siblings under
laboratory conditions. guy1 protein primary signal chromosome
that affects embryonic development sex-specific manner. results have
demonstrated, first time mosquitoes, feasibility stable
transgenic manipulation sex ratios using endogenous gene the
male-determining chromosome. results provide insights elusive m
factor suggest exciting opportunities reduce mosquito populations and
disease transmission.
