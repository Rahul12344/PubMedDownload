background: disease re-emergence threat major malaria vector sri 
lanka, anopheles culicifacies, currently increasing. predict malaria vector
dynamics, knowledge population genetics gene flow required, this
information unavailable sri lanka. study carried determine
the population structure an. culicifacies e sri lanka.
methods: eight microsatellite markers used examine an. culicifacies e
collected six sites sri lanka 2010-2012. standard population
genetic tests analyses, genetic differentiation, hardy-weinberg equilibrium, 
linkage disequilibrium, bayesian cluster analysis, amova, samova and
isolation-by-distance conducted using five polymorphic loci.
results: five microsatellite loci highly polymorphic high allelic
richness. hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe) significantly rejected four
loci positive f(is) values pooled population (p < 0.0100). three loci
showed high deviations sites except kataragama, agreement
with hwe loci except one locus (p < 0.0016). observed heterozygosity 
less expected values sites except kataragama, reported
negative f(is) values indicated heterozygosity excess. genetic differentiation 
was observed sampling site pairs supported isolation
by distance model. bayesian clustering analysis identified presence three 
sympatric clusters (gene pools) studied population. significant genetic
differentiation detected cluster pairs low gene flow isolation by
distance detected clusters. furthermore, results suggested
the presence barrier gene flow divided populations two
parts central hill region sri lanka dividing line.
conclusions: three sympatric clusters detected among an. culicifacies e
specimens isolated sri lanka. effect geographic distance on
genetic differentiation central mountain ranges sri lanka appeared 
be barrier gene flow.
