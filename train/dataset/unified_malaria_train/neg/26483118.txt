artemisinin combination therapy (act) first line treat uncomplicated
plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide. artemisinin treatment failures on
the rise southeast asia. delayed parasite clearance act associated
with mutations p. falciparum kelch 13 gene. patients (n = 148) five
districts northwest ethiopia enrolled 28-day act trial. we
identified unique kelch 13 mutation (r622i) 3/125 (2.4%) samples. three 
isolates r622i negade-bahir aykel districts close the
ethiopia-sudan border. one three patients mutant strain was
parasitemic day 3; however, patients cleared parasites day 28.
correlation kelch 13 mutations parasite clearance possible
