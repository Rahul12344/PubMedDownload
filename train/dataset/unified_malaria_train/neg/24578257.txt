although prevalence malaria remains high parts bangladesh, there
continues substantial shortage information regarding less common
malaria parasites plasmodium malariae plasmodium knowlesi. recent
studies indicate p. malariae may extremely rare, far, no
data presence (or absence) p. knowlesi southeastern bangladesh.
genus- species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of
the small subunit ribosomal rna gene performed assess presence and
prevalence p. malariae p. knowlesi 2,246 samples originating from
asymptomatic febrile participants cross-sectional febrile
illnesses study chittagong hill tracts southeastern bangladesh. p.
malariae detected 60 samples (2.7%) corresponding 8% 746 samples
giving positive pcr results plasmodium sp., mainly high
prevalence (9.5%) among asymptomatic study participants testing positive for
malaria. symptomatic cases common (4.3% symptomatic malaria
cases) dry season. parasitemias low (1,120-2,560/μl in
symptomatic 120-520/μl asymptomatic carriers). symptomatic patients
presented mild moderate symptoms like fever, chills, headache, dizziness,
fatigue myalgia.although intermediate well definite host
are known endemic southeastern bangladesh, evidence presence 
of p. knowlesi found. conclude role p. malariae highly
underestimated rural bangladesh major implications malaria control
and elimination strategies.
