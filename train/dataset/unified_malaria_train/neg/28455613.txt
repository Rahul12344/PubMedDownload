heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) molecular chaperone plays important
role cellular proteostasis. hsp70s also implicated survival and
pathogenicity malaria parasites. main agent malaria, plasmodium
falciparum, expresses six hsp70s. these, two (pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z)
localize parasite cytosol. previously conducted gene knockout studies
suggested pfhsp70-z essential, demonstrated that
small-molecule inhibitors targeting pfhsp70-1 cause parasite death. this
reason, pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z potential antimalarial targets. two
cyclic lipopeptides, colistin polymyxin b (pmb), shown bind
another heat shock protein, hsp90, inhibiting chaperone function. the
current study, investigated effect pmb structure-function
features pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z. using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we
observed pmb directly interacts pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z. in
addition, using circular dichroism spectrometric analysis combined with
tryptophan fluorescence measurements, observed pmb modulated the
secondary tertiary structures hsp70. furthermore, pmb inhibited basal 
atpase activity chaperone function two hsp70s. findings suggest
that pmb associates hsp70 inhibit function. light central
role hsp70 cellular proteostasis essential role development 
of malaria parasites particular, findings expand library of
small-molecule inhibitors target medically important class molecular
chaperones.
