spleen plays important role removing old damaged red blood cells and
malaria-infected erythrocytes. malaria parasites invade spleen and
induce splenomegaly, splenic function tends impaired. thus, inhibition 
of splenomegaly strongly required protect spleen. study,
malaria-induced splenomegaly inhibited injecting genistein a
plasmodium berghei-infected icr mouse. explain phenomenon, effect 
genistein spleen liver malaria-infected mice evaluated by
histological examination. malaria parasites disrupted splenic architecture. after
treating genistein, disrupted architecture red white pulp
regions clearly separated recovered uninfected ones. changes in
biophysical properties blood studied measuring viscosity blood 
collected malaria-infected uninfected mice using microfluidic
viscometer. genistein also negligible influence variation blood
viscosity. enzymatic activity expression pattern proteins then
investigated explain genistein effect malaria-induced splenomegaly.
genistein potential drug splenomegaly p. berghei-infected mouse.
