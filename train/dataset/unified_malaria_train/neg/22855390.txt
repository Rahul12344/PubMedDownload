human babesiosis, blood-borne infection caused several species babesia,
including b. microti, emerging disease endemic northeast,
upper midwest, pacific northwest regions united states. risk factors
for babesiosis include exposure infected tick vector blood
transfusions infected donors. work, cloned expressed two of
the immunodominant antigens b. microti used multiplex bead
format assay (mba) detect parasite-specific igg responses human sera. the
mba using recombinant b. microti secreted antigen 1 (bmsa1) protein more
specific (100%) slightly sensitive (98.7%) assay using a
truncated recombinant bmn1-17 construct (97.6% 97.4%, respectively). although
some antibody reactivity observed among sera confirmed-malaria patients,
only one plasmodium falciparum sample simultaneously positive igg
antibodies antigens. neither antigen reacted sera babesiosis
patients infected babesia species b. microti. both
positive negative mba results reproducible assays between
instruments. additional studies recombinant antigens the
multiplex bead assay using blood samples clinically defined babesiosis
patients blood donors needed clearly define usefulness
as blood screening assay.
