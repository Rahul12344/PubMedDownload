under stressful conditions, cellular heme catabolism carbon monoxide, iron and
biliverdin mediated 32 kda enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1). wide
range pro-oxidant inflammatory stimuli act diverse consensus sequences 
within hmox1 promoter rapidly induce gene. ample evidence
attesting beneficial effects ho-1 upregulation brain. converting 
pro-oxidant heme antioxidants, biliverdin bilirubin, ho-1/biliverdin
reductase may help restore favorable tissue redox microenvironment.
contrariwise, cell types certain circumstances, heme-derived
carbon monoxide iron may amplify intracellular oxidative stress and
exacerbate disease process. inimical side neural ho-1 often 
ignored biomedical literature promulgating interventions aimed boosting
central ho-1 expression management diverse cns conditions the
focus current review. comprehensive model astroglial stress is
presented wherein sustained hmox1 induction promotes oxidative mitochondrial
membrane damage, iron sequestration mitophagy (macroautophagy). ho-1
mediated gliopathy renders nearby neuronal constituents vulnerable oxidative
injury recapitulates 'core' neuropathological features many aging-related 
neurodegenerative neurodevelopmental brain disorders. balanced
literature acknowledge that, host chronic human cns afflictions,
the glial ho-1 response may serve robust transducer noxious stimuli, an
important driver relevant neuropathology potentially disease-modifying
therapeutic target.
