genetic control strategies aimed bias sex progenies towards males
present promising new paradigm eliminate malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. 
synthetic sex-ratio distortion (sd) system successfully engineered in
anopheles gambiae exploiting meiotic activity i-ppoi endonuclease
targeting ribosomal dna (rdna) repeats, exclusively located x chromosome. 
males carrying sd construct produce highly male-biased progenies without
evident reduction fertility. study, investigated fate x 
y chromosomes sd males found ratios mature x:y-bearing sperm
were comparable wild-type insects, indicating absence selection mechanisms 
during sperm maturation. therefore tested effect meiotic cleavage of
both x chromosomes lab-generated sd strain carrying rdna sex
chromosomes, showing fertility comparable wild-type reduced male-bias
compared sd males x targeted. exposure y-linked rdna
to i-ppoi cleavage consecutive generations rapidly restored male-bias 
typical high frequencies, indicating correlation number of
cleavable targets sex chromosome sex-ratios found progeny.
altogether results indicate meiotic cleavage rdna repeats, located in
the sex chromosomes a. gambiae sd males, affects competitiveness mature
sperm fertilize female oocyte, thereby generating sex-biased progenies. we
also show presence rdna copies chromosome impair
the effectiveness engineered synthetic sd systems control human
malaria mosquitoes.
