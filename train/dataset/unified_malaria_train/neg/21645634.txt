a combination chloroquine (cq) primaquine (pq) used the
first-line treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria rangamati,
bangladesh end 2004. doctors medical staffs felt cq plus
pq become less effective uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients,
but effective minority-indigenous patients 
bengali patients. efficacy cq plus pq mutation status cq
resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene infecting p. falciparum were, thus,
investigated 45 uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients rangamati in
2004. total failure rate 57.8%. one two pfcrt sequences (cieth and
smnth positions 72, 74-76, 97, mutation underlined) k76t mutation
known related cq-resistant phenotype detected 38 patients' blood
samples. 38 patients, total 15 patients (14/25 minority-indigenous 
1/13 bengali patients) resulted adequate clinical parasitological response
(acpr). statistically significant difference acpr rate the
minority-indigenous patients bengali patients. p. falciparum mutant 
or resistant pfcrt (pfcrt-resistant) detected pcr blood samples day 
28 10 acpr minority-indigenous patients one bengali acpr
patient, infected pfcrt-resistant p. falciparum day 0. the
minority-indigenous patients, bengalis, suggested often cured
by cq plus pq, leaving parasites detectable pcr, even when
they infected pfcrt-resistant p. falciparum.
