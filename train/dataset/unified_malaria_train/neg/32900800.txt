malaria parasites increase host erythrocyte's permeability various
nutrients, fueling intracellular pathogen development replication. the
plasmodial surface anion channel (psac) mediates uptake linked the
parasite-encoded rhoph complex, consisting clag3, rhoph2, rhoph3. while
interactions subunits well established, clear whether
they remain associated synthesis developing merozoites through
erythrocyte invasion trafficking host membrane. here, explored
protein-protein interactions rhoph subunits using live-cell imaging and
f√∂rster resonance energy transfer (fret) experiments. using green fluorescent
protein (gfp) derivatives mcerulean mvenus, generated single- and
double-tagged parasite lines fluorescence measurements. clag3-mcerulean
served efficient fret donor rhoph2-mvenus within rhoptry organelles,
mcerulean targeted organelle via short signal sequence produced
negligible fret. upon merozoite egress reinvasion, tagged rhoph
subunits deposited new host cell's parasitophorous vacuole; these
proteins exported trafficked erythrocyte membrane, where
clag3 rhoph2 remained fully associated. fluorescence intensity measurements
identified stoichiometric increases exported rhoph protein erythrocytes
are infected two parasites; whole-cell patch-clamp revealed concomitant
increase psac functional copy number dose effect rhoph contribution 
to ion nutrient permeability. studies establish live-cell fret imaging 
in human malaria parasites, reveal rhoph subunits traffic host
membrane destination without dissociation, suggest quantitative contribution 
to psac formation.importance malaria parasites grow within circulating red blood 
cells uptake nutrients pore host membrane. here, used
gene editing tag clag3 rhoph2, two proteins linked nutrient pore,
with fluorescent markers tracked proteins living infected cells.
after synthesis mature parasites, imaging showed proteins 
packaged membrane-bound rhoptries. parasites ruptured host cells 
and invaded new red blood cells, proteins detected within vacuole
around parasite migrated inserted surface membrane 
the host cell. using simultaneous labeling clag3 rhoph2, determined
that proteins interact tightly migration surface membrane 
insertion. red blood cells infected two parasites twice protein at
their surface parallel increase number nutrient pores. work
suggests proteins directly facilitate parasite nutrient uptake from
human plasma.
