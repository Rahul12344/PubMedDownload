background: resistance multiple classes insecticides detected in
the malaria vector anopheles albimanus northwest peru. acetylcholinesterase
(ache) insensitivity previously associated resistance to
organophosphate (op) carbamate (ca) insecticides arthropods. single
point mutation ace-1 gene (g119s) associated resistance ops and
cas described previously four anopheline species, in
field-collected an. albimanus. present study aimed characterize role
of ace-1 conferring resistance ops cas an. albimanus
population tumbes, peru.
methods: frequency intensity resistance ops cas quantified 
through bioassays female an. albimanus collected 2012 2014, and
the presence insensitive ache confirmed using biochemical assays. a
portion ace-1 gene flanking codon 119 amplified sequenced from
individuals used bioassays biochemical assays, well from
historical samples collected 2008. statistical analyses conducted to
determine: (1) associations genotype ache insensitivity; and, (2)
associations genotype resistance phenotype.
results: confirming high levels resistance fenitrothion, malathion,
and bendiocarb bioassays, two novel polymorphisms identified 
first second loci codon 119, individuals 2012-2014
collections heterozygous first base (g/t) either heterozygous
(g/c) homozygous mutants (c/c) second base. based sequence data from
historical samples, mutations arose prior 2008, became fixed 
population 2008 2012. homozygotes second locus had
significantly higher levels ache insensitivity heterozygotes (p <0.05).
individuals phenotypically susceptible ops cas likely be
heterozygous second locus (p <0.01). cloning identified four individuals
each containing three distinct genotypes, suggesting duplication the
ace-1 gene may occurred.
conclusions: occurrence heterozygotes two loci presence of
three genotypes four individuals suggest balancing selection could be
maintaining op ca resistance population, minimizing associated 
fitness costs.
