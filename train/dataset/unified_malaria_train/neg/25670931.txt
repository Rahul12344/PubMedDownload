the search genetic determinants alloimmunization sickle cell disease
transfusion recipients based two premises: i) polymorphisms
responsible stronger immune and/or inflammatory responses hemoglobin β(s)
mutation co-selected malaria; ii) stronger responder status
contributes development lupus. found marker alloimmunization the
gene encoding ro52 protein, also known sjögren syndrome antigen 1 (ssa1)
and trim21. surprisingly, nature association opposite with
lupus; variant polymorphism (rs660) associated lupus 
incidence also associated induction tolerance red blood cell
antigens early childhood. dual function ro52 explain this
apparent contradiction. propose lupus/autoimmunity susceptibility
loci may reveal roles additional molecules various aspects of
alloimmunization induced transfusion well pregnancy.
