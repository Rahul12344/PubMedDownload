the emergence artemisinin-resistant parasites since late 2000s the
border cambodia thailand poses serious threats malaria control
globally, particularly africa bears highest malaria transmission
burden. study aimed obtain reliable data current state the
kelch13 molecular marker artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum in
cameroon. dna extracted dried blood spots collected from
epidemiologically distinct endemic areas center, littoral north
regions cameroon. nested pcr products kelch13-propeller gene were
sequenced analyzed abi 3730xl automatic sequencer. 219 dried blood
spots, 175 sequenced successfully. identified six k13 mutations 2.9%
(5/175) samples, including 2 non-synonymous, v589i allele been
reported africa already one new allele e612k reported yet.
these two non-synonymous mutations uniquely found parasites the
littoral region. one sample showed two synonymous mutations within kelch13
gene. also observed two infected samples mixed k13 mutant k13
wild-type infection. taken together, data suggested circulation the
non-synonymous k13 mutations cameroon. albeit mutations known be
associated parasite clearance delays study population, need 
for continuous surveillance earlier detection resistance long acts
are used scaled community.
