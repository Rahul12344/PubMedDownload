background: patterns emerging drug resistance reflect underlying adaptive 
landscapes specific drugs. plasmodium falciparum, parasite causes
the serious form malaria, antifolate drugs inhibit function of
essential enzymes folate pathway. however, handful mutations the
gene coding one enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, confer drug resistance.
understanding evolution proceeds drug susceptibility drug resistance 
is critical new antifolate treatments sustained usefulness.
methodology/principal findings: use transgenic yeast expression system to
build previous studies described adaptive landscape the
antifolate drug pyrimethamine, describe likely evolutionary
trajectories evolution drug resistance antifolate
chlorcycloguanil. find adaptive landscape chlorcycloguanil is
multi-peaked, highly resistant alleles equally accessible by
evolution, commonalities differences adaptive
landscapes chlorcycloguanil pyrimethamine.
conclusions/significance: findings suggest cross-resistance between
drugs targeting enzyme reflect fitness landscapes associated with
each particular drug position genotype landscapes. the
possible public health implications findings discussed.
