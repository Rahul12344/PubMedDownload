background: validation drug targets malaria human diseases
remains highly difficult laborious process. vast majority cases, 
highly specific small molecule tools inhibit proteins function vivo are
simply available. additionally, use genetic tools analysis of
malarial pathways challenging. issues result difficulties in
specifically modulating hypothetical drug target's function vivo.
objective: current "toolbox" various methods techniques identify 
protein's function vivo remains limited pressing need 
expansion. new approaches urgently required support target validation in
the drug discovery process.
method: oligomerisation natural assembly multiple copies single
protein one object self-assembly present half of
all protein structures. thus, oligomerisation plays central role the
generation functional biomolecules. key feature oligomerisation that
the oligomeric interfaces individual parts final assembly 
highly specific. however, interfaces yet systematically
explored exploited dissect biochemical pathways vivo.
results conclusion: mini review describe current state the
antimalarial toolset well potentially druggable malarial pathways. a
specific focus drawn initial efforts exploit oligomerisation
surfaces drug target validation. alternative conventional methods,
protein interference assay (pia) used specific distortion the
target protein function pathway assessment vivo.
