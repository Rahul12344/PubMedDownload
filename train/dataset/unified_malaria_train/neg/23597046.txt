background: southern mexico, malaria transmission low, seasonal, and
persistent. many patients affected two malaria episodes
caused plasmodium vivax, carried study determine timing,
frequency, genetic identity recurrent malaria episodes region
between 1998 2008.
methods: symptomatic patients one p. vivax infection followed
up, blood samples collected primary recurrent infections. dna
extracted infected blood samples analyzed restriction fragment
length polymorphism (rflp) genes encoding csp msp3α, well size
variation seven microsatellites.
results: one hundred forty six parasite samples collected 70
patients; these, 65 patients one recurrent infection, four two, and
one three recurrent infections. majority recurrent infections occurred
within one year primary infection, genetically
homologous primary infection. genetic diversity background
population high, probability homologous re-infection low the
homologous recurrences likely reflected relapses. homologous recurrent
infections generally short (< 6 months) long (6-12 months) intervals
between primary (pi) recurrent (ri) infections; whereas infections
containing heterologous genotypes relatively longer intervals. the
epidemiological data indicate heterologous recurrences could either
relapse re-infections.
conclusions: genetic temporal analysis p. vivax recurrence patterns in
southern mexico indicated relapses play important role initiating
malaria transmission season. manifestation infections during
the active transmission season allowed propagation diverse hypnozoite
genotypes. short- long-interval relapses contributed parasite
persistence must considered targets treatment malaria
elimination programs region successful.
