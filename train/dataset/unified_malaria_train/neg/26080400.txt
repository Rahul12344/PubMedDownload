plasmodium parasites must complete development mosquito vector for
transmission occur. mosquito innate immune response remarkably
efficient limiting parasite numbers. previous work identified a
lps-induced tnfÎ± transcription factor (litaf)-like transcription factor,
litaf-like 3 (ll3), significantly influences parasite numbers. here, we
demonstrate ll3 influence invasion mosquito midgut
epithelium ookinete-to-oocyst differentiation mediates late-phase immune
response decreases oocyst survival. ll3 expression midgut and
hemocytes activated ookinete midgut invasion independent the
mosquito microbiota, suggesting ll3 may component wound-healing
response. ll3 silencing abrogates ability mosquito hemocytes to
differentiate respond parasite infection, implicating hemocytes as
critical modulators late-phase immune response.
