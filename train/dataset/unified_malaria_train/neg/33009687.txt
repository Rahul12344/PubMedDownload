mosquitoes constitute major living beings causing human deaths world. 
they vectors malaria, yellow fever, dengue, zika, filariases, chikungunya,
among diseases. new strategies control/eradicate mosquito populations
are based newly developed genetic manipulation techniques. however, genetic
transformation mosquitoes major technical bottleneck due low
efficiency, need sophisticated equipment, highly trained personnel.
the present report shows transgenerational genetic transformation aedes
aegypti, using particle inflow gun (pig), integrating ecfp gene the
aael000582 mosquito gene crispr-cas9 technique, achieving mean
efficiency 44.5% bombarded individuals (g0) showed ecfp expression 
their tissues, mean 28.5% transformation efficiency measured g1
individuals. transformation technique used integrate the
egfp/scorpine genes cloned minos transposon pminhygegfp anopheles
albimanus genome, achieving mean efficiency 43.25% bombarded individuals 
(g0) showed egfp expression tissues. technique was
standardized, transformation ae. aegypti neonate larvae an. albimanus eggs
was achieved exposed gold microparticle bombardment. integration genes
and heterologous protein expression confirmed pcr, sequencing,
fluorescent microscopy, mass spectrometry, western blot dot blot analyses.
transgenerational inheritance transgenes observed ae. aegypti,
as transformed an. albimanus individuals died pupal stage g0
generation. article protected copyright. rights reserved.
