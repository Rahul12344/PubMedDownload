anopheles sinensis major malaria vector southeast asia. resistance to
pyrethroid insecticides species impeded malaria control the
region. previous studies found an. sinensis populations yunnan
province, china highly resistant deltamethrin carry mutations
in voltage-gated sodium channel gene cause knockdown resistance. this
study, tested hypothesis genomic variants associated with
the resistance phenotype. using paired-end whole genome sequencing (dna-seq), 
generated 108 gb dna sequence deltamethrin -resistant -susceptible
mosquito pools average coverage 83.3× depth. using stringent
filtering method, identified total 916,926 single nucleotide variants
(snvs), including 32,240 non-synonymous mutations. total 958 snvs differed
significantly allele frequency deltamethrin -resistant and
-susceptible mosquitoes. these, 43 snvs present within 37 genes code
for immunity, detoxification, cuticular, odorant proteins. subset 12
snvs randomly selected genotyping individual mosquitoes polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) showed
consistent allele frequencies pooled dna-seq derived allele frequencies.
in addition, copy number variations (cnvs) detected 56 genes, including
33 contained amplification alleles 23 contained deletion alleles in
resistant mosquitoes compared susceptible mosquitoes. genomic variants
described provide useful resource future studies genetic
mechanism insecticide resistance important malaria vector species.
