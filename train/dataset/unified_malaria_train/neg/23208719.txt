plasmodium falciparum mutations associated antimalarial resistance may be
beneficial parasites drug pressure, although may also cause a
fitness cost. herein present vitro model showing combined
effect parasite growth varies drug concentration suggest a
calculated drug-specific cost-benefit index, indicating possible advantage
for mutated parasites. specifically studied d-to-y change position 1246
encoded pfmdr1 gene (pfmdr1 d1246y) relation amodiaquine resistance.
susceptibilities amodiaquine, desethylamodiaquine, chloroquine, well as
relative fitness, determined two modified isogenic p. falciparum clones 
differing pfmdr1 1246 position. data used create new
comparative graph relative growth relation drug concentration to
calculate ratio benefit resistance fitness cost.
results related vivo allele selection analysis amodiaquine or
artesunate-amodiaquine treatment. pfmdr1 1246y associated decreased
susceptibility amodiaquine desethylamodiaquine growth fitness
cost 11%. mutated parasites grew less low drug concentrations due a
predominating fitness cost, beyond breakpoint concentration grew 
due predominating benefit increased resistance. cost-benefit indexes 
indicated pfmdr1 1246y advantageous amodiaquine-exposed
parasites. vivo, first drug selection mutant parasites followed a
fitness selection wild-type parasites supported vitro data. this
cost-benefit model may predict risk selection drug resistance
