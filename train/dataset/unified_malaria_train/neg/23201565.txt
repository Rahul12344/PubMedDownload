in cytoplasm plasmodium falciparum, two peroxiredoxins: pftpx-1 and
pf1-cys-prx, expressed different time-points parasite cell cycle
during intraerythrocytic stage. present study, gain insight into
the functions prxs cytoplasm p. falciparum, investigated heat
stress sensitivity previously established pftpx-1 ko line found that
pftpx-1 disruption renders parasite hypersensitive heat stress. in
addition, established pf1-cys-prx knockout (ko) parasite lines. phenotypes
of pf1-cys-prx ko lines different pftpx-1 ko line did
not show hypersensitivity reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, 
chloroquine heat stress. results suggest function of
pf1-cys-prx parasite cytoplasm independent pftpx-1. the
hyperthermal protective function pftpx-1 obviously important the
parasite physiology human patient body, must survive repeated 
incidences fever.
