background: large body evidence states invasion of
plasmodium vivax requires duffy antigen, universality this
specificity certainly question recent reports showing in
some parts world p. vivax infects causes disease duffy-negative
people. findings reinforce idea parasite rapidly evolving,
being able use receptors duffy invade erythrocytes, which
may enormous impact p. vivax current distribution. presence p. 
vivax infection duffy-negative individuals investigated a
cross-sectional study conducted anajás, archipelago marajó, state pará, 
which area malaria transmission brazilian amazonia.
methods: duffy genotyping plasmodium species diagnostic assays performed
successfully 678 individuals. allele-specific primer polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) technique used duffy blood group genotyping.
identification plasmodium species achieved conventional blood smear
light microscopy taqman-based real-time pcr method detect mitochondrial 
genome plasmodium falciparum p. vivax.
results: plasmodium spp. infection detected 137 samples (20.2%).
prevalence plasmodium species 13.9% p. vivax, 5.8% p. falciparum, and
0.6% p. vivax plus p. falciparum. overall, 4.3% (29/678) genotyped as
duffy-negative (fy*bes/*bes). among duffy-negative individuals 6.9% p. vivax
pcr positive among duffy-positive 14.2% p. vivax pcr positive. although 
lower, risk duffy-negatives experience p. vivax blood stage infection
was significantly different duffy-positives. furthermore, the
genotypic allelic frequencies duffy blood group among p.
vivax-infected patients control group differ significantly,
also suggesting reduction infection rates among carriers fy*bes
allele.
conclusions: data obtained anajás showed differential resistance vivax 
malaria among duffy-negative duffy-positive individuals. result needs
additional confirmation deeper evaluation larger sample of
patients p. vivax malaria molecular parasite characterization.
nonetheless, genetic profile parasite may contributing high
incidence malaria municipality.
