background: insecticides still main method mosquito control, but
mosquito resistance presents large obstacle. function mitochondrial
genes evolution insecticide resistance still poorly understood.
pyrethroid commonly used insecticide, anopheles sinensis an
important malaria vector china southeast asia. study, we
investigated mitochondrial genes associated pyrethroid resistance
through genetic expression variation based analyses of
transcriptomes 36 individuals resequencing three geographical
populations china.
results: nucleotide diversity (pi) 18 resistant individuals much lower
than 18 susceptible individuals, suggests sites
experienced purifying selection subject pyrethroid stress. ka/ks amino
acid analyses showed nd4 experienced positive selection 23 amino
acid mutations due pyrethroid stress. mutations might change nd4
structure function thus alter efficiency respiratory chain.
nd5 significantly upregulated, atp8 significantly downregulated in
these three pyrethroid resistant populations, suggests two genes
function production maintenance pyrethroid resistance. are
differences mitochondrial genes involved pyrethroid resistance among 
three populations.
conclusion: first study reveal association mitochondrial
genes evolution insecticide resistance amino acid mutation 
expression patterns help us understand insecticide resistance
