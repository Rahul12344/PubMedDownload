background: malaria control heavily relies insecticide-based interventions
against mosquito vectors. however, increasing spread insecticide
resistance major threat. extent resistance, notably
metabolic resistance, interferes development plasmodium parasite 
and impact overall malaria transmission remains poorly characterized.
here, investigated whether glutathione s-transferase-based resistance could
influence plasmodium falciparum development anopheles funestus. methods:
anopheles funestus females infected p. falciparum gametocytes and
midguts dissected day 7 post infection detection/quantification of
oocysts. infection parameters compared individual different
l119f-gste2 genotypes, polymorphism gste2 gene analyzed in
infected uninfected mosquito groups. results: overall, 403 mosquitoes were
dissected genotyped. frequency l119f-gste2 resistance allele was
significantly higher non-infected (55.88%) compared infected (40.99%)
mosquitoes (fisher's exact test, p<0.0001). prevalence infection was
significantly higher heterozygous homozygous susceptible genotypes
(p<0.001). however, homozygous resistant heterozygous mosquitoes exhibited
significantly higher infection intensity (p<0.01). association observed
between gste2 polymorphism infection status mosquitoes.
conclusion: altogether, results suggest gste2-based metabolic
resistance may affect vectorial competence resistant an. funestus
mosquitoes p. falciparum infection, increasing permissiveness to
plasmodium infection.
