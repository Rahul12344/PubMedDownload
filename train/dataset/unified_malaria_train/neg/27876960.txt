an investigation done find role gut bacterium larval
development survival anopheles subpictus, vector responsible the
transmission malaria. an. subpictus mosquitoes breed exclusively stagnant
water, including shrimp/fish ponds high nutrient level. one bacterial strain
(cx2) isolated midgut late third instar mosquito larvae. the
bacterial isolate sensitive recommended doses tetracyclin (30 µg/disc),
doxycycline (30 µg/disc), kanamycin (30 µg/disc), gentamycin (10 µg/disc),
streptomycin (10 µg/disc), vancomycin (30 µg/disc), ofloxacin (5 µg/disc),
levofloxacin (5 µg/disc), gatifloxacin (10 µg/disc), resistant ampicillin 
(10 µg/disc).the larvae fed mixture two antibiotics
tetracylin (30 µg/disc) doxycyclin (30 µg/disc) (1:1) could survive in
rice-field water. control experiments without antibiotic treatment,
95-100 % survival 95 % adult emergence observed. study indicates
that elimination gut bacteria suppressed larval growth. phylogenetic
analysis 16s rrna gene sequence also done. based morphological,
biochemical, fame analysis phylogenetic analysis, bacterial isolate cx2
was identified bacillus cereus. poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis
revealed isolate showed discrete bands ranging 24.272 60.049 kda
proteins. water extract methanol extract tamarindus indica showed
inhibitory effect b. cereus.
