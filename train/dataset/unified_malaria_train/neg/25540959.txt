background & objectives: resistance partner drugs artemisinin been
reported different parts india. study aims find single
nucleotide polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum atpase6 gene associated with
artemisinin resistance.
methods: blood samples collected 141 patients p. falciparum
monoinfection malaria endemic zones assam arunachal pradesh. 645 bp
portion pfatpase6 gene amplified sequenced determine frequency 
of mutations associated resistance artemisinin.
results: mutations codon s769n, proposed confer artemisinin
resistance, detected study samples. instead novel
non-synonymous mutation (c-t) 1847 bp position resulting serine to
phenylalanine alteration codon s616f detected p. falciparum field
isolates changlang district arunachal pradesh, whereas mutation was
detected analyzed samples assam indicating wild type
pfatpase6 genotype found circulating region. overall, based the
mutational pattern, two haplotypes pfatpase6 gene observed the
study, wild type mutant s616f allele. overall haplotype diversity
(hd) found be: 0.069 nucleotide diversity (per site pi): 0.00012.
highest haplotype diversity recorded changlang district arunachal
pradesh hd value 0.33333 along single polymorphic site and
nucleotide diversity (pi): 0.00060. pair-wise fixation index (fst) value of
0.16667 indicates great genetic differentiation within parasite population of
changlang district population karbi anglong, chirang, tinsukia,
sivasagar, jorhat, nc hills, lakhimpur, golaghat dibrugarh districts assam
and lohit district arunachal pradesh.
interpretation & conclusion: better understanding distribution of
antimalarial drug resistance malaria parasite may provide insight 
of epidemiological determinants increasing case burden.
