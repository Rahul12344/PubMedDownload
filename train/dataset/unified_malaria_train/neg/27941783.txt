alignment first step rna-seq analysis pipelines, accuracy 
of downstream analyses depends heavily it. unlike steps pipeline, 
alignment particularly amenable benchmarking simulated data. we
performed comprehensive benchmarking 14 common splice-aware aligners for
base, read, exon junction-level accuracy compared default optimized 
parameters. found performance varied genome complexity, accuracy
and popularity poorly correlated. widely cited tool underperforms
for metrics, particularly using default settings.
