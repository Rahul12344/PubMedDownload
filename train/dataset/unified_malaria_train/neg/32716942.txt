owing increased reports aedes-borne diseases caribbean latin
america, united states agency international development assisted the
jamaican ministry health wellness conducting insecticide susceptibility
tests aedes aegypti populations. sentinel sites established seven
parishes jamaica (st. catherine, kingston st. andrew, st. thomas,
portland, st. mary st. ann) aedes aegypti eggs collected, reared 
adults per collected population susceptibility varying pyrethroids
and organophosphates tested using world health organization paper
bioassays insecticides. centers disease control prevention 
bottle bioassay used assess susceptibility carbamate, bendiocarb.
the voltage gated sodium channel gene mutations v1016i i1011v, normally
associated pyrethroid resistance, also analysed. results showed
that aedes aegypti collected parishes exhibited resistance to
pyrethroids following concentrations, permethrin 0.25-2.5%; deltamethrin
0.03-0.15%; lambda-cyhalothrin 0.03-0.3%; etofenprox 0.5-2.5%. the
insecticide deltamethrin concentration 0.3% pyrethroid tested
that resulted high mortality, 94.9 ± 0.34% knockdown within 1 hour exposure
and 98.95 ± 0.01% mortality (p <0.01) 24 hours post exposure. frequency of
the voltage gated sodium channel gene mutation v1016i high tested
population, possibly accounting reduced sensitivity pyrethroids.
organophosphate resistance also observed populations tested. mortality
rates 0.8% malathion 0.8 ± 0.70-60.68 ± 0.38% 24 hour and
0.00-47.10 ± 3.02%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.21%. bendiocarb applied 12.5 μg/
bottle resulted mortality rates 76.25 ± 4.30-100 ± 0.00% 30 minutes
of exposure. results showed ae. aegypti seven parishes analysed
demonstrated resistance insecticides tested. deltamethrin bendiocarb
at concentrations 0.3% 12.5μg respectively, considered effective,
causing high mortality local populations. routine monitoring and
evaluations ae. aegypti populations included parishes are
recommended. additionally, study results represent comprehensive
testing date local aedes aegypti populations distributed across different
parishes jamaica useful guide national sub national
strategies vector control surveillance.
