the adoption artemisinin based combination therapies (act) constitutes basic
strategy malaria control sub-saharan africa. moreover, since cases act 
resistance reported south-east asia, need understand p.
falciparum resistance mechanism act become global research goal. the
selective pressure act possibility specific pfcrt pfmdr1
alleles associated treatment failures assessed clinical trial
comparing asaq al nanoro. dried blood spots collected day 0 the
day recurrent parasitaemia 28-day follow-up analyzed using the
restriction fragments length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) method detect single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pfcrt (codon76) pfmdr1 (codons 86, 184,
1034, 1042, 1246) genes. multivariate analysis relationship between
the presence pfcrt pfmdr1 alleles treatment outcome performed. al 
and asaq exerted opposite trends selecting pfcrt k76t pfmdr1-n86y alleles,
raising potential beneficial effect using diverse act time 
first line treatments reduce selective pressure treatment regimen.
no clear association presence pfcrt pfmdr1 alleles carried 
baseline treatment failure observed.
