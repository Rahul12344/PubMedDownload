imported malaria great challenge public health china due to
decreased locally transmitted cases frequent exchange worldwide. plasmodium
falciparum mainly responsible increasing impact. currently,
artesunate plus amodiaquine, one artemisinin combination therapies
recommended world health organization, mainly used against
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria china. however, drug resistance marker
polymorphism returning migrant workers demonstrated. here, we
have evaluated prevalence pfmdr1 pfcrt polymorphisms, well the
k13 propeller gene, molecular marker artemisinin resistance, migrant
workers returned ghana shanglin county, guangxi province, china, 2013.
a total 118 blood samples randomly selected used assay.
mutations pfmdr1 gene covered codons 86, 184, 1034, 1246 were
found 11 isolates. mutations codon n86y (9.7%) frequent at
others, y(86)y(184)s(1034)d(1246) prevalent (63.6%) four 
haplotypes. mutations pfcrt gene covered codons 74, 75, 76 were
observed 17 isolates, m(74)n(75)t(76) common (70.6%) three
haplotypes. eight different genotypes k13 propeller first observed in
10 samples china, 2 synonymous mutations (v487v a627a) 6 nonsynonymous
mutations. c580y prevalent (2.7%) samples. data
presented might helpful enrichment molecular surveillance of
antimalarial resistance useful developing updating
antimalarial guidance china.
