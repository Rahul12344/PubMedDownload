malaria significant cause morbidity mortality worldwide. this
disease, primarily affects living tropical subtropical
regions, caused infection plasmodium parasites. development of
more effective drugs combat malaria accelerated improving our
understanding biology complex parasite. genetic manipulation of
these parasites key understanding biology; however, historically 
genome p. falciparum difficult manipulate. recently, crispr/cas9
genome editing utilized malaria parasites, allowing easier
protein tagging, generation conditional protein knockdowns, deletion of
genes. crispr/cas9 genome editing proven powerful tool advancing 
the field malaria research. here, describe crispr/cas9 method for
generating glms-based conditional knockdown mutants p. falciparum. method
is highly adaptable types genetic manipulations, including protein
tagging gene knockouts.
