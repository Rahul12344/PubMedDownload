cerebral malaria (cm) severe neurological complication malaria infection 
in adults children. pursuit effective treatment cm, clinical
studies, postmortem analysis animal models employed understand
the pathology identify effective interventions. study, shotgun
proteomics analysis conducted profile proteomic signature brain
tissue mice experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) order further
understand underlying pathology. identify cm-associated response,
proteomic signatures brains c57/bl6n mice infected p. berghei anka
that developed neurological syndrome compared mice infected with
p. berghei nk65 developed equally high parasite burdens without neurological
signs, non-infected mice. results show cm-associated
response mice developed neurological signs comprise mainly acute-phase
reaction coagulation cascade activation, indicate leakage plasma
proteins brain parenchyma.significance: cerebral malaria (cm) remains 
major cause death children. majority deaths occur in
sub-saharan africa. even adequate access treatment, mortality remains
high neurological sequelae found 20% survivors. no
adjuvant treatment date shown reduce mortality the
pathophysiology cm largely unknown. experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) 
a well-established model may contribute identify test druggable
