methionine aminopeptidases (metaps), ubiquitous enzymes play important
role nascent protein maturation, recognized attractive targets
for development drugs pathogenic protozoa including plasmodium
spp. here, characterized partial biochemical properties type metap of
plasmodium vivax (pvmetap1). pvmetap1 typical amino acid residues
essential metal binding substrate binding sites, well conserved
in type metap family enzymes. recombinant pvmetap1 showed activity a
broad range neutral phs, optimum activity ph 7.5. pvmetap1 stable 
under neutral alkaline phs, relatively unstable acidic
conditions. pvmetap1 activity highly increased presence mn(2+), and
was effectively inhibited metal chelator, edta. fumagillin and
aminopeptidase inhibitors, amastatin bestatin, also showed inhibitory
effect pvmetap1. enzyme highly specific hydrolytic activity for
n-terminal methionine. results collectively suggest pvmetap1 belongs
to family type metaps may play pivotal role maintenance of
p. vivax physiology mediating protein maturation processing the
parasite.
