background: calcium (ca²⁺) signalling fundamental host cell invasion,
motility, vivo synchronicity sexual differentiation malaria
parasite. consequently, cytoplasmic free ca²⁺ tightly regulated the
co-ordinated action primary secondary ca²⁺ transporters. identifying
selective inhibitors ca²⁺ transporters key towards understanding their
physiological role well therapeutic potential, therefore screening
systems facilitate search potential inhibitors priority. here,
the methodology expression calcium membrane transporter 
scaled high throughputs yeast presented.
methods: plasmodium falciparum ca²⁺/h⁺ antiporter (pfcha) expressed in
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae activity monitored the
bioluminescence apoaequorin triggered divalent cations, calcium, 
magnesium manganese.
results: bioluminescence assays demonstrated pfcha effectively suppressed
induced cytoplasmic peaks ca²⁺, mg²⁺ mn²⁺ yeast mutants lacking the
homologue yeast antiporter vcx1p. scalable format 96-well culture
plates pharmacological assays cation antiporter inhibitor allowed the
measurement inhibition ca²⁺ transport activity pfcha conveniently
translated familiar concept fractional inhibitory concentrations.
furthermore, cytolocalization antiporter yeast cells showed
that whilst pfcha seems locate mitochondrion p. falciparum, yeast
pfcha sorted vacuole. facilitates real-time ca²⁺-loading
assays functional pharmacological studies.
discussion: functional expression pfcha s. cerevisiae and
luminescence-based detection cytoplasmic cations presented offer a
tractable system facilitates functional pharmacological studies a
high-throughput format. pfcha shown behave divalent cation/h⁺
antiporter susceptible effects cation/h⁺ inhibitors kb-r7943.
this type gene expression systems advance efforts screening
of potential inhibitors type divalent cation transporters part of
the malaria drug discovery initiatives functional studies general.
conclusion: expression activity pfcha detected yeast a
bioluminescence assay follows levels cytoplasmic ca²⁺ well mg²⁺
and mn²⁺ lend high-throughput quantitative settings for
pharmacological screening functional studies.
