background: identification parasite genes underlie traits drug
resistance host specificity challenging using classical linkage mapping
approaches. extreme qtl (x-qtl) methods, originally developed rodent malaria
and yeast researchers, promise increase power simplify logistics of
linkage mapping experimental crosses schistosomes (or helminth
parasites), many 1000s progeny analysed, phenotyping not
required, progeny pools rather individuals genotyped. explored
the utility method mapping drug resistance gene human
parasitic fluke schistosoma mansoni.
results: staged genetic cross oxamniquine sensitive resistant
parasites, two f1 progeny, generate multiple f2 progeny. one
group f2s infecting hamsters treated oxamniquine, second
group left untreated. used exome capture reduce size genome 
(from 363 mb 15 mb) exomes pooled f2 progeny (treated males,
untreated males, treated females, untreated females) two parent parasites
were sequenced high read depth (mean = 95-366×) allele frequencies at
14,489 variants compared. observed dramatic enrichment alleles the
resistant parent small region chromosome 6 drug-treated male and
female pools (combined analysis: z = 11.07, p = 8.74 × 10(-29)). region
contains smp_089320 gene encoding sulfotransferase recently implicated in
oxamniquine resistance using classical linkage mapping methods.
conclusions: results (a) demonstrate utility exome capture for
generating reduced representation libraries schistosoma mansoni, (b)
provide proof-of-principle x-qtl methods successfully applied an
important human helminth. combination methods simplify linkage 
analysis biomedically biologically important traits parasite.
