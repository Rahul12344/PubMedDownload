malaria parasites different areas malaria endemic display different
levels resistance antimalarial drugs result varied drug use
histories. provide updated knowledge drug sensitivities malaria 
elimination phase southeast asia, epicenter multidrug resistance, we
determined vitro susceptibilities culture-adapted plasmodium falciparum
isolates two eastern border regions (wa kachin) myanmar 10 drugs. 
despite close proximity, kachin parasites displayed higher 50%
inhibitory concentrations wa parasites chloroquine, piperaquine,
naphthoquine, mefloquine, quinine, pyrimethamine, pyronaridine, lumefantrine, and
dihydroartemisinin. genotyping genes associated drug resistance also
showed significant differences prevalence rates mutant alleles 
the two regions. particularly, major pfdhfr mutations mediating pyrimethamine
resistance pfdhps a437g mutation significantly higher frequencies 
the kachin parasites (p < 0.005). moreover, pfdhfr pfdhps were
considered together, wild-type allele found wa samples
(22.6%). addition, pfmdr1 y184f mutation reached 38.7% kachin
parasites, compared 9.7% wa parasites, whereas n86y detected
in wa parasites, 22.6%. furthermore, f446i mutation mutations 
in propeller domain pfk13 gene significantly frequent the
kachin parasites. collectively, work demonstrates even spatially
closely separated regions, parasites exhibit drastic differences drug
sensitivities genetic makeups underlying drug resistance, may reflect
regionally different drug histories genetic drift isolated parasite 
populations.
