plasmodium falciparum, deadliest species malaria parasites, dependent
on glycolysis generation atp pathogenic red blood cell
stage. hexokinase (hk) catalyzes first step glycolysis, transferring the
γ-phosphoryl group atp glucose yield glucose-6-phosphate. here, we
describe validation high-throughput assay screening small-molecule
collections identify inhibitors p. falciparum hk (pfhk). assay,
which employed adp-glo reporter system 1,536-well-plate format, was
robust signal-to-background ratio 3.4 ± 1.2, coefficient variation
of 6.8% ± 2.9%, z'-factor 0.75 ± 0.08. using assay, screened
57,654 molecules multiple small-molecule collections. confirmed hits were
resolved four clusters basis structural relatedness. multiple
singleton hits also identified. potent inhibitors 50%
inhibitory concentrations low ∼1 μm, several found have
low-micromolar 50% effective concentrations asexual
intraerythrocytic-stage p. falciparum parasites. molecules additionally
demonstrated limited toxicity panel mammalian cells. the
identification pfhk inhibitors antiparasitic activity using this
validated screening assay encouraging, justifies additional hts
campaigns structurally amenable libraries identification of
potential leads future therapeutic development.
