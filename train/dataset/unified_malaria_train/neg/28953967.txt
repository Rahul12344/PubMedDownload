many chronic infections, including malaria hiv, associated large
expansion cd21-cd27- 'atypical' memory b cells (mbcs) exhibit reduced b
cell receptor (bcr) signaling effector functions. little known the
conditions transcriptional regulators driving atypical mbc differentiation.
here show atypical mbcs malaria-exposed individuals highly express the
transcription factor t-bet, t-bet expression correlates inversely with
bcr signaling skews toward igg3 class switching. moreover, longitudinal
analysis subset children suggested correlation incidence of
febrile malaria expansion t-bethi b cells. th1-cytokine containing
supernatants malaria-stimulated pbmcs plus bcr cross linking induced t-bet
expression naïve b cells abrogated neutralizing ifn-γ blocking 
the ifn-γ receptor b cells. accordingly, recombinant ifn-γ plus bcr
cross-linking drove t-bet expression peripheral tonsillar b cells.
consistent this, th1-polarized tfh (tfh-1) cells efficiently induced
t-bet expression naïve b cells. data provide new insight the
mechanisms underlying atypical mbc differentiation.
