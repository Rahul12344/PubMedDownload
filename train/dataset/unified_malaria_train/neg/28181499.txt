understanding molecular defense mechanism macrophages identifying
their effector molecules malarial parasites may provide important clues
for discovery new therapies. analyze immunological responses of
malarial parasite-induced macrophages, used dna microarray technology to
examine gene profile differentiated macrophages phagocytizing plasmodium
falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (irbc). transcriptional gene profile of
macrophages response irbcs represented 168 down-regulated genes, were
mainly involved cellular immune response, 216 upregulated genes, which
were involved cellular proteolysis, growth, adhesion. importantly, the
specific upregulation β-defensin 130 (defb130) macrophages suggested 
a possible role defb130 malarial parasite elimination. differentiated
macrophages phagocytizing irbcs exhibited increase intracellular defb130
levels defb130 appeared accumulate site irbc engulfment.
transfection esirna-mediated knockdown defb130 macrophages resulted in
a remarkable reduction antiplasmodial activity vitro. furthermore,
defb130 synthetic peptide exhibited modest toxic effect p. falciparum in
vitro p. yoelii vivo, unlike scrambled defb130 peptide, showed no
antiplasmodial activity. together, results suggest defb130 might be
one macrophage effector molecules eliminating malarial parasites. 
data broaden knowledge immunological response macrophages irbcs 
and shed light new target therapeutic intervention.
