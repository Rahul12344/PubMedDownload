plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance constitutes major obstacle the
global malaria elimination campaign. specific mutations plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) mediate resistance the
4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine impact parasite susceptibility several
partner agents used current artemisinin-based combination therapies, including
amodiaquine. examining gene-edited parasites, report ability of
the wide-spread dd2 pfcrt isoform mediate chloroquine amodiaquine
resistance substantially reduced addition pfcrt l272f mutation, 
which arose blasticidin selection. also provide evidence l272f
confers significant fitness cost asexual blood stage parasites. studies with
amino acid-restricted media identify mutant methionine auxotroph.
metabolomic analysis also reveals accumulation short, hemoglobin-derived
peptides dd2 + l272f dd2 isoforms, compared parasites expressing 
wild-type pfcrt. physiologic studies ionophores monensin nigericin
support impact pfcrt isoforms ca2+ release, substantially reduced
ca2+ levels observed dd2 + l272f parasites. data reveal central role for
pfcrt regulating hemoglobin catabolism, amino acid availability, ionic
balance p. falciparum, addition role determining parasite
susceptibility heme-binding 4-aminoquinoline drugs.
