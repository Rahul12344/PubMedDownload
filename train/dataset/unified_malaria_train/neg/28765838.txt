understanding molecular basis mosquito behavioural complexity plays a
central role designing novel molecular tools fight their
vector-borne diseases. although olfactory system plays important role in
guiding managing many behavioural responses including feeding mating, but
the sex-specific regulation olfactory responses remain poorly investigated.
from ongoing transcriptomic data annotation olfactory tissue blood fed 
adult female an. culicifacies mosquitoes; identified 383 bp long unique
transcript encoding drosophila homolog quick-to-court protein.
previously shown regulate courtship behaviour adult male
drosophila. comprehensive silico analysis quick-to-court (qtc) gene
of an. culicifacies (ac-qtc) predicts 1536 bp single copy gene encoding 511
amino acid protein, high degree conservation insect
homologs. age-dependent increased expression putative ac-qtc correlated
with maturation olfactory system, necessary meet sex-specific
conflicting demand mating (mate finding) versus host-seeking behavioural
responses. sixteen eighteen hours starvation alter ac-qtc
expression sexes, however, blood feeding significantly modulated its
response adult female mosquitoes, confirming may involved
in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. finally, dual behavioural
and molecular assay indicated natural dysregulation ac-qtc late
evening might promote mating events successful insemination. we
hypothesize ac-qtc may play unique role regulate sex-specific
conflicting demand mosquito courtship behaviour versus blood feeding behaviour
in adult female mosquitoes. elucidation molecular mechanism
may provide information evaluate ac-qtc key molecular target 
mosquito-borne disease management.
