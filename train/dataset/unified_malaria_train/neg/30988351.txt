pfemp1 family adhesive proteins expressed surface plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies), mediate adhesion ies a
range host receptors. efficient pfemp1-dependent ie sequestration often
depends soluble serum proteins, including igm. here, report comprehensive
investigation 60 var gene-encoded pfemp1 variants per
parasite genome bind igm via fc part antibody molecule, 
of constituent domains pfemp1 involved. erased epigenetic
memory var gene expression three distinct p. falciparum clones, 3d7, hb3,
and it4/fcr3 promoter titration, isolated individual ies binding igm 
from malaria-unexposed individuals fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting.
the var gene transcription profiles sub-clones measured real-time qpcr were
used identify potential igm-binding pfemp1 variants. recombinant dbl cidr 
domains corresponding variants tested elisa protein arrays
to confirm igm-binding capacity. selected dbl domains used raise
specific rat anti-sera select ies uniform expression candidate pfemp1 
proteins. data document igm-binding pfemp1 proteins common each
of three clones studied, binding epitopes mainly found in
dblε dblζ domains near c-terminus.
