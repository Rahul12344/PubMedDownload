helicases catalyze unwinding double stranded nucleic acids an
energy-dependent manner. reported characterization uvrd helicase 
plasmodium falciparum. reported n-terminal c-terminal fragments
of pfuvrd contain characteristic atpase dna helicase activities. we
report generation characterization genetically engineered version of
pfuvrd derivatives. synthetic uvrd (sud) contains conserved 
domains pfuvrd intervening linker sequences shortened. sud (∼
45 kda) one smallest derivative sudn1n2 (∼ 22 kda) contain atpase 
dna helicase activities. sud sudn1n2 utilize hydrolysis ntps
and dntps, also unwind blunt end duplex dna substrate unwind dna duplex
in 3 5 direction only. properties sud similar pfuvrd
helicase. mutagenesis conserved motif ia indicate mutants sudm
and sudn1n2m lose enzyme activities, confirms these
activities intrinsic synthesized proteins. studies show for
helicase activity conserved domains essentially required and
intervening sequences almost role. observations aid in
understanding unwinding mechanism helicase.
