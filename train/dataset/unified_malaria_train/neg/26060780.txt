background: detection plasmodium vivax specific antibodies serological
tests could valuable tool epidemiological researches. whereas p. vivax
cannot simply obtained vitro, serological tests using total or
semi-purified antigens infrequently used. given restriction, present
study investigated whether recombinant p. vivax merozoite surface protein 1
(pvmsp-1 42 kda) could useful detection antibodies serums 
p. vivax infected person using serological tests.
methods: parasite dna extracted blood sample iranian p.
vivax-infected patient. region pvmsp-142 kda amplified pcr then
cloned ptz57r/t vector sequenced. insert sub cloned pgex
6p1 expression vector. afterwards, transformed e. coli bl21 and
cultured massively. sub cloning gene confirmed pcr enzyme digestion
and sequencing finally. production recombinant protein confirmed by
sds-page. western blot performed human sera appraisal binding ability
to igg antibodies p. vivax infected patients. recombinant protein was
purified estimated bradford assay.
results: specialty values western blot determined 10 sera from
naturally infected individuals, 10 sera healthy individuals 7 sera 
individuals infectious diseases.
conclusion: iranian population, using western blot assay msp-142
recombinant protein used foundation promotion serological
assay detection p. vivax malaria elisa.
