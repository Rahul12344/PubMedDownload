we attempted identify plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3
(pfhrp2/3) deletions among rapid diagnostic test (rdt)-negative pcr- or
microscopy-positive p. falciparum-infected individuals areas low
transmission (choma district, 2009-2011) high transmission (nchelenge
district, 2015-2017) zambia. community-based surveys, 5,167
participants screened 1,147 households p. falciparum histidine-rich
protein 2 (pfhrp2)-based rdts. slides made dried blood spots were
obtained molecular analysis. 28 samples detectable p. falciparum dna,
none nchelenge district pfhrp2/3 negative. eight samples choma
district detectable pfhrp3 genes, pfhrp2 undetectable three. dna
concentrations pfhrp2-negative samples low (< 0.001 ng/Î¼l). these
findings suggest pfhrp2-based rdts remain effective tools malaria
diagnosis nchelenge district, study warranted understand the
potential pfhrp2/3 deletions southern zambia malaria transmission
declined past decade.
