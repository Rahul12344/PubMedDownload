background: develop plant-based vaccine plasmodium vivax, two p.
vivax candidate proteins chosen. first, merozoite surface protein-1
(msp-1), major asexual blood stage antigen currently considered a
strong vaccine candidate. second, circumsporozoite protein (csp), component
of sporozoites contains b-cell epitope.
methods: synthetic chimeric recombinant 516 bp gene encoding containing
pvmsp-1, pro-gly linker motif, pvcsp synthesized; gene, named mlc, 
encoded total 172 amino acids. recombinant gene modified regard
to codon usage optimize gene expression brassica napus. ti plasmid
inducible gene transfer system used mlc chimeric recombinant gene
expression b. napus. gene expression confirmed polymerase chain
reaction (pcr), beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (gus) assay, western blot.
results: mlc chimeric recombinant protein expressed b. napus a
molecular weight approximately 25 kda. exhibited clinical sensitivity 
84.21% (n=38) clinical specificity 100% (n=24) assessed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). oral immunization balb/c mice 
mlc chimeric recombinant protein successfully induced antigen-specific igg1
production. additionally, th1-related cytokines il-12 (p40), tnf, ifn-Î³
were significantly increased spleens balb/c mice.
conclusions: chimeric mlc recombinant protein produced b. napus has
potential antigen diagnosis valuable vaccine candidate
for oral immunization vivax malaria.
