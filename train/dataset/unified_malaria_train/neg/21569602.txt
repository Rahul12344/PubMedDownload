background: plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein pf38 targeted 
by antibodies malaria immune adults shown balancing
(immune) selection gambian parasite population, indicating potential a
malaria vaccine candidate. study explores population genetics pf38 in
papua new guinea, determine extent geographic distribution of
diversity measure selective pressure along length gene.
methods: using samples collected community-based cross-sectional surveys
in mugil wosera regions, pf38 genes 59 p. falciparum isolates were
amplified sequenced. sequences, along previously sequenced gambian
and laboratory isolates, subjected array population genetic
analyses, examining polymorphisms, haplotype diversity balancing selection.
in addition whole-gene analysis, two 6-cys domains considered
separately, investigate domain specific polymorphism selection.
results: nineteen polymorphic sites identified pf 38 gene. these, 
13 found gambia, 10 mugil 8 wosera. notably, majority
of common polymorphisms confined domain i. although moderate levels 
of nucleotide diversity observed, haplotype diversity high all
populations, suggesting extensive recombination. analyses full-length
sequence provided modest evidence balancing selection. however, there
was strong contrast domain i, showed strong evidence positive
balancing selection, domain ii neutral. analyses geographic 
distribution pf38 haplotypes showed four haplotypes accounted the
majority sequences found world-wide, many haplotypes
unique african png populations.
conclusion: study confirmed previous findings pf38 polymorphic
gene balancing selection. however, analysing polymorphism selection
across length gene painted considerably different picture. domain 
is highly polymorphic target significant balancing selection. in
contrast, domain ii relatively conserved show evidence immune 
selective pressure. findings implications future population genetic 
studies vaccine candidates, showing biological context must also be
considered framework analysis.
