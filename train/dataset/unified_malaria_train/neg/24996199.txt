infection malaria parasites imposed strong selective pressure the
human genome, promoting convergent evolution diverse range genetic
adaptations, many harboured red blood cell, hosts the
pathogenic stage plasmodium life cycle. recent genome-wide and
multi-centre association studies severe malaria consistently identified
atp2b4, encoding major ca(2+) pump erythrocytes, novel resistance
locus. evidence also accumulating interaction occurs among resistance
loci, recent example negative epistasis among alpha-thalassemia
and haptoglobin type 2. finally, studies effect haemoglobin c 
parasite transmission mosquitoes suggested protective variants could
increase frequency enhancing parasite fitness.
