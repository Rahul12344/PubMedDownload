background: drug resistance within major malaria parasites plasmodium vivax
and plasmodium falciparum threatens malaria control elimination southeast 
asia. plasmodium vivax first-line treatment drug chloroquine together with
primaquine, first-line treatment p. falciparum malaria artemisinin
in combination partner drug. plasmodium vivax p. falciparum parasites 
resistant respective first-line therapies found within southeast
asia. resistance perimeters may include high transmission regions southern
thailand underrepresented surveillance efforts.
methods: study investigated blood samples malaria centres southern
thailand. genetic loci associated drug resistance amplified and
sequenced. drug resistance associated genes pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhfr, pvdhps
were characterized 145 cases p. vivax malaria, well artemisinin 
resistance-associated pfkelch13 gene 91 cases p. falciparum malaria.
results: plasmodium vivax samples southern thai provinces showed numerous
chloroquine antifolate resistance-associated mutations, including snp and
pvcrt-o k10-insertion combinations suggestive chloroquine resistant p. vivax
phenotypes. high proportion c580y coding mutation (conferring
artemisinin resistance) detected p. falciparum samples originating from
ranong yala (where mutation previously unreported).
conclusions: results demonstrate risk chloroquine antifolate
resistant p. vivax phenotypes southern thailand, artemisinin resistant p. 
falciparum observed far south thai-malaysian border region. ongoing
surveillance antimalarial drug resistance markers called southern
thailand inform case management.
