background: anti-malarial drug resistance continues leading threat to
malaria control efforts calls continued monitoring waning efficacy 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act).
artesunate + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (as + sp) used treatment of
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria india. however, resistance against
as + sp emerged northeastern states. therefore, artemether-lumefantrine
(al) recommended first line treatment falciparum malaria north
eastern states. study investigates therapeutic efficacy safety al
for treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria three malaria-endemic
states india. data generated study benefit immediate
implementation second-line act required.
methods: one-arm prospective evaluation clinical and
parasitological responses uncomplicated falciparum malaria using who
protocol. patients diagnosed uncomplicated mono p. falciparum infection were
administered six-dose regimen al 3 days subsequent follow-up was
carried 28 days. molecular markers msp-1 msp-2 used to
differentiate recrudescence re-infection k13 propeller gene amplified
and sequenced covering codon 450-680.
results: total 402 eligible patients enrolled study all
four sites. overall, adequate clinical parasitological response (acpr) was
98 % without pcr correction 99 % pcr correction. three study sites,
acpr rates 100 %, bastar, cure rate 92.5 % day 28. early 
treatment failure found. pcr-corrected endpoint finding confirmed that
one late clinical failure (lcf) two late parasitological failures (lpf) 
recrudescences. pcr corrected cure rate 96.5 %. mean fever clearance 
time 27.2 h ± 8.2 (24-48 h) mean parasite clearance time was
30.1 h ± 11.0 (24-72 h). additionally, adverse event recorded. analysis of
total 186 samples revealed mutation k13 gene along non-synonymous
mutation codon m579t three (1.6 %) samples.
conclusion: al efficacious drug treatment uncomplicated
falciparum malaria. however, regular monitoring al required view of
malaria elimination initiatives, largely dependent therapeutic
interventions, regular surveillance targeted vector control.
