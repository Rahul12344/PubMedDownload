in hiv infection, persistent inflammation despite effective antiretroviral
therapy linked increased risk noninfectious chronic complications such
as cardiovascular thromboembolic disease. better understanding of
inflammatory coagulation pathways hiv infection needed optimize
clinical care. markers monocyte activation coagulation independently
predict morbidity mortality associated non-aids events. identified 
specific subset monocytes express tissue factor (tf), persist after
virological suppression, trigger coagulation cascade activating factor
x. subset monocytes expressing tf distinct gene signature with
up-regulated innate immune markers evidence robust production multiple 
proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (il-1β), tumor necrosis
factor-α (tnf-α), il-6, ex vivo vitro upon lipopolysaccharide
stimulation. validated findings nonhuman primate model, showing 
tf-expressing inflammatory monocytes associated simian immunodeficiency
virus (siv)-related coagulopathy progressive [pigtail macaques (ptms)] but
not nonpathogenic (african green monkeys) siv infection model. last,
ixolaris, anticoagulant inhibits tf pathway, tested potently 
blocked functional tf activity vitro hiv siv infection without
affecting monocyte responses toll-like receptor stimulation. strikingly, in
vivo treatment siv-infected ptms ixolaris associated significant
decreases d-dimer immune activation. data suggest tf-expressing
monocytes epicenter inflammation coagulation chronic hiv and
siv infection may represent potential therapeutic target.
