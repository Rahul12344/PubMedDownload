apicomplexan parasites cause variety important infectious diseases,
including malaria, toxoplasma encephalitis, severe diarrhea due to
cryptosporidium apicomplexans depend organelle called apicoplast
which derived red algal endosymbiont. apicoplast essential for
the parasite compartment fatty acid, heme, isoprenoid biosynthesis.
the majority approximate 500 apicoplast proteins nucleus encoded and
have imported across four membranes surround apicoplast.
import across second outermost membrane apicoplast, periplastid
membrane, depends apicoplast-specific endoplasmic reticulum-associated
protein degradation (erad) complex enzymes associated
ubiquitination cascade. however, identification apicoplast ubiquitin
associated machinery long elusive. identify plastid 
ubiquitin-like protein (publ), apicoplast protein derived a
ubiquitin ancestor significantly changed primary sequence.
publ distinct known ubiquitin-like proteins, phylogenomic analyses
suggest clade specific apicomplexans. demonstrate publ aaa
atpase cdc48ap act translocate apicoplast proteins across periplastid
membrane protein import. conditional null mutants genetic
complementation show proteins critical process for
parasite survival. publ residues homologous required for
ubiquitin conjugation onto target proteins essential function, while
those required polyubiquitination preprotein processing dispensable. 
our experiments provide mechanistic understanding molecular machinery
that drives protein import across membranes apicoplast.importance
apicomplexan parasites responsible important human diseases. no
effective vaccines use humans, drug treatment faces multiple
challenges, including emerging resistance, lack efficacy across lifecycle,
and adverse drug effects. apicoplast promising target novel
treatments: chloroplast-like organelle derived algal symbiont, is
absent host, essential parasite growth pathogenesis. we
use toxoplasma gondii model study apicoplast due strong
genetic tools established functional assays. identify plastid
ubiquitin-like protein (publ) novel ubiquitin-like protein and
demonstrate importance motor protein cdc48ap apicoplast
protein import. findings broaden understanding evolution and
mechanistic workings unique parasite organelle may lead new
opportunities treatments important human pathogens.
