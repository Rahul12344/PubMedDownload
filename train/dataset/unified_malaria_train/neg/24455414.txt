background. cameroon, artesunate-amodiaquine (as/aq) and
artemether-lumefantrine (al) used first-line treatment against
uncomplicated malaria line recommendations. compared the
efficacy safety therapeutic combinations determined the
prevalence drug resistance conferring mutations three parasite genes.
methods. one hundred fifty acute malaria patients six months 14
years age randomized receive standard doses either as/aq (73) al
(77) followedup 28 days. outcome treatment according the
standard classification. dna samples pretreatment parasite isolates were
used determine prevalence resistant mutations pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
dhfr genes. results. drug combinations induced rapid clearance parasites 
and malaria symptoms. pcr-corrected cure rates 100% 96.4% al. the
combinations well tolerated. major haplotypes included cviet (71%), cvmnt
(25%) pfcrt; snd (100%) pfmdr1; irn (79, 8%), ncs (8.8%), and
mixed haplotype (11, 8%) dhfr. conclusion. as/aq al highly 
effective well tolerated treatment uncomplicated falciparum
malaria ngaoundere, cameroon. high prevalence mutant pfcrt alleles confirms
earlier observations. long-term monitoring safety efficacy molecular
markers highly solicited.
