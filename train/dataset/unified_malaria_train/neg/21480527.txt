we investigated biological significance path lengths 12 protein-protein
interaction (ppi) networks. put forward three predictions, based idea
that biological complexity influences path lengths. first, network level, 
path lengths generally longer ppis random networks. second, this
pattern pronounced complex organisms. third, within ppi
network, path lengths individual proteins biologically significant. we
found 11 12 species, average path lengths ppi networks are
significantly longer randomly rewired networks. ppi network 
the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, however, exhibit deviation
from rewired networks. furthermore, eukaryotic ppis exhibit significantly greater
deviation randomly rewired networks prokaryotic ppis. thus study
highlights potentially meaningful variation path lengths ppi networks. 
moreover, node eccentricity, defined longest path protein to
others, significantly correlated levels gene expression and
dispensability yeast ppi network. conclude biological complexity
influences global local properties path lengths ppi networks.
investigating variation path lengths may provide new tools analyze the
evolution functional modules biological systems.
