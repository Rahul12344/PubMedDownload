was reported. pregnant women enrolled antenatal visits number
of received iptp-sp doses recorded well individual sociodemographic
data. peripheral blood collected p. falciparum infection checked by

(msp2). haemoglobin concentration measured p. falciparum positive samples
were typed msp2 allelic diversity. total 363 pregnant women were

by microscopy pcr, respectively. one half (51.5%) the
