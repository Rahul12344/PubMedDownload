the apicomplexan parasite toxoplasma gondii produces plant hormone abscisic
acid, unclear phytohormones produced malaria parasite
plasmodium spp., important parasite phylum. here, report
detection salicylic acid, immune-related phytohormone land plants, p.
berghei anka t. gondii cell lysates. however, addition salicylic acid to
p. falciparum t. gondii culture effect. transfected p. falciparum
3d7 nahg gene, encodes salicylic acid-degrading enzyme isolated 
from plant-infecting pseudomonas sp., established salicylic acid-deficient 
mutant. mutant significantly decreased concentration of
parasite-synthesized prostaglandin e2, potentially modulates host immunity 
as adaptive evolution plasmodium spp. investigate function of
salicylic acid prostaglandin e2 host immunity, established p. berghei
anka mutants expressing nahg. c57bl/6 mice infected nahg transfectants
developed enhanced cerebral malaria, assessed evans blue leakage brain 
histological observation. nahg-transfectant also significantly increased 
mortality rate mice. prostaglandin e2 reduced brain symptoms induction 
of helper-2 cytokines. expected, helper-1 cytokines including interferon-Î³
and interleukin-2 significantly elevated infection nahg
transfectant. thus, salicylic acid plasmodium spp. may new pathogenic
factor threatening parasite may modulate immune function via
parasite-produced prostaglandin e2.
