problem: pregnancy challenge maternal immune system must defend
the body pathogens time develop immune tolerance
against fetus growing inside uterus. despite ex vivo techniques being
used understand processes, vivo techniques missing.
method study: directly study phenomena, developed new
microscope stage surgical procedures use two-photon microscopy, in
vivo observation mouse placenta.
results: tools surgical procedures demonstrate fetal maternal blood
flow inside labyrinth zone placenta, well three dimensional 
structure. also useful identify plasmodium chabaudi-infected red blood 
cells inside labyrinth zone.
conclusion: believe technique represent important contribution
for expanding available knowledge concerning cell dynamics interactions
at fetal-maternal interface.
