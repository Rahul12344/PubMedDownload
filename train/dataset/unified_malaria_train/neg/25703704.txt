plasmodium falciparum virulence linked ability sequester in
post-capillary venules human host. plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) main variant surface antigen implicated in
this process. complete loss parasite adhesion linked large
subtelomeric deletion chromosome 9 number laboratory strains as
d10 t9-96. similar cytoadherent reference line fcr3, d10 strain
expresses pfemp1 surface parasitized erythrocytes, however without 
detectable cytoadhesion. investigate deleted subtelomeric genes
may implicated parasite adhesion, selected 12 genes d10
complementation studies predicted code proteins exported the
red blood cell. identified novel single copy gene (pf3d7_0936500) restricted
to p. falciparum restores adhesion cd36, termed virulence-associated
protein 1 (pfvap1). protein knockdown gene knockout experiments confirmed a
role pfvap1 adhesion process fcr3 parasites. pfvap1 co-exported
with pfemp1 host cell via vesicle-like structures called maurer's
clefts. study identifies novel highly conserved parasite molecule that
contributes parasite virulence possibly assisting pfemp1 establish
functional adhesion host cell surface.
