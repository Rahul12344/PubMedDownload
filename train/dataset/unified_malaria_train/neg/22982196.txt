large numbers plasmodium genes predicted introns. however,
little information exists splicing mechanisms organism. here, we
describe dexd/dexh-box containing pre-mrna processing proteins (prps),
pfprp2p, pfprp5p, pfprp16p, pfprp22p, pfprp28p, pfprp43p pfbrr2p, present 
the plasmodium falciparum genome characterized role one these
factors, pfprp16p. member deah-box protein family nine collinear 
sequence motifs, characteristic helicase proteins. experiments the
recombinantly expressed purified pfprp16 helicase domain revealed binding 
rna, hydrolysis atp well catalytic helicase activities. expression of
helicase domain c-terminal helicase-associated domain (ha2) reduced
these activities considerably, indicating helicase-associated domain may
regulate pfprp16 function. localization studies pfprp16 gfp
transgenic lines suggested role n-terminal domain (1-80 amino acids) 
nuclear targeting. immunodepletion pfprp16p, nuclear extracts parasite
cultures, blocked second catalytic step vitro constituted splicing
reaction suggesting role pfprp16p splicing catalysis. show by
complementation assay yeast chimeric yeast-plasmodium prp16 protein,
not full length pfprp16, rescue yeast prp16 temperature-sensitive
mutant. results suggest although role prp16p catalytic step 
ii highly conserved among plasmodium, human yeast, subtle differences
exist regards associated factors assembly spliceosomes.
