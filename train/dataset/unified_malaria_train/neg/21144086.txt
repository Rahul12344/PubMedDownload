background: growth kinetic plasmodium falciparum culture host
fall short expected growth rate considering 4 x 10(6)/µl red
blood cell (rbcs) available invasion 16 merozoites growing 
infected rbc. study determined whether apoptotic machinery operable to
keep parasite population check.
methods: synchronized culture p. falciparum (dd2 strain) initiated at
0.5% ring stage parasitaemia kept conditions limiting rbcs 
nutrient adjusting hematocrit 5% schizogony changing growth
media daily. parasite growth pattern morphology evaluated blood smear 
microscopy flow-cytometry using sybr green. apoptotic processes were
evaluated evidence of: dna fragmentation tunel, collapse mitochondria
membrane potential (δψm) tmre, expression metacaspase gene rt-qpcr and
by probing parasite proteins anti-caspase antibodies.
results: seeding parasitaemia 0.5%, parasites doubled every 48
hours parasitaemia 4%. thereafter, growth stagnated culture
consistently crashed 6% parasitaemia. δψm potential collapsed the
parasite density increased dna fragmentation increased steadily 0.2% 
~6%. expression metacaspase gene protein observed stages,
but abundance variable among stages.
conclusion: findings suggest existence p. falciparum quorum sensing that
keep parasite population check.
