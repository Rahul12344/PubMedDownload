background: intake plasmodium-infected blood meal may affect mosquito
physiology series trade-offs may occur, particular immune
defences, reproduction self-maintenance. evaluated cost exposure to
plasmodium mosquito vector investigating effect exposure on
fecundity survival implication immune antioxidant defences 
mediating cost.
methods: used natural culex pipiens-plasmodium relictum association. we
exposed female mosquitoes increasing levels parasites allowing to
feed either uninfected canaries, serinus canaria, (unexposed mosquitoes) on
infected canaries low (low exposure) high (high exposure) parasitaemia.
we recorded blood meal size, fecundity (laying probability clutch size) and
survival. quantified expression genes involved immune and
antioxidant defences (nitric oxide synthase, nos; superoxide dismutase, sod;
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, g6pdh).
results: found laying probability exposed females decreased with
increasing exposure parasite increasing sod expression. clutch
size exposed females higher compared unexposed ones similar blood
meal size positively correlated nos expression. found effect
of exposure survival. blood meal intake, sod increased three
groups, nos increased exposed females g6pdh increased highly exposed
females only.
conclusions: results illustrated trade-off fight the
parasite reproduction cost exposure might mediated the
investment immune and/or antioxidant defences. also showed this
trade-off could lead opposed outcome, potentially depending vector
physiological status. finally, highlighted ingestion a
plasmodium-infected blood meal may affect mosquito life history traits a
complex way.
