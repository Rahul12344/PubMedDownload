analysis gene function plasmodium falciparum, important human
malaria parasite, restricted lack robust simple reverse genetic 
tools. approaches manipulate protein levels post-translationally powerful 
tools study protein-off effects especially haploid malaria parasite
where genetic knockouts essential genes lethal. investigated the
auxin-inducible degron system functional p. falciparum found that
degron-tagged yellow fluorescent protein levels efficiently reduced upon
addition auxin otherwise effect parasite viability. the
genetic components required conditional approach co-expressed p. 
falciparum applying small peptide 2a. 2a self-processing peptide from
foot-and-mouth disease virus allows whole conditional system be
accommodated single plasmid vector ensures stoichiometric expression
levels.
