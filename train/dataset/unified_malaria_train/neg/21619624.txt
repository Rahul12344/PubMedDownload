background: malaria remains significant health problem yemen plasmodium
falciparum predominant species responsible 90% the
malaria cases. despite serious concerns regarding increasing drug resistance,
chloroquine still used prevention treatment malaria yemen.
this study carried determine prevalence choloroquine resistance
(cqr) p. falciparum isolated yemen based pfcrt t76 mutation.
methods: cross-sectional study carried among 511 participants four
governorates yemen. blood samples screened using microscopic and
species-specific nested pcr based 18s rrna gene detect identify
plasmodium species. blood samples positive p. falciparum used for
detecting pfcrt t76 mutation using nested-pcr.
results: prevalence pfcrt t76 mutation 81.5% (66 81 isolates).
coastal areas/foothills higher prevalence pfcrt t76 mutation compared to
highland areas (90.5% vs 71.8%) (p = 0.031). pfcrt t76 mutation a
significant association parasitaemia (p = 0.045). univariate analysis shows 
a significant association pfcrt t76 mutation people aged > 10 years (or =
9, 95% ci = 2.3 - 36.2, p = 0.001), low household income (or = 5, 95% ci = 1.3 - 
19.5, p = 0.027), insecticide spray (or = 3.7, 95% ci = 1.16 - 11.86, p =
0.025) sleeping insecticide treated nets (itns) (or = 4.8, 95% ci =
1.38 - 16.78, p = 0.01). logistic regression model confirmed age > 10 years and
low household income predictors pfcrt t76 mutation yemen p. falciparum
isolates.
conclusions: high prevalence pfcrt t76 mutation yemen could a
predictive marker prevalence p. falciparum cqr. finding shows the
necessity in-vivo therapeutic efficacy test cq. p. falciparum cqr
should addressed national strategy control malaria.
