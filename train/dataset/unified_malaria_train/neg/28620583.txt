continuous stage conversion swift changes antigenic repertoire in
response acquired immunity hallmarks complex eukaryotic pathogens,
including plasmodium species, causative agents malaria. efficient
elimination plasmodium liver stages prior blood infection one the
most promising malaria vaccine strategies. here, describe different
genetically arrested parasites (gaps) engineered plasmodium
berghei, p. yoelii p. falciparum compare vaccine potential. a
better understanding immunological mechanisms prime boost by
arrested sporozoites experimental strategies enhance vaccine efficacy by
further engineering existing gaps immunogenic form hold promise for
continuous improvements gap-based vaccines. critical hurdle vaccines
that elicit long-lasting protection malaria, gaps, safety 
efficacy vulnerable populations. vaccine research focus solutions
toward turning malaria vaccine-preventable disease, would offer an
exciting new path malaria control.
