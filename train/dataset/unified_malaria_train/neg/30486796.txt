background: plasmodium falciparum exhibits resistance artemisinin
component frontline antimalarial treatment artemisinin-based combination
therapy south east asia. millions lives risk artemisinin
resistance (art-r) spreads africa. single non-synonymous mutations the
propeller region pf3d7_1343700,"k13" implicated resistance. this
work, use transcriptional profiling characterize laboratory-generated k13
insertional mutant previously demonstrated increased sensitivity to
artemisinins explore functional role k13.
results: set rna-seq microarray experiments confirmed the
expression profile k13 specifically altered early ring early
trophozoite stages mutant intraerythrocytic development cycle. the
down-regulation k13 transcripts mutant early ring stage 
associated transcriptome advance towards trophozoite-like state. to
discover specific downstream effect k13 dysregulation, developed new 
computational method search differential gene expression accounting 
for temporal sequence transcription. found strongest
biological signature transcriptome shift up-regulation dna
replication repair genes early ring developmental stage a
down-regulation dna replication repair genes early trophozoite 
stage; contrast, expressions housekeeping genes unchanged. this
effect, due k13 dysregulation, antagonistic, k13 levels are
negatively correlated dna replication repair gene expression.
conclusion: results support role k13 stress response regulator
consistent hypothesis artemisinins mode action oxidative
stress k13 functional homolog keap1 humans regulates dna
replication repair genes response oxidative stress.
