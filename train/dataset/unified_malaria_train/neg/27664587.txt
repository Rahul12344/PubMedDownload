anopheles mosquito transmits plasmodium, malaria causing parasite. different 
species anopheles mosquito dominate particular geographical location 
are capable transmitting specific strains plasmodium. important to
understand biology different anophelines control parasite
transmission. stat evolutionary conserved transcription factor that
regulates parasite development african malaria vector anopheles gambiae.
unlike drosophila aedes aegypti, single stat gene plays important 
role immunity, an. gambiae contains one evolutionary conserved stat-a and
another retro-duplicated, introns-less stat-b gene. find whether other
species anopheles also two stats, available genomic data different
anophelines used annotate stats silico analyses. our
results revealed indian malaria vector an. stephensi genome contains two
stats, asstat-a asstat-b genes. genes cloned confirmed by
sequencing. asstats found expressed different development
stages mosquito. however, relative mrna levels evolutionary conserved
asstat-a gene always higher retroduplicated asstat-b gene. stat
pathway activated upon plasmodium berghei infection, indicated role in
immunity. furthermore, comparative silico analysis eighteen anopheles
species revealed five species: an. sinensis, an. albimanus, an. darlingi,
an. dirus andan. farauti contain stat-b gene genome.
interestingly, thirteen species subgenus anopheles cellia contain
both stats also mutually diverged. consequence leads sequence
variability significant protein motifs within stat-b genes.
phylogenetic analyses indicated independent, lineage-specific duplication
occurred subgenus cellia diversification series neomyzomyia
from last common ancestor. an. atroparvus (subgenus anopheles), stat gene 
underwent recent lineage-specific duplication give rise highly similar
stat-b gene. suggested genetic divergence various anopheles
species might appeared due adaptations altered environmental
conditions pathogen encounters.
