background: avian haemosporida vector-borne parasites commonly infect
passeriformes. molecular analyses revealed high number different lineages
and lineage specific traits like prevalence host-specificity, knowledge
of parasite prevalence lineage diversity wild birds central germany 
still lacking.
results: blood samples total 238 adult 122 nestling songbirds
belonging six species investigated infections avian
haemosporidian genera lineages (haemoproteus spp., plasmodium spp.,
leucocytozoon spp.) trypanosoma avium using pcr, targeting parasite
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene 18s ribosomal rna. total, prevalence
in adult birds 31.3% infected haemoproteus, 12.5% plasmodium and
71.0% leucocytozoon (nestlings excluded). none tested birds was
infected trypanosoma avium. two nestling birds, aged 12-17 days, a
leucocytozoon spp. infection proven. among 225 successfully sequenced
samples, found four haemoproteus, three plasmodium 19 leucocytozoon
lineages, including two new leucocytozoon lineages. furthermore, report two
new host-lineage associations.
conclusions: first study investigating avian haemosporidian parasites in
central germany, provide new information genetic diversity haemosporida 
infecting passeriformes. show even small sample size new lineages 
as well previously unknown linkages certain lineages host species 
can detected. may help elucidate diversity lineages well 
lineage-host-connections avian haemosporida.
