background: fruit flies mammals protect infection by
mounting immune metabolic responses must balanced the
metabolic needs pathogens. context, p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (mapk)-dependent signaling critical regulating innate immunity 
and metabolism infection. accordingly, asked extent asian
malaria mosquito anopheles stephensi utilizes p38 mapk signaling infection
with human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum.
methods: a. stephensi p38 mapk (asp38 mapk) identified patterns of
signaling vitro vivo (midgut) analyzed using phospho-specific
antibodies small molecule inhibitors. functional effects asp38 mapk
inhibition assessed using p. falciparum infection, quantitative real-time
pcr, assays reactive oxygen species survivorship oxidative stress, 
proteomics, biochemical analyses.
results: genome a. stephensi encodes single p38 mapk activated
in midgut response parasite infection. inhibition asp38 mapk
signaling significantly reduced p. falciparum sporogonic development. this
phenotype associated asp38 mapk regulation mitochondrial physiology
and stress responses midgut epithelium, tissue critical parasite
development. specifically, inhibition asp38 mapk resulted reduction in
mosquito protein synthesis machinery, shift glucose metabolism, reduced
mitochondrial metabolism, enhanced production mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species, induction array anti-parasite effector genes, decreased
resistance oxidative stress-mediated damage. hence, p. falciparum-induced
activation asp38 mapk midgut facilitates parasite infection a
combination reduced anti-parasite immune defenses enhanced host protein
synthesis bioenergetics minimize impact infection host and
to maximize parasite survival, ultimately, transmission.
conclusions: observations suggest that, mammals, innate immunity 
mitochondrial responses integrated mosquitoes asp38
mapk-dependent signaling facilitates mosquito survival parasite infection,
a fact may attest relatively longer evolutionary relationship of
these parasites invertebrate compared vertebrate hosts. 
practical level, improved understanding balances trade-offs between
resistance metabolism could leveraged generate fit, resistant
mosquitoes malaria control.
