in female mosquitoes, host-seeking preference well several other
important behaviors largely driven olfaction. species afrotropical 
anopheles gambiae complex display divergent host-preference associated
with significant differences vectorial capacity human malaria.
olfactory sensitivity begins signal transduction activation of
peripheral sensory neurons populate antennae, maxillary palps 
appendages. used shotgun proteomics characterize profile of
soluble proteins antennae maxillary palps three different species: an. 
coluzzii, an. arabiensis an. quadriannulatus display remarkable
differences anthropophilic behavior. analysis revealed interspecific
differences abundance several proteins comprise cuticular
components, glutathione s-transferase odorant binding proteins, latter of
which known directly involved odor recognition.
