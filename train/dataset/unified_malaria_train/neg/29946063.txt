genome sequences 247 plasmodium falciparum isolates collected gambia in
2008 2014 analysed identify changes possibly related scale-up 
of antimalarial interventions occurred period. overall, there
were 15 regions across genomes signatures positive selection. five of
these sweeps around known drug resistance antigenic loci. signatures

frequent eastern gambia, parasite prevalence transmission remain
high. strong temporal differentiation non-synonymous snp a
cysteine desulfarase (pfnfs) involved iron-sulphur complex biogenesis. 
the 7-year period, frequency lysine variant codon 65 (pfnfs-q65k)
increased 22% (10% 32%) greater banjul area. 2014 2015, 
the frequency variant increased 6% (20% 26%) eastern gambia.

lumefantrine. given declining malaria transmission, consequent loss of
population immunity, sustained drug pressure, important monitor
gambian p. falciparum populations signs adaptation.
