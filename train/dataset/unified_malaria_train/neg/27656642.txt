fluorescence situ hybridization (fish) macromolecule recognition
technology based complementary nature dna dna/rna double strands.
selected dna strands incorporated fluorophore-coupled nucleotides be
used probes hybridize onto complementary sequences tested cells 
tissues visualized fluorescence microscope imaging
system. technology initially developed physical mapping tool to
delineate genes within chromosomes. high analytical resolution single
gene level high sensitivity specificity enabled immediate application 
for genetic diagnosis constitutional common aneuploidies,
microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, subtelomeric rearrangements. fish
tests using panels gene-specific probes somatic recurrent losses, gains,
and translocations routinely applied hematologic solid tumors
and one fastest-growing areas cancer diagnosis. fish also 
used detect infectious microbias parasites like malaria human blood
cells. recent advances fish technology involve various methods improving
probe labeling efficiency use super resolution imaging systems for
direct visualization intra-nuclear chromosomal organization profiling of
rna transcription single cells. cas9-mediated fish (casfish) allowed situ
labeling repetitive sequences single-copy sequences without disruption
of nuclear genomic organization fixed living cells. using oligopaint-fish
and super-resolution imaging enabled situ visualization chromosome
haplotypes differentially specified single-nucleotide polymorphism loci.
single molecule rna fish (smrna-fish) using combinatorial labeling sequential 
barcoding multiple round hybridization applied measure mrna
expression multiple genes within single cells. research applications 
single molecule single cells dna rna fish techniques visualized
intra-nuclear genomic structure sub-cellular transcriptional dynamics many
genes revealed functions various biological processes.
