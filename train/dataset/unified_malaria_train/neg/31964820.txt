tsetse-transmitted african trypanosomes must develop mammalian-infectious
metacyclic cells fly's salivary glands (sgs) transmission new 
host. molecular mechanisms underlie developmental process, known as
metacyclogenesis, poorly understood. blocking metacyclic parasites
deposited saliva development mammal could prevent disease.
to obtain in-depth perspective metacyclogenesis, performed single-cell
rna sequencing (scrna-seq) pool 2,045 parasites collected infected
tsetse sgs. data revealed three major cell clusters represent the
epimastigote, pre- mature metacyclic trypanosome developmental stages.
individual cell level data also confirm metacyclic pool diverse, 
that parasite expresses one unique metacyclic variant surface
glycoprotein (mvsg) coat protein transcripts identified. clustering of
cells revealed dynamic transcriptomic metabolic landscape reflective a
developmental program leading infectious metacyclic forms preadapted to
survive mammalian host environment. describe expression profile 
proteins regulate gene expression potentially play role in
metacyclogenesis. also report family nonvariant surface proteins
(fam10) demonstrate surface localization one member (named sgm1.7) on
mature metacyclic parasites. vaccination mice recombinant sgm1.7 reduced 
parasitemia early infection. future studies warranted investigate
fam10 family proteins potential trypanosome transmission blocking vaccine
antigens. experimental approach translationally relevant developing
strategies prevent insect saliva-transmitted parasites infecting
and causing disease mammalian hosts.
