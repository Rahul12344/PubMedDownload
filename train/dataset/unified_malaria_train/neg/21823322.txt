objective: clone express three var2csa duffy antigen-binding ligand (dbl) 
domains (dbl4/ 5/6) encoded var2csa gene hainan isolate plasmodium
falciparum, study difference chondroitin sulfate (csa)-binding
activity among them.
methods: three dbl domains amplified pcr cloned vector
pmd18-t. recombinant plasmids identified enzyme digestion and
sequencing, subcloned prokaryotic expression vector pet-22b.
the recombinant plasmid transformed e. coli bl21 (de3) followed by
expression protein induced iptg. recombinant protein purified
with gracitrap kit identified sds-page western blotting.
csa-binding activity three recombinant dbl domains assayed elisa.
results: target genes amplified length 996 bp, 859 bp and
894 bp. constructed recombinant plasmids identified enzyme digestion 
and dna sequencing. recombinant proteins (dbl4/5/6) purified, the
relative molecular mass dblfa, dbl5 dbl6 mr 439 800, mr 34,500 mr 
36,000, respectively. purified protein confirmed immunogenicity
by western blotting. results adhesion experiment indicated a405
values dbl5 domain different concentration significantly higher than
that dbla dbl6.
conclusion: three recombinant proteins (dbla/5/6) var2csa dbl domains were
expressed, dbl5 domain high binding affinity csa.
