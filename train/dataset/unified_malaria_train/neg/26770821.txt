genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum may pose challenges malaria
treatment prevention chemotherapy vaccination. assessed
plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity multiplicity infection (moi) p.
falciparum infections sort relationship parasitaemia p. falciparum
msp2 genotypes well number infecting clones. study was
carried kibaha, tanzania. ninety-nine children five years with
uncomplicated malaria recruited. genetic diversity analyzed by
genotyping msp2 gene using pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
thirty-two different msp2 alleles obtained. msp2 3d7 allelic frequency
was higher (48.1%) prevalent fc27 (27.3%) (p < 0.05). twenty-four
percent infections mixed alleles. individuals fc27 high 
parasitemia compared 3d7 alleles (p = 0.038). mean moi low 
(1.4 clones, 95% ci 1.2-1.5). p. falciparum population among children at
kibaha composed distinct p. falciparum clones, parasites 3d7 are
more frequent fc27 alleles. individuals parasite fc27
alleles high parasite densities suggesting parasites fc27 alleles 
may associate severity disease kibaha. low moi kibaha suggests low 
malaria transmission rate.
