erythrocytes reservoirs important epoxide-containing lipid signaling
molecules, including epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eets). eets function as
vasodilators anti-inflammatory modulators bloodstream. bioactive eets 
are hydrolyzed less active diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids) epoxide
hydrolases (ehs). malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum infects host red
blood cells (rbcs) exports hundreds proteins rbc compartment. 
this study, show two parasite epoxide hydrolases, p falciparum epoxide
hydrolases 1 (pfeh1) 2 (pfeh2), noncanonical serine nucleophiles,
are exported periphery infected rbcs. pfeh1 pfeh2 successfully
expressed escherichia coli, hydrolyzed physiologically relevant
erythrocyte eets. mutations active site residues pfeh1 ablated ability 
of enzyme hydrolyze epoxide substrate. overexpression pfeh1 pfeh2
in parasite-infected rbcs resulted significant alteration epoxide
fatty acids stored rbc phospholipids. hypothesize parasite
disruption epoxide-containing signaling lipids leads perturbed vascular
function, creating favorable conditions binding sequestration infected
rbcs microvascular endothelium.importance: malaria parasite exports
hundreds proteins erythrocyte compartment. however, these
proteins, physiological function unknown. study, investigate 
two "hypothetical" proteins α/β-hydrolase fold family share sequence 
similarity epoxide hydrolases (ehs)-enzymes destroy bioactive epoxides.
altering eh expression parasite-infected erythrocytes resulted a
significant change epoxide fatty acids stored host cell. propose
that eh enzymes may help parasite manipulate host blood vessel
opening inflame vessel walls pass circulation system.
understanding malaria parasite interacts host rbcs aid in
our ability combat deadly disease.
