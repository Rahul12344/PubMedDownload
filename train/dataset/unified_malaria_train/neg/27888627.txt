objective: osteosarcoma (os) malignant bone tumor high morbidity in
young adults adolescents. study aimed discover potential early
diagnosis biomarkers os.
results: total, 111 differentially expressed genes (degs) identified in
primary os compared normal controls 235 degs identified in
metastatic os compared primary os. aurkb ppp2r2b significantly 
up-regulated down-regulated hub proteins, respectively, ppi
protein-protein network (ppi) network primary os. isg15 btrc the
significantly up-regulated down-regulated hub proteins, respectively, 
network metastatic os. degs metastatic os compared primary os were
significantly enriched arachidonic acid metabolism, malaria, chemokine
signaling pathways. finally, employed quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qrt-pcr) validate expression levels candidate degs the
results indicated bioinformatics approach acceptable.
materials methods: mrna expression profiling 20 subjects obtained 
through high-throughput rna-sequencing. degs identified primary os
and normal control, primary os metastatic os, respectively.
functional annotation ppi networks used obtain insights the
functions degs. qrt-pcr performed detect expression levels of
dysregulated genes os.
conclusions: work might provide groundwork exploration of
tumorigenesis metastasis mechanisms os.
