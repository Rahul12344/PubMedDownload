background: plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (pfcsp) potential
malaria vaccine candidate, various polymorphisms pfcsp gene among
global p. falciparum population become major barrier effectiveness 
vaccines. study aimed investigate genetic polymorphisms natural
selection pfcsp bioko comparison among global p. falciparum
population.
methods: january 2011 december 2018, 148 blood samples collected
from p. falciparum infected bioko patients 96 monoclonal sequences them
were successfully acquired analysed 2200 global pfcsp sequences mined
from malariagen pf3k database ncbi.
results: bioko, n-terminus pfcsp showed limited genetic variations 
the numbers repetitive sequences (nanp/nvdp) mainly found 40 (35%) and
41 (34%) central region. polymorphic characters found th2r/th3r
region, where natural selection (p > 0.05) recombination occurred. the
overall pattern bioko pfcsp gene obvious deviation african
mainland pfcsp (fst = 0.00878, p < 0.05). comparative analysis bioko and
global pfcsp displayed various mutation patterns obvious geographic
differentiation among populations four continents (p < 0.05). global
pfcsp c-terminal sequences clustered 138 different haplotypes (h_1 to
h_138). 3.35% sequences matched 3d7 strain haplotype (h_1).
conclusions: genetic polymorphism phenomena pfcsp found universal 
bioko global isolates majority mutations located cell epitopes. 
global genetic polymorphism geographical characteristics recommended 
be considered future improvement malaria vaccine design.
