glutamate dehydrogenases (gdhs) play key roles cellular redox, amino acid, and
energy metabolism, thus representing potential targets pharmacological
interventions. studied functional network provided three known
glutamate dehydrogenases malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. the
recombinant production previously described pfgdh1 hexahistidyl-tagged 
proteins optimized. additionally, pfgdh2 cloned, recombinantly produced, 
and characterized. like pfgdh1, pfgdh2 nadp(h)-dependent enzyme a
specific activity comparable pfgdh1 slightly higher k(m) values for
its substrates. three-dimensional structure hexameric pfgdh2 solved to
3.1 å resolution. overall structure shows high similarity pfgdh1 but
with significant differences occurring subunit interface. mammalian 
gdh1, pfgdh2 subunit-subunit interactions mainly assisted hydrogen 
bonds hydrophobic interactions, whereas pfgdh1 contacts mediated
by networks salt bridges hydrogen bonds. accordance this, the
known bovine gdh inhibitors hexachlorophene, gw5074, bithionol more
effective pfgdh2 pfgdh1. subcellular localization determined for
all three plasmodial gdhs fusion green fluorescent protein. based 
our data, pfgdh1 pfgdh3 cytosolic proteins whereas pfgdh2 clearly
localizes apicoplast, plastid-like organelle specific apicomplexan
parasites. study provides new insights structure function of
gdh isoenzymes p. falciparum, represent potential targets the
development novel antimalarial drugs.
