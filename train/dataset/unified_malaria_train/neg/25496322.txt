background: msp-7 gene become differentially expanded plasmodium
genus; plasmodium vivax highest copy number gene, several of
which encode antigenic proteins merozoites.
methods: dna sequences thirty-six colombian clinical isolates p. vivax 
(pv) msp-7e, -7f -7l genes analysed characterizing studying 
genetic diversity pvmsp-7 members expressed the
intra-erythrocyte stage; natural selection signals producing variation
pattern observed evaluated.
results: pvmsp-7e gene highly polymorphic compared pvmsp-7f and
pvmsp-7l seen limited genetic diversity; pvmsp-7e polymorphism
was seen maintained different types positive selection. even
though copies seemed species-specific duplications, search the
plasmodium cynomolgi genome (p. vivax sister taxon) showed species
shared whole msp-7 repertoire. led exploring long-term effect 
natural selection comparing orthologous sequences led finding
signatures lineage-specific positive selection.
conclusions: results confirmed p. vivax msp-7 family a
heterogeneous genetic diversity pattern; members highly conserved whilst
others highly diverse. results suggested 3'-end genes
encode msp-7 proteins' functional region whilst central region pvmsp-7e
has evolved rapidly. lineage-specific positive selection signals found
suggested mutations occurring msp-7s genes host switch may have
succeeded adapting ancestral p. vivax parasite population humans.
