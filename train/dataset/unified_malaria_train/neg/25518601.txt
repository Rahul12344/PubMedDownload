one hundred one imported falciparum malaria cases wuhan city were
confirmed microscopy nest-pcr, blood samples collected. the
pf60.1 gene amplified pcr. among 101 blood samples, three pf60.1 fragments
[313 bp (56.5%, 52/92), 340 bp (37.0%, 34/92), 313 bp+340 bp (6.5%, 6/92)] were
amplified 92 samples. among 83 blood samples patients returning from
africa, 313 bp fragment found 46 samples (55.4%, 46/83), 340 bp fragment 
were found 31 samples (37.1%, 31/83), 7.2% (6/83) mixed-fragment (313 
bp+340 bp). among 9 samples southeast asia, 6 samples 313 bp
fragment 3 samples 340 bp fragment. results indicated 
common genotype 313 bp-genotype, would polyclonal p. falciparum 
infections.
