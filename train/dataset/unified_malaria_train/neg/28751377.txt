juvenile hormone (jh) key regulator insect development reproduction. 
in adult mosquitoes, essential maturation ovary normal male 
reproductive behavior, jh distribution activity regulated after
secretion unclear. here, report new type specific jh-binding protein, 
given name mosquito juvenile hormone-binding protein (mjhbp), which
circulates hemolymph pupal adult aedes aegypti males females.
mjhbp member odorant-binding protein (obp) family, orthologs 
present genomes aedes, culex, anopheles mosquito species. using
isothermal titration calorimetry, show mjhbp specifically binds jh ii and
jh iii eicosanoids jh derivatives. mjhbp crystallized the
presence jh iii found double obp domain structure reminiscent of
salivary "long" d7 proteins mosquitoes. observed single jh iii
molecule contained n-terminal domain binding pocket closed in
an apparent conformational change c-terminal domain-derived Î±-helix. the
electron density ligand indicated high occupancy natural 10r
enantiomer jh iii. note, mjhbp structurally unrelated hemolymph jhbp 
from lepidopteran insects. low level expression mjhbp ae. aegypti
larvae suggests primarily active adult stage could
potentially influence effects jh egg development, mating behavior,
feeding, processes.
