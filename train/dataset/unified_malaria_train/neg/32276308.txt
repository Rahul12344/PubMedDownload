despite amount resources deployed technological advancements in
molecular biology, vaccinology, immunology, genetics, biotechnology, there
are still effective vaccines malaria. immunity malaria usually
seen species- and/or strain-specific. however, growing body of
evidence suggesting possibility existence cross-strain,
cross-species, cross-genus immune responses apicomplexans. principle
of gene conservation indicates homologues play similar role closely
