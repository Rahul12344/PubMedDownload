background: malaria major cause morbidity mortality angola. 
most vulnerable groups plasmodium falciparum infection pregnant women 
children five years age. use intermittent preventive treatment
(ipt) sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) pregnant women introduced in
angola 2006 national malaria control programme, currently this
strategy considered used children malaria control. considering
the previous wide use sp combination angola, together reported cases
of sp treatment failure crucial evaluation prevalence five
mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes associated p. falciparum resistance sp
before introduction s/p ipt children.
methods: study conducted five provinces, different transmission
intensities: huambo, cabinda, uíge, kwanza norte, malanje. detection of
the mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes carried 452 p. falciparum
blood samples pcr rflp.
results: pfdhfr gene, 90,3% samples carried mutation 51i, with
7.5% mixed infections; 51% carried wild type allele 59c, 29.2% mixed
infections and; 99.1% isolates harboured mutant allele 108n. concerning,
pfdhps gene, 83,1% mutant type 437g 11% mixed infections , 87% of
the studied isolates wild type codon 540.
discussion: first representative epidemiological study whole
angola country prevalence genotypes associated sp
chemoresistance. high frequency individual mutations genes (51i 
108n pfdhfr, 437g pfdhps) found, besides low prevalence the
quintuple mutation.
conclusion: data showed implementation ipt using sp children
needs reviewed.
