we found 47 aa protein sequence occurs 17 times plasmodium vivax
nucleotide database published plasmodb. coding sequence analysis showed
multiple restriction enzyme sites within 141Â bp nucleotide sequence, a
his6 tag attached 3' end, suggesting cloning vector origins. sequences
with vector contamination submitted ncbi, blastn used to
cross-examine whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) four recently deposited p. 
vivax whole genome sequencing projects. least 26 genes listed the
plasmodb database incorporate cloning vector sequence their
predicted provisional protein products.
