despite significant progress combating malaria recent years burden of
severe disease death due plasmodium infections remains global public
health concern. fraction infected people develops severe clinical
syndromes motivating longstanding search genetic determinants malaria
severity. strong genetic effects repeatedly ascribed mutations and
allelic variants proteins expressed red blood cells role of
inflammatory response genes disease pathogenesis difficult to
discern. revisited genetic evidence provided inflammatory response genes
that repeatedly associated malaria, namely tnf, nos2, ifnar1, hmox1,
tlrs, cd36, cd40lg. highlighted specific genetic variants having
opposing roles development distinct malaria clinical outcomes and
unveiled diverse levels genetic heterogeneity shaped complex
association landscape inflammatory response genes malaria. however,
scrutinizing genetic effects individual variants corroborates pathogenesis
model pro-inflammatory genetic variants acting early infection stages
contribute resolve infection later stages confer increased
vulnerability severe organ dysfunction driven tissue inflammation. human
genetics studies invaluable tool find genes molecular pathways
involved inflammatory response malaria precise roles in
disease pathogenesis still unexploited. genome editing malaria
experimental models novel genotyping-by-sequencing techniques promising
approaches delineate relevance inflammatory response gene variants in
the natural history infection thereby offer new rational angles on
adjuvant therapeutics prevention clinical management severe malaria.
