background: coadministration artemether-lumefantrine efavirenz been
shown result significant interactions. influence functional genetic 
polymorphisms selected cyps magnitude interaction was
investigated pregnant nonpregnant adults.
method: standard 3-day regimen artemether-lumefantrine administered to
each patient steady-state efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (art).
pharmacokinetic parameters obtained intensive plasma concentration-time
data. genotyping data tested compliance hardy-weinberg equilibrium 
by chi-square test. linear regressions, mann-whitney u-test kruskal-wallis
tests conducted examine association lumefantrine plasma level with
cyp2b6 c.516g>t, nr1i3 152c-1089t>c, cyp2b6 c.983t>c, cyp3a5*3 cyp3a4*22.
results: among total 69 malaria-hiv coinfected patients (34 nonpregnant 
35 pregnant), median (interquartile range) age 33 (27-36.5) years body
weight 59.5 (50-67.5) kg. nonpregnant group, cyp2b6 c.516g>t was
significantly associated lower log cday 7 lumefantrine using multivariate
linear regressions (β = -0.239; p = 0.013). 59% women cyp2b6 c.516t,
cday 7 lumefantrine target 280 ng/ml compared 47% the
noncarriers. cyp2b6 c.983t>c significantly associated higher log cday 7 of
desbutyl lumefantrine pregnant (β = 0.383; p = 0.033) nonpregnant
(β = 0.395; p = 0.023) groups. composite genotypes cyp2b6
single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated lumefantrine plasma
concentration. associative trend lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and
nr1i3 152c-1089t>c genotypes indicated 70% cday 7 lumefantrine 
those nr1i3 152c-1089tt genotype 280 ng/ml compared 53% in
those nr1i3 152c-1089cc ct genotype.
conclusion: findings revealed efavirenz-lumefantrine interaction was
accentuated group cyp2b6 c.516t, c.983c nr1i3 152c-1089t alleles.
this warrants investigations drug-drug interactions for
optimising dosing genetically defined subgroups, particularly drug
development.
