nucleosomes basic structural units eukaryotic chromatin play key
role regulation gene expression. nucleosome formation depends on
several factors, including properties sequence itself, also physical
constraints epigenetic factors chromatin-remodelling enzymes. this
view, sequence-dependent approach able capture general tendency a
region bind histone octamer. reference data set positioned nucleosomes 
of saccharomyces cerevisiae used study role dna helical rise in
histone-dna interaction. genomic sequences transformed arrays of
helical rise values tetranucleotide code turned profiles of
mean helical rise values. profiles resemble maps nucleosome occupancy,
suggesting intrinsic histone-dna interactions linked helical rise.
the obtained results show preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs the
mean helical rise reaches largest values. mean helical rise profiles obtained
by using maps positioned nucleosomes drosophila melanogaster and
plasmodium falciparum genomes, well homo sapiens chromosome 20 confirm that
nucleosomes mainly located mean helical rise reaches largest
values.
