background: lymphatic filariasis caused parasitic worms wuchereria
bancrofti, brugia malayi b. timori, transmitted via bites from
infected mosquitoes. human body, parasites develop adult
worms lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage swelling the
affected tissues. according world health organization, 1.2 billion
people 58 countries risk contracting lymphatic filariasis. 
drugs available treat patients infected parasites, these
have low efficacy adult stages worms, live 7-15 
years human body. requirement annual treatment increases risk 
of drug-resistant worms emerging, making imperative develop new drugs
against devastating diseases.
methodology/principal findings: developed yeast-based, high-throughput 
screening system whereby essential yeast genes replaced filarial
or human counterparts. strains labeled different fluorescent
proteins allow simultaneous monitoring strains parasite human
genes competition, hence identification compounds inhibit 
parasite target without affecting human ortholog. constructed yeast
strains expressing eight different brugia malayi drug targets (as well seven
of human counterparts), performed medium-throughput drug screens for
compounds specifically inhibit parasite enzymes. using malaria box
collection (400 compounds), identified nine filarial specific inhibitors and
confirmed antifilarial activity five using vitro assays
against brugia pahangi.
conclusions/significance: able functionally complement yeast deletions
with eight different brugia malayi enzymes represent potential drug targets.
we demonstrated yeast-based screening platform efficient in
identifying compounds discriminate human filarial enzymes.
hence, confident extend efforts construction of
strains filarial targets (in particular species that
cannot cultivated laboratory), perform high-throughput drug screens
to identify specific inhibitors parasite enzymes. establishing
synergistic collaborations researchers working directly different
parasitic worms, aim aid antihelmintic drug development human 
veterinary infections.
