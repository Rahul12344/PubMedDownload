nearly two-thirds proteins encoded plasmodium falciparum, parasite 
that causes deadly form malaria, annotated "hypothetical." the
yeast two-hybrid assay, requires prior knowledge target
protein, great potential provide functional information these
uncharacterized proteins. however, p. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens are
hampered poor expression p. falciparum genes yeast. au-rich
sequences nascent p. falciparum transcripts resemble 3' end processing
sites yeast mrnas, prematurely cleaved polyadenylated. most
cases, aberrant messages degraded yield protein. overcome
this limitation, developed methods extensively fragment p. falciparum 
genes. novel yeast two-hybrid vectors, auxotrophic markers fused 
the 3' ends cloned inserts, employed identify gene fragments 
that expressed yeast. chapter, provide detailed protocols for
fragmenting p. falciparum genes, creating p. falciparum activation domain
libraries, performing p. falciparum yeast two-hybrid screens. though focused 
on p. falciparum, approaches described applicable organisms
and likely especially useful at-rich genomes, 
also likely poorly expressed yeast.
