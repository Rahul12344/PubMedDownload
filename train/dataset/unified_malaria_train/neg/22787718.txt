we produced transgenic mosquito expressing rodent malaria vaccine candidate
antigen salivary gland. three tandemly repeated amino acid units 
repeat region circumsporozoite protein plasmodium berghei (pbcs3r) fused to
red fluorescent protein (monomeric dsred) chosen vaccine candidate
antigen. immunoblot fluorescence microscopic analyses showed transgene
expression female salivary gland. transgene product released 
the proboscis component saliva. monomeric dsred-fusion expression
system could suitable transgene secretion saliva female
mosquitoes. mice repeatedly bitten transgenic mosquitoes raised antibodies
against p. berghei sporozoites, sera protective ability against
sporozoite invasion human hepatoma hepg2 cells. results suggest that
transgene products immunogenically active saliva, induce the
antibodies malaria parasite. findings indicate technology 
the potential production 'flying vaccinator' rodent malaria
parasites.
