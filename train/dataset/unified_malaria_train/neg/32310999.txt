the emergence artemisinin (art) resistance plasmodium falciparum
intra-erythrocytic parasites led increasing treatment failure rates with
first-line art-based combination therapies southeast asia. decreased parasite 
susceptibility caused k13 mutations, associated clinically with
delayed parasite clearance patients vitro enhanced ability of
ring-stage parasites survive brief exposure active art metabolite
dihydroartemisinin. herein, describe panel k13-specific monoclonal
antibodies gene-edited parasite lines co-expressing epitope-tagged versions
of k13 trans. applying analytical quantitative imaging pipeline, we
localize k13 parasite endoplasmic reticulum, rab-positive vesicles, and
sites adjacent cytostomes. latter structures form parasite plasma
membrane traffic hemoglobin digestive vacuole wherein
artemisinin-activating heme moieties released. also provide evidence of
k13 partially localizing near parasite mitochondria upon treatment with
dihydroartemisinin. immunoprecipitation data generated k13-specific
monoclonal antibodies identify multiple putative k13-associated proteins,
including endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecules, mitochondrial proteins, and
rab gtpases, k13 mutant wild-type isogenic lines. also find that
mutant k13-mediated resistance reversed upon co-expression wild-type or
mutant k13. data help define biological properties k13 role 
in mediating p. falciparum resistance art treatment.
