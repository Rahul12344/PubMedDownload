background: benin, national malaria control programme (nmcp) changed the
policy malaria treatment 2004 following increasing failure rate of
treatment chloroquine (cq) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp). the
objective study determinate prevalence plasmodium
falciparum molecular markers associated resistance cq sp 
benin seven years new policy instituted.
methods: study conducted southern benin, region characterized a
perennial malaria transmission. blood samples collected 2011 from
children presenting symptomatic asymptomatic p. falciparum infections
and living area. prevalence critical point mutations the
genes pfcrt (codon 76), pfmdr1 (codon 86), pfdhfr (codons, 51, 59 108) and
pfdhps (codons 437, 540) examined parasite isolates mutation-specific
restriction enzyme digestion nested pcr products.
results: high prevalence parasites carrying point mutations studied
targets found: t76: 93.9% [89.8; 96.7], i51: 96.2% [92.7; 98.4], r59: 93, 9% 
[89.7; 96.7], n108: 97.6% [94.6; 99.2] g437: 71.4% [64.8; 77.4]. mutation 
was found codon 540 pfdhps gene. proportion parasite isolates
carrying triple mutation pfdhfr gene irn (i51, r59 andn108) quadruple 
mutation combination pfdhfr/pfdhps irng (i51, r59, n108 g437) was
91.5% [86.9; 94.9] 65.7% [58.9; 72.1], respectively. analysis mutation 
relation clinical status (symptomatic asymptomatic) according to
age (younger older 10 years) showed similar high frequencies each
category without significant difference two groups.
conclusions: results suggest persistence level resistance p.
falciparum cq sp, seven years recommendation change of
malaria treatment policy benin. distribution mutations studied was
neither related age clinical status.
