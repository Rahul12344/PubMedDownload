background: recent years plasmodium vivax reported cause
severe infections associated mortality. clinical evaluation limited
accuracy early identification patients progressing towards the
fatal condition. researchers tried identify serum the
plasma-based indicators severe malaria. discovery microrna (mirna) 
opened era identification early biomarkers various infectious and
non-infectious diseases. micrornas (mirna) small non-coding rna molecules
of length 19-24 nts responsible regulation majority of
human gene expressions post transcriptional level.
methods: identified differentially expressed mirnas microarray and
validated selected mirnas qrt-pcr. assessed diagnostic potential of
these up-regulated mirnas complicated p. vivax malaria. futher, the
bioinformtic analysis performed construct protein-protein mrna-mirna
networks identify highly regulated mirna.
results: present study, utility mirna potential biomarker of
complicated p. vivax malaria explored. total 276 mirnas found be
differentially expressed mirna microarray 5 mirnas
(hsa-mir-7977, hsa-mir-28-3p, hsa-mir-378-5p, hsa-mir-194-5p hsa-mir-3667-5p)
were found significantly up-regulated complicated p. vivax malaria
patients using qrt-pcr. diagnostic potential 5 mirnas found 
be significant sensitivity specificity 60-71% 69-81% respectively
and area curve (auc) 0.7 (p < 0.05). moreover, silico analysis the
common targets up-regulated mirnas revealed uba52 hsa-mir-7977 majorly 
regulated hubs ppi mrna-mirna networks, suggesting putative role
in complicated p. vivax malaria.
conclusion: mir-7977 might act potential biomarker differentiating
complicated p. vivax malaria uncomplicated type. elevated levels of
mir-7977 may role play disease pathology uba52 or
tgf-beta signalling pathway.
