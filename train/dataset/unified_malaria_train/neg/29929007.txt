the rising use sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) treatment chloroquine 
(cq)-resistant plasmodium falciparum resulted increased exposure p.
vivax isolates iran, species circulated. this
investigation, frequency pvdhfr pvmdr-1 mutants assessed p.
vivax strains 2001-2016 introduction sp/cq malarious areas
of iran. p. vivax isolates (n, 52) obtained autochthonous samples
in southeast iran 2015-2016. genomic dna extracted examined
using nested polymerase chain reaction-(pcr) sequencing. mutations were
detected pvdhfr codons p33l (21.2%), t61 m (25%), s93h (3.9%), s117 t
(1.9%) 5 isolates showed double mutations (33 l/61 m, 7.7%; 33 l/117 t,
1.9%). mutation identified pvdhfr codons f57 s58. pvmdr-1
1076 l mutation detected 93.3% p. vivax isolates. findings
indicated frequency three codons pvdhfr f57/s58/s117 decreased
from 2001 (1.05%/7.0%/16.9%) 2016 (0%/0%/1.9%). genomic analysis pvmdr-1
showed frequency 1076 l gradually increased 2013 (93%) to
2016 (93.3%) (p > .05). results demonstrated p. vivax isolates are
probably exited sp pressure, reflects appropriate level 
training field microscopists, established iranian policymakers.
emergent pvdhfr codons 33l, 61m, 93h noticed plausible drug
tolerance treatment plans. high prevalence pvmdr-1 1076l mutation
shows efficacy cq combination primaquine may danger being
compromised, however investigations needed evaluate clinical
importance cq-resistant p. vivax isolates.
