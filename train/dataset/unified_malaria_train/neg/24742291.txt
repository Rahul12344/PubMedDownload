background: primaquine, available drug effective plasmodium
falciparum sexual stages, induces also dose-dependent haemolysis, especially in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (g6pdd) individuals. therefore, is
important determine prevalence deficiency areas would
potentially benefit use. prevalence g6pd deficiency genotype
and enzyme activity determined healthy school children gambia.
methods: blood samples primary school children collected dry season
malaria survey screened g6pdd malaria infection. genotypes for
allele mutations reported country; 376, 202a-, 968a- 542 analysed
while enzyme activity (phenotype) assayed using semi-quantitative
commercial test kit. enzyme activity values fitted finite mixture model
to determine distribution calculate cut-off deficiency. the
association genotype phenotype boys girls well the
association mutant genotype deficient phenotype analysed.
results: samples 1,437 children; 51% boys analysed. prevalence of
p. falciparum malaria infection 14%. prevalence 202a-, 968 542
mutations 1.8%, 2.1% 1.0%, respectively, higher boys in
girls. prevalence g6pdd phenotype 6.4% (92/1,437), 7.8% (57/728) in
boys 4.9% (35/709) girls significantly higher odds former (or 
1.64, 95% ci 1.05, 2.53, p = 0.026). deficient phenotype associated 
reduced odds malaria infection (or 0.77, 95% ci 0.36, 1.62, p = 0.49).
conclusions: weak association genotype phenotype estimates
of g6pdd prevalence. phenotype expression deficiency represents
combinations mutant alleles rather specific mutations. genotype studies
in individuals deficient phenotype would help identify alleles responsible
for haemolysis.
