ending tuberculosis (tb) epidemic 2030 recently listed united
nations (un) sustainable development goals alongside hiv/aids malaria it
continues major cause death worldwide. significant proportion
of tb cases caused resistant strains mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb),
there urgent need develop new innovative approaches treatment.
since 1989, researchers assessing anti-bacterial effects the
active metabolite vitamin a, trans-retinoic acid (atra) solution, mtb
models. recently antibacterial effect atra shown regulate
the immune response infection via critical gene expression, monocyte
activation induction autophagy leading application a
host-directed therapy (hdt). inhalation attractive route targeted
treatment tb, therefore developed atra-loaded microparticles
(atra-mp) within inhalable size range (2.07 ± 0.5 µm) offering targeted
delivery encapsulated cargo (70.5 ± 2.3%) site action within the
alveolar macrophage, confirmed confocal microscopy. efficient
cellular delivery atra followed reduction mtb growth (h37ra) in
thp-1 derived macrophages evaluated bact/alert® system and
enumeration colony forming units (cfu). antibacterial effect atra-mp
treatment assessed balb/c mice infected virulent strain
of mtb (h37rv). atra-mp treatments significantly decreased bacterial burden
in lungs alongside reduction pulmonary pathology following three
doses administered intratracheally. immunomodulatory effects targeted atra
treatment lungs indicate distinct yet effective mechanism action
amongst formulations. first study to-date controlled release
atra treatment tb suitable inhalation offers improved targeting a
hdt, retains antibacterial efficacy improves pulmonary pathology compared 
atra solution.
