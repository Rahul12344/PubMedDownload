the aim study explore possible molecular markers chloroquine
resistance plasmodium vivax isolates thailand. total 30 p. vivax
isolates collected malaria endemic area along thai-myanmar border
in mae sot district thailand. dried blood spot samples collected for
analysis pvmdr1 pvcrt-o polymorphisms. blood samples (100 Î¼l) were
collected finger-prick vitro chloroquine susceptibility testing by
schizont maturation inhibition assay. based cut-off ic50 100 nm, 19
(63.3%) isolates classified chloroquine resistant p. vivax isolates.
seven non-synonymous mutations 2 synonymous identified pvmdr1 gene.
y976f f1076l mutations detected 7 (23.3%) 16 isolates (53.3%),
respectively. analysis pvcrt-o gene revealed isolates wild-type.
our results suggest chloroquine resistance gene spreading this
area. monitoring chloroquine resistant molecular markers provide useful tool
for future control p. vivax malaria.
