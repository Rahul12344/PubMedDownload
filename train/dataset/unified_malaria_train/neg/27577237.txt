background: safety immunogenicity pfama1, adjuvanted with
alhydrogel(®) assessed malaria-experienced malian adults. malaria
vaccine, pfama1-fvo [25-545] recombinant protein pichia pastoris-expressed
ama-1 plasmodium falciparum fvo clone adsorbed alhydrogel(®), control
vaccine tetanus toxoid produced formaldehyde detoxified purified
tetanus toxin.
methods: double blind randomized controlled phase 1 study enrolled followed
40 healthy adults aged 18-55 years bandiagara, mali, west africa, rural
setting intense seasonal transmission p. falciparum malaria. volunteers
were randomized receive either 50 µg malaria vaccine control
vaccine. three doses vaccine given days 0, 28 56, participants
were followed 1 year. solicited symptoms assessed seven days and
unsolicited symptoms 28 days vaccination. serious adverse events
were assessed throughout study. titres anti-ama-1 antibodies were
measured elisa p. falciparum growth inhibition assays performed.
results: commonest local solicited adverse events injection site pain
and swelling frequent pfama1 group. vaccine related serious
adverse events reported. significant 3.5-fold increase anti-ama-1 igg
antibodies observed malaria vaccine recipients four weeks third 
immunization compared control group.
conclusion: pfama1 showed good safety profile. adverse events reported
were mild moderate intensity. addition, vaccine induced a
significant though short-lived increase anti-ama1 igg titres. registered
on www.clinicaltrials.gov number nct00431808.
