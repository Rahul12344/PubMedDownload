background: malaria control efforts significant impact epidemiology
and parasite population dynamics. countries aiming malaria elimination,
malaria transmission may restricted limited transmission hot spots, where
parasite populations may isolated experience different
selection forces. aim examine plasmodium vivax population
divergence geographically isolated transmission zones thailand.
methodology: employed p. vivax merozoite surface protein 3β (pvmsp3β) a
molecular marker characterizing p. vivax populations based extensive
diversity gene southeast asian parasite populations. examine two
parasite populations different transmission levels thailand, obtained 
45 p. vivax isolates tak province, northwestern thailand, annual
parasite incidence (api) 2%, 28 isolates yala and
narathiwat provinces, southern thailand, api less 0.02%. we
sequenced pvmsp3β gene examined genetic diversity molecular
evolution parasite populations.
principal findings: 58 isolates containing single pvmsp3β alleles, 31 sequence
types identified. overall haplotype diversity 0.77 ± 0.06 and
nucleotide diversity 0.0877±0.0054. northwestern vivax malaria population
exhibited extensive haplotype diversity (hd) pvmsp3β (hd=1.0). contrast,
the southern parasite population displayed single pvmsp3β allele (hd=0),
suggesting clonal population expansion. result revealed extent of
allelic diversity p. vivax populations thailand varies among endemic areas.
conclusion: malaria parasite populations given region may vary significantly
in genetic diversity, may result control influenced the
magnitude malaria transmission intensity. issue be
taken account implementation p. vivax control measures as
drug policy vaccine development.
