background: greater mekong sub-region, plasmodium vivax become the
predominant species imposes major challenge regional malaria
elimination. study aimed investigate variations genes potentially 
related drug resistance p. vivax populations china-myanmar border 
area. addition, study also wanted determine whether divergence existed
between parasite populations associated asymptomatic acute infections.
methods: total 66 p. vivax isolates obtained patients acute
malaria attended clinics laiza area, kachin state, myanmar 2015. in
addition, 102 p. vivax isolates associated asymptomatic infections were
identified screening volunteers without signs symptoms surrounding 
villages. slide-positive samples verified nested pcr detecting 18s 
rrna gene. multiclonal infections excluded genotyping msp-3α
and msp-3β genes. parasite dna 60 symptomatic cases 81 asymptomatic
infections used amplify sequence genes potentially associated with
drug resistance, including pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvk12.
results: pvmdr1 y976f f1076l mutations present 3/113 (2.7%) and
97/113 (85.5%) p. vivax isolates, respectively. k10 insertion pvcrt-o gene
was found 28.2% parasites. four mutations two antifolate
resistance genes reached relatively high levels prevalence: pvdhfr s58r
(53.4%), s117n/t (50.8%), pvdhps a383g (75.0%), a553g (36.3%). haplotypes
with wild-type pvmdr1 (976y/997k/1076f) quadruple mutations pvdhfr
(13i/57l/58r/61m/99h/117t/173i) significantly prevalent symptomatic 
than asymptomatic infections, whereas pvmdr1 mutant haplotype 976y/997k/1076l
was significantly prevalent asymptomatic symptomatic infections. 
addition, quadruple mutations codons 57, 58, 61 117 pvdhfr double
mutations codons 383 553 pvdhps found asymptomatic and
symptomatic infections similar frequencies. mutations found the
pvk12 gene.
conclusions: mutations pvdhfr pvdhps prevalent symptomatic
and asymptomatic p. vivax infections, suggestive resistance antifolate
drugs. asymptomatic carriers may act silent reservoir sustaining
drug-resistant parasite transmission necessitating rational strategy for
malaria elimination region.
