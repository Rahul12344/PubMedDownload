background: malaria elimination plan greater mekong subregion (gms) is
jeopardized increasing number plasmodium vivax infections emergence
of parasite strains reduced susceptibility frontline drug treatment
chloroquine/primaquine. study aimed determine evolution p.
vivax multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr1) gene p. vivax parasites isolated from
the china-myanmar border area major phase elimination.
methods: clinical isolates collected 275 p. vivax patients 2008,
2012-2013 2015 china-myanmar border area 55 patients in
central china. comparison made parasites three border regions of
thailand.
results: overall, genetic diversity pvmdr1 relatively high all
border regions, seven years china-myanmar border, though
slight temporal fluctuation observed. single nucleotide polymorphisms
previously implicated reduced chloroquine sensitivity detected. in
particular, m908l approached fixation china-myanmar border area. y976f
mutation sharply decreased 18.5% 2008 1.5% 2012-2013 and
disappeared 2015, whereas f1076l steadily increased 33.3% 2008 to
77.8% 2015. neutrality tests suggested action purifying selection
on pvmdr1 gene, several likelihood-based algorithms detected positive well
as purifying selections operating specific amino acids including m908l, t958m 
and f1076l. fixation selection nonsynonymous mutations differently
distributed across three border regions central china. comparison with
the global p. vivax populations clearly indicated clustering haplotypes
according geographic locations. noteworthy temperate-zone
parasites central china completely separated parasites from
other parts gms.
conclusions: study showed p. vivax populations china-myanmar
border experienced major changes pvmdr1 residues proposed be
associated chloroquine resistance, suggesting drug selection may play
an important role evolution gene parasite populations.
