for reasons remain unknown, plasmodium falciparum genome an
exceptionally high content compared plasmodium species eukaryotes
in general - nearly 80% coding regions approaching 90% non-coding
regions. here, examine phenomenon relates genome-wide patterns 
de novo mutation. mutation accumulation experiments performed sequential 
cloning six p. falciparum isolates growing human erythrocytes vitro 
4 years, 279 clones sampled whole genome sequencing different time
points. genome sequence analysis samples revealed significant excess
of g:c a:t transitions compared types nucleotide substitution,
which would naturally cause content equilibrate close level seen
across p. falciparum reference genome (80.6% at). data also uncover 
extremely high rate small indel mutation relative species, primarily 
associated repetitive at-rich sequences, addition larger-scale
structural rearrangements focused antigen-coding var genes. conclusion,
high content p. falciparum driven systematic mutational bias and
ultimately leads unusual level microstructural plasticity, raising the
question whether contributes adaptive evolution.
