research complex genetic underpinnings malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum entering new era arrival site-specific
genome engineering. previously restricted model systems expanded 
to laboratory organisms, even humans experimental gene therapy
studies, technology allows researchers rapidly generate previously
unattainable genetic modifications. technological advance dependent on
dna double-strand break repair (dsbr), specifically homologous recombination in
the case plasmodium. understanding dsbr malaria parasites, however, 
is based largely assumptions knowledge taken model systems,
which always hold true plasmodium. describe causes of
double-strand breaks, mechanisms dsbr, differences model
systems p. falciparum. mechanisms drive basic parasite functions, 
as meiosis, antigen diversification, copy number variation, allow the
parasite continually evolve contexts host immune pressure drug
selection. finally, discuss new technologies leverage dsbr mechanisms
to accelerate genetic investigations global infectious pathogen.
