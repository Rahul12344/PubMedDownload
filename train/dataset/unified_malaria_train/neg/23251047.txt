the human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum one world's most
devastating pathogen. capability regulate genes various stages
of life cycle well unfavourable environmental conditions led 
to development vaccine resistant strains. similarly, drug pressure
it develops mutations target genes. mutations confer mid and
high-level resistance antimalarial drugs. increasing resistance of
malaria parasites conventional antimalarial drugs important factor
contributing persistence disease major health threat. this
article reviews current knowledge stage specific malarial targets,
antimalarial drugs mutations led emergence resistant 
strains.
