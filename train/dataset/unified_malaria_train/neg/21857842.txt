background: resistance antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp)
emerged plasmodium falciparum asia 1960s subsequently spread
to africa. tanzania, sp use national policy began 1983 second
line chloroquine (cq) treatment uncomplicated malaria, august
2001 approved replace cq national first line.
objective: present study assesses frequency resistant dhfr dhps
alleles morogoro-mvomero district south eastern tanzania contrast their
rate change 17 years sp second line use five years sp
first line use.
methodology: cross sectional surveys asymptomatic infections carried 
at end rainy season july-september 2000, sp the
national second line (cq first line) 2006 sp national
first line antimalarial treatment. genetic analysis sp resistance genes was
carried 1,044 asymptomatic infections effect two policies
on sp evolution compared.
results: frequency resistant allele, double dhps-triple dhfr 
mutant genotype, increased 1% 17 years sp second line use, 
there dramatic increase 45% five years sp first line use.
conclusion: conclude national policy change second line first
line sp, brought immediate shift treatment practice turn 
had highly significant impact drug pressure. use sp specific
programs intermittent preventive treatment infants (ipti) and
intermittent preventive treatment pregnant women (iptp) likely
reduce substantially sp selection pressure sp resistance alleles alike.
