the malaria parasite exports numerous proteins host red blood cell
(rbc). trafficking exported effectors complex. proteins first
routed secretory system, parasitophorous vacuole (pv), a
membranous compartment enclosing parasite. proteins translocated
across pv membrane process requiring atp unfolding. rbc 
compartment exported proteins refolded trafficked to
their final localizations. chaperones important unfolding and
refolding processes. recently, suggested parasite tric chaperonin
complex exported, involved trafficking exported
effectors. using parasite-specific antibody epitope-tagged transgenic
parasites could observe export plasmodium tric rbc. tested
the importance parasite tric creating regulatable knockdown line of
the tric-θ subunit. loss parasite tric-θ led severe growth defect 
asexual development, alter protein export rbc. these
observations indicate tric proteins play critical role parasite
biology, though function, within parasite, appears unrelated protein
trafficking rbc compartment.
