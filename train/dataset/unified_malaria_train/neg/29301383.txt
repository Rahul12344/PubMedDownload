artemisinin natural sesquiterpene lactone obtained artemisia annua 
herb. widely used treatment malaria. article, have
reviewed role artemisinin controlling malaria, spread resistance 
artemisinin different methods used large scale production. the
highest amount artemisinin gene expression tobacco leaf chloroplast leads
to production 0.8 mg/g dry weight plant. will
revolutionize treatment control malaria third world countries.
furthermore, generations novel derivatives artemisinin- trioxane
ring structure-inspired compounds important treatment malaria
caused resistant plasmodial species. synthetic endoperoxide-like artefenomel
and derivatives crucial control malaria synthetic
compounds explored.
