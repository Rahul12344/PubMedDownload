background: well established infection plasmodium vivax result
of host-parasite interactions. present study, association il1/il2
cytokine profiles, anticircumsporozoite protein antibody levels parasitic
loads evaluated individuals naturally infected p. vivax endemic
area brazilian amazon.
methods: molecular diagnosis p. vivax variants performed using the
pcr-rflp method il1b -511c>t, il2 -330t>g il2+114t>g polymorphisms were
identified using pcr-rflp allele-specific pcr. il-1β il-2 cytokine levels
were detected flow cytometry circumsporozoite protein (csp) antibodies
were measured elisa.
results: three variants p. vivax csp identified vk247 found be
the frequent. however, prevalence magnitude igg antibodies were
higher vk210 variant. furthermore, antibody response csp
variants associated presence variant infection.
significant differences observed single nucleotide polymorphism 
(snp) -511t>c il1b gene levels antibodies vk247 p.
vivax-like variants, associations snps il1 il2
genes plasma products.
conclusions: individuals rs16944 cc genotype il1β gene have
higher antibody levels csp p. vivax vk247 p. vivax-like
variants.
