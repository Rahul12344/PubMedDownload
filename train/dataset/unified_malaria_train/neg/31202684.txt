sexual development malaria parasites involves multiple signal transduction
pathways mediated reversible protein phosphorylation. here, functionally
characterised protein phosphatase, ser/thr protein phosphatase 5 (pbpp5),
during sexual development rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. 
recombinant protein phosphatase domain displayed obvious protein phosphatase
activity sensitive pp1/pp2a inhibitors including cantharidic acid
(ic50 = 122.2 nm), cantharidin (ic50 = 74.3 nm), endothall (ic50 = 365.5 nm) 
okadaic acid (ic50 = 1.3 nm). pbpp5 expressed blood stages and
ookinetes prominent expression sexual development. pbpp5 was
localised cytoplasm parasite highly concentrated beneath the
parasite plasma membrane free merozoites ookinetes. targeted deletion of
the pbpp5 gene influence asexual blood-stage parasite multiplication or
the survival curve infected hosts. however, male gamete formation and
fertility severely affected, resulting almost complete blockade of
ookinete conversion oocyst development δpbpp5 lines. sexual
development defect rescued crossing δpbpp5 female defective
δpbs47 parasite line, male defective δpbs48/45 line, thus
confirming essential function pbpp5 gene male gamete fertility.
furthermore, aforementioned pp1/pp2a inhibitors inhibitory effects on
exflagellation male gametocytes ookinete conversion. particular,
endothall, selective inhibitor pp2a, completely blocked exflagellation and
ookinete conversion ∼548.3 nm. study elucidated essential function 
pbpp5 male gamete development fertility.
