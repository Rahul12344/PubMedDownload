nucleotide variation patterns across species shaped processes of
natural selection, including exposure environmental pathogens. examined

tested immune phenotypes. screen results strongly predictive for
genes protective immune phenotypes: genes meeting screen criteria were
significantly likely display functional phenotype malaria
infection genes meeting criteria (p = 0.0005). thus, an
evolution-based screen efficiently prioritize candidate genes for
labor-intensive downstream functional testing, safely allow elimination
