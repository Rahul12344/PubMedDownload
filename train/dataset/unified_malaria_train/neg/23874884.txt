that dc5-containing pfemp1 (dc5-pfemp1) likely expressed in

sequence characteristic dc5, show two genetically different parasite

we confirm anti-dc5 antibodies acquired early life individuals
living malaria endemic areas, individuals high levels these
antibodies less likely develop febrile malaria episodes the
antibody levels correlate positively hemoglobin levels.
