background: ability human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum to
invade, colonise multiply within diverse host environments, well to
manifest virulence within human host, activities tightly linked to
the temporal spatial control gene expression. yet, despite wealth of
high throughput transcriptomic data available organism very
little information regarding location key transcriptional landmarks or
their associated cis-acting regulatory elements. provide systematic
exploration size organisation transcripts within intergenic regions
to yield surrogate information regarding transcriptional landmarks, also
explore spatial temporal organisation transcripts poorly
characterised genomic regions.
results: utilising transcript data cohort 105 genes demonstrate
that untranscribed regions mrna large apportioned predominantly to
the 5' end open reading frame. given relatively compact size p.
falciparum genome, suggest whilst transcriptional units likely to
spatially overlap, temporal co-transcription adjacent transcriptional units is
actually limited. critically, size intergenic regions directly
dependent orientation two transcriptional units arrayed them, 
an observation extend analysis complete sequences twelve
additional organisms share moderately compact genomes.
conclusions: study provides theoretical framework extends current 
understanding transcriptional landscape across p. falciparum genome.
