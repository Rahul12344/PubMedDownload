background: genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) parasites 
is major hurdle control malaria. study monitored changes 
genetic diversity multiplicity p. falciparum parasite infection in
asymptomatic children living southern ghana 3 month intervals april
2015 january 2016.
methods: filter paper blood spots (dbs) collected quarterly children
living obom, community perennial malaria transmission abura, a
community seasonal malaria transmission. genomic dna extracted 
dbs used polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based genotyping merozoite
surface protein 1 (msp 1) merozoite surface protein 2 (msp 2) genes.
results: total 787 samples collected two study
sites, 59.2% (466/787) tested positive p. falciparum. msp 1 msp 2
genes successfully amplified 73.8% (344/466) 82.5% (385/466) the
p. falciparum positive samples respectively. geometric mean moi abura
ranged 1.17 (95% ci: 1.08-1.28) 1.48 (95% ci: 1.36-1.60) was
significantly lower (p < 0.01, dunn's multiple comparison test) that
determined obom, geometric mean moi ranged 1.82 (95% ci:
1.58-2.08) 2.50 (95% ci: 2.33-2.678) study period. whilst msp 1 
r033:mad20:ki allelic family ratio dynamic, msp 2 3d7:fc27 allelic family
ratio remained relatively stable across changing seasons sites.
conclusions: study shows seasonal variations parasite diversity in
these communities better estimated msp 1 rather msp 2 due the
constantly changing relative intra allelic frequencies observed msp 1 
fact dominance msp 2 allele dependent transmission
setting season opposed dominance msp 1 allele,
which dependent season transmission setting.
