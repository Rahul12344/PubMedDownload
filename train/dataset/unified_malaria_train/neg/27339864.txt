background: transfusion-transmitted malaria (ttm) studied with
molecular means hyperendemic areas assumed occur frequently.
the african investigation mirasol system (aims) trial provided the
opportunity study ttm standard whole blood (wb) units.
study design methods: plasmodium genome transfused wb units and
patient samples transfusion 1, 3, 7, 28 days after
transfusion screened quantified using real-time polymerase chain
reaction. parasitemic samples confirmed, three alleles sequenced, and
the percentage homology determined paired wb units patient
samples. anti-plasmodium titers quantified serial dilution. clinical
symptoms microscopic detection malaria monitored.
results: microscopy negative 3 × 10(6) genome copies/ml. thirty-seven
patients nonparasitemic transfusion exposed parasitemic
wb. amount plasmodium genome load transfused ranged 0.1 × 10(6)
and 2.0 × 10(9) copies. parasite load received transfusion 13
patients ttm higher received patients without ttm
(p = 0.01). patients single parasitemic posttransfusion sample not
considered ttm. four elements critical predict outcome emerged:
parasite load, patient anti-plasmodium titer pretransfusion, percentage clearance
of parasites day 1, level anti-plasmodium humoral immune response. four
patients ttm became parasite-free day 28 (effective control), four
patients ttm maintained relatively stable levels parasitemia (uncertain
control), five patients reached high levels parasitemia day 28
posttransfusion, indicating ineffective control malarial infection by
semi-immune individuals.
conclusions: ttm endemic areas relatively frequent (13 112 donations;
11.6%) and, although largely controlled semi-immunity recipient patients,
may require antimalarial treatment.
