background: drug resistance malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
severely compromises treatment control malaria. knowledge the
critical mutations conferring resistance particular drugs important in
understanding modes drug action mechanisms resistances. are
required design better therapies limit drug resistance.a mutation the
gene (pfcrt) encoding membrane transporter identified principal
determinant chloroquine resistance p. falciparum, lack full
account higher level chloroquine resistance. furthermore, determinants 
resistance major human malaria parasite, p. vivax, known. to
address questions, investigated genetic basis chloroquine
resistance isogenic lineage rodent malaria parasite p. chabaudi which
high level resistance chloroquine progressively selected under
laboratory conditions.
results: loci containing critical genes mapped linkage group
selection, using genetic cross high-level chloroquine-resistant
mutant genetically distinct sensitive strain. novel high-resolution
quantitative whole-genome re-sequencing approach used reveal three regions
of selection chr11, chr03 chr02 appear progressively increasing
drug doses three chromosomes. whole-genome sequencing the
chloroquine-resistant parent identified four point mutations different
genes chromosomes. three mutations located foci the
selection valleys therefore predicted confer different levels of
chloroquine resistance. critical mutation conferring first level of
chloroquine resistance found aat1, putative aminoacid transporter.
conclusions: quantitative trait loci conferring selectable phenotypes, as
drug resistance, mapped directly using progressive genome-wide linkage
group selection. quantitative genome-wide short-read genome resequencing be
used reveal signatures drug selection high resolution. the
identities three genes (and mutations within them) conferring different levels
of chloroquine resistance generate insights regarding genetic architecture
and mechanisms resistance chloroquine drugs. importantly, their
orthologues may evaluated critical accessory roles chloroquine
resistance human malarias p. vivax p. falciparum.
