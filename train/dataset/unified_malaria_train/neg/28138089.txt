objective: determine polymorphisms 3' untranslated region (3'utr)
of g6pd gene analyze specific snps haplotypes may affect
messenger rna (mrna) secondary structure silico analysis.
methods: studied 3'utr polymorphisms 107 healthy subjects living in
thailand (ethnicities unknown). haplotype analyzed using haploview
software. mrna secondary structure microrna binding g6pd gene were
predicted use clc main workbench 6.9 regrna 2.0 programs.
results: results revealed 1 new variant 3'utr g6pd gene
(c.*99a > g). haplotype atcg showed significance association-test results that
yielded high odds ratio (or, 7.90; 95% confidence interval [ci], 3.15-19.81).
moreover, haplotype affected g6pd mrna secondary structure changes and
microrna binding via silico analysis.
conclusions: results suggest haplotype atcg associated with
reduction g6pd enzyme expression, g6pd mrna secondary structure changes, and
microrna binding via silico analysis.
