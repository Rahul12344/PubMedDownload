background: polymorphisms within pfatp6 gene indicated potential
molecular markers artemisinin efficacy. since 2004, use artemisinin
combination therapy (act) introduced first-line treatment the
uncomplicated malaria cases suriname. aim research to
determine changes suriname status polymorphic markers the
pfatp6 gene adoption act-regimen, particularly the
s769n mutation, reported associated vitro artemether
resistance neighboring country french guiana.
methods: pfatp6 gene plasmodium falciparum parasites suriname was
investigated 28 samples using pcr amplification restriction enzyme
analysis, assess determine prevalence potentially interesting
single nucleotide polymorphisms. polymorphisms [l263e; a623e; s769n], which
may associated artemisinin resistant phenotype characterized 
parasites three endemic regions adoption the
act-regimen. addition, status molecular markers compared in
paired p. falciparum isolates patients recurring malaria after
controlled act.
results: investigated samples exhibit wild-type genotype three
positions; l263, a623, s769.
conclusion: investigated isolates adoption the
act-regimen independent endemic region harbored wild-type genotype for
the three investigated polymorphisms. study revealed decreased
artemisinin susceptibility could occur independent pfatp6 mutations,
challenging assumption artemisinin resistance associated these
mutations pfatp6 gene.
