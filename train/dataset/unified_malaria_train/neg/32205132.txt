transmission plasmodium vivax still persist malaysia despite the
government's aim eliminate malaria 2020. high treatment failure rate of
chloroquine monotherapy reported recently. hence, parasite drug
susceptibility kept close monitoring. mutation analysis the
drug resistance markers useful reconnaissance anti-malarial drug
resistance. hitherto, information p. vivax drug resistance marker malaysia 
are limited. study aims evaluate mutations four p. vivax drug
resistance markers pvcrt-o (putative), pvmdr1 (putative), pvdhfr pvdhps 44
isolates malaysia. finding indicates 27.3%, 100%, 47.7%, 27.3% of
the isolates carrying mutant allele pvcrt-o, pvmdr1, pvdhfr pvdhps
genes, respectively. mutant isolates multiple point mutations
rather single point mutation pvmdr1 (41/44) pvdhfr (19/21). one novel
point mutation v111i detected pvdhfr. allelic combination analysis shows
significant strong association mutations pvcrt-o pvmdr1
(x2 = 9.521, p < 0.05). present study, 65.9% patients are
non-malaysians, arrived malaysia 1-2 weeks onset
of clinical manifestations, previous history malaria infection.
besides, malaysian patients travel history vivax-endemic countries,
suggesting patients might acquired infections their
travel. possible imported cases could placed malaysia risk to
have local transmission outbreak malaria. six isolates found have
mutations four drug resistance markers, suggesting multiple-drugs
resistant p. vivax strains circulating malaysia.
