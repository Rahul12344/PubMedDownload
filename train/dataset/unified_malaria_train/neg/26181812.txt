background: kaposi sarcoma (ks)-associated herpesvirus cd4 t-cell 
lymphopenia, mechanisms responsible ks context hiv poorly
understood. one recently explored pathway hiv pathogenesis involves induction 
of enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (ido), catabolizes tryptophan
into kynurenine several immunologically active metabolites that
suppress t-cell proliferation. investigated role ido development
of ks hiv disease.
methods: case-control study among untreated hiv-infected ugandans, cases
were adults ks controls without ks. ido activity assessed by
the ratio plasma kynurenine tryptophan levels (kt ratio), measured by
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
results: studied 631 hiv-infected subjects: 222 ks cases 409 controls.
non-ks controls higher median plasma kt ratio (130, interquartile range: 90
to 190 nm/μm) ks cases (110, interquartile range: 90 150 nm/μm) (p =
0.004). adjustment age, sex, cd4 count, plasma hiv rna level,
subjects highest (fourth quartile) plasma kt ratios 59% reduction 
(95% confidence interval: 27% 77%) odds ks compared 
the lowest (first quartile) levels. ks also independently associated with
lower cd4 count, higher plasma hiv rna, men.
conclusions: among hiv-infected individuals, greater activity kynurenine
pathway tryptophan catabolism, evidenced higher levels plasma kt
ratio, associated lower occurrence ks. consequences immune
activation hiv infection might actually suppress certain cancers.
