background: malaria caused plasmodium vivax widely
distributed human malaria. recent resurgence many parts world,
including republic korea (rok), emphasizes importance improved
access early accurate detection p. vivax reduce disease burden. 
in study, rapid efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(lamp)-based method developed validated using blood samples from
malaria-suspected patients.
method: lamp assay targeting α-tubulin gene detection p. vivax
was developed six primers recognize different regions target
gene. diagnostic performance α-tubulin lamp assay compared to
three tests: microscopic examinations, rapid diagnostic tests (rdts), and
nested polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) using 177 whole blood specimens obtained
from rok military personnel may december 2011.
results: α-tubulin lamp assay highly sensitive detection limit 
100 copies p. vivax α-tubulin gene per reaction within 50 min. specifically
amplified target gene p. vivax. validation α-tubulin lamp
assay showed assay highest sensitivity (p < 0.001 versus
microscopy; p = 0.0023 versus rdt) nested pcr used gold standard 
and better agreement (concordance: 94.9%, kappa value: 0.865) nested pcr
than rdt microscopy. receiver operation characteristics analysis showed
that diagnostic accuracy α-tubulin lamp assay vivax malaria was
higher (area curve = 0.908) rdt microscopy.
conclusion: study showed p. vivax α-tubulin lamp assay, can
be used diagnose early infections vivax malaria, alternative
molecular diagnostic tool point-of-care test may help prevent
transmission endemic areas.
