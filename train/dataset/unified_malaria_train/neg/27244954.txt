monitoring multidrug-resistant (mdr)falciparum vivax malaria recently 
been included global plan artemisinin resistance containment (gparc)
of greater mekong sub-region, particularly thailand-cambodia and
thailand-myanmar borders. parallel gparc, monitoring mdr malaria parasites 
in anopheline vectors ideal augment entomological surveillance.
employing plasmodium- species-specific nested pcr techniques, p. vivax
was detected 3/109 salivary gland dna extracts anopheline vectors collected
during rainy season 24-26 august 2009 22-24 september 2009 a
dry season 29-31 december 2009 16-18 january 2010. indoor out-
door resting mosquitoes collected thong pha phum district, kanchanaburi
province (border thailand-myanmar) bo rai district, trat province (border 
of thailand-cambodia): one sample anopheles dirus thailand-cambodia
border two samples an. aconitus thailand-myanmar border isolate.
nucleotide sequencing dihydrofolate reductase gene revealed presence in
all three samples four mutations known cause high resistance antifolate 
pyrimethamine, mutations found multidrug resistance transporter 1 
gene associated (falciparum) resistance quinoline antimalarials.
such findings indicate potential usefulness approach monitoring
the prevalence drug-resistant malaria parasites geographically regions
prone development drug resistance screening human
population risk poses logistical ethical problems. keywords: anopheles
