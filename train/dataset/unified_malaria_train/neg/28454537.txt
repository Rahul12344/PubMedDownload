background: pregnant women high-risk group plasmodium falciparum
infections, may result maternal anaemia low birth weight newborns,
among adverse birth outcomes. intermittent preventive treatment with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine pregnancy (iptp-sp) widely implemented to
prevent negative effects malaria. however, resistance sp p.
falciparum may decrease efficacy iptp-sp. combinations point mutations in
the dhps (codons a437, k540) dhfr genes (codons n51, c59, s108) p.
falciparum associated sp resistance. study prevalence sp 
resistance mutations determined among p. falciparum found pregnant women
and general population (gp) nanoro, burkina faso association 
iptp-sp dosing variables mutations studied.
methods: blood spots filter papers collected pregnant women their
first antenatal care visit (anc booking) delivery, ongoing trial
and gp cross-sectional survey. dhps dhfr genes were
amplified nested pcr products sequenced identify mutations
conferring resistance (anc booking, n = 400; delivery, n = 223; gp, n = 400).
prevalence estimated generalized estimating equations for
multivariate analyses mixed effects logistic regression used.
results: prevalence triple dhfr mutation high, significantly
higher gp delivery anc booking, affect birth
weight. furthermore, quintuple mutations (triple dhfr double dhps mutations) 
were found first time burkina faso. iptp-sp significantly
affect occurrence mutations, high transmission season was
associated increased mutation prevalence delivery samples. unclear 
why prevalence mutations higher gp pregnant women at
anc booking.
conclusion: high number mutants presence quintuple mutants in
burkina faso confirm concerns efficacy iptp-sp near future.
other drug combinations tackle malaria pregnancy should, therefore, be
explored. increase mutation prevalence due iptp-sp dosing could be
confirmed.
