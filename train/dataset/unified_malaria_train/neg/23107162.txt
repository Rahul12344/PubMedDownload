background: rapid diagnosis plasmodium falciparum infections important
because potentially fatal complications. sdfk90 recently marketed
malaria rapid diagnostic test (rdt) targeting histidine-rich protein 2
(pfhrp2) p. falciparum-specific plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pf-pldh).
the present study evaluated diagnostic accuracy.
methods: sdfk90 tested panel stored whole blood samples (n= 591)
obtained international travellers suspected malaria, including four
human plasmodium species plasmodium negative samples. microscopy used 
a reference method, corrected pcr species diagnosis. addition, sdfk90
was challenged 59 p. falciparum samples parasite density ≥4% to
assess prozone effect (no weak visible line initial testing a
higher intensity upon 10-fold dilution).
results: overall sensitivity detection p. falciparum 98.5% and
reached 99.3% parasite densities >100/μl. significantly pfhrp2
lines visible compared pf-pldh (97.3% vs 86.9%), mainly absent at
parasite densities <100/μl. specificity sdfk90 98.8%. lot-to-lot
variability observed (p = 1.00) test results reproducible. prozone
effect seen pfhrp2 line 14/59 (23.7%) p. falciparum samples
tested, pf-pldh line. minor shortcomings observed the
kit's packaging information insert.
conclusions: sdfk90 performed excellent p. falciparum diagnosis. the
combination pfhrp2 pf-pldh ensures low detection threshold counters 
potential problems pfhrp2 detection gene deletions prozone
effect.
