earlier studies plasmodium apoptosis revealed presence proteases with
caspases like- activity, known "metacaspases". although family 
of cysteine proteases structurally similar caspases cys-his dyad but
their evolutionary significance functional relevance remains largely unknown.
these proteases considered important target malaria due to
their absence humans. report, biochemically characterized
metacaspase-2 (pfmca-2) p.falciparum. enzymatic assay showed pfmca-2
efficiently cleaved arginine/lysine specific peptide, caspase-specific
substrate. consistently, pfmca-2 activity sensitive effector caspases
inhibitor, z-fa-fmk, mildly inhibited aprotinin e-64. however, general
caspase inhibitors z-vad-fmk z-devd-fmk effect pfmca-2
activity. z-fa-fmk inhibits parasite growth ic50 value 2.7 μm along
with notable morphological changes. pfmca-2 specifically expressed in
schizonts gametocyte stages notable depletion pfmca-2
expression z-fa-fmk treated schizonts gametocytes stages parasite.
notably, pfmca-2 cleaves phylogenetically conserved protein, tsn (tudor
staphylococcal nuclease) proteolysis pftsn occur after
treatment z-fa-fmk. production large amount reactive oxygen
species presence z-fa-fmk caused oxidative stress turn leads to
loss cell viability. oxidative stress generates positive feedback 
for occurrence cell death term phosphatidylserine externalization
and dna fragmentation vitro.
