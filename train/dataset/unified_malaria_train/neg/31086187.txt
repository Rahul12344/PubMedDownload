plasmodium sexual differentiation required malaria transmission, yet much 
remains unknown regulation. here, quantify early
gametocyte-committed ring (gc-ring) stage, p. falciparum parasites 260
uncomplicated malaria patient blood samples 10 days maturation to
transmissible stage v gametocytes using gametocyte conversion assay (gca).
seventy six percent samples gc-rings, ratio gametocyte 
asexual-committed rings (gcr) varies widely (0-78%). gcr correlates positively
with parasitemia negatively influenced fever, hematocrit, age or
leukocyte counts. higher expression levels gdv1-dependent genes, ap2-g, msrp1 
and gexp5, well gdv1 allele encoding h217 associated high gcr,
while high plasma lysophosphatidylcholine levels associated low gcr in
the second study year. results provide view sexual differentiation in
the field suggest key regulatory roles clinical factors gdv1 in
gametocytogenesis vivo.
