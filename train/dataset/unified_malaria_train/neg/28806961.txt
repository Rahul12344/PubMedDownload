background: artemisinin resistance present greater mekong region and
poses significant threat current anti-malarial treatment guidelines in
bangladesh. aim molecular study assess current status of
drug resistance chittagong hill tracts bangladesh near myanmar
border.
methods: samples obtained patients enrolled clinical trial
(nct02389374) conducted alikadam, bandarban august 2014 january
2015. plasmodium falciparum infections confirmed pcr p.
falciparum positive isolates genotyped pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y
markers. propeller region kelch 13 (k13) gene sequenced from
isolates patients delayed parasite clearance.
results: total, 130 p. falciparum isolates available analysis. the
pfcrt mutation k76t, associated chloroquine resistance found 81.5%
(106/130) cases pfmdr1 mutation n86y 13.9% (18/130) cases. no
single nucleotide polymorphisms observed k13 propeller region.
conclusion: study provides molecular evidence ongoing presence of
chloroquine resistant p. falciparum bangladesh, evidence mutations
in k13 propeller domain associated artemisinin resistance. monitoring
for artemisinin susceptibility bangladesh needed ensure early detection 
and containment emerging anti-malarial resistance.
