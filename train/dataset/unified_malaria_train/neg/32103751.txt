background: mizoram, northeastern state india, shares international borders 
with myanmar bangladesh considered one key routes through
which drug-resistant parasites southeast asia enter mainland india. despite
its strategic location importance, malaria epidemiology molecular status 
of chloroquine resistance well documented, since chloroquine
(cq), first-line treatment plasmodium falciparum infection was
discontinued since 2008, expected cq-sensitive haplotype would be
more abundant.
methods: malaria epidemiology data period 2010 2018 collected from
the office state vector disease control programme. plasmodium
falciparum-positive blood samples collected government district
hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, sub-centres, and
diagnostic centres six malaria-prone districts. samples processed
and analysed using genes-p. falciparum chloroquine-resistant transporter (pfcrt) 
and p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) via sequencing pcr amplicon 
from 2015 2017.
results: malaria occurred throughout year p. falciparum accounted
for > 89% total malaria cases. 2010-2018, highest number malaria
incidence recorded lawngtlai (36% total malaria cases; average
api2010-2018 34.8) champhai remained consistently low (0.4%; average
api2010-2018 0.04). males ≥ 15 years old contributed maximum (35.7%) among 
gender age malarial distribution recorded 2014-2018. death due to
malaria gradually decreased years. higher abundance mutated pfcrt
(58.5% total sample analysed) lower prevalence mutated pfmdr1
(48.7%) observed. mutations identified pfcrt belong southeast
asian cviet haplotype. single point mutation observed 86 (n → y)
position pfmdr1 (48.7%). key n86y mutation pfmdr1 shown
to modulate cqr found 67.1% samples positive cviet
haplotype.
conclusions: first report details malaria epidemiology also 
the molecular status cq-resistance p. falciparum population region. 
the efforts state vector borne disease control programme proved be
quite effective controlling malaria burden state. despite the
discontinuation cq decade, local p. falciparum observed with
decreased cq-sensitive haplotype. believed present findings will
form basis studies genetic diversity p. falciparum, which
could confer better understanding complexity disease southeast
asia.
