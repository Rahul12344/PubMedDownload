chronic infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) remains significant
worldwide medical problem. diseases caused hiv infection, tuberculosis
and malaria decline, new cases chronic hepatitis b rise.
because often fatal complications cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma are
associated chronic hepatitis b, need cure urgent ever.
currently licensed therapeutics fail eradicate virus is
attributable persistence viral replication intermediate comprising
covalently closed circular dna (cccdna). elimination inactivation viral
cccdna thus goal research aimed hepatitis b cure. ability to
engineer nucleases capable specific cleavage dna sequence now
provides means disable cccdna permanently. scientific literature is
replete many examples using designer zinc finger nucleases (zfns),
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (talens) rna-guided
endonucleases (rgens) inactivate hbv. however, important concerns about
safety, dose control efficient delivery need addressed the
technology employed clinical setting. use vitro transcribed mrna to
express therapeutic gene editors goes way overcoming concerns. 
labile nature rna limits off-target effects enables dose control.
compatibility hepatotropic non-viral vectors convenient large
scale preparation required advancing gene editing mode of
curing chronic hepatitis b.
