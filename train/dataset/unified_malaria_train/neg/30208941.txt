background: babesia bigemina b. bovis two economically important
hemoparasites affecting cattle buffaloes involved dairy beef
production. colombia, although parasitological serological studies
suggest endemicity pathogens areas 1000 m, little known
about molecular prevalence different host. objective study was
to estimate prevalence molecular traits parasites cattle 
buffaloes two colombian regions.
methods: 2014 2016, three-point longitudinal survey designed in
farms caribbean orinoquia regions evaluate molecular prevalence
of b. bigemina b. bovis using nested pcr (n-pcr) targeting hypothetical
protein (hyp) rhoptry-associated protein (rap-1) genes, respectively. total
of 1432 cattle, 152 buffalo 1439 rhipicephalus microplus samples were
analyzed. moreover, phylogenetic relationship isolates analyzed using 
18s rrna gene.
results: molecular prevalence 31.6% (24.2% b. bigemina 14.4% b. 
bovis), 23.6% (6.5% b. bigemina 17.7% b. bovis) 4.3% (3.5% b.
bigemina 1.0% b. bovis) observed cattle, buffaloes and
rhipicephalus microplus, respectively. higher values infection observed
during wet season late wet season; nevertheless, variables 
age, production type, sex, breed babesiosis control also significantly
associated infection. prevalence analysis showed b. bovis infection was
higher cattle coexist buffaloes, compared did
not. species, phylogenetic analyses revealed high genetic diversity of
isolates without clusters related isolation source.
conclusions: knowledge, first longitudinal survey that
evaluates molecular methods, infection b. bigemina b. bovis in
two important livestock regions colombia. study reveals the
prevalence infection babesia spp., cattle buffaloes modulated by
seasonal variations, host factors vector traits. results provide new
insights epidemiological aspects infection babesia spp., cattle
and buffaloes, must taken consideration babesiosis control
programs implemented study area.
