efforts control malignant malaria caused plasmodium falciparum hampered
by parasite's acquisition resistance antimalarial drugs, e.g.,
chloroquine. necessitates evaluating spread chloroquine resistance in
any malaria-endemic area. india displays highly variable malaria epidemiology and
also shares porous international borders malaria-endemic southeast asian
countries multi-drug resistant malaria. malaria epidemiology india is
believed affected two major factors: high genetic diversity evolving
drug resistance p. falciparum. transmission intensity malaria can
influence genetic structure chloroquine-resistant p. falciparum population
in india unknown. here, genetic diversity within among p. falciparum
populations analyzed respect prevalence chloroquine
resistance observed 13 different locations india. microsatellites developed
for p. falciparum, including three putatively neutral seven microsatellites
thought hitchhiking effect due chloroquine selection used. 
genetic hitchhiking observed five seven microsatellites flanking the
gene responsible chloroquine resistance. genetic admixture analysis and
f-statistics detected genetically distinct groups accordance transmission
intensity different locations probable use chloroquine. large
genetic break chloroquine-resistant parasite the
northeast-east-island group southwest group (fst=0.253, p<0.001) suggests a
long period isolation possibility different origin them. a
pattern significant isolation distance observed low transmission
areas (r=0.49, p=0.003, n=83, mantel test). unanticipated pattern spread of
hitchhiking suggests genetic structure indian p. falciparum population.
overall, study suggests transmission intensity efficient
driver genetic differentiation neutral adaptive loci across
india.
