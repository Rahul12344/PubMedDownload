background: plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and
dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) mutations compromise effectiveness of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) treatment uncomplicated malaria, are
likely impair efficiency intermittent preventive treatment during
pregnancy (iptp). study conducted determine level of
pfdhfr-pfdhps mutations, decade since sp limited iptp use pregnant
women tanzania.
methods: p. falciparum genomic dna extracted dried blood spots prepared 
from finger prick. extracted dna sequenced using single miseq lane by
combining pcr products. genotyping pfdhfr pfdhps mutations done
using bcftools whereas custom scripts used filter translate genotypes
into sp resistance haplotypes.
results: pfdhfr analyzed 445 samples, wild type (wt) pfdhfr
haplotype ncsi detected 6 (1.3%) samples. triple pfdhfrirni (mutations are
bolded underlined) haplotype dominant, contributing 84% (number
[n] = 374) haplotypes 446 samples studied pfdhps, wt pfdhps
(sakaa) found 6.7% (n = 30) samples. double pfdhps haplotype (sgeaa)
accounted 83% mutations pfdhps gene. 447 pfdhfr-pfdhps combined 
genotypes, 0.9% (n = 4) samples contained wt gene (sakaa-ncsi). quintuple
(five) mutations, sgeaa-irni accounted 71.4% (n = 319) whereas 0.2% (n = 1)
had septuple (seven) mutations (agkgs-irni). overall prevalence pfdhfr
k540e 90.4% (n = 396) pfdhps a581g 1.1% (n = 5).
conclusions: study found high prevalence pfdhfr-pfdhps quintuple and
presence septuple mutations. mutations pfdhfr k540e pfdhps a581g, major
predictors iptp-sp failure within recommended range. abandonment
of iptp-sp recommended settings pfdhfr k540e prevalence > 95% 
and pfdhps a581g > 10% sp likely effective. nonetheless,
saturation pfdhfr pfdhps haplotypes alarming, search alternative 
antimalarial drug iptp study area recommended.
