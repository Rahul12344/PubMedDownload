clinical application oxaliplatin, platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, 
cancer, especially colorectal cancer, widely used. however,
oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (oipn) high incidence, 
date, detailed studies pathogenesis treatment
mechanisms. present study performed using proteomic approach to
explore protein expression profiling rats treated oxaliplatin by
multiplex isobaric tags relative absolute quantification labeling and
two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 74
proteins showed different expression sciatic nerve control rats
and oipn model rats, 53 upregulated proteins 21 downregulated proteins
detected oipn groups compared control groups. basis gene
ontology clustering, proteins associated biological processes
(eg, muscle contraction, muscle system process, skeletal muscle contraction),
cellular component (eg, myofibril, contractile fiber, contractile fiber part)
and molecular function (structural constituent muscle, hydro-lyase activity,
and calcium ion binding). basis kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes
pathway database, proteins associated african trypanosomiasis,
malaria, nitrogen metabolism, etc. real-time polymerase chain reaction, western
blot well immunohistochemistry analysis performed examine the
expression partially differential protein. conclusion, study
establishes protein expression profile oxaliplatin-induced rats and
mechanisms leading oipn development, useful developing novel
diagnostic biomarkers aiding prevention control oipn.
