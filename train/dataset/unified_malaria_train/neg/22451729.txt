in iran, plasmodium vivax responsible 80% infected cases 
of malaria per year. control interventions vivax malaria humans rely
mainly developed diagnostic methods. recombinant p. vivax apical membrane
antigen-1 (rpvama-1) reported achieve designing rapid, sensitive, and
specific molecular diagnosis. study aimed perform isolation and
expression rpvama-1, derived iranian patients residing endemic
area. then, diagnostic efficiency characterized iranian pvama-1 was
assessed using indirect elisa method. purpose, partial region of
ama-1 gene amplified, cloned, expressed pet32a plasmid. the
recombinant his-tagged protein purified used coat elisa plate.
antibody detection assessed indirect elisa using rpvama-1. validity of
the elisa method detection anti-p. vivax antibodies field was
compared light microscopy 84 confirmed p. vivax patients compared 84
non-p. vivax infected individuals. elisa cut-off value calculated 
mean+2sd od values people living malaria endemic areas south 
part iran. found cut-off point od=0.311 showed best
correlation sera confirmed p. vivax infection healthy
control sera. sensitivity 81.0% specificity 84.5% found 
cut titer. good degree statistical agreement found elisa
using rpvama-1 light microscopy (0.827) kappa analysis.
