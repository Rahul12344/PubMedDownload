objective: assess n51i, c59r s108n polymorphisms dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) a437g k540e dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes 
p. falciparum isolates recovered pregnant women asymptomatic malaria in
a coastal setting nigeria.
subjects methods: total 107 consenting consecutively enrolled
pregnant women (mean age ± standard deviation, 26.6 ± 4.5 years) attending
antenatal care iru/victoria island primary health centre, lagos, were
screened peripheral malaria microscopy, histidine-rich
protein-2-based rapid diagnostic test (rdt) polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) using finger-pricked dot blood samples. dna extracted the
blood used dhfr dhps gene polymorphism analyses pcr and
restriction fragment length polymorphism. sociodemographic parasite data 
obtained analysed.
results: 107 patients, 34 (31.8%), 46 (43%) 40 (37.4%) found to
be p. falciparum infected using microscopy, rdt corrected rdt-pcr,
respectively (p < 0.05). prevalence p. falciparum isolates mutant and
mixed genotypes dhfr codons 51, 59 108 70, 75 80%,
respectively, triple mutation homozygous form 35%. the
prevalence homozygous quintuple dhfr plus dhps mutant 5%, that
of p. falciparum isolates mutant mixed genotypes dhps codons
437 540 37.5 22.5%, respectively.
conclusion: study revealed emergence k540e mutation among the
parasite population lagos. however, supports implementation the
intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine continuous effectiveness monitoring study 
area.
