the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) highly variable family genes
involved parasite recognition initiation adaptive immune system
responses. variation mhc loci maintained primarily through
parasite-mediated selection disassortative mate choice. characterize mhc
diversity rufous-collared sparrows (zonotrichia capensis), abundant south
american passerine, examined allelic nucleotide variation mhc class i
exon 3 using pyrosequencing. exon 3 comprises substantial portion the
peptide-binding region (pbr) class mhc thus plays important role in
intracellular pathogen defense. identified 98 putatively functional alleles
that produce 56 unique protein sequences across least 6 paralogous loci.
allelic diversity per individual exon-wide nucleotide diversity were
relatively low; however, found specific amino acid positions high
nucleotide diversity signatures positive selection (elevated n /d )
that may correspond pbr. based variation physicochemical
properties amino acids "positively selected sites," identified ten
functional mhc supertypes. spatial variation nucleotide diversity the
number mhc alleles, proteins, supertypes per individual suggests that
environmental heterogeneity may affect patterns mhc diversity. furthermore,
populations high mhc diversity higher prevalence avian malaria,
consistent parasite-mediated selection mhc. together, results
provide framework subsequent investigations selective agents acting on
mhc z. capensis.
