malaria african trypanosomiasis tropical diseases caused protozoa 
plasmodium trypanosoma, respectively. parasites undergo complex life
cycles mammalian host insect vector, exposed 
oxidative nitrosative challenges induced host immune system and
endogenous processes. attacking parasite's redox metabolism target
mechanism several known antiparasitic drugs promising approach novel 
drug development. apart aspect, oxidation cysteine residues plays 
key role protein-protein interaction, metabolic responses redox events, and
signaling. understanding role dynamics reactive oxygen species and
thiol switches regulating cellular redox homeostasis crucial basic
and applied biomedical approaches. numerous techniques therefore been
established detect redox changes parasites including biochemical methods,
fluorescent dyes, genetically encoded probes. review, aim give 
an insight characteristics redox networks pathogens plasmodium
and trypanosoma, including comprehensive overview consequences of
specific deletions redox-associated genes. furthermore, summarize
mechanisms detection methods thiol switches parasites discuss 
their specificity sensitivity.
