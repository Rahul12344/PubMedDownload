background & objectives: antimalarial resistance p. falciparum malaria
parasite creates serious obstacle malaria control programme. keeping in
mind, present study antifolate resistance associated point mutations p.
falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) dihydropteroate synthetase
(pfdhps) genes among field samples arunachal pradesh determined.
methods: blood samples collected 145 suspected malaria patients/healthy
control subjects malarious areas lohit changlang districts arunachal
pradesh, india january 2012 december 2013.
results: microscopic slide examination, 51.03% (74/145) found malaria
positive. plasmodium falciparum mono-infection observed 62.16% (46/74) 
total malaria positive cases. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) employed all
the p. falciparum positive samples detection 648 bp pfdhfr 710 bp
of pfdhps genes. amplified products analysed detection single
nucleotide polymorphisms dhfr dhps genes. total four different
genotypes pfdhfr gene observed, double mutant allele anrni was
mostly prevalent found 65.22% (30/46) cases. likewise, four
different haplotypes pfdhps gene detected, triple mutant allele 
ageaa shares 69.57% (32/46) followed haplotypes. pfdhfr-pfdhps two
locus mutations analysis, two isolates changlang district shown quintuple 
mutant haplotype airnl-ageaa, likely associated treatment failure. the
p. falciparum two locus dhfr-dhps haplotype (anrni-ageaa) observed 56.52% 
(26/46) cases.
interpretation & conclusion: overall, high grade sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance associated genetic polymorphisms observed among p. falciparum
parasite population arunachal pradesh study period.
