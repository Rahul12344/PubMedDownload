background: ability successfully identify incriminate pathogen vectors
is fundamental effective pathogen control management. task is
confounded existence cryptic species complexes. molecular markers can
offer highly effective means species identification complexes and
are routinely employed study medical entomology. evaluate a
multi-locus system identification potential malaria vectors the
anopheles strodei subgroup.
methods: larvae, pupae adult mosquitoes (n = 61) an. strodei
subgroup collected 21 localities nine brazilian states sequenced
for coi, its2 white gene. bayesian phylogenetic approach used to
describe relationships strodei subgroup utility coi and
its2 barcodes assessed using neighbor joining tree "best close match"
approaches.
results: bayesian phylogenetic analysis coi, its2 white gene found
support seven clades an. strodei subgroup. coi its2 barcodes
were individually unsuccessful resolving identifying species the
subgroup. coi barcode failed resolve an. albertoi an. strodei but
successfully identified approximately 92% species queries, its2 
barcode failed resolve an. arthuri successfully identified approximately
60% species queries. multi-locus coi-its2 barcode, however, resolved all
species neighbor joining tree successfully identified species
queries using "best close match" approach.
conclusions: study corroborates existence an. albertoi, an. cp form
and an. strodei an. strodei subgroup identifies four species an.
arthuri informally named a-d herein. use multi-locus barcode proposed
for species identification, potentially important utility vector
incrimination. individuals previously found naturally infected plasmodium
vivax southern amazon basin reported an. strodei likely have
been an. arthuri c identified study.
