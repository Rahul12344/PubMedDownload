osteoporosis osteolytic disease features enhanced osteoclast formation
and bone resorption. identification agents inhibit osteoclast
formation function important treatment osteoporosis.
dihydroartemisinin natural compound used treat malaria role in
osteoporosis known. here, found dihydroartemisinin suppress
rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis bone resorption dose-dependent manner. 
dihydroartemisinin inhibited expression osteoclast marker genes as
cathepsin k, calcitonin receptor, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(tracp). furthermore, dihydroartemisinin inhibited rankl-induced nf-κb nfat
activity. addition, using vivo ovariectomized mouse model, show 
dihydroartemisinin able reverse bone loss caused ovariectomy.
together, study shows dihydroartemisinin attenuates bone loss in
ovariectomized mice inhibiting rankl-induced osteoclast formation and
function. indicates dihydroartemisinin, first physiology or
medicine nobel prize discovery china, potential treatment option
