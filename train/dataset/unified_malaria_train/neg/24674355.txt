objective: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) widely used intermittent
preventive treatment (ipt) malaria pregnant women sub-saharan africa.
there reports wide-spread sp resistance countries sp once
been used first-line treatment. unclear whether development sp 
resistance also affects countries sp mainly used context ipt, 
as case burkina faso. assess efficacy sp-based ipt, we
monitored prevalence sp conferring genetic mutations genes dhfr and
dhps plasmodium falciparum populations rural area burkina faso 
period 13 years.
methods: molecular epidemiological study consisted six consecutive
cross-sectional surveys rainy dry seasons (2009-2012). data rainy
season 2000 served baseline. mutations dhfr dhps associated with
sp resistance analysed pyrosequencing 861 parasite-positive samples.
results: prevalence sp resistance conferring triple dhfr mutation 51i,
59r, 108n increased 1.3% rainy season 2000 35.3% 2009, and
54.3% 2011 (p ≤ 0.001). comparing rainy dry seasons, observed an
increasing step-like pattern higher prevalence dhfr triple mutant 
the respective dry season compared preceding rainy season. the
proportion dhps 437gly mutation rainy season 2000 53.2% 
subsequently increased 77.6% 2009 (p ≤ 0.001).
conclusion: increase molecular markers linked sp resistance
jeopardises efficacy iptp planned ipti interventions burkina
faso, calling careful monitoring genotypic resistance markers vivo 
validation ipt efficacy.
