visceral leishmaniasis (vl) caused leishmania spp. important
vector-borne largely zoonotic disease. china, three epidemiological types 
of vl described: anthroponotic vl (avl), mountain-type zoonotic vl
(mt-zvl), desert-type zvl (dt-zvl). transmitted four different
sand fly species: phlebotomus chinensis, p. longiductus, p. wui, p.
alexandri. 1951, detailed survey vl showed rampant the
vast rural areas west, northwest, north yangtze river. control
programs designed implemented stringently government all
administrative levels, resulting elimination disease areas of
endemicity, except western northwestern regions. control programs
consisted (i) diagnosis chemotherapy patients, (ii) identification,
isolation, disposal infected dogs, (iii) residual insecticide indoor
spraying vector control. success control programs attributable 
to massive effective mobilization general public health workers to
the cause. nationally, annual incidence low, i.e., only
0.03/100,000 according available 2011 official record. overwhelming
majority cases reported sites endemicity western and
northwestern regions. here, describe depth breadth current
status epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention disease, with
particular reference control programs. pertinent information been
assembled scattered literature past decades different languages
that readily accessible scientific community. information
provided constitutes integral part knowledge leishmaniasis the
global context special value interested control
programs.
