background: blood meal host selection mosquito vectors important
component understanding disease dynamics pathogens threaten endemic
fauna isolated islands galápagos. research feeding behavior 
mosquitoes provide clues hosts vectors involved disease
transmission. information particularly critical endemic wildlife
fauna island systems evolved without resistance novel diseases
such avian malaria. aims study determine blood-feeding
patterns two species mosquitoes found galápagos discuss their
feeding behavior may influence transmission pathogens avian
malaria.
methods: summer 2015, sampled two mosquito species (aedes
taeniorhynchus culex quinquefasciatus) across 18 different sites isla
santa cruz, second largest island galápagos largest
human population. trapped mosquitoes using cdc light traps cdc gravid
traps identified sources blood meals engorged mosquitoes sequencing
a portion vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.
results: 947 female mosquitoes captured, 320 blood-fed, pcr
amplifications successful 301 blood meals. results revealed 
both aedes taeniorhynchus culex quinquefasciatus feed variety of
vertebrate taxa, numerically dominated humans isla santa cruz.
conclusions: high proportion mammalian blood meals could represent locally
available abundant hosts santa cruz. however, host surveys estimates
of relative abundances vertebrate species need accompany mosquito
trapping studies non-inhabited inhabited islands galápagos further
validate this.
