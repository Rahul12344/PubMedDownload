background: schistosomiasis one important parasitic diseases
worldwide, second malaria. schistosomes exhibit exceptional
reproductive biology since sexual maturation female, includes
the differentiation reproductive organs, controlled pairing.
pathogenicity originates eggs, cause severe inflammation their
hosts. elucidation processes contributing female maturation 
interest basic science also considering novel concepts combating
schistosomiasis.
methodology/principal findings: get direct access reproductive organs, 
we established novel protocol using combined detergent/protease-treatment
removing tegument musculature adult schistosoma mansoni. steps
were monitored scanning electron microscopy (sem) bright-field microscopy 
(bf). focused gonads adult schistosomes demonstrated that
isolated purified testes ovaries used morphological and
structural studies well sources rna protein sufficient amounts
for subsequent analyses rt-pcr immunoblotting. end, first
exemplary evidence obtained tissue-specific transcription within the
gonads (axonemal dynein intermediate chain gene smaxdynic; aquaporin gene smaqp) 
as well post-transcriptional regulation (smaqp).
conclusions/significance: presented method provides new way getting
access tissue-specific material s. mansoni. regard many still
unanswered questions schistosome biology, elucidating molecular
processes involved schistosome reproduction, protocol provides
opportunities for, e.g., sub-transcriptomics sub-proteomics organ
level. promote characterisation gene-expression profiles, or
more specifically complete knowledge signalling pathways contributing to
differentiation processes, discovering involved molecules may represent
potential targets novel intervention strategies. furthermore, gonads and
other tissues basis cell isolation, opening new perspectives for
establishing cell lines, one tools desperately needed post-genomic 
era.
