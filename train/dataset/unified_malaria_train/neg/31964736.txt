the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum uses mutually exclusive
expression pfemp1-encoding var gene family evade host immune
system. despite progress molecular understanding default silencing 
mechanism, activation mechanism uniquely expressed var member remains 
elusive. gc-rich noncoding rna (ncrna) gene family coevolved with
plasmodium species express var genes. here, show ncrna family
is transcribed clonally variant manner, predominant transcription 
single member occurring ncrna located adjacent upstream 
active var gene. developed specific crispr interference (crispri) strategy
that allowed transcriptional repression gc-rich members. lack of
gc-rich ncrna transcription led downregulation entire var gene
family ring-stage parasites. strikingly, mature blood-stage parasites, 
gc-rich ncrna crispri affected transcription patterns clonally
variant gene families, including downregulation pfmc-2tm members. we
provide evidence key role gc-rich ncrna transcription var gene

various clonally variant multigene families involved parasite virulence.

is deadliest malaria parasite species, accounting vast majority of
disease cases deaths. virulence parasite reliant upon the
mutually exclusive expression cytoadherence proteins encoded 60-member 
var gene family. antigenic variation multigene family serves immune
evasion mechanism, ultimately leading chronic infection pathogenesis.
