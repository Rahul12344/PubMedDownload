the de novo pyrimidine-biosynthesis pathway plasmodium falciparum a
promising target antimalarial drug discovery. parasite requires supply 
of purines pyrimidines growth proliferation unable take 
pyrimidines host. direct (or indirect) inhibition de novo pyrimidine 
biosynthesis via dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (pfdhodh), fourth enzyme the
pathway, already shown lethal parasite. second step 
of plasmodial pyrimidine-synthesis pathway, aspartate carbamoyl phosphate
are condensed n-carbamoyl-l-aspartate inorganic phosphate aspartate
transcarbamoylase (pfatc). paper, 2.5 å resolution crystal structure 
of pfatc reported. space group pfatc crystals determined 
monoclinic p21, unit-cell parameters = 87.0, b = 103.8, c = 87.1 å, α =
90.0, β = 117.7, γ = 90.0°. presented pfatc model shares high degree of
homology catalytic domain escherichia coli atc. yet no
evidence existence regulatory domain pfatc. similarly e. coli
atc, pfatc modelled homotrimer three active sites
is formed oligomeric interface. active site comprises residues from
two adjacent subunits trimer high degree evolutional
conservation. here, activity loss owing mutagenesis key active-site
residues also described.
