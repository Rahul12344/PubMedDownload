the successful development effective vaccines elusive many the
world's important infectious diseases. additionally, much population,
such aged immunocompromised, unable mount effective
immunologic response existing vaccines. vectored immunoprophylaxis (vip) a
novel approach designed address challenges. rather utilizing an
antigen trigger response host's immune system normally done
with traditional vaccines, vip genetically engineers production tailored
antibodies non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing humoral immune system.
direct administration genes encoding neutralizing antibodies proven to
be effective preventing treating several infectious diseases in
animal models. while, significant amount work focused hiv, including 
an ongoing clinical trial, approach also shown effective for
malaria, dengue, hepatitis c, influenza, more. addition presenting
itself potentially efficient approach solving long-standing vaccine
challenges, approach may best, only, method vaccinate
immunocompromised individuals. many issues still need addressed, including 
which tissue(s) makes suitable platform, vector(s) most
efficient transducing platform tissue used secrete antibodies, 
what long-term effects treatment. provide brief
overview approach, potential application treating 
world's intractable infectious diseases.
