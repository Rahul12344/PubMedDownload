droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddpcr) partial pcr based on
water-oil emulsion droplet technology. highly sensitive method for
detecting delineating minor alleles complex backgrounds provides
absolute quantification dna targets. ddpcr technology applied for
detection many pathogens. sensitive assay utilizing ddpcr for
detection quantification plasmodium species investigated. assay
was developed two levels detection, genus specific plasmodium
species specific plasmodium species detection. ddpcr assay was
developed based primers probes specific plasmodium genus 18s rrna
gene. using ddpcr ultra-sensitive p. falciparum assessment, lower level
of detection concentrated dna obtained high volume (1 ml) blood
sample 11 parasites/ml. species identification, particular samples
with mixed infections, duplex reaction developed detection and
quantification p. falciparum/ p. vivax p. malariae/ p. ovale. amplification
of plasmodium species duplex reaction showed equal sensitivity to
singleplex single species detection. duplex ddpcr assay higher
sensitivity identify minor species 32 subpatent parasitaemia samples from
cambodia, performed better real-time pcr. ddpcr assay shows high
sensitivity assess low parasitaemia human plasmodium species. this
provides useful research tool studying role asymptomatic
parasite reservoir transmission regions aiming malaria elimination.
