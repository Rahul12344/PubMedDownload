background: radiation-induced brain injury nonnegligible issue the
management cancer patients treated partial whole brain irradiation. in
particular, temporal lobe injury (tli), deleterious late complication in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, greatly affects long-term life quality these
patients. although genome-wide association studies (gwass) successfully
identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated radiation
toxicity, genetic variants contributing radiation-induced brain injury
have yet assessed.
methods: recruited performed follow-up prospective observational
cohort, genetic architecture radiotherapy toxicity prognosis, using
magnetic resonance imaging tli diagnosis. conducted genome-wide
association analysis 1082 patients validated top associations two
independent cohorts 1119 741 patients, respectively. statistical tests
were two-sided.
results: identified promoter variant rs17111237 (a > g, minor allele
frequency [maf] = 0.14) cep128 associated tli risk (hazard ratio = 1.45, 
95% confidence interval = 1.26 1.66, pcombined=3.18 × 10-7) in
moderate linkage disequilibrium (ld) rs162171 (maf = 0.18, r2 = 0.69), the
top signal cep128 (hazard ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-1.66,
pcombined= 6.17 × 10-9). combining clinical variables top snp, we
divided patients different subgroups varying risk 5-year
tli-free rates ranging 33.7% 95.5%. cep128, key component mother
centriole, tightly interacts multiple radiation-resistant genes plays an
important role maintaining functional cilia, otherwise lead 
a malfunction neural network. found a > g alteration rs17111237
impaired promoter activity cep128 knockdown cep128 decreased the
clonogenic cell survival u87 cells radiation. noteworthy, 12.7% (27/212)
of gwas-based associated genes (p < .001) enriched neurogenesis
pathway.
conclusions: three-stage study first gwas radiation-induced brain 
injury implicates genetic susceptibility gene cep128 involved tli
development provides novel insight underlying mechanisms of
radiation-induced brain injury.
