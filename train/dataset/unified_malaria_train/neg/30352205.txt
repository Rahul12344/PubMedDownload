peroxidases catalyze reduction peroxides that, turn, oxidize
various substrates. widely reported play important role in
mosquito innate immunity various pathogens. here, characterized
double heme peroxidase (asdblox) gene indian malaria vector anopheles
stephensi. true ortholog an. gambiae dblox. 4209 bp asdblox gene 
encodes protein 1402 amino acids two duplicated peroxidase
domains, domain (from amino acid 61 527) domain ii (from amino acid 714 
to 1252). first domain substrate binding sites lacks other
motifs functional heme peroxidase (e.g. heme binding site, calcium binding
site homodimer interface). instead, two integrin binding motifs-ldv
(leu-asp-val) rgd (arg-gly-asp). second peroxidase domain, however, has
all features complete heme peroxidase along integrin binding
motif ldi (leu-asp-ile). thus, asdblox gene unique type peroxinectin as
these groups proteins characterized integrin binding motifs along 
a heme peroxidase domain. also observed asdblox gene expressed 
all life cycle stages mosquito highly induced pupal stage of
development indicates possible role development.
