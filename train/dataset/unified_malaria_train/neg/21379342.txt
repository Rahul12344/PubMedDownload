plasmodium falciparum employs antigenic variation evade human immune
response switching expression different variant surface antigens
encoded var gene family. epigenetic mechanisms including histone
modifications sub-nuclear compartmentalization contribute transcriptional 
regulation malaria parasite, particular control antigenic variation.
another mechanism epigenetic control exchange canonical histones
with alternative variants generate functionally specialized chromatin domains.
here demonstrate alternative histone pfh2a.z associated the
epigenetic regulation var genes. many eukaryotic organisms histone
variant h2a.z mediates open chromatin structure promoters facilitates
diverse levels regulation, including transcriptional activation. throughout
the asexual, intraerythrocytic lifecycle p. falciparum found p.
falciparum ortholog h2a.z (pfh2a.z) colocalizes histone modifications
that characteristic transcriptionally-permissive euchromatin, with
markers heterochromatin. consistent finding, antibodies pfh2a.z
co-precipitate permissive modification h3k4me3. by
chromatin-immunoprecipitation show pfh2a.z enriched nucleosomes
around transcription start site (tss) transcriptionally active and
silent stage-specific genes. var genes, however, pfh2a.z enriched the
tss active transcription ring stage parasites. thus, contrast
to genes, temporal var gene regulation involves histone variant exchange at
promoter nucleosomes. sir2 histone deacetylases important var gene
silencing yeast ortholog antagonises h2a.z function subtelomeric
yeast genes. immature p. falciparum parasites lacking sir2a sir2b high var 
transcription levels correlate enrichment pfh2a.z tss. sir2a
knock parasites mature var genes silenced, pfh2a.z remains
enriched tss var genes; contrast, pfh2a.z lost tss of
de-repressed var genes mature sir2b knock parasites. result indicates
that pfh2a.z occupancy active var promoter antagonized pfsir2a
during intraerythrocytic life cycle. conclude pfh2a.z contributes 
the nucleosome architecture promoters regulated dynamically active
var genes.
