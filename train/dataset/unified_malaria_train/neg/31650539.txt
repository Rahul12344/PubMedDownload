fikk kinases human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum attractive
targets new anti-malaria drugs, orthologues humans and
have linked disease severity. six fikks known exported red
blood cells (rbcs) mediate dramatic structural functional changes 
to rbcs central pathogenesis. eleven members family, which
are predicted exported infected rbcs (irbcs), remain uncharacterised. 
using targeted gene-knockout approach, characterised fikks and
discovered five essential parasite survival. three five
fikks (fikk9.1, fikk10.1, fikk10.2) exported parasite irbcs
and two (fikk9.1 fikk10.1), export via maurer's clefts
(parasite-derived structures involved protein trafficking pathognomonic of
falciparum malaria). remaining two essential kinases, fikk3 associated
with rhoptries (specialised protein secretory organelles parasite) and
fikk9.5 localised parasite nucleus. diverse localisation and
essentiality fikks demonstrate play different essential
roles survival p. falciparum rbcs therefore attractive new
drug targets prevention treatment falciparum malaria.
