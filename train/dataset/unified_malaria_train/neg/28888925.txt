cd4+ follicular helper (tfh) cells shown critical the
activation germinal center (gc) b-cell responses. similar infections,
plasmodium infection activates gc well non-gc b cell responses. here, 
we sought explore whether tfh cells gc b cells required eliminate a
plasmodium infection. cd4 cell-targeted deletion gene encodes
bcl6, master transcription factor tfh program, resulted complete
disruption tfh response plasmodium chabaudi c57bl/6 mice and
consequent disruption gc responses igg responses inability to
eliminate otherwise self-resolving chronic p. chabaudi infection. the
other hand, contrary previous observations immunization viral
infection models, signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (slam)-associated
protein (sap)-deficient mice able activate tfh cells, gc b cells, igg
responses parasite. study demonstrates critical role tfh
cells controlling systemic infection, highlights differences the
signals required activate gc b cell responses complex parasite
compared protein immunizations viral infections. therefore,
these data highly pertinent designing malaria vaccines able activate
broadly protective b-cell responses.
