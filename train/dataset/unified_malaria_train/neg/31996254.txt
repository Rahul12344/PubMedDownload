background: according scientific recommendations, paratransgenesis one of
the solutions improving effectiveness global malaria eradication
programme. paratransgenesis, symbiont microorganisms used distorting
or blocking parasite life-cycle, affecting fitness longevity of
vectors reducing vectorial competence. revealed recently 
bacteria could used potent tools double stranded rna production and
delivery insects. moreover, findings showed rnase iii mutant bacteria are
more competent aim. asaia spp. introduced potent
paratransgenesis candidates combating malaria and, based specific
features goal, could considered effective dsrna production and
delivery tools anopheles spp. therefore, decided characterize rnc
gene related protein provide basic required information for
creating rnase iii mutant asaia bacterium.
methods: asaia bacteria isolated field-collected anopheles stephensi
mosquitoes. rnc gene surrounding sequences characterized by
rapid amplification genomic ends. rnase iii recombinant protein expressed 
in e. coli bl21 biological activity purified recombinant protein was
assayed. furthermore, asaia rnaseiii amino acid sequence analyzed in
silico approaches homology modeling docking determine its
structural properties.
results: study, structure rnc gene related operon from
asaia sp. determined. addition, performing superimposition docking 
with specific substrate, structural features asaia rnaseiii protein such
as critical residues involved essential proper folding of
active site, binding magnesium ions double stranded rna molecule to
protein cleaving dsrna molecules, determined.
conclusions: study, basic essential data creating rnase
iii mutant asaia sp. strain, first step developing efficient
rnai-based paratransgenesis tool, acquired. asaia sp. found in
different medically-important vectors data potentially helpful
for researchers studying paratransgenesis vector-borne diseases are
interested applying rnai technology field.
