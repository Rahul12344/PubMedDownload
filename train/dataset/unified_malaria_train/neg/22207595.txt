objectives: study origin spread chloroquine-resistant
plasmodium falciparum population indian subcontinent.
methods: fourteen microsatellites spanning ∼120 kb region, flanking p.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene, analysed 185 
parasite isolates.
results: indian p. falciparum population exhibited selective valley of
reduced genetic variation flanking microsatellites mutant pfcrt
alleles (up ±29 kb) compared wild-type allele. valley much
narrower ±200 kb valley reported african south-east asian
countries. majority isolates showed asymmetry selective valley,
where upstream microsatellites showed less genetic variation downstream 
microsatellites. regional variation width symmetry selective
valley noticed, seems related number pfcrt alleles
present parasite population region. forty-six different
microsatellite haplotypes observed among p. falciparum isolates
containing mutant pfcrt alleles. parasite populations different regions of
mainland india shared microsatellite haplotypes them, shared
none isolates andaman nicobar islands, vice versa.
indian isolates shared microsatellite haplotypes isolates papua new
guinea thailand.
conclusions: regard chloroquine regional variation the
selection pressure p. falciparum population india. findings 
help regional implementation drug policy india's malaria control
programme.
