many variant proteins encoded plasmodium-specific multigene families are
exported red blood cells (rbc). p. falciparum-specific variant proteins
encoded var, stevor rifin multigene families exported onto the
surface infected red blood cells (irbc) mediate interactions irbc 
and host cells resulting tissue sequestration rosetting. however, the
precise function plasmodium multigene families encoding exported
proteins unknown. understand role rbc-exported proteins rodent
malaria parasites (rmp) analysed expression cellular location by
fluorescent-tagging members pir, fam-a fam-b multigene families.
furthermore, performed phylogenetic analyses fam-a fam-b multigene 
families, indicate families history functional
differentiation unique rmp. demonstrate three families that
expression family members irbc mutually exclusive. tagged
proteins transported irbc cytoplasm onto irbc plasma
membrane, indicating unlikely play direct role irbc-host
cell interactions. unexpectedly, family members also expressed during
the liver stage, transported parasitophorous vacuole.
this suggests protein families promote parasite development both
the liver blood, either supporting parasite development within hepatocytes
and erythrocytes and/or manipulating host immune response. indeed, 
case fam-a, steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer
(start) domain, found several family members transfer
phosphatidylcholine vitro. observations indicate proteins may
transport (host) phosphatidylcholine membrane synthesis. first
demonstration biological function exported variant protein family 
rodent malaria parasites.
