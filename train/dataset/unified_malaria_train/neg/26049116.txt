malaria, mosquito-borne infectious disease, caused plasmodium genus, 
and remains one greatest health challenges worldwide. malarial
parasite possess biosynthetic pathway b-group vitamin incorporating the
thiamine metabolizing enzymes; humans hand cannot synthesize the
vitamin require within diet. vitamin b1 biosynthetic enzyme
5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthioazolekinase [ec. 2.7.1.50] plasmodium
(pfthzk) particularly attractive biomedical target since inhibition
of enzyme may lead effective treatment malaria. present
study, pfthzk recombinantly produced 6× fusion protein in
escherichia coli bl21(de3) purified using nickel affinity size exclusion 
chromatography. enzyme monomeric molecular mass 34 kda, a
specific activity 295.04 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) showed optimum temperature
and ph 37 °c 7.5, respectively. purified pfthzk non-competitively 
inhibited (79%) silver nanoparticles (2-6 nm); ki=6.45 μm. mechanism is
suggested interaction silver nanoparticle pfthzk two 
sulphur bearing amino acids (met(1), cys(206)) surface subunit 
the enzyme.
