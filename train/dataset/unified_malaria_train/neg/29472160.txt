the intra-erythrocytic apicomplexan babesia microti predominant pathogen
that causes human babesiosis, infectious disease occurs worldwide. b.
microti relies antioxidant including thioredoxin system maintain the
redox balance erythrocytic stage. present study, the
full-length b. microti thioredoxin 3 (bmtrx3) gene cloned, expressed in
vitro, response antiprotozoal drugs tested. full-length
bmtrx3 663 bp contained intact open reading frame 567 bp. the
encoded polypeptide 188 amino acids predicted molecular weight the
protein 21.7 kda. conserved thioredoxin-like family domain found in
bmtrx3. expression bmtrx3 upregulated third eighth day
post-infection mice, whereas expression downregulated beginning
and later stages. western blot analysis showed mouse anti-bmtrx3 serum could
recognize native bmtrx3 parasite lysates mouse anti-b.
microti serum could recognize recombinant bmtrx3 protein. immunofluorescence 
microscopy showed bmtrx3 localized cell cytoplasm b. microti
merozoites b. microti-infected red blood cells. results bovine insulin 
reduction assay indicated enzyme activity purified recombinant bmtrx3 
protein. anti-malaria drug chloroquine significantly inhibited expression
of bmtrx3, however, another anti-malaria drug qunine, known anti-babesiosis
drug clindamycin, induced significantly higher upregulation bmtrx3 mrna. the
results present study demonstrate bmtrx3 functional enzyme 
antioxidant activity may involved response b. microti to
anti-parasite drugs.
