background: plasmodium vivax transmission thailand substantially
reduced past 10 years, yet remains highly endemic along international
borders. understanding genetic relationship residual parasite populations 
can help track origins parasites reintroduced into
malaria-free regions within country.
methodology/results: total 127 p. vivax isolates genotyped two
western provinces (tak kanchanaburi) one eastern province (ubon
ratchathani) thailand using 10 microsatellite markers. genetic diversity was
high, recent clonal expansion detected three provinces.
substantial population structure genetic differentiation parasites among
provinces suggest limited gene flow among sites. haplotype
sharing among three sites, reduced panel four microsatellite markers
was sufficient assign parasites provincial origins.
conclusion/significance: significant parasite genetic differentiation between
provinces shows successful interruption parasite spread within thailand, but
high diversity along international borders implies substantial parasite
population size regions. provincial origin p. vivax cases 
reliably determined genotyping four microsatellite markers, be
useful monitoring parasite reintroduction malaria elimination.
