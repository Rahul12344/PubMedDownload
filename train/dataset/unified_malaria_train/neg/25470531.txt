drug resistance genomics antimalarial drug artemisinin.

winzeler ea, manary mj.

across globe, 200 million annual malaria infections result to
660,000 deaths, 77% occur children age five years.
although prevention important, malaria deaths typically prevented using
antimalarial drugs eliminate symptoms clear parasites blood.
artemisinins one remaining compound classes used to
cure multidrug-resistant plasmodium falciparum infections. unfortunately,
clinical trials southeast asia showing artemisinin-based treatments
are beginning lose effectiveness, adding renewed urgency search
for genetic determinants parasite resistance important drug class.
we review genetic genomic approaches led improved
understanding artemisinin resistance, including identification of
resistance-conferring mutations p. falciparum kelch13 gene.
