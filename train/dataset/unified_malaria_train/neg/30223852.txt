background: malaria equatorial guinea remains major public health problem.
the country holo-endemic area year-round transmission pattern. in
2016, prevalence malaria 12.09% malaria caused 15% deaths among
children 5 years. continental region, 95.2% malaria infections
were plasmodium falciparum, 9.5% plasmodium vivax, eight cases mixed
infection 2011. main strategy malaria control quick accurate
diagnosis followed effective treatment. early accurate diagnosis of
malaria essential effective disease management malaria
surveillance. quality malaria diagnosis important settings, as
misdiagnosis result significant morbidity mortality. microscopy and
rdts primary choices diagnosing malaria field. however,
false-negative results may delay treatment increase number persons
capable infecting mosquitoes community. present study analysed 
performance microscopy rdts, two main techniques used equatorial
guinea diagnosis malaria, compared semi-nested multiplex pcr
(snm-pcr).
results: total 1724 samples tested microscopy, rdt, snm-pcr were
analysed. among negative samples detected microscopy, 335 (19.4%) were
false negatives. hand, negative samples detected rdt, 128
(13.3%) false negatives based pcr. finding important, especially 
since group patients receive antimalarial treatment.
conclusions: owing high number false negatives microscopy, is
necessary reinforce training microscopy, "gold standard" endemic
areas. network reference centres could potentially support ongoing
diagnostic control efforts made malaria control programmes long
term, national centre tropical medicine currently supports national
programme malaria equatorial guinea perform molecular
studies necessary disease control. taking account results obtained
with rdts, exhaustive study deletion hrp2 gene must done 
in eg help choose correct rdt area.
