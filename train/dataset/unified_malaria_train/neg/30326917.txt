background: anopheles stephensi considered important malaria vector in
iran, asia, recently horn africa. recently, ansteobp1 intron i
sequence introduced new molecular marker identification its
biological forms including, mysorensis, intermediate type, using insectary
colony specimens.
methods: current study, new marker ability molecular identification 
biological forms evaluated an. stephensi specimens collected from
iran afghanistan malarious provinces. following dna extraction pcr
amplification, sequence analysis constructed phylogenetic tree revealed 
type intermediate forms distributed iran.
results: specimens collected afghanistan identified intermediate 
mysorensis forms. therefore, intermediate form sympatric species both
countries. based results ansteobp1 intron sequences, an. stephensi
could suggested new anopheles complex species including an. stephensi
sibling (type form), an. stephensi sibling b (intermediate form) an.
stephensi sibling c (mysorensis form). first report presence
of an. stephensi biological forms afghanistan.
conclusions: iran going eliminate malaria transmission country,
precise species identification, especially complex species helpful 
the prevention malaria resurgence country, mainly common
fauna anopheles species border malaria population movement
within afghanistan, pakistan, iran.
