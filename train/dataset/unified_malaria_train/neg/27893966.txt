plastid-made biopharmaceuticals treat major metabolic genetic disorders,
including alzheimer's, diabetes, hypertension, hemophilia, retinopathy.
booster vaccines made chloroplasts prevent global infectious diseases, as
tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, polio, biological threats, as
anthrax plague. recent advances field include commercial-scale
production human therapeutic proteins fda-approved cgmp facilities,
development tags deliver protein drugs targeted human cells tissues, 
methods deliver precise doses, long-term stability protein drugs at
ambient temperature, maintaining efficacy. codon optimization utilizing
valuable information sequenced chloroplast genomes enhanced expression of
eukaryotic human viral genes chloroplasts offered unique insights 
translation chloroplasts. support major biopharmaceutical companies,
development hydroponic production systems, evaluation regulatory
agencies, including cdc, fda, usda, augur well advancing novel
concept clinic revolutionizing affordable healthcare.
