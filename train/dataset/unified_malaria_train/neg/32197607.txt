background: loss chloroquine (cq) effectiveness led withdrawal 
from national policies first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria in
several endemic countries, democratic republic congo (drc). the
k76t mutation pfcrt gene identified marker cq resistance 
and svmnt haplotype codons 72-76 gene associated with
resistance amodiaquine (aq). drc, prevalence k76t decreased 
from 100% 2000 63.9% 2014. purpose study determine
the prevalence k76t mutations circulating strains plasmodium falciparum,
16 years cq withdrawal drc investigate presence the
svmnt haplotype.
methods: 2017, ten geographical sites across drc selected. dried
blood samples collected patients attending health centres. malaria 
first detected rapid diagnostic test (rdt) available site (sd bioline
malaria ag pf carestart malaria pf) thick blood smear confirmed by
a p. falciparum species-specific real-time pcr assay. pfcrt gene segment
containing fragment encodes amino acids positions 72-76 amplified
by conventional pcr sequencing.
results: total 1070 patients enrolled. 806 pcr-confirmed
p. falciparum positive samples, 764 successfully sequenced. k76t
mutation detected 218 samples (28.5%; 95% ci 25.4%-31.9%), mainly (96%)
with cviet haplotype. prevalence cq resistance marker unequally
distributed across country, ranging 1.5% fungurume 89.5% in
katana. svmnt haplotype, related aq resistance, detected.
conclusion: overall, frequency p. falciparum cq resistance marker 
decreased significantly resistance marker aq detected drc in
2017. however, regions variability cq resistance remains high in
the country. studies needed continuous monitoring cq
resistance level prospective re-use malaria management. absence of
the aq resistance marker line use drug current drc 
malaria treatment policy.
