cerebral malaria (cm) serious neurological complication caused plasmodium
falciparum infection. currently, treatment cm provision of
antimalarial drugs; however, treatment often fails prevent
death development neurological sequelae. identify potential improved
treatments cm, performed nonbiased whole-brain transcriptomic
time-course analysis antimalarial drug chemotherapy murine experimental cm 
(ecm). bioinformatics analyses revealed il33 critical regulator of
neuroinflammation cerebral pathology down-regulated brain
during fatal ecm acute period following treatment ecm. consistent
with this, administration il33 alongside antimalarial drugs significantly
improved treatment success established ecm. mechanistically, il33
treatment reduced inflammasome activation il1β production microglia and
intracerebral monocytes acute recovery period following treatment ecm. 
moreover, treatment nlrp3-inflammasome inhibitor mcc950 alongside
antimalarial drugs phenocopied protective effect il33 therapy improving
the recovery established ecm. showed il1β release from
macrophages stimulated hemozoin antimalarial drugs was
inhibited mcc950. results therefore demonstrate manipulation the
il33-nlrp3 axis may effective therapy suppress neuroinflammation and
improve efficacy antimalarial drug treatment cm.
