background: inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), including crohn's disease (cd) and
ulcerative colitis (uc), characterized chronic intestinal inflammation due
to immunological, microbial, environmental factors genetically predisposed
individuals. advances diagnosis, prognosis, treatment ibd require
the identification robust biomarkers used molecular
classification diverse disease presentations. previously identified five
genes, rela, tnfaip3 (a20), pigr, tnf, il8, whose mrna levels colonic
mucosal biopsies could used multivariate analysis classify patients
with cd based disease behavior responses therapy.
aim: compared expression five biomarkers ibd patients classified
as cd uc, healthy controls.
results: patients cd characterized decreased median
expression tnfaip3, pigr, tnf non-inflamed colonic mucosa compared
to healthy controls. contrast, uc patients exhibited decreased expression of
pigr elevated expression il8 colonic mucosa compared healthy
controls. multivariate analysis combining mrna levels five genes
resulted segregation individuals based disease presentation (cd vs. uc) 
as well severity, i.e., patients remission versus acute colitis 
at time biopsy.
conclusion: propose approach could used model molecular 
classification ibd patients, could enhanced inclusion 
of additional genes identified functional studies, global gene
expression analyses, genome-wide association studies.
