plasmodium falciparum causes severe form malaria responsible
for essentially malaria-related deaths. accumulation various tissues
of erythrocytes infected mature p. falciparum parasites lead to
circulatory disturbances inflammation, thought central element
in pathogenesis disease. mediated interaction parasite
ligands erythrocyte surface range host receptor molecules many
organs tissues. among several proteins protein families implicated in
this process, p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family of
high-molecular weight highly variable antigens appears most
prominent. chapter, aim provide systematic overview the
current knowledge proteins, structure, function, they
are presented erythrocyte surface, var genes encoding are
regulated. role pfemp1 pathogenesis malaria, pfemp1-specific
immune responses, prospect pfemp1-specific vaccination malaria
are also covered briefly.
