apicomplexan parasites rely novel form actin-based motility called
gliding, depends parasite actin polymerization, migrate their
hosts invade cells. however, parasite actins divergent sequence
and function form short, unstable filaments contrast stability
of conventional actin filaments. molecular basis parasite actin filament 
instability relationship gliding motility remain unresolved. we
demonstrate recombinant toxoplasma (tgacti) plasmodium (pfacti and
pfactii) actins polymerized short filaments vitro induced
to form long, stable filaments addition equimolar levels phalloidin.
parasite actins contain conserved phalloidin-binding site determined by
molecular modeling computational docking, yet vary several residues that
are predicted impact filament stability. particular, two residues were
identified form intermolecular contacts different protomers in
conventional actin filaments residues showed non-conservative
differences apicomplexan parasites. substitution divergent residues found
in tgacti mammalian actin resulted formation longer, more
stable filaments vitro. expression stabilized actins t. gondii
increased sensitivity actin-stabilizing compound jasplakinolide and
disrupted normal gliding motility absence treatment. results
identify molecular basis short, dynamic filaments apicomplexan
parasites demonstrate inherent instability parasite actin filaments
is critical adaptation gliding motility.
