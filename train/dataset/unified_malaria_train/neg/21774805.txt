background: emergence plasmodium knowlesi humans, many
cases misdiagnosed microscopy plasmodium malariae due morphological 
similarity contributed needs detection differentiation of
malaria parasites. present, nested pcr targeted plasmodium ssrrna genes has
been described sensitive specific method plasmodium
detection. however, method costly requires trained personnel 
implementation. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), novel nucleic
acid amplification method developed clinical detection p.
knowlesi. sensitivity specificity lamp evaluated comparison 
the results obtained via microscopic examination nested pcr.
methods: lamp assay developed based p. knowlesi genetic material targeting
the apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) gene. method uses six primers that
recognize eight regions target dna amplifies dna within hour
under isothermal conditions (65Â°c) water-bath.
results: lamp highly sensitive detection limit low ten copies
for ama-1. lamp detected malaria parasites confirm cases (n = 13) p.
knowlesi infection (sensitivity, 100%) none negative samples
(specificity, 100%) within hour. lamp demonstrated higher sensitivity compared
to nested pcr successfully detecting sample low parasitaemia (<
0.01%).
conclusion: continuous efforts optimization assay, lamp may
provide simple reliable test detecting p. knowlesi malaria parasites in
areas malaria prevalent.
