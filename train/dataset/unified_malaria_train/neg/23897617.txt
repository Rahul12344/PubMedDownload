prospective studies continue identify malaria parasite genes particular
patterns polymorphism indicate may immune selection, and
the encoded proteins require investigation. sixteen new recombinant protein
reagents designed characterize three polymorphic proteins expressed 
in plasmodium falciparum schizonts merozoites: mspdbl1 (also termed msp3.4)
and mspdbl2 (msp3.8), possess duffy binding-like (dbl) domains, and
surfin4.2, encoded member surface-associated interspersed (surf)
multigene family. testing antigenicities reagents murine
