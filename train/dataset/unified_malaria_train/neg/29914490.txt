background: five species plasmodium known infect humans. proper
treatment malaria, accurate identification parasite species crucial.
the current gold standard malaria diagnosis microscopic examination of
giemsa-stained blood smears. since parasite species identified by
microscopists manually search parasite-infected red blood cells
(rbcs), misdiagnosis due human error tends occur case low
parasitaemia mixed infection. then, molecular methods, polymerase
chain reaction loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), required for
conclusive identification parasite species. however, since molecular
methods highly sensitive, false-positive results tend occur due to
contamination (carry over) target gene products may detected even after
clearance parasites patient's blood. therefore, accurate
detection parasites microscopic examination essential the
definitive diagnosis. thus, method situ lamp parasites was
developed.
results: red blood cell suspensions, including cultured plasmodium falciparum,
strain 3d7, infected-rbcs, dispersed cyclic olefin copolymer (coc) plate 
surfaces rendered hydrophilic reactive ion-etching treatment using samco rie
system (hydrophilic-treated), followed standing 10Â min allow rbcs
to settle plate surface. rinsing plate rpmi 1640 medium, 
monolayers rbcs formed almost entire plate surface. plate 
dried hair drier. rbcs fixed formalin, followed by
permeabilization triton x-100. then, amplification p. falciparum 18s 
rrna gene lamp reaction digoxigenin (dig)-labelled dutp a
specific primer set performed. infected rbcs fluorescence-positive cells
with anti-dig antibodies conjugated fluorescein using fluorescent microscopy
could detected.
conclusions: present work shows potential situ lamp the
identification plasmodium species single cell level on
hydrophilic-treated coc palates, allowing highly sensitive accurate malaria
diagnosis. findings improve efficacy gold standard method for
malaria diagnosis.
