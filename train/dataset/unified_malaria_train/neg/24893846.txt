background: plasmodium ovale relatively unfamiliar chinese staff engaged in
malaria diagnosis. 2013, dried blood spots four unidentified suspected 
ovale malaria samples sent national malaria reference laboratory
(nmrl) reconfirmation.
methods: partial complete, small, subunit ribosomal dna (ssu rdna) sequences 
of four samples obtained pcr-cloning-sequencing method. obtained
sequences analyzed aligning nine ssu rdna
sequences six known plasmodium parasites. phylogenetic tree constructed 
based complete ssu rdna sequences 12 gene sequences derived six 
known plasmodium parasites three babesia parasites. primary structure of
conservative variable regions variant sequences determined also by
comparing six known plasmodium parasites. confirm their
existence genome, redetected primers matching variable
regions. pcr systems aimed roughly detect eukaryotes prokaryotes
respectively also applied search pathogens one four
patients.
results: totally, 19 partial 23 complete ssu rdna sequences obtained from
four samples. except eight variant sequences, similarities among sequences from
same dna sample general high (more 98%). phylogenetic analysis
revealed three cases infected p. ovale wallikeri one p. ovale
curtisi. four variant sequences obtained four samples
relatively showed high similarities (98.5%-100%). identical
variant sequences actually could re-obtained dna sample. their
primary structure conservative variable regions showed quite fit that
of six known plasmodium parasites. test prokaryote pathogens showed
negative tests eukaryotes found dna sequences human p.
ovale parasites.
conclusion: p. ovale wallikeri p. ovale curtisi infections present
in imported malaria cases china. new type partial ssu rdna sequence which
assumed express certain life stage p. ovale obtained p. 
ovale wallikeri p. ovale curtisi samples. discovery would supply
information clues identify understand p. ovale parasites more
accurately.
