avian haemosporidian parasites particularly diverse widespread. date, 
more 3,000 distinct cytochrome b lineages recorded, 
present extremely wide geographical distributions, even including multiple
continents. whether isolates represent one several cryptic species
remains unknown. carried case study siskin1, common
haemosporidian parasite lineage belonging morphologically described
species haemoproteus tartakovskyi. shed light evolutionary origin, we
investigated divergence siskin1 isolates obtained siskins and
redpolls europe (russia sweden) house finches north america
(mexico). first, used sequence capture small data set (2 russian isolates
and 1 mexican isolate) investigate genetic structure based the
full-length mitochondrial genome ∼1,000 genes. mitochondrial genomes of
russian isolates identical differed mexican one
at 6 positions. nuclear divergence russian mexican isolates was
on average 2.8%, close observed 2 species malaria
parasites respectively infect humans (plasmodium falciparum) gorillas
(plasmodium praefalciparum). second, used expanded data set (15 samples in
total) investigate genetic structure 3 genes known involved in
host invasion. european isolates identical across sequenced genes,
whereas mexican isolates highly diverse. lack shared alleles
between european mexican populations suggests might diverged
in isolation without gene flow. malavi database examined lineages
most similar siskin1 barcode fragment (part cyt b gene) found
that recorded north south america. suggests
that lineage siskin1 originated north america subsequently spread to
europe. analyses support cyt b gene barcoding region useful
marker identification avian haemosporidian lineages classify them
into clusters closely related parasites, investigate species
limits evolutionary history, molecular data multiple faster-evolving
genes required.
