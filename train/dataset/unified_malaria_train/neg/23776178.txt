abs inhibit plasmodium falciparum invasion erythrocytes form important
component human immunity malaria, key target ags largely
unknown. phenotypic variation p. falciparum mediates evasion inhibitory
abs, contributing capacity p. falciparum cause repeat chronic
infections. however, ags involved mediating immune evasion been
defined, studies function human abs limited. study, 
used novel approaches determine importance p. falciparum
erythrocyte-binding ags (ebas), important invasion ligands, targets 
of human invasion-inhibitory abs define role contributing immune 
evasion variation function. evaluated invasion-inhibitory
activity acquired abs malaria-exposed children adults kenya,
using p. falciparum disruption genes encoding eba140, eba175, eba181,
either individually combined eba140/eba175 eba175/eba181 double
knockouts. findings provide important new evidence variation the
expression function ebas plays important role evasion of
acquired abs substantial amount phenotypic diversity results from
variation expression different ebas contributes immune evasion by
p. falciparum. three ebas identified important targets naturally
acquired inhibitory abs demonstrated differential inhibition parental
parasites greater eba knockout lines. knowledge help advance
malaria vaccine development suggests multiple invasion ligands need to
be targeted overcome capacity p. falciparum immune evasion.
