wuchereria bancrofti (wb) widely distributed three nematodes
known cause lymphatic filariasis (lf), two brugia malayi and
brugia timori. current tools available monitor lf limited diagnostic
tests targeting dna repeats, filarial antigens, anti-filarial antibodies.
while tools useful detection surveillance, elimination programs
have yet take full advantage molecular typing inferring infection
history, strain fingerprinting, evolution. date, molecular typing
approaches included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted
sequencing, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapds). studies have
revealed much wb biology. example, one study papua new guinea
researchers identified 5 major strains widespread many minor
strains exhibit geographic stratification. genome data, rare,
has utilized reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa the
onchocercidae (the clade filarial nematodes) identify gene synteny. 
phylogeny reveals speciation common ancestor b. malayi 
wb occurred around 5-6 millions years ago shared ancestry filarial 
nematodes recent 15 million years ago. discoveries hold promise for
gene discovery identifying drug targets species amenable 
in vivo experiments. continued technological developments whole genome
sequencing data analysis likely replace many forms molecular
typing, multiplying amount data available population structure, genetic
diversity, phylogenetics. widely available, addition population
genetic data genomic studies hasten elimination lf parasites
like wb. infectious disease control programs benefited greatly from
population genetics data recently population genomics data. however,
while currently surplus data diseases like malaria hiv,
there scarcity data filarial nematodes. falling cost of
genome sequencing, research filarial nematodes could benefit addition
of population genetics statistics phylogenetics especially dealing with
elimination programs. comprehensive review focusing population genetics of
filarial nematode yet exist. goal provide current
overview molecular epidemiology w. bancrofti (wb) primary causative
agent lf. begin reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques 
with specific focus genomic population datasets. next, used whole
mitochondrial genome data construct phylogeny examine evolutionary
history onchocercidae. then, provide perspective aid in
understanding population genetic techniques translate modern epidemiology.
finally, introduce concept genomic epidemiology provide some
examples aid future studies wb.
