artemisinin, extracted medicinal herb artemisia annua, widely used to
treat malaria shown potent anticancer activity. artemisinin been
found effective experimental visceral cutaneous leishmaniasis. 
despite extensive research understand complex mechanism resistance to
artemisinin, several questions remain unanswered. artesunate (art)-resistant 
line leishmania donovani selected cellular mechanisms associated 
resistance artemisinin investigated. art-resistant (as-r) parasites
showed reduced susceptibility towards art promastigote amastigote
stage compared art sensitive (wt) parasites. wt as-r parasites both
more susceptible art early log phase growth compared late log
phase. as-r parasites infective host macrophages (p < 0.05).
evaluation parasites' tolerance towards host microbicidal mechanisms revealed 
that as-r parasites tolerant complement-mediated lysis and
nitrosative stress. ros levels modulated presence art as-r
parasites infected macrophages. interestingly, infection macrophages as-r
parasites led modulated levels host interleukins, il-2 il-10, in
addition nitric oxide. additionally, as-r parasites showed upregulated
expression genes unfolded protein response pathway including
methyltransferase domain-containing protein (hsp40) flagellar attachment zone
protein (prefoldin), reported associated art resistance in
plasmodium falciparum malaria. study presents vitro model of
artemisinin-resistant leishmania parasite cellular mechanisms associated with
art resistance leishmania.
