malaria parasites evolved complicated life cycle alternating two
hosts. gametocytes produced vertebrate hosts obligatory for
natural transmission parasites mosquito vectors. mechanism 
sexual development plasmodium focus extensive studies. 
postgenomic era, advent genome-wide analytical tools genetic
manipulation technology enabled rapid advancement knowledge this
area. patterns gene expression sexual development, molecular
distinction two sexes, mechanisms underlying subsequent formation of
gametes fertilization progressively elucidated. however, 
triggers mechanism sexual development remain largely unknown. article
provides update understanding molecular cellular events
associated decision commitment sexual development regulation 
of gene expression gametocytogenesis. insights molecular
mechanisms gametocyte development essential designing proper control
strategies interruption malaria transmission ultimate elimination.
