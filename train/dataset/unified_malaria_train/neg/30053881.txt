background: plasmodium 18s rrna biomarker used monitor blood-stage
infections malaria clinical trials. plasmodium sporozoites also express this
biomarker, conflicting evidence long sporozoite-derived
18s rrna persists peripheral blood. present blood extended
timeframe, sporozoite-derived 18s rrna could complicate use blood-stage
biomarker.
methods: blood samples plasmodium yoelii infected mice tested for
plasmodium 18s rrna coding genes (rdna) using sensitive quantitative
reverse transcription pcr quantitative pcr assays, respectively. blood and
tissues plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (pfspz)-infected rhesus macaques
were similarly tested.
results: mice, p. yoelii sporozoite inoculation blood collection were
performed site (tail vein), low level rdna positivity persisted for
2 days post-infection. compared intact parasites high rrna-to-rdna
ratios, low level positivity accompanied increase rrna-to-rdna,
indicating detection residual, non-viable parasite rdna. p. yoelii
sporozoites administered via retro-orbital vein blood sampled by
cardiac puncture, neither p. yoelii 18s rrna rdna detected 24 h
post-infection. similarly, p. falciparum 18s rrna detected blood 
of rhesus macaques 3 days intravenous injection extremely high doses
of pfspz. plasmodium 18s rrna rhesus livers increased approximately
101-fold 3 6 days post infection, indicating liver-stage proliferation.
conclusions: beyond first hours injection, sporozoite-derived
plasmodium 18s rrna detected peripheral blood. diagnostics based on
18s rrna unlikely confounded sporozoite inocula human clinical
trials.
