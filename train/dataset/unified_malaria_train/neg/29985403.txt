genome-wide analysis transcription malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum revealed robust variation steady-state mrna abundance
throughout 48-h intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc), suggesting 
this process highly dynamic tightly regulated. here, utilize rapid
4-thiouracil (4-tu) incorporation via pyrimidine salvage specifically label,
capture, quantify newly-synthesized rna transcripts every hour throughout 
the idc. high-resolution global analysis transcriptome captures the
timing rate transcription newly synthesized mrna vivo,
revealing active transcription throughout idc stages. using statistical
model predict mrna dynamics contributing total mrna abundance at
each timepoint, find varying degrees transcription stabilization for
each mrna corresponding developmental transitions. finally, results
provide new insight co-regulation mrnas throughout idc through
regulatory dna sequence motifs, thereby expanding understanding p.
falciparum mrna dynamics.
