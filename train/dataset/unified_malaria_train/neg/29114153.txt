plasmodium vivax parasite causes largest number malaria infection 
malarious areas world including iran. considering transfer genetic
dynamics parasite population specific area help us predict the
spread infection either emergence new cases drug resistance the
context elimination program malarious areas. study genetic
diversity common alleles given geographical area, vaccine immune 
level studies important. purpose study know status 
of p. vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) polymorphism patients infected 
the parasite malaria endemic southeastern iran. fragment gene
corresponding pvdbp thirty p. vivax malaria infected individuals was
amplified. 1176Â bp band related fragment purified pcr-rflp
method employed using enzymatic digestion psti rsai restriction
enzymes. ten percent samples sent sequencing. pcr-rflp showed that
99.7% samples cut together, either psti enzyme the
enzyme rsai. case, 2 isolates unlike others. findings
revealed least 96% identity among isolates nucleotide
level. amino acid pattern pvdbp iranian isolates showed little
discrepancies pvdbp genes recorded genbank.
sequencing pvdbp isolates iranian p. vivax infected patients showed low
level genetic polymorphism among them. results study prepare
valuable information malaria policy makers intend malaria
control program.
