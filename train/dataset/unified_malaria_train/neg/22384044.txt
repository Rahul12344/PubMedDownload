the combination therapy artemisinin-derivative artemether (art) with
lumefantrine (lm) (coartem®) important malaria treatment regimen many
endemic countries. resistance artemisinin already reported, is
feared lm resistance (lmr) could also evolve quickly. therefore molecular
markers used track coartem® efficacy urgently needed. often, 
stable resistance arises initial, unstable phenotypes identified
in vitro. used plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistant
reference strain v1s induce lmr vitro culturing parasite under
continuous drug pressure 16 months. initial ic(50) (inhibitory
concentration kills 50% parasite population) 24 nm. resulting
resistant strain v1s(lm), obtained culture estimated 166 cycles
under lm pressure, grew steadily 378 nm lm, corresponding 15 times the
ic(50) parental strain. however, two weeks culturing v1s(lm) in
drug-free medium, ic(50) returned initial, parental strain
v1s. transient drug tolerance associated major changes gene
expression profiles: using pfsanger affymetrix custom array, identified
184 differentially expressed genes v1s(lm). among 18 known and
putative transporters including multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1), the
multidrug resistance associated protein v-type h+ pumping pyrophosphatase
2 (pfvp2) well genes associated fatty acid metabolism. addition 
detected clear selective advantage provided two genomic loci parasites
grown lm drug pressure, suggesting all, genes
contribute development lm tolerance--they may prove useful molecular
markers monitor p. falciparum lm susceptibility.
