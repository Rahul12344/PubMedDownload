the development sterilizing cost-effective vaccine malaria
remains major problem despite recent advances. study, is
demonstrated two antigens p. falciparum ub05, ub09 chimera
ub05-09 serve protective immunity markers eliciting higher t-cell
responses malaria semi-immune subjects (sis) frequently sick subjects 
(fss) could used distinguish two groups. ub05, ub09 ub05-09
were cloned, expressed e. coli, purified used stimulate pbmcs isolated 
from 63 subjects malaria endemic area, ifn-γ production, was
measured elispot assay. polymorphism ub09 gene malaria
infected population also studied pcr/sequencing gene in
p. falciparum field isolates. three antigens preferentially recognized
by pbmcs sis. ifn-γ production induced antigens correlated the
absence fever parasitaemia. ub09 shown relatively well-conserved
in nature. concluded ub05, ub09 chimera ub05-09 posses t-cell 
epitopes associated protection malaria could thus be
used distinguish sis fss eventhough acute infection malaria been
shown reduce cytokine production studies. investigations of
these antigens potential diagnostic and/or vaccine candidates malaria 
indicated.
