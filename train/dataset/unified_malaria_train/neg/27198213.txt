background: recent studies experimental mice shown mild deficiency
of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) enzyme confers protection 
malaria, thus providing important basis hypothesis mthfr
polymorphism, i.e. c677t, might subjected selection pressure against
malaria. present study undertaken malaria endemic region north
east india assess whether similar selection advantage exists genes
in folate metabolism pathway.
methods: total 401 subjects including 131 symptomatic malaria, 97
asymptomatic malaria 173 normal healthy controls analysed nine
polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [snps] eight genes and
insertion/deletion one gene): mthfr c677t, methionine synthase reductase
(mtrr) a66g, glutamate carboxypeptidase ii (gcpii) c1561t, cystathionine
beta-synthase (cbs) 844ins68, reduced folate carrier-1 (rfc-1) g80a, serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) c1420t, methionine synthase (mtr) a2756g, mthfr
g1793a (d 919g), glycine n-methyltransferase (gnmt) 1289 pcr-rflp technique.
differences frequencies genotype distribution polymorphic marker
between groups evaluated.
results: mtrr a2756g, shmt c1420t, gcpii c1561t, mtrr a2756g gnmt c1289t 
rfc1 g80a polymorphisms showed significantly different prevalence between
different groups analyzed. significant differences seen the
distribution polymorphisms.
conclusions: study gives clue possible selection specific
polymorphisms genes involved folate metabolism pathway malaria
parasite.
