artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) standard care treat 
uncomplicated falciparum malaria. however, resistance artemisinins, defined as
delayed parasite clearance therapy, emerged southeast asia, 
spread resistance sub-saharan africa could devastating consequences.
artemisinin resistance associated southeast asia multiple
nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (ns-snps) propeller domain
of gene encoding plasmodium falciparum k13 protein (k13pd). k13pd
ns-snps seen africa, relevance mutations is
unclear. assess whether act use selected specific k13pd mutations, 
compared k13pd genetic diversity clinical isolates collected and
after implementation act use seven sites across uganda. detected
k13pd ns-snps 16 683 (2.3%) clinical isolates collected 1999 and
2004 26 716 (3.6%) isolates collected 2012 2016 (p = 0.16),
representing total 29 different polymorphisms 27 codons. individual
ns-snps usually detected once, none found 0.7% of
the isolates. three snps (c469f, p574l, a675v) associated delayed
clearance southeast asia seen samples collected 2012 2016,
each single isolate. differences diversity following implementation of
act use found seven sites, evidence selective
pressures acting locus. results suggest selection acts 
impacting k13pd diversity uganda.
