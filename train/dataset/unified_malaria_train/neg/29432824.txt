aluminum salts used vaccine adjuvants >50 years, are
currently present least 146 licensed vaccines worldwide. study we
examined whether adsorption army liposome formulation (alf) aluminum
salt already antigen adsorbed might result improved immune
potency aluminum-adsorbed antigen. alf composed family anionic 
liposome-based adjuvants, liposomes contain synthetic phospholipids 
having dimyristoyl fatty acyl groups, cholesterol monophosphoryl lipid a
(mpla). certain candidate vaccines, alf added aluminum hydroxide 
(ah) gel second adjuvant form alfa. show different methods
of preparation alf changed physical structures alf alfa.
liposomes containing saponin qs21 (alfq) also mixed ah form
alfqa effective combination. study, first adsorbed one two
different antigens ah, either tetanus toxoid conjugated 34 copies a
hapten (morhap), used candidate heroin vaccine, gp140
protein derived envelope protein hiv-1. co-adsorbed alf or
alfq ah form alfa alfqa. case, immune potency the
antigen adsorbed ah greatly increased co-adsorbing either alf alfq
to ah. based igg subtype cytokine analysis elispot, alfa induced
predominately th2-type response alfq alfqa induced balanced
th1/th2 responses.
