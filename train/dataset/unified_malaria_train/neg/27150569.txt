motivation: biological processes involve much complex interplay cellular 
molecules different molecular levels, interplay may exhibit various
co-expression patterns explicitly representing cellular inner regulation
mechanism. whereas, coexpression patterns cannot necessarily conserved across 
the different molecular levels complex regulation processes involved even
after transcripts produced. investigation co-expression propagation from
transcript level protein level reflect inner regulation effects in
function states cells.
results: study, perform comparative analysis gene coexpression
patterns plasmodium falciparum. investigate coexpression patterns
propagation transcript level protein level reveal underlying
biological meaning post-transcriptional translational mechanism. our
systems-level approach shows posttranscriptional translational
regulation gene co-expression pace protein level mechanistically adjusted
to higher synchronicity. moreover, co-expression patterns protein level are
more linked function categories, co-expression time point 
is related binding categories, co-expression delayed several
time points related activity categories. therefore,
posttranscriptional translational regulation modulates co-expression
relationships molecules meeting function demands.
