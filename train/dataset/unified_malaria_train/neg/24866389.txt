blood feeding integral process required physiological functions and
propagation malaria vector anopheles. blood feeding, presence of
the malaria parasite, plasmodium blood induces several host effector
molecules including micrornas play important roles development and
maturation parasite within mosquito. present study undertaken 
to elucidate dynamic expression mirnas gonotrophic cycle and
parasite development anopheles stephensi. using next generation sequencing
technology, identified 126 mirnas 17 novel mirnas. mirnas
were validated northern hybridization cloning. blood feeding and
parasitized blood feeding mosquitoes revealed regulation 13 16
mirnas respectively. expression profiling mirnas revealed that
significant mirnas down-regulated upon parasitized blood feeding a
repertoire mirnas showing stage specific up-regulation. expression profiles of
significantly modulated mirnas validated real time pcr. target
prediction regulated mirnas revealed overlapping targeting different
mirnas. targets included several metabolic pathways including metabolic,
redox homeostasis protein processing machinery components. analysis
revealed tight regulation specific mirnas post blood feeding parasite
infection an. stephensi. regulated expression suggests possible role of
these mirnas gonotrophic cycle mosquito. another set mirnas were
also significantly regulated 42 h 5 days post infection indicating
parasite stage-specific role host mirnas. study result better
understanding role mirnas gonotrophic cycle parasite
development mosquito probably facilitate devising novel malaria
control strategies vector level.
