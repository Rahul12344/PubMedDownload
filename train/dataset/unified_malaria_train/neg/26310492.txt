background: increasing efforts bring high-throughput systems biology
techniques bear complex animal model systems, often goal learning
about underlying regulatory network structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks). 
however, complex animal model systems typically significant limitations on
cohort sizes, number samples, ability perform follow-up and
validation experiments. constraints particularly problematic many
current network learning approaches, require large numbers samples and
may predict many regulatory relationships actually exist.
results: here, test idea leveraging accuracy efficiency of
classifiers, construct high-quality networks capture important
interactions variables datasets samples. start a
previously-developed tree-like bayesian classifier generalize network
learning approach allow arbitrary depth complexity tree-like
networks. using four diverse sample networks, demonstrate approach
performs consistently better low sample sizes sparse candidate
algorithm, representative approach comparison known to
generate bayesian networks high positive predictive value. develop and
demonstrate resampling-based approach enable identification viable 
root learned tree-like network, important cases root a
network known priori. also develop demonstrate integrated
resampling-based approach reduction variable space learning 
the network. finally, demonstrate utility approach via the
analysis transcriptional dataset malaria challenge non-human
primate model system, macaca mulatta, suggesting potential capture
indicators earliest stages cellular differentiation during
leukopoiesis.
conclusions: demonstrate starting effective efficient
approaches creating classifiers, identify interesting tree-like
network structures significant ability capture relationships the
training data. approach represents promising strategy inferring
networks high positive predictive value constraint small
numbers samples, meeting need continue grow more
