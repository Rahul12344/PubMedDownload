s-adenosyl-l-methionine (sam)-dependent methyltransferases represent diverse
group enzymes catalyze transfer methyl group methyl donor
sam nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur carbon atoms large number biologically
active large small molecules. modifications play major role the
regulation various biological functions gene expression, signaling,
nuclear division metabolism. three-step sam-dependent methylation of
phosphoethanolamine form phosphocholine catalyzed phosphoethanolamine
n-methyltransferases (pmts) emerged important biochemical step the
synthesis major phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, eukaryotes.
pmts identified nematodes, plants, african clawed frogs, zebrafish, 
the florida lancelet, proteobacteria human malaria parasites. data
accumulated thus far suggest important role enzymes growth and
development. review summarizes published studies biochemical and
genetic characterization enzymes, discusses evolution and
their suitability targets development therapies parasitic
infections, well bioengineering development nutritional and
stress-resistant plants.
