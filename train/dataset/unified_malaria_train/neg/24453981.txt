it well understood apicomplexan parasites, malaria pathogen
plasmodium, descended free-living algae, maintain vestigial
chloroplast secondarily lost genes photosynthetic function.
recently, two fully photosynthetic relatives parasitic apicomplexans been
identified, 'chromerid' algae chromera velia vitrella brassicaformis,
which retain photosynthesis genes within chloroplasts. elucidating the
processes governing gene expression chromerid chloroplasts might provide
valuable insights origins parasitism apicomplexans. have

precursors covering multiple photosynthesis genes, appears associated
with high levels transcript abundance. propose changes the
