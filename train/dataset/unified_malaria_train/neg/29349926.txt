pathogens release extracellular vesicles (evs) cell-cell communication
and host modulation. evs plasmodium falciparum, deadliest malaria
parasite species, transfer drug resistance genes parasites. evs 
late-stage parasite-infected rbc (irbc-evs) immunostimulatory affect
endothelial cell permeability, little known evs early stage
irbc. detected parasite virulence factor pfemp1, responsible 
irbc adherence major contributor disease severity, evs, to
12-hr post-rbc invasion. furthermore, using pfemp1 transport knockout parasites, 
we determined evs originated inside irbc rather irbc
surface. proteomic analysis detected 101 parasite 178 human proteins in
irbc-evs. primary human monocytes stimulated irbc-evs released low levels of
inflammatory cytokines showed transcriptomic changes. stimulation with
irbc-evs pfemp1 knockout parasites induced gene expression changes 
affected pathways involved defence response, stress response, response 
cytokines, suggesting novel function pfemp1 present evs. show for
the first time presence pfemp1 early stage p. falciparum irbc-evs and
the effects evs primary human monocytes, uncovering new mechanism
of potential parasite pathogenesis host interaction.
