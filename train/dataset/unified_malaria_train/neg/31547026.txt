eicosanoids bioactive signaling lipids derived oxidation fatty
acids act important regulators immune homeostasis inflammation. as
a result, effective anti-inflammatory drugs widely used reduce pain 
and inflammation target key eicosanoid biosynthesis enzymes. conserved from
vertebrates insects, use eicosanoid pathway inhibitors offer
opportunities evaluate roles eicosanoids less-characterized insect
systems. study, examine potential roles eicosanoids malaria 
parasite survival mosquito anopheles gambiae. using plasmodium oocyst
numbers evaluate parasite infection, general specific inhibitors of
eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways evaluated. following administration 
dexamethasone indomethacin, respective inhibitors phospholipid a2 (pla2)
and cyclooxygenase (cox), oocyst numbers unaffected. however, inhibition 
lipoxygenase (lox) activity use esculetin significantly increased 
oocyst survival. contrast,
12-[[(tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]dec-1-ylamino)carbonyl]amino]-dodecanoic acid (auda),
an inhibitor epoxide hydroxylase (eh), decreased oocyst numbers. these
experiments validated rnai experiments silence candidate 
genes homologous eh an. gambiae confirm contributions to
plasmodium development. similar results auda treatment, silencing
of eh significantly reduced oocyst numbers. results imply specific
eicosanoids an. gambiae either agonist antagonistic roles on
malaria parasite survival mosquito host.
