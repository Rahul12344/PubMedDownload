prothonotary warbler (protonotaria citrea) shown long-term decline in
abundance united states. long-range migrant, warblers are
exposed parasites tropical temperate regions. focus this
study use molecular techniques examine temporal prevalence patterns
of heamosopridian parasites plasmodium haemoproteus breeding prothonotary 
warblers. prevalence (presence absence) plasmodium haemoproteus
species assayed using primer sets cytochrome b gene the
mitochondrial dna. blood samples obtained 187 adult prothonotary
warblers collected 3 central virginia, u.s.a., breeding sites. the
relationship haemosporidian parasite infections reproductive success 
also examined. found 71% captured prothonotary warblers were
infected haemosporidian parasites, specifically, 36% prevalence for
haemoproteus spp. 44% prevalence plasmodium spp., 2008
breeding season; parasites, prevalence increased throughout season. 
we found significant variation haemosporidian parasite prevalence across the
breeding season strongly site specific. conversely, found no
significant effects haemosporidian parasite infections reproductive
success prothonotary warblers. sharp contrast recent reports
suggesting considerable effects parasites reproductive success of
wild birds.
