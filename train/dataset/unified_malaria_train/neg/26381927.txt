apicomplexa unicellular parasites causing important human animal
diseases, including malaria toxoplasmosis. pathogens possess 
relict essential plastid, apicoplast. apicoplast acquired by
secondary endosymbiosis red alga flagellated eukaryotic protist. 
as result apicoplast surrounded four membranes. complex
structure necessitates system transport signals translocons allowing
nuclear encoded proteins find way specific apicoplast
sub-compartments. previous studies identified translocons traversing two the
four apicoplast membranes. provide functional support role 
apicomplexan toc75 homolog apicoplast protein transport. identify two
apicomplexan genes encoding toc75 sam50, members omp85 protein
family. localize respective proteins apicoplast the
mitochondrion toxoplasma plasmodium. show toxoplasma toc75 
essential parasite growth depletion results rapid defect in
the import apicoplast stromal proteins import proteins the
outer compartments affected secondary consequence organelle
loss. observations along homology toc75 suggest potential
role transport second innermost membrane.
