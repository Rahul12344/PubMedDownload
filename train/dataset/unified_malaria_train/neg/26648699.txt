malaria one serious natural hazards faced human society.
although plant leaves indigofera oblongifolia used treatment
of malaria saudi arabian society, laboratory-based evidence for
the effectiveness safety plant. study therefore designed to
investigate antimalarial spleen protective activity i. oblongifolia
leaf extract (iole) mice. three doses (100, 200 300 mg/kg) iole were
used treat mice infected plasmodium chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes.
the suppressive effect produced 100 mg/kg dose parasitemia highly
significant compared infected nontreated group. dose also able to
repair change thickness mice spleen significantly lower the
number apoptotic cells spleen. moreover, i. oblongifolia also altered
gene expression infected spleen. day 7 postinfection, mrna
expression six genes - immune response functions - upregulated by
more twofold, 24 genes downregulated. among the
differentially up- downregulated genes effect iole, we
quantified expression ccl8, saa3, cd209a, cd209b mrnas. expression
data, determined microarrays, largely consistent expression
analyses performed several arbitrarily selected genes using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). based results, i. oblongifolia exhibits
antimalarial activity could protect spleen p. chabaudi-induced
injury.
