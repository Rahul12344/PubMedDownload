village chicken production, traditional, small-scale, extensive backyard
poultry industry, profitable local farmers myanmar. however,
there scanty information available concerning infection chickens 
with avian pathogens, including haemoprotozoan parasites. present study,
we provide first report microscopic detection molecular identification
of leucocytozoon plasmodium parasites seven different areas myanmar. 
leucocytozoon gametocytes detected 17.6% (81/461) blood smears
from village chickens. nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting
leucocytozoon mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) genes 17.6% positive rate.
although positive rate nested pcr targeting plasmodium/haemoproteus cyt b 
was 34.3%, pcr protocol observed possibly amplify dna certain
species leucocytozoon. obvious clinical signs infected
birds. statistical analysis microscopic detection pcr detection rates 
using age sex birds internal factors revealed statistical 
significances differed according study area. sequencing 32 pcr
products obtained study area revealed infection leucocytozoon
caulleryi three birds, leucocytozoon sabrazesi two birds, leucocytozoon
schoutedeni two birds, leucocytozoon sp. eighteen birds, plasmodium
juxtanucleare seven birds; however, haemoproteus infection detected.
while l. sabrazesi detected chickens central region myanmar,
the haemosporidians detected different areas. the
haplotype analysis, detected 17 haemosporidian cyt b haplotypes, including two
for l. caulleryi, one l. sabrazesi, two l. schoutedeni, nine for
leucocytozoon sp., three p. juxtanucleare. phylogenetic analysis the
cyt b haplotypes revealed considerably close genetic relationship among chicken
haemosporidians detected myanmar, thailand, malaysia. results
indicate well-recognized widespread species chicken leucocytozoon and
plasmodium distributed nationwide myanmar, providing new insights the
ecosystem control strategies haemosporidian parasites domesticated
chickens myanmar.
