antigenic diversity major concern malaria vaccine development that
requires considered developing malaria vaccine. plasmodium falciparum 
thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (pftrap) leading malaria vaccine
candidate antigen. current study, investigated level genetic
diversity natural selection pftrap sequences p. falciparum isolates
from iran (n = 47). gene diversity iranian pftrap sequences also
compared available global pftrap sequences deposited genbank or
plasmodb databases (n = 220). comparison iranian pftrap sequences t9/96
reference sequence showed presence 35 amino acid changes 32 positions
and limited variation repeat sequences, leading 13 distinct haplotypes.
the overall nucleotide diversity (π) ectodomain iranian pftrap
sequences 0.00444 ± 0.00043, highest diversity domain iv.
alignment comparison global pftrap sequences t9/96 reference sequence
indicated 96 amino acid replacements well extensive variable repeat
sequences (9-23 repeats), led 192 haplotypes. among global isolates,
the lowest nucleotide diversity detected french guianan
(0.00428 ± 0.00163) iranian (0.00444 ± 0.00043) pftrap sequences, the
most variation observed domains ii iv populations. dn-ds
value displayed evidence positive selection due recombination and
immune system pressure. fst analysis revealed gene flow african
populations; however, genetic differentiation observed iranian 
populations probably due gene flow barriers. conserved variable
epitopes predicted b- t-cell epitopes pftrap antigen. obtained
results study could helpful developing pftrap-based malaria
vaccine.
