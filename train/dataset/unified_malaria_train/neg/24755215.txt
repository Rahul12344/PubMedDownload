the malaria parasite experiences significant amount redox stress 
growth human erythrocytes heavily relies secretory functions for
pathogenesis. certainly, parasite equipped machinery tackle
perturbations secretory pathway, like unfolded protein response
pathway higher eukaryotes. bioinformatics analysis revealed complete
absence genes involved canonical unfolded protein response pathway in
plasmodium falciparum. accordingly, parasite unable up-regulate
endoplasmic reticulum (er) chaperones er-associated degradation response to
dtt-mediated er stress. global profiling gene expression upon dtt treatment
revealed network ap2 transcription factors targets being
activated. overall outcome up-regulation genes involved protein
export sexual stage parasite life cycle culminating in
gametocytogenesis. results suggest malaria parasite uses er stress
as cue switch transmissible sexual stages.
