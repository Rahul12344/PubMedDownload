malaria sterning public health concern india contribute major
part malaria burden southeast asia. populated diverse
geographic conditions makes suitable place sustaining malaria parasite
in india. anti-malarial resistance major concern battle against
malaria, identified molecular markers aid us monitor drug
resistance endemic areas. aim current study determine the
genotype drug resistance associated genes pvmdr-1 pvcrt-o four
different regions india. especially puducherry jodhpur, no
prior studies focused screening drug resistance genes p. vivax parasite.
a total 240 positive p. vivax infected patient samples collected from
four tertiary care hospitals four different regions india, namely,
puducherry (pdy), mangaluru (maq), cuttack (ctc), jodhpur (jdh). samples were
screened microscopy, rdt, qbc, dna extracted vivax
mono-infection confirmed nested pcr. randomly selected amplicons were
further subjected nucleotide sequencing. prevalence k10 insertion in
pvcrt-o gene detected 18.8% pdy, 12.5% maq 6.3% ctc p.
vivax isolates, whereas change nucleotide identified p. vivax
isolates collected jdh region. based f1076l mutation pvmdr-1 gene,
resistant p. vivax isolates highly predominant regions, jdh and
ctc, 100%, followed maq 93.3% pdy 73.3%. study showed 
less frequency pvcrt-o high frequency pvmdr-1 gene variants associated 
with cq resistance, act indicator onset p. vivax drug
resistance trend four different regions india. due poor phenotypic
studies available p. vivax parasite, present study data cq resistance
based pvcrt-o pvmdr-1 markers assist providing base-line data
for future monitoring drug resistance.
