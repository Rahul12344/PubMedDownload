malaria infectious disease affecting humans, transmitted the
bite anopheles mosquitoes harboring sporozoites parasitic protozoans
belonging genus plasmodium. despite past achievements control the
protozoan disease, malaria still remains significant health threat now.
in study, cloned characterized full-unit plasmodium yoelii genes 
encoding merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), circumsporozoite protein (csp), 
duffy-binding protein (dbp), applied investigations to
obtain potent protective vaccines rodent malaria model, due their
specific expression patterns parasite life cycle. recombinant
fragments corresponding middle c-terminal regions pymsp1 pycsp,
respectively, displayed strong reactivity p. yoelii-infected mice sera.
specific native antigens invoking strong humoral immune response the
primary secondary infections p. yoelii also abundantly detected in
experimental icr mice. low negligible parasitemia observed the
secondary infected mice likely result neutralizing action 
protective antibodies. identification antigenic proteins might provide
the necessary information means characterize additional vaccine candidate 
antigens, selected solely ability produce protective antibodies.
