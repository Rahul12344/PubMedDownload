insecticidal fungi represent promising alternative chemical pesticides for
disease vector control. here, show pathogenic fungus beauveria
bassiana exports microrna-like rna (bba-milr1) hijacks host
rna-interference machinery mosquito cells binding argonaute 1 (ago1).
bba-milr1 highly expressed fungal penetration mosquito
integument, suppresses host immunity silencing expression mosquito 
toll receptor ligand sp√§tzle 4 (spz4). later, upon entering hemocoel,
bba-milr1 expression decreased, avoids induction host proteinase 
clipb9 activates melanization response. thus, results indicate 
the pathogen deploys cross-kingdom small-rna effector attenuates host
immunity facilitates infection.
