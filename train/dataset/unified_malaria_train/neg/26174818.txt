the increasing prevalence toxoplasma gondii infection human population 
in republic korea (= korea) due various reasons increase 
in meat consumption. however, importance cats transmitting t. gondii
infection oocysts humans seldom assessed. total 300
fecal samples stray cats captured around seoul june august 2013 were
examined t. gondii b1 gene (indicating presence oocysts) using
nested-pcr. fourteen (4.7%) 300 cats examined positive b1 gene.
female cats (7.5%) showed higher prevalence male cats (1.4%). cats younger
than 3 months (5.5%) showed higher prevalence cats (1.5%) older 3
months. laboratory passage positive samples, fecal suspension (0.2
ml) b1 gene positive cats orally inoculated experimental mice. brain 
tissues mice obtained 40 days examined presence 
tissue cysts. two isolates successfully passaged (designated knih-1 and
knih-2) molecularly analyzed using sag5d sag5e gene sequences.
the sag5d sag5e gene sequences showed high homologies me49 strain
(less virulent strain). results indicated importance stray cats in
transmitting t. gondii humans korea, revealed detection b1 gene in
fecal samples. t. gondii isolates cats successfully passaged the
laboratory first time korea.
