telomeres define ends chromosomes protecting eukaryotic cells from
chromosome instability eventual cell death. complex regulation of
telomeres involves various proteins including telomerase, specialized 
ribonucleoprotein responsible telomere maintenance. telomeres chromosomes 
of malaria parasites kept constant length blood stage
proliferation. 7-bp telomere repeat sequence universal across different
plasmodium species (gggttt/ca), though average telomere length varies. the
catalytic subunit telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert), is
present sequenced plasmodium species approximately three times
larger eukaryotic terts. plasmodium rna component tert has
recently identified silico. strategy delete gene encoding tert
via double cross-over (dxo) homologous recombination undertaken study 
telomerase function p. berghei. expression tert rna component 
(tr) p. berghei blood stages analysed western blotting northern
analysis. average telomere length measured several plasmodium species
using telomere restriction fragment (trf) analysis. tert tr detected 
blood stages average telomere length âˆ¼ 950 bp established. deletion 
the tert gene performed using standard transfection methodologies show
the presence tert- mutants transfected parasite populations. cloning of
tert- mutants attempted multiple times without success. thorough
analysis transfected parasite populations parasite obtained from
extensive parasite cloning populations provide evidence so
called delayed death phenotype observed different organisms lacking tert.
the findings indicate tert essential p. berghei cell survival. the
study extends current knowledge telomere biology malaria parasites 
validates investigations identify telomerase inhibitors induce
parasite cell death.
