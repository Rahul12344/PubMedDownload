although plasmodium vivax leading cause malaria around world, 
handful vivax antigens studied vaccine development. here, we
investigated genetic signatures selection geospatial genetic diversity 
two leading vivax vaccine antigens--plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 
(pvmsp-1) plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp). using scalable
next-generation sequencing, deep-sequenced amplicons 42 kda region of
pvmsp-1 (n = 44) complete gene pvcsp (n = 47) cambodian isolates.
these sequences compared global parasite populations obtained from
genbank. using combination statistical phylogenetic methods assess
for selection population structure, found strong evidence balancing
selection 42 kda region pvmsp-1, varied significantly the
length gene, consistent immune-mediated selection. pvcsp, the
highly variable central repeat region also showed patterns consistent immune
selection, lacking outside repeat. patterns selection seen 
in genes differed p. falciparum orthologs. addition, found 
that, similar merozoite antigens p. falciparum malaria, genetic diversity
of pvmsp-1 sequences showed geographic clustering, non-merozoite
antigen, pvcsp, showed strong geographic clustering. findings suggest 
while immune selection may act vivax vaccine candidate antigens, the
geographic distribution genetic variability differs greatly two 
genes. selective forces driving diversification could lead antigen
escape vaccine failure. better understanding geographic distribution of
genetic variability vaccine candidate antigens key designing and
implementing efficacious vaccines.
