mosquitoes widely despised exasperating buzzing irritating
bites, poignantly because, blood-feeding, females may transmit
pathogens cause devastating diseases. however, ability transmit 
viruses, filarial worms, malaria parasites varies greatly amongst ∼3500
recognised mosquito species. applying omics technologies sample diversity
and explore biology underlying variations bringing increasingly
greater resolution enhances understanding mosquito evolution. we
review current status mosquito omics, 'mozomics', resources recent 
advances applications characterise mosquito biology evolution,
with focus intersection evolutionary functional genomics to
understand putative links gene genome dynamism mosquito
