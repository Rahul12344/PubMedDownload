background: democratic republic congo (drc) bears high burden of
malaria, exacerbated pregnant women. var2csa protein plays a
crucial role pregnancy-associated malaria (pam), hence quantifying
diversity var2csa locus drc important understanding basic
epidemiology pam, developing robust vaccine pam.
methods: samples taken 2013-14 demographic health survey
conducted drc, focusing children 5 years age. short
subregion var2csa gene sequenced 115 spatial clusters, giving
country-wide estimates sequence polymorphism spatial population structure.
results: results indicate var2csa highly polymorphic, diversity 
is maintained balancing selection, however, clear
signal phylogenetic geographic structure diversity. linear
modelling demonstrates number var2csa variants cluster
correlates directly cluster prevalence, epidemiological
factors urbanicity.
conclusions: results suggest drc fits within global pattern high 
var2csa diversity little genetic differentiation regions. broad
multivalent var2csa vaccine candidate could benefit targeting stable regions
and common variants address substantial genetic diversity.
