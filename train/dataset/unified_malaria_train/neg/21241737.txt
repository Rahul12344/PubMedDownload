among several available antimalarial drugs, mefloquine proven effective
against drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum remains drug choice for
both therapy chemoprophylaxis. however, mefloquine known cause adverse 
neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms, offset therapeutic advantage.
the exact mechanisms leading adverse neurological effects mefloquine
are poorly defined. alterations neurotransmitter release calcium
homeostasis, inhibition cholinesterases interaction adenosine
a(2a) receptors hypothesized play prominent roles mediating the
deleterious effects drug. recent data established that
mefloquine also trigger oxidative damage subsequent neurodegeneration 
rat cortical primary neurons. furthermore, utilized system
biology-centered approach constructed pathway model cellular
responses mefloquine, identifying non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (pyk2) a
critical target mediating mefloquine neurotoxicity. study, sought
to establish experimental validation pyk2 using gene-silencing techniques
(sirna). examined whether downregulation pyk2 primary rat
cortical neurons alters mefloquine neurotoxicity evaluating cell viability,
apoptosis oxidative stress. results study confirmed that
mefloquine neurotoxicity associated apoptotic response oxidative
injury, demonstrated mefloquine affects primary rat cortical
neurons, least part, via pyk2. implication findings may prove 
beneficial suppressing neurological side effects mefloquine and
developing effective therapeutic modalities offset adverse effects.
