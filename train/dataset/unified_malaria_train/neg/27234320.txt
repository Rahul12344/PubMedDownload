background: objective study detect plasmodium subspecies 
plasmodium using filter paper malaria endemic province, sanliurfa, turkey, 
compare results nested pcr (npcr) microscopy diagnosis of
malaria present epidemiological data malaria.
methods: study carried malaria-endemic sanliurfa 2008 and
2011. finger prick blood samples, thick thin giemsa-stained blood smears,
were collected 153 malaria-suspected farmworkers. giemsa-stained blood
smears examined microscopically. obtained dna products, extracted from
blood-spotted filter papers thick blood smears, analysed npcr
to amplify 18s ssrrna plasmodium gene genus specific primers. the
results microscopy compared npcr results.
results: specimens, 7.2 % determined plasmodium-positive by
microscopy, whereas 9.8 % determined plasmodium-positive npcr. 
positive plasmodium specimens, 93.33 % identified p. vivax. four of
the 15 specimens microscopically diagnosed negative were
plasmodium-positive npcr. compared microscopy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive values npcr determined 100,
97.2 73.3 %, respectively. npcr determined sensitive and
specific microscopy.
conclusions: study revealed accurate diagnosis malaria npcr
was compulsory malaria-endemic sanliurfa npcr applied routinely 
in laboratory studies.
