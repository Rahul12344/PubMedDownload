malaria major concern international health authorities. millions of
people contract every year world due parasite plasmodium
genus. due complexity parasite biology genetics, is
currently vaccine disease. however, due great resistance
both medicines insecticides used combat disease, 
become essential obtain vaccine necessary tool prevent
transmission eliminate disease. bibliometric data indicate that
interest vaccines growing steadily since 1980s. nowadays, a
powerful tool used: plasmodium genome. allows us improve fight
against disease. knowing sequences genes favor appearance
of drug resistance, encode proteins greater antigenic
response, tool become fundamental. article reviews state
of art vaccines genetics, fight malaria, analyzes
the fixed photo worldwide research disease poses.
