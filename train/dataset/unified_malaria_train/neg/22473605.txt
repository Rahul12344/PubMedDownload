we showed previously ingested human insulin activates insulin/igf-1
signaling pathway anopheles stephensi increases susceptibility of
these mosquitoes plasmodium falciparum. organisms, insulin alter 
immune responsiveness regulation nf-κb transcription factors, critical
elements innate immunity also central mosquito immunity. show 
here insulin signaling decreased expression nf-κb-regulated immune genes 
in mosquito cells stimulated either bacterial malarial soluble products. 
further, human insulin suppressed mosquito immunity sustained
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, since inhibition pathway led to
decreased parasite development mosquito. together, data demonstrate 
that activation insulin/igf-1 signaling pathway ingested human insulin 
can alter nf-κb-dependent immunity, ultimately susceptibility, of
mosquitoes p. falciparum.
