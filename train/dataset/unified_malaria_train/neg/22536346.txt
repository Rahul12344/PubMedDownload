background: recent findings plasmodium african apes changed our
perspectives evolution malarial parasites hominids. however,
phylogenetic analyses primate malarias still missing information from
southeast asian apes. study, report molecular data malaria
parasite lineage found orangutans.
methodology/principal findings: screened twenty-four blood samples pongo 
pygmaeus (kalimantan, indonesia) plasmodium parasites pcr. the
malaria positive orangutan samples, parasite mitochondrial genomes (mtdna) and
two antigens: merozoite surface protein 1 42 kda (msp-1(42)) circumsporozoite
protein gene (csp) amplified, cloned, sequenced. fifteen orangutans
tested positive yielded 5 distinct mitochondrial haplotypes previously
found. haplotypes detected exhibited low genetic divergence among them,
indicating belong one species. report phylogenetic analyses using
mitochondrial genomes, msp-1(42) csp. found orangutan malaria
parasite lineage part monophyletic group includes known
non-human primate malaria parasites found southeast asia; specifically, it
shares recent common ancestor p. inui (a macaque parasite) p. hylobati
(a gibbon parasite) suggesting lineage originated result host
switch. genetic diversity msp-1(42) orangutans seems under
negative selection. result similar previous findings non-human
primate malarias closely related p. vivax. previously observed 
the plasmodium species found non-human primates, csp shows high
polymorphism number repeats. however, clearly distinctive motifs
from previously found malarial parasites.
conclusion: evidence available asian apes indicates parasites
originated independently found africa, likely result host
switches non-human primates.
