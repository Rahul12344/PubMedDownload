the plasmodium vivax prevalent malaria parasite. world
essentially needs malaria vaccine alleviate human suffering associated
with parasitic disease kills one million people annually. 
use plants expression proteins disease-causing vehicle in
transgenic plants increasingly used development experimental
vaccines, largely oriented improvement edible vaccines. currently,
through modern biotechnology, revival obtaining new edible 
vaccine malaria parasite plant sources. genetic
alteration, recognized plants potentially new source of
recombinant proteins including vaccines, antibodies, blood substitutes, other
therapeutic entities. plant-derived antibodies proteins mostly
valuable since free mammalian viral vectors human pathogens.
although significant progress achieved research edible
vaccine plasmodium falciparum, limited progress made the
plasmodium vivax component might eligible edible vaccine development.
we describe overall strategy recommended plants, include high
biomass production low cost cultivation, relatively fast "gene protein"
time, low capital operating costs, outstanding scalability, eukaryotic
posttranslational modifications, relatively high protein yield.
