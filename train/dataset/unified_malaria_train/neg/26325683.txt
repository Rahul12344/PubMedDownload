background: antimalarial drug resistance primary public health problem.
haplotypes pfcrt pfmdr1 gene implicated molecular markers 
of chloroquine (cq) resistance. study aims explore mutation distribution 
of pfcrt pfmdr1 bioko island, equatorial guinea (eg).
methods: blood samples collected different districts bioko. the
single nucleotide polymorphisms pfcrt (codons 72 76) pfmdr1 (codons 86,
130, 184, 1034, 1042, 1109 1246) assessed nested pcr dna
sequencing haplotype prevalences also determined.
results: analysis pfcrt pfmdr1 mutations successful 151 157
samples respectively 172 samples taken study. mutations
of pfcrt pfmdr1 found 98.67% 89.81% isolates, respectively. the
pfcrt 74-76, pfmdr1 86, pfmdr1 184 92.05%, 50.32%, 87.26% found
mostly mutation type, respectively. three haplotypes coding 72-76 pfcrt
were found including cvmnk, cviet, cvm/i n/e k/t, accounted 1.33%, 
92.05%, 6.62%, respectively. mutation pfmdr1-n1 codon 130 and
pfmdr1-n2 (s1034c, n1042d, v1109i, d1246y) detected. types coding 86 
and 184 pfmdr1 found including ny, yy, nf, yf, ny/f yy/f, which
accounted 10.19%, 2.55%, 33.76%, 45.22%, 5.73% 2.55%, respectively.
conclusion: high prevalence pfcrt cviet pfmdr1 86y, 184f double mutations 
confirm high-level cq resistance (cqr) might suggest reduced susceptibility
of plasmodium falciparum isolates aq bioko, eg. establishes fundamental 
data detection p. falciparum cqr molecular markers promotes 
the surveillance level drug resistance bioko, eg.
