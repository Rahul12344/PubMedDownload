amplification pfmdr1 gene associated clinical failures reduced
in vivo vitro sensitivity mefloquine artemether-lumefantrine
in south-east asia. several african countries reported absence very
low prevalence increased copy number, whilst south american reports are
limited peru without venezuela increased pfmdr1 multiplication. the
relative pfmdr1 copy numbers assessed 68 isolates suriname collected
from different endemic villages (2005) mining areas (2009). 11% the
isolates harbour multiple copies pfmdr1 gene. isolates originating from
mining areas yet display higher tendency increased copy number and
no significant differences could registered within time span 4 years, but
the mere presence increased copy number warrants caution be
considered early warning sign emerging drug resistance suriname
