the neural tube primordium central nervous system (cns) which
its development entirely clear. understanding cellular molecular
basis neural tube development could, therefore, provide vital clues the
mechanism neural tube defects (ntds). here, investigated gene
expression profiles three different time points (embryonic day (e) 8.5, 9.5
and 10.5) mouse neural tube using rna-seq approach. 391
differentially expressed genes (degs) screened mouse neural tube
development, including 45 degs involved cns development, among bmp2,
ascl1, olig2, lhx1, wnt7b eomes might play important roles. 45 degs,
foxp2, eomes, hoxb3, gpr56, hap1, nkx2-1, sez6l2, wnt7b, tbx20, nfib, cntn1 and
dcx different isoforms, opposite expression pattern different
isoforms observed gpr56, nkx2-1 sez6l2. addition, alternative
splicing, mutually exclusive exon, retained intron, skipped exon and
alternative 3' splice site identified 10 neural related differentially
splicing genes, including ngrn, ddr1, dctn1, dnmt3b, ect2, map2, mbnl1, meis2,
vcan app. moreover, seven neural splicing factors, nova1/2,
nsr100/srrm4, elavl3/4, celf3 rbfox1 differentially expressed during
mouse neural tube development. interestingly, nine degs identified were
dysregulated retinoic acid-induced ntds model, indicating possible
important role genes ntds. taken together, study provides more
comprehensive information mouse neural tube development, might provide
new insights ntds occurrence. © 2017 iubmb life, 69(9):706-719, 2017.
