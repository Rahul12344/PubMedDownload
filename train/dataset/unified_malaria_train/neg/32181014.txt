though immunity malaria associated cellular immune
responses, exact function phenotypic cell population still unclear.
this study investigated host immune responses elicited the
pre-erythrocytic stage, post-plasmodium yoelii sporozoite infection swiss mice
model. purpose, analyzed dynamics different subsets immune 
cells population cytokine levels hepatic mononuclear splenic cells
population pre-erythrocytic liver-stage infection. observed a
significant reduction effectors immune cells population including cd8+ t
cell, f4/80+ macrophage plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cd11c+ b220+).
interestingly, substantial down-regulation also noted pro-inflammatory
cytokines (i.e. ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-12, il-2, il-17 inos), while, up-regulation 
of anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. il-10, il-4 tgf-β) asymptomatic
pre-erythrocytic liver-stage infection. collectively, study demonstrated
that pre-erythrocytic development, plasmodium yoelii sporozoite impaired
the host activators innate adaptive immune responses regulating the
immune effector cells, gene expression cytokines levels establishment
of infection subsequent development liver spleen. results in
this study provided better understanding events leading malarial
infection helpful supportive treatment vaccine development
strategy.
