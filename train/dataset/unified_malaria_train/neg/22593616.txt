an effective malaria vaccine could prove cost-effective and
efficacious means preventing severe disease death malaria. an
endeavor identify novel vaccine targets, tested predicted plasmodium
falciparum open reading frames proteins elicit parasite-inhibitory abs. 
this led identification cysteine-rich protective ag (cyrpa).
cyrpa cysteine-rich protein harboring predicted signal sequence. the
stage-specific expression cyrpa late schizonts resembles proteins
known involved merozoite invasion. immunofluorescence staining localized
cyrpa apex merozoites. entire protein conserved shown by
sequencing cyrpa encoding gene diverse range p. falciparum
isolates. cyrpa-specific mabs substantially inhibited parasite growth vitro as
well p. falciparum animal model based nod-scid il2rÎ³(null) mice
engrafted human erythrocytes. contrast p. falciparum mouse
models, system generated consistent results evinced dose-response
relationship therefore represents unprecedented vivo model for
quantitative comparison functional potencies malaria-specific abs. 
data suggest role cyrpa erythrocyte invasion merozoite.
inhibition merozoite invasion cyrpa-specific mabs vitro vivo
renders protein promising malaria asexual blood-stage vaccine candidate
ag.
