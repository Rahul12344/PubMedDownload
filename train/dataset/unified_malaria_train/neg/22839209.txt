background: mutations plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt), multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase
(pfdhfr), dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) atpase (pfatp6) genes were
associated anti-malaria drug resistance. aim study to
investigate prevalence polymorphisms pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps 
pfatp6 yunnan province. finger-prick blood samples collected from
malaria-positive patients yunnan province 2009-2010. single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) resistance-related genes analysed various
pcr-based methods.
results: total 108 blood samples collected. although chloroquine has
not used treat falciparum malaria nearly 30 years, 95.3% the
parasites still carried pfcrt k76t mutation, whereas majority isolates
displayed wild-type pfmdr1 n86 d1246 sequences. molecular level of
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance p. falciparum high. most
prevalent mutation pfdhfr c59r (95.9%), whereas frequencies the
quadruple, triple double mutants 22.7% (n51i/c59r/s108n/i164l), 51.5%
(n51i/c59r/s108n, n51i/c59r/i164l c59r/s108n/ i164l) 21.6% (n51i/ c59r,
c59r/s108n c59r/i164l), respectively. a437g (n = 77) k540e (n = 71) 
the prevalent mutations pfdhps, 52.7% samples double
mutants, among a437g/k540e common double mutation (37/49).
quadruple mutants found 28.0% (26/93) samples. total 8.6% of
isolates (8/93) carried s436a/a437g/a581g triple mutation. mutations 
found pfatp6 codons 623 769, another two mutations (n683k r756k)
were found 4.6% (3/97) 9.2% (6/97) parasite isolates, respectively.
conclusions: study identified high frequency mutations pfcrt, pfdhfr
and pfdhps associated cq sp resistance p. falciparum mutations
linked artemisinin resistance (pfatp6). molecular epidemiology be
included routine surveillance protocols used provide complementary
information assess appropriateness current national anti-malarial
drug policy.
