the phylum apicomplexa (alveolates) comprises group host-associated
protists, predominately intracellular parasites, including devastating parasites 
like plasmodium falciparum, causative agent malaria. one more
fascinating characteristics apicomplexa highly reduced (and
occasionally lost) remnant plastid, termed apicoplast. four core metabolic
pathways retained apicoplast: heme synthesis, iron-sulfur cluster
synthesis, isoprenoid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis. suggested 
that one pathways essential plastid plastid genome
retention. past decade witnessed discovery several apicomplexan
relatives, next-generation sequencing efforts revealing retain 
variable plastid metabolic capacities. data providing clues the
core genes pathways reduced plastids, time further
confounding view evolutionary history apicoplast. here, we
examine evolutionary history apicoplast, explore plastid metabolism in
apicomplexa close relatives, propose differences among
reduced plastids result game endosymbiotic roulette. continued
exploration apicomplexa relatives sure provide new
insights evolution apicoplast apicomplexans whole.
