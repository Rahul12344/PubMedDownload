background: anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria one world's
most threatening diseases. anopheles dirus (sensu stricto) among main
vectors malaria south east asia. mosquito innate immune response the
first line defence malaria parasites development. the
immune deficiency (imd) pathway, conserved immune signaling pathway, influences
anti-plasmodium falciparum activity anopheles gambiae, an. stephensi an.
albimanus. aim study determine role rel2, imd
pathway-controlled nf-kappaβ transcription factor, an. dirus.
methods: race (rapid amplification cdna ends) performed rel2 gene. 
double-stranded rel2 constructed injected thorax female
mosquitoes. injected mosquitoes fed p. falciparum gametocyte
culture dissected day 7-9 post-feeding order count oocysts. a
survival analysis conducted exposing dsrna injected mosquitoes to
gram-positive gram-negative bacteria.
results: study demonstrated rel2 gene an. dirus two
isoforms, short length full length. rna interference-mediated gene silencing 
of rel2 showed latter involved protection p. falciparum,
gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus) lys-type peptidoglycan and
gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli) dap-type peptidoglycan.
conclusion: study suggested similarities splicing
events functionality rel2 gene, anopheles species. among
all important anophelines, immunity thoroughly
investigated. order develop novel vector-based control strategies and
restrict malaria transmission, immune pathways important vectors
should thoroughly investigated.
