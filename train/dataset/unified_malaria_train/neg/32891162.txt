background: vector control bacillus sphaericus (bs) effective way to
block transmission malaria. however, practical application bs
agents, sublethal dose effect often caused insufficient dosing, it
is little known whether bs exposure would affect surviving mosquitoes'
vector capacity malaria.
methods: sublethal dose bs 2362 strain administrated early
fourth-instar larvae anopheles dirus simulate shortage use bs field
circumstance. determine vector competence, mosquitoes dissected the
oocysts midguts examined day 9-11 post-infection plasmodium
yoelii. meanwhile, sybr quantitative pcr assay conducted examine the
transcriptional level key immune molecules mosquitoes, rna
interference utilized validate role key immune effector molecule
tep1.
results: sublethal dose bs treatment significantly reduced susceptibility 
of an. dirus p. yoelii, decrease p. yoelii infection intensity and
rate. although existed melanization response adult an. dirus following
challenge p. yoelii, involved decrease vector
competence significant difference melanization rates densities
between control bs groups found. studies showed bs
treatment significantly increased tep1 expression fourth-instar larvae
(l4), pupae (pu), 48 h post-infection (hpi) 72 hpi (p < 0.001). further,
gene-silencing tep1 resulted disappearance bs impact vector
competence an. dirus p. yoelii. moreover, transcriptional level of
pgrp-lc rel2 significantly elevated bs treatment decreased
expression negative regulator caspar 48 hpi, implied imd
signaling pathway upregulated bs exposure.
conclusions: bs exposure reduce vector competence an. dirus malaria
parasites upregulating imd signaling pathway enhancing expression
of tep1. data could help us understand impact mechanism
of bs exposure anopheles' vector competence malaria also provide us
with novel clues wiping malaria using vector control.
