chemotherapy critical component malaria control. however, deadly
malaria pathogen, plasmodium falciparum, repeatedly mounted resistance
against series antimalarial drugs used last decades. southeast asia
is epicenter emerging antimalarial drug resistance, including recent
resistance artemisinins, core component recommended
antimalarial combination therapies. alterations parasitic membrane
proteins pgh-1, pfcrt pfmrp1 believed major contributors to
resistance decreasing intracellular drug accumulation. pfcrt, pfmdr1 
and pfmrp1 genes sequenced set p.falciparum field isolates from
the thai-myanmar border. vitro drug susceptibility artemisinin,
dihydroartemisinin, mefloquine lumefantrine assessed. positive
correlations seen vitro susceptibility responses to
artemisinin dihydroartemisinin responses arylamino-alcohol
quinolines lumefantrine mefloquine. previously unstudied pfmdr1 f1226y
and pfmrp1 f1390i snps associated significantly artemisinin, mefloquine
and lumefantrine vitro susceptibility. variation pfmdr1 gene copy number 
was also associated parasite drug susceptibility artemisinin, mefloquine 
and lumefantrine. work unveils new candidate markers p. falciparum
multidrug resistance vitro, contributing understanding of
subjacent genetic complexity, essential future evidence-based drug policy
decisions.
