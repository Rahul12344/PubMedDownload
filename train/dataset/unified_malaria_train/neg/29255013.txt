the spread blood-borne pathogens mosquitoes relies taking blood 
meal; bite, disease transmission. although many
species mosquitoes never take blood meal, identifying genes distinguish
blood feeding obligate nonbiting hampered fact these
different lifestyles occur separate, genetically incompatible species. there
is, however, one unique extant species populations share common
genetic background blood feed one region obligate nonbiters the
rest range: wyeomyia smithii contemporary blood-feeding obligate
nonbiting populations represent end points divergence fully
interfertile southern northern populations. divergence undoubtedly
resulted genetic changes unrelated blood feeding, the
challenge winnow unrelated genetic factors identify those
related specifically evolutionary transition blood feeding to
obligate nonbiting. herein, determine differential gene expression resulting
from directional selection blood feeding within polymorphic population to
isolate genetic differences blood feeding obligate nonbiting. show
that evolution nonbiting resulted greatly reduced metabolic
investment compared biting populations, greater reliance opportunistic 
metabolic pathways, greater reliance visual rather olfactory sensory 
input. w. smithii provides unique starting point determine are
universal nonbiting genes mosquitoes could manipulated means to
control vector-borne disease.
