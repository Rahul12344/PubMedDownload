background: assess effect malaria prevalence, village specific monthly 
administrations pyrimethamine, chlorproguanil, chloroquine placebo were
given children four previously treatment-naïve liberian villages, 1976-78. 
plasmodium falciparum vivo resistance developed pyrimethamine only.
selection molecular markers p. falciparum resistance 2 years of
treatment reported.
methods: blood samples collected 191 study children survey in
1978. polymorphisms pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmrp1 pfnhe1 genes
were determined using pcr-based methods.
results: pfcrt 72-76 cviet found one chloroquine village sample, all
remaining samples pfcrt cvmnk. pfmdr1 n86 prevalence 100%. pfmdr1
t1069act→acg synonymous polymorphism found 30% chloroquine village
samples 3% samples (p = 0.008). variations pfnhe1 block were
found except chloroquine treated village (p < 0.001). resistance
associated pfdhfr 108n prevalence 2% pyrimethamine village compared to
45-65% elsewhere, including placebo village (p = 0.001).
conclusions: chloroquine treatment possibly resulted development pfcrt 
72-76 cviet. selection pfmdr1 t1069acg pfnhe1 block 1 genotypes
indicates chloroquine treatment exerted selective pressure p.
falciparum. pyrimethamine resistance associated pfdhfr 108n present prior 
the introduction drug. decreased pfdhfr 108n frequency concurrent with
development pyrimethamine resistance suggests non-pfdhfr polymorphisms
mediated resistance mechanism.
