bacillus thuringiensis well-known biopesticide used more
than 80 years. spore-forming bacterium belongs group bacillus
cereus also includes, among others, emetic diarrheic pathotypes b.
cereus, animal pathogen bacillus anthracis psychrotolerant bacillus
weihenstephanensis. bacillus thuringiensis rather unique since adapted 
its lifestyle efficient pathogen specific insect larvae. one the
peculiarities b. thuringiensis strains extent extrachromosomal
pool, strains harbouring 10 distinct plasmid molecules. among 
numerous serovars b. thuringiensis, 'israelensis' certainly emblematic
since host spectrum apparently restricted dipteran insects like
mosquitoes black flies, vectors human animal diseases malaria,
yellow fever, river blindness. review, putative role mobile
gene pool b. thuringiensis serovar israelensis pathogenicity and
dedicated lifestyle reviewed, specific emphasis nature, diversity,
and potential mobility constituents. variations among related
strains b. thuringiensis serovar israelensis also reported and
discussed scope specialised insect pathogen, whose lifestyle in
the environment remains largely unknown.
