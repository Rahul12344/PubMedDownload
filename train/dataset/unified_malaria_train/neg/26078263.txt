complete dosage compensation refers hyperexpression entire x z
chromosome organisms heterogametic sex chromosomes (xy male zw female)
in order compensate one copy x z chromosome. recent 
analyses suggest complete dosage compensation, drosophila
melanogaster, may norm. systematic study focusing on
dosage compensation mosquitoes. however, analysis dosage compensation in
anopheles mosquitoes provides opportunities evolutionary insights, x
chromosome anopheles dipteran relative, d. melanogaster formed
independently ancestral chromosome. furthermore, culicinae
mosquitoes, including aedes genus, homomorphic sex-determining
chromosomes, negating need dosage compensation. thus, culicinae genes
provide rare phylogenetic context investigate dosage compensation in
anopheles mosquitoes. here, performed rna-seq analysis male female
samples asian malaria mosquito anopheles stephensi yellow fever
mosquito aedes aegypti. autosomal x-linked genes an. stephensi showed very
similar levels expression males females, indicating complete
dosage compensation. uniformity average expression levels autosomal and
x-linked genes remained an. stephensi gene expression normalized that
of ae. aegypti orthologs, strengthening finding complete dosage
compensation anopheles. addition, comparatively analyzed the
differentially expressed genes adult males adult females both
species, investigated sex-biased gene chromosomal distribution patterns an.
stephensi provided three examples gene duplications may enabled
the acquisition sex-specific expression mosquito evolution.
