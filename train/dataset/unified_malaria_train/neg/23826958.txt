malaria continues devastating disease. investigated factors that
control intraerythrocytic development parasite plasmodium falciparum by
using chemically defined medium (cdm) containing non-esterified fatty acid(s)
(nefa) phospholipids specific fatty acid moieties, identify
substances crucial parasite development. different nefas cdm played
distinct roles altering development parasite various stages,
with effects ranging complete growth growth arrest ring stage. 
used genome-wide transcriptome profiling identify genes were
differentially expressed among different developmental stages the
parasite, cultured presence various nefas. predicted 26 transcripts 
that associated suppression schizogony, 5 transcripts, 
including merozoite surface protein 2, putative dead/deah box rna helicase,
serine repeat antigen 3, putative copper channel, palmitoyl
acyltransferase, particularly associated blockage trophozoite
progression ring stage. furthermore, involvement copper ions in
developmental arrest detected copper-ion-chelating methods, implying a
critical function copper homeostasis early growth stage the
parasite. results help elucidate mechanisms behind the
development p. falciparum.
