background: insecticides still core insect pest vector control 
programmes. several lines evidence indicate abc transporters involved
in detoxification processes insecticides, including permethrin 
pyrethroids. particular, abcg4 gene, member g subfamily, has
consistently shown up-regulated response insecticide treatments 
in mosquito malaria vector anopheles stephensi (both adults larvae).
methods: verify actual involvement transmembrane protein the
detoxification process permethrin, bioassays larvae an. stephensi,
combining insecticide sirna, specifically designed inhibition 
of abcg4 gene expression performed. administration larvae same
sirna, labeled fluorescent molecule, effected investigate the
systemic distribution inhibitory rna larval bodies. based on
sirna results, similar experiments using antisense vivo-morpholinos (vivo-mos)
were effected. molecules, compared sirna, expected guarantee a
higher stability environmental conditions insect gut, present
thus higher potential future in-field applications.
results: bioassays using two different concentrations sirna, associated with
permethrin, led increase larval mortality, compared results with
permethrin alone. outcomes confirm abcg4 transporter plays role in
the detoxification process selected insecticide. moreover, after
fluorescent labelling, shown systemic dissemination sirna in
different body districts an. stephensi larvae, suggest potential
systemic effect molecule. time, results vivo-mo experiments
were congruent obtained using sirna, thus confirming potential 
abcg4 inhibition strategy increase permethrin susceptibility in
mosquitoes. first time, vivo-mos administered water larvae,
with evidence biological effect.
conclusions: targeting abcg4 gene silencing techniques resulted 
in increased pyrethroid efficacy. results open way toward the
possibility exploit abcg4 inhibition context integrated programmes
for control an. stephensi mosquitoes malaria transmission.
