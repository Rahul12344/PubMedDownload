sexual development integral transmission plasmodium parasites
between vertebrates mosquitos. recent years seen great advances in
understanding gene expression underlies commitment asexual parasites 
to differentiate sexual gametocyte stages, mature form
gametes inside mosquito. less well understood parasites
differentially control development become males females. plasmodium
parasites haploid time sexual differentiation, clonal haploid
line produce male female gametocytes, presumably lack the
sex-determining alleles present eukaryotes. though molecular
switch initiate male female development remains hidden, recent studies
reveal regulatory proteins needed sex-specific maturation male and
female gametocytes. yuda collaborators report characterization a
transcription factor necessary female gametocyte maturation. renewed
attention malaria elimination, sex increasing focus because
transmission-blocking strategies likely important component of
elimination efforts.
