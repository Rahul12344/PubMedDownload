historically seen benign disease, becoming clear plasmodium
vivax cause significant morbidity. effective control strategies targeting p. 
vivax malaria hindered limited understanding vivax biology. 
established p. vivax transcriptome intraerythrocytic developmental
cycle (idc) two clinical isolates high resolution illumina hiseq
platform. detailed map transcriptome generates new insights into
regulatory mechanisms individual genes reveals intimate relationship
with specific biological functions. transcriptional hotspot vir genes
observed chromosome 2 suggests potential active site modulating immune
evasion plasmodium parasite across patients. compared eukaryotes,
p. vivax genes tend unusually long 5' untranslated regions also
present multiple transcription start sites. contrast, alternative splicing 
rare p. vivax association late schizont stage suggests some
of significance gene function. newly identified transcripts,
including 179 vir like genes 3018 noncoding rnas suggest important
role gene/transcript classes strain specific transcriptional
regulation.
