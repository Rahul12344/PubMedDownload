background: bloodstream malaria parasites require ca++ development, but
the sites mechanisms ca++ utilization well understood. we
hypothesized may differences ca++ uptake utilization by
genetically distinct lines p. falciparum. differences, identified,
may provide insights molecular mechanisms.
results: dose response studies ca++ chelator egta (ethylene
glycol-bis(Î²-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid) revealed stable
differences ca++ requirement six geographically divergent parasite lines
used previous genetic crosses, largest difference seen the
parents hb3 x dd2 cross. genetic mapping ca++ requirement yielded
complex inheritance 34 progeny clones single significant locus on
chromosome 7 possible contributions loci. although encoded a
gene significant locus proposed ca++ target, pfcrt (p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter), primary determinant clinical
resistance antimalarial drug chloroquine, appear contribute to
this quantitative trait. stage-specific application extracellular egta also
excluded determinants associated merozoite egress erythrocyte
reinvasion.
conclusions: identified differences ca++ utilization amongst p.
falciparum lines. differences genetic regulation, segregating 
a complex trait genetic cross progeny. ca++ uptake utilization throughout 
the bloodstream asexual cycle malaria parasites represents unexplored
target therapeutic intervention.
