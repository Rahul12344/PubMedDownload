most eukaryotic organisms including protozoans like crithidia, leishmania, and
plasmodium encode repertoire equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ents).
using genomic sequencing data crithidia fasciculata, discovered this
organism contains multiple ent genes highly similar sequence previously
cloned characterized adenosine transporter cfnt1: cfat1 cfnt3, an
allele cfat1, named cfat1.2. characterization cfat1 shows an
adenosine-only transporter, 87% identical cfnt1 protein sequence, a
50-fold lower km adenosine. site directed mutation key residue in
transmembrane domain 4 (tm4) cfnt1 cfat1 shows lysine this
position results high affinity phenotype, threonine decreases
adenosine affinity transporters. results show c. fasciculata
has least two adenosine transporters, protozoan ents, a
lysine residue tm4 plays key role ligand affinity.
