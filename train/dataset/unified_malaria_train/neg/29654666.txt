pathogens one main forces driving evolution maintenance the
highly polymorphic genes vertebrate major histocompatibility complex
(mhc). although mhc proteins crucial pathogen recognition, still
poorly understood pathogen-mediated selection promotes maintains mhc
diversity, especially host species highly duplicated mhc genes.
sedge warblers (acrocephalus schoenobaenus) highly duplicated mhc genes, and
using data high-throughput mhc genotyping, able investigate to
what extent avian malaria parasites explain temporal mhc class supertype
fluctuations long-term study population. investigated infection status
and infection intensities two different strains haemoproteus, avian
malaria parasites known significant fitness consequences in
sedge warblers. found prevalence avian malaria carriers specific
mhc class supertypes significant predictor frequency changes
between years. finding suggests avian malaria infections partly drive
the temporal fluctuations mhc class supertypes. furthermore, found
that individuals large number different supertypes higher
resistance avian malaria, evidence optimal mhc class i
diversity. thus, two studied malaria parasite strains appear select 
high mhc class supertype diversity. selection may explain maintenance 
of extremely high number mhc class gene copies sedge warblers and
possibly also passerines avian malaria common disease.
