many bacterial, viral parasitic pathogens undergo antigenic variation to
counter host immune defense mechanisms. plasmodium falciparum, lethal
of human malaria parasites, switching var gene expression results in
alternating expression adhesion proteins plasmodium
falciparum-erythrocyte membrane protein 1 class infected erythrocyte
surface. recombination clearly generates var diversity, nature and
control genetic exchanges involved remain unclear. experimental and
bioinformatic identification recombination events genome-wide
recombination hotspots var genes, show parasite's sexual
stages, ectopic recombination isogenous var paralogs occurs near low
folding free energy dna 50-mers sequences heavily concentrated
at boundaries regions encoding individual plasmodium
falciparum-erythrocyte membrane protein 1 structural domains. recombinogenic 
potential 50-mers parasite-specific sequences also 
induce recombination transferred yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
genetic cross data suggest dna secondary structures (dss) act inducers of
recombination dna replication p. falciparum sexual stages, that
these dss-regulated genetic exchanges generate functional diverse p.
falciparum adhesion antigens. dss-induced recombination may represent common
mechanism optimizing evolvability virulence gene families in
pathogens.
