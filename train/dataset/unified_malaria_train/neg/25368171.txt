female insects generally mate multiple times lives. notable
exception female malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae, sex loses
her susceptibility copulation. sex species also renders
females competent lay eggs developed blood feeding. despite intense
research efforts, identity molecular triggers cause the
postmating switch females, inducing permanent refractoriness further
mating triggering egg-laying, remains elusive. show the
male-transferred steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20e) key regulator of
monandry oviposition an. gambiae. sexual transfer 20e impaired 
by partial inactivation hormone inhibition biosynthesis in
males, oviposition refractoriness mating female are
strongly reduced. conversely, mimicking sexual delivery injecting 20e into
virgin females switches artificial mated status, triggering egg-laying
and reducing susceptibility copulation. sexual transfer 20e appears to
incapacitate females physically receiving seminal fluids second male.
comparative analysis microarray data females mating 20e
treatment indicates 20e-regulated molecular pathways likely implicated
in postmating switch, including cytoskeleton musculature-associated genes
that may render atrium impenetrable additional mates. revealing signals
and pathways shaping key processes an. gambiae reproductive biology, our
data offer new opportunities control natural populations malaria
