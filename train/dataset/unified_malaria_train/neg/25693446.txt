malaria mosquito-borne disease caused plasmodium parasite. the
four plasmodium species routinely cause human malaria, plasmodium vivax is
the widespread species outside africa, causing ∼18.9 million cases 2012. 
p. vivax cannot cultured continuously vitro, severely hampers
research nonendemic endemic countries alike. consequently, whole-genome
sequencing become effective means interrogate biology p.
vivax parasite. comparative genomic analysis five p. vivax reference
genomes several whole-genome sequences closely related monkey malaria 
species p. cynomolgi revealed extraordinary level genetic diversity and
enabled characterization novel multigene families important single-copy
genes. generation whole-genome sequences multiple clinical isolates
is also driving forward knowledge concerning biology evolution the
species. understanding biology p. vivax crucial develop potential
antimalarial drugs vaccines achieve goal eliminating malaria.
