salmonella enterica infection major public health concern worldwide,
particularly associated medical conditions. serovars
typhimurium enteritidis frequently associated invasive illness
that primarily affects immunocompromised adults children hiv, malaria,
or malnutrition. serovars also cause infections variety animal 
hosts, common isolates poultry materials. here, we
described s. enteritidis mutants, hupa hupb genes deleted, and
evaluated potential use live-attenuated vaccine candidates. vitro,
the mutants behaved like s. typhimurium described previously, some
particularities macrophage invasion survival experiments. virulence
and immunogenicity mutant lacking hupa hupb (pt4δhupab) were
evaluated balb/c mice model. mutant highly attenuated could,
therefore, administrated doses higher 109 cfu/treatment, was
sufficient protect treated mice challenged wild-type parental
strain single dose. additionally, pt4δhupab strain induced production 
of specific igg iga antibodies salmonella th1-related cytokines
(ifn-γ tnf-α), indicating strain induce systemic mucosal
protection murine model. additional studies needed better
understand mechanisms lead attenuation double-mutant pt4δhupab
and elucidate immune response induced immunization using strain.
however, data allow us state hupab mutants could potential
candidates explore live-attenuated vaccines.
