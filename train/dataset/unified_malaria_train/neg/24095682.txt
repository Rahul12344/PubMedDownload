background: computational identification apicoplast-targeted proteins is
important drug target determination diseases malaria. 
are established methods identifying proteins bipartite signal in
multiple species apicomplexa, apicoplast-targeted proteins possess
this bipartite signature. publication recent experimental findings of
apicoplast membrane proteins, called transmembrane proteins, possess 
a bipartite signal made feasible devise machine learning approach for
identifying new class apicoplast-targeted proteins computationally.
methodology/principal findings: work, develop method predicting 
apicoplast-targeted transmembrane proteins multiple species apicomplexa,
whereby several classifiers trained different feature sets based on
different algorithms evaluated combined ensemble classification
model obtain best expected performance. feature sets considered are
the hydrophobicity composition characteristics amino acids over
transmembrane domains, existence short sequence motifs cytosolically 
disposed regions, gene ontology (go) terms associated given proteins.
our model, apicoamp, ensemble classification model combines decisions 
of classifiers following majority vote principle. apicoamp trained a
set proteins 11 apicomplexan species achieves 91% overall expected
accuracy.
conclusions/significance: apicoamp first computational model capable of
identifying apicoplast-targeted transmembrane proteins apicomplexa. the
apicoamp prediction software available http://code.google.com/p/apicoamp/
and http://bcb.eecs.wsu.edu.
