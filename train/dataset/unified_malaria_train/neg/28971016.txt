avian haemosporidia reported various birds japan, part
of east asian-australian flyway important stopover site for
migratory birds potentially carrying new pathogens areas. we
investigated prevalence avian malaria injured wild birds, rescued in
tokyo surrounding areas. also evaluated effects migration by
examining prevalence avian malaria migratory status. 475 birds of
80 species sampled four facilities. samples examined for
haemosporidian infection via nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) the
cytochrome b (cytb) gene. 100 birds (21.1%) 43 species pcr positive for
avian haemosporidia. prevalence wintering birds, migratory breeders, and
resident birds 46.0%, 19.3%, 17.3% respectively. bias in
wintering birds due eurasian coot (fulica atra) anseriformes. wintering
birds, lineages likely transmitted culiseta sp. northern
japan lineages resident species northern japan continental asia
were found, suggesting wintering birds mainly infected breeding
sites. meanwhile, numerous lineages found resident migratory 
breeders, suggesting transmitted japan, possibly unique 
japan. although limits studying rescued birds, rehabilitation
facilities make sampling difficult-to-catch migratory species possible and
also allow long-term monitoring within areas.
