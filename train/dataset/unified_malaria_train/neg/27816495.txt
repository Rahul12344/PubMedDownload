the significant strides made reducing global malaria burden past
decades threatened emergence multi-drug resistant malaria.
mechanisms resistance several classes antimalarial drugs been
linked key mutations plasmodium falciparum genes. pyrimethamine targets
the dihydrofolate reductase bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase
thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts), specific point mutations dhfr-ts gene 
have assigned resistant phenotypes. several molecular methods are
available detect mutant genotypes including dna sequencing pcr-based
methods. study, report development pfsnp-lamp detect
nucleotide polymorphism dhfr gene associated n51i mutation and
antifolate resistance. pfsnp-lamp method validated genomic dna
samples parasite lysates prepared sensitive pyrimethamine resistant 
strains p. falciparum.
