naturally acquired antibodies proteins expressed plasmodium falciparum 
parasitized red blood cell (prbc) surface steer course malaria infection
by reducing sequestration stimulating phagocytosis prbc. have
studied selection proteins representing three different parasite gene
families employing well-characterized parasite severe malaria phenotype 
(fcr3s1.2). presence naturally acquired antibodies, impact rosetting
rate, surface reactivity opsonization phagocytosis relation to
different blood groups abo system assessed set sera from
children mild complicated malaria endemic area. show 
naturally acquired immune responses, developed malaria natural infection, 
have limited access prbcs inside blood group rosette. data also
indicate surfin4.2 may function prbc surface, particularly
during rosette formation, role however needs validated. our
results also indicate epitopes differentially recognized rosette-disrupting
antibodies peptide array. antibodies towards parasite-derived proteins 
as pfemp1, rifin surfin combination host factors, essentially abo
blood group malaria patient, suggested determine outcome a
malaria infection.
