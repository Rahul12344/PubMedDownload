due challenges control, prevention, eradication parasitic
diseases like malaria, urgent need discover new therapeutic
agents. plant-derived medicines may open new ways field antiplasmodial 
therapy. study aimed investigate toxicity vivo
antiplasmodial activity apigenin, dietary flavonoid. apigenin cytotoxicity
was investigated huh7 cell line, brine shrimp (artemia salina) larva, and
human red blood cells. vivo toxicity apigenin assessed metabolomics 
approaches. apigenin exhibited significant suppression parasitemia a
dose-dependent manner; suppressed plasmodium berghei growth 69.74%, 50.3%, 
and 49.23% concentrations 70, 35, 15 mg/kg/day, respectively. ic50 
value apigenin 24 hr exposure huh7 cells 225 μg/ml. apigenin did
not show noticeable toxicity a. salina also membrane integrity of
red blood cells. 24 hr exposure mice apigenin, alterations seen 
in metabolism glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids, bile acid metabolism
(alternative pathway), sulfur metabolism, bile acid metabolism, metabolism of
estrogens androgens, cholesterol catabolism, biosynthesis cholesterol.
these findings indicate apigenin potential vivo antiplasmodial
activity p. berghei infected mice high selectivity malaria, 
but disrupt metabolic pathways mice.
