malaria, disease caused plasmodium parasites, widespread throughout
tropical sub-tropical regions worldwide; mostly affects children and
pregnant woman. eradication stalled despite effective prevention measures and
medication available disease; mainly due the
parasite's resistance medical treatment mosquito vector's resistance
to insecticides. tackling resistance involves using renewed approaches and
techniques accruing deep understanding parasite's biology, and
developing new drugs vaccines. studying parasite's invasion of
erythrocytes shed light ability switch invasion
phenotypes related expression gene sets encoding proteins acting as
ligands target cell invasion, thereby conferring mechanisms evading 
particular host's immune response adapting changes target cell surface 
receptors. review considers factors influencing expression 
phenotypes, plasmodium's genetic, transcriptional epigenetic
characteristics, explores host-related aspects could affect
parasite phenotypes, aiming integrating knowledge regarding topic the
possible relationship parasite's biology host factors playing a
role erythrocyte invasion.
