vaccination great success combating diseases, especially infectious
diseases. however, traditional vaccination strategies ineffective several
life-threatening diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids),
tuberculosis, malaria, cancer. viral vaccine vectors represent promising
strategy efficiently deliver foreign genes enhance antigen
presentation vivo. however, several limitations, including pre-existing
immunity packaging capacity, block application viral vectors.
cytomegalovirus (cmv) demonstrated new type viral vector with
additional advantages. cmv could systematically elicit maintain high
frequencies effector memory cells "memory inflation" mechanism. 
studies shown cmv genetically modified induce distinct
patterns cd8+ t-cell responses, unconventional cd8+ t-cell
responses rarely induced conventional vaccine strategies. cmv has
been used vaccine vector deliver many disease-specific antigens, 
efficacy vaccines tested different animal models. promising
results demonstrated robust unconventional t-cell responses elicited
by cmv-based vaccine vector essential control diseases. these
accumulated data evidence strongly suggest cmv-based vaccine vector
represents promising approach develop novel prophylactic therapeutic
vaccines epidemic pathogens tumors.
