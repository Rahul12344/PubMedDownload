background: malaria caused plasmodium spp. still major threat public
health globally. various approaches developing new antimalarial agents
rely understanding complex regulatory mechanisms dynamic gene
expression life-cycle malaria parasites. nuclear members of
the evolutionarily conserved actin-related protein nuclear (arp) superfamily 
the major components nucleosome remodelling complexes. human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, bioinformatics analysis predicted three arp
orthologues: pfarp1, pfarp4 pfarp6. however, little known the
biological functions putative pfarp4. study, aimed investigate
the function underlying mechanisms pfarp4 gene regulation.
methods: conditional gene knockdown approach adopted incorporating the
glucosamine-inducible glms ribozyme sequence 3' utr pfarp4 and
pfarp6 genes. transgenic parasites pfarp4-ty1-ribo, pfarp6-ty1-ribo and
pl6-pfarp4-ty1::pfarp6-ha generated crispr-cas9 technique. the
knockdown effect transgenic parasite measured growth curve assay
and western blot (wb) analysis. direct interaction pfarp4 pfarp6 
was validated co-ifa co-ip assays. euchromatic gene expression
mediated h2a.z (histone h2a variant) deposition h3k9ac modification
at promoters regulated pfarp4, determined rna-seq chip-seq.
results: inducible knockdown pfarp4 inhibited blood-stage development of
p. falciparum. pfarp4 pfarp6 colocalized nucleus p. falciparum
parasites. pfarp4 gene knockdown altered global transcriptome. pfarp4 protein
colocalized histone variant h2a.z euchromatic marker h3k9ac in
intergenic regions. inducible downregulation pfarp4 resulted the
depletion h2a.z lower h3k9ac levels upstream regions eukaryotic 
genes, thereby repressing transcriptional abundance h2a.z-dependent genes.
conclusions: findings suggest pfarp4 regulates cell cycle by
controlling h2a.z deposition affecting centromere function, contributing to
the understanding complex epigenetic regulation gene expression the
development p. falciparum.
