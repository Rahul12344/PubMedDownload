inherited hemoglobin disorders like alpha thalassemia sickle gene common 
in indian subcontinent. disorders heterozygous state act as
malaria resistance genes influence susceptibility plasmodium
falciparum malaria. inadequate knowledge epidemiology these
malaria resistance genes tribal dominated malaria endemic region the
state odisha eastern india. cross sectional prevalence study was
undertaken 594 subjects five tribal populations region, namely,
sahara (42.4%), kutia kandha (30.0%), kuda (15.8%), gond (9.8%), oraon
(2.0%). sickling test, hb electrophoresis, hplc, molecular studies were
undertaken diagnose prevalence sickle allele, β -thalassemia allele,
and deletional alpha thalassemia. sickle β thalassemia alleles found 
13.1% 3.4% subjects, respectively. sickle allele found in
heterozygous (10.1%) homozygous state (3.03%). prevalence alpha
thalassemia 50.84% allelic frequency 0.37. α (-3.7) α
(-4.2) alpha thalassemia detected allele frequency 0.33 0.04,
respectively. high prevalence alpha thalassemia sickle gene this
population probably due selection pressure endemic malaria part 
of india.
