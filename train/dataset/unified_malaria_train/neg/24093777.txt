background: tight junction (tj) one important structures
established merozoite invasion host cells large amount of
proteins stored toxoplasma plasmodium parasites' apical organelles are
involved forming tj. plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii apical
membrane antigen 1 (ama-1) rhoptry neck proteins (rons) two main tj
components. shown ron4 plays essential role merozoite 
and sporozoite invasion target cells. study focused characterizing
a novel plasmodium vivax rhoptry protein, ron4, homologous pfron4 and
pkron4.
methods: ron4 gene re-annotated p. vivax genome using various
bioinformatics tools taking pfron4 pkron4 amino acid sequences as
templates. gene synteny, well identity similarity values open
reading frames (orfs) belonging three species assessed. gene
transcription pvron4, expression localization encoded
protein also determined vcg-1 strain molecular immunological
studies. nucleotide amino acid sequences obtained pvron4 vcg-1 were
compared strains coming different geographical areas.
results: pvron4 733 amino acid long protein, encoded three
exons, similar transcription translation patterns reported
for homologue, pfron4. sequencing pvron4 vcg-1 strain comparing 
it p. vivax strains different geographical locations shown two
conserved regions separated low complexity variable region, possibly acting 
as "smokescreen". pvron4 contains predicted signal sequence, coiled-coil
α-helical motif, two tandem repeats six conserved cysteines towards the
carboxy-terminus soluble protein lacking predicted transmembranal
domains gpi anchor. indirect immunofluorescence assays shown that
pvron4 expressed apical end schizonts co-localizes the
rhoptry neck pvron2.
conclusions: genomic, transcriptional expression data reported pvron4, as
well primary structure characteristics suggest protein
participates reticulocyte invasion, shown homologue
pfron4.
