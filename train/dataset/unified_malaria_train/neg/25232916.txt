herein demonstrate use wearable device selectively capture
two distinct circulating protein biomarkers (recombinant p. falciparum rpfhrp2
and total igg) intradermal fluid live mice situ, subsequent
detection vitro. device comprises microprojection array that, when
applied skin, penetrates outer skin layers interface directly 
intradermal fluid. complexity biological fluid being
sampled, investigated effects solution conditions attachment 
capture antibodies, optimize assay detection limit vitro on
live mice. detection target antigen diluted 20% serum,
immobilization conditions favoring high antibody surface density (low ph, low
ionic strength) resulted 100-fold greater sensitivity comparison to
standard conditions, yielding detection limit equivalent plate
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). also show blocking device 
surface reduce nonspecific adsorption target analyte host proteins does
not significantly change sensitivity. injecting mice rpfhrp2 via the
tail vein, compared analyte levels plasma skin biopsies
(cross-sectional area microprojection array), observing skin
samples contained equivalent ∼8 μl analyte-containing plasma. then
applied arrays mice, showing surfaces coated high density of
antibodies captured significant amount rpfhrp2 target standard
surface showed capture comparison negative control. next, applied
a triplex device control rpfhrp2-treated mice, simultaneously
capturing rpfhrp2 total igg (as positive control skin penetration) in
comparison negative control device. conclude devices be
used capture clinically relevant, circulating protein biomarkers infectious
disease via skin, potential applications minimally invasive and
lab-free biomarker detection platform.
