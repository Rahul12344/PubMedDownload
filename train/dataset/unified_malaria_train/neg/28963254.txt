the mosquito's innate immune system controls plasmodium bacterial
infections. investigated competitiveness mosquitoes genetically
modified alter expression anti-plasmodium immune genes a
mixed-cage population wild-type mosquitoes. observed genetically
modified mosquitoes increased immune activity midgut tissue not
have observed fitness disadvantage showed reduced microbial loads 
the midgut reproductive organs. changes result mating preference
of genetically modified males wild-type females, whereas wild-type males
prefer genetically modified females. changes foster spread the
genetic modification mosquito cage population.
