background: human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum evolved complex 
drug evasion mechanisms available antimalarials. date, combination 
of amodiaquine-artesunate among drug choice treatment of
uncomplicated malaria. combination, short acting, artesunate is
partnered long acting, amodiaquine resistance may emerge rapidly
especially high transmission settings. here, used rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei anka surrogate p. falciparum investigate the
mechanisms amodiaquine resistance. methods: used serial technique select
amodiaquine resistance submitting parasites continuous amodiaquine
pressure. employed 4-day suppressive test monitor emergence of
resistance determine cross-resistance profiles. finally, genotyped the
resistant parasite pcr amplification, sequencing relative quantitation 
mrna transcript targeted genes. results: submission p. berghei anka to
amodiaquine pressure yielded resistant parasite within thirty-six passages. the
effective dosage reduced 90% parasitaemia (ed 90) sensitive line and
resistant line 4.29mg/kg 19.13mg/kg, respectively. freezing at
-80Âºc one month, resistant parasite remained stable ed 90 of
18.22mg/kg. amodiaquine resistant parasites also resistant chloroquine
(6fold), artemether (10fold), primaquine (5fold), piperaquine (2fold) and
lumefantrine (3fold). sequence analysis plasmodium berghei chloroquine
resistant transporter revealed his95pro mutation. variation identified 
plasmodium berghei multidrug resistance gene-1 (pbmdr1), plasmodium berghei
deubiquitinating enzyme-1 plasmodium berghei kelch13 domain nucleotide
sequences. amodiaquine resistance also accompanied high mrna transcripts of
key transporters; pbmdr1, v-type/h+ pumping pyrophosphatase-2 sodium hydrogen
ion exchanger-1 ca 2+/h + antiporter. conclusions: selection amodiaquine
resistance yielded stable "multidrug-resistant'' parasites thus may used
to study common resistance mechanisms associated antimalarial drugs.
genome wide studies may elucidate functionally important genes controlling 
aq resistance p. berghei.
