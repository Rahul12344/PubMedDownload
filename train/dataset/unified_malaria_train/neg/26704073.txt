some genes gene complexes transmitted parents offspring a
greater-than-mendelian rate, spread persist populations even if
they cause harm individuals carrying them. genes may useful
for controlling populations species harmful. driving-y chromosomes
may particularly potent regard, produce male-biased sex
ratio that, sufficiently extreme, lead population elimination. to
better understand potential genes spread landscape, have
developed series reaction-diffusion models driving-y chromosome 1-d 
and radially-symmetric 2-d unbounded domains. wild-type system carrying
capacity found unstable introduction driving-y males all
models investigated. numerical solutions exhibit travelling wave pulses and
fronts, analytical semi-analytical solutions asymptotic wave
speed bounded initial conditions derived. driving-y male invades
the wild-type equilibrium state front wave completely replaces 
the wild-type males, leaving behind, tail wave, reduced- or
zero-population state females driving-y males only. simplest model 
of population one life stage density-dependent mortality, wave speed
depends strength drive diffusion rate y-drive males, 
independent population dynamic consequences (suppression elimination). 
incorporating immobile juvenile stage fixed duration model reduces
wave speed approximately proportion relative time spent juvenile. 
if females mate life, storing sperm subsequent
reproduction, wave speed depends movement mated females well as
y-drive males, may faster slower multiple-mating model,
depending relative duration juvenile adult life stages. numerical
solutions shown parameter values may part representative for
anopheles gambiae, primary vector malaria sub-saharan africa.
