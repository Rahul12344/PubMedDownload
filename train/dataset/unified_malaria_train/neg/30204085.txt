the mitochondrial atp synthase macromolecular motor uses proton
gradient generate atp. proper atp synthase function requires stator linking 
the catalytic rotary portions complex. however, sequence-based
searches fail identify genes encoding stator subunits apicomplexan
parasites like toxoplasma gondii related organisms cause malaria.
here, identify 11 previously unknown subunits toxoplasma atp
synthase, lack homologs outside phylum. modeling suggests two of
them, icap2 icap18, distantly related mammalian stator subunits. our
analysis shows proteins form part atp synthase complex.
depletion icap2 leads aberrant mitochondrial morphology, decreased oxygen
consumption, disassembly complex, consistent role an
essential component toxoplasma atp synthase. findings highlight
divergent features central metabolic machinery apicomplexans, may
reveal new therapeutic opportunities.
