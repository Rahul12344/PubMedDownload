background: chloroquine resistance (cqr) phenotype plasmodium falciparum is
associated mutations pfcrt pfmdr-1 genes. mutations amino acid
position 72-76 pfcrt gene, defined pfcrt haplotype associated with
the geographic origin chloroquine resistant parasite. here, mutations 72-76
and codon 220 pfcrt gene n86y pfmdr-1 mutation studied blood
samples collected across 11 field sites, inclusive high low p. falciparum 
prevalent areas india. probable correlation mutations and
clinical outcome cq treatment also investigated.
methods: finger pricked blood spotted whatman no.3 papers collected 
falciparum malaria patients high low p. falciparum prevalent areas. for
pfcrt haplotype investigation, parasite dna extracted blood samples 
and used pcr amplification, followed partial sequencing pfcrt gene.
for pfmdr-1 n86y mutation, pcr product subjected restriction digestion
with afliii endonuclease enzyme.
results: 240 p. falciparum isolates reported vivo cq therapeutic
efficacy, analysis mutations pfcrt gene shows mutant svmnt-s
(67.50%) cviet-s (23.75%) occurred irrespective clinical outcome wild 
type cvmnk-a (7.91%) occurred adequate clinical parasitological
response samples. 287 p. falciparum isolates, svmnts 192 (66.89%) prevailed in
all study sites showed almost monomorphic existence (98.42% isolates) low 
p. falciparum prevalent areas. however, cviets-s (19.51%) cvmnk-a (11.84%)
occurrence limited high p. falciparum prevalent areas. investigation of
pfmdr-1 n86y mutation shows correlation clinical outcomes. wild type 
n86 prevalent low p. falciparum prevalent areas (94.48%). however,
mutant n86y comparably higher numbers high p. falciparum prevalent 
areas (42.76%).
conclusions: wild type pfcrt gene linked chloroquine sensitivity;
however, presence mutation cannot explain therapeutic efficacy cq in
the current scenario chloroquine resistance. monomorphic existence of
mutant svmnt haplotype, infer inbreeding faster spread cqr parasite in
areas higher p. vivax prevalance chloroquine exposure, whereas,
diversity maintained pfcrt gene high p. falciparum prevalent areas.
