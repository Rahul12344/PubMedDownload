background: metabolic resistance insecticides biggest threat the
continued effectiveness malaria vector control. however, underlying
molecular basis, crucial successful resistance management, remains poorly
characterized.
results: here, demonstrate single amino acid change l119f an
upregulated glutathione s-transferase gene, gste2, confers high levels of
metabolic resistance ddt malaria vector anopheles funestus. genome-wide
transcription analysis revealed gste2 over-expressed
detoxification gene ddt permethrin-resistant mosquitoes benin.
transgenic expression gste2 drosophila melanogaster demonstrated that
over-transcription gene alone confers ddt resistance cross-resistance
to pyrethroids. analysis gste2 polymorphism established point
mutation tightly associated metabolic resistance ddt its
geographical distribution strongly correlates ddt resistance patterns across
africa. functional characterization recombinant gste2 supports the
role l119f mutation, resistant allele efficient at
metabolizing ddt susceptible one. importantly, also show gste2
directly metabolizes pyrethroid permethrin. structural analysis reveals 
the mutation confers resistance enlarging gste2 ddt-binding cavity,
leading increased ddt access metabolism. furthermore, show gste2
is strong directional selection resistant populations, restriction
of gene flow observed african regions, enabling prediction 
future spread resistance.
conclusions: first dna-based metabolic resistance marker mosquitoes
provides essential tool track evolution resistance design
suitable resistance management strategies.
