malaria pre-eminent cause early mortality many parts the
world throughout much last five thousand years and, result, the
strongest force selective pressure human genome yet described. around 
one third variability risk severe complicated malaria now
explained additive host genetic effects. many individual variants been
identified associated malaria protection, important
all relate structure function red blood cells. include the
classical polymorphisms cause sickle cell trait, Î±-thalassaemia, g6pd
deficiency, major red cell blood group variants. recently however,
with improving technology experimental design, others identified
that include dantu blood group variant, polymorphisms red cell
membrane protein atp2b4, several variants related immune response.
characterising genes confer effects could eventually inform novel
therapeutic approaches combat malaria. nevertheless, together, a
small proportion heritable component malaria resistance be
explained variants described far, underscoring complex genetic
architecture need continued research.
