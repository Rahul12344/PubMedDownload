background: anti-malarial resistance plasmodium falciparum remains obstacle
for malaria control. resistance-associated genes analysed brazilian
samples four decades evaluate impact different treatment regimens 
on parasite genetic profile.
methods: samples collected filter paper patients infected the
amazon region 1984 2011. dna extracted chelex® 100 and
monoinfection confirmed pcr. snps pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr pfdhps
genes assessed pcr-rflp. pfmdr1 copy number estimated using real 
time quantitative pcr sybr® green. parasite response assessed ex vivo
with seven concentrations anti-malarial. patients treated according 
to brazilian guidelines: quinine plus tetracycline mefloquine period 1 
act period 2.
results: 96 samples presented pfcrt 76t mutant throughout assessed
periods. addition, isolates showed ex vivo chloroquine resistance. the
pfmdr1 86y detected 1.5% samples period 1, 25% period 2.
all samples presented pfmdr1 1246y. analysis pfmdr1 copy number showed
amplification 37.3% period 1 42% period 2. mutations pfdhfr
were shown follows: 51i samples period 1 81.2% period 2;
59r 6.4% period 2. pfdhfr 108n pfdhps 437g seen all
samples along time; pfdhps 540e 93.7% period 1 75% period 2.
conclusions: 76t mutation associated chloroquine resistance still
present parasite population, although anti-malarial withdrawn
from chemotherapy p. falciparum brazil mid-1980s. isolates
assayed ex vivo chloroquine showed resistant phenotype 76t. no
association observed pfmdr1 mutations resistance quinine,
mefloquine artemisinin derivatives. additionally, pfdhfr 108n mutation
was detected samples throughout evaluated periods, demonstrating
fixation mutant allele parasite population. changes brazilian
national guidelines malaria chemotherapy last 27 years yielded a
discreet genetic impact parasite population.
