background: historically, chittagong hill tracts (cht) bangladesh was
considered hyperendemic malaria. better understand contemporary
malaria epidemiology develop new innovative control strategies,
comprehensive epidemiologic studies ongoing two endemic unions of
bandarban district cht. within studies entomological surveillance has
been undertaken study role existing anopheline species involved 
the malaria transmission cycle throughout year.
methods: cdc miniature light traps deployed collect anopheline mosquitoes
from sleeping room selected houses month single union
(kuhalong). molecular identification carried available anopheles
species complexes. circumsporozoite proteins (csp) plasmodium falciparum,
plasmodium vivax-210 (pv-210) plasmodium vivax-247(pv-247) detected by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) female anopheline mosquitoes. 
to confirm csp-elisa results, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) also performed.
results: total 2,837 anopheline mosquitoes, 2,576 female,
belonging 20 species collected july 2009-june 2010. anopheles
jeyporiensis abundant species (18.9%), followed an. vagus (16.8%)
and an. kochi (14.4%). elisa performed 2,467 female mosquitoes 19
species. 15 (0.6%) female anophelines belonging eight species found be
positive plasmodium infection csp-elisa. those, 11 (0.4%) mosquitoes
were positive p. falciparum four (0.2%) pv-210. mosquito found
positive pv-247. an. maculatus (2.1%, 2/97) highest infection rate
followed an. umbrosus (1.7%, 2/115) an. barbirostris (1.1%, 2/186). 
infected species an. nigerrimus, an. nivipes, an. jeyporiensis, an. kochi,
and an. vagus. 11 p. falciparum csp positive samples, seven turned 
be positive pcr. none samples positive pv-210 positive pcr. 
in terms abundance incrimination, results suggest an. maculatus, 
an. jeyporiensis an. nivipes play important roles malaria transmission 
kuhalong.
conclusion: findings study suggest even presence an
insecticide impregnated bed-net intervention, number anopheles species still
play role transmission malaria. investigations required
to reveal detailed biology insecticide resistance patterns vector 
mosquito species endemic areas bangladesh order assist the
planning implementation improved malaria control strategies.
