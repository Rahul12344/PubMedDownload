background: human (homo sapiens) chemokine-like protein macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor (hsmif) pivotal mediator inflammatory, infectious and
immune diseases including septic shock, colitis, malaria, rheumatoid arthritis,
and atherosclerosis, well tumorigenesis. hsmif found exhibit
several sequential three-dimensional sequence motifs addition 
receptor binding sites include catalytic sites oxidoreductase tautomerase
activity, provide 12.5Â kda protein remarkable functional
complexity. human mif paralog, d-dopachrome tautomerase (hsddt), been
identified, physiological relevance incompletely understood.
mif/ddt-like proteins described animals, protists bacteria.
although based sequence data banks presence mif/ddt-like proteins has
also recognized model plant species arabidopsis thaliana, details 
these plant proteins reported.
results: broaden understanding biological role proteins
across kingdoms performed comprehensive silico analysis plant
mif/ddt-like (mdl) genes/proteins. found a. thaliana genome harbors
three mdl genes, two chiefly constitutively expressed aerial
plant organs, third gene shows stress-inducible transcript
accumulation. product latter gene likely localizes peroxisomes.
structure prediction suggests three arabidopsis proteins resemble the
secondary tertiary structure human mif. mif-like proteins found all
species across plant kingdom, increasing family complexity towards
evolutionarily advanced plant taxa. plant mdl proteins predicted lack
oxidoreductase activity, possibly share tautomerase activity human
mif/ddt.
conclusions: peroxisome localization seems specific feature subset
of mif/ddt orthologs found dicotyledonous plant species, together with
its stress-inducible gene expression might point convergent evolution in
higher plants vertebrates towards neofunctionalization mif/mdl proteins in
stress response pathways including innate immunity.
