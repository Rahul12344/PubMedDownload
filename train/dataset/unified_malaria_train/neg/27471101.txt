artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum threatens global efforts the
elimination eradication malaria. several studies associated mutations 
in pfatp6 gene conjunction artemisinin resistance, underlying
molecular mechanism resistance remains unexplored. associated mutations
act biomarker measure artemisinin efficacy. proposed work, 
have analyzed binding affinity efficacy pfatp6 artemisinin in
the presence l263d, l263e l263k mutations. furthermore, performed
virtual screening identify potential compounds inhibit pfatp6 mutant
proteins. study, observed artemisinin binding affinity with
pfatp6 gets affected l263d, l263e l263k mutations. silico
elucidation artemisinin resistance enhanced identification novel
compounds (cid: 10595058 10625452) showed good binding affinity and
efficacy l263d, l263e l263k mutant proteins molecular docking and
molecular dynamics simulations studies. owing high propensity the
parasite drug resistance need new antimalarial drugs persist
until malarial parasites eventually eradicated. two compounds
identified study tested vitro vivo experiments as
possible candidates designing new potential antimalarial drugs.
