background: role epigenetic mechanisms towards regulation complex life 
cycle/pathogenesis plasmodium falciparum, causative agent malaria, 
been poorly understood. elucidate stage-specific epigenetic regulation, we
performed genome-wide mapping multiple histone modifications p. falciparum.
further understand differences transcription regulation p.
falciparum host, human, compared histone modification profiles.
results: comprehensive comparative analysis suggests distinct mode of
transcriptional regulation malaria parasite virtue poised genes and
differential histone modifications. furthermore, analysis histone modification
profiles predicted 562 genes producing anti-sense rnas 335 genes having
bidirectional promoter activity, raises intriguing possibility of
rna-mediated regulation transcription p. falciparum. interestingly, we
found h3k36me2 acts global repressive mark gene regulation fine 
tuned ratio activation marks h3k36me2 p. falciparum. novel
mechanism gene regulation supported fact knockout set genes 
(responsible h3k36 methylation) leads up-regulation genes highest 
occupancy h3k36me2 wild-type p. falciparum. moreover, virulence (var) genes
are mostly poised marked unique set activation (h4ac) repression 
(h3k9me3) marks, mutually exclusive plasmodium housekeeping
genes.
conclusions: study reveals unique plasticity epigenetic regulation 
p. falciparum influence parasite virulence pathogenicity. the
observed differences histone code transcriptional regulation p.
falciparum host open new avenues epigenetic drug development
against malaria parasite.
