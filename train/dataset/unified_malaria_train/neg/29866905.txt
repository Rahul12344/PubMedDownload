transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) interrupting malaria transmission an
integrated tool malaria eradication. characterized sexual-stage-specific
gene (pbanka_060330) plasmodium berghei studied potential use as
a tbv. gene, referred pbg37, encodes protein 37 kda signal
peptide multiple transmembrane domains preferentially expressed in
gametocytes. recombinant pbg37 (rpbg37) protein targeting n-terminal 63
amino acids (amino acids 26 88) expressed bacteria elicited strong antibody
responses mice. western blotting demonstrated pbg37 expression gametocytes,
zygotes, and, lesser extent, ookinetes predominant association 
the membranes gametocytes. indirect immunofluorescence assay showed an
abundant surface localization pbg37 gametes zygotes reduced amounts
on retorts ookinetes. knockout pbg37 (δpbg37) led considerable
reduction gametocytemia, translated ~92.1% decrease oocyst
number mosquitoes. deletion pbg37 substantial influence the
development maturation microgametocytes. result, δpbg37 lines
exhibited higher female/male gametocyte ratio, fewer mature male gametocytes,
and defects exflagellation mature microgametocytes. test the
transmission-blocking potential pbg37, vitro ookinete assay showed 
the major inhibitory effects anti-pbg37 antiserum exflagellation
and fertilization processes. direct feeding mosquitoes mice immunized 
rpbg37 control protein showed rpbg37-immunized p. berghei-infected 
mice significant reduction (49.1%) oocyst density compared the
controls. conservation gene plasmodium warrants further
investigations human malaria parasites.
