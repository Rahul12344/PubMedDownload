plasmodium falciparum causes severe form malaria humans and
invades erythrocytes using multiple ligand-receptor interactions. two important
protein families involved erythrocyte binding erythrocyte binding-like
(ebl) reticulocyte binding-like (rbl p. falciparum rh [pfrh])
proteins. constructed p. falciparum lines lacking expression ebl proteins
by creating single double knockouts corresponding genes eba-175,
eba-181, eba-140 show ebl pfrh proteins function
cooperatively, consistent playing similar role merozoite invasion.
we provide evidence pfrh ebl proteins functionally interact, loss 
function eba-181 ablates ability pfrh2a/b protein antibodies inhibit
merozoite invasion. additionally, loss function ebl genes results in
selection increased transcription pfrh family. provides a
rational basis considering pfrh ebl proteins use combination
vaccine p. falciparum. immunized rabbits combinations pfrh and
ebl proteins test ability antibodies block merozoite invasion in
growth inhibition assays. combination eba-175, pfrh2a/b, pfrh4
recombinant proteins induced antibodies potently blocked merozoite invasion.
this validates use combination ligands potential vaccine
that would broad activity p. falciparum.
