eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eif5a) small acidic protein
highly conserved archaea mammals. eif5a protein which
undergoes unique lysine residue modification hypusine. hypusinylation is
important function eif5a reported essential cell
viability. eif5a promotes formation first peptide bond onset of
protein synthesis. however, function leishmania donovani unclear. the
present study focuses characterization localization l. donovani
eif5a protein. eif5a gene contains orf 501×bp encoding 166 amino acid
residues predicted molecular mass isoelectric point 17.8 kda and
4.83 respectively. phylogenetic tree analysis revealed close proximity to
trypanosomes however distantly located trichomonas vaginalis and
plasmodium falciparum. l. donovani eif5a expressed 6× tagged
protein whose identity confirmed western blot maldi. biophysical
investigation cd revealed predominant presence 49% β sheet structure
which correlated well secondary structure prediction. gain insight into
the role eif5a l. donovani, investigated subcellular distribution of
eif5a. gfp-fusion l. donovani eif5a found localized cytoplasm
as confirmed subcellular fractionation. studies indicated eif5a is
primarily localized cytoplasm undetectable nuclear fraction. the
homology model eif5a l. donovani built resulting model showed
acceptable ramachandran statistics. model reliable used to
study eif5a binding effector molecules.
