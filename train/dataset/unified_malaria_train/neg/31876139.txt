efficacy.

plasmodium falciparum causes severe form malaria causes
approximately 500â€¯000 deaths per year. p. falciparum parasites resistant to
current antimalarial treatments spreading. therefore, imperative to
develop new antimalarial drugs. malaria parasites purine auxotrophic. they
rely purine import host erythrocyte via equilibrative nucleoside
transporters (ents). recently, inhibitors p. falciparum ent1 (pfent1) that
inhibit proliferation malaria parasites culture identified as
promising starting points antimalarial drug development. genome sequencing of
p. falciparum field isolates identified nonsynonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) gene encoding pfent1. evaluate impact 
these pfent1 snps purine substrate affinity inhibitor efficacy. we
expressed pfent1-snp saccharomyces cerevisiae. using
pfent1-snp-expressing yeast, characterized pfent1 purine substrate
affinity using radiolabeled substrate uptake inhibition experiments. four 
13 snps altered affinity one purines 7-fold. three the
snps reduced potency subset inhibitors 7-fold. one snp, 
q284e, reduced potency six inhibitor chemotypes. tested drug
efficacy available parasite strains containing pfent1 snps. while
pfent1-snp-expressing yeast decreased sensitivity pfent1 inhibitors,
parasite strains containing snps showed similar potent inhibition of
proliferation pfent1 inhibitors. thus, parasite strains bearing pfent1
snps resistant pfent1 inhibitors. supports pfent1 a
promising target development novel antimalarial drugs.
