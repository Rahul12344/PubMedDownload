malaria caused parasites genus plasmodium. human-infecting
plasmodium species establish long-lasting chronic infections1-5, creating 
infectious reservoir sustain transmission1,6. widely accepted the
maintenance chronic infection involves evasion adaptive immunity by
antigenic variation7. however, genes involved process been
identified two five human-infecting species: plasmodium falciparum and
plasmodium knowlesi. furthermore, little understood early events 
the establishment chronic infection species. using rodent model 
demonstrate infecting population, minority parasites,
expressing one several clusters virulence-associated pir genes, establishes
a chronic infection. process occurs different species parasites in
different hosts. establishment chronicity independent adaptive immunity 
and therefore different mechanism proposed maintenance chronic p.
falciparum infections7-9. furthermore, show proportions parasites 
expressing different types pir genes regulate time taken establish a
chronic infection. pir genes common most, all, species of
plasmodium10, process may common way regulating establishment of
chronic infections.
