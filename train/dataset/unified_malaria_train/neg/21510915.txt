the aim present study find evidence homologous protein the
mammalian cytochrome p450 family member cyp2b1/b2 plasmodium falciparum the
nucleic acid level. prior research demonstrated enzyme activity the
parasite comparable mammalian cyp1a, 2a, 2b 2e enzymes presence cyp
enzymes spectrophotometric electrophoretic analyses. recent years, 
transcriptome/proteome data p. falciparum plasmodium spp. 
published performed silico analysis identify putative cytochrome 
p450 family members parasite. analysis failed identify homologs to
cyp1a, 2a, 2b 2e enzymes plasmodium. prior study also claimed the
presence conserved cyp2b1/b2 gene parasite using northern analysis
with rat cyp2b1/b2 probe. repeated analysis cloning rat
cyp2b1/b2 cdna using hybridization probe total rna extracted 
from p. falciparum k1 3d7 clones obtain positive results. is
consistent transcriptome/proteome sequence data suggests the
genus plasmodium contains either highly diverged cyp proteins 
easily identified primary sequence functionally
replaced enzymes. suggested studies performed
that allow isolation identification proteins functional
activities.
