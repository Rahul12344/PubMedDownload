malaria infected erythrocytes show increased permeability number solutes 
important parasite growth mediated plasmodial surface anion channel
(psac). p. falciparum clag3 genes recently identified key
determinants psac, though exactly contribute channel function 
whether additional host/parasite proteins required remain unknown. begin
to answer questions, taken biochemical approach. used 
an epitope-tagged clag3 parasite perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments
using membrane fractions infected erythrocytes. native page mass
spectrometry studies reveal clag3 participate least three different
high molecular weight complexes: ~720kda complex consisting clag3, rhoph2
and rhoph3; ~620kda complex consisting clag3 rhoph2; ~480kda
complex composed solely clag3. importantly, complexes found
throughout parasite lifecycle absent untransfected controls.
extracellular biotin labeling protease susceptibility studies localize the
480kda complex erythrocyte membrane. complex, likely composed a
homo-oligomer 160kda clag3, may represent functional subunit, possibly the
pore, psac.
