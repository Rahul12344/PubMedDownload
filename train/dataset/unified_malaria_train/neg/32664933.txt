background: malaria one prevalent infectious disease world 
with 3.2 billion humans risk. malaria causes splenomegaly damage 
organs including skeletal muscles. skeletal muscles comprise nearly 50% the
human body largely responsible regulation modulation of
overall metabolism. essential understand malaria damages muscles 
order develop effective preventive measures and/or treatments. using a
pre-clinical animal model, potential molecular mechanisms plasmodium
infection affecting skeletal muscles mice investigated.
methods: mouse signal transduction pathway finder pcr array used monitor
gene expression changes 10 essential signalling pathways skeletal muscles
from mice infected plasmodium berghei plasmodium chabaudi. then, new
targeted-lipidomic approach using liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) profile 158 lipid signalling mediators (lms), mostly
eicosanoids derived arachidonic acid (aa), eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and
docosahexaenoic acid (dha), applied. finally, 16 key lms directly associated 
with inflammation, oxidative stress, tissue healing skeletal muscles, were
quantified.
results: results showed expression key genes altered by
plasmodium infection associated inflammation, oxidative stress, and
atrophy. support gene profiling results, lipidomics revealed higher
concentrations lms skeletal muscles directly related inflammatory
responses, levels lms crucial resolving inflammation and
tissue repair reduced significantly.
conclusion: results provide new insights molecular mechanisms of
malaria-induced muscle damage revealed potential mechanism modulating
inflammation malarial muscles. pre-clinical studies help with
future clinical studies humans aimed monitoring disease progression 
development specific interventions prevention mitigation of
long-term chronic effects skeletal muscle function.
