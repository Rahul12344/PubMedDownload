cancer stem cells promote neoplastic growth, part by deregulating asymmetric
cell division enhancing self-renewal. uncover mechanisms potential
therapeutic targets glioma stem cell (gsc) self-renewal, performed a
genetic suppressor screen kinases reverse tumor phenotype our
drosophila brain tumor model identified dcdk5 critical regulator. cdk5, 
the human ortholog dcdk5 (79% identity), aberrantly activated gbms and
tightly aligned chromosome 7 gains stem cell markers affecting
tumor-propagation. investigation revealed pharmaceutical inhibition of
cdk5 prevents gsc self-renewal in vitro xenografted tumors, least
partially suppressing creb1 activation independently pka/camp. finally, our
tcga gbm data analysis revealed cdk5, stem cell, asymmetric cell
division markers segregate within non-mesenchymal patient clusters, may
indicate preferential dependence cdk5 signaling sensitivity its
inhibition group.
