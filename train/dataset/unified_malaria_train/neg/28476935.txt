myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), heterogeneous group immune cells
from myeloid lineage, play important part suppression host immune
responses many pathologic conditions, including cancer infectious
diseases. thus, understanding functional diversity cells well 
the underlying mechanisms crucial development disease control
strategies. role mdscs schistosoma japonicum infection, however, is
not clear, lack systematic study far. study, we
provide strong evidence soluble egg ag (sea) schistosome worm ag
(swa) s. japonicum enhance accumulation mdscs. ag-induced mdscs have
more potent suppressive effects cell responses control mdscs both
in vivo s. japonicum infection vitro sea- swa-treated mouse bone
marrow cells experiments. interestingly, enhanced suppressive activity of
mdscs ag administration coupled dramatic induction nadph
oxidase subunits gp91phox p47phox dependent production of
reactive oxygen species. moreover, mechanistic studies revealed ag
effects mediated jak/stat3 signaling. inhibition stat3 phosphorylation 
by jak inhibitor jsi-124 almost completely abolished ag effects the
mdscs. summary, study sheds new light immune modulatory role of
sea swa demonstrates expansion mdscs may important
element cellular network regulating immune responses s. japonicum
