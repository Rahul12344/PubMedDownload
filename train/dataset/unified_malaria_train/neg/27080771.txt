objective: present study aims find mutational prevalence of
plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene assam
and arunachal pradesh, india.
methods: fulfil objective study, total 54 p. falciparum
malaria positive samples attempted genotyping pfcrt gene using
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) direct dna sequencing method.
results: k76t mutation observed 77.78% cases followed m74i
(61.11%), n75e (61.11%) c72s (16.67%). triple mutant allele m74i+n75e+k76t
was found 61.11% p. falciparum field isolates. double mutant allele c72s+k76t 
was seen among 16.67% samples. mutation studies shown existence three
different haplotypes two associated chloroquine resistance.
the haplotype cviet found preponderance circulated four districts.
the haplotype svmnt observed karbi anglong district assam.
maximum haplotype diversity also recorded karbi anglong district of
assam.
conclusion: study confirmed high prevalence mutant pfcrt genotypes
associated chloroquine resistance assam arunachal pradesh, india.
