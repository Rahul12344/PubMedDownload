introduction. despite efforts malaria control programme, malaria
morbidity still common health problem yemen, 60% population
at risk. plasmodium falciparum responsible 99% malaria cases. the
emergence yemen parasite resistance chloroquine (cq) prompted the
adoption artemisinin combination therapy (act) 2009, involves use
of artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (as + sp). however, cq retained
as drug choice vivax malaria. assess impact change in
the malaria treatment policy five years introduction, present study
investigated mutations cq resistance transporter (pfcrt) multidrug
resistance 1 (pfmdr1) genes. method. molecular investigation 10 codons of
pfcrt (72-76, 220, 271, 326, 356, 371) five codons pfmdr1 (86, 184,
1034, 1042, 1246) conducted p. falciparum isolates districts with
the highest malaria endemicity hodeidah al-mahwit governorates in
tehama region, yemen. total 86 positive cases falciparum monoinfection
were investigated presence mutations related cq other
antimalarials using pcr-rflp assay. results. wide prevalence of
pfcrt gene mutations pfcrt 76t cq resistance marker predominant
(97.7%). prevalence pfcrt mutations varied high (75e: 88%) to
moderate (74i: 79.1%, 220s: 69.8%, 271e 371i: 53.5%) low (326s: 36%, 72s: 
10.5%). mutated pfcrt 72-76 amino acids haplotypes highly prevalent (98.8%).
among these, cviet classic, old-world african/southeast asian haplotype was
the predominant, mostly found isolates khamis bani
saad district al-mahwit (93.1%) addahi district hodeidah (88.9%).
however, found 26.3% isolates bajil district of
hodeidah. surprisingly, svmnt new-world south american haplotype was
exclusively detected 9.3% isolates bajil district hodeidah.
mutations y184f pfmdr1 found isolates (100%) all
districts. mutation codons 1034c 86y found isolates 
from addahi khamis bani saad districts. overall, addahi khamis
bani saad districts similar terms carrying mutations in
the pfcrt pfmdr1 genes, lower prevalence mutation the
isolates bajil district. conclusion. high prevalence mutations in
pfcrt 5 years official cessation cq use p. falciparum
suggests sustained cq pressure p. falciparum isolates the
study area. moreover, low prevalence mutations pfmdr1 gene could be
a good indicator high susceptibility p. falciparum isolates to
antimalarials cq. new strategy ensure complete nationwide
withdrawal cq private drug market recommended.
