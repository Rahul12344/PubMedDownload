background: plasmodium vivax parasites predominant cause malaria
infections brazilian amazon. infected individuals treated with
primaquine, induce haemolytic anaemia glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (g6pd)-deficient individuals may lead severe fatal
complications. x-linked disorder distributed globally caused by
allelic variants geographical distribution closely reflects
populations exposed historically endemic malaria. brazil, studies 
reported frequency g6pd deficiency (g6pdd) present malaria-endemic
areas. particularly important, g6pdd screening currently
performed primaquine treatment. aim study determine the
prevalence g6pdd region alto juruá, western brazilian
amazon, area characterized high prevalence p. vivax infection.
methods: five-hundred sixteen male volunteers screened g6pdd using
the fluorescence spot test (beutler test) carestart™ g6pd biosensor system.
demographic clinical-epidemiological data acquired individual
interview. assess genetic basis g6pdd, 24 snps genotyped using the
kompetitive allele specific pcr assay.
results: twenty-three (4.5%) individuals g6pdd. association found
between g6pdd number malaria cases. increased risk reported
haemolysis symptoms blood transfusions evident among g6pdd
individuals. twenty-two individuals g6pdd a(-) variant one g6pd
a(+) variant. mediterranean variant present. apart one
polymorphism, almost snps monomorphic low frequencies (0-0.04%).
no differences detected among ethnic groups.
conclusions: data indicates ~1/23 males alto juruá could 
g6pd deficient risk haemolytic anaemia treated primaquine. g6pd
a(-) frequent deficiency allele population. results
concur reported g6pdd regions brazil. routine g6pdd screening to
personalize primaquine administration considered, particularly as
complete treatment patients vivax malaria using chloroquine and
primaquine, crucial malaria elimination.
