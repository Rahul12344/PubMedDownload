malaria largely preventable curable disease. however, delay an
inappropriate treatment result serious adverse outcomes patient.
rapid, simple cost-effective diagnostic tests easily adapted 
rapidly scaled-up field community levels needed. study,
accelerated detection methods plasmodium falciparum (pf) plasmodium
vivax (pv) dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase developed based on
the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) method. developed methods
included use species-specific biotinylated primers amplify lamp
amplicons, hybridized specific fitc-labeled dna probes and
visualized chromatographic lateral flow dipstick (lfd). total lamp-lfd
assay time approximately 1.5h. lamp-lfd assays showed similar detection
limit conventional pcr assay performed plasmid dna carrying the
malaria dhfr-ts genes. lamp-lfd showed 10 folds higher detection limit than
pcr performed genomic dna samples pf pv parasites. dhfr-ts
lamp-lfd assays also advantages reduced assay time easy format
for interpretation results.
