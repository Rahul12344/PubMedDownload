populations exposed plasmodium infection develop genetic mechanisms of
protection severe disease. clinical manifestation malaria results 
primarily lysis infected erythrocytes subsequent immune and
inflammatory responses. herein, review genetic alterations associated with
erythrocytes mediators immune system, might influence malaria
outcome. moreover, polymorphisms genes related molecules involved in
mechanisms cytoadherence influence malaria pathology also
discussed. results studies suggested combinatorial
effects set genetic factors erythrocyte-immunology pathway might
be relevant host resistance susceptibility plasmodium infection.
however, results must interpreted caution the

different populations. recent advances molecular biology techniques, 
more robust studies reliable data reported, results of
these studies identified individual genetic factors consideration in
