small laboratory cage trials non-drive gene-drive strains asian
malaria vector mosquito, anopheles stephensi, used investigate release
ratios strain properties impact transgene spread during
simulated population modification. evaluated effects transgenes on
survival, male contributions next-generation populations, female reproductive 
success impact accumulation gene drive-resistant genomic target
sites resulting nonhomologous end-joining (nhej) mutagenesis cas9,
guide rna-mediated cleavage. experiments non-drive, autosomally-linked
malaria-resistance gene cassette showed 'full introduction' (100% insects 
have least one copy transgene) within 8 weeks (≤ 3 generations)
following weekly releases 10:1 transgenic:wild-type males overlapping
generation trial design. male release ratios 1:1 resulted cages where
mosquitoes least one copy transgene fluctuated around 50%. in
comparison, two three cages malaria-resistance genes linked 
to gene-drive system overlapping generation, single 1:1 release reached
full introduction 6-8 generations third cage ~80% within same
time. release ratios 0.1:1 failed establish transgenes. a
non-overlapping generation, single-release trial gene-drive strain
resulted two three cages reaching 100% introduction within 6-12 generations
following 1:1 transgenic:wild-type male release. two three cages 0.33:1
transgenic:wild-type male single releases achieved full introduction 13-16
generations. populations exhibiting full introduction went extinct within
three generations due significant load females disruptions both
copies target gene, kynurenine hydroxylase. repeated releases of
high-ratio (10:1) non-drive constructs could achieve full introduction, results
from 1:1 release ratios across experimental designs favor use gene
drive, efficiency anticipated cost control programs.
