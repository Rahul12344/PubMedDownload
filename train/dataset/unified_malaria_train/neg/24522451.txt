the life cycle plasmodium falciparum complex, erythrocytic
stage involves invasion red blood cells survival growth
of parasite within host. past several decades, numbers of
studies shown proteins exported p. falciparum surface of
infected red blood cells play critical role recognition interaction with
host receptors thus essential completion life cycle p. 
falciparum. however, little known long noncoding rnas (lncrnas). this
study, designed computational pipeline identify new lncrnas p.
falciparum published rna-seq data analyzed sequences and
expression features. result, 164 novel lncrnas found. sequences and
expression features p. falciparum lncrnas similar humans 
mice: lack sequence conservation, low expression levels, high 
expression coefficient variance co-expression nearby coding sequences
in genome. next, coding/noncoding gene co-expression network p.
falciparum constructed annotate functions novel known
lncrnas. total, functions 69 lncrnas, including 44 novel lncrnas, 
annotated. main functions lncrnas included metabolic processes,
biosynthetic processes, regulation biological processes, establishment of
localization, catabolic processes, cellular component organization, and
interspecies interactions organisms. results provide clues to
further investigation interactions human hosts parasites and
the mechanisms p. falciparum infection.
