while technologies global enumeration transcript abundance are
well-developed, assess protein abundance require tailoring to
penetrate low-abundance proteins. ribosome profiling circumvents this
challenge measuring global protein production via sequencing small mrna
fragments protected assembled ribosome. powerful approach now
being applied protozoan parasites including trypanosomes plasmodium. it
has used identify new protein-coding sequences (cdss) clarify the
boundaries previously annotated cdss trypanosoma brucei. ribosome profiling
has demonstrated translation efficiencies vary widely genes and, for
trypanosomes least, gene across stages. ribosomal proteins
are subjected translational control, suggesting means of
reinforcing global translational regulation.
