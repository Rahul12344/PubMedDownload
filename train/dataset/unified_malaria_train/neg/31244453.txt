cerebral malaria (cm) severe neurological complication causing acute
non-traumatic encephalopathy tropical countries. mechanisms underlying the
fatal cerebral complications still fully understood. glutamate, major
excitatory neurotransmitter central nervous system mammalian brain,
plays key role development neuronal cells, motor function, synaptic
plasticity, learning memory processes normal physiological conditions. 
the subtypes ionotropic glutamate receptor n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors 
(nmdars) involved cellular mechanisms learning memory,
synaptic plasticity also mediate excitotoxic neuronal injury. present 
study, found glutamate level synaptosomes, well expression of
nmdar, elevated extreme condition cm c57bl6 mice. arteether 
at 50 mg kg-1 × 1, 25 mg kg-1 × 2, days decreased nmdar expression and
increased overall survival experimental cm mice.
