drug-resistant strains malaria parasites emerged antimalarial
medications. new chemotherapeutic compound needed malarial therapy.
antimalarial activity drug-sensitive drug-resistant p.
falciparum reported isocryptolepine derivative,
8-bromo-2-fluoro-5-methyl-5h-indolo[3,2-c]quinoline (icl-m), also showed
less toxicity human cells. icl-m indoloquinoline core structure and
its mode action remains unclear. here, explored mechanisms icl-m 
p. falciparum assessing stage-specific activity, time-dependent effect, 
proteomic analysis morphology. since human topo ii activity inhibition has
been reported function isocryptolepine derivatives, malarial topo ii
activity inhibition icl-m also examined study. icl-m exhibited
antimalarial activity ring trophozoite stages p.
falciparum. proteomics analysis revealed total 112 p. falciparum
proteins differentially expressed icl-m exposure; among these, 58 
54 proteins upregulated downregulated, respectively. proteins localized 
in food vacuole, nucleus, cytoplasm showed quantitative alterations after
icl-m treatment. bioinformatic analysis revealed pathways associated 
ribosomes, proteasomes, metabolic pathways, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative
phosphorylation, carbon metabolism significantly different p.
falciparum treated icl-m. moreover, loss ribosomes clearly observed
by transmission electron microscopy icl-m-treated p. falciparum. this
finding agreement proteomics data, revealed downregulated
levels ribosomal proteins following icl-m treatment. results provide
important information mechanisms icl-m affects malaria
parasite, may facilitate drug development isocryptolepine
derivatives.
