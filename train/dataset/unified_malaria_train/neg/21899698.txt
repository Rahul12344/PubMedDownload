human fact (facilitates chromatin transcription) consists proteins spt16
and ssrp1 acts histone chaperone (dis)assembly nucleosome (and
thereby chromatin) structure transcription dna replication. we
identified plasmodium berghei protein, termed fact-l, homology the
spt16 subunit fact. epitope tagging fact-l showed nuclear localization with
high expression nuclei (activated) male gametocytes. gene encoding 
fact-l could deleted indicating essential role blood-stage
development. using 'promoter-swap' approach whereby fact-l promoter was
replaced 'asexual blood stage-specific' promoter silent in
gametocytes, transcription fact-l promoter-swap mutant gametocytes was
downregulated compared wild-type gametocytes. mutant male gametocytes 
showed delayed dna replication gamete formation. male gamete fertility was
strongly reduced female gamete fertility unaffected; residual ookinetes
generated oocysts arrested early development failed enter
sporogony. therefore fact critically involved formation fertile male
gametes parasite transmission. 'promoter swapping' powerful approach for
the functional analysis proteins gametocytes (and beyond) are
essential asexual blood-stage development.
