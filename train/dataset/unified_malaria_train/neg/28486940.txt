background: plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes sequester the
microcirculation due interaction surface-expressed parasite proteins
and endothelial receptors. endothelial cells covered carbohydrate-rich
glycocalyx shields undesired leukocyte adhesion. investigated
if cellular glycocalyx affects binding p. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes cd36 vitro.
methods: glycocalyx growth followed vitro using azido sugars and
cationized ferritin detecting o-glycoproteins negatively charged
proteoglycans, respectively. p. falciparum (clone fcr3/it) selected on
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells transfected human cd36. cytoadhesion to
cho cd36 1-4 days seeding quantified using static binding
assay.
results: glycocalyx thickness cho cells increased 4 days culture
as assessed metabolic labelling glycans azido sugars electron
microscopy studying binding cationized ferritin cell surfaces. the
functional importance process addressed binding assays using
cho cells transfected cd36. parallel maturation the
glycocalyx, antibody-binding cd36 inhibited, despite stable expression 
cd36. p. falciparum selected cd36-binding recognized cd36 cho cells the
first day culture, binding lost 2-4 days.
conclusion: endothelial glycocalyx affects parasite cytoadhesion vitro, an
effect previously ignored. previously reported loss of
glycocalyx experimental malaria may play important role the
pathogenesis malaria complications allowing close interaction between
infected erythrocytes endothelial receptors.
