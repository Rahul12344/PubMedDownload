malaria, disease caused plasmodium parasites, remains major global
health burden. liver stage plasmodium falciparum infection leading
target immunological pharmacological interventions. therefore, novel
approaches providing specific detection isolation live p. falciparum
exoerythrocytic forms (eefs) warranted. utilizing recently generated
parasite strain expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp) established a
method which, allows detection isolation developing live p. falciparum
liver stages flow cytometry. using technique compared the
susceptibility five immortalized human hepatocyte cell lines primary
hepatocyte cultures three donors infection p. falciparum sporozoites. 
here, show eefs detected isolated vitro infected
cultures hc-04 cell line primary human hepatocytes. confirmed the
presence developing parasites sorted live human hepatocytes and
characterized morphology fluorescence microscopy. finally, validated 
the practical applications approach re-examining importance host
ligand cd81 hepatocyte infection p. falciparum sporozoites vitro and
assessment inhibitory activity anti-sporozoite antibodies. this
methodology provides us tools study both, basic biology p.
falciparum liver stage effects host-derived factors development
of p. falciparum eefs.
