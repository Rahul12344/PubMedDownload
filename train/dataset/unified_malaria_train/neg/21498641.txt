red blood cell (rbc) invasion parasitophorous vacuole (pv) formation by
plasmodium falciparum critical development pathogenesis of
malaria, continuing global health problem. expansion pv membrane (pvm)
during growth orchestrated parasite. particularly important 
mature rbcs, lack internal organelles longer actively synthesize
membranes. pfs16, 16-kda integral pvm protein expressed gametocytes, was
chosen model studying trafficking material parasite
across pv space pvm. locations pfs16-green fluorescent protein 
(gfp) reporter proteins containing distinct regions pfs16 tracked from
rbc invasion emergence. inclusion 53 c-terminal amino acids (aa) of
pfs16 gfp reporter construct already containing n-terminal secretory
signal sequence sufficient targeting retention pvm. an
amino acid motif identified region also found seven known
pvm proteins. removal 11 c-terminal aa affect pvm targeting, but
membrane retention decreased. additionally, emergence pvm and
rbc, native pfs16 full-length pfs16-gfp reporter protein found to
concentrate ends gametocyte. capping observed constructs
lacking amino acids n-terminal secretory signal sequence 
transmembrane domain, suggesting region, required pvm 
targeting, involved capping. first report define amino
acid domains required targeting p. falciparum pvm.
