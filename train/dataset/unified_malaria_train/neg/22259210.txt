rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) represent important tools diagnose malaria
infection. improve understanding variable performance rdts that
detect major target plasmodium falciparum, namely, histidine-rich protein 
2 (hrp2), inform design better tests, undertook detailed mapping
of epitopes recognized eight hrp-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). to
investigate geographic skewing polymorphic protein, analyzed the
distribution epitopes parasites geographically diverse areas. to
identify ideal amino acid motif mab target hrp2 related
protein hrp3, used purpose-designed script perform bioinformatic analysis
of 448 distinct gene sequences pfhrp2 99 sequences closely
related gene pfhrp3. frequency distribution motifs also
compared mab epitopes. heat stability testing mabs immobilized on
nitrocellulose membranes also performed. results experiments enabled
the identification mabs desirable characteristics inclusion 
in rdts, including copy number coverage target epitopes, geographic
skewing, heat stability, match abundant amino acid motifs
identified. study therefore informs selection mabs include in
malaria rdts well generation improved mabs improve
the performance hrp-detecting malaria rdts.
