an efficient sexing system important release sterile males 
control programme using sterile insect technique. study describes the
development characterization new genetic sexing strain south africa
(gmk), needed planned implementation programme northern
kwazulu-natal province. base colony used locally modified laboratory
strain anopheles arabiensis containing sex-linked gene conferring dieldrin
resistance male mosquitoes. female a. arabiensis mosquitoes northern
kwazulu-natal mated males backcrossed introduce the
dieldrin resistance gene chromosome. resulting strain therefore 
an overall genotype representing local population chromosome
containing dieldrin resistance gene. life-history characteristics, stability 
of sex-linked resistance marker, reduction dieldrin waste were
investigated. strain showed semi-sterility exhibited low egg hatch rates, 
faster development immature stages longer adult survivorship compared 
with parental strains. gmk strain carrying dieldrin-resistant
gene successfully established, stability gene limited,
requiring periodic purification. dieldrin waste limited treating many
more eggs currently recommended.
