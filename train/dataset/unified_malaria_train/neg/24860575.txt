vaccination effective method preventing infectious diseases. since
the eradication small pox 1976, many potentially life compromising if
not threatening diseases dealt subsequently. event a
major leap scientific world already burdened many diseases
but also mindset common man became receptive novel
treatment options. among many protozoan diseases, leishmaniases have
emerged one largest parasite killers world, second to
malaria. three types leishmaniasis namely cutaneous (cl),
mucocutaneous (ml), visceral (vl), caused group 20 species 
of leishmania parasites. visceral leishmaniasis, also known kala-azar the
most severe form almost fatal untreated. since first attempts at
leishmanization, killed parasite vaccines, subunit protein, dna
vaccines, live recombinant carrier vaccines live attenuated
parasite vaccines various stages development. although research has
shown promising results, many potential genes need evaluated live
attenuated vaccine candidates. mini-review attempts summarize success
and failures genetically modified organisms used vaccination some
of major parasitic diseases application leishmaniasis.
