the natural product pepticinnamin e potently inhibits protein farnesyl
transferases potential applications treating cancer malaria.
pepticinnamin e contains rare n-terminal cinnamoyl moiety well several
nonproteinogenic amino acids, including unusual
2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-n-methyl-l-phenylalanine. biosynthesis of
pepticinnamin e remained uncharacterized original producing
strain longer available. identified gene cluster (pcm) this
natural product new producer, actinobacteria bacterium ok006, means 
targeted rediscovery strategy. demonstrated pcm cluster is
responsible biosynthesis pepticinnamin e, nonribosomal
peptide/polyketide hybrid. also characterized key o-methyltransferase that
modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. work identified gene cluster 
for pepticinnamins first time sets stage elucidating the
unique chemistry required biosynthesis.
