background: cerebral malaria (cm) major cause malaria mortality.
sequestration infected red blood cells leukocytes brain vessels coupled
with production pro-inflammatory factors contribute cm. cxcl-10 a
chemokine chemotactic cells linked fatal cm. mice
deficient cxcl-10 gene resistant murine cm, antibody ablation of
cxcl-10 enhanced production regulatory cells (cd4+cd25+foxp3+) il-10
which regulate immune system. interleukin-2 (il-2), pro-inflammatory
cytokine implicated malaria pathogenesis also shown key
regulator foxp3. however role foxp3 resistant murine cm well 
understood.
methods: hypothesis resistance cxcl-10-/- mice murine cm may be
due enhanced expression foxp3 concert il-10 il-2 tested.
cxcl-10-/- wt c57bl/6 mice infected plasmodium berghei anka and
evaluated cm symptoms. brain, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) 
plasma harvested infected uninfected mice days 2, 4 8.
regulatory cells (cd4+cd25+) non-t regs (cd4+cd25-) isolated from
pbmcs cultured p. berghei antigens vitro dendritic cells as
antigen presenting cells. regulatory cell transcription specific factor
foxp3, evaluated mouse brain pbmcs realtime-pcr western blots
while il-10, il-2 evaluated plasma cultured supernatants by
elisa.
results: wild type mice exhibited severe murine cm symptoms compared with
cxcl-10-/- mice. foxp3 mrna protein brain pbmc's cxcl-10-/- mice
was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) day 4 post-infection (p.i) compared 
with wt. plasma levels il-10 il-2 infected cxcl-10-/- higher 
in wt mice (p < 0.05) days 2 4 p.i. ex-vivo cd4+cd25+ cells from
cxcl-10-/- re-stimulated p. berghei antigens produced il-10 wt
cd4+cd25+ cells.
conclusion: results indicate absence cxcl-10, resulting
up-regulation foxp3, il-10 il-2 may involved attenuating fatal
murine cm.
