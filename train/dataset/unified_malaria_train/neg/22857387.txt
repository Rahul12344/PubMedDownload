background: malaria caused plasmodium parasites, transmitted via 
the bites infected anopheline mosquitoes. midgut invasion major
bottleneck plasmodium development inside mosquito vectors. malaria
parasites midgut surrounded hostile environment rich digestive
enzymes, rapidly responding immune system recognizes plasmodium ookinetes
and recruits killing factors midgut surrounding tissues,
dramatically reducing population invading ookinetes can
successfully traverse midgut epithelium. understanding molecular details of
the parasite-vector interactions requires precise measurement nascent protein 
synthesis mosquito plasmodium infection. current expression
profiling primarily monitors alterations steady-state levels mrna, does
not address equally critical issue whether proteins encoded the
mrnas actually synthesized.
results: study, used sucrose density gradient centrifugation to
isolate actively translating anopheles gambiae mrnas based upon association
with polyribosomes (polysomes). proportion individual gene transcripts
associated polysomes, determined rna deep sequencing, reflects
mrna translational status. approach led identification 1017 mosquito
transcripts primarily regulated translational level after
ingestion plasmodium falciparum-infected blood. caspar, negative regulator
of nf-kappab transcription factor rel2, appears substantially activated
at translational levels plasmodium infection. addition, transcripts
of dcr1, dcr2 drosha, involved small rna biosynthesis, exhibited
enhanced associations polysomes p. falciparum challenge. this
observation suggests mosquito micrornas may play important role in
reactions plasmodium invasion.
conclusions: analyzed total cellular mrnas mrnas associated 
with polysomes simultaneously monitor transcriptomes nascent protein
synthesis mosquito. approach provides accurate information
regarding rate protein synthesis, identifies mosquito factors
that might gone unrecognized expression proteins is
regulated mainly translational level rather transcriptional
level mosquitoes ingest plasmodium-infected blood meal.
