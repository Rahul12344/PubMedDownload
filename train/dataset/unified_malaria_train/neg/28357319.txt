in order combat on-going malaria epidemic, discovery new drug targets
remains vital. proteins essential survival specific malaria
parasites key candidates. survive within host cells, parasites need to
acquire nutrients dispose waste products across multiple membranes.
additionally, like eukaryotes, must redistribute ions organic
molecules various internal membrane bound compartments. membrane
transport proteins mediate processes considered important
mediators drug resistance well drug targets right.
recently, using advanced experimental genetic approaches streamlined life
cycle profiling, generated large collection plasmodium berghei gene
deletion mutants assigned essential gene functions, highlighting potential
targets prophylactic, therapeutic, transmission-blocking anti-malarial
drugs. here, present comprehensive orthology assignment plasmodium
falciparum putative membrane transport proteins provide detailed overview
of associated essential gene functions obtained experimental genetics
studies human murine model parasites. furthermore, discuss the
phylogeny selected potential drug targets identified functional screen.
we extensively discuss results context functional assignments
obtained using gene targeting available date.
