simple efficient transfection methods genetic manipulation plasmodium 
falciparum desirable identify, characterize validate genes with
therapeutic potential better understand parasite biology. among available
transfection techniques p. falciparum, electroporation-based methods,
particularly electroporation ring-infected rbcs routinely used.
nonetheless, transfection p. falciparum remains resource-intensive
procedure. here, report simple economic transfection method p.
falciparum, termed lyse-reseal erythrocytes transfection
(lyret). involved lysis erythrocytes hypotonic rbc lysis buffer
containing desired plasmid dna, followed resealing adding high salt
buffer. dna-encapsulated lyse-reseal erythrocytes mixed p.
falciparum trophozoite/schizont stages subjected selection the
plasmid-encoded drug resistance. parallel, transfections also done the
methods utilizing electroporation dna uninfected rbcs and
parasite-infected rbcs. lyret method successfully transfected 3d7 d10
strains different plasmids 63 65 attempts, success rate
similar transfection electroporation dna infected rbcs. cost
effectiveness comparable efficiency lyret method makes alternative
to existing transfection methods p. falciparum, particularly in
resource-limited settings.
