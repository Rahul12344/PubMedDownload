at present, artemisia annua l. major source artemisinin production. 
control outbreaks malaria, artemisinin combination therapies (acts) are
recommended, hence ample amount artemisinin required acts
manufacture save millions lives. low yield antimalarial drug in
a. annua l. plants (0.01-1.1%) ensues short supply high cost, thus making
it topic scrutiny worldwide. study, effects root endophyte,
piriformospora indica strain dsm 11827 nitrogen fixing bacterium, azotobacter
chroococcum strain w-5, either singly and/or combination artemisinin
production a. annua l. plants studied poly house conditions.
the plant growth monitored measuring parameters like height plant,
total dry weight leaf yield increase 63.51, 52.61 79.70%
respectively, treatment dual biological consortium, compared 
of control plants. significant improvement biomass associated with
higher total chlorophyll content (59.29%) enhanced nutrition (especially
nitrogen phosphorus, 55.75 86.21% respectively). concentration of
artemisinin along expression patterns artemisinin biosynthesis genes were
appreciably higher dual treatment, showed positive correlation. the
study suggested potential use consortium p. indica strain dsm 11827
and a. chroococcum strain w-5 a. annua l. plants increased overall
productivity sustainable agriculture.
