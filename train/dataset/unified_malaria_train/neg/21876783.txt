members phylum apicomplexa, includes species plasmodium,
eimeria, toxoplasma, babesia amongst others, successful
intracellular pathogens known humankind. widespread acquisition of
antimicrobial resistance drugs used date sparked great deal of
research commercial interest development vaccines alternative
control strategies. antigens asexual sexual stages of
apicomplexan development identified genes characterised;
however, fine cellular molecular details effector mechanisms
crucial parasite inhibition stimulation protective immunity still 
not entirely understood. paper provides overview currently
known protective immune response various types of
apicomplexan parasites focuses mainly similarities pathogens 
and host interaction. finally, evolutionary relationships these
parasites hosts, well modulation immune functions are
critical determining outcome infection pathogenic
organisms, discussed.
