antifolate antimalarials, pyrimethamine, experienced dramatic
reduction therapeutic efficacy resistance evolved multiple malaria
species. present evidence one species, plasmodium vivax, has
experienced sustained selection pyrimethamine resistance dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) locus since 1970s. using transgenic saccharomyces
cerevisiae model expressing p. vivax dhfr enzyme, assayed growth rate 
resistance 16 combinations four dhfr amino acid substitutions. these
substitutions selected based known association drug
resistance, natural isolates laboratory settings, related
malaria species p. falciparum. observed strong correlation the
resistance phenotypes 16 p. vivax alleles previously observed
resistance data p. falciparum, surprising since nucleotide
diversity levels common polymorphic variants dhfr differ two
species. similar results observed expressed p. vivax alleles 
a transgenic bacterial system. suggests common constraints enzyme
evolution orthologous dhfr proteins. interplay negative trade-offs 
between evolution novel resistance compromised endogenous function
varies different drug dosages, major trajectories dhfr
evolution. simulations, high drug dosages most
resistant quadruple mutant dhfr allele favored selection. in
agreement common polymorphic dhfr data p. vivax, this
quadruple mutant missing. propose clinical dosages pyrimethamine
may historically low select resistant allele, or
that fitness cost resistant allele untenable without a
compensatory mutation elsewhere genome.
