background: chloroquine (cq) primaquine (pq) still drugs choice to
treat plasmodium vivax malaria many endemic areas, brazil included. is
in vivo evidence p. vivax resistance cq brazilian amazon, where
the increase proportion p. vivax malaria parallels increase of
unusual clinical complications related species. study, vitro
cq mefloquine (mq)-susceptibility p. vivax isolates western
brazilian amazon tested using double-site enzyme-linked lactate
dehydrogenase immunodetection (deli) assay.
methods: total 112 p. vivax isolates tested vitro for
cq-susceptibility 47 also tested mq-susceptibility. the
deli assay used detect p. vivax growth 48-hour short-term culture in
isolates ring stages ranging 50 %. isolate tested in
triplicate geometric means ic50's obtained. nineteen isolates were
genetically characterized pvdhfr, pvmrp1, pvmdr1 pvdhps candidate genes
likely related cq resistance (10 ic50<40 nm 9 ic50 >100 nm).
results: twelve 112 isolates considered resistant cq, resulting in
10.7% (ic95% 5.0-16.4), 3 47 (6.4%; ic95% 0.0-12.8) resistant
to mq. discrete correlation observed ic50's cq mq
(spearman=0.294; p=0.045). pvdhps gene, non-synonymous mutation found
at codon 382 (s→c) 5/8 cq-sensitive samples 1/9 cq-resistant samples
(p=0.027). molecular markers associated cq-susceptibility.
conclusions: vitro cq-resistance estimated study, estimated the
deli test, similar observed clinical trials, suggesting 
in vitro procedures developed capable local laboratories useful the
surveillance cq-resistance amazon; concurrent amazon p. vivax strains
with cq mq resistance may common; non-synonymous mutation at
pvdhps codon 382 (s→c) associated vitro susceptibility cq, needing
further studies confirmed.
