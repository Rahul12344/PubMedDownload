background: vaccines reliable alternative elicit sterile immunity
against malaria development hindered polymorphisms and
strain-specificity previously studied antigens. new vaccine candidates are
therefore urgently needed. highly conserved plasmodium falciparum
reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (pfrh5) identified a
potential candidate anti-disease vaccine development. pfrh5 essential 
erythrocyte invasion merozoites crucial parasite survival. however,
there paucity data extent genetic variations pfrh5 field
isolates plasmodium falciparum. study described genetic polymorphisms 
the high affinity binding polypeptides (habps) 36718, 36727, 36728 pfrh5 in
nigerian isolates p. falciparum. study tested hypothesis only
specific conserved b cell epitopes pfrh5 habps crucial vaccine
development.
methods: one hundred ninety-five microscopically confirmed p. falciparum
samples collected prospective cross-sectional study three different
populations lagos, nigeria. genetic diversity haplotype construct pfrh5
gene determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. tajima's the
ratio nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations utilized estimate the
extent balancing directional selection pfrh5 gene.
results: sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes pfrh5 negative
tajima's dn/ds value - 1.717 0.011 ± 0.020, respectively. single
nucleotide polymorphism, snp (g → a) position 608 observed, resulted
in change amino acid cysteine position 203 tyrosine. haplotype and
nucleotide diversities 0.318 ± 0.016 0.0046 ± 0.0001 while
inter-population genetic differentiation ranged 0.007 0.037. five
polypeptide variants identified, frequent ktkyh a
frequency 51.3%. one b-cell epitope, 151 major histocompatibility complex
(mhc) class ii t-cell epitopes, four intrinsically unstructured regions (iurs)
and six mhc class t-cell epitopes observed study. phylogenetic
analysis sequences showed clustering evidence evolutionary
relationship 3d7, pas-2 fcb-2 rh5 sequences.
conclusions: study revealed low level genetic polymorphisms pfrh5 
antigen b- t-cell epitopes intrinsically unstructured regions along
the pfrh5 gene lagos, nigeria. broader investigation however required 
other parts country support possible inclusion pfrh5 a
cross-protective multi-component vaccine.
