hawaiian honeycreepers (drepanidinae) evolved absence mosquitoes
for five million years. human activity, mosquitoes introduced
to hawaiian archipelago less 200 years ago. mosquito-vectored diseases
such avian malaria caused plasmodium relictum avipoxviruses have
greatly impacted vulnerable species. susceptibility diseases is
variable among within species. due function adaptive immunity,
the role major histocompatibility complex genes (mhc) disease
susceptibility investigation. study, evaluate gene
organization levels diversity mhc class ii β chain genes (exon 2) 
captive-reared family hawaii 'amakihi (hemignathus virens). total 233
sequences (173 bp) obtained pcr+1 amplification cloning, 5720
sequences generated roche 454 pyrosequencing. report total 17
alleles originating minimum 14 distinct loci. detected three linkage
groups appear represent three distinct haplotypes. phylogenetic analysis 
revealed one variable cluster resembling classical mhc sequences (dab) one
highly conserved, low variability cluster resembling non-classical mhc sequences 
(dbb). high net evolutionary divergence values dab dbb resemble 
seen chicken blb system ylb system genes. high amino acid identity
among non-classical alleles 12 species passerines (dbb) four species 
of galliformes (ylb) found, suggesting non-classical passerine
sequences may related galliforme ylb sequences.
