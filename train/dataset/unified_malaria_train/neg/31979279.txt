malaria remains significant disease, causing epic health problems and
challenges world, especially sub-saharan africa. cd209 cd28
genes act co-stimulators regulators immune system, stat6 
gene reported mediate cytokine-induced responses. single nucleotide
polymorphisms genes might lead differential disease susceptibility
among populations risk malaria, due alterations immune response.
we aim identify key drivers immune response malaria infection among 
the three snps: cd209 (rs4804803), cd28 (rs35593994) stat6 (rs3024974). after
approval informed consent, genotyped blood samples total 531
children recruited nigeria using taqman snp genotyping assay and
performed comparative analysis clinical covariates among malaria-infected
children. results reveal cd209 (rs4804803) polymorphism a
susceptibility factor malaria infection, significantly increasing risk of
disease among children, cd28 (rs35593994) stat6 (rs3024974)
polymorphisms. specifically, individuals homozygous mutant allele
(rs4804803g/g) cd209 gene significantly greater susceptibility 
malaria, presented higher mean parasitemia. observation may due 
to defective antigen presentation priming, leading ineffective
downstream adaptive immune response needed combat infection, well the
resultant higher parasitemia disease manifestation. conclude the
cd209 gene critical driver immune response malaria infection, 
and serve predictor disease susceptibility biomarker disease
diagnosis.
