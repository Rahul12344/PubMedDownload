the k13 propeller domain mutation pfmdr1 amplification proposed 
useful molecular markers detection monitoring artemisinin resistant
plasmodium falciparum welch, 1897. genomic dna isolates p. falciparum was
extracted 235 dried blood spot whole blood samples collected from
patients uncomplicated falciparum malaria residing areas along the
thai-myanmar border 2006-2010. nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) 
sequencing performed detect mutations k13 propeller domain p.
falciparum codon 427-709. pfmdr1 gene copy number determined sybr green
i real-time pcr. high prevalence pfmdr1 multiple copies observed (42.5% of
isolates). presence k13 mutations low (40/235, 17.2%). seventeen
mutations previously reported six mutations newly detected. the
c580y found two isolates (0.9%). f446i, n458y p574l mutations were
commonly detected. seven isolates k13 mutation pfmdr1 multiple
copies. needs confirmed whether parasites harbouring k13 mutation
and pfmdr1 multiple copies and/or observed new mutations k13 propeller
domain associated clinical artemisinin resistance.
