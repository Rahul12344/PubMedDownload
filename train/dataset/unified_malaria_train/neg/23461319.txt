hamilton zuk proposed females choose mates based ornaments whose
expression dependent genetically based resistance parasites. the
major histocompatibility complex (mhc) plays important role pathogen
recognition good candidate testing relationships immune 
genes ornament expression parasite resistance. tested the
hypothesis female common yellowthroats prefer mate ornamented
males, signal mhc-based resistance parasites and
likelihood survival. species, females prefer males larger
black facial masks extrapair mates. using pyrosequencing, found mask
size positively related number different mhc class ii alleles, as
predicted greater variation mhc allows recognition greater
variety pathogens. furthermore, males mhc class ii alleles had
greater apparent survival, resistance malaria infection associated
with presence particular mhc class ii allele. thus, extrapair mating may
provide female warblers immunity genes related parasite
resistance, survival, expression male ornament, consistent good
genes models sexual selection.
