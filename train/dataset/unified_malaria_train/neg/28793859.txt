background: understanding molecular basis insecticide resistance key to
improve surveillance monitoring malaria vector populations under
control. major malaria vector anopheles funestus, little currently
known role knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism. here, we
investigated presence contribution knockdown resistance (kdr) to
pyrethroids/ddt resistance observed anopheles funestus across africa.
results: pyrosequencing genotyping sequencing voltage gated sodium
channel (vgsc) gene detect common l1014f mutation field collected 
an. funestus across africa. amplification cloning full-length the
sodium channel gene pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes revealed evidences of
alternative splicing events three transcripts 2092, 2061 2117 amino
acids (93% average similarity an. gambiae). several amino acid changes were
detected close domain ii protein l928r, f938 w, i939s,
l802s t1008 m. however, mutations found low frequency and
their role pyrethroid resistance could established. presence the
exclusive alternative splicing exon 19 associated resistance
phenotype. analysis patterns genetic diversity vgsc gene revealed 
high polymorphism level gene across africa evidence of
directional selection suggesting limited role knockdown resistance in
pyrethroid resistance an. funestus. patterns genetic differentiation
correlate previous observations existence barriers gene flow
africa-wide southern population significantly differentiated other
regions.
conclusion: despite apparent limited role knockdown resistance an.
funestus, necessary continue monitor contribution the
mutations detected increasing selection insecticide-based
interventions may change dynamic field populations previously observed 
in vectors.
