background: blood group phenotype variation attributed potential
resistance pathogen invasion. variation mapped blood donors from
lampang (northern region) saraburi (central region), thailand, malaria 
is endemic. previously unknown blood group allele profiles characterized
and data correlated phenotypes. high incidence the
vel-negative phenotype previously reported thais investigated.
study design methods: dna 396 blood donors analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
outliers investigated serology dna sequencing. allele discrimination 
assays smim1 rs1175550a/g ackr1 rs118062001c/t performed and
correlated antigen expression.
results: samples phenotyped rh, mns, k. genotyping/phenotyping
for rhd, k, s/s showed 100% concordance. investigation three rhce outliers
revealed e-variant antigen encoded rhce*02.22. screening rs147357308
(rhce c.667t) revealed frequency 3.3%. mn typing discrepancies 41 samples
revealed glycophorin variants, 40 41 due mia . nine samples
(2.3%) heterozygous fy*01w.01 (c.265c > t), six samples (1.5%) 
heterozygous jk*02n.01. samples wildtype smim1 homozygotes 97% 
homozygosity rs1175550a.
conclusions: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass
spectrometry efficient method rapid routine genotyping and
investigation outliers identified novel variation among samples. the
expected high prevalence mi(a+) phenotype observed regions. 
of potential clinical relevance region transfusion-dependent
thalassemia common, identified two rhce*02 alleles known encode an
e-variant antigen.
