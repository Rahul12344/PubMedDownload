micrornas play important regulatory role intrinsic cellular functions.
amongst lepidopteran insects, mirnas bombyx mori studied
extensively little focus spodoptera sp. present study, we
identified total 226 mirnas spodoptera frugiperda cell line sf21. of
the total, 116 mirnas well conserved within insects, like b. mori,
drosophila melanogaster tribolium castenum remaining 110 mirnas
were identified novel based comparative analysis insect mirna data
set. landscape distribution analysis based sf21 genome assembly revealed
clustering novel mirnas. total 5 mirna clusters identified and
the largest one encodes 5 mirna genes. addition, 12 mirnas validated
using northern blot analysis putative functional role assignment 6 sf
mirnas investigated examining relative abundance different
developmental stages spodoptera litura body parts 6th instar larvae.
further, identified total 809 potential target genes go terms for
selected mirnas, involved different metabolic signalling pathways the
insect. newly identified mirnas greatly enrich repertoire insect
mirnas analysis expression profiles reveal involvement various
steps biochemical pathways army worm.
