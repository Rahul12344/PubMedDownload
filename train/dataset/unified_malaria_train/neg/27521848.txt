lytic infection essential persistent infection pathogenesis of
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), inhibiting kshv lytic
replication may effectively prevent occurrence kshv-related diseases.
chloroquine (cq), well-known antimalarial drug autophagy inhibitor, exerts 
broad-spectrum antiviral effects shows anti-cancer therapeutic potential.
however, ability cq derivatives control infection oncogenic 
γ-herpesvirus remains undefined. reveal cq suppresses kshv lytic
gene expression virion production, shows cytotoxicity toward kshv
lytically infected b cells clinically acceptable doses. cq suppresses mtor and
p38-mapk pathway activation kshv lytic replication latent
infection. furthermore, cq blocks epstein-barr virus (ebv) lytic replication via 
a distinct mechanism invoked block virion production not
affect viral gene expression. results suggest cq effective
antiviral drug kshv lytic infection. findings indicate cq
treatment considered controlling kshv-related diseases,
particularly primary use co-infection kshv malaria.
