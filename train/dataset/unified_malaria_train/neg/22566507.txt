the role interleukin-10 (il-10) malaria remains poorly characterized. the
aims study investigate (i) whether genetic variants il-10 
gene influence il-10 production (ii) whether il-10 production well 
genotypes haplotypes il-10 gene young children mothers
are associated incidence clinical malaria young children. we
genotyped three il-10 single nucleotide polymorphisms 240 children their
mothers longitudinal prospective cohort assessed il-10 production 
by maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) cord blood mononuclear
cells (cbmcs). clinical episodes plasmodium falciparum malaria children
were documented second year life. polymorphism il-10 a-1082g
(gcc haplotype three snps il-10) children associated il-10
production levels cbmc cultured p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (p = 
0.043), g allele linked low il-10 production capacity. g allele
in children also significantly associated decreased risk clinical 
malaria infection second year life (p = 0.016). furthermore, il-10
levels measured maternal pbmcs cultured infected erythrocytes were
associated increased risk malaria infection young children (p <
0.001). conclusion, il-10 polymorphisms il-10 production capacity were
associated clinical malaria infections young children. high il-10
production capacity inherited parents may diminish immunological protection 
against p. falciparum infection, thereby risk increased malaria
morbidity.
