background: several insects mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, lice, and
mites known serve vectors vast number pathogens. many such
vectors hematophagous, therefore introduce pathogens directly the
host's bloodstream. importantly, capacity vectors spread disease 
can lead serious global health crises. furthermore, crop damage be
exacerbated pathogen infection increased insect foraging due recent
global warming.
methods: study categorized insect-associated damage three groups: animal
infection, plant infection, direct crop damage due insect foraging. to
manage problems, insect repellents pesticides developed,
among deet broadly used studied pest control agent. this
review discusses mode action possible mechanisms deet action,
including olfactory gustatory mechanisms central nervous system
impairment.
conclusion: protect humans malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, zika, and
filariasis, well reduce economic losses associated crop damage,
considerably efforts needed characterize interactions between
insects insect repellents/pesticides develop potent pest control
agents.
