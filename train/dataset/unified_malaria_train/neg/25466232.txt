dysregulation cytokine network severe malaria owing variations in
factors like parasite load, strains host factors well documented the
key cytokines dysregulated remain poorly elucidated. longitudinal

plasmodium falciparum malaria. found up-regulated expression tnf-α, il-1β, 
ifn-γ tgf-β sm, decreased expression il-10 0. further, we
observed negative correlation il-10 expression parasitemia and
pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting il-10 key cytokine tilting
