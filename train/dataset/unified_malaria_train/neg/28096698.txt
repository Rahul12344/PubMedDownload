about one-half burkitt lymphoma (bl) patients younger 40 years,
and one-third belong adolescent young adult (aya) subset, defined by
an age 15 25-40 years, based selection criteria used different 
reports. bl aggressive b-cell neoplasm displaying highly characteristic
clinico-diagnostic features, biologic hallmark translocation
involving immunoglobulin c-myc genes. presents sporadic, endemic, or
epidemic disease. endemicity pathogenetically linked imbalance the
immune system occurs african children infected malaria parasites 
epstein-barr virus, epidemic form strictly follows pattern of

designed short-intensive, rotational multiagent chemotherapy programs, empowered 
by anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. carefully applied with
appropriate supportive measures, modern programs achieve cure rate of
approximately 90% average aya patient, irrespective clinical stage,

underdeveloped countries, reduction diagnostic referral-for-care
