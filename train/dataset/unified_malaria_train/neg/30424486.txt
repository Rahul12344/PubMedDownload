paraquat potent superoxide (oâ‚‚-)-inducing agent capable inducing 
an oxidative imbalance mosquito midgut. oxidative imbalance can
super-stress malaria parasite, leading arrested development the
mosquito midgut reduced transmission. several studies explored the
effect paraquat malaria parasites, fundamental understanding the
mosquito response compound remains unknown. here, quantified the
mosquito midgut proteomic response paraquat-laced sugar meal, found that
an. gambiae midguts enriched proteins indicative cells 
endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress. also carried qrt-pcr analyses nine 
prominent thioredoxin (trx) glutathione (gsh)-dependent genes mosquito
midguts post p. falciparum blood meal ingestion evaluate concordance
between transcripts proteins different oxidative stress conditions. our
data revealed absence significant upregulation trx gsh-dependent
genes following infected blood meal ingestion. data suggest the
intrinsic tolerance mosquito midgut paraquat-mediated oxidative stress 
is er stress response. data indicate mosquitoes at
least two divergent pathways managing oxidative stress induced 
exogenous compounds, outline potential application paraquat-like drugs
to act selectively malaria parasite development mosquito midguts,
thereby blocking mosquito-to-human transmission.
