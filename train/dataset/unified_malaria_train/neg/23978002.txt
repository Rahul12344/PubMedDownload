background: although several studies investigated impact reduced
malaria transmission due insecticide-treated bed nets (itns) patterns
of morbidity mortality, limited information effect on
parasite diversity.
methods: sequencing used investigate effect itns polymorphisms
in two genes encoding leading plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens,
the 19 kilodalton blood stage merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1(19kda)) 
th2r th3r t-cell epitopes pre-erythrocytic stage circumsporozoite
protein (csp) large community-based itn trial site western kenya. the
number frequency haplotypes well nucleotide haplotype diversity 
were compared among parasites obtained children <5 years old prior the
introduction itns (1996) 5 years high coverage itn use (2001).
results: total 12 msp-1(19kda) haplotypes detected 1996 2001.
the q-ksng-l e-ksng-l haplotypes corresponding fvo fup strains 
p. falciparum prevalent (range 32-37%), overall haplotype
diversity > 0.7. msp-1(19kda) 3d7 sequence-types detected 1996 
the frequency less 4% 2001. csp th2r th3r domains highly
polymorphic total 26 14 haplotypes, respectively detected 1996
and 34 13 haplotypes 2001, overall haplotype diversity > 0.9
and 0.75 respectively. frequency predominant th2r th3r
haplotypes 14 36%, respectively. frequency th2r th3r
haplotypes corresponding 3d7 parasite strain less 4% time
points. significant difference nucleotide haplotype diversity
in parasite isolates collected time points.
conclusion: high diversity two genes maintained overtime
despite marked reductions malaria transmission due itns use. frequency 
of 3d7 sequence-types low area. findings provide
information could useful design future malaria vaccines for
deployment endemic areas high itn coverage interpretation of
efficacy data malaria vaccines based 3d7 parasite strains.
