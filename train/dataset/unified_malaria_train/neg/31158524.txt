developing ultrasensitive methods capable detecting submicroscopic
parasitemia-a challenge persists low transmission areas, asymptomatic
carriers, patients showing recrudescence-is vital achieving malaria
eradication. nucleic acid amplification techniques offer improved analytical
sensitivity limited number copies amplification targets.
herein, perform novel genome mining approach identify pair identical
multirepeat sequences (imrss) constitute 170 123 copies the
plasmodium falciparum genome explore potential primers pcr.
real-time quantitative pcr analyses shown ability p. falciparum imrss
to amplify low 2.54 fg p. falciparum genomic dna (approximately 0.1
parasite), striking 100-fold increase detection limit compared
with p. falciparum 18s rrna (251.4 fg; approximately 10 parasites). validation
with clinical samples malaria-endemic regions shown 6.70 ± 1.66 cycle
better detection threshold terms ct value p. falciparum imrss, with
approximately 100% sensitivity specificity. plasmodium falciparum imrs assays
are also capable detecting submicroscopic infections asymptomatic samples. 
to summarize, approach initiating amplification multiple loci across
the genome generating products increased analytical sensitivity 
different classic approaches amplifying multicopy genes tandem repeats.
this serve platform technology develop advanced diagnostics for
various pathogens.
