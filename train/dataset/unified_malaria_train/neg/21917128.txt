background: human malaria, naturally-acquired immune response result
in either elimination parasite persistent response mediated by
cytokines leads immunopathology. cytokines responsible all
the symptoms, pathological alterations outcome infection depends
on reciprocal regulation pro anti-inflammatory cytokines. il-10
and ifn-gamma able mediate process production be
affected single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) gene cytokines. in
this study, relationship cytokine il-10/ifn-gamma levels,
parasitaemia, gene polymorphisms examined participation 
pro-inflammatory regulatory balance natural immune response in
plasmodium vivax-infected individuals observed.
methods: serum levels cytokines il-4, il-12, ifn-gamma il-10 
132 patients evaluated indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(elisa). polymorphism position +874 ifn-gamma gene identified
by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (aso-pcr) method, the
polymorphism position -1082 il-10 gene analysed pcr-rflp
(pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism).
results: levels pro- (ifn-gamma) anti-inflammatory cytokine
(il-10) significantly higher p. vivax-infected individuals compared to
healthy controls. ifn-gamma levels primoinfected patients were
significantly higher patients suffered one one
previous episode. mutant alleles ifn-gamma il-10 genes 
frequent wild allele. case ifng+874 polymorphism
(ifn-gamma) frequencies mutant (a) wild (t) alleles 70.13%
and 29.87%, respectively. similar frequencies recorded il-10-1082, with
the mutant (a) allele returning frequency 70.78%, wild (g) allele 
frequency 29.22%. frequencies alleles associated reduced
production ifn-gamma il-10 high, effect only
observed production ifn-gamma.
conclusions: study shown evidence reciprocal regulation levels
of il-10 ifn-gamma cytokines p. vivax malaria, altered the
presence polymorphism il-10 gene.
