a number studies shown cd8+ cells mediate protective anti-malaria 
immunity mouse model. however, whether human cd8+ cells play role in
protection malaria remains unknown. recently established human immune 
system (his) mice harboring functional human cd8+ cells (his-cd8 mice) by
transduction hla-a∗0201 certain human cytokines using recombinant
adeno-associated virus-based gene transfer technologies. his-cd8 mice mount
a potent, antigen-specific hla-a∗0201-restricted human cd8+ t-cell response upon 
immunization recombinant adenovirus expressing human malaria antigen,
the plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (pfcsp), termed adpfcsp. in
the present study, challenged adpfcsp-immunized his-cd8 mice transgenic
plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing full-length pfcsp found that
adpfcsp-immunized (but naïve) mice protected subsequent malaria 
challenge. level hla-a∗0201-restricted, pfcsp-specific human cd8+
t-cell response closely correlated level malaria protection.
furthermore, depletion human cd8+ cells adpfcsp-immunized his-cd8 mice 
almost completely abolished anti-malaria immune response. taken together, our
data show human cd8+ cells mediate protective anti-malaria immunity in
vivo.
