objectives: interaction genetic, epigenetic inheritance and
environmental factors determines susceptibility hypertension. previous
epidemiology studies shown coke oven workers frequently exposed
to various occupational hazards remarkable increase risk for
hypertension. among many genetic variants identified hypertension, heat shock 
protein 70 (hsp70) found play important roles pathogenesis of
hypertension associated diseases. therefore explore possible role of
hsp70 polymorphisms interaction occupational environment in
hypertension risk.
methods: carried case-control study among 367 coke oven workers in
northwest china, focused three common hsp70 polymorphisms (hsp70-1 g190c,
hsp70-2 a1267g hsp70-hom t2437c), evaluated association hsp70 gene
polymorphisms work sites high risk hypertension.
results: results indicated hsp70-1 gc cc genotype 2.73-fold 
4.26-fold increased relative risk (95% ci 1.33 5.55 1.17 15.53),
respectively, comparing hsp70-1 gg genotype. hsp70-2 ag gg conferred a
47% 36% reduced risk (95% ci 0.23 0.99 0.14 0.92) comparing with
hsp70-2 aa genotype. analysis interaction hsp70 polymorphisms
with occupational environment indicated strong positive interaction between
hsp70 genotype (hsp70-1 gc+cc, hsp70-2 aa hsp70-hom tc+cc) oven top
workplace.
conclusions: collectively, data indicate hsp70 polymorphisms interact 
with occupational hazards might increase risk hypertension coke oven
workers.
