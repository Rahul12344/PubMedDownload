it known whether exposure anopheles trypanosomes influences their
fitness ability transmit plasmodium. using cell molecular biology
approaches, found trypanosoma brucei brucei parasites survive at
least 48h infectious blood meal midgut major malaria vector, 
anopheles coluzzii cleared. transient survival trypanosomes 
in midgut correlated dysbiosis, alteration abundance of
the enteric bacterial flora anopheles coluzzii. using developmental biology 
approach, found presence live trypanosomes mosquito midguts
also reduces reproductive fitness, impairs viability laid eggs
by affecting hatching. furthermore, found anopheles exposure to
trypanosomes enhances vector competence plasmodium, increases
their infection prevalence. transcriptomic analysis revealed expression of
only two anopheles immune genes modulated trypanosome exposure and
that increased susceptibility plasmodium microbiome-dependent, while
the reproductive fitness cost dependent presence live
trypanosomes microbiome independent. taken together, results
demonstrate multiple effects upon anopheles vector competence plasmodium

may turn implications malaria control strategies co-endemic areas.
