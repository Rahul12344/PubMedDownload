the concept niche partitioning received considerable theoretical attention
at interface ecology evolution infectious diseases. strain theory
postulates pathogen populations structured distinct
nonoverlapping strains frequency-dependent selection response to
intraspecific competition host immune space. malaria parasite plasmodium 
falciparum presents opportunity investigate phenomenon nature,
under conditions high recombination rate extensive antigenic diversity.
the parasite's major blood-stage antigen, pf emp1, encoded hyperdiverse
var genes. dataset includes thousands var dblα sequence types
sampled asymptomatic cases within area high endemicity ghana, we
address var diversity distributed within isolates compare 
distribution microsatellite allelic diversity within isolates test whether 
antigenic neutral regions genome structured differently. with
respect var dblα sequence types, find average isolates exhibit
significantly lower overlap expected randomly, also exists
frequent pairs isolates highly related. furthermore, linkage
network var dblα sequence types reveals pattern nonrandom modularity
unique antigenic genes, find modules highly linked dblα
types explainable neutral forces related var recombination
constraints, microsatellite diversity, sampling location, host age, or
multiplicity infection. findings reduced overlap modularity among
the var antigenic genes consistent role immune selection as
proposed strain theory. identifying evolutionary ecological dynamics
that responsible nonrandom structure p. falciparum antigenic
diversity important designing effective intervention endemic areas.
