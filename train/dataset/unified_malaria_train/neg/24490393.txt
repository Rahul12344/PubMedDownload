objective: analyze population genetic structure genetic diversity of
oncomelania hupensis population jiangxi, anhui jiangsu provinces along
the lower reaches yangzte river order explore application values
of rdna-its molecular markers surveillance snail dispersal.
methods: samples 9 species o. hupensis snails collected
separately jiangxi, anhui jiangsu provinces, genomes were
extracted, partial gene rdna-its amplified, cloned sequenced.
next, population genetic diversity parameters, including fixation index
(f(st)), genetic distance, genetic variation calculated. using the
neighbor-joining method, family map constructed based haplotype.
results: total 78 haplotypes among 93 sequences acquired 9
populations. average haplotype diversity nucleotide diversity 9
populations 0.988 0.012 88, respectively, showed genetic 
diversity level o. hupensis snail population high. variation found
mainly among samples, genetic distances populations ranged
from 0.001 6 0.002 3, showed higher degree genetic differentiation 
among snail populations. family map showed haploid types could
be divided three major branches.
conclusions: genetic diversity o. hupensis population jiangxi, anhui
and jiangsu provinces along lower reaches yangtze river mainly exists 
among individuals, obvious genetic differences among
populations. application rdna-its molecular markers surveillance of
snail dispersal worth discussing.
