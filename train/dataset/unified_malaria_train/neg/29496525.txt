malaria harmful disease affecting tropical subtropical countries
and causing sometimes fatal complications. effects malaria-related
complications intestine relatively neglected, reasons
for intestinal damage caused malaria infection yet clear. the
present study aims evaluate influence intestinal vitamin receptor 
host-pathogen interactions malaria induced mice plasmodium chabaudi.
to induce infection, animals infected 106p. chabaudi-parasitized
erythrocytes. mice sacrificed day 8 post-infection. infected mice
experienced significant body weight loss parasitaemia affecting 46%
of rbcs. infection caused marked pathological changes intestinal tissue
indicated shortening intestine villi. moreover, phagocytic
activity macrophages increased significantly (p < 0.01) infected villi 
compared non-infected ones. infection parasite also induced marked 
upregulation nuclear factor-kappa b, inducible nitric oxide synthase, vitamin 
d receptor, interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor alpha interferon
gamma-mrna. implied vitamin receptor role in
regulating malarial infection.
