culex quinquefasciatus vector diverse range vector-borne diseases
such avian malaria, west nile virus (wnv), japanese encephalitis, eastern
equine encephalitis, lymphatic filariasis, saint louis encephalitis. notably,
avian malaria played major role extinction numerous endemic
island bird species, wnv become important vector-borne disease in
the united states. gain insight c. quinquefasciatus biology and
expand genetic control toolbox, need develop efficient and
affordable methods genome engineering species. however, some
biological traits unique culex mosquitoes, particularly egg rafts, 
made difficult perform microinjection procedures required genome
engineering. address challenges, developed optimized embryo
microinjection protocol focuses mitigating technical obstacles
associated unique characteristics culex mosquitoes. procedures 
demonstrate optimized methods egg collection, egg raft separation other
handling procedures essential successful microinjection c.
quinquefasciatus. coupled crispr/cas9 genome editing technology,
these procedures allow us achieve site-specific, efficient heritable
germline mutations, required perform advanced genome engineering and
develop genetic control technologies important, currently
understudied, disease vector.
