gene manipulation invaluable tool investigate understand biology
of organism. although technology applied human and
rodent malarial parasites (rmp), plasmodium berghei particular offers more
robust system due higher efficient transformation rate. here, we
describe comprehensive transfection selection protocol using p. berghei
including variant negative selection protocol administering 5-fluorocytosine to
the animals drinking water. additionally, discuss assess latest
advances gene manipulation technologies developed rmp gain better
understanding plasmodium biology.
