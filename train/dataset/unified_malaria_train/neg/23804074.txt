thiamine metabolized essential cofactor several enzymes. we
show oxythiamine, thiamine analog, inhibits proliferation malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum vitro via thiamine-related pathway and
significantly reduces parasite growth mouse malaria model. overexpression of
thiamine pyrophosphokinase (the enzyme converts thiamine active
form, thiamine pyrophosphate) hypersensitizes parasites oxythiamine to
1,700-fold, consistent oxythiamine substrate thiamine
pyrophosphokinase conversion antimetabolite. show that
parasites overexpressing thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase 15-fold more
resistant oxythiamine, consistent antimetabolite inactivating
thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes. studies therefore validate thiamine
utilization antimalarial drug target demonstrate single
antimalarial simultaneously target several enzymes located within distinct
organelles.
