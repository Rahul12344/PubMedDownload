acquired antibodies directed towards antigens expressed surface of
merozoites infected erythrocytes play important role protective
immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria. p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1), major parasite component infected erythrocyte
surface, implicated malaria pathology, parasite sequestration and
host immune evasion. however, extent unique pfemp1 domains interact 
with host immune response remains largely unknown. study, sought to
comprehensively understand naturally acquired antibody responses targeting
different duffy binding-like (dbl), cysteine-rich interdomain region (cidr)
domains ugandan cohort. consequently, created protein library
consisting full-length dbl (n = 163) cidr (n = 108) domains derived from
62-var genes based 3d7 genome. proteins expressed wheat germ
cell-free system; system yields plasmodial proteins comparatively
soluble, intact, biologically active immunoreactive human sera. our
findings suggest pfemp1 dbl cidr domains, regardless pfemp1
group, targets naturally acquired immunity. breadth immune
response expands children's age. concurrently identified 10 dbl 8
cidr domains whose antibody responses associated reduced risk to
symptomatic malaria ugandan children cohort. study highlights that
only restricted set specific domains essential eliciting naturally
acquired protective immunity malaria. light current data, tandem domains
in pfemp1s pf3d7_0700100 pf3d7_0425800 (dc4) recommended extensive
evaluation larger population cohorts assess potential as
alternative targets malaria vaccine development.
