persistent insecticides sprayed onto house walls, incorporated into
insecticide-treated bednets, provide long-acting, cost-effective control of
vector-borne diseases malaria leishmaniasis. high concentrations 
that occur immediately postdeployment may kill resistant susceptible
insects. however, insecticide concentration, therefore killing ability,
declines months deployment. concentrations decline, resistant
insects start survive, susceptible insects still killed. period 
of time deployment, within mortality resistant individuals 
lower susceptible ones, termed "window selection" in
other contexts. recognized driving resistance bacteria malaria
parasites, predominantly haploid. argue paying more
attention mortality differences help understand evolution of
insecticide resistance. insects diploid, resistance encoded single
genes generates heterozygotes. gives potential narrower "window of
dominance," within window selection, heterozygote mortality lower
than susceptible homozygotes. explore general properties of
windows selection dominance driving resistance. quantify their
likely effect using data new laboratory experiments published data 
the laboratory field. windows persist months years after
insecticide deployments. differential mortalities resistant, susceptible and
heterozygous genotypes, public health deployments, constitute major
challenge controlling resistance. greater attention mortality differences
by genotype would inform strategies reduce evolution resistance to
existing new insecticides.
