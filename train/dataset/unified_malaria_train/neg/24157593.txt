evolution spread chloroquine resistant (cqr) malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum posed great threat malaria intervention across globe. 
occurrence k76t mutation p. falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt) gene widely attributed cqr four neighboring 
mutations providing compensatory fitness benefit parasite survival.
understanding evolutionary patterns pfcrt gene great relevance not
only devising new malaria control measures also could serve model to
understand evolution spread human drug-resistant pathogens. several 
studies, mainly based differential patterns diversities the
microsatellite loci placed in-and-around pfcrt gene indicated role
of positive natural selection 'hitchhiking' model molecular
evolution. however, studies restricted limited number of
microsatellite loci present inside pfcrt gene. moreover, comparatively higher
level diversities microsatellite loci present inside pfcrt gene than
the loci flanking pfcrt gene hallmarks indian p. falciparum,
presenting contrasting evolutionary models global isolates. view to
infer evolutionary patterns pfcrt gene indian p. falciparum, have
adopted unique sampling scheme two types populations (cultured field 
collected) utilized 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci (16 located inside the
pfcrt gene four two flanking regions) disentangle genetic
drift (inbred cultured isolates) natural selection (field isolates). data
analyses employing different population genetic tests could straightforwardly
explain either model invoking 'genetic hitchhiking' 'genetic drift'.
however, complex evolutionary models influenced demography natural
selection alternative model natural selection (e.g.
diversifying/balancing selection) might better explain observed
microsatellite variation in-and-around pfcrt gene indian p. falciparum.
