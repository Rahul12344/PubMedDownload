serpentine receptors (srs) transmembrane proteins generally acting as
mediators facilitate communication cell environment. 
least six putative sr-like proteins encoded genome malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum. two them, roles cell stress control
were reported; however, sr-like proteins functions not
yet known. study, provide first phenotypic analysis the
plasmodial sr10. transmembrane protein expressed asexual sexual
blood stages p. falciparum. co-localization co-immunoprecipitation assays 
demonstrated association sr10 endoplasmic reticulum protein erc.
gene disruption sr10 leads impaired intraerythrocytic replication and
strongly reduces gametocyte numbers. thus propose sr10 protein
associated endoplasmic reticulum important functions for
asexual sexual blood stage development.
