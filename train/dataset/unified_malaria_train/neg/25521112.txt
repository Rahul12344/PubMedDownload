the polymorphic gene family p. falciparum âˆ¼60 var genes
distributed across parasite chromosomes, subtelomeres internal
regions. encode hypervariable surface proteins known p. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) critical pathogenesis and
immune evasion plasmodium falciparum. var gene sequence diversity is
generated currently completely understood. address this, constructed
large clone trees performed whole genome sequence analysis study the
generation novel var gene sequences asexually replicating parasites. 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) scattered across genome,
structural variants (deletions, duplications, translocations) focused and
around var genes, considerable variation frequency strains.
analysis 100 recombination events involving var exon 1 revealed that
the average nucleotide sequence identity two recombining exons 63%
(range: 52.7-72.4%) yet crossovers error-free occurred way
that resulting sequence frame domain architecture preserved.
var exon 1, encodes immunologically exposed part protein,
recombined 0.2% infected erythrocytes vitro per life cycle. the
high rate var exon 1 recombination indicates millions new antigenic
structures could potentially generated day single infected
individual. propose model whereby var gene sequence polymorphism mainly
generated asexual part life cycle.
