enteric coinfections among children low-income countries common, 
it well known specific pathogen combinations associated have
clinical importance. analysis, feces samples children rwanda 
zanzibar less 5 years age, (n = 994) without (n = 324) acute
diarrhea, analyzed real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting wide
range pathogens. associations investigated comparing co-detection 
mono-detection frequencies pairwise pathogen combinations. one 
pathogen detected 840 samples (65%). negative association (coinfections 
being less common expected probability) observed rotavirus in
combination shigella, campylobacter, norovirus genogroup ii, 
patients, statistically expected agents independently cause
diarrhea. positive correlation observed, patients controls,
between ct (threshold cycle) values certain virulence factor genes in
enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (eae bfpa) toxin genes in
enterotoxigenic e. coli (eltb esta), allowing estimation often these
genes present bacteria. significant positive association in
patients observed shigella epec-eae, suggesting this
coinfection might interact manner enhances symptoms. although
interaction pathogens affect symptoms rare, work emphasizes 
the importance difference interpretation coinfections depending on
whether positively negatively associated.
