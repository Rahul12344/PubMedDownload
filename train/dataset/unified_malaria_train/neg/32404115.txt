background: leishmania donovani-induced sand fly-transmitted leishmaniasis is
a growing health problem sri lanka. limited knowledge biological and
behavioral characteristics probable vector phlebotomus argentipes hinders
disease control. here, insecticide susceptibility patterns p. argentipes 
investigated exploration probable underlying resistance mechanisms.
methods: adult sand flies collected using standard cattle baited net traps
and cdc light traps selected sites four districts. adult f1 progeny p.
argentipes exposed different concentrations ddt, malathion,
deltamethrin propoxur using susceptibility bioassay kits. post-1-h
knockdown post-24-h mortality recorded analyzed. metabolic enzyme
activity sensitivity acetylcholinesterase target-site were
determined biochemical assays using wild-caught flies. extracted fly dna
samples tested presence knockdown-resistance (kdr) type
mutations.
results: lc100 values ddt, malathion, propoxur deltamethrin were
0.8-1.5%, 0.9-2.0%, 0.017-0.03% 0.007% respectively.
insecticide-susceptibility levels higher discriminating dosages
established aedes mosquitoes, except malathion. lowest susceptibility
levels (except deltamethrin) detected mamadala population,
whereas highest levels detected mirigama population. the
percentage knocked-down sand flies < 75% tested concentration,
including those, exhibited 100% mortality 24 h. elevated activity
levels glutathione s-transferase (3%, 7%, 12.5% 14%) esterase (2%, 5%,
5.5% 6.5%) detected flies originated mirigama, pannala,
thalawa mamadala respectively, monooxygenase quantities remained 
the cut-off level. ten 34.5% flies heterozygous for
acetylcholinesterases target-site insensitivity, associated organophosphate 
and carbamate resistance. pyrethroid-resistance-associated l1014f kdr-type
mutation voltage gated sodium channel gene detected 30/53 flies.
conclusions: populations p. argentipes sri lanka largely susceptible to
common insecticides, except malathion (used extensively past for
malaria control). insecticide susceptibility appears negatively associated 
with past malaria endemicity study sites, signs early insecticide 
tolerance. presence insecticide target site insensitivity notable
proportion flies enhanced insecticide metabolizing enzyme activities imply
potential future challenges leishmaniasis control, call urgent
proactive measures containment.
