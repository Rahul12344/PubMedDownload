malaria parasites harbour two organelles bacteria-like metabolic processes
that targets many anti-bacterial drugs. one drug fusidic acid,
which inhibits translation component elongation factor g. response p. 
falciparum fusidic acid characterised using extended sybr-green based drug
trials. revealed fusidic acid kills vitro cultured p. falciparum
parasites immediately blocking parasite development. two bacterial-type
protein translation elongation factor g genes identified likely targets of
fusidic acid. sequence analysis suggests proteins function the
mitochondria apicoplast sensitive fusidic acid.
microscopic examination protein-reporter fusions confirm prediction that
one elongation factor g component parasite mitochondria whereas the
second component relict plastid apicoplast. presence two
putative targets single inhibitory compound emphasizes potential of
elongation factor g drug target malaria.
