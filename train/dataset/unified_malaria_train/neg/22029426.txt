background: genome-wide experiments annotations become prevalent,
researchers increasingly require tools help interpret data scale. many
functional genomics experiments involve partitioning genome labeled
segments, segments sharing label exhibit one more
biochemical functional traits. example, collection chlp-seq
experiments yields compendium peaks, labeled one more
associated dna-binding proteins. similarly, manually automatically generated
annotations functional genomic elements, including cis-regulatory modules 
protein-coding rna genes, also summarized genomic segmentations.
results: present software toolkit called segtools simplifies and
automates exploration genomic segmentations. software operates a
series interacting tools, provides one mode summarization.
these various tools pipelined summarized single html page. we
describe segtools toolkit demonstrate use interpreting a
collection human histone modification data sets plasmodium falciparum
local chromatin structure data sets.
conclusions: segtools provides convenient, powerful means interpreting a
genomic segmentation.
