in 2006, senegal adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) as
first-line treatment management uncomplicated malaria. study aimed
to update status antimalarial efficacy ten years their
first introduction. randomized, three-arm, open-label study to
evaluate efficacy safety artemether-lumefantrine (al),
artesunate-amodiaquine (asaq) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) senegal.
malaria suspected patients screened, enrolled, treated, followed 28 
days al asaq arms 42 days dp arm. clinical parasitological
responses assessed following antimalarial treatment. genotyping (msp1, msp2 
and 24 snp-based barcode) done differentiate recrudescence from
re-infection; case pcr-confirmed treatment failure, pfk13 propeller and
pfcoronin genes sequenced. data entered analyzed using who
excel-based application. total 496 patients enrolled. diourbel, pcr 
non-corrected/corrected adequate clinical parasitological responses (acpr)
was 100.0% al asaq arms. kedougou, pcr corrected acpr values
were 98.8%, 100% 97.6% al, asaq dp arms respectively. pfk13 or
pfcoronin mutations associated artemisinin resistance found. study
showed al, asaq dp remain efficacious well-tolerated the
treatment uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria senegal.
