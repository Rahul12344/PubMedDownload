background: although rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) plasmodium falciparum
infection target histidine rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) generally sensitive, 
their performance reported variable. one possible explanation 
variable test performance differences expression level pfhrp in
different parasite isolates.
methods: total rna protein extracted synchronised cultures 7 p. 
falciparum lines 5 time points life cycle, synchronised ring
stages 10 falciparum lines. using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction, western blot analysis elisa investigated variations the
transcription protein levels pfhrp2, pfhrp3 pfhrp respectively 
different parasite lines, parasite intraerythrocytic life cycle.
results: transcription pfhrp2 pfhrp3 different parasite lines 
parasite life cycle observed vary relative control parasite k1. 
some parasite lines low transcription genes observed. peak 
transcription observed ring-stage parasites. pfhrp2 transcription was
observed consistently higher pfhrp3 transcription within parasite
lines. intraerythrocytic lifecycle stage peak level protein
was present varied across strains. total protein levels constant
relative total mrna transcription, however maximum 24 fold difference in
expression ring-stage parasites relative k1 strain observed.
conclusions: levels transcription pfhrp2 pfhrp3, protein
expression pfhrp varied different p. falciparum strains. this
variation may impact detection sensitivity pfhrp2-detecting rdts.
