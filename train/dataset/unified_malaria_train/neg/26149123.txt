our understanding key phosphorylation-dependent signalling pathways the
human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, remains rudimentary. we
address issue essential cgmp-dependent protein kinase, pfpkg. by
employing chemical genetic tools combination quantitative global
phosphoproteomics, identify phosphorylation sites 69 proteins 
direct indirect cellular targets pfpkg. pfpkg targets include
proteins involved cell signalling, proteolysis, gene regulation, protein
export ion protein transport, indicating cgmp/pfpkg acts a
signalling hub plays central role number core parasite processes. 
we also show pfpkg activity required parasite invasion. this
correlates finding calcium-dependent protein kinase, pfcdpk1,
is phosphorylated pfpkg, components actomyosin complex,
providing mechanistic insight essential role pfpkg parasite egress
and invasion.
