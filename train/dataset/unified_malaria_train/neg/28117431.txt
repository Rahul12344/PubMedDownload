cultured human pathogens may differ significantly source populations. to
investigate genetic basis laboratory adaptation malaria parasites,
clinical plasmodium falciparum isolates sampled patients cultured
in vitro three months. genome sequence analysis performed on
multiple culture time point samples six monoclonal isolates, single
nucleotide polymorphism (snp) variants emerging time detected. a
total five positively selected snps, four represented nonsense mutations
resulting stop codons, three single apiap2 transcription factor 
gene, one srpk1. survey nonsense mutants associated with
culture, genome sequences eleven long-term laboratory-adapted parasite strains
were examined, revealing four independently acquired nonsense mutations two
other apiap2 genes, five epac. mutants genes exist large 
database parasite sequences uncultured clinical samples. implicates 
putative master regulator genes multiple independent stop codon
mutations convergently led culture adaptation, affecting laboratory 
lines p. falciparum. understanding adaptive processes guide
development experimental models, could include targeted gene disruption 
to adapt fastidious malaria parasite species culture.
