severe malaria caused apicomplexan parasite plasmodium falciparum, 
results significant global morbidity mortality, particularly among young
children pregnant women. p. falciparum exclusively infects human erythrocytes
during clinical illness, several natural erythrocyte polymorphisms are
protective severe malaria. since erythrocytes enucleated lack
dna, genetic approaches understand erythrocyte determinants malaria
infection historically limited. review highlights recent advances 
in use hematopoietic stem cells facilitate genetic screening for
malaria host factors. challenges still exist, approach holds promise
for gaining new insights host-pathogen interactions malaria.
