experiments demonstrating feasibility genetically modifying mosquito
vectors impair ability transmit malaria parasite known 
for well decade. however, means spread resistance population control
genes wild mosquito populations remains unsolved challenge. two recent
reports give hope crispr technology may allow challenge overcome.
