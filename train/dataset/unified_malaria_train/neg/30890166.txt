background: cytauxzoon felis tick-transmitted apicomplexan causes
cytauxzoonosis domestic cats (felis catus). even intensive care, the
mortality rate acute cytauxzoonosis approaches 40% domestic cats, while
bobcats (lynx rufus), natural intermediate host c. felis, remain
clinically asymptomatic. however, multiple reports domestic cats surviving
acute disease without treatment exist. one hypothesis survival these
cats infection unique c. felis genotypes lower pathogenicity. prior
studies identified genetically distinct c. felis isolates containing
polymorphisms within internal transcribed spacer regions (its) rrna
operon. however, polymorphisms correlate clinical outcome
of cytauxzoonosis, additional genetic markers needed test this
hypothesis. selected c. felis apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1) potential 
genetic marker differential pathogenicity. ama1 vaccine candidate for
relatives c. felis within plasmodium spp.; however historically high level
of genetic polymorphism resulted escape vaccine-induced immunity.
while diversity hindered vaccine development, expected polymorphism 
within the ama1 gene may useful evaluate population genetics.
results: 677 bp sequence c. felis ama1 gene pcr-amplified 84
domestic cats 9 bobcats demonstrated 99.9% sequence identity across all
samples. single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) identified domestic cats
and bobcats evidence co-infection genotypes identified two 
domestic cats. prevalence two genotypes varied geographical
distribution domestic cats. nucleotide diversity (π) haplotype diversity
(h) calculated c. felis ama1 ama1 related apicomplexans assess
genetic diversity. based values (π = 0.00067 h = 0.457), the
diversity c. felis ama1 gene region analyzed considerably lower than
what documented related apicomplexans.
conclusions: surprising contrast related apicomplexans, results support
that sequence c. felis ama1 gene highly conserved. lack of
genetic diversity limits utility c. felis ama1 genetic marker for
clinical outcome, supports investigation vaccine candidate for
cytauxzoonosis.
