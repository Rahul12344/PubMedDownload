many important infectious diseases result zoonoses, pathogens
that normally infect animals acquire mutations enable breaching of
species barriers permit infection humans. understanding the
molecular events enable host switching often limited, yet 
fundamentally important question. plasmodium falciparum, etiological agent of
severe human malaria, evolved following zoonotic transfer parasites from
gorillas. one gene-rh5-which encodes essential ligand invasion host
erythrocytes, suspected played critical role host switch.
genome comparisons revealed introgressed sequence ancestor p.
falciparum containing rh5, likely allowed ancestral parasites infect
both gorilla human erythrocytes. test hypothesis, resurrected 
ancestral introgressed reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (rh5) sequence
and used quantitative protein interaction assays demonstrate this
ancestral protein could bind basigin receptor humans gorillas. 
we also showed promiscuous receptor binding phenotype rh5 shared
with parasite clade transferred genome segment ancestor p.
falciparum, lineages exhibit host-specific receptor binding,
confirming central importance introgression event plasmodium host
switching. finally, since transfer humans, p. falciparum, also rh5
ligand, evolved strong human specificity. show subsequent
restriction humans attributed single amino acid mutation the
rh5 sequence. findings reveal molecular pathway origin and
evolution human p. falciparum malaria may inform molecular surveillance to
predict future zoonoses.
