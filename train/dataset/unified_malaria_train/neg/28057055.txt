background: plasmodium ookinete surface proteins post-fertilization target
antigens potential malaria transmission-blocking vaccine (tbv) candidates.
putative secreted ookinete protein 25 (psop25) highly conserved ookinete
surface protein, shown promising novel tbv target. here, 
further investigated tbv activities full-length recombinant psop25
(rpsop25) protein plasmodium berghei, characterized potential
functions psop25 p. berghei life-cycle.
methods: expressed full-length p. berghei psop25 protein prokaryotic 
expression system, developed polyclonal mouse antisera monoclonal
antibody (mab) recombinant protein. indirect immunofluorescence assay
(ifa) western blot used test specificity antibodies. the
transmission-blocking (tb) activities antibodies evaluated in
vitro ookinete conversion assay direct mosquito feeding assay (dfa).
finally, function psop25 plasmodium development studied by
deleting psop25 gene.
results: polyclonal mouse antisera anti-rpsop25 mab recognized the
psop25 proteins parasites, ifa showed preferential expression of
psop25 surface zygotes, retorts mature ookinetes. vitro, these
antibodies significantly inhibited ookinetes formation antibody
concentration-dependent manner. dfa, mice immunized rpsop25 those
receiving passive transfer anti-rpsop25 mab reduced prevalence of
mosquito infection 31.2 26.1%, oocyst density 66.3 63.3%,
respectively. genetic knockout psop25 gene detectable
impact asexual growth p. berghei, significantly affected the
maturation ookinetes formation midgut oocysts.
conclusions: full-length rpsop25 could elicit strong antibody response in
mice. polyclonal monoclonal antibodies psop25 could effectively block
the formation ookinetes vitro transmission parasites to
mosquitoes. genetic manipulation study indicated psop25 required for
ookinete maturation p. berghei. results support testing the
psop25 orthologs human malaria parasites promising tbv candidates.
