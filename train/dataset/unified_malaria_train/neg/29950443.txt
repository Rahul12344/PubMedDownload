the pathogenesis infectious diseases depends interaction host and
pathogen. plasmodium falciparum malaria, host parasite processes be
assessed dual rna sequencing blood infected patients. performed
dual transcriptome analyses samples 46 malaria-infected gambian children 
to reveal mechanisms driving systemic pathophysiology severe malaria.
integrating transcriptomic data estimates parasite load and
detailed clinical information allowed consideration potentially confounding
effects due differing leukocyte proportions blood, parasite developmental
stage, whole-body pathogen load. report hundreds human parasite
genes differentially expressed severe uncomplicated malaria, with
distinct profiles associated coma, hyperlactatemia, thrombocytopenia.
high expression neutrophil granule-related genes consistently associated
with severe malaria phenotypes. observed severity-associated variation 
the expression parasite genes, determine cytoadhesion vascular
endothelium, rigidity infected erythrocytes, parasite growth rate. to
99% human differential gene expression severe malaria driven by
differences parasite load, whereas parasite gene expression showed little
association parasite load. coexpression analyses revealed interactions
between human p. falciparum, prominent co-regulation translation
genes severe malaria host parasite. multivariate analyses
suggested increased expression granulopoiesis interferon-γ-related
genes, together inadequate suppression type 1 interferon signaling, best 
explained severity infection. findings provide framework for
understanding contributions host parasite pathogenesis of
severe malaria identifying new treatments.
