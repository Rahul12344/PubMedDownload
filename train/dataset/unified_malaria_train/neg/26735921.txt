plasmodium salivary sporozoites infectious form malaria parasite
and dormant inside salivary glands anopheles mosquitoes. dormancy, 
protein translation inhibited kinase uis1 phosphorylates serine 59
in eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eif2α). de-phosphorylation eif2α-p 
required transformation sporozoites liver stage. mammalian
cells, de-phosphorylation eif2α-p mediated protein phosphatase 1
(pp1). using series genetically knockout parasites showed malaria
sporozoites, contrary mammalian cells, eif2α-p phosphatase member 
the pp2c/ppm phosphatase family termed uis2. found eif2α highly
phosphorylated uis2 conditional knockout sporozoites. mutant sporozoites
maintained crescent shape delivery mammalian host lost their
infectivity. uis1 uis2 highly transcribed salivary gland
sporozoites uis2 expression inhibited pumilio protein puf2. the
repression uis2 expression alleviated sporozoites developed into
liver stage. eukaryotic phosphatases interact transiently their
substrates, uis2 stably bound phosphorylated eif2α, raising possibility
that high-throughput searches may identify chemicals disrupt this
interaction prevent malaria infection.
