malaria parasites grow within vertebrate erythrocytes increase host cell
permeability access nutrients plasma. increase mediated the
plasmodial surface anion channel (psac), unusual ion channel linked the
conserved clag gene family. although psac recognizes transports broad range
of uncharged charged solutes, must efficiently exclude small na(+) ion
to maintain infected cell osmotic stability. here, examine possible mechanisms
for remarkable solute selectivity. identify guanidinium organic
cation high permeability human erythrocytes infected plasmodium
falciparum, negligible uptake uninfected cells. transport characteristics 
and pharmacology indicate uptake specifically mediated psac. 
rank order organic inorganic cation permeabilities suggests cation
dehydration rate-limiting step transport channel. high 
guanidinium permeability infected cells also allows rapid stringent
synchronization parasite cultures, required molecular cellular
studies pathogen. studies provide important insights how
nutrients ions transported via psac, established target for
antimalarial drug development.
