anopheles gambiae mosquitoes major african vectors malaria, disease that
kills 600,000 people every year. given spread insecticide
resistance natural mosquito populations, alternative vector control strategies
aimed reducing reproductive success mosquitoes promoted.
unlike many insects, an. gambiae females mate single time lives 
and must use sperm stored sperm storage organ, spermatheca, to
fertilize lifetime's supply eggs. maintenance sperm viability during
storage therefore crucial reproductive capacity mosquitoes.
however, date, information available factors mechanisms
ensuring sperm functionality spermatheca. identify cellular
components molecular mechanisms used an. gambiae females maximize their
fertility. pathways energy metabolism, cellular transport, oxidative
stress strongly regulated mating spermatheca. identify the
mating-induced heme peroxidase (hpx) 15 important factor long-term
fertility, demonstrate function required multiple
gonotrophic cycles. find hpx15 induction regulated sexually
transferred 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20e), steroid hormone produced 
male accessory glands transferred copulation, expression of
this peroxidase mediated via 20e nuclear receptor. knowledge, our
findings provide first evidence mechanisms regulating fertility in
anopheles, identify hpx15 target vector control.
