the key targets protective antibodies plasmodium falciparum remain
largely unknown. study, determined immunoreactivity 1827
recombinant proteins derived 1565 genes representing ∼30% entire p.
falciparum genome, identification novel malaria vaccine candidates. the
recombinant proteins expressed wheat germ cell-free system, platform
that synthesize quality plasmodial proteins elicit biologically active
antibodies animals. sera obtained indigenous residents malaria 
endemic region northern uganda enrolled start rainy
season prospectively monitored symptomatic malaria episodes year.
immunoreactivity sera determined alphascreen; homogeneous
high-throughput system detects protein interactions. analysis revealed
antibody responses 128 proteins significantly associated protection 
from symptomatic malaria. 128 proteins, 53 down-selected most
plausible targets host protective immune response virtue a
predicted signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain(s), confirmed
localization parasite surface. 53 proteins comprised only
previously characterized vaccine candidates also uncharacterized proteins.
proteins involved erythrocyte invasion; ron4, ron2 clag3.1 and
pre-erythrocytic proteins; siap-2, trap celtos, recommended for
prioritization evaluation vaccine candidates. findings clearly
demonstrate generation protein library using wheat germ cell-free
system coupled high throughput immunoscreening alphascreen offers new
options rational discovery selection potential malaria vaccine
