although many theoretical models sympatric speciation propose genes
responsible assortative mating amongst incipient species associated
with genomic regions protected recombination, data support 
this theory. malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, known sympatric 
cryptic species maintained pre-mating reproductive isolation putative 
genomic islands speciation, therefore ideal model system for
studying genomic signature associated incipient sympatric speciation.
here selectively introgressed island divergence located the
pericentric region x chromosome an. gambiae s.s. sister taxon 
an. coluzzii 5 generations backcrossing followed two generations of
crosses within introgressed strains resulted an. coluzzii-like
recombinant strains fixed marker x chromosome island. 
mating preference recombinant strains tested giving virgin
recombinant individuals choice mates x-islands matching and
non-matching island type. show genetic analyses of
transferred sperm recombinant females consistently mated matching
island-type males thereby associating assortative mating genes x-island 
of divergence. furthermore, full-genome sequencing confirmed protein-coding 
differences recombinant strains limited experimentally
swapped pericentromeric region. finally, targeted-genome comparisons showed 
a number unique differences conserved sympatric field
populations, thereby revealing candidate speciation genes. functional
demonstration close association speciation genes x-island of
differentiation lends unprecedented support island-of-speciation models of
sympatric speciation facilitated pericentric recombination suppression.
