many pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa achieve chronic infection through
an immune evasion strategy known antigenic variation. human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, involves transcriptional switching among
members var gene family, causing parasites different antigenic and
phenotypic characteristics appear different times within population. here
we use genome-wide approach explore process vitro within set of
cloned parasite populations. analyses reveal non-random, highly structured 
switch pathway initially dominant transcript switches via set of
switch-intermediates either new dominant transcript, back the
original. show specific pathway arise evolutionary
conflict pathogen optimise safeguarding limited
antigenic repertoire remaining capable establishing infections in
non-na√Øve individuals. results thus demonstrate crucial role structured
switching early phases infections provide unifying theory 
antigenic variation p. falciparum malaria balanced process of
parasite-intrinsic switching immune-mediated selection.
