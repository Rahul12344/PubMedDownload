background: members anopheles punctulatus group (ap group) primary
vectors human malaria papua new guinea. ap group includes 13 sibling
species, morphologically indistinguishable. understanding only
certain species able transmit malaria requires better comprehension of
their evolutionary history. particular, understanding relationships and
divergence times among anopheles species may enable assessing malaria-related
traits (e.g. blood feeding behaviours, vector competence) evolved.
methods: dna sequences 14 mitochondrial (mt) genomes five ap sibling
species two species anopheles dirus complex southeast asia were
sequenced. dna sequences concatenated protein coding genes (10,770 bp)
were analysed using bayesian approach reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships date divergence ap sibling species.
results: phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated dna sequence all
mitochondrial protein coding genes indicates ancestors ap group
arrived papua new guinea 25 54 million years ago rapidly diverged to
form current sibling species.
conclusion: evaluation newly described mt genome sequences, study
has revealed divergence among members ap group papua new guinea 
would significantly predate arrival humans region, 50 thousand
years ago. divergence observed among mtdna sequences studied may
have resulted reproductive isolation historical changes sea-level 
through glacial minima maxima. leads hypothesis ap sibling
species evolved independently potentially thousands generations. this
suggests evolution many phenotypes, insecticide resistance
will arise independently ap sibling species studied here.
