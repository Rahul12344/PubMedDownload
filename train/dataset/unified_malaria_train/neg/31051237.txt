cuticular hydrocarbon (chc) biosynthesis major pathway insect physiology.
in drosophila melanogaster cytochrome p450 cyp4g1 catalyses the
insect-specific oxidative decarbonylation step, malaria vector
anopheles gambiae, two cyp4g paralogues, cyp4g16 cyp4g17 present.
analysis subcellular localization cyp4g17 cyp4g16 larval and
pupal stages revealed cyp4g16 preserves pm localization across
developmental stages analyzed; however cypg17 differentially localized two 
distinct types pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes larval adult
developmental specificity. western blot analysis showed presence two
cyp4g17 forms, potentially associated oenocyte type. an. gambiae
cyp4gs expressed d. melanogaster flies cyp4g1 silenced background in
order functionally characterize vivo. cyp4g16, cyp4g17 their
combination rescued lethal phenotype cyp4g1-knock flies,
demonstrating cyp4g17 also functional decarbonylase, albeit somewhat
lower efficiency cyp4g16 drosophila. flies expressing mosquito cyp4g16
and/or cyp4g17 produced similar chc profiles 'wild-type' flies expressing 
endogenous cyp4g1, also produce long-chain dimethyl-branched chcs
not detectable wild type flies, suggesting specificity cyp4g
enzymes contributes determine complexity chc blend. conclusion, 
both an. gambiae cyp4g enzymes contribute unique anopheles chc profile,
which associated defense, adult desiccation tolerance, insecticide
penetration rate chemical communication.
