we characterize prevalence, distribution, divergence, putative functions 
of detectable two-copy paralogs segmental duplications apicomplexa, 
phylum parasitic protists. apicomplexans mostly obligate intracellular
parasites responsible human animal diseases (e.g. malaria and
toxoplasmosis). gene loss major force phylum. genomes small and
protein-encoding gene repertoires reduced. despite genomic streamlining,
duplications gene family amplifications present. potential for
innovation introduced duplications particular interest. compared
genomes twelve apicomplexans across four lineages used orthology and
genome cartography map distributions duplications genome
architectures. segmental duplications appear limited five species. where
present, correspond regions enriched multi-copy species-specific 
genes, pointing toward roles adaptation innovation. found phylum-wide
association duplications dynamic chromosome regions syntenic
breakpoints. trends distribution duplicated genes indicate recent,
species-specific duplicates often tandem others been
dispersed genome rearrangements. trends show relationship between
genome architecture gene duplication. functional analysis reveals: proteases,
which vital parasitic lifecycle, prominent putative recent
duplications; pair paralogous genes toxoplasma gondii previously shown to
produce rate-limiting step dopamine synthesis mammalian cells, a
possible link modification host behavior; phylum-wide differences
in expression subcellular localization, indicative modes divergence. we
have uncovered trends multiple modes duplicate divergence including
sequence, intron content, expression, subcellular localization, functions 
putative recent duplicates highlight role duplications the
continuum forces shaped genomes.
