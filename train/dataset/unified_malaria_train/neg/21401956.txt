background: rhoptries specialized organelles parasites belonging 
phylum apicomplexa; secrete protein content invasion host
target cells sorted discrete subcompartments within rhoptry neck 
bulb. distribution associated proteins' role tight junction
(tj) parasitophorous vacuole (pv) formation, respectively.
methods: plasmodium falciparum ron2 amino acid sequence used bait for
screening codifying gene homologous protein plasmodium vivax
genome. gene synteny, well identity similarity values, determined 
for ron2 flanking genes among p. falciparum, p. vivax malarial 
parasite genomes available plasmodb sanger institute databases. pvron2
gene transcription determined rt-pcr cdna obtained p. vivax
vcg-1 strain. protein expression localization assessed western blot
and immunofluorescence using polyclonal anti-pvron2 antibodies. co-localization
was confirmed using antibodies directed towards specific microneme rhoptry
neck proteins.
results discussion: first p. vivax rhoptry neck protein (named here
pvron2) identified study. pvron2 2,204 residue-long protein
encoded single 6,615 bp exon containing hydrophobic signal sequence
towards amino-terminus, transmembrane domain towards carboxy-terminus
and two coiled coil α-helical motifs; characteristic features of
several previously described vaccine candidates malaria. protein
also contains two tandem repeats within interspecies variable sequence
possibly involved evading host's immune system. pvron2 expressed late 
schizonts localized rhoptry necks similar reported for
pfron2, suggests participation target cell invasion.
conclusions: identification partial characterization first p.
vivax rhoptry neck protein described present study. protein is
homologous pfron2 previously shown associated with
pfama-1, suggesting similar role pvron2.
