attending malaria clinic ranong province, thailand, located near myanmar
border investigated p. knowlesi using nested pcr assays. positive

the gene encoding circumsporozoite protein (csp).
results: two samples, one obtained thai myanmese, were
positive p. knowlesi only. nucleotide sequences csp gene derived
