between 2012 2016, 80% registered malaria cases anhui province
were plasmodium falciparum returned africa. however, drug-resistance marker 
polymorphisms imported p. falciparum cases assessed. study 
looked distribution antimalarial-drug resistance evaluating
k13-propeller, pfmdr1, pfcrt gene mutations. fourteen synonymous 15
nonsynonymous mutations k13-propeller gene detected samples from
nine african countries, yet candidate validated k13 resistance mutations
were found. prevalence pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y mutants 27.7% and
19.9%, respectively. six different pfcrt genotypes found, with
c72v73m74n75t76 common (89.2%). pfcrt 76-pfmdr1 86 haplotype
combination evaluated 173 isolates, n86t76 genotype most
prevalent (50.3%). notably, prevalence n86y mutation africa marked 
a decline 31.0% 2012 8.2% 2016. findings suggest 
no immediate threat artemisinin efficacy imported p. falciparum infections 
returned africa anhui province. nevertheless, pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y 
mutations modestly prevalent, suggesting presence chloroquine
resistance cases. accordingly, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine may a
better choice artesunate + amodiaquine treatment uncomplicated p.
falciparum infections anhui province. addition to, artemether-lumefantrine 
can introduced alternative measure.
