plasmodium multigene families play central role pathogenesis malaria.
the plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes comprise largest multigene
family many plasmodium spp. however function(s) remains unknown. using
the rodent model malaria, plasmodium chabaudi, show individual cir
proteins differential localizations within infected red cell (irbc),
suggesting different functional roles blood-stage infection. cirs
appear located surface irbc merozoites therefore well
placed interact host molecules. line hypothesis, show for
the first time subset recombinant cirs bind mouse rbcs suggesting a
role cir rosette formation and/or invasion. together, results unravel 
differences subcellular localization ability bind mouse erythrocytes
between members cir family, strongly suggest different
functional roles blood-stage infection.
