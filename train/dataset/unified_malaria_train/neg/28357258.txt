horizontal gene transfer emerged crucial driving force evolution
of eukaryotes. also includes plasmodium falciparum related economically 
and clinically relevant apicomplexan parasites, whose rather small genomes have
been shaped natural selection different host populations also 
by horizontal gene transfer following endosymbiosis. however, rather
little reliable data horizontal gene transfer animal hosts bacteria
and apicomplexan parasites. show apicomplexan homologues of
peroxiredoxin 5 (prx5) prokaryotic ancestry therefore represent a
special subclass prx5 isoforms eukaryotes. using two different
immunobiochemical approaches, found p. falciparum prx5 homologue is
dually localized parasite plastid cytosol. dual localization is
reflected modular plasmodium-specific gene architecture consisting two
exons. despite plastid localization, phylogenetic analyses contradict 
acquisition secondary endosymbiosis support gene fusion event following 
a horizontal prokaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfer early apicomplexans. the
results provide unexpected insights evolution apicomplexan parasites 
as well molecular evolution peroxiredoxins, important family of
ubiquitous, usually highly concentrated thiol-dependent hydroperoxidases that
exert functions detoxifying enzymes, redox sensors chaperones.
