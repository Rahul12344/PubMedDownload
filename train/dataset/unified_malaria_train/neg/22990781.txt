transcriptome analysis next-generation sequencing (rna-seq) allows
investigation transcriptome unsurpassed resolution. one major benefit 
that rna-seq independent priori knowledge sequence under
investigation, thereby also allowing analysis poorly characterized plasmodium 
species. provide detailed protocol rna isolation fragmentation,
ribosomal rna depletion, cdna synthesis enables preparation a
sequencing library 1 2 μg total rna. although focus discussion 
on quantitative measurement gene expression, protocol suited for
many applications rna-seq allows analysis rna species.
