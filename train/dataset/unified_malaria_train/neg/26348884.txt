genetically attenuated parasites (gaps) lack genes essential liver
stage malaria parasite, therefore cause developmental arrest, have
been developed live vaccines rodent malaria models recently tested
in humans. genes targeted deletion often identified trial and
error. present systematic gene - protein transcript - expression
analyses several plasmodium species aim identify candidate genes
for generation novel gaps. lack liver stage expression data 
human malaria parasites, used data available liver stage development of
plasmodium yoelii, rodent malaria model, identify proteins expressed 
liver stage absent blood stage parasites. orthology-based search 
then employed identify orthologous proteins human malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum resulting total 310 genes expressed liver
stage lacking evidence protein expression blood stage parasites. among 
these 310 possible gap candidates, studied plasmodium liver stage
proteins phyletic distribution functional domain analyses shortlisted 
twenty gap-candidates; are: fabb/f, fabi, arp, 3 genes encoding subunits of
the pdh complex, dnaj, urm1, rs5, ancp, mcp, arh, gk, lisp2, vals, palm, four
conserved plasmodium proteins unknown function. parasites lacking one or
several genes might yield new attenuated malaria parasites for
experimental vaccination studies.
