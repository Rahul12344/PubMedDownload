we validated feasibility using plasmodium falciparum, human malaria
parasite, dna present wild caught vector mosquitoes characterization
of chloroquine resistance status. house frequenting mosquitoes belonging to
anopheles minimus complex collected human dwellings malaria
endemic area assam, northeast india dna extracted head-thorax
region individual mosquitoes. anopheles minimus complex mosquitoes were
identified species level screened presence plasmodium sp. using
molecular tools. nested pcr-rflp method used genotyping p. falciparum 
based k76t mutation chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene.
three 27 wild caught an. minimus mosquitoes harbouring p. falciparum 
sporozoites (positivity 11.1%) 3 76t mutation pfcrt gene,
indicating chloroquine resistance. approach characterizing antimalarial
resistance malaria parasite vector mosquitoes potentially used 
surveillance tool monitoring transmission antimalarial drug resistant
parasite strains community.
