background: role liver survival blood-stage malaria only
poorly understood. experimental blood-stage malaria plasmodium chabaudi, 
protective vaccination induces healing and, thus, survival otherwise lethal
infections. model appropriate study role liver in
vaccination-induced survival blood-stage malaria.
methods: female balb/c mice vaccinated non-infectious vaccine
consisting plasma membranes isolated form erythrocyte ghosts p.
chabaudi-infected erythrocytes week 3 week 1 infection p.
chabaudi blood-stage malaria. gene expression microarrays quantitative
real-time pcr used investigate response liver, terms of
expression mrna long intergenic non-coding (linc)rna, to
vaccination-induced healing infections lethal p. chabaudi malaria early
patency day 4 post infection, parasitized erythrocytes begin appear in
peripheral blood.
results: vaccination-induced healing infections, 23 genes identified to
be induced liver by > tenfold p < 0.01. one-third genes 
known involved erythropoiesis, kel, rhag, ahsp, ermap, slc4a1,
cldn13 gata1, gfi1b. another group > tenfold expressed genes include genes
involved natural cytotoxicity, encoding killer cell lectin-like 
receptors klrb1a, klrc3, klrd1, natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor 1
ncr1, well granzyme b encoding gzmb. additionally, series genes
involved control cell cycle mitosis identified: ccnb1, cdc25c,
ckap2l expressed > tenfold vaccination-protected mice, the
expression 22 genes least 100% higher vaccination-protected mice
than non-vaccinated mice. furthermore, distinct lincrna species changed
by > threefold livers vaccination-protected mice, whereas lethal malaria
induced different lincrnas.
conclusion: present data suggest protective vaccination accelerates 
malaria-induced occurrence extramedullary erythropoiesis, generation of
liver-resident cytotoxic cells, regeneration malaria-induced injury in
the liver early patency, may critical final survival otherwise
lethal blood-stage malaria p. chabaudi.
