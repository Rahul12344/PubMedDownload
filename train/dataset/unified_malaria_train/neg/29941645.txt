antimalarial drug resistance developed plasmodium falciparum become a
problem malaria control. evaluation drug resistance first step 
effective malaria control. study, investigated gene mutations of
p. falciparum using blood samples returned chinese migrant workers order 
to identify drug resistance-associated molecular markers. workers returned 
from africa southeast asia (sea) 2011 2016. polymorphisms pfcrt,
pfmdr1, k13-propeller genes haplotype patterns pfcrt pfmdr1
were analyzed. results showed presence four haplotypes pfcrt codons
72 76, including cvmnk (wild type), svmnt cviet (mutation types), cv
m/i n/e k/t (mixed type), 50.57%, 1.14%, 25.00%, 23.30% prevalence,
respectively. pfmdr1, n86y (22.28%) y184f (60.01%) main
prevalent mutations (mutations underlined). prevalence mutation at
position 550, 561, 575, 589 k13-propeller 1.09%, 0.54%, 0.54%, and
0.54%, respectively. data suggested pfcrt, pfmdr1, k13-propeller
polymorphisms potential markers assess drug resistance p. falciparum in
china, africa, sea.
