anopheles minimus important vector human malaria southern china and
southeast asia. phylogenetics mosquitoes well resolved, and
the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) proven important marker the
study evolutionary biology. study, complete mtgenome an.
minimus sequenced first time. 15 395 bp long encodes 37
genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (pcgs), 22 transfer rnas (trnas), two
ribosomal rnas (rrnas) non-coding region. gene organization is
consistent known anopheles mtgenomes. mtgenome performs clear
bias nucleotide composition positive at-skew negative gc-skew.
all 13 pcgs prefer use codon uua (leu), atn initiation codon but
cytochrome-oxidase subunit 1 (coi) nd5, tcg gtg, taa as
termination codon, coi, coii, coiii nd4, incomplete t. trnas
have typical clover-leaf structure, trna(ser(agn)) consistent with
known anopheles mtgenomes. control region includes conserved t-stretch 
a (ta)n stretch, highest a+t content 93.1%. phylogenetics of
an. minimus 18 anopheles species constructed maximum likelihood
and bayesian inference, based concatenated pcg sequences. subgenera,
cellia anopheles, nyssorhynchus kerteszia mutually close
relationships, respectively. punctulatus group leucosphyrus group of
neomyzomyia series, albitarsis group albitarsis series suggested 
to monophyletic. monophyletic status subgenera, cellia, anopheles, 
nyssorhynchus kerteszia need elucidated.
