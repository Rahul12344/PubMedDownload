this study examined ability p.falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ie) to
induce pro-adhesive environment host endothelium malaria
infection, prior systemic cytokine activation seen later phase of
disease. previous work shown increases receptor levels not
measured actual impact ie binding. using co-culture system range
of endothelial cells (ec) ie different cytoadherent properties, 
characterised specific expression adhesion receptors subsequent ie
binding facs adhesion assays. also examined specific
signalling pathways induced co-culture potentially involved in
the induction receptor expression. results confirmed icam-1 is
up-regulated, albeit much lower levels seen tnf activation, in
response co-culture infected erythrocytes three tissue endothelial
cell types tested up-regulation vcam-1 tissue-dependent. this
small increase levels ec receptors correlated large changes ie 
adhesion ability. co-culture either rbc ie increased potential of
subsequent adhesion indicating priming/modulation effects ec make them
more susceptible adhesion thereby recruitment ie. trypsin surface
digestion ie use pfsbp1-knockout (ko) parasite line abrogated the
up-regulation icam-1 reduced ie binding ec suggesting pfemp-1 
other molecules exported ie surface via pfsbp1 pathway major
mediators phenotype. also supported higher induction of
ec adhesion receptors adherent ie compared isogenic, non-adherent lines.
