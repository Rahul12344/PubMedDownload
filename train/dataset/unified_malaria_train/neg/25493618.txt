the characterization transcriptome proteome plasmodium falciparum
has tremendous resource understanding molecular physiology 
of parasite. however, translational dynamics link steady-state mrna
with protein levels well understood. study, bridge this
disconnect measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through
five stages p. falciparum blood phase developmental cycle. findings
show transcription translation tightly coupled, overt
translational control occurring less 10% transcriptome.
translationally regulated genes predominantly associated merozoite
egress functions. systematically define mrna 5' leader sequences, 3' utrs,
as well antisense transcripts, along ribosome occupancy each, and
establish accumulation ribosomes 5' leaders common transcript
feature. work represents highest resolution broadest portrait of
gene expression translation date medically important parasite.
