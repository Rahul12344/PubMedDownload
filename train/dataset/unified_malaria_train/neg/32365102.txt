plasmodium vivax p. falciparum, parasites responsible human
malaria worldwide, exhibit striking biological differences, important 
clinical consequences. unfortunately, p. vivax, unlike p. falciparum, cannot be
cultivated continuously vitro, limits understanding biology
and, consequently, ability effectively control vivax malaria. here, we
describe single-cell gene expression profiles 9,215 p. vivax parasites from
bloodstream infections aotus saimiri monkeys. results show that
transcription p. vivax genes occurs short periods the
intraerythrocytic cycle pattern gene expression conserved 
other plasmodium species. however, also identify strikingly high proportion 
of species-specific transcripts late schizonts, possibly associated the
specificity erythrocyte invasion. findings provide new robust markers 
of blood-stage parasites, including specific elusive p.
vivax male gametocytes, useful analyzing gene expression data
from laboratory field samples.
