dna vaccines infection plasmodium highly successful in
rodent models malaria shown promise limited number of
clinical trials conducted far. vaccine platform highly attractive for
numerous reasons, low cost favorable safety profile. gene gun 
delivery dna plasmids drastically reduces vaccine dose only
have potential make vaccines accessible affordable, also
simplifies (a) testing novel antigens vaccine candidates, (b) the
testing antigen combinations, (c) co-delivery antigens with
molecular adjuvants cytokines costimulatory molecules. described in
this chapter preparation inoculum (i.e., dna plasmids attached 
gold particles, coating inside plastic tubing also referred gene 
gun "bullets" cartridges), gene gun vaccination procedure, the
challenge mice plasmodium berghei parasites test efficacy the
experimental vaccine.
