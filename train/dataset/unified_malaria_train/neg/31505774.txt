the emergence spread drug resistance problem hindering malaria
elimination southeast asia. study, genetic variations drug
resistance markers plasmodium falciparum determined parasites from
asymptomatic populations located three geographically dispersed townships of
myanmar pcr sequencing. mutations dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr),
dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt),
multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 
1 (pfmrp1), kelch protein 13 (k13) present 92.3%, 97.6%, 84.0%,
98.8%, 68.3% parasites, respectively. pfcrt k76t, pfmdr1 n86y,
pfmdr1 i185k, pfmrp1 i876v mutations present 82.7%, 2.5%, 87.5%, 
59.8% isolates, respectively. prevalent haplotypes pfdhfr, pfdhps,
pfcrt pfmdr1 51i/59r/108n/164l, 436a/437g/540e/581a,
74i/75e/76t/220s/271e/326n/356t/371i, 86n/130e/184y/185k/1225v, respectively.
in addition, 57 isolates three different point mutations (k191t, f446i, and
p574l) three types n-terminal insertions (n, nn, nnn) k13 gene. 
total, 43 distinct haplotypes potentially associated multidrug resistance
were identified. findings demonstrate high prevalence of
multidrug-resistant p. falciparum asymptomatic infections diverse
townships myanmar, emphasizing importance targeting asymptomatic
infections prevent spread drug-resistant p. falciparum.
