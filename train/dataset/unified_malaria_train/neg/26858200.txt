background: insect haemocytes mediate cellular immune responses (e.g.,
phagocytosis) contribute synthesis humoral immune factors. in
previous work, genome-wide molecular characterization anopheles gambiae
circulating haemocytes followed functional gene characterization using
cell-based rnai screens. assays carried investigate role of
selected haemocyte-specific enriched genes phagocytosis bacterial
bio-particles, expression antimicrobial peptide cecropin1, basal and
induced expression mosquito complement factor lrim1 (leucine-rich repeat
immune gene i).
findings: studied impact subset genes (37 candidates) from
the haemocyte-specific dsrna collection development plasmodium the
mosquito vivo gene silencing. screening identifies 10 novel factors
with role mosquito response plasmodium. analysis vivo screening
phenotypes reveals significant anti-correlation prevalence of
oocysts melanised ookinetes.
conclusions: among novel immune genes putative pattern recognition proteins
(leucine-rich repeat, fibrinogen-domain r-type lectins), immune modulation
and signalling proteins (lps-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor, litaf
and clip proteases), components extracellular matrix laminin and
collagen. additional identified proteins storage protein hexamerin
and vesicular-type atpase (v-atpase) associated first time the
mosquito response plasmodium.
