the plant artemisia annua well known due production artemisinin, a
sesquiterpene lactone widely used malaria treatment. phytohormones
play important roles plant secondary metabolism, jasmonic acid (ja),
which induce artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua. nevertheless, the
ja-inducing mechanism remains poorly understood. expression gene aamyc2
was rapidly induced ja aamyc2 binds g-box-like motifs within the
promoters gene cyp71av1 dbr2, key structural genes the
artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. overexpression aamyc2 a. annua
significantly activated transcript levels cyp71av1 dbr2, which
resulted increased artemisinin content. contrast, artemisinin content
was reduced rnai transgenic a. annua plants expression of
aamyc2 suppressed. meanwhile, rnai transgenic a. annua plants showed
lower sensitivity methyl jasmonate treatment wild-type plants. 
results demonstrate aamyc2 positive regulator artemisinin
biosynthesis great value genetic engineering a. annua for
increased artemisinin production.
