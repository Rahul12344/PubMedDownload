central africa, forested region supports exceptionally high
biodiversity, hosts world's largest group hunter-gatherers, live in
close proximity groups adopted agriculture past 5000
years. understanding prehistory populations been
dramatically hampered almost total absence fossil remains this
region, limitation recently circumvented population genomics
approaches. different studies estimated ancestors rainforest
hunter-gatherers bantu-speaking farmers separated 60 000 years ago,
supporting occurrence ancient population structure africa since the
late pleistocene. conversely, holocene central africa characterized by
large-scale population migrations associated emergence agriculture,
and increased genetic interactions autochthonous rainforest
hunter-gatherers expanding bantu-speaking farmers. genomic scans have
detected numerous candidate loci positive selection populations,
including convergent adaptation short stature groups rainforest
hunter-gatherers local adaptation endemic malaria western central
africans. furthermore, recent increasing evidence adaptive
variation acquired various african populations admixture,
suggesting previously unappreciated role intraspecies gene flow local
adaptation. ancient modern dna studies greatly broaden, probably
challenge, view past history central africa, introgression
from yet uncharacterized archaic hominins long-term adaptation distinct
ecological niches suspected.
