there increasing interest mapping genes pathogens underlie 
important phenotypic traits virulence drug resistance. plasmodium
falciparum genome exhibits sequence variation contributes pathogenic 
mechanisms parasite. determining prevalence resistance markers
could provide prediction drug efficacy. copy number polymorphism (cnp) of
genes shown influence important parasite phenotypes. work,
cnps within genes involved drug resistance phenotypic traits namely 
p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr-1), gtp cyclo hydrolase (gch1), ring 
infected erythrocyte surface antigen precursor (resa) hypothetical protein 
coding gene analyzed quantitative real time-polymerase reaction (qrt-pcr)
among clinical isolates collected uganda. pfmdr-1 codons 86 1246 and
p. falciparum chloroquine resistance (pfcrt) codon 76 genotyped single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (pcr-rflp), proportion resistance associated
mutations determined among mild severe malaria cases using the
chi-square test. forty 42 p. falciparum isolates collected children with
mild severe malaria respectively analyzed cnps. seventy five 81 
p. falciparum isolates children mild severe malaria analyzed
for snps. pfmdr-1, gch1 novel gene amplifications identified among the
p. falciparum clinical isolates. although chloroquine officially withdrawn
from policy use since 7 years, p. falciparum isolates presented the
associated pfcrt k76t mutation, whatever clinical status specific
mutation pfmdr-1 gene associated disease type. conclusion,
this study provides baseline measures continued surveillance changes in
copy number snp types among genes implicated drug resistance other
important phenotypes may potential role parasite virulence
mechanisms drug treatment outcomes.
