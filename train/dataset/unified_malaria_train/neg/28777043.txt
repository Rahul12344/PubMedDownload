malaria, caused plasmodium falciparum become major health burden most
tropical developing countries. p. falciparum histidine rich protein2
(pfhrp2), exhibits polymorphism, widely used diagnostic
marker. recently, reported development monoclonal antibodies against
conserved c-terminal 105 amino acids pfhrp2 malaria diagnosis. now, in
this study, diagnostic performance two anti-c-terminal pfhrp2 mabs (b10c1 
and aa3c10) evaluated 100 blood samples clinically identified
malaria patients seven different geographical centers india. sandwich
elisa, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) statistical tools used the
evaluation performance anti-c-terminal pfhrp2 mab. mabs
detected p. falciparum (mean od value 1.525 ± 0.56) malaria great accuracy
with cross reactivity p. plasmodium vivax (mean od value 0.285 ± 0.051)
and normal healthy control samples (mean od value 0.185 ± 0.06) sandwich elisa
assay. samples rdt negative p. falciparum also reactive
in sandwich elisa mean od value (1.303 ± 0.532). amount pfhrp2
antigen patients' blood sample quantified categorized three
distinct groups hrp2 antigen high, intermediate low amounts.
the presence pfhrp2 gene also confirmed pcr analysis. sensitivity
and specificity mab found 95 96% respectively. data
strongly suggest anti-c-terminal pfhrp2 mabs b10c1 aa3c10 have
merits improvising existing malarial diagnostics.
