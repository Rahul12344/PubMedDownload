background: plasmodium falciparum causes severe form malaria and
affects 3.2 million people annually. due increasing incidence of
resistance existing drugs, growing need discover new more
effective drugs malaria. despite global importance p. falciparum, 
vast majority proteins uncharacterized experimentally. application 
newer approaches using several "omics" data become successful exploring
the biological interactions underlying cellular processes. till date many
system level study published using p. falciparum protein protein
interaction. hence, purpose study develop standardized
pipeline structural, functional, topographical analysis large scale
protein protein interaction network (ppin) order identify proteins
important network topology integrity. here, p. falciparum ppin been
utilized model better understanding molecular mechanisms of
survival pathogenesis malaria parasite.
methods: various graph theoretical approaches implemented identify highly
interacting hub central proteins crucial network integrity.
further, potential network perturbing proteins via in-silico knock-out (ko)
analysis isolate important interacting proteins (iips), principle,
can elicit significant impact global local environments p.
falciparum interaction network.
results: 177 hubs 132 central proteins identified malarial
(proteins: 1607; interactions: 4750) ppi networks. using in-silico knock-out 
exercise 131 99 global local network perturbing proteins also
identified. finally, 271 proteins p. falciparum shortlisted as
important interacting proteins (iips), play crucial role in
intra-pathogen network integrity, stage specificity also interact with
various human proteins involved multiple metabolic pathways within host
cell. iips could used potential drug targets malarial research.
conclusion: graph theoretical analysis ppin useful approach to
identify proteins important regulation interactions required 
for organism's survival. important interacting proteins (iips) identified
using p. falciparum ppin provides useful dataset containing probable candidates
for future drug target analysis.
