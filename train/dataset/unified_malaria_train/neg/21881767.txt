malaria important public health problem several countries. in
thailand, co-infections plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum common.
we examined prevalence patterns mutations p. vivax dihydrofolate
reductase (pvdhfr) p. vivax dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps) 103 blood
samples collected patients p. vivax infection attended the
malaria clinic mae sot, tak province 2009 2010. using nested
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorfism, examined
single nucleotide polymorphisms-haplotypes amino acid positions 13, 33, 57,
58, 61, 117 173 pvdhfr 383 553 pvdhps. parasite isolates
carried mutant pvdhfr alleles, common alleles triple
mutants (99%). eight different types pvdhfr combination alleles were
found, follows: 57i/58r/117t, 57i/58r/117t, 57i/58r/117t/n, 57l/58r/117t,
57l/58r/117t, 58r/61m/117n, 58r/61m/117n 13l/57l/58r/117t. common
pvdhfr alleles 57i/58r/117t (77.7%), 57i/58r/117t/n (1%), 57l/58r/117t
(5.8%) 58r/61m/117n (14.5%). common pvdhfr alleles 57i/58r/117t
(77.7%), 57i/58r/117t/n (1%), 57l/58r/117t (5.8%) 58r/61m/117n (14.5%).
additionally, recovered one isolate carrying quadruple mutant allele,
13l/57l/58r/117t. prevalent pvdhps allele single mutation amino
acid 383 (82.5%), followed wild-type a383/a553 (17.5%) allele. results
suggest p. vivax isolates thailand carry combination of
mutations pvdhfr pvdhps. findings demonstrate development new 
antifolate drugs effective sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant p. vivax
is required.
