in insects, steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20e) coordinates major
developmental transitions. first final steps 20e
biosynthesis characterized, pathway 7-dehydrocholesterol to
5β-ketodiol, commonly referred "black box", remains hypothetical and
whether still unidentified enzymes unknown. black box would
include oxidative steps, believed mediated p450 enzymes. 
to identify new enzyme(s) involved steroid synthesis, analyzed by
small-scale microarray expression genes encoding p450 enzymes of
the malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae active steroidogenic organs adults, 
ovaries blood-fed females male reproductive tracts, compared inactive
steroidogenic organs, ovaries non-blood-fed females. genes encoding
p450 enzymes specifically overexpressed female ovaries blood-meal
or male reproductive tracts three genes found be
overexpressed active steroidogenic organs females males: cyp307a1,
cyp4g16 cyp6n1. among genes, cyp307a1 expression pattern
similar mosquito steroidogenic genes. moreover, loss-of-function by
transient rnai targeting cyp307a1 disrupted ecdysteroid production demonstrating 
that gene required ecdysteroid biosynthesis anopheles gambiae.
