background: anaemia major public health concern especially african
children living malaria-endemic regions. interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) elevated 
during malaria infection thought influence erythropoiesis iron
status. genetic variants ifn-γ gene (ifng) associated increased
ifn-γ production. investigated putative functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) haplotypes ifng relation nutritional iron
status anaemia gambian children malaria season. methods: used
previously available data gambian family trios determine informative snps
and used agena bioscience massarray platform type five snps 
ifng gene cohort 780 gambian children aged 2-6 years. also measured
haemoglobin biomarkers iron status inflammation start end
of malaria season. results: identified five ifng haplotype-tagging snps (
ifng-1616 [rs2069705], ifng+874 [rs2430561], ifng+2200 [rs1861493], ifng+3234
[rs2069718] ifng+5612 [rs2069728]). ifng+2200c [rs1861493] allele was
associated reduced haemoglobin concentrations (adjusted β -0.44 [95% ci
-0.75, -0.12]; bonferroni adjusted p = 0.03) trend towards iron deficiency 
compared wild-type end malaria season multivariable models
adjusted potential confounders. haplotype uniquely identified ifng+2200c
was similarly associated reduced haemoglobin levels trends towards iron 
deficiency, anaemia iron deficiency anaemia end malaria season 
in models adjusted age, sex, village, inflammation malaria parasitaemia. 
conclusion: found limited statistical evidence linking ifng polymorphisms with
a risk developing iron deficiency anaemia gambian children. more
definitive studies needed investigate effects genetically
influenced ifn-γ levels risk iron deficiency anaemia children
living malaria-endemic areas.
