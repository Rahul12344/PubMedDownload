the liver stage plasmodium parasite remains one promising
targets intervention malaria clinically silent, precedes the
symptomatic blood stage represents bottleneck parasite life cycle.
however, many aspects development parasite stage are
far understood. liver stage, parasite undergoes extensive
replication, forming tens thousands infectious merozoites each
invading sporozoite. implies efficient accurate process of
cytokinesis thus also organelle development segregation. have
generated first time plasmodium berghei double-fluorescent parasite
lines, allowing visualization apicoplast, mitochondria nuclei live 
liver stage parasites. using seen parallel nuclear
division, apicoplast mitochondrion become two extensively branched and
intertwining structures. organelles undergo impressive morphological and
positional changes prior cell division. form merozoites, parasite
undergoes cytokinesis complex process organelle development and
segregation forming daughter merozoites could analysed detail
using newly generated transgenic parasites.
