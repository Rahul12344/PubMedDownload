the global spread plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter
(pfcrt) variant haplotypes earlier caused widespread loss chloroquine (cq)
efficacy. asia, novel pfcrt mutations emerged dd2 allelic
background recently implicated high-level resistance piperaquine,
and n326s i356t associated genetic backgrounds which
resistance emerged artemisinin derivatives. analyzing large-scale genome
sequencing data, report predominant asian cq-resistant dd2 haplotype 
is undetectable africa. instead, gb4 previously unexplored cam783
haplotypes predominate, along wild-type, drug-sensitive pfcrt has
reemerged major haplotype. interrogate alleles impact drug
susceptibility, generated pfcrt-modified isogenic parasite lines spanning 
mutational interval gb4 dd2, includes cam783 involves amino
acid substitutions residues 326 356. relative dd2, gb4 cam783
alleles observed mediate lower degrees resistance cq the
first-line drug amodiaquine, resulting higher growth rates. these
findings suggest differences growth rates, surrogate parasite
fitness, influence selection context african infections are
frequently characterized high transmission rates, mixed infections, increased 
immunity, less recourse treatment. also observe asian dd2
allele affords partial protection piperaquine yet directly
impact artemisinin efficacy. results help inform regional
recommendations antimalarials, whose activity influenced and, certain
cases, enhanced select pfcrt variant haplotypes.importance study
defines allelic distribution pfcrt, important mediator multidrug
resistance plasmodium falciparum, africa asia. leveraged
whole-genome sequence analysis gene editing demonstrate current drug
combinations select different allelic variants gene shape
region-specific parasite population structures. document ability pfcrt 
mutations modulate parasite susceptibility current antimalarials in
dissimilar, pfcrt allele-specific ways. study underscores importance 
actively monitoring pfcrt genotypes identify emerging patterns multidrug
resistance help guide region-specific treatment options.
