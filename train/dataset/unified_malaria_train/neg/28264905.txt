human cerebral malaria (hcm) serious complication plasmodium falciparum
infection. severe outcomes patients include coma, permanent
neurological deficits, death. recently, large-scale magnetic resonance
imaging (mri) study humans identified brain swelling prominent
predictor fatal hcm. therefore, study, sought define the
mechanism controlling brain edema use murine experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm) model. specifically, investigated ability cd8 
cells initiate brain edema ecm. determined areas blood-brain
barrier (bbb) permeability colocalized reduction cerebral
endothelial cell tight-junction proteins claudin-5 occludin. furthermore,
through small-animal mri, analyzed edema vascular leakage. using
gadolinium-enhanced t1-weighted mri, determined vascular permeability 
not homogeneous rather confined specific regions brain. our
findings show bbb permeability localized within brainstem, olfactory
bulb, lateral ventricle. concurrently initiation vascular
permeability, t2-weighted mri revealed edema brain swelling. importantly,
ablation cytolytic effector molecule perforin fully protected against
vascular permeability edema. furthermore, perforin production specifically by
cd8 cells required cause fatal edema ecm. propose cd8 t
cells initiate bbb breakdown perforin-mediated disruption tight
junctions. turn, leakage vasculature parenchyma causes brain
swelling edema. results breakdown homeostatic maintenance that
likely contributes ecm pathology.
