background: complex diseases involve many genes, genes often
associated several different illnesses. disease similarity measurement can
be based shared genotype phenotype. quantifying relationships genes
can reveal previously unknown connections form reference base therapy
development drug repurposing.
methods: introduce method measure disease similarity that
incorporates uniqueness shared genes. disease pair, calculated
the uniqueness score constructed disease similarity matrices using omim and
disease ontology annotation.
results: using disease ontology-based matrix, identified several
interesting connections cancer disease conditions as
malaria, along studies support findings. also found several high
scoring pairwise relationships little literature
support, highlighting potentially interesting connections warranting additional
study.
conclusions: developed co-occurrence matrix based gene uniqueness to
examine relationships diseases omim dorif data. our
similarity matrix used identify potential disease relationships 
motivate studies investigating causal mechanisms diseases.
