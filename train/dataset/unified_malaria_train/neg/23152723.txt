background: primaquine key drug malaria elimination. addition to
being drug active dormant relapsing forms plasmodium
vivax, primaquine sole effective treatment infectious p. falciparum
gametocytes, may interrupt transmission help contain spread of
artemisinin resistance. however, primaquine trigger haemolysis patients
with deficiency glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdd). poor information 
is available distribution individuals risk primaquine-induced 
haemolysis. present continuous evidence-based prevalence map g6pdd and
estimates affected populations, together national index relative
haemolytic risk.
methods findings: representative community surveys phenotypic g6pdd
prevalence identified 1,734 spatially unique sites. surveys formed
the evidence-base bayesian geostatistical model adapted gene's
x-linked inheritance, predicted g6pdd allele frequency map across malaria
endemic countries (mecs) generated population-weighted estimates affected 
populations. highest median prevalence (peaking 32.5%) predicted across
sub-saharan africa arabian peninsula. although g6pdd prevalence was
generally lower across central southeast asia, rarely exceeding 20%, the
majority g6pdd individuals (67.5% median estimate) asian countries. 
we estimated g6pdd allele frequency 8.0% (interquartile range: 7.4-8.8)
across mecs, 5.3% (4.4-6.7) within malaria-eliminating countries. the
reliability map contingent underlying data informing model; 
population heterogeneity represented available surveys, and
important weaknesses exist map across data-sparse regions. uncertainty
metrics used quantify aspects limitations map.
finally, assembled database g6pdd variant occurrences inform a
national-level index relative g6pdd haemolytic risk. asian countries, where
variants severe, highest relative risks g6pdd.
conclusions: g6pdd widespread spatially heterogeneous across mecs
where primaquine would valuable malaria control elimination. maps 
and population estimates presented reflect potential risk of
primaquine-associated harm. absence non-toxic alternatives to
primaquine, results represent additional evidence help inform safe use
of valuable, yet dangerous, component malaria-elimination toolkit.
