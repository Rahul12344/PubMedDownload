half century discovery adamts13. adamts13 primarily synthesized
in liver, main function cleave von willebrand factor (vwf)
anchored endothelial surface, circulation, sites vascular
injury. deficiency plasma adamts13 activity (<10%) resulting mutations of
the adamts13 gene autoantibodies adamts13 causes hereditary or
acquired (idiopathic) ttp. adamts13 activity usually normal modestly
reduced (>20%) forms thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to
hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, infection, disseminated
malignancy hemolytic uremic syndrome. plasma infusion exchange remains
the initial treatment choice date, novel therapeutics as
recombinant adamts13 gene therapy development. moreover, adamts13
