plasmodium falciparum malaria important parasitic disease worldwide, 
responsible estimated 1 million deaths annually. two p. falciparum genes
code putative phosphoglycerate mutases (pgmases), widespread protein group 
characterized involvement histidine residues catalytic
mechanism. pgmases responsible interconversion 2 and
3-phosphoglycerate, intermediate step glycolysis pathway. have
determined crystal structures one p. falciparum's pgmases (pfpgm2) 
and functionally distinct phosphoglycerate mutase cryptosporidium parvum, 
a related apicomplexan parasite. performed sequence structural comparisons
between two structures, another p. falciparum enzyme (pfpgm1) several
other pgm family members organisms. comparisons revealed a
distinct conformation catalytically active residues seen previously
determined phosphoglycerate mutase structures. furthermore, characterization of
their enzymatic activities revealed contrasting behaviors pfpgm2 
the classical cofactor-dependent pgmase c. parvum, clearly establishing
pfpgm2 phosphatase residual level mutase activity. support
for function attribution provided structural comparison with
previously characterized pgm family members. genetic characterization pgm2 
the rodent parasite plasmodium berghei indicated protein might be
essential blood stage asexual growth, gfp tagged allele expressed 
both blood zygote ookinete development located cytoplasm. p.
falciparum pgm2 either enzyme implicated phosphate metabolism the
parasite regulator life cycle.
