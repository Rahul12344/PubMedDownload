progress, partially effective. development next generation 
highly effective vaccines requires elucidation protective immune response.

global gene expression profiling ideal understanding response to
vaccination protection disease. availability experimental
sporozoite challenge humans test candidate malaria vaccines offers a
precious opportunity unavailable current targets vaccine research

profiling studies context malaria vaccine research published 
to date. review outlines background, existing studies, limits and
opportunities gene expression studies accelerate malaria vaccine research.
