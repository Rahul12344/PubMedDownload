senegal since 2003 used sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) intermittent
preventive treatment (ipt) malaria risk groups. however, large-scale
ipt strategy may result increasing drug resistance. study investigated the
possible impact sp-ipt given infants children prevalence of
sp-resistant haplotypes plasmodium falciparum genes pfdhfr pfdhps,
comparing sites without ipti/c. p. falciparum positives samples (n=352) 
were collected children 5years age two cross-sectional
surveys 2010 2011 three health districts (two ipti/c one without
ipti/c intervention) located southern part senegal. prevalence of
sp-resistance-related haplotypes pfdhfr pfdhps determined nested
pcr followed sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (ssop)-elisa. the
prevalence pfdhfr double mutant haplotypes (cnrn cicn) stable
between years at<10% control group (p=0.69), rose significantly
in ipti/c group 2% 2010 20% 2011 (p=0.008). prevalence of
the pfdhfr triple mutant haplotype (cirn) increased groups, only
significantly ipti/c group 41% 65% 2011 (p=0.005). conversely, 
the pfdhps 437g mutation decreased groups 44.6% 28.6% (p=0.07)
and 66.7% 47.5% (p=0.02) 2010 2011 control the
ipti/c groups, respectively. combined pfdhfr, weak trend for
decreasing prevalence quadruple mutants (triple pfdhfr+pfdhps 437g) both
groups (p=0.15 p=0.34). two cross-sectional surveys, some
significant changes observed sp-resistance-related genes. however,
since changes observed two groups, ipti/c strategy does
only seem limited impact resistance development factors as
well. however, continuous monitoring needed, due up-scaling the
ipti/c strategy senegal according recommendations.
