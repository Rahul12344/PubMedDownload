we explored constructed haplotype network simian malaria species:
plasmodium knowlesi, p. cynomolgi p. inui aiming understand the
transmission dynamics mosquitoes, humans macaques. mosquitoes were
collected villages area zoonotic malaria prevalent. pcr
analysis confirmed anopheles balabacensis main vector macaque
parasites, moreover nearly 60% mosquitoes harboured one
plasmodium species. fragments a-type small subunit ribosomal rna (ss rrna)
amplified salivary gland sporozoites, equivalent sequences obtained from
genbank used construct haplotype networks. patterns consistent
with presence geographically distinct populations p. inui p.
cynomolgi, three discrete p. knowlesi populations. study provides a
preliminary snapshot structure populations, insufficient
to answer aim. thus, collection parasites various hosts and
over time, associated systematic analysis set genetical loci is
strongly advocated order obtain clear picture parasite population 
and flow different hosts. important devise measures that
will minimise risk transmission humans, zoonotic malaria
impedes malaria elimination.
