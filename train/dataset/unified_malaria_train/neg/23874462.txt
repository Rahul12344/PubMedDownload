the disadvantages needle-based immunisation motivate development of
simple, low cost, needle-free alternatives. vaccine delivery cutaneous
environments rich specialised antigen-presenting cells using microprojection
patches practical immunological advantages conventional needle
delivery. additionally, stable coating vaccine onto microprojections removes
logistical obstacles presented strict requirement cold-chain storage
and distribution liquid vaccine, lyophilised vaccine plus diluent. these
attributes make technologies particularly suitable delivery vaccines
against diseases malaria, exerts worst effects countries
with poorly-resourced healthcare systems. live viral vectors including
adenoviruses poxviruses encoding exogenous antigens shown significant
clinical promise vaccines, due ability generate high numbers of
antigen-specific cells. here, simian adenovirus serotype 63 the
