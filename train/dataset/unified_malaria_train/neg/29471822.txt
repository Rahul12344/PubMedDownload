background: plasmodium falciparum malaria remains major health burden and
genomic research represents one necessary approaches continued
progress towards malaria control elimination. sample acquisition this
purpose troublesome, majority malaria-infected individuals living 
in rural areas, away main infrastructure electrical grid. aim of
this study describe low-tech procedure sample p. falciparum specimens
for direct whole genome sequencing (wgs), without use electricity and
cold-chain.
methods: venous blood samples collected malaria patients bandim,
guinea-bissau leukocyte-depleted using plasmodipur filters, enriched
parasite sample spotted whatman paper dried. samples stored
at ambient temperatures subsequently used dna-extraction. ratios of
parasite:human content extracted dna assessed qpcr, five
samples varying parasitaemia, sequenced. sequencing data used to
analyse sample content, well sample coverage depth compared to
the 3d7 reference genome.
results: qpcr revealed 73% 199 samples applicable wgs, as
defined minimum ratio parasite:human dna 2:1. wgs revealed even
distribution sequence data across 3d7 reference genome, regardless of
parasitaemia. acquired read depths varied 16 99×, coverage varied
from 87.5 98.9% 3d7 reference genome. snp-analysis six genes, for
which amplicon sequencing performed previously, confirmed the
reliability wgs-data.
conclusion: study describes simple filter paper based protocol for
sampling p. falciparum malaria patients subsequent direct wgs, enabling 
acquisition samples remote settings access electricity.
