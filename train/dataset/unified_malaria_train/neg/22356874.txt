background: majority haemosporida species infect birds reptiles, but
many important genera, including plasmodium, infect mammals. dipteran vectors
shared avian, reptilian mammalian haemosporida, suggest multiple invasions
of mammalia haemosporidian evolution; yet, phylogenetic analyses have
detected single invasion event. now, several important
mammal-infecting genera absent analyses. study focuses on
the evolutionary origin polychromophilus, unique malaria genus only
infects bats (microchiroptera) transmitted bat flies (nycteribiidae).
methods: two species polychromophilus obtained wild bats caught in
switzerland. molecularly characterized using four genes (asl, clpc,
coi, cytb) three different genomes (nucleus, apicoplast, mitochondrion).
these data combined data 60 taxa haemosporida available in
genbank. bayesian inference, maximum likelihood range rooting methods
were used test specific hypotheses concerning phylogenetic relationships
between polychromophilus haemosporidian genera.
results: polychromophilus melanipherus polychromophilus murinus samples
show genetically distinct patterns group according species. bayesian
tree topology suggests monophyletic clade polychromophilus falls
within avian/saurian clade plasmodium directed hypothesis testing
confirms plasmodium origin.
conclusion: polychromophilus' ancestor likely bird- or
reptile-infecting plasmodium switched bats. invasion mammals 
as hosts has, therefore, unique event evolutionary history of
haemosporida, despite suspected costs adapting new host. was,
moreover, accompanied switch dipteran host.
