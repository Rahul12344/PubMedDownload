the heme peroxidase hpx15 evolutionary conserved anopheline
lineage-specific gene. previously, found gene present the
genome 19 worldwide distributed different species anopheles mosquito and
its orthologs absent mosquitoes, insects, human. addition,
65-99% amino acid identity among 19 orthologs permitted us hypothesize
that functional aspects gene might also conserved different
anophelines. study, found anopheles stephensi ashpx15 gene is
mainly expressed midgut highly induced uninfected plasmodium 
berghei-infected blood feeding. rna interference-mediated silencing midgut
ashpx15 gene drastically reduced number developing p. berghei oocysts. 
antiplasmodial gene nitric oxide synthase induced 13-fold silenced midguts
when compared unsilenced controls. interestingly, induction of
antiplasmodial immunity ashpx15-silenced midguts absolute agreement with
anopheles gambiae. a. gambiae, aghpx15 catalyzes formation dityrosine
network luminal side midgut suppresses activation mosquito 
immunity bolus bacteria. thus, low-immunity zone created this
mechanism indirectly supports plasmodium development inside midgut lumen.
these indistinguishable functional behaviors conserved homology indicates
that hpx15 might potent target manipulate antiplasmodial immunity 
the anopheline midgut, open new frontiers field malaria
control.
