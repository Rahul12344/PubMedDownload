charged, solvent-exposed residues entrance substrate binding site
(gatekeeper residues) produce electrostatic dipole interactions approaching 
substrates, control access novel mechanism called "electrostatic
gatekeeper effect". proof-of-concept study demonstrates nucleotide 
specificity engineered altering electrostatic properties the
gatekeeper residues outside binding site. using blastocystis succinyl-coa
synthetase (scs, ec 6.2.1.5), demonstrated gatekeeper mutant (ed)
resulted atp-specific scs show high gtp specificity. moreover, nucleotide
binding site mutant (lf) effect gtp specificity remained
atp-specific. however, via combination gatekeeper mutant the
nucleotide binding site mutant (ed+lf), complete reversal nucleotide
specificity obtained gtp, detectable activity obtained with
atp. striking result combined mutant (ed+lf) due two changes; 
negatively charged gatekeeper residues (ed) favored gtp access, nucleotide
binding site residues (lf) altered atp binding, consistent the
hypothesis "electrostatic gatekeeper effect". results further
supported molecular modeling simulation studies. hence, imperative
to extend strategy gatekeeper effect different range crucial
enzymes (synthetases, kinases, transferases) engineer substrate
specificity various industrial applications substrate-based drug design.
