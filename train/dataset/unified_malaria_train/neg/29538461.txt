due remarkable parasitocidal activity, artemisinins represent key
components first-line therapies plasmodium falciparum malaria.
however, decline efficacy artemisinin-based drugs jeopardizes global
efforts control ultimately eradicate disease. better understand the
resistance phenotype, artemisinin-resistant parasite lines derived two 
clones 3d7 strain p. falciparum using selection regimen mimics
how parasites interact drug within patients. long term vitro
selection induced profound stage-specific resistance artemisinin its
relative compounds. chemosensitivity transcriptional profiling of
artemisinin-resistant parasites indicate enhanced adaptive responses against
oxidative stress protein damage associated decreased artemisinin
susceptibility. corroborates previous findings implicating these
cellular functions artemisinin resistance natural infections. genomic
characterization two derived parasite lines revealed spectrum of
sequence copy number polymorphisms could play role regulating
artemisinin response, include mutations pfk13, main marker 
artemisinin resistance southeast asia. taken together, present a
functional vitro model artemisinin resistance underlined new
set genetic polymorphisms potential genetic markers.
