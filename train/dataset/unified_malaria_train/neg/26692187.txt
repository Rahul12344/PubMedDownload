background: upstream open reading frames (uorfs) upstream augs (uaugs) can
regulate translation downstream orfs. rich genome plasmodium
falciparum, due higher content start stop codons, the
potential give rise large number uorfs uaugs may affect
expression flanking orfs.
methods: bioinformatics approach used detect uatgs associated with
different genes parasite. study effect uaugs on
the expression downstream orf, promoters 5' leaders containing uaugs
and uorfs cloned upstream luciferase reporter gene. luciferase assays
were carried transient transfection experiments assess effects of
uaugs mutations reporter expression.
results: average number uatgs uorfs seen p. falciparum coding
sequences (cds) expectedly high compared less biased genomes. certain
genes, including var gene family contain maximum number uatgs and
uorfs parasite. possess ~5 times uorfs ~4.5 times uaugs
within 100 bases upstream start codons cds parasite. a
60 bp upstream region containing three orfs five atgs var gene
pf3d7_0400100 gene unknown function (pf3d7_0517100) cloned upstream
of luciferase start codon, driven hsp86 promoter, resulted loss 
luciferase activity. restored atgs present -60 bp
were mutated ttgs. point mutations atgs showed even one aug was
sufficient repress luciferase gene.
conclusions: overall, work indicates p. falciparum genome a
large number uatgs uorfs repress expression flanking orfs.
the role augs translation initiation suggests repression is
mediated preventing translation initiation complex reaching main 
aug downstream orf. p. falciparum ribosome able bypass these
uaugs uorfs highly expressed genes remains question future
research.
