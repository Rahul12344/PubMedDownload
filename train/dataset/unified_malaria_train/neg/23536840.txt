background: merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) candidate target the
development blood stage vaccines malaria. polymorphism msp-1 be
useful genetic marker strain differentiation malarial parasites.
although sequence diversity msp-1 locus extensively analyzed in
field isolates plasmodium falciparum p. vivax, extent variation 
its homologues p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri, remains unknown.
methodology/principal findings: analysis mitochondrial cytochrome b
sequences 10 p. ovale isolates symptomatic malaria patients diverse 
endemic areas thailand revealed co-existence p. ovale curtisi (n = 5) and
p. ovale wallikeri (n = 5). direct sequencing pcr-amplified products
encompassing entire coding region msp-1 p. ovale curtisi (pocmsp-1) and
p. ovale wallikeri (powmsp-1) identified 3 imperfect repeated segments the
former one latter. amino acid differences proteins 
were located interspecies variable domains malarial msp-1. synonymous
nucleotide diversity (πs) exceeded nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (πn) for
both pocmsp-1 powmsp-1, albeit non-significant level. however, when
msp-1 species considered together, πs significantly greater
than πn (p<0.0001), suggesting purifying selection shaped diversity at
this locus prior speciation. phylogenetic analysis based conserved domains 
has placed pocmsp-1 powmsp-1 distinct bifurcating branch probably
diverged around 4.5 million years ago.
conclusion/significance: msp-1 sequences support p. ovale curtisi p.
ovale wallikeri distinct species. species sympatric thailand. the
low level sequence diversity pocmsp-1 powmsp-1 among thai isolates
could stem persistent low prevalence species, limiting chance
of outcrossing locus.
