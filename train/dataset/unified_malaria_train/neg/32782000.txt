background: gene drives based crispr-cas9 technology increasingly being
considered tools reducing capacity mosquito populations transmit
malaria, one promising options driving endonuclease genes that
reduce fertility female mosquitoes. particular, much interest 
in constructs target conserved mosquito doublesex (dsx) gene that
the emergence functional drive-resistant alleles unlikely. proof of
principle constructs lead substantial population suppression
has obtained population cages, evaluated use in
sub-saharan africa. here, use simulation modelling understand factors
affecting spread type gene drive one million-square
kilometre area west africa containing substantial environmental social
heterogeneity.
results: found driving endonuclease gene targeting female fertility
could lead substantial reductions malaria vector populations regional 
scale. exact level suppression influenced additional fitness costs
of transgene somatic expression cas9, deposition in
sperm eggs leading damage zygote. absence costs, 
of emergent drive-resistant alleles restore female fertility, population
suppression across study area predicted stabilise ~ 95% 4 years
after releases commence. small additional fitness costs greatly affect
levels suppression, though fertility females whose offspring
transmit construct drops ~ 40%, population suppression is
much less efficient. show suppression potential drive allele with
high fitness costs enhanced engineering also express male bias in
the progeny transgenic males. irrespective strength drive
allele, spatial model predicts somewhat less suppression equivalent
non-spatial models, particular highly seasonal regions dry season
stochasticity reduces drive efficiency. explored robustness these
results uncertainties mosquito ecology, particular method of
surviving dry season dispersal rates.
conclusions: modelling presented indicates considerable suppression
of vector populations achieved within years using female
sterility gene drive, though impact likely heterogeneous space
and time.
