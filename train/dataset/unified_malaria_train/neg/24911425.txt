the extent environmental factors influence ability anopheles
mosquitoes transmit malaria parasites remains poorly explored. environmental
variation, change ambient temperature, necessarily influence 
the rates host parasite processes equivalently, potentially resulting in
complex effects infection outcomes. proof principle, used anopheles
stephensi rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium yoelii, examine the
effects range constant temperatures one aspect host defense
(detected alterations expression nitric oxide synthase gene - nos) to
parasite infection. experimentally boosted mosquito midgut immunity to
infection dietary supplementation essential amino acid
l-arginine (l-arg), increases midgut nitric oxide (no) levels by
infection-induced nos catalysis a. stephensi. intermediate temperatures,
supplementation reduced oocyst prevalence, oocyst intensity, sporozoite
prevalence suggesting outcome parasite infection potentially
dependent upon rate nos-mediated midgut immunity. low high
temperature extremes, however, infection severely constrained irrespective of
supplementation. effects l-arg appeared mediated no-dependent
negative feedback nos expression, evidenced depressed nos expression 
l-arg treated groups temperatures supplementation decreased parasite
infection. results suggest need consider direct (e.g. effects of
mosquito body temperature parasite physiology) indirect effects (e.g.
mediated changes mosquito physiology/immunity) environmental
factors mosquito-malaria interactions order understand natural variation
in vector competence.
