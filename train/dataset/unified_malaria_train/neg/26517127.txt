scale long lasting insecticide nets (llins) massively contributed to
reduce malaria mortality across africa. however, resistance pyrethroid
insecticides malaria vectors threatens continued effectiveness.
deciphering detailed molecular basis resistance designing
diagnostic tools critical implement suitable resistance management
strategies. here, demonstrated allelic variation two cytochrome p450
genes important driver pyrethroid resistance major african 
malaria vector anopheles funestus detected key mutations controlling this
resistance. africa-wide polymorphism analysis duplicated genes cyp6p9a 
and cyp6p9b revealed genes directionally selected alleles
segregating according resistance phenotypes. modelling docking simulations
predicted resistant alleles better metabolizers pyrethroids than
susceptible alleles. metabolism assays performed recombinant enzymes of
various alleles confirmed alleles resistant mosquitoes had
significantly higher activities toward pyrethroids. additionally, transgenic
expression drosophila showed flies expressing resistant alleles both
genes significantly resistant pyrethroids compared those
expressing susceptible alleles, indicating allelic variation key 
resistance mechanism. furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis functional
analyses demonstrated three amino acid changes (val109ile, asp335glu and
asn384ser) resistant allele cyp6p9b key pyrethroid resistance
mutations inducing high metabolic efficiency. detection first dna
markers metabolic resistance pyrethroids allows design dna-based
diagnostic tools detect track resistance associated bednets scale up,
which improve design evidence-based resistance management strategies.
