in regions coendemicity plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax where
mefloquine used treat p. falciparum infection, drug pressure mediated by
increased copy numbers multidrug resistance 1 gene (pvmdr1) may select for
mefloquine-resistant p. vivax surveillance undertaken routinely owing in
part methodological challenges detection gene amplification. using
genomic data 88 p. vivax samples western thailand, identified pvmdr1
amplification 17 isolates, exhibiting tandem copies 37.6-kilobase
pair region identical breakpoints. novel breakpoint-specific polymerase
chain reaction assay designed detect amplification. assay
demonstrated high sensitivity, identifying amplifications 13 additional,
polyclonal infections. application 132 samples identified common
breakpoint years tested (2003-2015), decline prevalence after
2012 corresponding local discontinuation mefloquine regimens. assessment of
the structure pvmdr1 amplification geographic regions yield
information population-specificity breakpoints underlying
amplification mechanisms.
