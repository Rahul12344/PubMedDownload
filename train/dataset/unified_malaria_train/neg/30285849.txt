background: within plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), 
n-terminal block 2 region highly polymorphic target naturally acquired
antibody responses. antigenic diversity determined complex repeat
sequences well non-repeat sequences, grouping three major allelic
types appear maintained within populations natural selection.
within major types, many distinct allelic sequences described 
different studies, extent significance diversity remains
unresolved.
methods: survey diversity extensively, block 2 allelic sequences in
the msp1 gene characterized 2400 p. falciparum infection isolates with
whole genome short read sequence data available pf3k project, and
compared data previous studies.
results: mapping short read sequence data 2400 isolates reference
library msp1 block 2 allelic sequences yielded 3815 allele scores level
of major allelic family types, 46% isolates containing two of
these major types. overall frequencies similar previously reported 
in samples different methods, k1-like allelic type most
common africa, mad20-like common southeast asia, ro33-like being
the third abundant type continent. rare mr type, formed by
recombination mad20-like ro33-like alleles, seen africa
and rarely indian subcontinent southeast asia. a
combination mapped short read assembly approaches enabled 1522 complete msp1
block 2 sequences determined, among 363 different allele
sequences, 246 described previously. data, the
k1-like msp1 block 2 alleles diverse encode 225 distinct amino acid 
sequences, compared 123 different mad20-like, 9 ro33-like 6 mr type
sequences. within major types, different allelic sequences show
highly skewed geographical distributions, common sequences 
being detected either africa asia, both.
conclusions: allelic sequences extremely polymorphic locus been
derived whole genome short read sequence data mapping reference
library followed assembly mapped reads. catalogue sequence variation
has greatly expanded, 500 different msp1
block 2 allelic sequences described. provides extensive reference for
molecular epidemiological genotyping sequencing studies, potentially 
design multi-allelic vaccine.
