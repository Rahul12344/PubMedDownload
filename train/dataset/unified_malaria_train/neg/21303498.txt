background: dna prime, poxvirus (copak) boost vaccination regime four
antigens, i.e. combination two plasmodium knowlesi sporozoite (csp/ssp2) and
two blood stage (ama1/msp142) genes, leads self-limited parasitaemia 60% of
rhesus monkeys survival otherwise lethal infection p. knowlesi. 
in present study, role blood stage antigens protection was
studied depth, focusing antibody formation blood stage antigens
and functionality thereof.
methods: rhesus macaques immunized four-component vaccine and
subsequently challenged i.v. 100 p. knowlesi sporozoites. during
immunization challenge, antibody titres two blood stage antigens 
were determined, well vitro growth inhibition capacity those
antibodies. antigen reversal experiments performed determine relative
contribution antibodies two blood stage antigens the
inhibition.
results: vaccination, pkama1 pkmsp1₁₉ antibody titres vaccinated
animals low, reflected low levels inhibition these
antibodies determined vitro inhibition assays. interestingly, after
sporozoite challenge antibody titres blood stage antigens boosted
over 30-fold protected protected animals. vitro inhibition
levels increased high levels (median inhibitions 59% 56% 6 mg/ml
total igg, respectively). growth inhibition levels significantly
different protected protected animals, ability control
infection appeared cannot explained gia levels. judged vitro antigen 
reversal growth inhibition assays, 85% inhibitory activity these
antibodies directed pkama1.
conclusions: first report demonstrates dna prime/poxvirus
boost vaccination regimen induces low levels malaria parasite growth
inhibitory antibodies, boosted high levels upon challenge. no
association could, however, established levels inhibitory
capacity vitro protection, either vaccination challenge.
