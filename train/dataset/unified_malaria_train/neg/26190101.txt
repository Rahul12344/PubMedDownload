invading pathogens trigger specific host responses, understanding which
might identify genes function pathogen recognition elimination. in
this study, performed trans-species expression quantitative trait locus
(ts-eqtl) analysis using genotypes plasmodium yoelii malaria parasite 
phenotypes mouse gene expression. significantly linked 1,054 host genes 
parasite genetic loci (lod score ≥ 3.0). using lod score patterns, produced
results differed direct expression-level clustering, grouped
host genes function related pathways, allowing functional prediction of
unknown genes. a proof principle, 14 15 randomly selected
genes predicted function type interferon (ifn-i) responses were
experimentally validated using overexpression, small hairpin rna knockdown, viral
infection, and/or infection knockout mice. study demonstrates an
effective strategy studying gene function, establishes functional gene
database, identifies regulators ifn-i pathways.
