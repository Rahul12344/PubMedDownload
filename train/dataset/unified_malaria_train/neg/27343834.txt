se36 antigen, derived serine repeat antigen 5 (sera5) plasmodium
falciparum, promising blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. designated as
bk-se36, se36 antigen formulated aluminum hydroxyl gel (ahg) and
produced good manufacturing practice (gmp) constraints. phase ib
clinical trial follow-up study uganda, risk malaria symptoms was
reduced 72% compared control group. although promising, number of
responders vaccine 6-20years-olds approximately 30% the
majority younger cohort. contrast phase ia clinical
trial response vaccine 100% japanese malaria naive adults. 
consideration importance involvement host genetic
factors may influence ability mount effective immune response to
vaccination well susceptibility malaria infection. we, therefore,
analyzed allelic polymorphism human leukocyte antigen (hla)-drb1 alleles using
sequence-based typing (sbt). study, drb1 alleles influence
antibody response bk-se36 vaccinees susceptibility clinical
malaria.
