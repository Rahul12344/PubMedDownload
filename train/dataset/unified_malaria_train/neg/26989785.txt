malaria parasites genus plasmodium diverse mammal hosts, infecting 
five mammalian orders old world, long considered absent 
diverse deer family (cervidae) new world mammals. a
description plasmodium parasite infecting single splenectomized
white-tailed deer (wtd; odocoileus virginianus) 1967 none been
reported since, proven challenge understanding malaria
parasite biogeography. using microscopy polymerase chain reaction, we
screened large sample native captive ungulate species across the
united states malaria parasites. found surprisingly high prevalence (up 
to 25%) extremely low parasitemia plasmodium parasites wtd throughout
the eastern united states. detect infections ungulate
species western wtd. also isolated parasites mosquito
anopheles punctipennis. morphologically, parasites resemble parasite
described 1967, plasmodium odocoilei. analysis cytochrome b gene
revealed two divergent plasmodium clades wtd representative species that
likely diverged 2.3 6 million years ago, concurrent arrival the
wtd ancestor north america across beringia. multigene phylogenetic analysis 
placed clades within larger malaria parasite clade. document
plasmodium parasites common wtd, endemic new world, the
only known malaria parasites deer (cervidae). findings reshape our
knowledge phylogeography malaria parasites suggest other
mammal taxa may harbor infection endemic occult malaria parasites.
