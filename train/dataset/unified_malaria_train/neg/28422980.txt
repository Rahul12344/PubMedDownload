multiple mechanisms genetic epigenetic variations within key gene
may play role malarial susceptibility response anti-malarial drugs in
the population. abcb1 one well-studied membrane transporter genes 
code p-glycoprotein (an efflux protein) whose effect malaria
disease predisposition susceptibility drugs remains understood. we
studied association single nucleotide variations human abcb1 that
influences function subjects uncomplicated complicated malaria
caused plasmodium falciparum (pf). global dna methylation abcb1 dna
promoter methylation levels performed along transcriptional response
and protein expression subjects malaria healthy controls. the
rs2032582 locus significantly associated complicated combined
malaria groups compared controls (p < 0.05). significant dna methylation 
difference noticed case control (p < 0.05). addition, global
dna methylation levels host dna inversely proportional parasitemia
in individuals pf infection. study also revealed correlation between
abcb1 dna promoter methylation rs1128503 rs2032582 polymorphisms in
malaria related increased expression abcb1 protein levels in
complicated malaria group (p < 0.05) compared uncomplicated malaria and
control groups. study provides evidence multiple mechanisms may
regulate role host abcb1 function mediate aetiology malaria
susceptibility, prognosis drug response. may clinical implications
and therapeutic application various malarial conditions.
