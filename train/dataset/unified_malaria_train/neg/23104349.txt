dna immunization gene gun variety infectious diseases yielded
promising results animal models. skin-based dna vaccination these
diseases attractive option clinic aid the
discovery optimization vaccine candidates. vaccination the
protozoan parasite plasmodium presents unique challenges: (a) most
parasite-associated antigens stage-specific; (b) antibodies capable of
neutralizing parasite probing mosquitoes be
available high titers order prevent infection liver; (c) immunity
to liver-stage infection needs absolute order prevent subsequent
blood-stage parasitemia. gene gun vaccination successfully used to
prevent infection mice rodent malaria strain p. berghei has
been employed macaque model human p. falciparum. dna plasmid delivery 
gene gun offers opportunity economically efficiently test novel
malaria vaccine candidates vaccination strategies, include the
evaluation novel molecular adjuvant strategies. describe the
procedures involved making delivering pre-clinical malaria dna vaccine
by gene gun well correct approach vivo evaluation the
vaccine. furthermore, discuss various approaches either already been
tested could employed improve dna vaccines malaria.
