implicated recent epidemics asia, america africa. cameroon, data 
these viruses fragmentary. purpose study determine the
frequency detection three viruses febrile patients douala,
cameroon. cross-sectional descriptive study conducted march to
april 2017 new-bell district hospital douala. blood samples were
collected febrile patients tested malaria infections using rapid
diagnostic test. plasma harvested later analyzed presence of
chikungunya, dengue zika viruses trioplex real-time rt-pcr centre
pasteur cameroon. total 114 participants included, 63.2%
were females, reflecting sex ratio (female/male) 1.7. median age 26 
years, range [0.25-81]. eight (7%) 114 participants infected with
dengue virus (denv) among 5 identified serotype 1. cases of
infection either zika virus chikungunya virus detected. three cases of
dengue-malaria co-infection (13%) recorded. association found between
socio-demographic factors dengue infection. phylogenetic analysis 
partial envelope e gene showed five denv serotype 1 samples belonged
to subtype v, similarly strains west african countries, particularly
those nigeria, senegal côte d'ivoire. study showed circulation 
of denv serotype 1 febrile patients raises alarm establishment
of sustained surveillance system detect cases prevent potential
outbreaks cameroon. existence dengue-malaria co-infections suggests
that surveillance arboviruses limited febrile, non-malarial
cases.
