malaria caused plasmodium falciparum results approximately 1 million annual
deaths worldwide, young children pregnant mothers highest risk.
disease severity might related parasite virulence factors, expression
profiling studies parasites test hypothesis hindered by
extensive sequence variation putative virulence genes preponderance of
host rna clinical samples. report application rna sequencing to
clinical isolates p. falciparum, using not-so-random (nsr) primers to
successfully exclude human ribosomal rna globin transcripts enrich for
parasite transcripts. using nsr-seq, confirmed earlier microarray studies
showing upregulation distinct subset genes parasites infecting
pregnant women, including encoding well-established pregnancy malaria
vaccine candidate var2csa. also describe subset parasite transcripts that
distinguished parasites infecting children infecting pregnant women
and confirmed observation using quantitative real-time pcr mass
spectrometry proteomic analyses. based putative functional properties,
we propose proteins could role childhood malaria
pathogenesis. study provides proof principle nsr-seq represents an
approach used study clinical isolates parasites causing severe 
malaria syndromes well blood-borne pathogens blood-related diseases.
