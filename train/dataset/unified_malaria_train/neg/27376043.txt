background: cell culture techniques many advantages investigation of
drug transport target organ like liver. hepg2 huh-7 two cell lines
available hepatoma used model hepatic drug transport.
the present study aimed analyze expression level several drug
transporter genes two hepatoma cell lines, hepg2 huh-7 response 
to inhibitors.
materials methods: vitro study using hepg2 huh-7 cells. the
expression level following drug transporter genes quantified:
p-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein 1, organic anionic transporter
protein 1b1 (oatp1b1) organic cationic transporter-1 (oct1). ribonucleic acid
was extracted cells using tripure isolation reagent, gene
expression level transporters quantified using applied biosystems
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. verapamil
(p-glycoprotein inhibitor), nelfinavir (oatp1b1 inhibitor), quinidine (oct1
inhibitor) used differentiate inhibitory properties agents
to transporter expressions hepg2 huh-7 cells.
results: huh-7 shows higher level p-glycoprotein, oatp1b1 oct1
expressions compared hepg2. verapamil reduces expressions of
p-glycoprotein hepg2 huh-7; nelfinavir reduces expression oatp1b1
in hepg2 huh-7; quinidine reduces oct1 gene expressions hepg2,
but huh-7 cells.
conclusion: study indicates hepg2 might suitable vitro
model huh-7 study drug transport hepatocytes involving drug
transporters.
