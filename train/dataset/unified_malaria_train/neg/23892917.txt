targeted genetic manipulation using homologous recombination method of
choice functional genomic analysis obtain detailed view gene function
and phenotype(s). development mutant strains targeted gene deletions,
targeted mutations, complemented gene function, and/or tagged genes provides
powerful strategies address gene function, particularly genetic
manipulations efficiently targeted gene locus interest using
integration mediated double cross homologous recombination. due very
high rates nonhomologous recombination, functional genomic analysis of
toxoplasma gondii previously limited absence efficient methods
for targeting gene deletions gene replacements specific genetic loci.
recently, abolished major pathway nonhomologous recombination type i
and type ii strains t. gondii deleting gene encoding ku80
protein(1,2). δku80 strains behave normally tachyzoite (acute) and
bradyzoite (chronic) stages vitro vivo exhibit essentially 100%
frequency homologous recombination. δku80 strains make functional genomic 
studies feasible single gene well genome scale(1-4). here, we
report methods using type type ii δku80δhxgprt strains advance gene 
targeting approaches t. gondii. outline efficient methods generating
gene deletions, gene replacements, tagged genes targeted insertion or
deletion hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hxgprt)

of ways δku80 strains advance functional analysis parasite genome
and develop single strains carry multiple targeted genetic manipulations.
