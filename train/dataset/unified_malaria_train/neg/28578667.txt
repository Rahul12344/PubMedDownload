background: genus anopheles major mosquito group interest sri lanka as
it includes vectors malaria members exist species complexes.
taxonomy group mainly based morphological features, not
conclusive easily erased handling specimens. combined
effort, using morphology dna barcoding (using markers cytochrome c
oxidase subunit (coi) gene internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2) region, was
made present study recognize anophelines collected eight
districts sri lanka first time.
methods: cytochrome c oxidase subunit its2 regions morphologically
identified anopheline mosquitoes sri lanka sequenced. sequences
together genbank sequences used phylogenetic tree construction and
molecular characterization mosquitoes.
results: according morphological identification, field-collected adult
mosquitoes belonged 15 species, i.e., anopheles aconitus, anopheles annularis,
anopheles barbirostris, anopheles culicifacies, anopheles jamesii, anopheles
karwari, anopheles maculatus, anopheles nigerrimus, anopheles pallidus, anopheles
peditaeniatus, anopheles pseudojamesi, anopheles subpictus, anopheles
tessellatus, anopheles vagus, anopheles varuna. however, analysis 123 coi 
sequences (445 bp) (16 clades supported strong bootstrap value the
neighbour joining tree inter-specific distances of >3%) showed are
16 distinct species. identity morphologically identified species, except
an. subpictus, comparable dna barcoding results. coi sequence
analysis showed morphologically identified an. subpictus composed two 
genetic entities: an. subpictus species species b (inter-specific k2p
distance 0.128). four haplotypes an. culicifacies discovered during
the present study belonged single species. its2 sequences (542 bp) were
obtained species except an. barbirostris, an. subpictus species
b, an. tessellatus, an. varuna. sequences represented 
single species-specific haplotype.
conclusions: present study reflects importance feasibility coi and
its2 genetic markers identifying anophelines sibling species, and
the significance integrated systematic approach mosquito taxonomy. wide
distribution malaria vectors country perhaps indicates potential
for re-emergence malaria country.
