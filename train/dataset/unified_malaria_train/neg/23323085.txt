background: main goal present study detect polymorphism msp-1
gene major blood stage candidate vaccine plasmodium vivax by
single strand conformational polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (sscp-pcr).
methods: 2008 2010 fifty samples collected iranian patients
with p. vivax hormozgan province, southern iran. samples were
detected microscopical examination. amplification msp-1 gene done by
pcr dna extraction. single strand dnas due using sscp, was
electrophoresed polyacrylamid- bisacrylamid gel banding patterns were
revealed silver-staining method. sequencing typing method performed
for isolates.
results: 50 isolates positive microscopically. totally 12 (24%)
isolates showed 440 bp 38 (76%) showed 500 bp pcr assay. sscp analysis
revealed four banding patterns. pattern (10/50), pattern ii (12/50), pattern
iii (27/50), pattern iv (1/50). results sequencing analysis msp-1 
gene 19 isolates revealed diversity nucleotides amino acid iranian
p. vivax isolates.
conclusion: study confirms sscp-pcr rapid method detecting 
polymorphism msp-1 gene p. vivax. presence different haplotypes in
msp-1 gene shows several p. vivax strains exist malaria endemic areas 
iran.
