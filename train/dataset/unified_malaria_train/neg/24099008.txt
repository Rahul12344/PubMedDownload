intramembrane proteolysis widely conserved throughout different forms life,
with three major types proteases known ability cleave
peptide bonds directly within transmembrane domains substrates.
although intramembrane proteases extensively studied humans and
model organisms, recently investigated protozoan
parasites, turn play important sometimes unexpected roles. 
signal peptide peptidases involved endoplasmic reticulum (er) quality
control signal peptide degradation exported proteins. recent studies
suggest repurposing inhibitors developed blocking presenilins may be
useful inhibiting growth plasmodium, possibly protozoan
parasites, blocking signal peptide peptidases. rhomboid proteases, originally 
described fly, also widespread parasites, especially
expanded apicomplexans. study parasites revealed novel roles that
expand understanding proteases function. within diverse
group parasites, rhomboid proteases contribute processing adhesins
involved attachment, invasion, intracellular replication, phagocytosis, and
immune evasion, placing vertex host-parasite interactions. this
article part special issue entitled: intramembrane proteases.
