objective: loss cognition even survival salient feature of
cerebral malaria (cm). currently, fate neuronal morphology studied 
at ultrastructural level cm. recent studies suggest maintenance of
neuronal morphology dendritic spine density (actin dynamics particular)
are essential proper cognitive function. limk-1/cofilin-1 signaling pathway
is known involved maintenance actin dynamics regulation
of cofilin-1, executing learning memory functions.
methods: using experimental mouse model, analyzed behavioral parameters
of asymptomatic mice cm performing rapid murine coma behavior scale
experiment. performed golgi-cox staining assess neuronal morphology,
dendritic spine density, arborization brain cortex subjected plasmodium
berghei anka infection compared asymptomatic, anemic, control groups. we
studied neural gene expression pattern limk-1, cofilin-1, β-actin in
all experimental groups semiquantitative quantitative polymerase chain
reaction followed immunoblotting immunofluorescence.
results: observed significant loss dendritic spine density, abnormal spine 
morphology, reduced dendritic arborization, extensive dendritic varicosities 
in cortical neurons cm-infected brain. furthermore, observations
correlated diminished protein levels limk-1, cofilin-1,
phospho-cofilin-1, β-actin whole brain lysates well formation of
actin-cofilin rods brain sections symptomatic mice cm.
interpretation: overall, findings suggest altered neuronal
morphology dysregulation limk-1/cofilin-1 pathway could affect the
cognitive outcome experimental cm. therefore, study could help to
establish newer therapeutic strategies addressing long-term cognitive impairment 
after cm. ann neurol 2017;82:429-443.
