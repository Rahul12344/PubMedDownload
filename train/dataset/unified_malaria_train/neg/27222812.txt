the emergence distribution drug resistance malaria serious public
health concerns tropical subtropical regions world. however, the
molecular mechanism drug resistance remains unclear. present study, 
performed high-throughput rna-seq identify characterize the
differentially expressed genes chloroquine (cq) sensitive (3d7) and
resistant (dd2) strains plasmodium falciparum. parasite cells were
cultured presence absence cq vitro method. total rna was
isolated harvested parasite cells using trizol, rna-seq was
conducted using illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing platform paired-end reads 
and annotated using tophat. transcriptome analysis p. falciparum revealed 
the expression ~ 5000 genes, ~ 60% genes unknown
function. cuffdiff program used identify differentially expressed
genes cq-sensitive resistant strains. here, furnish detailed
description experimental design, procedure, analysis the
transcriptome sequencing data, deposited national center
for biotechnology information (accession nos. prjna308455 gse77499).
