malaria parasites invade red blood cells (rbcs), consume copious amounts of
hemoglobin, severely disrupt iron regulation humans. anemia often
accompanies malaria disease; however, iron supplementation therapy inexplicably
exacerbates malarial infections. found iron exporter ferroportin
(fpn) highly abundant rbcs, iron supplementation suppressed its
activity. conditional deletion fpn gene erythroid cells resulted in
accumulation excess intracellular iron, cellular damage, hemolysis, and
increased fatality malaria-infected mice. humans, prevalent fpn mutation,
q248h (glutamine histidine position 248), prevented hepcidin-induced
degradation fpn protected severe malaria disease. fpn q248h
appears positively selected african populations response to
the impact malaria disease. thus, fpn protects rbcs oxidative stress
and malaria infection.
