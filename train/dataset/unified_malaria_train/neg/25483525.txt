malaria transmission blocking vaccines (tbv) directed proteins expressed 
on sexual stages plasmodium falciparum mosquito midgut considered
an effective means reduce malaria transmission. antibodies induced tbv
block sporogonic development mosquito, thus transmission next
human host. pfs25 protein, expressed surface gametes, zygotes and
ookinetes, one primary targets tbv development. using plant
virus-based transient expression system, successfully produced pfs25
fused modified lichenase (lickm) carrier nicotiana benthamiana, purified 
and characterized protein (pfs25-fhcmb), evaluated vaccine candidate
in animal models induction transmission blocking antibodies. soluble
pfs25-fhcmb expressed plants high level, induced transmission
blocking antibodies persisted 6 months post immunization mice
and rabbits. data demonstrate potential new malaria vaccine
candidate also support feasibility expressing plasmodium antigens a
plant-based system.
