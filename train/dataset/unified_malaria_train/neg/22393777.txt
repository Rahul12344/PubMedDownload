artemisinin, sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived artemisia annua l.
(asteraceae), effective antimalarial drug. used two methods:
genome walking thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction, to
isolate unknown 5'-flanking sequence cyp71av1 gene. subsequent
sequence analysis using bioinformatics software revealed several
cis-acting elements inside cyp71av1 promoter. 5'-rapid amplification of
the cdna ends method used determine transcription start site the
cyp71av1 gene. mapped 18 base upstream atg initiation
codon. simple functional characterization, built fusion vectors between
the 5'-deletion promoter gas reporter gene. expression levels 
transferred vectors a. annua l. analyzed transient expression
way. beta-glucuronidase assay results indicated deletion region
to -1551 bp lead much damage gus activity, whereas further
deletion, -1155 bp, resulted 5.5-fold reduction gus activity. in
stabilized transgenic a. annua l. seedlings observed gus expression was
restricted trichomes, means promoter cyp71av1 gene is
trichome-specific. compared constitutive camv 35s promoter, can
express genes throughout plant, influence trichome system 
trichome-specific expression promoter merely imperils plant growth. addition, 
the promoter cyp71av1 gene contains several binding sites for
transcription factors, implies cyp71av1 promoter responds 
than one form stimulation.
