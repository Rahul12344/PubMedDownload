background: eimeria genus parasites phylum (apicomplexa) as
human parasites toxoplasma, cryptosporidium malaria parasite
plasmodium. apicomplexan whose life-cycle involves single host, eimeria
is convenient model understanding group organisms. although the
genomes apicomplexa diverse, eimeria unique being
composed large alternating blocks sequence different
characteristics - arrangement seen organism. arrangement 
impeded efforts fully sequence genome eimeria, remains last
of major apicomplexans fully analyzed. order increase value
of genome sequence data aid effort gain better understanding 
of eimeria tenella genome, constructed whole genome map the
parasite.
results: total 1245 contigs representing 70.0% whole genome assembly 
sequences (wellcome trust sanger institute) selected subjected marker
selection. subsequently, 2482 happy markers developed typed. these,
795 considered usable markers, utilized construction a
happy map. markers developed chromosomally-assigned genes then
integrated happy map aided assignment number of
linkage groups respective chromosomes. bac-end sequences contigs
from whole genome sequencing also integrated improve validate the
happy map. resulted integrated happy map consisting 60 linkage
groups covers approximately half estimated 60â€‰mb genome. further
analysis suggests segmental organization first seen chromosome 1 is
present throughout genome, repeat-poor (p) regions alternating with
repeat-rich (r) regions. evidence copy-number variation strains was
also uncovered.
conclusions: paper describes application whole genome mapping
method improve assembly genome e. tenella shotgun data, and
to help reveal overall structure. preliminary assessment copy-number
variation (extra missing copies genomic segments) strains e.
tenella also carried out. emerging picture unusual genome
architecture displaying inter-strain copy-number variation. suggest these
features may related known ability parasite rapidly develop 
drug resistance.
