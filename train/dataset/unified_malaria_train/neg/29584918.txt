background: overcoming antigenic diversity key challenge development 
of effective plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccines. strategies promote 
generation antibodies targeting conserved epitopes vaccine antigens may
provide protection diverse parasites strains. understanding differences
between vaccine-induced naturally acquired immunity important achieving
this goal.
methods: analyzed antibodies generated phase 1 human vaccine trial,
msp2-c1, included 2 allelic forms msp2, abundant vaccine antigen on
the merozoite surface. vaccine-induced responses assessed functional
activity multiple parasite strains, cross-reactivity antibodies
was determined using competition elisa epitope mapping approaches.
results: vaccination induced cytophilic antibody responses with
strain-transcending opsonic phagocytosis complement-fixing function. in
contrast antibodies acquired via natural infection, vaccine-induced antibodies
were directed towards conserved epitopes c-terminus msp2, whereas
naturally acquired antibodies mainly targeted polymorphic epitopes. functional
activity c-terminal-targeted antibodies confirmed using monoclonal
antibodies promoted opsonic phagocytosis multiple parasite strains.
conclusion: vaccination generated markedly different responses polymorphic
antigens naturally acquired immunity targeted conserved functional
epitopes. induction antibodies targeting conserved regions malaria antigens
provides promising vaccine strategy overcome antigenic diversity for
developing effective malaria vaccines.
