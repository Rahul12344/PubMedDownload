cationic nanoemulsions recently considered potential delivery
systems oligonucleotides (on) targeting plasmodium falciparum topoisomerase
ii gene. study aiming select best composition nanoemulsions
intended adsorption means 2(3) full factorial design. based on
their physicochemical properties, two formulations selected further
studies, composed medium chain triglycerides, egg-lecithin, either
oleylamine (oa) 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (dotap). adsorption
isotherms phosphodiester phosphorothioate optimized nanoemulsions
were obtained (ultrafiltration/centrifugation procedure). showed a
significant higher amount adsorbed dotap nanoemulsion compared to
the oa ones. langmuir adsorption model provides satisfactory
representation adsorption data. evidence adsorption could be
detected inversion ζ-potential morphology oil
droplets examined transmission electron microscopy. preliminary results
regarding hemolytic effect p. falciparum survival exposure optimized
formulations related physicochemical properties vitro
effects. overall results showed potential optimized nanoemulsions 
as non-viral carriers antisense malaria parasites.
