mosquitoes multifaceted innate immune system actively engaged in
warding various pathogens, including protozoan malaria parasite
plasmodium. various immune signaling pathways effectors shown to
mediate certain degree defense specificity different plasmodium
species. key pattern recognition receptor anopheles gambiae immune
system fibrinogen domain-containing immunolectin fbn9, been
shown transcriptonally induced plasmodium infection, mediate
defense rodent human malaria parasites bacteria. we
have studied defense specificity fbn9 using transgenic approach,
in fbn9 overexpressed fat body tissue blood meal 
a vitellogenin promoter. interestingly, vg-fbn9 transgenic mosquitoes showed 
increased resistance rodent parasite p. berghei, human
parasite p. falciparum, pointing differences mosquito's defense
mechanisms two parasite species. vg-fbn9 transgenic mosquitoes
were also resistant infection gram-positive gram-negative
bacteria showed increased longevity infected p. berghei. study 
points importance experimentally depleting enriching candidate
anti-plasmodium effectors functional studies order ascertain their
suitability development transgenic mosquito-based malaria control
strategies.
