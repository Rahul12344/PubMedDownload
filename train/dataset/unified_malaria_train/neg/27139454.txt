this study aimed elucidate aspects epidemiology blastocystis in
nigerian school children, including distribution subtypes (sts) st
alleles. total 199 genomic dnas extracted fecal samples 199
nigerian children aged 2-14 years tested real-time polymerase chain
reaction blastocystis positive dnas submitted barcoding pcr and
sequencing obtain information sts st alleles. total 167 (84%)
samples positive blastocystis, prevalence increasing age. no
association blastocystis colonization gender (p = 0.51) or
type/presence toilet facilities (p = 0.21) observed. blastocystis carriers
were prone using water collected wells sachets (p =
0.0044). moreover, blastocystis positivity associated positivity for
fecal-orally transmitted protozoa (p = 0.018) helminths (p < 0.0001). clear
inverse association blastocystis colonization malaria infection was
observed (p < 0.0001); however, malaria-positive children younger than
malaria-negative children, finding attributed age effect of
blastocystis colonization. st data available 127/167 (76%) samples.
fifty-one children positive st1, 42 33 children colonized
with st2 st3, respectively; single case st7 observed. large, 
the st alleles identified st1 st2 differ observed in
humans regions world; meanwhile, distribution st3 alleles 
was remarkably distinct potentially specific humans sub-saharan africa.
