what known objective: genetic polymorphism one important
factors responsible interindividual interethnic variability drug
response. studies major populations, ie, caucasians, asians, africans,
have provided evidence differences genotype frequencies major
drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome p450 (cyp). study aimed review
systematically, relevant articles related genetic polymorphisms in
cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6 cyp3a5 south-east east asian (seea)
populations.
methods: articles report genetic polymorphisms, genotype frequencies and
allele frequencies cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6 cyp3a5 retrieved 
pubmed database.
results discussions: total 86 studies fulfilled eligibility
criteria representing different ethnic populations seea, ie, burmese, chinese,
japanese, karen ethnic minority, korean, malaysian, philippino, singaporean,
taiwanese, thai, indonesian, vietnamese, included analysis. in
general, genotype frequencies across seea populations comparable. the
cyp2c9*1/*1 (69.3%-99.1%), *1/*3 (2.3%-20.1%) *3/*3 (0%-2.2%) genotypes are
reported seea populations. six major cyp2c19 genotypes, ie, *1/*1
(6.25%-88.07%), *1/*2 (21.5%-86.46%), *1/*3 (0.8%-15.8%), *2/*2 (3.4%-14.5%),
*2/*3 (0%-7.3%) *3/*3 (0%-10.2%), reported seea populations.
major cyp2d6 genotypes include *10/*10 (0%-69.6%), *1/*1 (0%-61.21%) *1/*10
(0%-62.0%). major cyp3a5 genotypes *3/*3 (2.0%-71.4%), *1/*3 (16.0%-57.1%)
and *1/*1 (0%-82.0%). genotyping abnormal genotypes cyp2c9 (*1/*3), cyp2c19
(*1/*2, *1/*3), cyp3a5 (*1/*3) cyp2d6 (*5/*10) associated im
(intermediate metabolizer) status, may clinically beneficial seea
populations. similarly, cyp2c19 (*2/*2, *2/*3), cyp2d6 (*5/*5 ) linked pm
(poor metabolizer), cyp2d6 (*10/*10, *1/*5 lesser extent *1/*4, *2/*5,
*10/*41, *10/*49, *10/*14) cyp3a5 (*1/*1) associated em (extensive
metabolizer).
what new conclusion: sufficient number studies provided comparable 
results general. review suggests comparable genotype frequencies 
cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6 cyp3a5 exist among seea populations. noted 
that research data reported east asians compared south-east
asians. concerned efforts required establish partnerships among seea
countries ensure sufficient data south-east asian countries 
will assist establishing databases seea populations.
