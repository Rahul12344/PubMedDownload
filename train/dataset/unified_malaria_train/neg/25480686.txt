the surrounding capsule streptococcus pneumoniae identified a
major virulence factor targeted pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (pcv). 
however, nonencapsulated s. pneumoniae (non-ec-sp) also isolated
globally, mainly carriage studies. unknown non-ec-sp evolve
sporadically, high antibiotic nonsusceptiblity rates unique,
specific gene content. here, whole-genome sequencing 131 non-ec-sp isolates
sourced 17 different locations around world performed. results
revealed deep-branching classic lineage distinct multiple sporadic
lineages. sporadic lineages clustered previously sequenced, global
collection encapsulated s. pneumoniae (ec-sp) isolates classic
lineage comprised mainly frequently identified multilocus sequences
types (sts) st344 (n = 39) st448 (n = 40). st344 nine st448 isolates 
had high nonsusceptiblity rates β-lactams antimicrobials. analysis
of accessory genome reveals classic non-ec-sp contained increased
number mobile elements, ec-sp sporadic non-ec-sp. performing
adherence assays human epithelial cells selected classic sporadic
non-ec-sp revealed presence integrative conjugative element (ice)
results increased adherence human epithelial cells (p = 0.005). in
contrast, sporadic non-ec-sp lacking ice greater growth vitro possibly
resulting improved fitness. conclusion, non-ec-sp isolates classic
lineage evolved separately. spread globally, well adapted to
nasopharyngeal carriage able coexist ec-sp. due continued use 
of pcv, non-ec-sp may become prevalent.
