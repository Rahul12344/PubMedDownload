the mosquito midgut represents first barrier encountered plasmodium
parasite (haemosporida: plasmodiidae) ingested blood an
infected vertebrate. previous studies identified aedes aegypti (l.) (diptera:
culicidae) mucin-like (aeimuc1) short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (sdr)
genes midgut-expressed candidate genes influencing susceptibility infection
by plasmodium gallinaceum (brumpt). used rna inference (rnai) by
double-stranded rna (dsrna) injections examine ookinete survival oocyst
stage following individual gene knock-downs. double-stranded rna gene knock-downs
were performed 3 days prior p. gallinaceum infection oocyst development
was evaluated 7 days post-infection. mean numbers parasites developing to
the oocyst stage significantly reduced 52.3% dsaeimuc1-injected
females 36.5% dssdr-injected females compared females injected
with dsβ-gal control. prevalence infection significantly reduced 
dsaeimuc1- dssdr-injected females compared females injected with
dsβ-gal; reductions resulted two- three-fold increase the
number uninfected individuals, respectively. overall, results suggest
that aeimuc1 sdr play role ae. aegypti vector competence p.
gallinaceum.
