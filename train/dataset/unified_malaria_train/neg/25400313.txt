unicellular eukaryotes, protists, among ancient organisms on
earth. protists belong multiple taxonomic groups; widely distributed 
geographically environments. ability discriminate among con- 
and heterospecifics documented past decade. discuss
exemplar cases taxa-, clone-, possible kin-discrimination five major
lineages: mycetozoa (dictyostelium, polysphondylium), dikarya (saccharomyces),
ciliophora (tetrahymena), apicomplexa (plasmodium) archamoebae (entamoeba).
we summarize proposed genetic mechanisms involved discrimination-mediated 
aggregation (self versus different), including csa, flo trg (formerly
lag) genes, proliferation activation factors (pafs), facilitate
clustering protistan taxa. caution experimental challenges
