background: parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) extensively employed as
malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts). moreover, well-known drug target
candidate. however, genetic diversity gene might influence
performance rdt kits drug target candidacy. study aimed to
determine polymorphism pldh gene iranian isolates p. vivax p.
falciparum.
methods: genomic dna extracted whole blood microscopically confirmed 
p. vivax p. falciparum infected patients. pldh gene p. falciparum p.
vivax amplified using conventional pcr 43 symptomatic malaria patients
from sistan baluchistan province, southeast iran 2012 2013.
results: sequence analysis 15 p. vivax ldh showed fourteen 100% identity
with p. vivax sal-1 belem strains. two nucleotide substitutions detected
with one resulted amino acid change. analysis p. falciparum ldh
sequences showed six seven sequences 100% homology p. falciparum 
3d7 mzr-1. moreover, pfldh displayed three nucleotide changes resulted
in changing one amino acid. pvldh pfldh showed 75%-76% nucleotide and
90.4%-90.76% amino acid homology.
conclusion: pldh gene iranian p. falciparum p. vivax isolates displayed 
98.8-100% homology 1-3 nucleotide substitutions. indicated gene
was relatively conserved. additional studies done weather genetic
variation influence performance pldh based rdts not.
