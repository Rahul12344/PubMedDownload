the laverania clade comprises human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum as
well least seven additional parasite species infect wild african apes.
a recent analysis laverania genome sequences (otto td, et al. 2018. genomes of
all known members plasmodium subgenus reveal paths virulent human
malaria. nat microbiol. 3: 687-697) reported three instances interspecies gene
transfer, one previously described. generating gene sequences
from additional ape parasites re-examining sequencing reads generated 
otto et al. study, identified one newly described gene transfers 
assembly artifact sequences derived sample coinfected two parasite
species. second gene transfer ancestors two divergent chimpanzee
parasite lineages confirmed, involved much larger number genes 
originally described, many encode exported proteins remodel, or
bind to, erythrocytes. successful hybridization laverania species
is rare, important determine extent gene
transfers shaped host interactions.
