in last decade, upsurge interest developing malaria
rapid diagnostic test (rdt) kits detection plasmodium species. three
antigens - plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2), plasmodial
aldolase plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) - currently used for
rdts. tests targeting hrp2 contribute 90% malaria rdts in
current use. however, specificities, sensitivities, numbers false
positives, numbers false negatives temperature tolerances tests
vary considerably, illustrating difficulties challenges facing current
rdts. paper describes recent developments malaria rdts, reviewing rdts
detecting pfhrp2, pldh plasmodial aldolase. difficulties associated 
rdts, genetic variability pfhrp2 gene persistence of
antigens bloodstream following elimination parasites, are
discussed. prospect overcoming problems associated current rdts
with new generation alternative malaria antigen targets also described.
