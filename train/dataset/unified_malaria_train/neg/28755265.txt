the apicomplexan parasite plasmodium falciparum responsible global malaria
burden. reported resistance artemisinin chemotherapy, an
urgent need maintain early phase drug discovery identify novel drug
targets successful eradication pathogen host. previous
work comparative genomics study identification putative essential genes
and therapeutic candidates p. falciparum, predicted 11 proteins as
anti-malarial drug targets plasmodb database. paper, made an
attempt identification novel drug targets p. falciparum genome using 
sequence computational methods malaria parasite metabolic pathway
database. study reported identification 71 proteins potential drug 
targets anti-malarial interventions. furthermore, homology modeling and
molecular dynamic simulation study one potential drug targets,
aminodeoxychorismate lyase, carried predict 3d structure the
protein. structure ligand-based drug designing reported mmv019742 from
pathogen box tcams-141515 gsk-tcams library potential hits. the
reliability binding mode inhibitors confirmed gromacs a
simulation time 20Â ns water environment. helpful for
experimental validation small-molecule inhibitor.
