several lines evidence demonstrated organisms ranging bacteria to
higher animals possess regulated endonucleolytic cleavage pathway producing
half-trna fragments. present study, investigated occurrence this
phenomenon two distantly related apicomplexan parasites, toxoplasma gondii,
the agent toxoplasmosis, rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. a
low-scale molecular characterization small rna fraction t. gondii
revealed endonucleolytic processing 10 distinct trna species, with
cleavage anticodon loop upstream 3'-terminal cca sequence
yielding 5'- 3'-end half-trnas. t. gondii p. berghei exhibited variable
rates trna cleavage upon egress host cells response stage
differentiation, amino acid starvation heat-shock. moreover, avirulent
isolates t. gondii attenuated p. berghei parasites showed higher rate of
trna cleavage virulent strains. interestingly, half-trna production was
significantly higher metabolically quiescent bradyzoite sporozoite
stages t. gondii, compared fast-growing tachyzoite. collectively, our
findings shed light first time occurrence trna cleavage in
apicomplexan parasites suggest relationship half-trna production
and growth rate important group organisms.
