background: new world vultures (cathartiformes: cathartidae) obligate
scavengers comprised seven species five genera throughout americas. 
these, turkey vultures (cathartes aura) black vultures (coragyps atratus) are
the widespread and, although ecologically similar, evolved differences 
in morphology, physiology, behaviour. three species haemosporidians have
been reported new world vultures date: haemoproteus catharti, leucocytozoon
toddi plasmodium elongatum, although studies investigated
haemosporidian parasites important group species. study,
morphological molecular methods used investigate epidemiology and
molecular biology haemosporidian parasites new world vultures north
america.
methods: blood and/or tissue samples obtained 162 turkey vultures and
95 black vultures six states usa. parasites identified based on
their morphology blood smears, sequences mitochondrial cytochrome b
and nuclear adenylosuccinate lyase genes obtained molecular
characterization.
results: parasites detected black vultures, whereas 24% turkey
vultures across sampling locations positive h. catharti blood
smear analysis and/or pcr testing. phylogenetic analysis cytochrome b gene
sequences revealed h. catharti closely related mycamh1, yet
unidentified haemosporidian wood storks (mycteria americana) southeastern
usa northern brazil. haemoproteus catharti mycamh1 represent clade that
is unmistakably separate haemoproteus spp., closely
related haemocystidium spp. reptiles plasmodium spp. birds
and reptiles.
conclusions: haemoproteus catharti widely-distributed parasite turkey
vultures north america evolutionarily distinct other
haemosporidian parasites. results reveal genetic diversity and
evolutionary relationships avian haemosporidians still uncovered,
and future studies combining comprehensive evaluation morphological life
cycle characteristics analysis multiple nuclear mitochondrial
genes useful redefine genus boundaries parasites to
re-evaluate relationships amongst haemosporidians birds, reptiles and
mammals.
