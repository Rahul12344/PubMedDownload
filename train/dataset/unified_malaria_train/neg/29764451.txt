background: thailand, artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) been
used treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria since 1995. unfortunately,
artemisinin resistance reported thailand southeast asian 
countries since 2003. malaroneÂ®, combination atovaquone-proguanil (atq-pg), 
has used cease artemisinin pressure areas along thai-cambodia
border, part artemisinin resistance containment project since 2009. this
study aimed determine genotypes phenotypes plasmodium falciparum
isolates collected thai-cambodia border artemisinin resistance
containment project compared collected before.
results: one hundred nine p. falciparum isolates collected from
thai-cambodia border chanthaburi trat provinces 1988-2016 were
used study. these, 58 isolates collected containment.
these parasite isolates characterized vitro antimalarial
sensitivities including chloroquine (cq), quinine (qn), mefloquine (mq),
piperaquine (ppq), artesunate (as), dihydroartemisinin (dha), atq pg and
genetic markers drug resistance including kelch13 (k13), plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), p. falciparum multidrug
resistance 1 (pfmdr1) cytochrome b (cytb) genes. mean cq, qn, mq, ppq 
ic50s parasite isolates collected 2009 2016 exhibited
significantly higher parasites collected 2009. approximately
57% exhibited vitro mq resistance. approximately 94% isolates collected
from 2009 2016 contained pfmdr1 184f allele. mutations k13 gene
were detected approximately 90% parasites collected 2009 2016
which significantly higher parasite isolates collected before. no
atq-resistant genotype phenotype p. falciparum found among the
isolates collected containment project.
conclusions: although containment project implemented area, 
the expansion artemisinin-resistant parasites decline. addition,
reduced sensitivity partner drugs act including mq ppq were
identified.
