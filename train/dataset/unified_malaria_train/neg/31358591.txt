angola main origin country imported malaria henan province,
china. antimalarial drug resistance posed threat control and
elimination malaria. several molecular markers confirmed associated
with antimalarial drug resistance, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, and
k13. study evaluated drug resistance 180 imported plasmodium
falciparum isolates angola via nested pcr using sanger sequencing. the
prevalences pfcrt c72v73m74n75k76, pfmdr1 n86y184s1034n1042d1246, pfdhfr
a16n51c59s108d139i164, pfdhps s436a437a476k540a581 69.4%, 59.9%, 1.3%
and 6.3%, respectively. three nonsynonymous (a578s, m579i, q613e) one
synonymous (r471r) mutation k13 found, prevalences 2.5%
and 1.3%, respectively. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pfcrt,
pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps generally shown multiple mutations. mutant
prevalence pfcrt reduced gradually, pfdhfr pfdhps still showed high
mutant prevalence, pfmdr1 relatively low. mutation k13 gene 
was rare. molecular surveillance artemisinin (art) resistance used 
a tool evaluate real-time efficacy artemisinin-based combination
therapies (acts) art resistance situation.
