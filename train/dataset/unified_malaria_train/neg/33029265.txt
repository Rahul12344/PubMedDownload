recent evidence suggests proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(pcsk9), downmodulator cellular uptake blood cholesterol, also negatively
impacts host immune response microbial infection. study, we
investigated whether carrying loss-of-function (lof) rs562556 (c.1420 a > g; 
p.i474 v) pcsk9 single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) affected outcome of
severe malaria children. archival dna cohort 207 malian children
suffering severe malaria genotyped rs562556 snp. sixty-four
children either heterozygous homozygous minor g allele
(carriers); 143 children homozygous common allele (noncarriers).
among carriers, one mortality case (1.6%), compared 15 cases (10.5%)
among noncarriers (p=0.0251), suggesting g allele associated with
better survival severe malaria. intriguingly, allele negatively
segregate clinical symptoms linked mortality cohort.
studies needed determine whether pcsk9 inactivation promotes protective 
immune response malaria infection.
