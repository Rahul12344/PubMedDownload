the apicoplast plasmodium essential organelle circular
genome must faithfully replicated segregated progeny during
parasite sporogony schizogony. dna replication proteins encoded by
its genome. instead, replication machinery must imported from
nuclear-encoded genes. likely apicoplast dna replication factor, pfprex, bears 
a bipartite leader sequence apicoplast trafficking contains several dna
replication-related enzymatic domains. analyze domain structure of
pfprex examine trafficking maturation within parasite. minimal 
primase domain pfprex shown contain functional zinc-binding and
toprim-fold domains, recombinant form sufficient produce rna
primers single-stranded dna template. pfprex shown extensively
proteolytically matured within parasite, effectively separates its
functional domains. gene targeting attempts knockout plasmodium yoelii
ortholog prex unsuccessful, indicating apparent essentiality 
protein parasite. finally, overexpression plasmodium falciparum of
pfprex's trafficking primase sequences yielded specific dynamic
localization foci within apicoplast. taken together, observations
strongly suggest essential role pfprex primase production rna
primers lagging strand dna synthesis apicoplast genome.
