sporozoite forms malaria parasite plasmodium transmitted mosquitoes
and first infect liver initial round replication parasite
proliferation blood. molecular mechanisms involved sporozoite
invasion hepatocytes remain poorly understood. previous studies, two
receptors hepatitis c virus (hcv), tetraspanin cd81 scavenger 
receptor bi (sr-bi), shown play important role entry of
plasmodium sporozoites hepatocytic cells. contrast hcv entry, which
requires cd81 sr-bi together additional host factors, cd81 and
sr-bi operate independently malaria liver infection, sporozoites can
use cd81 and/or sr-bi, depending plasmodium species, invade
hepatocytes. however, molecular function cd81 sr-bi parasite
entry remains unknown. another hcv entry factor, ephrin receptor a2 (epha2), 
was recently reported play key role host cell entry factor during
malaria liver infection. here, investigated contribution epha2 during
cd81-dependent sr-bi-dependent sporozoite infection. using small interfering 
rna (sirna) antibodies epha2, combined direct detection of
parasites flow cytometry microscopy, show blocking epha2 no
significant impact p. yoelii p. berghei host cell infection, irrespective
of entry route. thus, findings argue important role epha2
during malaria liver infection.
