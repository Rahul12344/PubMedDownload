compared eukaryotic cell types, malaria parasites appear possess 
more rudimentary golgi apparatus composed dispersed, unstacked cis and
trans-cisternae. despite playing central role secretory pathway the
parasite, plasmodium golgi resident proteins characterised. 
previously identified new golgi resident protein unknown function, 
had named golgi protein 1, show forms complex previously
uncharacterised transmembrane protein (golgi protein 2, gp2). golgi protein
complex localises cis-golgi throughout erythrocytic cycle and
potentially also mosquito stages. analysis parasite strains where
gp1 expression conditionally repressed and/or gp2 gene inactivated
reveals though golgi protein complex essential stage of
the parasite life cycle, important optimal asexual development the
blood stages.
