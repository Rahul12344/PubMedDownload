background: lack effective economical control strategy
against malaria (the devastating infectious disease developing countries)
transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) concept raised recent years,
promising efficient way malaria control. tbvs aim interfering and/or
blocking pathogen development within vector, halting transmission to
non-infected vertebrate host. aminopeptidase n (apn) one potent
proteins parasite development anopheles malaria vectors, strongly 
co-localized human malaria parasites mosquito midgut epithelium.
therefore, aminopeptidase n one best choices new tbv.
methods: study first time used 3'-race amplify apn gene 
anopheles stephensi (an.stephensi), major malaria vector iran, indian
subcontinent china using different sets primers including exon
junction, conserved specific region primers.
results: full length apn sequenced stepwise, could applied in
designing new regional tbv act essential component malaria
elimination program an.stephensi distribution areas.
conclusion: primers design method modification set exactly in
approach based amplifications. results came conclusion 
3'-race could applied amplified key regions beyond reach.
