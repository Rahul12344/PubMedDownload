background: plasmodium falciparum malaria public health problem worldwide.
malaria treatment policy faced periodic changes due emergence drug
resistant parasites. sudan chloroquine replaced artesunate and
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (as/sp) 2005 artemether-lumefantrine (al) 
2017, due development drug resistance. different molecular markers have
been used monitor status drug resistant p. falciparum. study aimed
to determine frequency malaria drug resistance molecular markers in
southeast sudan.
methods: samples study day zero dried blood spot samples
collected efficacy studies blue nile state november 2015 to
january 2016. total 130 samples amplified sequenced using illumina 
miseq platform. molecular markers included pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr,
pfdhps, pfk13, exonuclease artemisinin resistant (art-r) genetic background
(pfmdr2, ferroredoxine, pfcrt pfarps10).
results: resistance markers chloroquine detected 25.8% samples
as mutant haplotype pfcrt 72-76 cviet 21.7% pfmdr1 86y. pfdhfr mutations were
detected codons 51, 59 108. icni double-mutant haplotype 
prevalent (69%). pfdhps mutations detected codons 436, 437, 540, 581 
613. sgega triple-mutant haplotype prevalent (43%). in
pfdhfr/pfdhps combined mutation, quintuple mutation icni/sgega most
frequent one (29%). six seven treatment failure samples quintuple
mutation seventh quadruple. significantly higher the
adequately responsive group (p < 0.01). pfk13 novel mutations found 7
(8.8%) samples, linked artemisinin resistance. mutations in
art-r genetic background genes ranged zero 7%. exonuclease mutation was
not detected.
conclusion: study, moderate resistance chloroquine high resistance
to sp observed. novel mutations pfk13 gene linked treatment failure
were described. resistance piperaquine partner drug of
dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (dha-ppq).
