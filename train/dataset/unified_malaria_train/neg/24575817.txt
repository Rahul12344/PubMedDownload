the marine streptomyces sp. cnq-617 produces two diastereomers, marineosins and
b. structurally related alkyl prodiginines, complex 
cyclization unusual spiroaminal skeleton. report identification 
the mar biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrate production marineosins
through heterologous expression s. venezuelae host named jnd2. mar
cluster shares gene organization high homology genes of
the red cluster (which directs biosynthesis undecylprodiginine) but
contains additional gene, named mara. replacement mara jnd2 strain
leads accumulation premarineosin, identical marineosin with
the exception middle pyrrole (ring b) reduced. final
step marineosin pathway thus mara catalyzed reduction ring.
replacement marg (a homologue redg directs undecylprodiginine
cyclization give streptorubin b) jnd2 strain leads loss all
spiroaminal products accumulation 23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine a
shunt product, 23-ketoundecylprodiginine. marg thus catalyzes penultimate
step marineosin pathway catalyzing conversion of
23-hydroxyundecylprodiginine premarineosin. preceding steps the
biosynthetic marineosin pathway likely mirror red-directed
biosynthetic process, exception introduction hydroxyl
functionality required spiroaminal formation. work presents first
experimentally supported scheme biosynthesis marineosin provides new
biologically active molecule, premarineosin.
