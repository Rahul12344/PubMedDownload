background: mice exposed sand fly saliva protected against
vector-transmitted leishmania major. although protection related to
ifn-γ producing cells, early inflammatory response orchestrating this
outcome defined.
methodology/principal findings: mice exposed uninfected p. duboscqi bites 
naïve mice challenged l. major-infected flies characterize their
early immune response bite site. mostly, chemokine cytokine transcript
expression post-infected bites amplified exposed compared naïve mice.
in exposed mice, induced chemokines mostly involved leukocyte recruitment
and cell nk cell activation; il-4 expressed 6 h followed ifn-γ
and inos2 well il-5 il-10 expression. naïve animals, transcript 
expression following leishmania-infected sand fly bites suppressed.
expression profiles translated earlier significantly larger recruitment
of leukocytes including neutrophils, macrophages, gr+ monocytes, nk cells and
cd4+ cells bite site exposed compared naïve mice post-infected
bites. additionally, 48 hours post-infected bites number of
ifn-γ-producing cd4+ cells nk cells arriving bite site was
significantly higher exposed compared naïve mice. thereafter, nk cells
become cytolytic persist bite site week post-bite.
conclusion/significance: quiet environment induced leishmania-infected
sand fly bite naïve mice significantly altered animals previously
exposed saliva uninfected flies. propose enhanced recruitment
of gr+ monocytes, nk cells cd4 th1 cells observed bite site exposed
mice creates inhospitable environment counters establishment l.
major infection.
