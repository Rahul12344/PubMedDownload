background: recent malaria epidemics kwazulu-natal indicate effective
anti-malarial therapy essential malaria control. although
artemether-lumefantrine used first-line treatment uncomplicated
plasmodium falciparum malaria northern kwazulu-natal since 2001, efficacy 
has assessed since 2002. objectives study quantify
the proportion patients treated uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria with
artemether-lumefantrine failed treatment 28 days, determine 
prevalence molecular markers associated artemether-lumefantrine and
chloroquine resistance.
methods: observational cohort 49 symptomatic patients, diagnosed with
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria rapid diagnostic test, blood taken for
malaria blood films p. falciparum dna polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
following diagnosis, patients treated artemether-lumefantrine
(coartemÂ®) invited return health facility 28 days repeat 
blood film pcr. pcr p. falciparum positive samples analysed for
molecular markers lumefantrine chloroquine resistance.
results: 49 patients recruited basis positive rapid diagnostic
test, 16 confirmed p. falciparum pcr. follow-up, 14 
pcr-negative malaria, one lost follow-up one blood specimen had
insufficient blood pcr analysis. 16 pcr-confirmed malaria carried 
a single copy multi-drug resistant (mdr1) gene, wild type
asparagine allele mdr1 codon 86 (mdr1 86n). ten 16 samples carried the
wild type haplotype (cvmnk) codons 72-76 chloroquine resistance
transporter gene (pfcrt); three samples carried resistant cviet allele; one
carried resistant wild type, two samples allele could not
be analysed.
conclusions: absence mdr1 gene copy number variation detected this
study suggests lumefantrine resistance yet emerge kwazulu-natal. in
addition, data investigation implies possible re-emergence of
chloroquine-sensitive parasites. results study must viewed with
caution, given extremely small sample size. larger study needed to
accurately determine therapeutic efficacy artemether-lumefantrine and
resistance marker prevalence. high proportion rapid diagnostic test
false-positive results requires investigation.
