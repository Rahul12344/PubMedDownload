to develop public-health policies extend lifespan affordable
anti-malarial drugs effective treatment options, necessary understand
the evolutionary processes leading origin spread mutations
conferring drug resistance malarial parasites. built population-genetic
model emergence resistance combination drug therapy.
reproductive cycles parasites specified absolute fitness
determined clinical parameters, thus coupling evolutionary-genetic with
population-dynamic processes. initial mutations confer partial
drug-resistance. therefore, mutant parasites rarely survive combination therapy
and within-host competition weak among parasites. model focuses on
the early phase unsuccessful recurrent mutations. ends rare
event mutants enriching infected individual successful
spread resistance entire population initiated. computer
simulations, waiting time establishment resistant parasites is
analysed. resistance spreads quickly following first appearance host
infected predominantly mutant parasites. occurs either rare
transmission resistant parasite uninfected host rare
failure drugs removing "transient" mutant alleles. emergence of
resistance delayed lower mutation rate, earlier treatment, higher
metabolic cost resistance, longer duration high drug dose, higher drug 
efficacy causing stronger reduction sensitive resistant parasites'
fitnesses. overall, contrary studies' proposition, current model
based absolute fitness suggests aggressive drug treatment delays the
emergence drug resistance.
