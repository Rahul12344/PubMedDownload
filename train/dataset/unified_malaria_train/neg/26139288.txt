the development efficacious plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine remains a
top priority global health. vaccination irradiated sporozoites able
to provide complete sterile protection action cd8(+) cells at
the liver-stage infection. however, method currently unsuitable for
large-scale deployment focus instead turned development of
sub-unit vaccines. sub-unit vaccine efforts traditionally focused two
well-known pre-erythrocytic antigens, csp trap, yet thousands genes are
expressed liver-stage. sought assess ability eight
alternative p. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens induce high proportion
of cd8(+) cells. show antigens, expressed individually 
non-replicating viral vectors chad63 mva, capable inducing immune
response mice. furthermore, also developed chimeric p. berghei parasites
expressing cognate p. falciparum antigen enable assessment efficacy 
mice. preliminary results indicate vectors encoding either pflsa1 or
pflsap2 capable inducing sterile protection dependent presence of
cd8(+) cells. work identified two promising p. falciparum liver-stage 
candidate antigens undergo testing humans.
