the malaria-causing parasite, plasmodium, contains unique non-photosynthetic
plastid known apicoplast. apicoplast essential organelle bound
by four membranes. although membrane transporters attractive drug targets,
only two transporters characterised malaria parasite apicoplast 
membranes. selected 27 candidate apicoplast membrane proteins, 20 are
annotated putative membrane transporters, performed genetic screen in
plasmodium berghei determine blood stage essentiality subcellular
localisation. eight apparently essential blood stage genes identified, three
of apicoplast-localised: pbanka_0614600 (dmt2), pbanka_0401200
(abcb4), pbanka_0505500. nineteen candidates could deleted blood
stage, four apicoplast-localised. interestingly, three
apicoplast-localised candidates lack canonical apicoplast targeting signal 
do contain conserved n-terminal tyrosines likely roles targeting. an
inducible knockdown essential apicoplast putative membrane transporter,
pfdmt2, viable supplemented isopentenyl diphosphate. knockdown
of pfdmt2 resulted loss apicoplast, identifying pfdmt2 crucial
apicoplast putative membrane transporter candidate therapeutic
intervention.
