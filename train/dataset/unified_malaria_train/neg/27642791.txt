a molecular understanding drug resistance mechanisms enables surveillance of
the effectiveness new antimicrobial therapies development and
deployment field. used conventional drug resistance selection well
as regime limiting dilution early stages drug treatment probe two
antimalarial imidazolopiperazines, kaf156 gnf179. latter approach permits
the isolation low-fitness mutants might otherwise out-competed 
selection. whole-genome sequencing 24 independently derived resistant
plasmodium falciparum clones revealed four parasites mutations known 
cyclic amine resistance locus (pfcarl) 20 mutations two
previously unreported p. falciparum drug resistance genes, acetyl-coa
transporter (pfact) udp-galactose transporter (pfugt). mutations were
validated vitro crispr editing p. falciparum vivo by
evolution resistant plasmodium berghei mutants. pfact pfugt were
localized endoplasmic reticulum fluorescence microscopy. mutations
in pfact pfugt conveyed resistance additional unrelated chemical
scaffolds, genes probably involved broad mechanisms antimalarial 
drug resistance.
