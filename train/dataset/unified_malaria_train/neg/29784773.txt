the development insecticide resistance african malaria vectors threatens
the continued efficacy important vector control methods rely limited
set insecticides. understand operational significance resistance 
require quantitative information levels resistance field populations 
to suite vector control insecticides. estimation resistance is
complicated sparsity observations field populations, variation in
resistance time space local regional scales, cross-resistance
between different insecticide types. using observations prevalence of
resistance mosquito species anopheles gambiae complex sampled from
1,183 locations throughout africa, applied bayesian geostatistical models to
quantify patterns covariation resistance phenotypes across different
insecticides. resistance three pyrethroids tested, deltamethrin,
permethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, found consistent forms covariation across
sub-saharan africa covariation resistance pyrethroids and
resistance ddt. found evidence resistance interactions between
carbamate organophosphate insecticides insecticides and
those classes. pyrethroids ddt found significant
associations predicted mean resistance observed frequency kdr 
mutations vgsc gene field mosquito samples, ddt showing the
strongest association. results improve capacity understand and
predict resistance patterns throughout africa guide development of
monitoring strategies.
