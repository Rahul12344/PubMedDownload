which organisms maintain generations. crispr/cas9, new versatile
genome editing tool recently tamed correct several disease causing genetic 
mutations spreading arms improve reproductive health. edit
harmful genetic mutations also applied control spread parasitic 
diseases like malaria introducing selfish genetic elements, propagated through
generations population via reproduction. applications made us review
the recent developments crisprs use reproductive biology.
