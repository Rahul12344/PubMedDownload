previous research demonstrates adhd considered risk factor for
covid-19. current study attempts investigate relationships between
infection, mortality recovery rates coronavirus prevalence of
adhd us statewide level. based information 2011 regarding the
prevalence adhd across us state, findings suggest that, are
no correlations adhd population size, infection mortality rates
from coronavirus, recovery rates (recovery-population ratio) rise the
prevalence adhd. consequently, possible explanation coping with
the disease, adhd might provide evolutionary advantage. example this
phenomenon found gene causes sickle-cell disease, which, 
non-dominant gene, helps cope infection malaria. corroborated,
research findings may support conclusion coronavirus limitations in
special educational frameworks adhd would required could be
relaxed.jel codes: h75, i12.
