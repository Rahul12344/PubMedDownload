recent studies shown plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites pailin 
province, along border thailand cambodia, become resistant
to artemisinin derivatives. better define epidemiology p. falciparum
populations assess risk possible spread parasites
outside pailin, new epidemiological tool named "focused screening and
treatment" (fsat), based active molecular detection asymptomatic parasite
carriers introduced 2010. cross-sectional malariometric surveys using pcr 
were carried 20 109 villages pailin province. individuals
detected p. falciparum carriers treated atovaquone-proguanil
combination plus single dose primaquine patient non-g6pd
deficient. interviews conducted elicit history cross-border travel
that might contribute spread artemisinin-resistant parasites. after
directly observed treatment, patients followed re-examined day 7
and day 28. among 6931 individuals screened, prevalence p. falciparum carriers
was less 1%, 96% asymptomatic. 1.6% individuals had
a travel history plans go outside cambodia, none tested being
positive p. falciparum. retrospective analysis, using 2010 routine
surveillance data, showed significant differences prevalence of
asymptomatic carriers discovered fsat villages classified "high
risk" "low risk" based malaria incidence data. positive individuals
treated followed-up day 28 cured. mutant-type allele related to
atovaquone resistance found. fsat potentially useful tool detect,
treat track clusters asymptomatic carriers p. falciparum along with
providing valuable epidemiological information regarding cross-border movements
of potential malaria parasite carriers parasite gene flow.
