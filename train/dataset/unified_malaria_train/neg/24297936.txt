the malaria parasite-resistance island (pri) african mosquito vector,
anopheles gambiae, mapped five genomic regions containing 80 genes, using 
coexpression patterns genomic blocks. high-throughput sequencing identified
347 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms within genes in
mosquitoes malaria-endemic areas kenya. direct association studies
between nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum
infection identified three naturally occurring genetic variations of
three genes (an. gambiae adenosine deaminase, fibrinogen-related protein 30, 
fibrinogen-related protein 1) associated significantly parasite
infection. role genes resistance phenotype confirmed by
rna interference knockdown assays. silencing fibrinogen-related protein 30
increased parasite infection significantly, whereas ablation of
fibrinogen-related protein 1 transcripts resulted mosquitoes nearly free of
parasites. discovered genes single-nucleotide polymorphisms are
anticipated useful development tools malaria control in
endemic areas africa.
