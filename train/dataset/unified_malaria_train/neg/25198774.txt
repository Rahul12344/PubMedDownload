plasmodium falciparum one deadliest protozoan parasite species among
those cause malaria. uncontrolled use antimalarial drugs resulted 
evolutionary selection pressure favoring high levels resistance to
antimalarials; currently p.falciparum shows resistance classes of
antimalarials. therefore essential identify novel drug targets, and
design selective anti-malarials overcome resistance. many drug
targets freely available various public domain resources, single
comprehensive source data containing easily searchable retrievable
information currently lacking. facilitate total integration mining 
of data emerging different drug consortia also prioritize drug
targets structure-based drug design, open-access, inclusive comprehensive 
database plasmodium falciparum established. meta data known/modeled
structures along binding site parameters drug targets included 
in database. additionally, chemical compounds showing positive inhibitory
assay plasmodium falciparum known drug targets also been
provided. database accessible http://pfaldb.jnu.ac.in. database
provides diverse information regarding structure, sequence, stage specific
gene expression, pathway, action mechanism, essentiality druggability for
each drug target, literature assess validation status individual
drug targets. also includes information individual anti-malarials with
their activity bioassay.
