retinoblastoma (rb) common primary intraocular malignancy in
children. intravitreal chemotherapy achieves favorable clinical outcomes in
controlling rb vitreous seeds, common reason treatment failure.
thus, novel, effective safe intravitreal chemotherapeutic drug urgently 
required. malaria drug artesunate (art) recently demonstrated remarkable
anticancer effects mild side effects. purpose study to
investigate anti-rb efficacy, underlying mechanism intraocular
safety art. herein, verified art inhibits rb cell viability and
induces cell apoptosis dose- time-dependent manner. microarray analysis 
revealed kruppel-like factor 6 (klf6) upregulated art treatment,
and confirmed real-time pcr western blot assays.
silencing klf6 expression significantly reversed art-induced rb cell growth
inhibition apoptosis. furthermore, art activated mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis rb cells, silencing klf6 expression significantly inhibited
this effect. murine xenotransplantation models rb, confirmed
that art inhibits rb tumor growth, induces tumor cell apoptosis upregulates
klf6 expression. addition, klf6 silencing attenuates art-mediated inhibition
of tumor growth vivo. furthermore, proved intravitreal injection of
art sprague-dawley (sd) rats safe, obvious retinal function damage 
or structural disorders observed electrophysiology (erg), fundal photographs, 
fundus fluorescein angiography (ffa) optical coherence tomography (oct)
examinations. collectively, study revealed art induces mitochondrial
apoptosis rb cells via upregulating klf6, results may extend the
application art clinic effective safe intravitreal
chemotherapeutic drug treat rb, especially rb vitreous seeds.
