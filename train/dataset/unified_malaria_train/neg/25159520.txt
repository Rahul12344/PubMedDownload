background: analysis single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) derived from
whole-genome studies allows rapid evaluation genome-wide diversity, and
genomic epidemiology studies plasmodium falciparum provide insights into
parasite population structure, gene flow, drug resistance vaccine
development. areas adequate cold chain facilities, large volumes of
leukocyte-depleted patient blood frozen use parasite genomic
analyses. remote endemic areas smaller volumes infected blood are
taken finger prick, dried stored filter paper. dried blood
spots generally yield enough concentrated parasite dna whole-genome
sequencing.
results: dna microarray designed use field samples type a
genome-wide set snps prior sequencing shown variable in
africa, southeast asia, papua new guinea. algorithm designed call
snps samples low parasite dna. new algorithm snp-calling
accuracy 98% measured hybridizing purified dna malaria lab strains
and comparing calls snps called full genome sequences. average
accuracy >98% likewise obtained dna extracted malaria field
samples collected studies southeast asia, average call rate >
82%.
conclusion: new high-density microarray provided high quality snp calls from
a wide range parasite dna quantities, represents robust tool for
genome-wide analysis malaria parasites diverse settings.
