avian malaria significant ecological importance serves model
system study broad patterns host switching host specificity. the
erythrocyte invasion mechanism malaria parasite plasmodium mediated, in
large part, proteins erythrocyte-binding-like (ebl) family genes.
however, little known genes conserved across different
species plasmodium, especially infect birds. using bioinformatical 
methods conjunction polymerase chain reaction (pcr) genetic
sequencing, identified annotated one member ebl family, merozoite
apical erythrocyte-binding ligand (maebl), chicken parasite plasmodium
gallinaceum. detected expression maebl p. gallinaceum pcr
analysis cdna isolated blood infected chickens. found that
maebl conserved orthologous gene avian, mammalian, rodent plasmodium 
species. duplicate extracellular binding domains maebl, responsible for
erythrocyte binding, conserved regions. combined data
corroborate conservation maebl throughout plasmodium genus may
help elucidate mechanisms erythrocyte invasion p. gallinaceum the
host specificity plasmodium parasites.
