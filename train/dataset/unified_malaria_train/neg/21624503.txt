genetic diversity population structure plasmodium vivax parasites are
valuable prediction origin spread novel variants within 
between populations, program evaluation malaria control measures.
using two polymorphic genetic markers, merozoite surface protein genes
pvmsp-3α pvmsp-3β, investigated genetic diversity four southeast
asian p. vivax populations, representing subtropical temperate strains
with dramatically divergent relapse patterns. pcr amplification pvmsp-3α and
pvmsp-3β genes detected three four major size polymorphisms among 235
infections examined, respectively, restriction analysis detected 15 19 
alleles, respectively. samples different geographical areas differed
dramatically pvmsp-3α pvmsp-3β allele composition frequency.
samples tended cluster basis pcr-rflp polymorphism. these
results indicated different parasite genotypes circulating each
endemic area, geographic isolation may exist. multiple infections were
detected four parasite populations, ranging 20.5% 31.8%, strongly 
indicating p. vivax populations highly diverse multiple clonal
infections common malaria-hypoendemic regions southeast asia.
