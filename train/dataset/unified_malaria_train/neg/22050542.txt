polymorphisms genes encode crucial signalling molecules been
proposed factors influence susceptibility to, outcome malaria. 
studied role mutation, c.1264 t>g, causes cd36 deficiency igg
responses msp-1₁₉ antigen malaria incidence. children genotyped for
the c.1264 t>g mutation beginning study using pcr-rflp. igg levels 
[optical density (od) readings] per cent seropositivity msp-1₁₉ were
determined baseline elisa. children followed 12 months for
acquisition anti-msp-1₁₉ igg antibody malaria incidence. observed a
significant increase production anti-msp-1₁₉ igg antibody normal and
heterozygous children 12 months follow-up, homozygous
mutants. normal children significantly lower malaria incidence rate
compared genotypes (χ² = 115.59; p < 0.01). conclude the
presence c.1264 t>g mutation leads cd36 deficiency closely
associated reduced igg production higher malaria incidence. most
likely deficiency cd36 known modulate dendritic cell function
suppresses production protective igg antibodies directed plasmodium
falciparum msp-1₁₉ antigen, predisposes acquisition clinical
malaria children.
