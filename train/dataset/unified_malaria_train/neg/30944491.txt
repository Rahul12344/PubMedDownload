apicomplexa group obligate intracellular parasites includes the
causative agents human diseases malaria toxoplasmosis.
apicomplexans evolved free-living phototrophic ancestors, this
transition parasitism occurred remains unknown. one potential clue lies in
coral reefs, environmental dna surveys uncovered several lineages
of uncharacterized basally branching apicomplexans1,2. reef-building corals 
a well-studied symbiotic relationship photosynthetic symbiodiniaceae
dinoflagellates (for example, symbiodinium3), identification key
microbial symbionts corals proven challenging4,5. use
community surveys, genomics microscopy analyses identify apicomplexan
lineage-which informally name 'corallicolids'-that found high
prevalence (over 80% samples, 70% genera) across major groups of
corals. corallicolids second abundant coral-associated
microeukaryotes symbiodiniaceae, therefore core members 
coral microbiome. situ fluorescence electron microscopy confirmed that
corallicolids live intracellularly within tissues coral gastric
cavity, possess apicomplexan ultrastructural features. sequenced
the genome corallicolid plastid, lacked genes photosystem
proteins; indicates corallicolids probably contain non-photosynthetic
plastid (an apicoplast6). however, corallicolid plastid differs all
other known apicoplasts retains four ancestral genes are
involved chlorophyll biosynthesis. corallicolids thus share characteristics
with parasitic free-living relatives, suggests that
they evolutionary intermediates implies existence unique
biochemistry transition phototrophy parasitism.
