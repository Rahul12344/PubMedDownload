the severe form human malaria caused plasmodium falciparum. its
virulence closely linked increase rigidity infected erythrocytes 
and adhesion endothelial receptors, obstructing blood flow vital
organs. unlike human-infecting plasmodium species, p. falciparum exports 
family 18 fikk serine/threonine kinases host cell, suggesting that
phosphorylation may modulate erythrocyte modifications. reveal substantial
species-specific phosphorylation erythrocyte proteins p. falciparum not
by plasmodium knowlesi, export fikk kinases. conditionally
deleting fikk kinases combined large-scale quantitative
phosphoproteomics identified unique phosphorylation fingerprints each
kinase, including phosphosites parasite virulence factors host erythrocyte
proteins. despite non-overlapping target sites, network analysis revealed
that fikks may act pathways. deletion the
non-exported kinase fikk8 resulted reduced parasite growth, suggesting the
exported fikks may instead support functions important survival host. 
we show one kinase, fikk4.1, mediates rigidification erythrocyte
cytoskeleton trafficking adhesin key virulence factor pfemp1 to
the host cell surface. establishes fikk family important drivers of
parasite evolution malaria pathology.
