most mosquito species display host preferences crucial determinant 
the transmission rate mosquito-borne pathogens. although transgenic
approach, based driving genes zoophily vector populations, been
advocated malaria control strategy world health organization since
1982, genes involved mosquito host choice remain poorly understood. culex 
pipiens pallens coquillet mosquitoes artificially selected two different
host preferences specially designed experimental enclosure. 3,035
mosquitoes obtained larvae pupae collected wild (the f0
generation), 27% preferentially fed pigeons 16% fed mice. following
artificial selection host preferences successive generations, 
percentage mosquitoes preferred feed pigeons mice gradually
increased, eventually stabilizing ∼55 34%, respectively, sixth
generation. intergenerational differences host preferences significant
(p < 0.001). furthermore, differences host preferences mosquitoes
selected prefer pigeons selected prefer mice both
significant consistent almost six generations.
