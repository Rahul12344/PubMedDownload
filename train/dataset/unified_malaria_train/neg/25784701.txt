transmission malaria occurs anopheles mosquito vector blood meals, when
plasmodium sporozoites invaded mosquito salivary glands are
delivered mammalian host. sporozoites display unique form motility
that essential movement across cellular host barriers invasion
of hepatocytes. molecular machinery powering motility invasion is
increasingly well defined, signaling events control essential
parasite activities clearly delineated. here, identify a
phosphodiesterase (pdeγ) plasmodium, regulator signaling cyclic
nucleotide second messengers. reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) analysis and
epitope tagging endogenous pdeγ detected expression blood stages and
sporozoites plasmodium yoelii. deletion pdeγ (pdeγ(-)) rendered sporozoites
nonmotile, failed invade mosquito salivary glands. consequently, 
pdeγ deletion completely blocked parasite transmission mosquito bite.
strikingly, pdeγ(-) sporozoites showed dramatically elevated levels cyclic gmp
(cgmp), indicating perturbation cyclic nucleotide balance involved
in observed phenotypic defects. transcriptome sequencing (rna-seq) analysis
of pdeγ(-) sporozoites revealed reduced transcript abundance genes encode
key components motility invasion apparatus. data reveal crucial 
role pdeγ maintaining cyclic nucleotide balance malaria

maintaining cyclic nucleotide balance, deletion blocks transmission of
sporozoites. deeper understanding signaling mechanisms involved in
transmission might inform discovery novel drugs interrupt this
essential step parasite life cycle.
