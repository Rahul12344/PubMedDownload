flavobacteria (members family flavobacteriaceae) dominate bacterial
community anopheles mosquito midgut. one commensal, elizabethkingia
anophelis, closely associated anopheles mosquitoes transstadial
persistence (i.e., one life stage next); properties
favor development paratransgenic applications control malaria
parasite transmission. however, physiological requirements e. anophelis
have investigated, capacity perpetuate despite digestion 
pressure gut quantified. end, first developed techniques
for genetic manipulation e. anophelis, including selectable markers, reporter 
systems (green fluorescent protein [gfp] nanoluc), transposons that
function e. anophelis. flavobacterial expression system based the
promoter pompa integrated e. anophelis chromosome showed strong 
promoter activity drive gfp nanoluc reporter production. introduced,
gfp-tagged e. anophelis associated mosquitoes successive developmental
stages propagated anopheles gambiae anopheles stephensi in
aedes triseriatus mosquitoes. feeding nanoluc-tagged cells a. gambiae a.
stephensi larval stage led infection rates 71% 82%,
respectively. contrast, low infection rate (3%) detected aedes
triseriatus mosquitoes conditions. initial e. anophelis
cells provided larvae, 23%, 71%, 85% digested a. stephensi, a.
gambiae, aedes triseriatus, respectively, demonstrating e. anophelis
adapted various mosquito midgut environments differently. bacterial cell
growth increased 3-fold arginine supplemented defined
medium. furthermore, number nanoluc-tagged cells a. stephensi
significantly increased arginine added sugar diet, showing be
an important amino acid e. anophelis. animal erythrocytes promoted e.
anophelis growth vivo vitro, indicating bacterium could
obtain nutrients participating erythrocyte lysis mosquito midgut.
