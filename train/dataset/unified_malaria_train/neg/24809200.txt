dna dried blood spots 39 vivax malaria patients (2009-2010) anhui
(bengbu urban district counties wuhe, huaiyuan, mengcheng lixin) was
extracted. plasmodium vivax ldh (pvldh) gene amplified, cloned and
sequenced. sequences subjected ncbi blast program. results showed
that targeted dna fragment size 951 bp without difference among 39
samples (accession no. gu078391), 99% homologous pvldh
sequences strains genbank. one different amino acid 
in protein sequences isolates anhui ejeu60134 or
mia061251 strains.
