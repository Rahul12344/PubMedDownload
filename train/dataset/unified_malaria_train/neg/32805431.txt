intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(iptp-sp) one main strategies protecting pregnant women, fetus, and
their new-born adverse effects p. falciparum infection. the
development drug resistance linked mutations p. falciparum
dihydrofolate reductase gene (pfdhfr) p. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase 
gene (pfdhps), currently threatening iptp-sp approach. study
determined prevalence pfdhfr pfdhps mutations isolates obtained
from pregnant women asymptomatic p. falciparum infection nigerian.
additionally, p. falciparum genetic diversity multiplicity infection (moi)
was assessed genotyping p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 2
(pfmsp-1 pfmsp-2) genes. pfdhfr pfdhps genotyped direct
sequencing, pfmsp-1 pfmsp-2 fragment analysis polymerase chain
reaction used determine p. falciparum genetic diversity. 406
pregnant women recruited, 123 p. falciparum infection pcr, these,
52 successfully genotyped pfdhfr 42 pfdhps genes. pfdhfr
triple-mutant parasites (n51i, c59r, s108n) irn haplotype were
predominant (98%), whereas pfdhfr mutations c50r i164l occur. for
pfdhps gene, prevalence a437g, a581g, a436a, a613s mutations 98, 
71, 55, 36%, respectively. nineteen (44%) isolates quintuple mutations
(cirni- sgkga) highest combined pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotype. isolates with
sextuple mutants; cirni- agkas cirni- agkga prevalence 29 14%,
respectively. high genetic diversity (7 pfmsp-1 alleles 10 pfmsp-2 alleles)
and monoclonal infection rate (76%) observed. study demonstrated a
continuous high prevalence pfdhfr mutation increase pfdhps mutations
associated sp-resistance southwest nigeria. continuous surveillance of
iptp-sp effectiveness consideration alternative iptp strategies is
recommended.
