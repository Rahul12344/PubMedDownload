previous whole genome comparisons plasmodium falciparum populations not
included collections indian subcontinent, even though two million
indians contract malaria 50,000 die disease every year.
stratification global parasites revealed spatial relatedness parasite
genotypes different continents. here, genomic analysis improved to
obtain country-level resolution removing var genes intergenic regions from
distance calculations. p. falciparum genomes india found most
closely related other. nearest neighbors bangladesh and
myanmar, followed thailand. samples rest southeast asia, africa
and south america increasingly distant, demonstrating high-resolution
genomic-geographic continuum. genome stratification approaches help
monitor variations malaria parasites within south asia future changes in
parasite populations may arise in-country cross-border migrations.
