artemisinins widely used treat plasmodium infections due high
clinical efficacy; however, antimalarial mechanism artemisinin remains
unresolved. mutations p. falciparum atpase6 (pfatp6), sarcoplasmic
endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-transporting atpase, associated increased
tolerance artemisinin. utilized saccharomyces cerevisiae model to
examine involvement pmr1p, functional homolog pfatp6, toxicity
of artemisinin. analysis demonstrated cells lacking pmr1p less
susceptible growth inhibition artemisinin derivatives. no
association sensitivity artemisinin altered trafficking the
drug efflux pump pdr5p, calcium homeostasis, protein glycosylation found
in pmr1∆ yeast. basal ros levels elevated pmr1∆ yeast artemisinin
exposure enhance ros accumulation. contrast wt cells 
exhibit significant increase ros production following treatment with
artemisinin. yeast deleted pmr1 known accumulate excess manganese ions
that function ros-scavenging molecules, correlation between
manganese content artemisinin resistance observed. propose loss
of function mutations pmr1p yeast cells pfatp6 p. falciparum are
protective artemisinin toxicity due reduced intracellular oxidative
damage.
