recent reports highlight severity morbidity disease caused 
long neglected malaria parasite plasmodium vivax. due inherent difficulties in
the laboratory-propagation p. vivax, biology parasite been
adequately explored. proteome p. falciparum, causative agent 
cerebral malaria, extensively explored several sources, is
limited information proteome p. vivax. have, first time,
examined proteome p. vivax isolated directly patients without
adaptation laboratory conditions. identified 153 proteins from
clinical p. vivax, majority show homology previously known
gene products. also report 29 new proteins found expressed 
p. vivax first time. addition, several proteins previously implicated 
as anti-malarial targets, also found analysis. importantly, we
found several unique proteins expressed p. vivax.this study important
step providing insight physiology parasite clinical
settings.
