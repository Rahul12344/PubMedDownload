we describe technology imaging sequestration infected red blood
cells (irbc) rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei bodies
of live mice dissected organs, using transgenic parasite expresses 
luciferase. real-time imaging sequestered irbc performed measuring
bioluminescence produced enzymatic reaction parasites the
luciferase enzyme substrate luciferin injected mice several
minutes prior imaging. bioluminescence signal detected sensitive
i-ccd photon-counting video camera. using reporter parasite expresses
luciferase control schizont-specific promoter (i.e., ama-1
promoter), schizont stage made visible detecting bioluminescence
signals. schizont sequestration imaged short-term infections with
parasites synchronized development ongoing infections.
real-time vivo imaging irbc provide increased insights the
dynamics sequestration role pathology, used evaluate 
strategies prevent sequestration.
