tetrorchidium didymostemon widely used traditional medicine practitioners
to manage treat several diseases. despite known ethnomedicinal uses,
there scientific studies toxic effects plant. study
was performed evaluate potential toxicity methanol extracts
tetrorchidium didymostemon leaves sub-acute oral administration rats. 
twenty four (24) male albino rats (wistar strain) average weight 150 ± 20 g
were randomly divided 4 groups 6 rats each. group 1 control while
groups 2, 3 4 administered 100, 300 600 mg/kg body weight the
plant extracts respectively 14 consecutively days. extract induce
any treatment related changes body weight, organ/body weight ratio,
biochemical parameters (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, total
protein, albumin, creatinine urea), oxidative stress indices
(malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase reduced glutathione) and
histopathology (liver kidney) treated groups compared the
control. however, 600 mg/kg body weight dose, extract caused significant
(p < 0.05) decrease hemoglobin level, packed cell volume expression of
albumin gene rats. similarly, 300 600 mg/kg body weight, extract
also caused non-significant (p > 0.05) decrease red blood cell count.
furthermore, extract 100 300 mg/kg body weight induced significant
(p < 0.05) increase expression tumor necrosis factor - alpha kidney
injury molecule - 1 (kim-1) genes. catalase gene expression especially the
kidney up-regulated groups administered extract. study
suggests oral administration t. didymostemon leaves extract relatively
safe. however, need caution due observed changes in
hematological profile, up-regulation kim-1 genes well regulation of
albumin gene.
