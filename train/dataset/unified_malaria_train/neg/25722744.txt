background: intra-erythrocytic development, late asexually replicating
plasmodium falciparum parasites sequester peripheral circulation. this
facilitates chronic infection linked severe disease organ-specific 
pathology including cerebral placental malaria. immature gametocytes - sexual
stage precursor cells - likewise disappear circulation. recent work has
demonstrated sexual stage parasites located hematopoietic
system bone marrow mature gametocytes released the
bloodstream facilitate mosquito transmission. however, sequestration occurs
only vivo vitro culture, mechanisms is
regulated enacted (particularly gametocyte stage) remain poorly
understood.
results: generated comprehensive p. falciparum functional gene
network date integrating global transcriptional data large set of
asexual sexual vitro samples, patient-derived vivo samples, new
set vitro samples profiling sexual commitment. defined 250
functional modules (clusters) genes co-expressed primarily the
intra-erythrocytic parasite cycle, including 35 sexual commitment and
gametocyte development. comparing vivo vitro datasets allowed us,
for first time, map time point asexual parasite sequestration in
patients 22 hours post-invasion, confirming previous vitro observations 
the dynamics host cell modification cytoadherence. moreover, able 
to define properties gametocyte sequestration, demonstrating presence 
of two circulating gametocyte populations: gametocyte rings 0 and
approximately 30 hours post-invasion mature gametocytes around 7 days
post-invasion.
conclusions: study provides bioinformatics resource functional
elucidation parasite life cycle dynamics specifically demonstrates the
presence gametocyte ring stages circulation, adding significantly to
our understanding dynamics gametocyte sequestration vivo.
