plasma antimalarial antibody mediate anti-parasite immunity not
previously characterized molecular level. here, develop an
innovative strategy characterize humoral responses integrating profiles 
plasma immunoglobulins (ig) antibodies expressed b cells part
of bcr. applied strategy define plasma ig determine variable v
gene usage vaccination plasmodium falciparum zygote antigen pfs25.
first, using proteomic tools coupled bulk immunosequencing data, we
determined human f(ab')2 peptide sequences plasma ig adults received 
four doses pfs25-epa/alhydrogel. specifically, pfs25 antigen-specific f(ab')2 
peptides (pfs25-ig) aligned cdna sequences igh complementarity
determining region 3 (cdr3) dataset generated total peripheral b cell
immunosequencing entire vaccinated population. ighv4 commonly
identified ighv subgroup pfs25-ig, pattern corroborated vh/vl
sequencing pfs25-specific single b cells five vaccinees matching
plasma pfs25-ig peptides v-(d)-j sequences pfs25-specific single b cells
from donor. among 13 recombinant human mabs generated ig sequences 
of pfs25-specific single b cells, single ighv4 mab displayed strong
neutralizing activity, reducing number p. falciparum oocysts infected
mosquitoes 80% 100 μg/ml. approach characterizes human
plasma antibody repertoire response pfs25-epa/alhydrogel vaccine and
will useful study circulating antibodies response vaccines as
well induced infections autoimmune disorders.
