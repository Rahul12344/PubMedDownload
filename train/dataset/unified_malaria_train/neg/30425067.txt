in sub-saharan africa, inherited causes anemia common, data are
limited regarding geographical prevalence coinheritance these
conditions overall contributions childhood anemia. address 
questions malawi, performed secondary analysis 2015-2016 malawi
micronutrient survey, nationally regionally representative survey that
estimated prevalence micronutrient deficiencies evaluated both
inherited noninherited determinants anemia. children age 6 59 months
were sampled 105 clusters within 2015-2016 malawi demographic health
survey. hemoglobin, ferritin, retinol binding protein, malaria, inflammatory 
biomarkers measured venous blood. molecular studies performed
using dried blood spots determine presence sickle cell disease or
trait, α-thalassemia trait, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency. 1279 eligible children, 1071 included final analysis. 
anemia, iron deficiency, malaria common, affecting 30.9%, 21.5%, and
27.8% participating children, respectively. α-thalassemia trait common
(>40% children demonstrating deletion 1 [33.1%] 2 [10.0%] α-globin
genes) associated higher prevalence anemia (p < .001). approximately 
20% males g6pd deficiency, associated 1.0 g/dl protection
in hemoglobin decline malaria infection (p = .02). data document
that inherited blood disorders common likely play important role in
the prevalence anemia malaria malawian children.
