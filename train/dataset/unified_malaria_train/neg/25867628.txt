a renewed global commitment malaria elimination lends urgency understanding
the biology plasmodium transmission stages. recent progress toward uncovering 
the mechanisms underlying plasmodium falciparum sexual differentiation and
maturation reveals potential targets transmission-blocking drugs and
vaccines. identification parasite factors alter sexual
differentiation, including extracellular vesicles master transcriptional
regulator, suggest parasites make epigenetically controlled developmental
decisions based environmental cues. new insights sexual development,
especially host cell remodeling sequestration bone marrow, highlight
open questions regarding parasite homing tissue, transmigration across the
vascular endothelium, maturation parenchyma. novel molecular and
translational tools provide opportunities define host-parasite
interactions design effective transmission-blocking therapeutics.
