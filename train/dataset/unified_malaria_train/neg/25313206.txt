malaria patients frequently coinfected hiv mycobacteria causing
tuberculosis, increases use coadministered drugs thereby
enhances risk pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. activation the
pregnane x receptor (pxr) xenobiotics, include many drugs, induces drug 
metabolism transport, thereby resulting possible attenuation loss of
the therapeutic responses drugs coadministered. several
artemisinin-type antimalarial drugs shown activate pxr, data on
nonartemisinin-type antimalarials still missing. therefore, study aimed 
to elucidate potential nonartemisinin antimalarial drugs drug
metabolites activate pxr. screened 16 clinically used antimalarial drugs
and six major drug metabolites binding pxr using two-hybrid pxr ligand
binding domain assembly assay; identified carboxymefloquine, major and
pharmacologically inactive metabolite antimalarial drug mefloquine, a
potential pxr ligand. two-hybrid pxr-coactivator -corepressor interaction
assays pxr-dependent promoter reporter gene assays confirmed
carboxymefloquine novel pxr agonist specifically activated the
human receptor. pxr-expressing intestinal ls174t cells primary
human hepatocytes, carboxymefloquine induced expression drug-metabolizing 
enzymes transporters mrna protein levels. crucial role pxr 
for carboxymefloquine-dependent induction gene expression confirmed by
small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated knockdown receptor. thus, the
clinical use mefloquine may result pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions
by means metabolite carboxymefloquine. whether vitro findings are
of vivo relevance addressed future clinical drug-drug interaction
studies.
