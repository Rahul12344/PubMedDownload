within liver single plasmodium parasite transforms thousands of
blood-infective forms cause malaria. here, use rna-sequencing identify
host genes upregulated upon plasmodium berghei infection hepatocytes 
with hypothesis host pathways hijacked benefit parasite
development. found expression aquaporin-3 (aqp3), water glycerol
channel, significantly induced plasmodium-infected hepatocytes compared 
uninfected cells. aquaglyceroporin localizes parasitophorous vacuole 
membrane, compartmental interface host pathogen, a
temporal pattern correlates parasite's expansion liver.
depletion elimination host aqp3 expression significantly reduces p. berghei
parasite burden liver stage chemical disruption known aqp3
inhibitor, auphen, reduces p. falciparum asexual blood stage p. berghei liver
stage parasite load. use inhibitor chemical probe suggests
that aqp3-mediated nutrient transport important function parasite
development. study reveals previously unknown potential route for
host-dependent nutrient acquisition plasmodium discovered mapping
the transcriptional changes occur hepatocytes throughout p. berghei
infection. dataset reported may leveraged identify additional host
factors essential plasmodium liver stage infection highlights
plasmodium's dependence host factors within hepatocytes.
