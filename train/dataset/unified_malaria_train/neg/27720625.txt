high density oligonucleotide microarrays used plasmodium vivax field
isolates estimate whole genome expression. however, microarray platform has
been experimentally optimized studying transcriptome field isolates.
in present study, adopted bioinformatics experimental testing
approaches select best optimized probes suitable detecting parasite
transcripts field samples included designing custom 15k p.
vivax microarray. microarray long oligonucleotide probes (60mer) that
were in-situ synthesized onto glass slides using agilent sureprint technology and
has developed 8x15k format (8 identical arrays single slide).
probes array experimentally validated represents 4180 p. vivax
genes sense orientation, 1219 genes also probes antisense
orientation. validation 15k array using field samples (n=14) shown 
99% parasite transcript detection samples. correlation
analysis duplicate probes (n=85) present arrays showed perfect
correlation (r2=0.98) indicating reproducibility. multiple probes
representing gene exhibited similar kind expression pattern across
the samples (positive correlation, r≥0.6). comparison hybridization data 
the previous studies quantitative real-time pcr experiments performed to
highlight microarray validation procedure. array unique its
design, results indicate array sensitive reproducible. hence,
this microarray could valuable functional genomics tool generate reliable
expression data p. vivax field isolates.
