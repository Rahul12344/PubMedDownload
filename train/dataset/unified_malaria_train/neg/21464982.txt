background: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) used animal 
model human multiple sclerosis (ms), inflammatory demyelinating
autoimmune disease central nervous system characterized activation of
th1 and/or th17 cells. human autoimmune diseases either exacerbated or
suppressed infectious agents. recent studies shown regulatory t
cells play crucial role escape mechanism plasmodium spp. in
humans experimental models. cells suppress th1 response 
the parasite prevent elimination. regulatory cells largely
associated protection amelioration several autoimmune diseases, mainly
by capacity suppress proinflammatory response.
methodology/principal findings: study, verified cd4(+)cd25(+)
regulatory cells (t regs) generated malaria infection (6 days eae 
induction) interfere evolution eae. observed positive
correlation reduction eae clinical symptoms increase of
parasitemia levels. suppression disease also accompanied decrease
in expression il-17 ifn-γ increases expression il-10 and
tgf-β1 relative eae control mice. adoptive transfer cd4(+)cd25(+) cells
from p. chabaudi-infected mice reduced clinical evolution eae, confirming 
the role regs.
conclusions/significance: data corroborate previous findings showing that
infections interfere prevalence evolution autoimmune diseases 
inducing regulatory cells, regulate eae apparently non-specific
manner.
