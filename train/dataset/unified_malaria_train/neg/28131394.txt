the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum presents antigens infected

(csa) crucial step pathophysiology placental malaria csa
binding region var2csa identified promising vaccine target
against placental malaria. designed adenovirus encoded virus-like
particles (vlp) co-encoding simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) gag and
var2csa. var2csa antigen fused transmembrane (tm) cytoplasmic 
tail (ct) domains either envelope protein mouse mammary tumour virus
(mmtv) hemagglutinin (ha) influenza a. non-vlp incorporation
control, third design made var2csa expressed without tm-ct
domains. primary immunogenicity study balb/c mice, var2csa fused ha 
tm-ct significantly superior inducing id1-id2a specific antibodies after
the first immunization. sequential study performed include comparison 
to soluble var2csa protein vaccine, entered phase clinical
trial (nct02647489). results revealed induction higher antibody
responses increased inhibition parasite binding csa using either
var2csa ha tm-ct var2csa mmtv tm-ct priming vaccines protein
double-boost immunizations, compared protein prime-double boost regimen.
analysis pooled serum samples peptide arrays revealed unique targeting of
several epitopes mice primed var2csa ha tm-ct.
consequently, modification vlp anchors important point optimization
in virus-encoded retroviral vlp-based vaccines, adenovirus vlps boosted by
recombinant proteins offer hope increasing levels protective var2csa
specific antibodies.
