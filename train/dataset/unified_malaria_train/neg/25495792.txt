background: erythrocyte invasion merozoites essential step plasmodium
falciparum infection leads subsequent disease pathology. proteins 
the merozoite surface secreted apical organelles (micronemes,
rhoptries dense granules) mediate invasion erythrocytes; the
molecules regarded targets development anti-malaria
vaccine. recently, subgroup rhoptry neck proteins (pfron2, pfron4 and
pfron5) associated microneme protein apical membrane antigen ama1 has
been described components moving junction complex assists
merozoite invasion erythrocytes. however, unlike pfron2, pfron4 pfron5, 
the latest study suggested pfron3 might located rhoptry bulb and
participates novel pfron complex (pfron2, 3 4), form a
complex ama1. additionally, full-length pfron3 protein possesses three
transmembrane regions n-terminus, highly conserved among ron3
orthologues genus plasmodium, toxoplasma gondii eimeria tenella.
overall, findings suggest pfron3 may play important role in
merozoite invasion erythrocytes.
results: pfron3 primarily expressed late trophozoite stage, a
peak transcription levels 40Â hours post-invasion. subcellular
localization pfron3 confirmed merozoite rhoptry bulb protein.
additionally, recombinant form pfron3 protein bound erythrocyte and
was recognized sera collected malaria endemic areas africa, and
anti-pfron3 antibodies significantly inhibited merozoite invasion into
erythrocytes.
methods: expression pfron3 analysed via real-time quantitative pcr,
and recombinant pfron3 proteins generated escherichia coli
expression system. subcellular localization pfron3 assessed with
immunoelectron microscopy immunofluorescence assay (ifa). recognition
pfron3 malaria immune sera analysed enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa). erythrocyte-binding assays performed using recombinant pfron3
proteins invasion inhibition assays carried pfron3-specific
antibodies.
conclusion: study confirmed pfron3 rhoptry protein an
erythrocyte-binding property, likely associated red blood cell invasion.
pfron3 potential vaccine candidate.
