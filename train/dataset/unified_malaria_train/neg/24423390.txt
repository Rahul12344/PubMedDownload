background: decline efficacy artesunate (as) mefloquine (mq) now
the major concern areas along thai-cambodian thai-myanmar borders.
methods: correlation polymorphisms pfatp6, pfcrt, pfmdr1 and
pfmrp1 genes vitro sensitivity plasmodium falciparum isolates the
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) components mq, including the
previously used first-line anti-malarial drugs chloroquine (cq) quinine (qn) 
were investigated total 119 p. falciparum isolates collected from
patients uncomplicated p. falciparum infection 2006-2009.
results: reduced vitro parasite sensitivity [median (95% ci) ic50 3.4
(3.1-3.7) nm] found 42% isolates, whereas resistance mq [median 
(95% ci) ic50 54.1 (46.8-61.4) nm] accounted 58% isolates.

respectively; qn ic50: 183.0 (139.9-226.4), 256.4 (83.7-249.1), 329.5

conclusion: high prevalence cq mq-resistant p. falciparum isolates was
observed four-year observation period (2006-2009). sensitivity 
declined, qn sensitivity improved. pfmdr1 pfmrp1 appear the
key genes modulate multidrug resistance p. falciparum.
