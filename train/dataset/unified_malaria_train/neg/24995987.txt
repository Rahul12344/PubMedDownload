the availability diverse genomes makes possible predict gene function
based shared evolutionary history. approach challenging, however, 
for pathways whose components exhibit shared history rather consist 
of distinct "evolutionary modules." introduce computational algorithm,
clustering inferred models evolution (clime), inputs eukaryotic
species tree, homology matrix, pathway (gene set) interest. clime
partitions gene set disjoint evolutionary modules, simultaneously
learning number modules tree-based evolutionary history defines
each module. clime expands module scanning genome new
components likely arose inferred evolutionary model. application
of clime ∼1,000 annotated human pathways proteomes yeast, red
algae, malaria reveals unanticipated evolutionary modularity coevolving
components. clime freely available become increasingly powerful
with growing wealth eukaryotic genomes.
