olfactory information drives several behaviours critical survival and
persistence insect pests vectors. insect behaviour variable, linked 
their biological needs, regulated physiological dynamics. mosquitoes, 
co2 important cue signifies presence host, elicits 
activation attraction. investigate genetic basis olfactory
modulation mosquitoes, assayed changes co2 detection receptor gene 
expression physiological function behaviour, associated onset
of host seeking malaria vector, anopheles gambiae. gene encoding a
subunit co2 receptor, aggr22, found significantly up-regulated
in host-seeking females, consistent significant increase sensitivity of
co2-responsive neurons (cpa) housed capitate peg sensilla maxillary
