widespread resistance pyrethroids threatens malaria control africa.
consequently, several countries switched carbamates organophophates
insecticides indoor residual spraying. however, mutation ace-1 gene 
conferring resistance compounds (ace-1(r) allele), already present.
furthermore, duplicated allele (ace-1(d)) recently appeared; characterizing its
selective advantage mandatory evaluate threat. data revealed a
unique duplication event, pairing susceptible resistant copy ace-1
gene spread west africa. investigations revealed that, while
ace-1(d) confers less resistance ace-1(r), high fitness cost associated 
with ace-1(r) almost completely suppressed duplication traits
studied. ace-1 duplication thus represents permanent heterozygote phenotype,
selected, thus spreading, due mosaic nature mosquito control. it
provides malaria mosquito new evolutionary path could hamper
resistance management.
