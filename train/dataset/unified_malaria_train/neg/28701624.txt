aminopeptidase n (apn) member highly conserved m1 family of
metalloproteases, considered valuable target treatment 
a variety diseases, e.g., cancer, malaria, coccidiosis. study, 
identified apn gene (tgapn2) toxoplasma gondii genome, performed 
biochemical characterization recombinant tgapn2 (rtgapn2) protein. active 
rtgapn2 first produced purified escherichia coli. catalytic
activity enzyme verified using specific fluorescent substrate,
h-ala-mca; rtgapn2 relatively active absence added metal ions. 
the addition metal ions, especially zn2+, inhibited activity the
recombinant enzyme. activity rtgapn2 reduced presence the
edta chelator absence added metal ions. optimum ph enzyme
activity 8.0; enzyme active 3-10 ph range. substrate
preference rtgapn2 evaluated. enzyme showed preference for
substrates containing n-terminal ala arg residues. finally, bestatin and
amastatin shown inhibit activity enzyme. conclusion,
rtgapn2 shared general characteristics m1 family aminopeptidases 
also unique characteristics. provides basis function of
aminopeptidases study drug targets.
