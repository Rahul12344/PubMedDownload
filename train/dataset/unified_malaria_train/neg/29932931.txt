currently, national malaria control programme (nmcp) sierra leone
recommends artesunate-amodiaquine (asaq) artemether-lumefantrine (al) as
first- second-line treatment uncomplicated malaria, respectively, and
artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) intermittent preventive treatment
during pregnancy infants. 2016, nmcp conducted study assess
the clinical parasitological responses children five years asaq, 
al dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dha/ppq) according protocol.
day-0 samples tested mutations kelch 13 gene (pfk13) and
dihydrofolate reductase/dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhfr/pfdhps) genes associated
with artemisinin sp resistance, respectively, amplification the
pfplasmepsin2 gene piperaquine resistance. total 295 (asaq = 128,
al = 64 dha/ppq = 103) eligible children enrolled three sites.
pcr-corrected 100% adequate clinical parasitological response no
parasitaemia day-3 observed patients treatment group. 
the 278 samples interpretable molecular data, 2.2% carried
non-synonymous pfk13 mutants (a578s, i646t), associated with
artemisinin resistance. none 103 day-0 samples dah/ppq group 
pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification, confirming absence piperaquine
resistance. prevalence triple pfdhfr mutant (n51i/c59r/s108n) was
close reached fixation (97.4-100%). combined pfdhfr/pfdhps mutation,
55-71% carried quadruple (n51i/c59r/s108n+a437g) mutant 10% the
quintuple mutant n51i/c59r/s108n+a437g/k540e. findings confirm asaq, al 
and dha/ppq highly effective treatment uncomplicated malaria in
the study areas, neither pfk13 validated mutations pfplasmepsin2 multiple
copies found. low prevalence quintuple mutant study 
supports nmcp's decision introduce intermittent preventive treatment for
infants sp districts high malaria transmission.
