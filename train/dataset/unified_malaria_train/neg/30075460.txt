background: november 2015, reuse needles syringes conjunction with
an increase cases hcv clinic korea reported investigated by
public health authorities. patients received injections clinic from
the first time infection control breach may occurred 2008 through
2015 practice stopped offered screening hcv other
blood-borne pathogens hiv, htlv, hbv, syphilis, malaria.
objectives: aim study assess whether outbreak hepatitis 
c occurred among potentially exposed clinic patients due this
infection control breach.
study design: performed hepatitis c viral rna load tests genotyping using 
plasma hepatitis c antibody-positive individuals visited clinic 
between may 2008 november 2015. analyzed core-e2 ns5b regions of
the virus rna-positive samples constructing phylogenetic tree based 
maximum likelihood analysis. identify transmission risk factors and
epidemiological relationships among patients, reviewed medical
records, assessed staff infection control practices performed environmental
inspection clinic. environmental samples medication room surfaces and
medication vial contents tested hcv rna.
results conclusions: among 1721 patients tested, 96 igg-positive and
70 viral rna-positive. among 61 patients whose viral loads greater 
than detection limit, 41 (67.2%) classified genotype 1a, 1 (1.6%) 
genotype 1b, 18 (29.5%) genotype 1, one (1.6%) genotype 2. after
sequencing, 12 genotype 1 cases classified genotype 1a (11) 1b
(1). sequences core-e2 ns5b regions 45 patients formed a
monophyletic cluster distinct genotype 1a. hepatitis c virus sequences
from patients environmental specimens well-matched partial e1
gene region. detected genotype 1a rna environmental specimens, indicating a
healthcare-associated outbreak caused reuse syringes contaminated
multi-dose vials. molecular epidemiological investigation hepatitis c
genotype 1a, rare korea, aid investigations infection sources during
future pathogen outbreaks.
