background: plasmodium causal parasite malaria, infectious disease
responsible death one million people year.
glycerophospholipid consequently membrane biosynthesis essential 
survival parasite targeted new class antimalarial drugs
developed lab. order understand highly redundant phospholipid
synthethic pathways eventual mechanism resistance various drugs, an
organism specific kinetic model metabolic pathways need developed 
in plasmodium species.
results: fluxomic data used build quantitative kinetic model of
glycerophospholipid pathways plasmodium knowlesi. vitro incorporation
dynamics phospholipids unravels multiple synthetic pathways. detailed
metabolic network values kinetic parameters (maximum rates and
michaelis constants) built. order obtain global search the
parameter space, designed hybrid, discrete continuous, optimization
method. discrete parameters used sample cone admissible fluxes,
whereas continuous michaelis maximum rates constants obtained by
local minimization objective function.the model used predict the
distribution fluxes within network various metabolic precursors.the
quantitative analysis used understand eventual links different
pathways. major source phosphatidylcholine (pc) cdp-choline kennedy
pathway.in silico knock-out experiments showed comparable importance of
phosphoethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (pmt) and
phosphatidylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (pemt) pc synthesis.the flux
values indicate that, major part serine derived phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) 
is formed via serine decarboxylation, whereas major part phosphatidylserine
(ps) formed base-exchange reactions.sensitivity analysis cdp-choline
pathway shows carrier-mediated choline entry parasite the
phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction largest sensitivity
coefficients pathway, distinguish reaction unique
rate-limiting step.
conclusion: provide fully parametrized kinetic model multiple
phospholipid synthetic pathways p. knowlesi. model used to
clarify relative importance various reactions metabolic
pathways. future work extensions modelling strategy serve to
elucidate regulatory mechanisms governing development plasmodium
during blood stages, well mechanisms action drugs membrane
biosynthetic pathways eventual mechanisms resistance.
