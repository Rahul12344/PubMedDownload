antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum regulated transcriptional
switches among members var gene family, expressed mutually
exclusive manner encoding different variant surface antigens
collectively named pfemp1. antigenic switching starts first merozoites
egress liver begin asexual proliferation within red blood
cells. erasing epigenetic memory created parasites var
background, similar merozoites egress liver var gene is
expressed. creating null-var background enabled us investigate onset 
antigenic switches early phase infection. onset switching,
var transcription pattern heterogeneous numerous genes transcribed low
levels including upsa vars, subtype implicated severe malaria,
which rarely activated growing cultures. analysis subsequent vitro
switches shows probability gene turn associated
with chromosomal position promoter type per se intrinsic properties
of gene. concluded var switching determined gene specific
associated switch rates rather general promoter type locus associated
switch rates. addition, show fine tuned reduction var transcription
increases switch rate, indicating transcriptional perturbation can
alter antigenic switching.
