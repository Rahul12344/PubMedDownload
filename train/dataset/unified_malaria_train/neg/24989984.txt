background: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), antifolate, replaced by
artemether-lumefantrine first-line malaria drug treatment kenya 2004
due wide spread resistance. however, sp still remains recommended
drug intermittent preventive treatment pregnant women infants (iptp/i)
owing safety profile. study assessed prevalence mutations in
dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes
associated sp resistance samples collected kenya 2008 and
2012.
methods: field isolates collected kisumu, kisii, kericho malindi
district hospitals assessed genetic polymorphism various loci within 
pfdhfr pfdhps genes sequencing.
results: among pfdhfr mutations, codons n51i, c59r, s108n showed highest
prevalence field sites 95.5%, 84.1% 98.6% respectively. pfdhfr 
s108n prevalence highest kisii 100%. temporal trend analysis showed
steady prevalence mutations time except codon pfdhps 581 showed
an increase mixed genotypes. triple pfdhfr n51i/c59r/s108n double pfdhps
a437g/ k540e high prevalence rates 86.6% 87.9% respectively. the
pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple, n51i/c59r/s108n/a437g/k540e mutant shown 
to clinically relevant marker sp resistance observed 75.7%
of samples.
conclusion: sp resistance still persistently high western kenya, is
likely due fixation key mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes well as
drug pressure antifolate drugs used treatment malaria
and infections. addition, emergence increasing prevalence
of new mutations kenyan parasite population. since sp used iptp/i,
molecular surveillance vitro susceptibility assays must sustained to
provide information emergence spread sp resistance.
