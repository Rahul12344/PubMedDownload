whether vaccination virus protect virulent coinfection
with virus additional pathogen(s) remains poorly characterized.
overlapping endemicity human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) malaria suggests
that hiv/malaria coinfection frequently complicates acute chronic hiv
infection. showed vaccination macaques recombinant listeria 
δacta prfa* expressing simian/human immunodeficiency virus (shiv) gag env
elicited gag- env-specific t-cell responses, protected against
life-threatening shiv-related malaria shiv/plasmodium fragile coinfection. 
shiv antigen immunization reduced peak viremia, resisted shiv/malaria-induced
lymphoid destruction, blunted coinfection-accelerated decline cd4(+)
t-cell counts shiv/malaria coinfection. shiv antigen immunization also
weakened coinfection-driven overreactive proinflammatory interferon-γ (ifnγ)
responses led developing helper cell 17/22 (th17/th22) responses after
shiv/malaria coinfection. findings suggest vaccination aids
