background: study aimed gain first data prevalence g6pd enzyme
deficiency measured spectrophotometry associated genetic variants jimma
and surroundings, ethiopia. area plasmodium vivax endemic region, but
8-aminoquinolines primaquine recommended g6pd testing not
available.
methods: healthy volunteers recruited jimma university, ethiopia. enzyme 
activity tested spectrophotometry university ulm, germany. a
g6pd rdt (binax now® g6pd, alere, usa) additionally performed. g6pd gene 
was analysed polymorphisms sub-population. tests haemoglobinopathies
and presence malaria parasites conducted.
results: severe moderate (cut-off 60%) g6pd deficiency found 206
volunteers. median male activity 6.1 u/g hb. eleven participants (5.4%)
showed activities 70 80%. haemoglobinopathy detected. none 
the subjects showed asymptomatic parasitaemia. one g6pd-a+ variant (a376g) and
one new non-synonymous mutation (g445a) found.
conclusions: prevalence g6pd deficiency seems low area, use
of 8-aminoquinolines encouraged. however, reliable g6pd testing methods
have implemented safe cut-off levels need defined.
