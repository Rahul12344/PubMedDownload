malaria third prevalent cause global mortality an
interesting case evolutionary selection. response high frequency of
malaria infection, several host genetic factors selected, as
hemoglobin variants, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency and
pyruvate kinase deficiency. among popular host genetic factors, deficiency 
of pyruvate kinase enzyme one important factor provide
resistance malaria. regulation enzyme level of
transcription important several factors may play crucial role in
regulation enzyme. dna sequence variation epigenetic factors
modifying transcriptional regulation gene explored context of
several diseases. present study, explored factors modifying
transcription regulation pyruvate kinase gene help bioinformatics 
tools. basis predictions hypothesize factor that
reduces availability (level) activity pyruvate kinase enzyme must play 
a strong role resistance malaria. thus, factors reducing activity (loss
of function) level pyruvate kinase selected provide resistance
against malaria primarily endemic regions.
