this article focuses novel vaccine strategy known vector-mediated
antibody gene transfer, particular focus human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv). strategy provides solution problem current vaccines 
fail generate neutralizing antibodies prevent hiv-1 infection aids.
antibody gene transfer allows predetermination antibody affinity and
specificity prior "immunization" avoids need active humoral
immune response hiv envelope protein. approach uses recombinant 
adeno-associated viral (raav) vectors, shown transduce muscle 
with high efficiency direct long-term expression variety of
transgenes, deliver gene encoding broadly neutralizing antibody the
muscle. following raav vector gene delivery, broadly neutralizing antibodies 
are endogenously synthesized myofibers passively distributed the
circulatory system. improvement classical passive immunization
strategies administer antibody proteins host provide protection
from infection. vector-mediated gene transfer studies mice monkeys with
anti-hiv simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)-neutralizing antibodies
demonstrated long-lasting neutralizing activity serum complete protection
against intravenous challenge virulent hiv siv. results indicate
that existing potent anti-hiv antibodies rapidly moved clinic.
however, methodology need confined hiv. general strategy of
vector-mediated antibody gene transfer applied difficult vaccine 
targets hepatitis c virus, malaria, respiratory syncytial virus, and
tuberculosis.
