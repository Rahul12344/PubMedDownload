background: role vectors transmission avian malaria parasites is
currently understudied. many studies investigate parasite-vector
relationships use limited trapping techniques and/or identify potential competent
vectors field ways cannot distinguish infected 
infectious vector. without use multiple trapping techniques address
the specific biology diverse mosquito species, without looking the
infection status individual mosquitoes, possible make dependable 
conclusions role mosquitoes transmission avian malaria
parasites.
methods: conducted two years mosquito collections riparian preserve in
california wide diversity species collected multiple trap
types. hypothesized competent mosquito species influence the
distribution diversity avian malaria parasites acting a
compatibility filter specific plasmodium species. determine infection 
status individual mosquitoes plasmodium species/lineages,
amplification within cytochrome b gene carried 3000
individual mosquito thoraxes, tested positive repeated
the process abdomens salivary glands.
results: data show heterogeneity transmissibility plasmodium among 
ornithophillic mosquito species. specifically, culex stigmatosoma appears to
not vector plasmodium homopolare, parasite prevalent the
avian population, vector multiple plasmodium species/lineages.
conclusions: results suggest conclusions made role vectors
from studies use different mosquito trapping methods be
re-evaluated caution, documented potential trapping biases,
which may cause studies miss important roles specific mosquito species in
the transmission avian malaria. moreover, document heterogeneity the
transmission plasmodium spp. mosquitoes influence plasmodium diversity 
and prevalence specific locations plasmodium-vector incompatibilities.
