the innate immune response highly conserved across eukaryotes been
studied great detail several model organisms. hemocytes, primary immune
cell population mosquitoes, important components mosquito innate
immune response, yet critical aspects biology remained
uncharacterized. using novel method enrichment, isolated phagocytic
granulocytes quantified proteomes mass spectrometry. data
demonstrate phagocytosis, blood-feeding, plasmodium falciparum infection
promote dramatic shifts proteomic profiles an. gambiae granulocyte
populations. interest, large numbers immune proteins induced in
response blood feeding alone, suggesting granulocytes integral
role priming mosquito immune system pathogen challenge. addition,
we identify several granulocyte proteins putative roles membrane
receptors, cell signaling, immune components silenced, either
positive negative effects malaria parasite survival. integrating existing
hemocyte transcriptional profiles, also compare differences hemocyte
transcript protein expression provide new insight hemocyte gene
regulation discuss potential post-transcriptional regulation may 
an important component hemocyte gene expression. data represent a
significant advancement mosquito hemocyte biology, providing first
comprehensive proteomic profiling mosquito phagocytic granulocytes during
homeostasis blood-feeding, pathogen challenge. together, findings
extend current knowledge illustrate importance hemocytes in
shaping mosquito innate immunity principal role defining malaria
parasite survival mosquito host.
