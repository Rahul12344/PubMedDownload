vector control key component fight malaria decades,
and chemical insecticides critical success vector control programs 
worldwide. however, increasing resistance insecticides threatens undermine 
these efforts. understanding evolution propagation resistance thus 
imperative mitigating loss intervention effectiveness. additionally,
accelerated research development new tools deployed alongside 
existing vector control strategies key eradicating malaria near
future. methods gene drives aim genetically modify large mosquito
populations wild either render refractory malaria impair
their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. mathematical models gene flow
in populations, transfer genetic information one population 
to another migration, offer invaluable insight behavior 
potential impact gene drives well spread insecticide resistance
