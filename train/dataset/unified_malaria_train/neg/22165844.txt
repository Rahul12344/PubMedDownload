background: despite extensive efforts discover transcription factors their
binding sites human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, few
transcription factor binding motifs experimentally validated date.
as consequence, gene regulation p. falciparum still poorly understood.
there evidence chromatin architecture plays important role 
transcriptional control malaria.
results: propose methodology discovering cis-regulatory elements that
uses first time exclusively dynamic chromatin remodeling data. method
employs nucleosome positioning data collected seven time points the
erythrocytic cycle p. falciparum discover putative dna binding motifs and
their transcription factor binding sites along associated clusters 
target genes. approach results 129 putative binding motifs within the
promoter region known genes. 75% novel, remaining being
highly similar experimentally validated binding motifs. half the
binding motifs reported show statistically significant enrichment functional
gene sets strong positional bias promoter region.
conclusion: experimental results establish principle dynamic chromatin
remodeling data used lieu gene expression data discover binding
motifs transcription factor binding sites. approach applied 
using dynamic nucleosome positioning data, independent knowledge of
gene function expression.
