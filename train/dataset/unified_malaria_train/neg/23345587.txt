var2csa, member plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(pfemp1) family, leading candidate use vaccines protect first-time
mothers placental malaria (pm). var2csa, comprised series of
six duffy binding-like (dbl) domains, binds chondroitin sulfate (csa) on
placental syncytiotrophoblast. several recombinant dbl domains shown to
bind csa. order identify develop recombinant proteins suitable for
clinical development, dbl2x dbl3x, well respective third
subdomain (s3) fcr3 parasite clone, expressed escherichia coli, 
refolded, purified. dbl3x-s3 recombinant proteins bound csa
expressed chinese hamster ovary (cho)-k1 cells cho-pgsa745 cells,
which csa negative determined flow cytometry. dbl3x-s3 bound to
csa chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (cspg) determined surface plasmon
resonance (spr) analysis. purified igg rats rabbits immunized these
four recombinant proteins bound homologous heterologous
parasite-infected erythrocytes (ie). using novel flow cytometry
inhibition-of-binding assay (flow-iba), antibodies dbl3x-s3 inhibited 35%
and 45% ie binding csa cho-k1 cells compared results soluble csa 
(scsa) purified multigravida (mg) igg, respectively, areas tanzania
to malaria endemic. antibodies generated domains
provided little inhibition ie binding csa cho-k1 cells as
determined flow cytometry inhibition-of-binding assay. results
demonstrate first time ability identify antibodies var2csa dbl 
domains subdomains capable inhibiting var2csa parasite-ie binding csa
by flow cytometry. flow cytometry inhibition-of-binding assay robust 
provided accurate, reproducible, reliable means identify blocking ie
binding csa promises significant development vaccine
