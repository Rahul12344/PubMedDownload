plasmodium vivax increasingly dominant species malaria greater
mekong subregion (gms), pursuing regional malaria elimination. p. vivax 
lineages gms poorly characterized. currently, p. vivax reference
genomes scarce due difficulties culturing parasite lack of
high-quality samples. addition, p. vivax incredibly diverse, necessitating 
the procurement reference genomes different geographical regions. we
present four new p. vivax draft genomes assembled de novo clinical samples
collected china-myanmar border area. demonstrate comparable length 
content existing genomes, majority structural variation occurring 
around subtelomeric regions exported proteins, corroborated with
detection copy number variations regions. predicted peptides 
all pir gene subfamilies, except pir d. confirmed proteins
classically labeled pir family members identifiable pir motifs,
and actually bear stronger resemblance duf (domain unknown function) family
duf3671, potentially pointing new, closely related gene family. further,
phylogenetic analyses msp7 genes showed high variability within msp7-b
family compared msp7-a -c families, result comparable 
from whole genome analyses. new genome assemblies serve resource for
studying p. vivax within gms.
