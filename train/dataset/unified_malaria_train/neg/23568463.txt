resistance drugs treat infectious disease major problem worldwide.
the rapid emergence drug resistance well understood. present two 
silico models discovery drug resistance mechanisms combating
the evolution resistance, respectively. first model, computationally
investigated subgraphs biological interaction network show substantial 
adaptations cells transcriptionally respond changing environment or
treatment. case study, investigated response malaria parasite 
plasmodium falciparum chloroquine tetracycline treatments. second
model involves machine learning technique combines clustering, common
distance similarity measurements, hierarchical clustering propose new
combinations drug targets.
