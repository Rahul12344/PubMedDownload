chemical cues considered important cues mosquitoes find
their hosts humans ranked attractiveness mosquitoes based on
the chemical cues emit. human leukocyte antigen (hla) genes considered
to involved regulation human body odor may therefore affect
human attractiveness mosquitoes, hence, affect force malaria
transmission. present study correlations hla profiles, human
skin volatiles human attractiveness malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae
giles sensu stricto examined. skin emanations 48 volunteers were
collected rubbing foot glass beads. previously attractiveness of
these emanations an. gambiae determined. study, chemical
composition emanations determined gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy (gc-ms) blood samples volunteers taken hla
analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis (hca), partial least squares discriminant
analysis (pls-da), fisher's exact test random forest regression used 
test correlations individuals classified either highly poorly
attractive mosquitoes hla profile volatile composition. hla
profiling suggests people carrying hla gene cw∗07 attractive to
mosquitoes. gc-ms revealed limonene, 2-phenylethanol 2-ethyl-1-hexanol
were associated individuals poorly attractive an.gambiae and
lactic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid octanal with
individuals highly attractive. compounds offer potential for
disruption mosquito behavior malaria intervention programs.
