background: gut microbes contribute hosts food digestion,
nutrient absorption, inhibiting growth pathogens. however, only
limited studies focused gut microbiota freshwater snails. pomacea 
canaliculata considered one worst invasive alien species world. 
elucidating diversity composition microbiota gut p.
canaliculata snails may helpful better understanding widespread
invasion snail species. study, buccal masses, stomachs, and
intestines isolated seven p. canaliculata snails. diversity and
composition microbiota three gut sections investigated
based high-throughput illumina sequencing targeting v3-v4 regions the
16s rrna gene.
results: diversity microbiota highest intestine lowest 
in buccal mass. total 29 phyla 111 genera bacteria were
identified samples. general, ochrobactrum, genus putative
cellulose-degrading bacteria, abundant (overall relative abundance: 
13.6%), followed sediminibacterium (9.7%), desulfovibrio (7.8%), an
unclassified genus family aeromonadaceae (5.4%), cloacibacterium
(5.4%). composition microbiota diverse among different gut
sections. ochrobactrum (relative abundance: 23.15% ± 7.92%) sediminibacterium
(16.95 ± 5.70%) abundant stomach, unclassified genus the
family porphyromonadaceae (14.28 ± 7.29%) leptotrichia (8.70 ± 4.46%) were
highest buccal mass, two genera families aeromonadaceae
(7.55 ± 4.53%) mollicutes (13.47 ± 13.03%) highest intestine.
conclusions: diversity composition microbiome vary among different
gut sections p. canaliculata snails. putative cellulose-degrading bacteria are
enriched gut p. canaliculata.
