background: key gene sets involved progression acute liver failure 
(alf), high mortality rate, remain unclear. study aims gain a
deeper understanding transcriptional response peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) following alf.
methods: alf induced d-galactosamine (d-gal) porcine model. pbmcs
were separated time zero (baseline group), 36 h (failure group), 60 h
(dying group) d-gal injection. transcriptional profiling performed
using rna sequencing analysed using david bioinformatics resources.
results: compared baseline group, 816 1,845 differentially expressed
genes (degs) identified failure dying groups, respectively. a
total five two gene ontology (go) term clusters enriched 107 go
terms failure group 154 go terms dying group. go clusters
were primarily immune-related, including genes regulating inflammasome
complex toll-like receptor signalling pathways. specifically, go terms
related cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, 
related fibrosis, coagulation dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy were
enriched. seven kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes (kegg) pathways,
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, lysosome,
rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, phagosome pertussis pathways mapped
for degs failure group. seven kegg pathways involved 
the 19 kegg pathways mapped dying group.
conclusion: found dramatic pbmc transcriptome changes triggered by
alf progression predominantly related immune responses. enriched go
terms related cell death, fibrosis, on, indicated pbmc
transcriptome analysis, seem useful elucidating potential key gene sets 
in progression alf. better understanding gene sets might 
preventive therapeutic interest.
