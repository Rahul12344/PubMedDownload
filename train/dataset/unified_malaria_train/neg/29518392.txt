plasmodium falciparum causative agent malaria complex life
cycle human mosquito hosts. translation repression specific set mrna
has reported gametocyte stages parasite. conserved element
present 3'utr transcripts identified. biochemical
studies identified components rna storage and/or translation
inhibitor complex yet clear complex specifically
recruited rna targeted translation regulation. used 3'utr
region translationally regulated transcripts identify phosphatidyl-inositol
5-phosphate 4-kinase (pip4k2a) protein associates rnas. we
further show recombinant pip4k2a rna binding activity can
associate specifically plasmodium 3'utr rnas. immunostainings show that
hpip4k2a imported plasmodium parasite rbc. results
identify novel rna binding role pip4k2a may play role plasmodium 
propagation.
