we tested five distinct classes established experimental antimalarial
drugs anticancer potential, using panel 91 human cancer lines.
three classes drugs: artemisinins, synthetic peroxides dhfr (dihydrofolate
reductase) inhibitors effected potent inhibition proliferation ic50s in
the nm- low Âµm range, whereas dhodh (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) a
putative kinase inhibitor displayed activity. furthermore, significant
synergies identified erlotinib, imatinib, cisplatin, dasatinib and
vincristine. cluster analysis antimalarials based differential
inhibition various cancer lines clearly segregated synthetic peroxides
oz277 oz439 artemisinin cluster included artesunate,
dihydroartemisinin artemisone, dhfr inhibitors pyrimethamine and
p218 (a parasite dhfr inhibitor), emphasizing shared mode action. in
order understand basis selectivity compounds
against different cancers, microarray-based gene expression data 85 the
used cell lines generated. compound, distinct sets genes were
identified whose expression significantly correlated compound sensitivity.
several antimalarials tested study well-established and
excellent safety profiles plasma exposure, conservatively used in
malaria, well ic50s identified study. given
their unique mode action potential unique synergies established
anticancer drugs, results provide strong basis explore the
potential application compounds cancer pre-clinical and
clinical settings.
