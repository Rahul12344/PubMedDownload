background: cellular metabolism generates reactive oxygen species. oxidation 
and deamination deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dntp) pool results the
formation non-canonical, toxic dntps cause mutations, genome
instability, cell death. house-cleaning sanitation enzymes break down
and detoxify non-canonical nucleotides play major protective roles nucleotide 
metabolism constitute key drug targets cancer various pathogens. we
hypothesized owing protective roles nucleotide metabolism, these
house-cleaning enzymes key drug targets malaria parasite.
methods: using rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei evaluate here,
by gene targeting, group conserved proteins putative function 
detoxification non-canonical nucleotides potential antimalarial drug
targets: inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (itpase), deoxyuridine
triphosphate pyrophosphatase (dutpase) two nudix hydroxylases, the
diadenosine tetraphosphate (ap4a) hydrolase nucleoside triphosphate
hydrolase (ndh).
results: four proteins expressed constitutively across the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, neither itpase ndh required for
parasite viability. dutpase ap4ah null mutants, hand, not
viable suggesting essential function proteins malaria
parasite.
conclusions: plasmodium dutpase ap4a could drug targets malaria
parasite.
