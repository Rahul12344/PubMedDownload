parasite antigen genetic diversity represents great obstacle designing a
vaccine malaria caused plasmodium vivax. selecting vaccine candidate
antigens focused fulfilling role invasion are
conserved, thus avoiding specific-allele immune responses. antigens
described date belong blood stage, thereby blocking parasite
development within red blood cells, whilst studying antigens stages
has quite restricted. antigens different parasite stages required
for developing completely effective vaccine; thus, pre-erythrocyte stage
antigens able block first line infection becoming established should
also taken account. however, antigens stage been
studied date. several p. falciparum sporozoite antigens involved in
invasion. since 77% genes orthologous amongst plasmodium parasites, p.
vivax sporozoite antigen orthologs p. falciparum might present 
its genome. although genes might high genetic diversity, conserved
functionally-relevant regions (ideal vaccine development) could predicted 
by comparing genetic diversity patterns evolutionary rates. study was
thus aimed searching putative p. vivax sporozoite genes analyse
their genetic diversity determining potential vaccine candidates.
several dna sequence polymorphism estimators computed locus. the
evolutionary force (drift, selection recombination) drawing genetic
diversity pattern observed also determined using tests based on
polymorphism frequency spectrum well type intra- inter-species
substitutions. likewise, recombination assessed indirectly directly.
the results showed sporozoite genes conserved merozoite genes
evaluated date. putative domains implied cell traversal, gliding motility
and hepatocyte interaction negative selection signal, conserved
amongst different species genus. pvp52, pvp36, pvspatr, pvplp1, pvmcp1,
pvtlp, pvceltos, pvmb2 antigens functionally restricted regions within
them would thus seem promising vaccine candidates could used when
designing pre-erythrocyte and/or multi-stage vaccine p. vivax avoid 
allele-specific immune responses could reduce vaccine efficacy.
