the saliva hematophagous arthropods injected blood feeding contains
potent pharmacologically active components counteract host hemostatic 
inflammatory systems. present study, dominant salivary gland transcripts
of panstrongylus chinai, vector chagas disease, analyzed sequencing 
randomly selected clones salivary gland cdna library. analysis showed
that 56.5% isolated transcripts coded putative secreted proteins, of
which 73.7% coded proteins belonging lipocalin family. most
abundant transcript lipocalin family proteins homologue pallidipin 2,
an inhibitor collagen-induced platelet aggregation triatoma pallidipennis. 
in addition, homologues triafestin, inhibitor kallikrein-kinin
system t. infestans, identified dominant transcript. other
salivary transcripts encoding lipocalin family proteins homology triplatin
(an inhibitor platelet aggregation) others unknown function. other
than lipocalin family proteins, homologues kazal-type serine protease
inhibitor (putative anticoagulant), hemolysin-like protein (unknown function), 
inositol polyphosphate 5-related protein (a regulator membrane
phosphoinositide), antigen 5-related protein (unknown function) apyrase
(platelet aggregation inhibitor) identified.
