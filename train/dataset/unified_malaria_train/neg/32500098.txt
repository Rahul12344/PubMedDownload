the rodent parasite plasmodium chabaudi important vivo model malaria.
the ability produce chronic infections makes particularly useful for
investigating development anti- plasmodium immunity, well features
associated parasite virulence acute chronic phases of
infection. p. chabaudi also undergoes asexual maturation (schizogony) and
erythrocyte invasion culture, offers experimentally-amenable vivo 
in vitro model studying gene function drug activity parasite
replication. extend usefulness model, optimised
transfection protocols plasmids p. chabaudi generated stable,
fluorescent lines free drug-selectable marker genes. these
mother-lines show infection dynamics wild-type parasites throughout
the lifecycle mice mosquitoes; furthermore, virulence be
increased serial blood passage reset mosquito transmission. have
also adapted large-insert, linear plasmogem vectors revolutionised 
the scale experimental genetics another rodent malaria parasite used
these generate barcoded p. chabaudi gene-deletion -tagging vectors for
transfection fluorescent p. chabaudi mother-lines. produces a
