background: malaria remains global public health problem responsible for
445,000 deaths 2016. microscopy remains mainstay malaria
diagnosis, highly sensitive molecular methods detection low-grade
sub-microscopic infections needed surveillance studies identifying
asymptomatic reservoirs malaria transmission.
methods: plasmodium falciparum genome sequence analysed identify high 
copy number genes improve p. falciparum parasite detection blood by
rt-pcr. plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1)-specific
primers evaluated p. falciparum detection hospital-based
microscopically positive dried blood spots field-acquired whole blood from
asymptomatic individuals ghana.
results: pfemp1 outperformed pf18s sequence amplification-based p.
falciparum detection. pfemp1 primers exhibited sevenfold higher sensitivity
compared pf18s primers parasite genomic dna. probit analysis established a
95% detection threshold 9.3 parasites/ml pfemp1 compared to
98.2 parasites/ml pf18s primers. pfemp1 primers also demonstrated
superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 100% (20/20) dried blood spot
samples 70% (69/98) asymptomatic individuals positive versus 55%
(11/20) 54% (53/98), respectively, pf18s amplification.
conclusions: results establish pfemp1 novel amplification target for
highly sensitive detection acute infections filter paper samples and
submicroscopic asymptomatic low-grade infections.
