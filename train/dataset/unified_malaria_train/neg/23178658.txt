malaria parasites like aerobes need detoxify reactive oxygen species
(ros) mainly produced hemoglobin degradation food vacuole.
since plasmodium lacks catalase genuine glutathione peroxidase, are
highly dependent peroxiredoxins (prxs) superoxide dismutases ros
detoxification. prxs protective antioxidant enzymes act through
reduction hydrogen peroxides. recent years, several studies done 
on prx family human malaria parasites mainly plasmodium falciparum 
much human malaria species. study 1-cys peroxiredoxin
(1-cys-prx) plasmodium vivax plasmodium knowlesi cloned and
characterized. complete genes coding 1-cys-prx p. vivax (pv1-cys-prx) 
and p. knowlesi (pk1-cys-prx) pcr amplified recombinant proteins
were produced heterologous over-expression escherichia coli. both
recombinant proteins showed antioxidant activity mixed function
oxidation assay. using specific polyclonal antibodies, indicated that
pv1-cys-prx pk1-cys-prx expressed cytoplasm parasite.
altogether, results suggested 1-cys-prxs protect parasites from
oxidative damages.
