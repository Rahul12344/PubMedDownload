the malarial protein celtos, cell-traversal protein ookinetes and
sporozoites, plasmodium berghei shown mediate malarial invasion 
of vertebrate insect host cells required establishing their
successful infections. vertebrate host, plasmodium sporozoites traverse
via complex passage cellular barriers skin liver
sinusoid infect hepatocytes. induction immunity targeted molecules
involved sporozoite motility migration hepatocytes may lead to
abrogation hepatocyte infection. previously demonstrated potential
of celtos target antigen pre-erythrocytic vaccine. objective of
the current study determine potency different vaccine platforms 
induce protective immunity determine mode action protective immune 
responses. end, inbred balb/c outbred icr mice immunized with
either recombinant protein adjuvanted montanide isa-720 a
pci-tpa plasmid encoding p. berghei celtos (epidermal delivery gene-gun)
and assessed induction protective responses homologous p.
berghei challenge. humoral cellular immune responses induced various
immunization regimens evaluated effort establish immune correlates.
the results confirm celtos antigen potentially interesting
pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate demonstrate arms adaptive
immune system required mediate complete sterile protection against
sporozoite challenge.
