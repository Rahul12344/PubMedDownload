most human malaria deaths caused blood-stage plasmodium falciparum
parasites. cerebral malaria, life-threatening complication the
disease, characterised accumulation plasmodium falciparum infected
red blood cells (irbc) pigmented trophozoite stage microvasculature 
the brain(2-4). microvessel obstruction (sequestration) leads acidosis,
hypoxia harmful inflammatory cytokines (reviewed (5)). sequestration is
also found microvascular tissues human body(2, 3). mechanism
by irbc attach blood vessel walls still poorly understood. the
immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (hbec-5i) been
used vitro model blood-brain barrier(6). however, plasmodium
falciparum irbc attach poorly hbec-5i vitro, unlike dense
sequestration occurs cerebral malaria cases. therefore developed a
panning assay select (enrich) various p. falciparum strains adhesion to
hbec-5i order obtain populations high-binding parasites, more
representative occurs vivo. sample parasite culture (mixture of
irbc uninfected rbc) pigmented trophozoite stage washed and
incubated layer hbec-5i grown petri dish. incubation, dish
is gently washed free urbc unbound irbc. fresh urbc added few
irbc attached hbec-5i incubated overnight. schizont stage parasites
burst, merozoites reinvade rbc ring stage parasites harvested the
following day. parasites cultured enough material obtained
(typically 2 4 weeks) new round selection performed. depending
on p. falciparum strain, 4 7 rounds selection needed order to
get population parasites bind hbec-5i. binding phenotype is
progressively lost weeks, indicating switch variant surface
antigen gene expression, thus regular selection hbec-5i required to
maintain phenotype. summary, developed selection assay rendering p.
falciparum parasites "cerebral malaria adhesive" phenotype. able
to select 3 4 p. falciparum strains hbec-5i. assay also
successfully used select parasites binding human dermal and
pulmonary endothelial cells. importantly, method used select
tissue-specific parasite populations order identify candidate parasite
ligands binding brain endothelium. moreover, assay used to
screen putative anti-sequestration drugs(7).
