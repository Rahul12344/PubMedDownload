a number studies analyzed performance malaria rapid diagnostic
tests (rdts) colombia discrepancies performance attributed 
combination factors parasite levels, interpretation rdt results
and/or handling storage rdt kits. however, inconsistencies
observed results plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2
(pfhrp2)-based rdts could also explained deletion gene that
encodes protein, pfhrp2, structural homolog, pfhrp3, parasite
isolates. given pfhrp2- pfhrp3-negative p. falciparum isolates been
detected neighboring peruvian brazilian amazon regions, we
hypothesized parasites deletions pfhrp2 pfhrp3 may also be
present colombia. study tested 100 historical samples collected
between 1999 2009 six departments colombia presence of
pfhrp2, pfhrp3 flanking genes. seven neutral microsatellites also 
used determine genetic background parasites. total 18 100
parasite isolates found deleted pfhrp2, majority (14 of
18) collected amazonas department, borders peru brazil.
pfhrp3 deletions found 52 100 samples collected regions
of country. pfhrp2 flanking genes pf3d7_0831900 pf3d7_0831700 were
deleted 22 100 1 100 samples, respectively. pfhrp3 flanking genes
pf3d7_1372100 pf3d7_1372400 missing 55 100 57 100
samples. structure analysis microsatellite data indicated colombian
samples tested study belonged four clusters segregated mostly
based geographic region. pfhrp2-deleted parasites were
assigned single cluster originated amazonas department although a
few pfhrp2-negative parasites originated three clusters. the
presence high proportion pfhrp2-negative isolates colombian amazon
may implications use pfhrp2-based rdts region may
explain inconsistencies observed pfhrp2-based tests assays are
performed.
