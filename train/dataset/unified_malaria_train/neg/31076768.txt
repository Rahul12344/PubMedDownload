artemisinin, frontline drug malaria, sesquiterpenoid extracted
from artemisia annua. light proposed play important role the
activation artemisinin biosynthesis. here, report basic leucine zipper 
transcription factor (tf) aahy5 key regulator light-induced biosynthesis 
of artemisinin. show aahy5 transcription overlaps of
artemisinin biosynthesis genes response light a. annua tissues.
analysis aahy5 overexpression rnai-suppression lines suggests aahy5
is positive regulator expression artemisinin biosynthesis genes and
accumulation artemisinin. show aahy5 complements hy5 mutant in
arabidopsis thaliana. data suggest aahy5 interacts aacop1, 
the ubiquitin e3 ligase constitutive photomorphogenic1 a. annua. yeast
one-hybrid transient expression assays, demonstrate aahy5 acts via
the tf glandular trichome-specific wrky 1 (aagsw1) artemisinin regulation. 
summary, present novel regulator artemisinin gene expression propose 
a model aahy5 indirectly controls artemisinin production response 
changing light conditions.
