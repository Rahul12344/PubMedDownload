antigenic variation human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum involves 
sequential mutually exclusive expression members var multi-gene
family appears follow non-random pattern. study, using a
detailed vitro gene transcription analysis culture-adapted hb3 strain
of p. falciparum, show antigenic switching governed global
activation hierarchy favouring short highly diverse genes central
chromosomal location. longer conserved genes, previously been
associated severe infection immunologically naive hosts, rarely
activated, however, implying vivo fitness advantage possibly through
adhesion-dependent survival rates. show gene's activation rate 
is positively associated sequence diversity, could offer important new
insights evolution maintenance antigenic diversity p.
