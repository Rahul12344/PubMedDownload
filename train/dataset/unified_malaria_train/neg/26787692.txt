parthenin parthenolide natural products closely related in
structure artemisinin, also sesquiterpene lactone (sql) one 
the important antimalarial drugs available. parthenin, like artemisinin, has
an effect onplasmodiumblood stage development. extended evaluation of
parthenin potential therapeutic transmissible stages ofplasmodium
falciparumas transitions human mosquito, aim gaining
potential mechanistic insight inhibitory activity compound. we
posited parthenin targets different biological pathways parasite, 
this turn could pave way development druggable compounds that
could prevent spread artemisinin-resistant parasites. examined
parthenin's effect male gamete activation ookinete-to-oocyst
transition mosquito well stage v gametocytes present 
peripheral blood. parthenin arrested parasite development stages 
tested. broad inhibitory properties parthenin evaluated parasite
stages may suggest different mechanisms action parthenin and
artemisinin. parthenin's cytotoxicity notwithstanding, demonstrated activity 
in study suggests structurally related sqls better safety
profile deserve exploration. used battery assays test
parthenolide, compelling safety profile. parthenolide
demonstrated activity nearly identical parthenin againstp. falciparum,
highlighting potential possible transmission-blocking drug scaffold. 
discuss context evidence respect next steps toward
expanding current antimalarial arsenal.
