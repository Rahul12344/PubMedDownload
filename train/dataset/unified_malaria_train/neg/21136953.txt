malaria causes worldwide annual mortality million people. rapidly
evolving drug-resistant species parasite created pressing need 
the identification new drug targets vaccine candidates. developing
fractionation protocols enrich parasites low-parasitemia patient samples,
we carried first ever proteomics analysis clinical isolates of
early stages plasmodium falciparum (pf) p. vivax. patient-derived malarial
parasites directly processed analyzed using shotgun proteomics approach 
using high-sensitivity ms protein identification. study revealed about
100 parasite-coded gene products included many known drug targets pf
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, pf l-lactate dehydrogenase, 
plasmepsins. addition, study reports expression several parasite
proteins clinical ring stages never reported ring stages
of laboratory-cultivated parasite strain. proof-of-principle study
represents noteworthy step forward understanding pathways elaborated 
by parasite within malaria patient pave way towards
identification new drug vaccine targets aid malaria therapy.
