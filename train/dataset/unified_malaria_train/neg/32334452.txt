objective: investigate cytotoxic activity ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate (epmc)
including effect p-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance-1: mdr-1 gene) in
human cholangiocarcinoma cell.
methods: cytotoxic activity epmc human cholangiocarcinoma (cl-6),
fibroblast (oums-36t-1f), colon cancer (caco-2) cell lines assessed
using mtt assay. selectivity index (si) determined ratio ic50
(concentration inhibits cell growth 50%) epmc oums-36t-1f 
in cl-6 cell. cell cycle arrest apoptosis cl-6 cells investigated 
flow cytometry fluorescent microscopy. effect epmc mdr-1 gene
expression cl-6 caco-2 determined real-time pcr.
results: median (95% ci) ic50 values epmc cl-6, oums-36t-1f, caco-2
were 245.5 (243.1-266.7), 899.60 (855.8-966.3) 347.0 (340.3-356.9) Âµg/ml,
respectively. si value compound cl-6 cell 3.70. epmc at
ic50 inhibited cl-6 cell division induced apoptosis compared untreated
control. epmc exposure induce mdr-1 gene expression cl-6 and
caco-2 cells.
conclusion: results suggest potential role epmc cholangiocarcinoma 
with low possibility drug resistance induction.
