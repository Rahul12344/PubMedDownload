malaria major public health problem north-east india mainly transmitted
by anopheles baimai an. minimus anopheles nivipes plays important
supportive role. genetic diversity an. nivipes north-east india was
investigated employing two mitochondrial dna markers namely nadh dehydrogenase
5 (nd5) cytochrome oxidase sub unit ii (coii). high genetic diversity an. 
nivipes observed detection 16 haplotypes among 30 sequences nd5 
gene 29 haplotypes among 29 coii sequences. anopheles nivipes north-east
india significantly differentiated genetically neighboring
south-east asian an. nivipes revealed pairwise fst values 0.127
(p < 0.01) 0.044 (p < 0.001) nd5 coii genes, respectively, suggesting
geographical barriers gene flow species two geographical
areas resulting significant population structuring.
