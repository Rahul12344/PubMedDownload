genetic modifiers anemia plasmodium falciparum infection sickle cell
disease (scd) fully known. conditions associated oxidative 
stress, hemolysis anemia. cyb5r3 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase 3, 
which converts methemoglobin hemoglobin oxidation nadh.
cyb5r3c.350c > g encoding cyb5r3t117s , frequent recognized
african-specific polymorphism, known functional significance, but
its high allele frequency (23% african americans) suggests selection
advantage. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) essential protection
from oxidants; african-polymorphic x-linked a+ a- alleles, other
variants reduced activity, coincide endemic malaria distribution,
suggesting protection lethal infection. examined association of
cyb5r3c.350c > g severe anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dl) context g6pd
a+ a- status among 165 zambian children malaria. cyb5r3c.350c > g
offered protection severe malarial anemia children without g6pd
deficiency (g6pd wild type a+/a- heterozygotes) (odds ratio 0.29, p = .022)
but g6pd a+ a- hemizygotes/homozygotes. also examined the
relationship cyb5r3c.350c > g hemoglobin concentration among 267 children
and 321 adults adolescents scd us uk found higher
hemoglobin scd patients without g6pd deficiency (β = 0.29, p = .022 children; 
β = 0.33, p = .004 adults). functional studies scd erythrocytes revealed
mildly lower activity native cyb5r3t117s compared wildtype cyb5r3 and
higher nadh/nad+ ratios. conclusion, cyb5r3c.350c > g appears ameliorate
anemia severity malaria scd patients without g6pd deficiency, possibly
accounting cyb5r3c.350c > g selection high prevalence.
