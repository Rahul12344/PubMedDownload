interaction antimalarial drugs important determining outcome of
chemotherapy using drug combinations. inhibitors dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) pyrimethamine dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) sulfa
drugs known synergistic interactions. however, studies the
synergism complicated fact malaria parasite also salvage 
exogenous folates, salvage may also affected drugs. is
desirable convenient system study interaction dhfr dhps
inhibitors without complications. here, describe use escherichia
coli transformed malarial dhfr dhps, corresponding genes
have inactivated optimal concentration trimethoprim genetic
knockout, respectively, study interaction inhibitors. marked
synergistic effects observed combinations pyrimethamine sulfa 
inhibitors presence trimethoprim. 0.05μm trimethoprim, sum of
fractional inhibitory concentrations, σfic pyrimethamine sulfadoxine,
pyrimethamine sulfathiazole, pyrimethamine sulfamethoxazole, and
pyrimethamine dapsone range 0.24-0.41. results show
synergism inhibitors two enzymes even absence folate
transport uptake. bacterial surrogate system useful tool 
for assessing interactions drug combinations dhfr dhps
inhibitors.
