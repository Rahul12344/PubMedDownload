the present study determined compared genetic diversity plasmodium
falciparum strains infecting children living 2 areas gabon different
malaria endemicity. blood samples collected febrile children 2008 
to 2009 2 health centres rural (oyem) urban (owendo) areas. genetic
diversity determined p. falciparum isolates analyzing merozoite
surface protein-1 (msp1) gene polymorphism using nested-pcr. overall, 168
children mild falciparum malaria included. k1, ro33, mad20 alleles 
were found 110 (65.5%), 94 (55.9%), 35 (20.8%) isolates, respectively,
without difference according site (p>0.05). allelic families' frequencies 
were comparable children less 5 years old 2 sites; while
among older children proportions ro33 mad20 alleles 1.7 to
2.0 fold higher oyem. thirty-three different alleles detected, 16 (48.5%)
were common sites, 10 17 specific alleles found at
oyem. furthermore, multiple infection carriers frequent oyem (57.7% vs
42.2% owendo; p=0.04) complexity infection 1.88 (±0.95)
higher compared found owendo (1.55±0.75). extended genetic diversity
of p. falciparum strains infecting gabonese symptomatic children high
multiplicity infections observed rural area. alleles common 2
sites frequent; site-specific alleles predominated rural area.
such distribution alleles taken accounts designing
msp1 msp2 malaria vaccine.
