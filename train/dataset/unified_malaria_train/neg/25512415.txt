chloroquine-primaquine (cq-pq) continues frontline therapy radical 
cure plasmodium vivax malaria. emergence cq-resistant (cqr) p. vivax
parasites requires shift artemisinin combination therapies (acts), which
imposes significant financial, logistical, safety burden. monitoring the
therapeutic efficacy cq thus important. here, evaluated therapeutic 
efficacy cq-pq p. vivax malaria northeast myanmar. recruited 587
patients p. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics 2012 
to 2013. patients received three daily doses cq total dose 24 mg
of base/kg body weight 8-day pq treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing 
at time first cq dose. 401 patients finished the
28-day follow-up, cumulative incidence recurrent parasitemia 5.20%
(95% confidence interval [ci], 3.04% 7.36%). among 361 (61%) patients
finishing 42-day follow-up, cumulative incidence recurrent blood-stage
infection reached 7.98% (95% ci, 5.20% 10.76%). cumulative risk of
gametocyte carriage days 28 42 2.21% (95% ci, 0.78% 3.64%) and
3.93% (95% ci, 1.94% 5.92%), respectively. interestingly, 15 patients 
with recurrent gametocytemia, associated concurrent asexual stages.
genotyping recurrent parasites merozoite surface protein 3α gene locus 
from 12 patients recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed 10 of
these genotype day 0, suggesting recrudescence relapse.
similar studies 70 patients area 2007 showed recurrent
parasitemias within 28 days. sensitivity chloroquine p. vivax in
northeastern myanmar may deteriorating.
