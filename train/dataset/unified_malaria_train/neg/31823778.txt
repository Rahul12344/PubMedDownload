background: malaria infection present wide variety symptoms,
ranging mild severe. plasmodium falciparum isolates uncomplicated 
severe malaria infections may different parasite genetic profiles. this
study conducted assess differences genetic diversity allelic
frequencies p. falciparum isolates according malaria severity age of
patients gublack area, northwest ethiopia.
methods: cross-sectional health facility-based study conducted gublak,
ethiopia july, 2017 october, 2017. symptomatic p. falciparum malaria 
patients microscopically-confirmed infection enrolled. parasite dna was
extracted filter paper blood spots polymorphic regions msp-1 
and msp-2 genes genotyped using allele-specific nested-pcr fragment
analysis gel electrophoresis.
results: total 118 patients enrolled including 95 (80.5%) with
uncomplicated infection 23 (19.5%) severe disease. msp-1, k1
allelic family similarly prevalent uncomplicated 42 (44.2%) severe
disease 12 (52.2%). msp-2, fc27 detected 55 (57.9%) uncomplicated
infections ic/3d7 14 (60.9%) severe infections. 76 (64.4%) 118
isolates contained multiple genotypes; 56 (58.9%) uncomplicated infections and
19 (82.6%) severe infections. overall multiplicity infection 2.2
(95% ci 1.98-2.42) 1.4 (95% ci 1.23-1.55) 1.7 (95% ci 1.49-1.86) for
msp-1 msp-2, respectively. multiplicity infection significantly higher
in severe uncomplicated infections (3.0 (95% ci 2.61-3.47) versus 2.0 (95%
ci 1.83-2.23), respectively, p = 0.001). difference multiplicity 
of infection across age groups (p = 0.104).
conclusion: patients severe malaria likely multiclonal
infections. studies needed describe association p.
falciparum genotypes malaria severity different malaria transmission
areas.
