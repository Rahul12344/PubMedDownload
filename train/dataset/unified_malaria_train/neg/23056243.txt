in genome-wide screen alpha-helical coiled coil motifs aiming at
structurally defined vaccine candidates identified pff0165c. protein is
exported trophozoite stage named accordingly trophozoite exported 
protein 1 (tex1). extensive preclinical evaluation coiled coil
peptides tex1 identified promising novel malaria vaccine candidate
providing rational comprehensive cell biological characterization of
tex1. antibodies generated intrinsically unstructured n-terminal
region tex1 coiled coil domain used investigate
cytological localization, solubility expression profile. co-localization
experiments revealed tex1 exported across parasitophorous vacuole
membrane located maurer's clefts. change location accompanied a
change solubility: soluble state within parasite a
membrane-associated state export maurer's clefts. classical export
motifs pexel, signal sequence/anchor transmembrane domain was
identified tex1.
