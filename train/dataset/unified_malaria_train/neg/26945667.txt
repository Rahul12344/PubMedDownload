evolution osmoregulatory systems key factor transition species 
between fresh- saltwater habitats. anopheles coluzzii anopheles merus are
stenohaline euryhaline malaria vector mosquitoes belonging larger group 
of sibling species, anopheles gambiae complex, radiated africa
within last 2 million years. comparative ecological genomics vector 
species provide insight mechanisms permitted rapid
radiation species complex habitats contrasting salinity. here, we
use rna-seq investigate gene expression differences an. coluzzii and
an. merus briefly exposing young old larval instars each
species either saltwater (sw) freshwater (fw). study aims identify
candidate genes pathways responsible greater sw tolerance of
an. merus. results congruent ability gene induction to
mediate salinity tolerance, species showing increasing amounts of
differential gene expression sw fw salt concentrations increase.
besides ion transporters agae2 may serve effectors for
osmoregulation, also find mitogen-activated protein kinases may serve 
a phosphorylation signalling pathway responding salinity, report potential
cross-talk mosquito immune response osmoregulation. study
provides key step towards applying growing molecular knowledge these
malaria vectors improve understanding ecological tolerances and
habitat occupancy.
