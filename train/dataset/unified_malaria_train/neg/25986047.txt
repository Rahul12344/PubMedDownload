background: drug resistance one main reasons anti-malarial treatment
failures impedes malaria containment strategies. single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) found correlate anti-malarial drug
resistance, surveillance strategy includes continuous monitoring known
molecular markers detection new mutation patterns. introduction
of artemisinin-based combination therapy, selection specific patterns been
observed worldwide.
methods: march june 2013, whole blood collected filter paper 
microscopically malaria positive patients jimma zone (district), southwestern 
ethiopia. plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium vivax mixed infections were
included. snps investigated conventional real-time pcr, restriction
fragment length pattern analysis sequencing. results compared to
molecular patterns ethiopian isolates 2004, 2006 2008/9.
results: plasmodium falciparum, p. vivax, mixed infections molecularly
confirmed 177, 80, 14 samples, respectively. p. falciparum, mutations
in pfcrt, pfmdr 1and pfatp 6 (serca) gene investigated. whereas the
mutation pfcrt gene codon 76 k still found 95.6% samples,
the pfmdr 1 86 mutation fell 1.2% (2/163) 2013 compared 9% 2008/9
and 86% 2006 (p<0.001). pfmdr 1 184 f mutation dominated 100.0%
(172/172) 2013. sequencing recently reported pf3d7_1343700 kelch
propeller domain showed mutation codon 476. first sequencing data the
pvmdr 1 gene jimma region revealed prevalence mutations 976 f and
1076 l 72.7% (16/23) 100.0% (19/19) isolates, respectively.
conclusion: since introduction artemether-lumefantrine (al) jimma,
ethiopia, 2006, prevalence certain snps associated al use has
increased. markers chloroquine resistance p. vivax highly frequent.
continuous molecular clinical surveillance paramount importance.
