several antimalarial drugs exist, differences life cycle stages among
malaria species pose challenges developing effective therapies. to
understand diversity among stages species, reconstructed genome-scale 
metabolic models (gemms) metabolism five life cycle stages five
species plasmodium spanning blood, transmission, mosquito stages. 
stage-specific models plasmodium falciparum uncovered stage-dependent changes 
in central carbon metabolism predicted potential targets could affect
several life cycle stages. species-specific models highlight
differences experimental animal models human-infecting species.
comparisons human- rodent-infecting species revealed differences in
thiamine (vitamin b1), choline, pantothenate (vitamin b5) metabolism. thus,
we show genome-scale analysis multiple stages species plasmodium
can prioritize potential drug targets could anti-malarials and
transmission blocking agents, addition guiding translation non-human
experimental disease models.
