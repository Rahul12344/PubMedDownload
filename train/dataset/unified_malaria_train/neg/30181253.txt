sexual-stage proteins distinct function mosquito vector during

transmission-blocking vaccine. p48/45, leading vaccine candidate, critical
for male gamete fertility shows >50% similarity across various species of
plasmodium evaluated functional conservation p48/45 plasmodium vivax and
p. berghei motivation establish transgenic p. berghei strains
expressing p. vivax p48/45 (pvs48/45) vivo assay evaluate the
transmission-blocking activity antibodies elicited pvs48/45. homologous
recombination employed target p. bergheis48/45 (pbs48/45) knockout
(ko) replacement two different forms p. vivaxs48/45 (pvs48/45)
(the full-length gene chimeric gene consisting pbs48/45 5' signal 3'
anchor sequences flanking pvs48/45). expression pvs48/45 transgenic
parasites lack expression p48/45 ko parasites confirmed 
reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) western blotting. transgenic and
knockout parasites revealed asexual growth kinetics mice comparable that
seen wild-type parasites. employed mosquito infection experiments,
both transgenic parasite strains remained transmission competent developed
into infectious sporozoites, whereas knockout parasites incapable of
establishing mosquito-stage infection. results indicate functional

malaria transmission depends upon successful sexual differentiation and
maturation parasites vertebrate host development the
mosquito midgut. stage-specific proteins sexual stages shown 
play critical role development successful transmission the
anopheline mosquito vector. studies presented current manuscript evaluated
functional conservation one protein, p48/45, two diverse species
(p. berghei p. vivax). replacement endogenous pbs48/45 p. berghei 
pvs48/45 (p. vivax homologue) affect viability parasites, 
the transgenic parasites expressing pvs48/45 remained transmission competent.
these studies establish functional conservation p48/45 in
p. berghei p. vivax also offer opportunity develop vivo test 
model pvs48/45-based p. vivax transmission-blocking vaccines, currently under
development.
