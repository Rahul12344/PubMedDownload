aim: purpose study identify predictive biomarkers used for
clinical therapy prognostic evaluation high-risk gastrointestinal stromal 
tumors (gists).
materials methods: study, microarray data gse31802 used to
identify differentially expressed genes (degs) high-risk gists and
low-risk gists. then, enrichment analysis degs conducted based gene
ontology kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes pathway database. in
addition, transcription factors cancer-related genes degs were
screened according transfac, tsgene, tag database. finally,
protein-protein interaction (ppi) network constructed analyzed look
for critical genes involved high-risk gists.
results: total forty degs obtained genes mainly involved
in four pathways, including melanogenesis, neuroactive ligand-receptor
interaction, malaria, hematopoietic cell lineage. enriched biological
processes related regulation insulin secretion, integrin
activation, neuropeptide signaling pathway. transcription factor analysis 
degs indicated pou domain, class 2, associating factor 1 (pou2af1) was
significantly downregulated high-risk gists. constructing ppi network
of degs, ten genes high degrees formed local networks, pnoc, p2ry14,
and selp.
conclusions: four genes pou2af1, pnoc, p2ry14, selp might used as
biomarkers prognosis high-risk gists.
