background: selecting blood donors transfusion centres, one important
problem identify, screening, individuals infectious diseases
that transmitted blood, malaria, especially parasite
densities low. problem particularly severe endemic areas,
such brazilian amazon. present study, molecular diagnostic
(real-time pcr) plasmodium vivax used identify blood donors infected
with malaria parasites.
methods: samples 595 blood donors collected seven haemotherapy
centres northern brazil located areas risk malaria transmission, and
the analyses performed real-time pcr taqman probes 7500 real-time
pcr systems, genotype mitochondrial dna region specific p. vivax. the
experiment designed hybridization cytochrome c oxidase genes of
the mitochondrial genome (genbank gi63022502). serological data obtained
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - elisa (anti-hiv, anti-htlv i-ii;
anti-hvc, hbsag, anti-hbc, chagas disease) vdrl (syphilis) blood
bank system haematology haemotherapy centre pará.
results: assay identified eight individuals sample (1.34%) infected
with p. vivax time blood donation. percentage higher 
altered serological results (reactive inconclusive) prevalence of
anti-hiv (0.67%), anti-hepatitis c virus (0.34%), anti-hepatitis b surface
antigen (0.67%), anti-human t-lymphotropic virus i/ii (1.18%), anti-chagas
disease (0.17%) syphilis (vdrl) (0.50%), higher anti-hepatitis b
core antigen antibodies (4.37%). result indicates need use more
sensitive methods diagnosing malaria blood banks.
conclusion: real-time pcr taqman probes enabled identification p.
vivax high proportion clinically healthy donors, highlighting the
potential risk transfusion-transmitted malaria. additionally, molecular 
diagnostic tool adopted new laboratory screening method in
haemotherapy centres, especially malaria-endemic areas.
