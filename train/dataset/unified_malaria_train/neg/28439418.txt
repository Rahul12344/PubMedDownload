background: africa affected continent 200,000 new born affected 
by sickle cell anemia annually 5% five deaths. nigeria the
largest sickle cell gene pool world 2% babies born to
nigerian parents. study therefore sets assess prevention
practices influencing frequency occurrence vaso-occlusive crisis among 
patients ogun state.
methods: study descriptive cross-sectional study conducted abeokuta 
south local government area ogun state. consecutive non randomized sampling 
all sickle cell patients attend selected facilities recruited
into study. data collected use questionnaires were
interviewer administered. total 415 patients recruited study. 
statistical analyses conducted using spss windows version 20.0.
result: two- third [64.8%] study participants crisis twice a
month. frequency crisis statistically significantly associated with
the age child [p = 0.006], use anti-malaria prophylaxis [p = 0.006],
analgesics [p = 0.0001], taking plenty fluid [p = 0.001] soothing herbs
[p = 0.0001]. lifestyle factors giving balance diet [p = 0.217],
restriction strenuous activities [p = 0.08], attending clinic
appointments regularly [p = 0.126] statistically associated with
reduction frequency crisis. logistic regression analysis shows that
predictors frequent crisis individuals using prophylaxis
antimalarial drugs [or = 0.12, ci = 0.05-0.33] analgesics [or = 0.15,
c.i = 0.06-0.34].
conclusion: study reveals majority participants high
frequency crisis month. drug prophylaxis rather lifestyle factors
may important prevention vaso-occlusive crisis among sickle
cell patients.
