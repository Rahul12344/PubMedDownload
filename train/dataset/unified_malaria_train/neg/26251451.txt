eukaryotic pcnas (proliferating-cell nuclear antigens) play diverse roles in
nucleic acid metabolism addition dna replication. plasmodium falciparum,
which causes human malaria, harbours two pcna homologues: pfpcna1 pfpcna2.
the functional role two distinct pcnas parasite still eludes us. the
present study, show that, whereas pfpcnas share structural and
biochemical properties, pfpcna1 functionally complements scpcna mutant
and forms distinct replication foci parasite, pfpcna2 fails do.
although pfpcna1 appears primary replicative pcna, pfpcna1 and
pfpcna2 participate active ddr (dna-damage-response) pathway with
significant accumulation parasite upon dna damage induction.
interestingly, pfpcna genes found regulated transcription
level, presumably protein stability level upon dna damage. such
regulation pcna shown eukaryotes before. moreover,
overexpression pfpcna1 pfpcna2 in parasite confers survival edge 
the parasite genotoxic environment. first evidence a
pfpcna-mediated ddr parasite gives new insights rationale 
presence two pcnas parasite survival strategy probable success.
