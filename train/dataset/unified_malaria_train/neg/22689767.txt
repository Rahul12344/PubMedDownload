motivation: nucleosomes basic elements chromatin structure. they
control packaging dna play critical role gene regulation by
allowing physical access transcription factors. advent of
second-generation sequencing enabled landmark genome-wide studies of
nucleosome positions several model organisms. current methods determine
nucleosome positioning first compute occupancy coverage profile mapping
nucleosome-enriched sequenced reads reference genome; then, nucleosomes 
placed according peaks coverage profile. methods quite
accurate placing isolated nucleosomes, properly handle more
complex configurations. also, provide positions nucleosomes 
and occupancy level, whereas beneficial supply molecular
biologists additional information nucleosomes like probability of
placement, size dna fragments enriched nucleosomes and/or whether
nucleosomes well positioned 'fuzzy' sequenced cell sample.
results: address issues providing novel method based a
parametric probabilistic model. expectation maximization algorithm used 
infer parameters mixture distributions. compare performance 
of method two real datasets template filtering, is
considered current state-of-the-art. synthetic data, show our
method resolve accurately complex configurations nucleosomes, 
is robust user-defined parameters. real data, show method 
detects significantly higher number nucleosomes.
