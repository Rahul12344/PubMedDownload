background: emergence spread resistance plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine (cq) necessitated change cq artemisinin-based combination
therapies (acts) first-line drug management uncomplicated malaria
in ghana 2005. sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) second line
antimalarial drug ghana, adopted intermittent preventive treatment
of malaria pregnancy (iptp). methods: examine prevalence molecular
markers associated cq antifolate drug resistance ghana, employed
restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction genotype
and compare single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter ( pfcrt, pf3d7_0709000), multidrug resistance 
( pfmdr1, pf3d7_0523000), bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate
synthase ( pfdhfr, pf3d7_0417200) dihydropteroate synthase ( pfdhps,
pf3d7_0810800) genes. parasites collected children malaria
reporting hospitals three different epidemiological areas ghana (accra, 
kintampo navrongo) 2012-2013 2016-2017. results: overall
prevalence cq resistance-associated pfcrt 76t allele 8%, whereas
pfmdr1 86y 184f alleles present 10.2% 65.1% infections,
respectively. majority isolates harboured antifolate
resistance-associated pfdhfr alleles 51i (83.4%), 59r (85.9 %) 108n (90.5%). 
pfdhps 437g 540e detected 90.6% 0.7% infections, respectively.
we observed significant difference across three study sites the
polymorphisms except pfdhps 437g , common accra compared to
kintampo 2016-2017 isolates. across pfdhfr pfdhps genes, large
proportion (61%) isolates harboured quadruple mutant combination ( i
51 r 59 n 108/ g 437). cq resistance alleles decreased 12 years 
cq withdrawal, mediate sp resistance alleles increased. conclusion:
surveillance prevalence resistance alleles necessary monitoring
the efficacy antimalarial drugs.
