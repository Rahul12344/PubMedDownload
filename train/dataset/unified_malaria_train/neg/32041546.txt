background: successful mating female mosquitoes typically occurs once, with
the male sperm stored female spermatheca every subsequent
oviposition event. female spermatheca responsible maintenance,
nourishment, protection male sperm damage storage.
aedes aegypti major vector arboviruses, including yellow fever, dengue,
chikungunya, zika. vector control difficult due mosquito high
reproductive capacity.
results: following comparative rna-seq analyses spermathecae obtained from
virgin inseminated females, eight transcripts selected based their
putative roles sperm maintenance survival, including energy metabolism,
chitin components, transcriptional regulation, hormonal signaling, enzymatic
activity, antimicrobial activity, ionic homeostasis. situ rna
hybridization confirmed tissue-specific expression eight transcripts.
following rna interference (rnai), observed outcomes varied targeted
transcripts, affecting mosquito survival, egg morphology, fecundity, sperm
motility within spermathecae.
conclusions: study identified spermatheca-specific transcripts associated
with sperm storage ae. aegypti. using rnai characterized role eight 
spermathecal transcripts various aspects female fecundity offspring
survival. rnai-induced knockdown transcript aesigp-66,427, coding a
na+/ca2+ protein exchanger, specifically interfered egg production and
reduced sperm motility. results bring new insights molecular basis
of sperm storage identify potential targets ae. aegypti control.
