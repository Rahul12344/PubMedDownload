one-fourth plasmodium falciparum proteins asparagine repeats that
increase propensity aggregation, especially elevated temperatures that
occur routinely malaria-infected patients. report plasmodium
asn repeat-containing protein (pfi1155w) formed aggregates mammalian cells 
febrile temperatures, yeast asn/gln-rich protein (sup35). co-expression 
of cytoplasmic p. falciparum heat shock protein 110 (pfhsp110c) prevented
aggregation. human yeast orthologs much less effective. all-asn and
all-gln versions sup35 protected aggregation pfhsp110c,
suggesting chaperone limited handling runs asparagine.
pfhsp110c gene-knockout parasites viable conditional knockdown
parasites died slowly absence protein-stabilizing ligand. exposed 
to brief heat shock, knockdowns unable prevent aggregation of
pfi1155w sup35 died rapidly. conclude pfhsp110c protects the
parasite harmful effects asparagine repeat-rich proteome during
febrile episodes.
