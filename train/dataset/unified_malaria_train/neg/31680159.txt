the eukaryotic promoter database (epd), available online https://epd.epfl.ch, 
provides accurate transcription start site (tss) information promoters 15 
model organisms plus corresponding functional genomics data viewed in
a genome browser, queried analyzed via web interfaces, exported standard
formats (fasta, bed, csv) subsequent analysis tools. recent work
has focused improvement epd promoter viewers, use ucsc
genome browser visualization platform. thousands high-resolution tracks for
cage, chip-seq similar data generated organized public
track hubs. customized, reproducible promoter views, combining epd-supplied
tracks native ucsc genome browser tracks, accessed organism 
summary pages individual promoter entries. moreover, thanks recent
improvements stabilization ncrna gene catalogs, able release
promoter collections certain classes ncrnas human mouse.
furthermore, developed automatic computational protocols assign orphan tss 
peaks downstream genes based paired-end (rampage) tss mapping data, which
enabled us add nearly 9000 new entries human promoter collection. since
our last article journal, epd extended five model organisms: 
rhesus monkey, rat, dog, chicken plasmodium falciparum.
