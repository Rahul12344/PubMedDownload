chronic malaria major public health problem significant challenge for
disease eradication efforts. despite importance, biological factors
underpinning chronic malaria fully understood. recent studies shown 
that host metabolic state influence malaria pathogenesis transmission,
but role chronicity known. here, goal identifying
distinct modifications metabolite profiles acute versus chronic
malaria, metabolomics performed plasma plasmodium-infected humans and
nonhuman primates range parasitemias clinical signs. rhesus
macaques infected plasmodium coatneyi, significant alterations amines,
carnitines, lipids detected high parasitemic acute phase and
many reverted baseline levels low parasitemic chronic phase
was established. plasmodium gene expression, studied parallel macaques,
revealed transcriptional changes amine, fatty acid, lipid energy
metabolism genes, well variant antigen genes. furthermore, common set 
amines, carnitines, lipids distinguished acute chronic malaria plasma
from human plasmodium falciparum cases. summary, distinct host-parasite
metabolic environments uncovered characterize acute versus chronic
malaria, providing insights underlying host-parasite biology malaria 
disease progression.
