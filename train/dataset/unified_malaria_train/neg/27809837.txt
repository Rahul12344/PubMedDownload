background: plasmodium falciparum resistance artemisinin emerged the
greater mekong sub-region associated mutations propeller
domain kelch gene pfk13.
methods: polymorphisms pvk12 gene, orthologue pfk13 in
plasmodium vivax, determined pcr sequencing 262 clinical isolates 
collected recent years (2012-2015) china-myanmar border area.
results: sequencing full-length pvk12 genes isolates identified
three synonymous mutations (n172n, s360s, s697s) one non-synonymous mutation 
m124i, low prevalence (2.0-3.1%). moreover, these
mutations non-overlapping two study sites sides the
border. molecular evolutionary analysis detected signature purifying selection
on pvk12.
conclusions: direct evidence pvk12 involved artemisinin
resistance p. vivax, remains potential candidate requiring further
investigation. continuous monitoring potential drug resistance this
parasite needed order facilitate regional malaria elimination
campaign.
