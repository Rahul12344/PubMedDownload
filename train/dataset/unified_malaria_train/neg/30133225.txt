objective: analyze genetic sequence tryptophan-rich antigen (potra)
gene plasmodium ovale subspecies imported malaria cases henan province
in 2015.
methods: blood samples collected 22 imported ovale malaria cases in
henan province 2015. dna extraction, potra amplified nested pcr, 
and inserted pmd18-t vector. plasmid extracted and
sequenced, results blasted genbank determine subspecies of
p. ovale. sizes species potra gene analyzed. amino-acid
sequence potra also aligned analyze difference amino acid
sequence. phylogenetic tree constructed analyze genetic
relationship among samples neighbor-joining.
results: 22 imported cases, eight (36.4%) infected p. ovale
wallikeri, two sizes, predominant 245 299 bp. 14
cases (63.6%) infected p. ovale curtisi, three sizes, the
predominant 299, 317 335 bp. amino-acid sequence alignment revealed 
two types p. ovale wallikeri differed two amino-acid units, manpinmanpin
and aitpin, three types p. ovale curtisi differed amino-acid
units titpis tinpin. phylogenetic tree showed 22 samples
belonged two subpopulations p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri,
wherein p. ovale curtisi divided two sub-branches, and
samples sizes 317 335 bp sub-branch closer
genetic relationship.
conclusion: two subspecies, p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri, are
identified imported ovale malaria cases henan province 2015. the
p. ovale curtisi three genetic types p. ovale wallikeri two genetic
types potra gene, revealing genetic polymorphisms potra.
