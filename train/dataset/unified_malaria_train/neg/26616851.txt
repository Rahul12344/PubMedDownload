artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria increasing problem southeast
asia, associated increased transmission disease,
yet. recent outbreak 2014 ubon ratchatani, eastern thailand,
parasites 101 patients falciparum malaria genotyped for
antimalarial drug resistance markers. mutations kelch13 marker for
artemisinin resistance present 93% samples, mainly c580y 2 major 
clusters identified microsatellite typing. resistance markers for
antifolates chloroquine also highly prevalent. strains (91%)
carried single copy number pfmdr1, suggesting sustained sensitivity to
mefloquine, partner drug local first-line artemisinin combination
therapy (act). high prevalence artemisinin resistance recent
malaria outbreak suggests prove causative role increased
transmission. careful monitoring act efficacy additional genetic
epidemiological studies warranted guide public health response 
outbreak.
