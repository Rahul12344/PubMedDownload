background: years disuse chloroquine (cq) first-line anti-malarial
drug ghana, reports molecular studies conducted parts country
indicate varying prevalence t76 mutation pfcrt gene. situation has
several health implications, one mutations confer resistance to
cq reported show substantial cross-resistance anti-malarial
drugs. important identify factors contributing the
continuous presence cq resistance markers country. study
determined prevalence t76 mutation pfcrt gene plasmodium falciparum 
isolates collected selected areas central region ghana and
correlated level cq use areas.
methods: plasmodium falciparum dna extracted collected blood-blot filter
paper samples study sites. prevalence t76 point mutation pfcrt
gene assessed using nested pcr followed rflp. cq pharmacy and
chemical shops obtained using mystery buying method. extent cq use 
the participants determined measuring level drug urine
samples using saker-solomon method.
results: 214 p. falciparum isolates analysed, 71.9% found t76
mutation pfcrt gene. study revealed 14.49% community pharmacies
and chemical shops stocks cq sale 16.9% participants 
cq urine samples. five times risks becoming infected
with cq resistant strain staying area cq stocked sale
[rr = 0.20, p < 0.0001] thirteen times risks cq-resistant
mutant still use cq non-users [or = 0.08, p < 0.0001].
conclusion: study shown high variation prevalence t76
mutations p. falciparum linked level cq stocking usage
within study area.
