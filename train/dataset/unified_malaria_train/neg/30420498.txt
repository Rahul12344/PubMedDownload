drug resistance obstacle global malaria control, evidenced the
recent emergence rapid spread delayed artemisinin (art) clearance by
mutant forms pfkelch13 protein southeast asia. identifying genetic
determinants art resistance african-derived parasites important for
surveillance understanding mechanism resistance. study, we
carried long-term vitro selection two recently isolated west african
parasites (from pikine thiès, senegal) increasing concentrations of
dihydroartemisinin (dha), biologically active form art, 4-y period.
we isolated two parasite clones, one original isolate, exhibited
enhanced survival dha ring-stage survival assay. whole-genome sequence 
analysis identified 10 mutations seven different genes. chose focus on
the gene encoding pfcoronin, member wd40-propeller domain protein
family, mutations gene occurred independent selections,
and protein shares β-propeller motif pfkelch13 protein. for
functional validation, pfcoronin mutations introduced parental
parasites crispr/cas9-mediated gene editing, mutations sufficient
to reduce art susceptibility parental lines. discovery second
gene art resistance may yield insights molecular mechanisms of
resistance. also suggests pfcoronin mutants could emerge nonkelch13 
type resistance art natural settings.
