in plasmodium lifecycle two infectious stages parasites, merozoites, and
sporozoites, efficiently infect mammalian host cells, erythrocytes, and
hepatocytes, respectively. apical structure merozoites sporozoites
contains rhoptry microneme secretory organelles, conserved with
other infective forms apicomplexan parasites. merozoite invasion of
erythrocytes, rhoptry proteins secreted form tight junction between
the parasite target cell, others discharged maintain subsequent 
infection inside parasitophorous vacuole. questioned whether 
invasion mechanisms mediated rhoptry proteins also involved sporozoite 
invasion two distinct target cells, mosquito salivary glands mammalian
hepatocytes. recently demonstrated rhoptry neck protein 2 (ron2), which
is crucial tight junction formation merozoites, also important for
sporozoite invasion target cells. aim comprehensively
describing mechanisms sporozoite invasion, expression localization
profiles rhoptry proteins investigated plasmodium berghei sporozoites.
of 12 genes representing merozoite rhoptry molecules, nine transcribed in
oocyst-derived sporozoites similar higher level compared in
blood-stage schizonts. immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates eight
proteins, namely ron2, ron4, ron5, asp/ron1, ralp1, ron3, rap1, rama,
localize rhoptries sporozoites. noteworthy rhoptry neck
proteins merozoites localized throughout rhoptries sporozoites. this
study demonstrates rhoptry proteins, except components the
high-molecular mass rhoptry protein complex, commonly expressed merozoites
and sporozoites plasmodium spp., suggests components the
invasion mechanisms basically conserved infective forms independently
of target cells. combined sporozoite-stage specific gene silencing
strategies, contribution rhoptry proteins invasion mechanisms be
described.
