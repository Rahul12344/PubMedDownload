the continued success malaria control efforts requires development, study 
and implementation new technologies circumvent insecticide resistance. we
previously demonstrated fungal pathogens provide effective delivery
system mosquitocidal malariacidal biomolecules. compared genes
from arthropod predators encoding insect specific sodium, potassium calcium
channel blockers ability improve efficacy metarhizium against
wild-caught, insecticide-resistant anophelines. toxins expressed control of
a hemolymph-specific promoter increased fungal lethality mosquitoes spore
dosages low one conidium per mosquito. one potent, epa
approved hybrid (ca++/k+ channel blocker), studied pre-lethal effects.
these included reduced blood feeding behavior, almost 100% insects
infected ~6 spores unable transmit malaria within 5 days post-infection, 
surpassing world health organization threshold successful vector control 
agents. furthermore, recombinant strains co-expressing hybrid toxin aait (na+
channel blocker) produced synergistic effects, requiring 45% fewer spores kill
half mosquitoes 5 days single toxin strains. results identify 
repertoire toxins different modes action improve utility of
entomopathogens technology compatible existing
insecticide-based control methods.
