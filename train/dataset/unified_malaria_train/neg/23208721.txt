drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria major public health problem. an
elevated pfmdr1 gene copy number (cn) known decrease parasite sensitivity
to commonly used antimalarial mefloquine (mfq). understand the
relationship pfmdr1 cn mefloquine resistance, evaluated pfmdr1
transcript levels three p. falciparum strains different cns the
presence absence mfq. parasite strains multiple pfmdr1 gene copies
exhibited higher relative transcript levels single-copy parasites, mfq
induced pfmdr1 expression levels without treatment three strains
evaluated. concomitant morphology analyses sampled cultures revealed 
mfq treatment synchronized ring-stage parasites induced delay parasite
maturation intraerythrocytic cycle. pfmdr1 expression peaks the
ring stage, mfq could causing increased transcription delaying parasite
maturation. however, pretreatment mefloquine affect artemisinin 
in vitro half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)). results suggest
that mfq-induced increases pfmdr1 expression direct result the
maturation delay ring stage change expression not
affect antimalarial activity artemisinin.
