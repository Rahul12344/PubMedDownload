background: ticks attach penetrate hosts' skin inactivate
multiple components host responses order acquire blood meal.
infestation loads cattle tick, rhipicephalus microplus, heritable:
some breeds carry high loads reproductively successful ticks, whereas in
others, ticks feed reproduce efficiently.
methods: order elucidate mechanisms result different
outcomes infestations cattle ticks, examined global gene expression
and inflammation induced tick bites skins one resistant one
susceptible breed cattle underwent primary infestations larvae and
nymphs r. microplus. also examined expression profiles genes
encoding secreted tick proteins mediate parasitism larvae nymphs
feeding breeds.
results: functional analyses differentially expressed genes skin
suggest allergic contact-like dermatitis develops ensuing production of
il-6, cxcl-8 ccl-2 sustained hmgb1, isg15 pkr, leading to
expression pro-inflammatory chemokines cytokines recruit granulocytes
and lymphocytes. importantly, response delayed susceptible hosts.
histopathological analyses infested skins showed inflammatory reactions
surrounding tick cement cones enable attachment breeds, in
genetically tick-resistant bovines destabilized cone. transcription 
data provided insights tick-mediated activation basophils, have
previously shown key host resistance model systems. skin 
tick-susceptible bovines expressed transcripts encoding enzymes that
detoxify tissues. interestingly, enzymes also produce volatile odoriferous 
compounds and, accordingly, skin rubbings tick-susceptible bovines attracted
significantly tick larvae rubbings resistant hosts. moreover,
transcripts encoding secreted modulatory molecules tick significantly
more abundant larval nymphal salivary glands ticks feeding on
susceptible bovines.
conclusions: compared tick-susceptible hosts, genes encoding enzymes
producing volatile compounds exhibit significantly lower expression resistant 
hosts, may render less attractive larvae; resistant hosts expose
ticks earlier inflammatory response, ticks associated with
significantly lower expression genes encoding salivary proteins suppress 
host immunity, inflammation coagulation.
