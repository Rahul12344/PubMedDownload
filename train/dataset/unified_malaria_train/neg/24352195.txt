dendritic cells (dc) targeting vaccines require high efficiency uptake,
followed dc activation maturation. used magnetic vectors comprising
polyethylenimine (pei)-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, with
hyaluronic acid (ha) different molecular weights (<10 900â€‰kda) reduce
cytotoxicity facilitate endocytosis particles dcs via specific
surface receptors. dna encoding plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein 1-19 
and plasmid encoding yellow fluorescent gene added magnetic
complexes various % charge ratios ha: pei. presence magnetic
fields significantly enhanced dc transfection maturation. vectors containing 
a high-molecular-weight ha 100% charge ratio ha: pei yielded better
transfection efficiency others. phenomenon attributed their
longer molecular chains higher mucoadhesive properties aiding dna
condensation stability. insights gained improve design more
effective dna vaccine delivery systems.
