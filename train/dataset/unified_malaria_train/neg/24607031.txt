background: acute kidney injury (aki) one major complications of
plasmodium falciparum malaria, especially among non-immune adults. has
recently revealed activation transcription factor nuclear factor
kappa b (nf-κb) induces pro-inflammatory gene expression involved the
development progressive renal inflammatory diseases. aim study was
to determine whether urinary sediment nf-κb p65 act biomarker aki in
patients p. falciparum malaria.
methods: urinary sediments malaria patients, including plasmodium vivax
malaria, uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria, complicated p. falciparum malaria
without aki (serum creatinine-cr <3 mg/dl) complicated p. falciparum malaria 
with aki (cr ≥3 mg/dl) used determine nf-κb p65 level sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). urinary sediments obtained from
healthy controls used normal baseline. correlations levels of
urinary sediment nf-κb p65 pertinent clinical data analysed.
results: urinary sediment nf-κb p65 levels significantly increased the
day admission (day 0) day 7 post-treatment complicated p. falciparum
malaria patients aki, compared without aki (p=0.001, p <0.001,
respectively), p. vivax patients (all p <0.001) healthy controls (all p
<0.001). nf-κb p65 levels urinary sediment cells showed significant positive
correlation serum cr (day 0: rs=0.792; p <0.001, day 7: rs=0.605; p <0.001) 
and blood urea nitrogen (bun) (day 0: rs=0.839; p <0.001, day 7: rs=0.596; p
<0.001).
conclusions: urinary sediment nf-κb p65 level useful indicator for
estimating renal tubular epithelial cell damage subsequent development aki
among patients p. falciparum malaria.
