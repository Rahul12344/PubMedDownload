tropical diseases caused parasitic worms protists major public
health concern affecting millions people worldwide. new therapeutic and
diagnostic tools would great help dealing public health and
economic impact diseases. rna interference (rnai) pathways utilize small
non-coding rnas regulate gene expression sequence-specific manner. in
recent years, wealth data mechanisms biological functions of
rnai pathways distinct groups eukaryotes described. often, rnai
pathways unique features restricted groups eukaryotes. the
focus review rnai pathways specific groups parasitic
eukaryotes include trypanosoma cruzi, plasmodium schistosoma mansoni.
these parasites causative agents chagas disease, malaria, and
schistosomiasis, respectively, tropical diseases would
greatly benefit development new diagnostic therapeutic tools. 
this context, describe specific features rnai pathways of
these parasitic eukaryotic groups discuss could exploited the
treatment tropical diseases.
