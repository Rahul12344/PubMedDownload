the mitochondrion malaria parasites contains several clinically validated drug
targets. within plasmodium spp., causative agents malaria, the
mitochondrial dna (mtdna) 6 kb long, smallest mitochondrial
genome among eukaryotes. mtdna encodes three proteins the
mitochondrial electron transport chain ∼27 small, fragmented rrna genes
having lengths 22-195 nucleotides. rrna fragments thought form a
mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), together ribosomal proteins imported 
from cytosol. mitoribosome plasmodium falciparum essential for
maintenance mitochondrial membrane potential parasite viability.
however, role mitoribosome sustaining metabolic status the
parasite mitochondrion remains unclear. small ribosomal subunit p.
falciparum 14 annotated mitoribosomal proteins, employing a
crispr/cas9-based conditional knockdown tool, verified location and
tested essentiality three candidates (pfmtrps12, pfmtrps17, and
pfmtrps18). using immuno-em, provide evidence p. falciparum
mitoribosome closely associated mitochondrial inner membrane. upon
knockdown mitoribosome, parasites became hypersensitive inhibitors
targeting mitochondrial complex iii (bc 1), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhod), 
and f1f0-atp synthase complex. furthermore, mitoribosome knockdown
blocked pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway reduced cellular pool of
pyrimidine nucleotides. results suggest disruption p.
falciparum mitoribosome compromises metabolic capacity mitochondrion, 
rendering parasite hypersensitive panel inhibitors target
mitochondrial functions.
