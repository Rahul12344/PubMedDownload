susceptibility malaria infection associated host genetic
polymorphisms differs groups. hypothesize toll-interacting
proteins (tollip), vitamin receptor (vdr) tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf)
genes significant contributors susceptibility disease severity in
plasmodium falciparum (pf) infection. aim explore genomic diversity
and haplotype frequency genes, well extrapolate possible
association markers severity, malaria-infected healthy
controls. genomic dna samples extracted blood 107 malaria-infected
patients 190 uninfected controls analyzed, difference in
genotypic allelic frequencies tollip vdr polymorphisms. however, a
significant difference genotypic (p = 2.20e-16) allelic frequencies
(p = 2.20e-16) tnf-α (snp rs1800629) polymorphism found. the
preponderance mutant variant among malaria-infected show possible
impaired capacity mount effective immune response, potentially confirmed by
our association results. result calls analysis clearly delineated
uncomplicated versus severe disease groups, including serum assays, providing a
basis conclude susceptibility malaria infection potential
contribution disease severity significantly associated polymorphisms
of tumor necrosis factor-α tollip vdr genes.
