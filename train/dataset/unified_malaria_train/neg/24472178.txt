background: senegalese national malaria control programme recommended use
of rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) target histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2),
specific plasmodium falciparum, diagnose malaria cases. target antigen 
has shown polymorphic, may explain variability hrp2-based
rdt results reported field studies. genetic diversity pfhrp2 gene
has investigated depth many african countries. goal this
study determine extent polymorphism pfhrp2 among senegal, mali
and uganda parasite populations, discuss implications findings
on utility rdts based hrp2 detection.
methods: sequencing data pfhrp2 locus used analyze genetic
diversity gene among three populations, different transmission
dynamics malaria parasite ecologies. nucleotide diversity (π) and
non-synonymous nucleotide diversity (πns) studied pfhrp2 gene from
isolates obtained senegal. amino acid repeat length polymorphisms the
pfhrp2 antigen characterized parameters genetic diversity, as
frequency correlation repeats populations, assessed.
results: diversity survey pfhrp2 gene identified 29 snps well as
insertion deletion polymorphisms within 918 bp region. senegal pfhrp2
exhibited substantial level diversity [π = 0.00559 πns = 0.014111
(πs = 0.0291627)], similar several polymorphic genes, msp1, involved
in immune responses, gene encoding surfin polymorphic antigen, 
are surface exposed parasite proteins. extensive repeat length polymorphisms in
pfhrp2, well similar patterns number, organization type of
predicted amino acid repeats observed among three populations,
characterized occurrence type 2, type 4 type 7 repeats.
conclusions: results warrant deeper monitoring rdt target antigen
diversity emphasize development essential genes target for
diagnostic tools critical.
