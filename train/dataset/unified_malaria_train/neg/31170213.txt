plasmodium ovale curtisi plasmodium ovale wallikeri two sympatric human
malaria species prevalent africa, asia oceania. reported prevalence of
both p. ovale spp. relatively low compared malaria species, more
sensitive molecular detection techniques shown asymptomatic low-density
infections common previously thought. whole genome sequencing of
both p. ovale spp. revealed genetic dissociation p. ovale curtisi p. 
ovale wallikeri suggesting species barrier. study evaluate
such barrier assessing polymorphisms genes three vaccine candidate
surface protein: circumsporozoite protein/ thrombospondin-related
anonymous-related protein (ctrp), circumsporozoite surface protein (csp) and
merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). complete coding sequence ctrp csp,
and partial fragment msp1 isolated 25 p. ovale isolates and
compared previously reported reference sequences. low level nucleotide
diversity (pi = 0.02-0.10) observed three genes. various sizes of
tandem repeats observed ctrp, csp msp1 genes. tandem repeat 
unit nucleotide polymorphism three genes exhibited clear dimorphism
between p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri, supporting evidence of
non-recombination two species.
