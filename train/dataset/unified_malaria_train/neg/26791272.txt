background: rodent malaria parasite plasmodium yoelii important animal 
model studying host-parasite interaction molecular basis malaria
pathogenesis. although draft genome p. yoelii yoelii ym available, and
rna sequencing (rna-seq) data several rodent malaria species (rmp) were
reported recently, variations coding regions structure mrna transcript 
are likely present different parasite strains subspecies. sequencing
of cdna libraries additional parasite strains/subspecies help improve
the gene models genome annotation.
methods: two directional cdna libraries mixed blood stages a
subspecies p. yoelii (p. y. nigeriensis nsm) without mefloquine (mq)
treatment sequenced, sequence reads compared genome 
cdna sequences p. y. yoelii ym public databases investigate single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) coding regions, variations intron-exon
structure differential splicing p. yoelii subspecies, variations 
in gene expression mq pressure.
results: approximately 56 million 100 bp paired-end reads obtained,
providing average ~225-fold coverage coding regions. comparison 
the sequence reads ym genome revealed introns 5' 3' untranslated
regions (utrs), altered intron/exon boundaries, alternative splicing, overlapping
sense-antisense reads, potentially new transcripts. interestingly, comparison
of nsm rna-seq reads obtained ym discovered differentially
spliced introns; e.g., spliced introns one subspecies other.
alignment nsm cdna sequences ym genome sequence also identified
~84,000 snps two parasites.
conclusion: discoveries utr introns differentially spliced introns
between p. yoelii subspecies raise interesting questions potential role of
these introns regulating gene expression evolution malaria parasites.
