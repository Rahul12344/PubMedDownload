the forms anopheles gambiae focus intense study by
malaria researchers evolutionary biologists interested ecological
speciation. divergence occurs three discrete islands genomes are
otherwise nearly identical. "islands speciation" model proposes that
diverged regions contain genes maintained selection face of
gene flow. alternative "incidental island" model maintains gene flow
between effectively zero divergence islands unrelated 
speciation. "divergence island snp" assay used explore spatial and
temporal distributions hybrid genotypes. results revealed hybrid
individuals occur frequencies ranging 5% 97% every population
examined. temporal analysis revealed assortative mating unstable and
periodically breaks down, resulting extensive hybridization. results suggest
that hybrids suffer fitness disadvantage, least hybrid genotypes
are viable. stable introgression 2l speciation island occurred one site
following hybridization event.
