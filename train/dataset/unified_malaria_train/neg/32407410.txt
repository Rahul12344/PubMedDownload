only small fraction antigens expressed malaria parasites been
evaluated vaccine candidates. successful malaria subunit vaccine likely
require multiple antigenic targets achieve broad protection high
protective efficacy. describe protective efficacy novel antigen,
plasmodium yoelii (py) e140 (pye140), evaluated p. yoelii challenge of
mice. vaccines targeting pye140 reproducibly induced 100% sterile
protection inbred outbred murine challenge models. although pye140
immunization induced high frequency multifunctional cd8+ cell responses, as
well cd4+ cell responses, protection mediated pye140 antibodies
acting blood stage parasites. protection mice long-lasting up
to 100% sterile protection twelve weeks post-immunization durable high
titer anti-pye140 antibodies. e140 antigen expressed plasmodium
species, highly conserved p. falciparum lab-adapted strains and
endemic circulating parasites, thus promising lead vaccine candidate for
future evaluation human malaria parasite species.
