background: expression group a-like subset group b plasmodium
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) associated severe
malaria (sm). diversity var sequences combined challenges of
distinct classification patient pathologies made studying role of
distinct pfemp1 variants malaria disease severity challenging. application
of retinopathy recent years provided method clinically
evaluate children cerebral malaria (cm). question whether children
with clinical cm retinopathy represent completely different disease
process subgroup within spectrum cm remains important question 
malaria. current study, use newly designed primer sets best
coverage date large cohort children sm determine role of
var genes malaria disease severity especially cm discriminated by
retinopathy.
methods: performed qrt-pcr targeting different subsets var genes 
on samples ugandan children cm (n = 98, 50 malarial
retinopathy [rp] 47 [rn]), severe malarial anemia (sma, n = 47), 
asymptomatic parasitemia (ap, n = 14). primers used study were
designed based var sequences 226 illumina whole genome sequenced p.
falciparum field isolates.
results: increasing severity illness associated increasing levels 
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr)-binding pfemp1. epcr-binding pfemp1
transcript levels highest children combined cm sma then
decreased level disease severity: rp cm > rn cm > sma > ap.
conclusions: study findings indicate pfemp1 binding epcr important
in pathogenesis sm, including rn cm, suggest increased expression
of epcr-binding pfemp1 associated progressively severe disease.
agents block epcr-binding pfemp1 could provide novel interventions to
prevent decrease disease severity malaria.
