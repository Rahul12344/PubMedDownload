phenotypic observation thioredoxin peroxidase-1 (tpx-1) gene-disrupted
plasmodium berghei (tpx-1 ko) liver-stage performed vitro
infection system order investigate defective liver-stage development a
mouse infection model. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay with
anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody revealed liver schizont stage,
tpx-1 ko parasite cells significantly smaller cells wild-type
parent strain (wt). indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay with
anti-merozoite surface protein-1 antibody, used evaluate late
schizont-stage development, indicated tpx-1 ko schizont development was
similar wt strain development towards merozoite-forming stage (mature
schizont). however, fewer merozoites produced mature tpx-1 ko
schizont mature wt schizont. taken together, results suggest that
tpx-1 may involved merozoite formation liver schizont development.
