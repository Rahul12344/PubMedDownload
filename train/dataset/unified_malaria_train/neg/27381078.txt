malaria life-threatening tropical disease, caused intracellular
parasite plasmodium falciparum. world health organization counts malaria as
one top ten causes worldwide death. unavailability successful 
malaria vaccine ever-increasing instances drug resistance the
malaria parasite demand discovery new targets within p. falciparum the
development next generation antimalarials. fortunately, apicomplexan
parasites, including p. falciparum harbor relict, non-photosynthetic plastid
known apicoplast. apicoplast semi-autonomous organelle within p. 
falciparum containing 35kb circular genome. despite genome own,
majority apicoplast proteins encoded parasite nucleus and
imported apicoplast. organelle shown essential p. 
falciparum survival loss apicoplast manifests 'delayed death'
response parasite. apicoplast evolved cyanobacteria a
complex, two step endosymbiotic event. result architecture gene 
expression machinery apicoplast quite bacteria-like susceptible 
to wide range antibiotics fosmidomycin, tetracycline, azithromycin, 
clindamycin triclosan. biosynthetic pathways isoprenoids, fatty acids
and heme operate within malaria apicoplast, making organelle excellent
target drug development. review focuses evolution, biology the
essentiality apicoplast within malaria parasite discusses 
the recent achievements towards design discovery apicoplast targeted
antimalarial compounds.
