background: malaria caused zoonotic plasmodium knowlesi emerging threat 
in eastern malaysia. despite demonstrated vector competency, unknown
whether human-to-human (h-h) transmission occurring naturally. sought
evidence drug selection pressure antimalarial
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) potential marker h-h transmission.
methods: p. knowlesi dihdyrofolate-reductase (pkdhfr) gene sequenced from
449 p. knowlesi malaria cases sabah (malaysian borneo) genotypes
evaluated association clinical epidemiological factors. homology
modelling using pvdhfr template used assess effect pkdhfr
mutations pyrimethamine binding pocket.
results: fourteen non-synonymous mutations detected, common
being codon t91p (10.2%) r34l (10.0%), resulting 21 different
genotypes, including wild-type, 14 single mutants, six double mutants.
one third p. knowlesi infections pkdhfr mutants; 145 (32%)
patients single mutants 14 (3%) double-mutants. contrast, among
the 47 p. falciparum isolates sequenced, three pfdhfr genotypes found, 
the double mutant 108n+59r fixed triple mutants 108n+59r+51i and
108n+59r+164l occurring frequencies 4% 8%, respectively. two
non-random spatio-temporal clusters identified pkdhfr genotypes. 
was association pkdhfr mutations hyperparasitaemia malaria
severity, hypothesized indicators h-h transmission. orthologous
loci associated resistance p. falciparum mutated pkdhfr.
subsequent homology modelling pkdhfr revealed gene loci 13, 53, 120, 173
as critical pyrimethamine binding, however, mutations 
these sites among 449 p. knowlesi isolates.
conclusion: although moderate diversity observed pkdhfr sabah, there
was evidence reflected selective antifolate drug pressure humans.
