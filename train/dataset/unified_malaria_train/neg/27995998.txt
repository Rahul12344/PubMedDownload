protein phosphorylation important post-translational event the
regulation various essential signaling pathways cell. here, show the
functional characterization fikk family protein kinase rodent malaria
parasite (pbmlfk), expressed mosquito liver stages and
contains two functional c-terminal pexel motifs. demonstrate protein
plays role mosquito liver stages parasite growth. oocysts of
pbmlfk-deficient parasites produced 4-fold fewer sporozoites. liver of
infected mice, pbmlfk-deficient parasites grew 100-fold less wild type
parasites. also show c-terminal domain protein a
functional serine-threonine kinase activity inhibited known
pka inhibitor. transcriptome analysis infected host cells suggests in
absence protein expression 288 host mrnas perturbed 
primarily associated immune system, cell cycle metabolism.
