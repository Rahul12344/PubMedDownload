glutamate-rich protein plasmodium falciparum (pf) antigen found all
stages parasite reported induce clinical immunity. r0 
and r2 regions found exhibit high degree conservation,
therefore serving good vaccine design material. assayed genetic
diversity pf glurp genes r0 r2 regions, well evaluated the
role seasonality allelic frequency. total 402 genomic dna samples,
extracted filter paper blood samples, screened nested polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) analysis pf glurp r0 r2 regions, addition to
fragment analysis polymorphic regions identify allelic diversity the
parasite population. found extensive heterogeneity r2 region in
general, heterogeneity seasonally dependent, indicative region
plasticity. r0 region displayed genetic conservation, expected. we
conclude positive genotyping results glurp r0 region seen 
indicative active pf infection, requiring adequate treatment. addition, 
we advocate extending possibility r0 region genotypic positivity
could serve diagnostic tool, thereby reducing cases untreated poorly
treated infection, contributory recrudescence treatment failure.
