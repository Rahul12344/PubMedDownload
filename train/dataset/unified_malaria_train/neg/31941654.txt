mhc class ii (mhcii) molecules cell surface glycoproteins play an
important role develop adaptive immune responses. mhcii-disease association is
not restricted structural variation alone also may extend genetic
variations, may modulate gene expression. observed variations class 
ii gene expression make possible association mhcii polymorphism
with diseases may relate level gene expression addition the
restriction response ag. understanding extent of, mechanisms
underlying, transcription factor dna binding variation therefore key to
elucidate molecular determinants complex phenotypes. study, we
investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms mhcii-drb regulatory gene
may associated clinical outcomes malaria plasmodium-infected
individuals. end, conducted case-control study compare patients
who mild malaria patients asymptomatic plasmodium
infection. demonstrates gtat haplotype exerts increased drb
transcriptional activity, resulting higher drb expression subsequently
perturbed ag presentation cell activation, higher tlr-mediated innate
immune gene expression, ag clearance, low parasitemia comparison with
haplotypes gtat (gtac, gggt). hence, hypothesized drb gene
promoter polymorphism might lead altered drb gene expression, could
possibly affect tlr-triggered innate immune responses malaria patients.
these genetic findings may contribute understanding pathogenesis of
malaria facilitate rational vaccine design malaria.
