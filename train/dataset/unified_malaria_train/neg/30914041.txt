background: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) recommended intermittent
preventive treatment malaria africa. however, increasing sp resistance
(spr) affects the therapeutic efficacy sp. molecular markers, pfdhfr
(dihydrofolate reductase) pfdhps (dihydropteroate synthase) genes widely 
used spr surveillance. study aimed assess prevalence pfdhfr
and pfdhps genes mutations haplotypes plasmodium falciparum isolates
collected bioko island, equatorial guinea (eg).
methods: total, 180 samples collected 2013-2014. single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) pfdhfr pfdhps genes identified nested
pcr sanger sequencing. genotypes linkage disequilibrium (ld) tests
were also analysed.
results: sequences pfdhfr pfdhps genes obtained 92.78% (167/180)
and 87.78% (158/180) samples, respectively. pfdhfr, 97.60% (163/167), 
87.43% (146/167) 97.01% (162/167) samples carried n51i, c59r s108n
mutant alleles, respectively. prevalence pfdhps s436a, a437g, k540e,
a581g, a613s mutations observed 20.25% (32/158), 90.51% (143/158),
5.06% (8/158), 0.63% (1/158), 3.16% (5/158) samples, respectively. 
total, 3 unique haplotypes pfdhfr locus 8 haplotypes pfdhps
locus identified. triple mutation (cirni) pfdhfr prevalent
haplotype (86.83%), single mutant haplotype (sgkaa; 62.66%) predominant
in pfdhps. total 130 isolates 12 unique haplotypes found the
pfdhfr pfdhps combined haplotypes, 65.38% (85/130) carried quadruple 
allele combinations (cirni-sgkaa), whereas one isolate (0.77%, 1/130) was
found carry wild-type (cncsi-sakaa). ld analysis, pfdhfr n51i 
significantly associated pfdhps a437g (p < 0.05).
conclusion: bioko island possesses high prevalence pfdhfr triple
mutation (cirni) pfdhps single mutation (sgkaa), undermine the
pharmaceutical effect sp malaria treatment strategies. avoid an
increase spr, continuous molecular monitoring additional control efforts
are urgently needed bioko island, equatorial guinea.
