background: cerebral malaria (cm) clinical syndrome resulting from
plasmodium falciparum infection. wide range clinical manifestations follow
the disease including cognitive dysfunction, seizures coma. cm pathogenesis
remains incompletely understood without treatment condition is
invariably fatal. artesunate accepted effective drug for
treating severe malaria. besides antiparasitic activity, anti-inflammatory
property also reported. current study, immunomodulatory role 
of artesunate investigated using plasmodium berghei anka model cm,
trough evaluation behavioural changes cytokines expression hippocampus 
and frontal cortex.
methods: c57bl/6 mice infected p. berghei intraperitoneal route,
using standardized inoculation 106 parasitized erythrocytes. memory function
was evaluated using step-down inhibitory avoidance test. mrna expression 
of ifn-γ, il-1β, il-6 tnf frontal cortex hippocampus control
and infected mice day 5 post-infection estimated quantitative real
time pcr. plasmodium berghei -infected mice also received intraperitoneally a
single dose artesunate (32 mg/kg) day 4 post-infection, 24 hours 
treatment behavioural immunological analysis performed. protein
levels cytokines il-2, il-6, il-10, il-17, ifn-γ, tnf serum, frontal
cortex hippocampus controls p. berghei -infected mice treated not
treated artesunate determined using cytometric bead array (cba) kit. 
the survival neurological symptoms cm also registered.
results: cm mice presented significant impairment aversive memory compared
to controls day 5 post-infection. higher mrna expression pro-inflammatory
cytokines found hippocampus frontal cortex infected mice. a
single dose artesunate also able decrease expression of
inflammatory cytokines hippocampus frontal cortex p.
berghei-infected mice. parallel, significant improvement neurological
symptoms survival observed artesunate treated mice.
conclusions: summary, current study provided evidence cm
affects key brain areas related cognition process. addition, different
patterns cytokine expression course cm could modulated a
single administration anti-malarial artesunate.
