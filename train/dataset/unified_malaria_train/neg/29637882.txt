cerebral malaria (cm) remains important cause morbidity mortality. risk
for developing cm partially depends host genetic factors, including variants
encoded type interferon (ifn) receptor 1 (ifnar1). type ifns bind to
ifnar1 resulting increased expression ifn responsive genes, modulate 
innate adaptive immune responses. comprehensively study ifnar1 genetic
variant associations malawians cm uncomplicated malaria, used tag
single nucleotide polymorphism approach, based hapmap yoruba ibadan,
nigeria, population database. identified three novel (rs914142, rs12626750,
and rs1041867) one previously published (chr21:34696785 [c > g]) ifnar1
variants associated cm. variants gene regulatory 
regions. chr21:34696785 (c > g) region encoding histone modifications and
transcription factor-binding sites, suggests gene regulatory activity.
rs12626750 predicted bind embryonic lethal abnormal vision system-like
rna-binding protein 1, rna-binding protein increase type ifn
response. furthermore, examined variants expression quantitative
trait loci database found protective variant, rs914142, associated 
with lower expression ifnar1, whereas cm-associated variant rs12626750 was
associated increased ifnar1 expression, suggesting activation the
type ifn pathway may contribute pathogenesis cm. future functional
studies ifnar1 variants needed clarify role pathway 
severe malarial diseases.
