background: artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) partner drugs, currently 
used ghana lumefantrine, amodiaquine piperaquine. plasmodium
falciparum isolates reduced susceptibility partner drugs may affect
treatment outcome. mutations pfmdr1 gene linked reduced parasite
susceptibility amodiaquine lumefantrine. addition, potency the
partner drugs vivo depends metabolism cytochrome p450 (cyp)
enzyme host. mutations cyp2c8 cyp3a4 genes linked to
reduced metabolism amodiaquine lumefantrine vitro, respectively. this
study investigated host parasite genetic factors affecting the
susceptibility malaria parasite act partner drugs.
methods: archived samples 240 patients age ≤ 9 years participating in
anti-malarial drug resistance survey ghana, given artemether with
lumefantrine (al) artesunate amodiaquine (aa), selected and
analysed. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed sanger sequencing used 
to determine polymorphisms cyp2c8, cyp3a4 pfmdr1 genes.
results: cyp3a4, wild type alleles, suggesting hosts are
good metabolizers lumefantrine. cyp2c8 60% wild type alleles, 35%
heterozygous 5% homozygous recessive alleles suggesting efficient metabolism 
of amodiaquine hosts. pfmdr1 gene, codon 86, 95% wild type
(n86) 5% mutant (y86). codon 184, 36% wild type (y184) 64%
mutant (f184) codons 1034, 1042 1246, 100% (all) wild type.
the high prevalence n86-f184-d1246 haplotype (nfd) suggest presence of
parasites reduced susceptibility lumefantrine amodiaquine.
delayed clearance observed individuals mutations pfmdr1 gene
and cytochrome 450 gene. synonymous non-synonymous mutations were
observed pfmdr1 low prevalence.
conclusion: outcome study indicates parasite's genetic
factors rather host's likely drive resistance act ghana.
