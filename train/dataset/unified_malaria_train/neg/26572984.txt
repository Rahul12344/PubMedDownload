background: plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (pvama-1) leading
candidate antigen blood stage malaria vaccine. however, antigenic variation
is major obstacle development effective vaccine based this
antigen. study, genetic structure effect natural selection
of pvama-1 among korean p. vivax isolates analysed.
methods: blood samples collected 66 korean patients vivax malaria.
the entire pvama-1 gene amplified polymerase chain reaction cloned
into ta cloning vector. pvama-1 sequence isolate sequenced 
the polymorphic characteristics effect natural selection analysed
using dnastar, mega4, dnasp programs.
results: thirty haplotypes pvama-1, classified seven
different clusters, identified 66 korean p. vivax isolates. domain ii
was highly conserved among sequences, substantial nucleotide diversity
was observed domains iii. difference rates of
non-synonymous synonymous mutations suggested gene evolved under
natural selection. strong evidence indicating balancing positive selection 
on pvama-1 identified. recombination may also play role resulting
genetic diversity pvama-1.
conclusions: study first comprehensive analysis nucleotide
diversity across entire pvama-1 gene using single population sample from
korea. korean pvama-1 limited genetic diversity compared pvama-1 global
isolates. overall pattern genetic polymorphism korean pvama-1 differed 
from global isolates novel amino acid changes also identified in
korean pvama-1. evidences natural selection recombination event were
observed, likely play important role generating genetic
diversity across pvama-1. results provide useful information the
understanding population structure p. vivax circulating korea 
important implications design vaccine incorporating pvama-1.
