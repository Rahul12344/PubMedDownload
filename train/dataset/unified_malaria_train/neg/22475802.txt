background: nowadays, possible collect expression levels set of
genes set biological samples series time points. data 
have three dimensions: gene-sample-time (gst). thus called 3d microarray
gene expression data. take advantage 3d data collected, fully
understand biological knowledge hidden gst data, novel subspace
clustering algorithms developed effectively address biological 
problem corresponding space.
results: developed subspace clustering algorithm called order preserving
triclustering (optricluster), 3d short time-series data mining. optricluster 
is able identify 3d clusters coherent evolution given 3d dataset
using combinatorial approach sample dimension, order preserving 
(op) concept time dimension. fusion two methodologies allows
one study similarities differences samples terms their
temporal expression profile. optricluster successfully applied four
case studies: immune response mice infected malaria (plasmodium chabaudi), 
systemic acquired resistance arabidopsis thaliana, similarities and
differences inner outer cotyledon brassica napus seed
development, brassica napus whole seed development. studies showed
that optricluster robust noise able detect similarities and
differences biological samples.
conclusions: analysis showed optricluster generally outperforms other
well known clustering algorithms tricluster, gtricluster k-means;
it robust noise effectively mine biological knowledge hidden in
the 3d short time-series gene expression data.
