antimalarial resistance inevitable feature control efforts key
threat achieving malaria elimination. plasmodium falciparum, deadliest 
several species causing human malaria, developed resistance essentially
all antimalarials. study sought investigate prevalence molecular
markers associated resistance sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) and
artemether-lumefantrine (al) southern western provinces zambia. sp is
used primarily intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy, al
is first-line antimalarial uncomplicated malaria zambia. blood samples
were collected household members ages cross-sectional survey
conducted peak malaria transmission, april may 2017, amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). amplicons analysed by
high-resolution melt following pcr identify mutations associated sp
resistance p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) p.
falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes lumefantrine resistance in
the p. falciparum multi-drug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) gene. finally, artemether
resistance assessed p. falciparum kelch 13 (pfk13) gene using nested
pcr followed amplicon sequencing. results showed high frequency of
genotypic-resistant pfdhps a437g (93.2%) pfdhfr c59r (86.7%), n51i (80.9%),
and s108n (80.8%) high proportion (82.4%) quadruple mutants
(pfdhfr n51i, c59r, s108n +pfdhps a437g). pfmrd1 n86y, y186f, d1246y - nfd
mutant haplotypes observed 41.9% isolates. high prevalence of
quadruple dhps/dhfr mutants indicates strong antifolate drug pressure sp 
other drugs (e.g., co-trimoxazole). three samples contained pfk13 mutations, two 
synonymous (t478 v666) one non-synonymous (a578s), none have
been associated delayed clearance. suggests artemisinin remains
efficacious zambia, however, moderately high prevalence approximately
40% pfmdr1 nfd mutations calls close monitoring al.
