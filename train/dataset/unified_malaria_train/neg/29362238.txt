plasmodium falciparum, major cause malaria morbidity mortality in
humans, shown emerged cross-species transmission one of
six host-specific parasites (subgenus laverania) infecting wild chimpanzees (pan 
troglodytes) western gorillas (gorilla gorilla). binding the
parasite-encoded ligand rh5 host protein basigin essential for
erythrocyte invasion implicated host specificity. recent study 
claimed found two amino acid changes rh5 "drove host shift
leading emergence p. falciparum human pathogen." however, ape 
laverania data available time, included single distantly
related chimpanzee parasite sequence, inadequate justify such
conclusion. here, investigated laverania rh5 gene evolution using
sequences six ape parasite species. searching gene-wide episodic
selection across entire laverania phylogeny, found eight codons be
under positive selection, including three correspond contact residues
known form hydrogen bonds p. falciparum rh5 human basigin. one 
these sites (residue 197) changed subsequent transmission apes to
humans gave rise p. falciparum, suggesting possible role the
adaptation gorilla parasite human host. also found evidence that
the patterns nucleotide polymorphisms p. falciparum typical of
laverania species likely reflect recent demographic history human 
parasite.importance number closely related, host-specific malaria parasites 
infecting wild chimpanzees gorillas recently described. most
important cause human malaria, plasmodium falciparum, known have
resulted cross-species transmission one gorilla parasites.
overcoming species-specific interactions parasite ligand, rh5, 
receptor host cells, basigin, likely important step origin of
the human parasite. investigated evolution rh5 gene found 
evidence adaptive changes diversification ape parasite
species sites known form bonds human basigin. one these
changes occurred origin p. falciparum, implicating important
adaptation human host.
