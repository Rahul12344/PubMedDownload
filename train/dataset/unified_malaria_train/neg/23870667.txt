background: artesunate/sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (as/sp) first-line
treatment falciparum malaria sudan since 2004. impact this
combination anti-malarial resistance-associated molecular markers been
investigated. study, evaluation efficacy prevalence drug
resistance alleles (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr pfdhps) eight years the
adoption as/sp eastern sudan reported.
methods: 28-day follow-up efficacy trial as/sp conducted eastern
sudan 2012 transmission season. blood smears collected from
patients days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 28. blood spots filter paper were
obtained pre-treatment day patient parasite positive by
microscopy. genotyping alleles performed qpcr (pfcrt 72-76 pfmdr1
copy number) direct sequencing pfmdr1, pfdhfr pfdhps.
results: sixty-three patients 68 (93%) completed 28-day follow-up,
adequate clinical, parasitological response occurred 90.5% 85.3% of
the patients per-protocol intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. pcr 
corrected per-protocol efficacy 93.7%. enrolment prevalence of
pfcrt-cvmnk 30.2% pfmdr1-n86 40.3%. pfmdr1 haplotype nfd occurred
in 32.8% pre-treatment samples significantly higher previous
reports (fisher's exact p = 0.0001). pfdhfr-51i/108n combination occurred 
all sequenced isolates 59r observed single individual. pfdhps
substitutions 436a, 437g, 540e, 581g 613s observed 7.8, 77.3, 76.9%, 
33.8% 0.0%, respectively. treatment failures associated pfdhps 
haplotype sgega five codons (or 7.3; 95% ci 0.65 - 368; p = 0.048).
conclusion: decrease cqr associated genotypes reflects formal policy
of complete removal cq sudan. however, frequency markers associated 
with sp failure increasing study area may contributing the
treatment efficacy falling 90%. monitoring as/sp efficacy of
post-treatment selection pfdhfr pfdhps alleles vivo required to
inform future treatment guidelines.
