plasmodium malaria parasites multiply within erythrocytes possess a
repertoire proteins whose function recognize invade vertebrate
host cells. one protein involved erythrocyte invasion micronemal
protein, erythrocyte binding-like (ebl), studied potential
target vaccine development plasmodium vivax (pvdbp) plasmodium
falciparum (eba-175). rodent malaria parasite model plasmodium yoelii,
specific substitutions ebl regions responsible intracellular
trafficking (17xl parasite line) receptor recognition (17x1.1pp. parasite
line), paradoxically increase invasion ability virulence rather abolish 
ebl function. attempts disrupt ebl gene locus 17xl 17xnl lines 
were unsuccessful, suggesting ebl essentiality. understand mechanisms
behind potentially conflicting outcomes, generated 17xl-based
transfectants ebl expression suppressed anhydrotetracycline
(atc) investigated merozoite behavior erythrocyte invasion. the
absence atc, ebl secreted merozoite surface, whereas following atc 
administration parasitemia negligible vivo. merozoites lacking ebl were
unable invade erythrocytes vitro, indicating ebl critical role
for erythrocyte invasion. quantitative time-lapse imaging revealed atc 
administration significant number merozoites detached the
erythrocyte erythrocyte deformation event echinocytosis was
observed, indicating ebl required merozoites establish an
irreversible connection erythrocytes invasion.
