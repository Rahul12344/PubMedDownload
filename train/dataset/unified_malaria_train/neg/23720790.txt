genetic polymorphisms malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum mediate
alterations sensitivity important antimalarial drugs. surveillance for
these polymorphisms helpful assessing prevalence drug resistance and
designing strategies malaria control. multiple methods available 
assessment p. falciparum genetic polymorphisms, suffer low
throughput, technical limitations, high cost. optimized tested 
multiplex ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere (ldr-fm) assay for
the identification important p. falciparum genetic polymorphisms. 84
clinical samples kampala, uganda, region transmission intensity
and infection complexity high, dna extracted dried blood spots,
genes interest amplified, amplicons subjected multiplex ligase
detection reactions add bead-specific oligonucleotides biotin, fragments
were hybridized magnetic beads, polymorphism prevalences assessed
fluorometrically multiplex format. total 19 alleles pfcrt,
pfmdr1, pfmrp1, pfdhfr, pfdhps genes analyzed ldr-fm restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses. considering samples results
from two assays, concordance assays good, 78 100% 
results identical individual alleles, nonconcordant results differing
only mixed pure genotype call, full disagreement individual 
alleles 0 3% results. estimate ldr-fm assay offers much
higher throughput lower cost rflp. results suggest ldr-fm
system offers accurate high-throughput means classifying genetic
polymorphisms field samples p. falciparum.
