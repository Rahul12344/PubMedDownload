in vitro cultivation plasmodium falciparum critical studying the
biology parasite. however, likely different vitro
cultivation conditions influence various aspects parasite's life cycle. in
the present study two p. falciparum isolates cultivated using two most
common methods, albumax human serum additives used, the
results compared. type cultivation influenced knob structure of
p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies). ies cultivated albumax fewer 
knobs cultivated human serum. furthermore, knob size varied
between isolates also depended culture medium. addition, there
was greater reduction cytoadhesion ies various endothelial
receptors presence albumax presence human serum.
surprisingly, cytoadhesion correlate presence absence of
knobs. greater numbers variant surface antigen families rifin, stevor, and
pfmc-2tm found ie membrane cultivated presence of
albumax. moreover, type cultivation marked influence the
transcriptome profile. compared cultivation human serum, cultivation
with albumax increased expression approximately 500-870 genes.
