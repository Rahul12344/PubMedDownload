single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pfmdr1, pfcrt, genes of
plasmodium falciparum may confer resistance number anti-malaria drugs.
pfmdr1 86y haplotypes pfcrt 72-76 linked chloroquine (cq) 
well amodiaquine (aq) resistance. mefloquine (mq) lumefantrine (lu)
sensitivities linked pfmdr1 86y. additionally, pfcrt k76 allele carrying
parasites shown tolerance lu. investigated association between
pfmdr1 86/pfcrt 72-76 p. falciparum resistance cq, aq, mq lu using
field samples collected 2008-2011 malaria endemic sites western
kenya. genomic dna samples genotyped examine snps and
haplotypes pfmdr1 pfcrt respectively. additionally, immediate ex vivo 
in vitro drug sensitivity profiles assessed using malaria sybr green i
fluorescence-based assay. observed rapid steady percent increase in
wild-type parasites regard pfmdr1 pfcrt 2008 2011
(p<0.0001). equally, significant reciprocate decrease aq cq median ic50 
values occurred (p<0.0001) period. thus, data study
point significantly rapid change parasite response aq cq the
study period. may due releasing drug pressure parasite 
reduced use aq face increased artemisinin (art) combination therapy 
(act) administration following intervention global fund 2008. lu
has shown select 76k genotypes, thus observed increase 76k
genotypes coupled significant cross resistance lu mq, may herald
emergence tolerance drugs future.
