the fight plasmodium falciparum, species responsible 90% the
lethal forms human malaria, took new direction publication its
genome 2002. however, hopes genome help bringing the
foreground expected new "vaccines candidates" "targets new medicines"
were disappointed low number genes could functionally
annotated--less 40% upon genome publication, 50% eight years
later. 10% gain knowledge made possible efforts entire 
scientific community many directions include: production of
transcriptomic proteomic profiles various stages parasite
development response drug stress treatments; proteomic study 
subcellular compartments; sequencing numerous plasmodium related species
(allowing whole genome comparisons) sequencing numerous p. falciparum 
strains (allowing investigations gene polymorphism). parallel this
production experimental biological data, development original mining
tools adapted p falciparum specificities quickly appeared priority,
as performances "classical" bioinformatic tools, used successfully for
other genomes, limited efficacy. aim plasmoexplore
project launched 2007. brief review cover efforts made by
the international community decipher p falciparum genome focuses on
improvements novel mining methods investigated plasmoexplore
consortium, lessons could learn efforts.
