background: induction sterile immunity long lasting protection against
malaria effectively achieved immunization sporozoites attenuated
by gamma-irradiation deletion genes. mice immunized with
radiation attenuated sporozoites (ras) shown intrahepatic
effector memory cd8+ cells critical protection. recent studies have
shown immunization genetically attenuated parasites (gap) mice is
also conferred liver effector memory cd8+ cells.
findings: study analysed effector memory cell responses after
immunization gap lack p52 protein. demonstrate immunization
with p52-gap sporozoites also results strong increase effector memory
cd8+ cells, even 6 months immunization, whereas specific cd4+ effector
t cells response could detected. addition, show increase of
effector memory cd8+ cells specific liver spleen 
lymph nodes.
conclusions: results indicate immunization mice p. berghei
p52-gap results immune responses comparable induced ras
or gap lacking expression uis3 uis4, important role implicated 
intrahepatic effector memory cd8+ cells. knowledge mediators of
protective immunity immunization different gap important the
further development vaccines consisting genetically attenuated sporozoites.
