different functions attributed cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) regulatory
t-cells (tregs) malaria infection. herein, describe disparity in
treg response pro- anti-inflammatory cytokines infection with
plasmodium berghei anka young (3-week-old) middle-aged (8-month-old) 
c57bl/6 mice. young mice susceptible cerebral malaria (cm), the
middle-aged mice resistant cm succumbed hyperparasitemia and
severe anemia. levels pro-inflammatory cytokines, tnf-Î±, young 
cm-susceptible mice markedly higher middle-aged cm-resistant mice.
an increased absolute number tregs 3-5 days post-inoculation, co-occurring
with elevated il-10 levels, observed middle-aged cm-resistant mice not
in young cm-susceptible mice. findings suggest treg proliferation might 
be associated suppression excessive pro-inflammatory th1 response
during early malaria infection, leading resistance cm middle-aged
mice, possibly il-10-dependent manner.
