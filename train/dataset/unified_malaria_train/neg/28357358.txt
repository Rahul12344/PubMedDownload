malaria mosquito-borne infectious disease humans animals. is
caused parasitic protozoan, plasmodium. sporozoites, infectious form
of malaria parasites, quiescent remain salivary glands of
the anopheles mosquito transmission mammalian host. metamorphosis of
the dormant sporozoite active form liver stage requires
transcriptional translational regulations. here, summarize recent advances
in translational repression gene expression malaria sporozoite. 
sporozoites, many mrnas required liver stage development are
translationally repressed. phosphorylation eukaryotic initiation factor 2α
(eif2α) leads global translational repression sporozoites. eif2α
kinase, known upregulated infectious sporozoite 1 (uis1), dominant in
the sporozoite. eif2α phosphatase, uis2, translationally repressed 
pumilio protein puf2. translational repression alleviated when
sporozoites delivered mammalian host.
