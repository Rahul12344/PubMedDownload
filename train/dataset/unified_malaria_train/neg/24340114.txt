recent sequencing plasmodium vivax field isolates monkey-adapted strains
enabled characterization snps throughout genome. analyses relied 
mapping short reads onto p. vivax reference genome generated using
dna monkey-adapted strain salvador i. genomic locus deleted 
strain would lacking reference genome sequence missed previous
analyses. here, report de novo assembly p. vivax field isolate genome.
out 2,857 assembled contigs, identify 362 contigs, containing more
than 5 kb contiguous dna sequences absent reference genome sequence. 
these novel p. vivax dna sequences account 3.8 million nucleotides and
contain 792 predicted genes. contigs contain members multigene
families likely originate telomeric regions. interestingly, identify 
two contigs containing predicted protein coding genes similar known plasmodium
red blood cell invasion proteins. one gene encodes reticulocyte-binding
protein gene orthologous p. cynomolgi rbp2e p. knowlesi nbpxb. second 
gene harbors hallmarks plasmodium erythrocyte-binding protein,
including conserved duffy-binding like c-terminus cysteine-rich domains.
phylogenetic analysis shows novel gene clusters separately all
known plasmodium duffy-binding protein genes. additional analyses showing that
this gene present p. vivax genomes transcribed blood-stage
parasites suggest p. vivax red blood cell invasion mechanisms may more
complex currently understood. strategy employed complements
previous genomic analyses takes full advantage next-generation sequencing 
data provide comprehensive characterization genetic variations this
important malaria parasite. analyses novel protein coding genes
discovered de novo assembly potential identify genes that
influence key aspects p. vivax biology, including alternative mechanisms of
human erythrocyte invasion.
