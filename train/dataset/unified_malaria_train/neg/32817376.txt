in plasmodium life cycle, two infectious stages parasites, merozoites 
sporozoites, share rhoptry microneme apical structures. crucial step during
merozoite invasion erythrocytes discharge host cell membrane 
some rhoptry neck proteins complex, followed formation moving
junction involving parasite-secreted protein ama1 parasite membrane.
components merozoite rhoptry neck protein complex also expressed in
sporozoites, namely, ron2, ron4, ron5, suggesting invasion mechanism
elements might conserved infective stages. recently, we
demonstrated ron2 required sporozoite invasion mosquito salivary
gland cells mammalian hepatocytes, using sporozoite stage-specific gene
knockdown strategy rodent malaria parasite model, plasmodium berghei here,
we use coimmunoprecipitation assay oocyst-derived sporozoite extracts to
demonstrate ron2, ron4, ron5 also form complex sporozoites. the
sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown strategy revealed ron4 and
ron5 crucial roles sporozoite invasion salivary glands, including 
a significantly reduced attachment ability required onset gliding.
further analyses indicated ron2 ron4 reciprocally affect trafficking 
rhoptries developing sporozoites, ron5 independently transported.
these findings indicate interaction ron2 ron4 contributes to
their stability trafficking rhoptries, addition involvement in
sporozoite attachment.importance sporozoites motile infectious stage that
mediates malaria parasite transmission mosquitoes mammalian host.
this study addresses question whether rhoptry neck protein complex forms 
and functions sporozoites, addition role merozoites. applying 
coimmunoprecipitation sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown assays, was
demonstrated ron2, ron4, ron5 form complex involved in
sporozoite invasion salivary glands via attachment ability. these
findings shed light conserved invasion mechanisms among apicomplexan
infective stages. addition, sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown
system revealed first time plasmodium ron2 ron4
interaction reciprocally affects stability trafficking rhoptries.
our study raises possibility ron complex functions sporozoite
maturation well migration toward invasion target cells.
