efforts knock plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 1
(pfcdpk1) asexual erythrocytic stage successful, indicating an
indispensable role enzyme asexual growth. recently reported
generation transgenic parasite mutant cdpk1 [bansal a, et al. (2016)
mbio 7:e02011-16]. mutant cdpk1 (t145m) reduced activity of
transphosphorylation. reasoned cdpk1 could disrupted mutant
parasites. consistent assumption, cdpk1 successfully disrupted in
the mutant parasites using crispr/cas9. others could disrupt pfcdpk1
in wt parasites. cdpk1 ko parasites show slow growth rate compared with
the wt cdpk1 t145m parasites. additionally, cdpk1 ko parasites show a
defect male female gametogenesis could establish infection
in mosquitoes. complementation ko parasite full-length pfcdpk1
partially rescued asexual growth defect mosquito infection. comparative
global transcriptomics wt cdpk1 ko schizonts using rna-seq show
significantly high transcript expression gametocyte-specific genes the
cdpk1 ko parasites. study conclusively demonstrates cdpk1 good
target developing transmission-blocking drugs.
