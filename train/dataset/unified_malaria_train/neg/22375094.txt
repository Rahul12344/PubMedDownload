the plasmodium falciparum genome at-rich, presence gc-rich regions
suggests functional significance. evolution imposes selection pressure retain 
functionally important coding regulatory elements. hence searching for
evolutionarily conserved gc-rich, intergenic regions at-rich genome will
help discovering new coding regions regulatory elements. used
elevated gc content intergenic regions coupled sequence conservation
against p. reichenowi, evolutionarily closely related p. falciparum
to identify potential sequences functional importance. interestingly, ~30% 
the gc-rich, conserved sequences associated antigenic proteins encoded 
by var rifin genes. majority sequences identified 5' utr var
genes represented short expressed sequence tags (ests) cdna libraries
signifying transcribed parasite. additionally, 19 sequences 
were located 3' utr rifins 4 also overlapping ests. further
analysis showed several sequences associated var genes the
capacity encode small peptides. previous report shown upstream
peptides regulate expression var genes hence propose these
conserved gc-rich sequences may play roles regulation gene expression.
