the recent discovery previously unknown genetic subgroup anopheles
gambiae sensu lato underscores incomplete understanding complexities of
vector population demographics anopheles. subgroup, named goundry, does
not rest indoors adults highly susceptible plasmodium infection in
the laboratory. initial description goundry suggested differed other
known anopheles taxa surprising sometimes contradictory ways, raising a
number questions age, population size relationship known
subgroups. address questions, sequenced complete genomes 12
wild-caught goundry specimens compared genomes panel anopheles 
genomes. show goundry closely related anopheles coluzzii, 
the timing cladogenesis recent, substantially predating advent of
agriculture. find large region x chromosome swept to
fixation goundry within last 100 years, may inversion that
serves partial barrier contemporary gene flow. interestingly, show
that goundry history inbreeding significantly associated with
susceptibility plasmodium infection laboratory. results illuminate 
the genomic evolution one probably several cryptic, ecologically
specialized subgroups anopheles provide potent example vector
population dynamics may complicate efforts control eradicate malaria.
