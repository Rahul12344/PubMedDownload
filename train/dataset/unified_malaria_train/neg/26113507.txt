antimalarial drug resistance including artemisinin resistance plasmodium
falciparum malaria major concern combating malaria throughout world. 
delayed parasite clearance time (pct) indicative emergence artemisinin
resistance. herein, pct monitored help gold standard
technique microscopy accompanied sensitive real-time assay academic
purpose. administration artemisinin based combination therapy,
artesunate + sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (as + sp), subjects followed 
up day 42 monitoring therapeutic efficacy + sp bisra
community health centre (chc), sundergarh district state odisha in
india. further, representative samples analyzed l263e, e431k, a623e 
s769n snps pfatpase6 gene copy number polymorphisms pfmdr1 gene. though
all samples found parasite negative according microscopy end
of day 3 attained adequate clinical parasitological response (acpr) at
the end day 42, real-time pcr showed day 3 positivity 12 total
analyzed samples (n = 43). validated end-point diagnostic pcr
and correlated high initial parasite load. e431k mutation observed 2 
of 12 samples (16.7 %) controls (n = 18) wild. l263e,
a623e s769n wild analyzed samples (n = 30). pfmdr1 copy
number analysis showed change said trait. conclusively, real-time pcr
could support microscopy better monitoring pct may provide an
additional useful research tool artemisinin resistance studies.
