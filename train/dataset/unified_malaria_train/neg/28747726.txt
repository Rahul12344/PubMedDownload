drastic changes gene expression occur adult female mosquitoes take a
blood meal use nutrients egg maturation. growing body evidence
indicates micrornas (mirnas) contribute tightly controlled tissue-
and stage-specific gene expression. investigate role mirnas, we
monitored mirna expression mosquito anopheles gambiae 72-h
period immediately blood feeding. also measured association of
mirnas argonaute 1 (ago1) argonaute 2 (ago2) assess functional
status individual mirna species. overall, 173 mature mirnas precipitated 
with ago1 ago2, including 12 new mirnas, orthologs found
thus far anopheles species. ago1 predominant carrier of
mirnas anopheles gambiae. abundance ago loading mature 
mirnas relatively stable blood ingestion. however, mirnas the
mir-309/286/2944 cluster considerably upregulated blood feeding.
injection specific antagomir mir-309 resulted smaller developing
oocytes ultimately fewer eggs. addition, ago association some
mirnas proportional cellular abundance, suggesting that
integration mirnas ago complexes regulated additional
mechanisms.
