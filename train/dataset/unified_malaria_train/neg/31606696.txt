artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) offers highly successful treatment of
malaria. emergence spread plasmodium falciparum (pf) parasites with
decreased susceptibility act south-east asia caused concern worldwide. 
the current accepted criteria assess artemisinin (art) resistance relies upon 
data treatment failure, delayed parasite clearance day 3 (dpc3), parasite
clearance half-life (pchl) in-vitro/ex-vivo ring stage survival assays
(rsas). interestingly, studies suggest dpc3 provide distinct
separation art sensitive/resistant strains, rsa differences may also 
be inconclusive. recently, recrudescence art treated pf, independent of
the presence kelch 13 (k13) mutation (c580y), reported monkey 
malaria model suggesting genes k13 like coronin, dhps, dhfr, crt,
mdr1 plasmepsin1 may contribute towards act failure. collated
the distribution k13 mutants pf strains south asia. total fifty
pf-k13 mutations studied art resistance south asia nine
have validated eleven potentials art resistance. remaining
thirty k13 mutations reported various locations south asia 
lack corroborative clinical data art resistance/act failure. fifty,
fourteen k13 mutations identified india including four novel
mutations (s549y, g625r, n657h, d702n). structural mapping k13 mutations
does offer coherent explanation contribution towards art
resistance scattered k13 structure. thus, k13 mutations likely
provide partial synopsis, propose suspect cases act
failure assessed by: 1) dpc3, 2) pchl, 3) in-vitro/ex-vivo rsas 4) gwas
data effort annotate resistance status parasites. these
efforts may help surveillance containment art resistance/act failure in
south asia.
