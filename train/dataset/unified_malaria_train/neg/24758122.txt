disease screening three breeding populations adult exhibition budgerigars
(melopsittacus undulatus) new zealand reveals high prevalence novel
polyomavirus avian malaria infection.

disease surveillance vital management new zealand's endemic and
threatened avian species. three infectious agents potential threats to
new zealand's endemic birds include avian polyomavirus (apv), beak feather
disease virus (bfdv), avian malaria. three agents reported in
new zealand; however, possible reservoir populations identified. in
this communication, report first study apv, bfdv, avian malaria 
introduced adult exhibition budgerigars (melopsittacus undulatus) new zealand.
blood samples collected 90 living adult budgerigars three breeding
locations north island new zealand. overall apv prevalence 22%
was determined using broad-spectrum nested pcr amplified major capsid 
protein vp1 gene polyomavirus. phylogenetic analysis vp1 gene revealed 
a unique isolate apv, sequence divergence 32% previously
reported budgerigar fledgling disease strains 33% recently reported
new zealand finch isolate. budgerigars sampled found pcr
negative bfdv, overall prevalence 30% detected pcr avian
malaria. sequencing revealed presence ubiquitous malarial strains also
the potentially destructive plasmodium relictum strain. results study
suggest apv avian malaria present new zealand adult
budgerigars, study highlights need studies determine
whether pathogens captive bird populations may threat spill over
into new zealand's endemic threatened avifauna whether prevention and
control methods need implemented.
