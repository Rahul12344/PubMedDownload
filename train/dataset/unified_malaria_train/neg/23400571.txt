high levels genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum populations an
obstacle malaria control. here, investigate relationship local 
variation malaria epidemiology parasite genetic diversity papua new
guinea (png). cross-sectional malaria surveys performed 14 villages
spanning four distinct malaria-endemic areas north coast, including one
area sampled dry season. high-resolution msp2 genotyping of
2,147 blood samples identified 761 p. falciparum infections containing total of
1,392 clones whose genotypes used measure genetic diversity. considerable
variability infection prevalence mean multiplicity infection was
observed study sites, area sampled dry season
showing particularly striking local variability. genetic diversity strongly
associated multiplicity infection infection prevalence. in
highly endemic areas, differences infection prevalence may translate 
a decrease parasite population diversity.
