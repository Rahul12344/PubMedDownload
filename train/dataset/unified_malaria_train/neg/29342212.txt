parasite virulence, important factor contributing severity of
plasmodium falciparum infection, varies among p. falciparum strains. relatively
little known regarding markers virulence capable identifying strains
responsible severe malaria. investigated effects genetic variations
in p.f. merozoite surface protein 2 gene (msp2) virulence, was
previously postulated factor. analyzed 300 msp2 sequences single p.
falciparum clone infection patients uncomplicated disease well as
those admitted severe malaria without cerebral disease. the
association msp2 variations disease severity examined. found 
the n allele codon 8 block 2 fc27-like msp2 gene significantly
associated severe disease without cerebral complications (odds ratio = 2.73,
p = 0.039), k allele codon 17 block 4 3d7-like msp2 gene
was associated cerebral malaria (odds ratio = 3.52, p = 0.024). data
suggests possible roles associated alleles parasite invasion processes
and immune-mediated pathogenicity. multiplicity infection found to
associate severe disease without cerebral complications, cerebral
malaria. variations msp2-fc27-block 2-8n 3d7-block 4-17k allele appear
to parasite virulence markers, may useful determining likelihood
for severe cerebral malaria. interactions potential host factors
for severe diseases also explored.
