malaria parasite transmission humans initiated inoculation of
plasmodium sporozoites skin mosquitoes. sporozoites develop within
mosquito midgut oocysts, first invade salivary glands mosquitoes, and
finally infect hepatocytes mammals. apical structure sporozoites is
conserved infective forms apicomplexan parasites have
secretory organelles, rhoptries micronemes. rhoptry
proteins crucial plasmodium merozoite infection erythrocytes, we
examined roles rhoptry proteins sporozoites. here, demonstrate 
rhoptry neck protein 2 (ron2) also localized rhoptries sporozoites. to
elucidate ron2 function sporozoites, applied promoter swapping strategy
to restrict ron2 transcription intraerythrocytic stage rodent
malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei. ron2 knockdown sporozoites severely
impaired ability invade salivary glands, via decreasing the
attachment capacity substrate. first rhoptry protein
demonstrated involved salivary gland invasion. addition, ron2
knockdown sporozoites showed less infectivity hepatocytes, possibly due to
decreased attachment/gliding ability, indicating parts parasite
invasion machinery conserved, contribution might differ among
infective forms. sporozoite stage-specific knockdown system help to
facilitate understanding comprehensive molecular mechanisms parasite
invasion target cells.
