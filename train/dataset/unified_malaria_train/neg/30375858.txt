malaria one challenging human infectious diseases, both
prevention control hindered development plasmodium
falciparum resistance existing therapies. several new compounds novel
mechanisms clinical development treatment malaria, including
dsm265, inhibitor plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. explore the
mechanisms resistance might develop dsm265 field, selected 
for dsm265-resistant p. falciparum parasites vitro. five different
amino acid changes led reduced efficacy parasite decreased
dsm265 binding p. falciparum dhodh. dsm265-resistant parasites retained
full sensitivity atovaquone. one observed mutations the
dsm265 binding site, remaining c276f adjacent flavin cofactor 
site. c276f mutation previously identified recrudescent parasite
during phase iia clinical study. confirmed mutation (and the
related c276y) accounted full level observed dsm265 resistance by
regenerating mutation using crispr/cas9 genome editing. x-ray structure
analysis c276f mutant enzyme showed conformational changes nearby 
residues required accommodate larger f276 residue, turn led 
to restriction size dsm265 binding pocket. findings
underscore importance developing dsm265 part combination therapy
with agents successful use malaria.
