background: peruvian amazon, plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax
malaria endemic rural areas, microscopy available. malaria
rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) provide quick accurate diagnosis. however,
pfhrp2 gene deletions may limit use histidine-rich protein-2 (pfhrp2)
detecting rdts. further, cross-reactions p. falciparum p. vivax-specific 
test lines vice versa may impair diagnostic specificity.
methods: thirteen rdt products evaluated 179 prospectively collected
malaria positive samples. species diagnosis performed microscopy and
confirmed pcr. pfhrp2 gene deletions assessed pcr.
results: sensitivity p. falciparum diagnosis lower pfhrp2 compared to
p. falciparum-specific plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pf-pldh)-detecting rdts 
(71.6% vs. 98.7%, p<0.001). (19/21) false negative pfhrp2 results were
associated pfhrp2 gene deletions (25.7% 74 p. falciparum samples).
diagnostic sensitivity p. vivax (101 samples) excellent, except two
products. 10/12 p. vivax-detecting rdt products, cross-reactions the
pfhrp2 pf-pldh line occurred median frequency 2.5% (range 0%-10.9%) of
p. vivax samples assessed. two rdt products, two one p. falciparum samples
respectively cross-reacted pv-pldh line. two pf-pldh/pan-pldh-detecting 
rdts showed excellent sensitivity (1.0%) cross-reactions showed
faint pf-pldh lines 24.7% 38.9% p. falciparum samples.
conclusion: pfhrp2-detecting rdts suitable peruvian amazon due 
pfhrp2 gene deletions. two pf-pldh-detecting rdts performed excellently are
promising rdts region although faint test lines concern.
