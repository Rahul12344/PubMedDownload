protozoan parasites profoundly affect mankind represent exceptionally
diverse group organisms, including plasmodium, toxoplasma, entamoeba, giardia,
trypanosomes, leishmania. despite overwhelming impact parasites,
there remain many aspects discovered mechanisms pathogenesis and
how organisms survive host. combined ever-increasing
availability sequenced genomes, rna interference (rnai), discovered mere 13 
years ago, enormously facilitated analysis gene function, especially
in organisms amenable classical genetic approaches. we
review current status rnai studies parasitic protozoa, special 
emphasis use postgenomic tool.
