this article outlines genome-scale approaches used identify
mutations malaria (plasmodium) parasites underlie drug resistance and
contribute treatment failure. approaches include genetic mapping by
linkage genome-wide association studies, drug selection characterization
of resistant mutants, identification genome regions strong
recent selection. genomic approaches identify candidate
resistance loci, genetic manipulation needed demonstrate causality. we
therefore also describe growing arsenal available transfection approaches 
for direct incrimination mutations suspected play role resistance. our
intention review past progress highlight promising approaches 
future investigations.
