due presence lake quarun particular nature its
irrigation system, speculated fayum, large depression 80
kilometers south-west modern cairo, exposed hazards malaria in
historic times. similarly, speculated that, area, also
human tuberculosis might far widespread antiquity in
its recent past. hypotheses confirmed, would imply frequent
cases co-infection two pathogens might occurred ancient
populations. substantiate speculations, molecular analyses carried 
out sixteen mummified heads recovered necropolis abusir el meleq
(fayum) dating 3(rd) intermediate period (1064-656 bc) roman
period (30 bc-300 ad). soft tissue biopsies used dna extractions pcr
amplifications using well-suited protocols. partial 196-bp fragment of
plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 gene 123-bp fragment the
mycobacterium tuberculosis complex insertion sequence is6110 amplified and
sequenced six five sixteen specimens, respectively. 100%
concordance rates sequences p. falciparum m.
tuberculosis complex ones obtained. lastly, concomitant pcr amplification of
p. falciparum m. tuberculosis complex dna specific fragments obtained 
four mummies, three (14)c dated late graeco-roman
periods. data confirm hydrography fayum extremely conducive
to spread malaria. also support notion agricultural boom
and dense crowding occurred region, especially ptolemies,
highly increased probability manifestation spread of
tuberculosis. extend back-wards ca. 800 bc new evidence malaria
tropica human tuberculosis co-occurrence ancient lower egypt.
