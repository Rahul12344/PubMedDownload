the genomes plasmodium parasites cause malaria humans, primates,
birds, rodents encode multiple 6-cys proteins. distinct 6-cys protein
family members reside surface extracellular life cycle stage and
those surface liver infective sexual stages shown play
important roles hepatocyte growth fertilization respectively. however,
6-cys proteins associated blood-stage forms parasite no
known function. investigate biochemical nature function two
blood-stage 6-cys proteins plasmodium falciparum, pathogenic species 
to afflict humans. show native p12 p41 form stable heterodimer on
the infective merozoite surface secreted following invasion, could
find evidence complex mediates erythrocyte-receptor binding. that
p12 p41 appear major role adhesins erythrocyte
receptors supported observation antisera proteins did
not substantially inhibit erythrocyte invasion. investigate functional
roles proteins genes successfully disrupted p.
falciparum, however p12 p41 knockout parasites grew normal rates vitro 
and displayed obvious phenotypic changes. appears likely that
these blood-stage 6-cys proteins operate pair play redundant roles
either erythrocyte invasion host-immune interactions.
