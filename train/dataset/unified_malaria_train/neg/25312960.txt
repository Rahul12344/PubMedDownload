infectivity. here, report balb/cbyj mice susceptible to
plasmodium yoelii preerythrocytic infection balb/cj mice. difference
occurs level early hepatocyte infection, expression levels of
reported host factors involved infection correlate with
susceptibility. interestingly, balb/cbyj hepatocytes frequently
polyploid; thus, susceptibility converges previously observed
preference sporozoites infect polyploid hepatocytes. gene expression
analysis demonstrates hepatocyte-specific differences mrna abundance for
numerous genes balb/cbyj balb/cj mice, encode
hepatocyte surface molecules. data suggest yet-unknown receptor 
sporozoite infection, present elevated levels balb/cbyj hepatocytes and
also polyploid hepatocytes, might facilitate plasmodium liver infection.
