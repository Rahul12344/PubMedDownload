malaria infection induces complex diverse immune responses. elucidate 
mechanisms underlying host-parasite interaction, performed genetic screen
during early (24 h) plasmodium yoelii infection mice identified large
number interacting host parasite genes/loci transspecies expression 
quantitative trait locus (ts-eqtl) analysis. next investigated host e3
ubiquitin ligase gene (march1) clustered interferon
(ifn)-stimulated genes (isgs) based similarity genome-wide pattern 
of logarithm odds (lod) scores (gpls). march1 inhibits
mavs/sting/trif-induced type ifn (ifn-i) signaling vitro vivo.
however, malaria-infected hosts, deficiency march1 reduces ifn-i production
by activating inhibitors socs1, usp18, trim24 altering immune 
cell populations. march1 deficiency increases cd86+dc (dendritic cell)
populations levels ifn-γ interleukin 10 (il-10) day 4 post
infection, leading improved host survival. cell depletion reduces ifn-γ
level reverse protective effects march1 deficiency, also 
achieved antibody neutralization ifn-γ. study reveals functions of
march1 (membrane-associated ring-ch-type finger 1) innate immune responses and
provides potential avenues activating antimalaria immunity enhancing
vaccine efficacy.
