background: inflammation monocytes thought important human
malaria pathogenesis. however, relationship inflammation various
monocyte functions acute malaria, recovery acute malaria, and
asymptomatic parasitemia endemic populations poorly understood.
methods: evaluated plasma cytokine levels, monocyte subsets, monocyte
functional responses, monocyte inflammatory transcriptional profiles 1- to
10-year-old kenyan children time presentation acute uncomplicated 
malaria recovery 6 weeks later; results compared analogous
data asymptomatic children adults community.
results: acute malaria marked elevated levels proinflammatory and
regulatory cytokines expansion inflammatory "intermediate" monocyte
subset returned levels healthy asymptomatic children 6 weeks later.
monocytes displayed activated phenotypes acute malaria, changes in
surface expression markers important innate adaptive immunity.
functionally, acute malaria monocytes monocytes asymptomatic infected
children impaired phagocytosis p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes
relative asymptomatic children blood-stage infection. monocytes from
both acute malaria recovery time points displayed strong equivalent
cytokine responsiveness innate immune agonists independent of
infection status. monocyte transcriptional profiles revealed regulated and
balanced proinflammatory antiinflammatory altered phagocytosis gene
expression patterns distinct malaria-naive monocytes.
conclusion: observations provide insights monocyte functions the
innate immune response uncomplicated malaria suggest asymptomatic
parasitemia children clinically benign.
