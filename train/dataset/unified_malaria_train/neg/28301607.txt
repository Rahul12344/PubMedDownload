successful optimization plant-derived compounds control nuisance
insects would benefit scientifically validated targets. however, close
association genotypic responses physiological toxicity effects
mediated compounds remains underexplored. study, evaluated
the sublethal dose effects proanthocyanidins (pas) sourced green tea

mosquitoes aim unravel probable molecular targets. based the
induced phenotypic effects, genes selected study targeted juvenile hormone
(jh) biosynthesis, signal transduction, oxidative stress response xenobiotic 
detoxification addition vitellogenesis females. findings suggest
that chronic exposure larval stages (l3/l4) sublethal dose 5 ppm
dramatically extended larval developmental period 12 days, slowed 
pupation rates, induced abnormal larval-pupal intermediates caused 100%
inhibition adult emergence. further, females exhibited significant
interference fecundity egg hatchability relative controls (p < 0.001). 
using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr), our
findings show pa-treated larvae exhibited significant repression of
agamjhamt (p < 0.001), agamilp1 (p < 0.001) agamcyp6m2 (p < 0.001) with
up-regulation hsp70 (p < 0.001). females exposed larvae demonstrated
down-regulation agamvg (p = 0.03), agamilp1 (p = 0.009), agamcyp6m2 (p = 0.05)
and agamjhamt (p = 0.02). findings support c. sinensis proanthocyanidins
affect important vectorial capacity components mosquito survival rates
and reproductive fitness thus could potentially used controlling
populations malaria vectors.
