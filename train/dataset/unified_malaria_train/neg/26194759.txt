pathogens vary antigenic complexity. pathogens as
measles present relatively invariant targets immune system, others
such malaria display considerable antigenic diversity. immune response
copes presence multiple antigens, whether trade-off exists
between breadth efficacy antibody (ab)-mediated immune responses, 
unsolved problems. present theoretical model affinity maturation of
b-cell receptors (bcrs) primary infection examine variation in
the number accessible antigenic sites alters ab repertoire. naive b cells 
with randomly generated receptor sequences initiate germinal centre (gc)
reaction. binding affinity bcr antigen quantified via a
genotype-phenotype map, based random energy landscape, combines local
and distant interactions residues. presence numerous antigens
or epitopes, b-cell clones different specificities compete stimulation
during rounds mutation within gcs. find availability many
epitopes reduces affinity relative breadth ab repertoire. despite 
the stochasticity somatic hypermutation, patterns immunodominance are
strongly shaped chance selection naive b cells specificities for
particular epitopes. model provides mechanistic basis diversity 
ab repertoires evolutionary advantage antigenically complex pathogens.
