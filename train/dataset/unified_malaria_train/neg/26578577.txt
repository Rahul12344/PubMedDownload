in eukaryotes, chromatin architecture pivotal role regulating all
dna-associated processes central control gene expression. for
plasmodium falciparum, causative agent human malaria, nucleosome
positioning profile regulatory regions deserves particular attention because
of extreme at-content. aid highly controlled mnase-seq
procedure reveal positioning nucleosomes provides structural and
regulatory framework transcriptional unit demarcating landmark sites
(transcription/translation start end sites). addition, analysis
provides strong indications function positioned nucleosomes splice 
site recognition. transcription start sites (tsss) bordered small
nucleosome-depleted region, lack stereotypic downstream nucleosome
arrays, highlighting key difference chromatin organization compared model
organisms. furthermore, observe transcription-coupled eviction nucleosomes 
on strong tsss intraerythrocytic development demonstrate that
nucleosome positioning dynamics predictive functionality of
regulatory dna elements. collectively, strong nucleosome positioning over
splice sites surrounding putative transcription factor binding sites
highlights regulatory capacity nucleosome landscape deadly
human pathogen.
