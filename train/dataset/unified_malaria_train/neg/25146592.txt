because relative prevalence hereditary sickle cell disease the
auxiliary role sickle cell gene reducing mortality malaria, it
is believed p. falciparum exerted selection pressure human
populations increase prevalence otherwise detrimental gene. a
model incorporating three genotypes two age cohorts used test the
hypothesis higher death rates due malaria exert selective pressure to
increase prevalence sickle cell gene. model displays selection
pressure carrier gene presence increasing malaria death rates
for either adults children, showing higher final frequencies gene 
as well shortened time reach frequencies.
