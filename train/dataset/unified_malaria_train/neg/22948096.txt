changes population allele frequencies may driven several forces,
including selection drift, revealed sampling many
generations. studies, however, rare protist parasites.
microsatellite allele frequencies 4 loci followed population of
plasmodium mexicanum, malaria parasite lizards california usa 1 site
from 1978 2010. rapid turnover lizards indicates parasite was
studied minimum 33 transmission cycles possibly twice number.
sample sizes ranged 841 956 scored parasite clones per locus. dna was
extracted frozen dried blood blood removed stained blood smears
from earliest years, verification study demonstrated dna blood
smears provided valid genetic data. parasite prevalence effective population 
size (ne) dropped 2000, remaining lower next decade. 2 loci,
allele frequencies appeared stable first 2 decades study, but
changed rapidly decline prevalence. allele frequencies changed 
more gradually 2 loci. genetic drift could account changes in
allele frequencies, especially drop prevalence ne, force
of selection could also driven observed patterns.
