the asian tiger mosquito (aedes albopictus) important vector pathogens 
that affect human health, including viruses cause dengue chikungunya
fevers. also one world's fastest-spreading invasive species. for
these reasons, crucial identify strategies controlling the
reproduction spread mosquito. mating, seminal fluid proteins
(sfps) transferred male mosquitoes females, sfps modulate
female behavior physiology ways influence reproduction. despite the
importance sfps female reproductive behavior mosquitoes other
insects, identity sfps ae. albopictus previously reported.
we used transcriptomics proteomics identify 198 sfps ae. albopictus. we
discuss possible functions sfps relation ae. albopictus
reproduction-related biology. additionally compare sequences sfps
with proteins (including reported sfps) several species, including ae.
aegypti. 72 (36.4%) ae. albopictus sfps putative orthologs 
ae. aegypti, suggesting low conservation complement sfps these
species, find evidence elevated rate evolution positive
selection sfps shared two aedes species, suggesting
high sequence conservation shared sfps. results provide foundation
for future studies investigate roles individual sfps feeding and
reproduction mosquito. functional analysis sfps could inform
strategies managing rate pathogen transmission ae. albopictus.
