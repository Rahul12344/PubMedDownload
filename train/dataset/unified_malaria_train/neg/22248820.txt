one approach develop malaria blood-stage vaccine target proteins 
play critical roles erythrocyte invasion merozoites. merozoite
surface proteins (msps) erythrocyte-binding antigens (ebas) are
considered promising vaccine candidates, known play important
roles erythrocyte invasion exposed host immune system. we
focused plasmodium falciparum antigen, pfmspdbl1 (encoded pf10_0348 gene)
that member msp3 family duffy binding-like (dbl) domain 
and secreted polymorphic antigen associated merozoites (spam) domain.
therefore, aimed characterize pfmspdbl1 vaccine candidate. recombinant
full-length protein (rfl) pfmspdbl1 synthesized wheat germ cell-free 
system, rabbit antiserum raised rfl. show rabbit
anti-pfmspdbl1 antibodies inhibited erythrocyte invasion wild type parasites
in vitro dose dependent manner, specificity inhibitory activity
was confirmed using pfmspdbl1 knockout parasites. pre-incubation the
anti-pfmspdbl1 antibodies recombinant spam domain effect the
inhibitory activity suggesting antibodies region involved. 
in addition, antibodies rfl elicited p. falciparum infection in
malaria endemic area, suggesting pfmsldbl1 immunogenic humans. our
results suggest pfmspdbl1 novel blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate.
