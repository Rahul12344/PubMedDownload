hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) known reside bone marrow (bm) niche, 
which associated relatively higher calcium content. hscs sense and
respond calcium changes. however, calcium-sensing components modulate hsc 
function expansion largely unknown. investigated temporal modulation of
calcium sensing ca2+ homeostasis ex vivo hsc culture vivo.
murine bm-hscs, human bm, umbilical cord blood (ucb) mononuclear cells (mncs)
were treated store-operated calcium entry (soce) inhibitors skf 96365
hydrochloride (abbreviated skf) 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-apb).
besides, k+ channel inhibitor tea chloride (abbreviated tea) used to
compare relationship calcium-activated potassium channel activities. 
seven days skf treatment induced mouse human ex vivo bm-hsc expansion as
well ucb-derived primitive hsc expansion. skf treatment induced surface
expression casr, cxcr4, adhesion molecules human hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells. hscs expanded skf successfully differentiated blood
lineages recipient animals demonstrated higher repopulation capability. 
furthermore, modulation soce bm-induced hsc content differentially 
altered niche-related gene expression profile vivo. intriguingly, treatments
with soce inhibitors skf 2-apb boosted mouse bm mesenchymal stem cell
(msc) human adipose-derived mscs proliferation, whereas affect
the endothelial cell proliferation. findings suggest temporal
modulation calcium sensing crucial expansion maintenance murine
hscs, human hscs, mouse bm-mscs function.
