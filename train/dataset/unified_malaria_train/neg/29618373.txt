background: malaria mortality rates sub-saharan africa declined
significantly recent years result increased insecticide-treated bed
net (itn) usage. major challenge progress emergence and
spread insecticide resistance alleles anopheles mosquito vectors, like 
an. coluzzii. non-synonymous mutation para voltage-gated sodium channel 
gene reduces pyrethroid-binding affinity, resulting knockdown resistance
(kdr). metabolic mechanisms insecticide resistance involving detoxification
genes like cytochrome p450 genes, carboxylesterases, glutathione
s-transferases also important. gene activity tissue-specific
and/or environmentally induced, gene regulatory variation may overlooked 
comparing expression whole mosquito bodies standard rearing
conditions.
results: detected complex insecticide resistance 2014 an. coluzzii colony
from southern mali using bottle bioassays. additional bioassays involving
recombinant genotypes cross relatively susceptible 1995 an.
coluzzii colony mali confirmed importance kdr associated
increased permethrin resistance cyp9k1 locus x chromosome.
significant differential expression cyp9k1 observed among these
colonies malpighian tubules. however, p450 gene cyp6z1 overexpressed
in resistant individuals following sublethal permethrin exposure the
carboxylesterase gene coeae5g constitutively overexpressed.
conclusions: significant p450-related insecticide resistance observed 
2014 an. coluzzii colony indicates itns treated p450 inhibitor
piperonyl butoxide (pbo) would effective region. known
insecticide resistance gene cyp6z1 differentially expressed exclusively in
the context sublethal permethrin exposure, highlighting importance of
tissue-specificity environmental conditions gene expression studies. the
increased activity carboxylesterase coeae5g resistant an. coluzzii 
colony suggests resistance insecticides like organophosphates.
additional gene expression studies involving tissues (e.g. fat body) would 
provide comprehensive view genes underlying metabolic insecticide
resistance an. coluzzii mali. identifying genetic markers linked these
regulatory alleles important next step would substantially improve
insecticide resistance surveillance population genetic studies this
important vector species.
