background: genetic polymorphisms cytochrome p450 2b6 (cyp2b6) gene could 
influence therapeutic outcomes cyp2b6-metabolized drugs artemisinin,
nevirapine (nvp), efavirenz (efv). main objective present study
was analyze frequency common allele cyp2b6*1 *7 *9
in iranian baluchi population also compare frequencies these
polymorphisms reported different ethnic groups.
methods: total 206 healthy, unrelated, subjects participated this
study. cyp2b6*1, *2, *3, *4, *5, *6,*7, *9 polymorphisms investigated,
using pcr-rflp followed sequencing analysis.
results: high frequency 516t (35.7%) found among studied subjects.
also, three frequent genotypes cyp2b6*1/*6 (28.1%), cyp2b6*1/*1
(16%) cyp2b6*1/*9 (14.6%). frequency cyp2b6*6/*6 (4.8%) not
different caucasian, japanese chinese populations, lower than
west african (17%) papua new guinean (43%) populations.
conclusion: allele frequencies cyp2b6 examined population were
markedly different african, caucasian, southeast asian
populations. cyp2b6*2, *4, *5, *6, *7 found iranian baluchi 
may affect response artemisin derivatives. high frequency g516t
(35.7%) detected among examined subjects might cause greater
efavirenz plasma exposure central nervous system side effects.
therefore, characterization pharmacologically relevant polymorphisms cyp2b6
has great potential improve drug efficacy reduce toxicity.
