background: micrornas (mirnas) small non-coding rnas widely identified in
many mosquitoes. reported play important roles development,
differentiation innate immunity. however, mirnas anopheles sinensis, one
of chinese malaria mosquitoes, remain largely unknown.
methods: investigated global mirna expression profile an. sinensis
using illumina hiseq 2000 sequencing. meanwhile, applied bioinformatic
approach identify potential mirnas an. sinensis. identified mirna
profiles compared analyzed two approaches. selected mirnas from
the sequencing result bioinformatic approach confirmed qrt-pcr.
moreover, target prediction, go annotation pathway analysis carried 
to understand role mirnas an. sinensis.
results: identified 49 conserved mirnas 12 novel mirnas next-generation
high-throughput sequencing technology. contrast, 43 mirnas predicted by
the bioinformatic approach, two assigned novel. comparative
analysis mirna profiles two approaches showed 21 mirnas shared
between them. twelve novel mirnas match known mirnas organism,
indicating possibly species-specific. forty mirnas found in
many mosquito species, indicating mirnas evolutionally conserved
and may critical roles process life. selected known and
novel mirnas (asi-mir-281, asi-mir-184, asi-mir-14, asi-mir-nov5, asi-mir-nov4,
asi-mir-9383, asi-mir-2a) could detected quantitative real-time pcr
(qrt-pcr) sequenced sample, expression patterns mirnas
measured qrt-pcr concordance original mirna sequencing data. 
the predicted targets known novel mirnas covered many important
biological roles pathways indicating diversity mirna functions. we
also found 21 conserved mirnas eight counterparts target immune pathway
genes an. sinensis based analysis an. gambiae.
conclusions: results provide first lead elucidation mirna
profile an. sinensis. unveiling roles mosquito mirnas undoubtedly 
lead better understanding mosquito biology mosquito-pathogen
interactions. work lays foundation functional study of
an. sinensis mirnas facilitate application vector control.
