recently, heterologously expressed, purified, analyzed function the
sole plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), found the
enzyme "class iii" "vps34" pi3k, found irreversibly
inhibited fe2+-mediated covalent, nonspecific interactions leading
antimalarial drug, dihydroartemisinin [hassett, m. r., et al. (2017) biochemistry
56, 4335-4345]. one several p. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases
[putative iiiβ isoform (pfpi4kiiiβ)] generated similar interest a
druggable target; however, validation mechanism action putative 
pfpi4k inhibitors yet possible due lack purified pfpi4kiiiβ.
we therefore codon optimized pfpi4kiiiβ gene, successfully expressed the
protein yeast, purified n-lobe catalytic domain pfpi4kiiiβ protein.
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay strategy previously perfected for
analysis pfpi3k (pfvps34), measured apparent initial rate, km,app(atp),
and enzyme characteristics found full activity construct and
that pfpi4kiiiβ activity consistent class iiiβ designation.
because several novel antimalarial drug candidates different chemical
scaffolds proposed target pfpi4kiiiβ, titrated enzyme inhibition 
for candidates versus purified pfpi4kiiiβ pfvps34. also analyzed the
activity versus purified pfpi4kiiiβ mutants previously expressed p. falciparum
selected resistance drugs. interestingly, found putative
pfpi4kiiiβ inhibitor currently advanced trials (mmv390048; mmv '0048) a
potent inhibitor pfvps34 pfpi4kiiiβ. data helpful for
further preclinical optimization exciting new class p. falciparum pi
kinase inhibitor ("pfpiki") antimalarial drugs.
