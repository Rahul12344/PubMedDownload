we describe case paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) woman is
heterozygous glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase a-   ( g6pda-) allele. pnh
is associated one clones cells lack complement inhibition
due loss function somatic mutations piga gene.  piga encodes the
enzyme phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class a, catalyses 
the first step glycosylphosphatidylinisotol ( gpi)  anchor synthesis. two gpi 
anchored red cell surface antigens regulate complement lysis. g6pd catalyses 
first step pentose phosphate pathway enzyme variants, frequent some
populations selected confer resistance malaria, are
associated hemolysis presence oxidizing agents including several
drugs. patient suffered hemolytic attack taking co-trimoxazole, a
drug precipitates hemolysis g6pd deficient individuals. since g6pd
and piga x-linked hypothesized piga mutation the
x-chromosome carrying g6pda- allele. investigations showed fact the
piga mutation x-chromosome carrying normal g6pd b allele. we
speculate complement activation g6pd a- red cells exposed bactrim
might triggered complement activation inducing lysis g6pd b pnh type 
ii red blood cells patient may pnh clone expressing g6pda-
