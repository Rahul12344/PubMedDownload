understanding mechanisms drug resistance plasmodium vivax, parasite
that causes widespread form human malaria, complicated lack
of suitable long-term cell culture system parasite. contrast p. 
falciparum, readily manipulated laboratory, insights
about parasite biology need inferred human studies. analyze
the genomes parasites within 10 human p. vivax infections peruvian
amazon. using next-generation sequencing show p. vivax infections
analyzed region likely polyclonal. despite polyclonality we
observe limited parasite genetic diversity showing three fewer
haplotypes comprise 94% examined genomes, suggesting recent
introduction parasites geographic region. contrast find more
than three haplotypes putative drug-resistance genes, including gene
encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase p. vivax multidrug 
resistance associated transporter, suggesting resistance mutations have
arisen independently. additionally, several drug-resistance genes located 
genomic regions evidence increased copy number. data suggest that
whole genome sequencing malaria parasites patients may provide more
insight evolution drug resistance genetic linkage or
association studies, especially geographical regions limited parasite
genetic diversity.
