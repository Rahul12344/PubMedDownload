plasmodium relies numerous agonists journey mosquito
vector, agonists represent potent targets transmission-blocking 
either inhibiting interfering pre- post-transcriptionally. the
recently developed crispr/cas9-based genome editing tools anopheles
mosquitoes provide new promising opportunities study agonist
function developing malaria control strategies gene deletion to
achieve complete agonist inactivation. established modified
crispr/cas9 gene editing procedure malaria vector anopheles gambiae, 
studied effect inactivating fibrinogen-related protein 1 (frep1) gene 
on mosquito's susceptibility plasmodium mosquito fitness. frep1
knockout mutants developed adult mosquitoes showed profound suppression
of infection human rodent malaria parasites oocyst and
sporozoite stages. frep1 inactivation, however, resulted fitness costs
including significantly lower blood-feeding propensity, fecundity egg
hatching rate, retarded pupation time, reduced longevity blood
meal.
