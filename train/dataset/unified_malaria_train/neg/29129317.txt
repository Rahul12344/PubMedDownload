from eighth century onward, indian ocean scene extensive trade
of sub-saharan african slaves via sea routes controlled muslim arab and
swahili traders. several populations present-day pakistan india are
thought descendants slaves, yet history admixture 
natural selection remains largely undefined. here, studied genome-wide
diversity african-descent makranis, reside arabian sea coast of
pakistan, well four neighboring pakistani populations, investigate 
the genetic legacy, population dynamics, tempo indian ocean slave
trade. show makranis result admixture event between
local baluch tribes bantu-speaking populations eastern southeastern
africa; dated event ∼300 years ago omani empire domination.
levels parental relatedness, measured runs homozygosity, found
to similar across pakistani populations, suggesting makranis rapidly 
adopted traditional practice endogamous marriages. finally, searched
for signatures post-admixture selection traits evolving positive
selection, including skin color, lactase persistence, resistance malaria. 
we demonstrate african-specific duffy-null blood group-believed to
confer resistance plasmodium vivax infection-was recently introduced to
pakistan slave trade evolved adaptively p. vivax
malaria-endemic region. study reconstructs genetic adaptive history
of neglected episode african diaspora illustrates impact of
recent admixture diffusion adaptive traits across human populations.
