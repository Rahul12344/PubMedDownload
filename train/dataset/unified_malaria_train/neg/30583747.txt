background: mosquito-borne diseases, malaria, controlled primarily by
suppressing mosquito vector populations using insecticides. current control
programmes seriously threatened emergence rapid spread of
resistance approved insecticides. genetic approaches proposed complement
the existing control efforts may sustainable solution mosquito
control. approaches would rely releases modified male mosquitoes, 
because released females would contribute biting pathogen transmission.
however, sufficiently large-scale methods sex separation mosquitoes
exist.
results: exploited female embryo-killing property sex
determining gene yob african malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, to
evaluate feasibility creating transgenic an. gambiae sexing strains a
male-only phenotype. generated an. gambiae lines yob expression, 
sexes, controlled vas2 promoter. penetrance female-lethal phenotype
was highly dependent location transgenic construct within the
genome. strong male bias observed one lines. females that
survived adulthood line possessed masculinized head appendages and
terminal abdominal segments. feed blood, lacked host-seeking
behavior, thus effectively sterile. males, however, affected by
yob overexpression.
conclusions: study demonstrates ectopic expression yob results a
recovery viable, fertile males, death, otherwise strongly
deleterious effects, females. result shows potential generation of
transgenic sexing strains anopheles gambiae conditional male-only
phenotype.
