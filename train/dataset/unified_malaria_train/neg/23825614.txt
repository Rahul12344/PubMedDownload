analysis plasmodium falciparum genome reveals limited number putative
autophagy genes, specifically four genes involved atg8 lipidation, an
essential step formation autophagosomes. yeast, atg8 lipidation requires
the e1-type ligase atg7, e2-type ligase atg3, cysteine protease atg4.
these four putative p. falciparum atg (pfatg) genes transcribed the
parasite's erythrocytic stages. pfatg7 relatively low identity similarity
to yeast atg7 (14.7% 32.2%, respectively), due primarily long insertions
typical p. falciparum. excluding insertions identity similarity
are higher (38.0% 70.8%, respectively). fact key residues
are conserved, including catalytic cysteine atp binding domain, we
hypothesize pfatg7 activating enzyme pfatg8. assess role of
pfatg7 generated two transgenic parasite lines. one, pfatg7 locus 
was modified introduce c-terminal hemagglutinin tag. western blotting
reveals two distinct protein species, one migrating near predicted 150 kda
and one approximately 65 kda. second transgenic line introduces an
inducible degradation domain pfatg7 locus, allowing us rapidly
attenuate pfatg7 protein levels. corresponding species also observed 
parasite line approximately 200 kda 100 kda. upon pfatg7 attenuation
parasites exhibit slow growth phenotype indicating essentiality this
putative enzyme normal growth.
