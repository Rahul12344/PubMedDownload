the obligate intracellular parasites toxoplasma gondii plasmodium spp. invade
host cells injecting protein complex membrane targeted cell 
that bridges two cells assembly ring-like junction. this
circular junction stretches parasites apply traction force pass
through, step typically concurs transient constriction the
parasite body. analyse f-actin dynamics host cell invasion.
super-resolution microscopy real-time imaging highlighted f-actin pool 
the apex pre-invading parasite, f-actin ring junction area during
invasion also networks perinuclear posteriorly localised f-actin.
mutant parasites dysfunctional acto-myosin showed significant decrease of
junctional perinuclear f-actin coincidently affected nuclear
passage junction. propose f-actin machinery eases nuclear
passage stabilising junction pushing nucleus the
constriction. analysis suggests junction opposes resistance the
passage parasite's nucleus provides first evidence dual
contribution actin-forces host cell invasion apicomplexan parasites.
