the mechanisms stage-specific gene regulation malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum largely unclear, small number specific
regulatory transcription factors (ap2 family) identified. in
particular, transcription factors function intraerythrocytic
stage remain elucidated. previously, model case stage-specific
transcription p. falciparum intraerythrocytic stage, analyzed the
transcriptional regulation pf1-cys-prx, trophozoite/schizont-specific gene, 
and suggested nuclear factors bind specifically cis-element of
pf1-cys-prx enhance transcription. present study, purified nuclear 
factors parasite nuclear extract 5 steps chromatography, and
identified factor termed prebp. prebp included ap2 family, is
a novel protein four k-homology (kh) domains. kh domain known be
found rna-binding single-stranded dna-binding proteins. prebp well
conserved plasmodium species partially conserved phylum apicomplexa. to
evaluate effects prebp overexpression, used transient overexpression 
and luciferase assay combined approach. overexpression prebp markedly enhanced
luciferase expression control pf1-cys-prx cis-element. these
results provide first evidence novel transcription factor activates
the gene expression malaria parasite intraerythrocytic stage. these
findings enhance understanding evolution specific transcription
machinery plasmodium eukaryotes.
