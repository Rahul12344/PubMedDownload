understanding spatial scale selection acts upon adaptive genetic
variation natural populations fundamental understanding of
evolutionary ecology, important ramifications conservation. the
environmental factors individuals population exposed vary
at fine spatial scales, potentially generating localized patterns adaptation. 
here, compared patterns neutral major histocompatibility complex (mhc) 
variation within island population berthelot's pipit (anthus berthelotii)
to assess whether landscape-level differences pathogen-mediated selection
generate fine-scale spatial structuring immune genes. specifically, we
tested spatial associations distribution avian malaria, and
the factors previously shown influence distribution, mhc variation
within resident individuals. although found overall genetic structure
across population either neutral mhc loci, find localized
associations environmental factors mhc variation. one mhc class i
allele (anbe48) directly associated malaria infection risk, the
presence anbe48 anbe38 alleles within individuals correlated
(positively negatively, respectively) distance nearest poultry
farm, anthropogenic factor previously shown important determinant 
disease distribution study population. findings highlight the
importance considering small spatial scales studying patterns and
processes involved evolution adaptive loci.
