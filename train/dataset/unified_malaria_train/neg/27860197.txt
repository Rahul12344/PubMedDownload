infectious diseases leading cause death worldwide. novel therapeutics
are urgently required treat multidrug-resistant organisms as
mycobacterium tuberculosis mitigate morbidity mortality caused by
acute infections malaria dengue fever virus well chronic
infections human immunodeficiency virus-1 hepatitis b virus. the
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(crispr)/crispr-associated protein 9 (cas9) system, revolutionized
biomedical research, holds great promise identification validation of
novel drug targets. since discovery adaptive immune system in
prokaryotes, crispr/cas9 system developed multi-faceted
genetic modification tool, used induce gene deletions or
specific gene insertions, conditional alleles endogenous reporters 
virtually organism. generation crispr/cas9 libraries used 
to perform phenotypic whole genome screens provides important new tool that
will aid identification critical host factors involved the
pathogenesis infectious diseases. review, discuss the
development recent applications crispr/cas9 system used identify
novel regulators, might become important fight infectious
diseases.
