introduction: human malaria parasite, plasmodium vivax, proving more
difficult control eliminate plasmodium falciparum areas of
co-transmission. comparisons genetic structure sympatric parasite
populations may provide insight mechanisms underlying resilience 
p. vivax help guide malaria control programs.
methodology/principle findings: p. vivax isolates representing parasite
populations four areas north coast papua new guinea (png) were
genotyped using microsatellite markers compared previously published
microsatellite data sympatric p. falciparum isolates. genetic diversity 
of p. vivax (he = 0.83-0.85) higher p. falciparum (he =
0.64-0.77) four populations. moderate levels genetic differentiation
were found p. falciparum populations, even relatively short
distances (less 50 km), 21-28% private alleles clear geospatial
genetic clustering. conversely, low population differentiation found
between p. vivax catchments, less 5% private alleles genetic
clustering observed. addition, effective population size p. vivax
(30353; 13043-69142) larger p. falciparum (18871; 8109-42986).
conclusions/significance: despite comparably high prevalence, p. vivax higher
diversity panmictic population structure compared sympatric p.
falciparum populations, fragmented subpopulations. results
suggest comparison p. falciparum, p. vivax long-term large
effective population size, consistent intense stable transmission, 
and limited impact past control elimination efforts. underlines
suggestions intensive sustained interventions needed to
control eventually eliminate p. vivax. research clearly demonstrates how
population genetic analyses reveal deeper insight transmission patterns 
than traditional surveillance methods.
