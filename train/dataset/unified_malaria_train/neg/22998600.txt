background: theileria parva tick-borne protozoan parasite, causes east
coast fever, disease cattle sub-saharan africa. like plasmodium
falciparum, parasite undergoes transient diploid life-cycle stage the
gut arthropod vector, involves obligate sexual cycle. assessed
using low-resolution vntr markers, crossover (co) rate t. parva is
relatively high reported vary across different regions the
genome; non-crossovers (ncos) co-associated gene conversions yet
been characterised due lack informative markers. examine all
recombination events high marker resolution, sequenced haploid genomes 
of two parental strains, two recombinant clones derived ticks fed on
cattle simultaneously co-infected two different parasite
isolates.
results: comparing genome sequences, able genotype 64
thousand snp markers average spacing 127 bp two progeny clones.
previously unrecognized cos sub-telomeric regions detected. 50% 
co breakpoints accompanied gene conversion events. high fraction
of cos accompanied gene conversions demonstrated contributions meiotic 
recombination diversity evolutionary success t. parva, the
process redistributed existing genetic variations, also altered
allelic frequencies. compared cos, ncos frequently observed more
uniformly distributed across genome. progeny clones, genomic regions 
with snp markers reduced frequency cos ncos, suggesting the
sequence divergence parental strains high enough adversely
affect recombination frequencies. intra-species polymorphism analysis identified 
81 loci likely selection sequenced genomes.
conclusions: using whole genome sequencing two recombinant clones their
parents, generated maps cos, ncos, co-associated gene conversion events
for t. parva. data comprises one highest-resolution genome-wide
analyses multiple outcomes meiotic recombination pathogen. the
study also demonstrates usefulness high throughput sequencing typing for
detailed analysis recombination organisms conventional genetic
analysis technically difficult.
