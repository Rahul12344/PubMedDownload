vaccinia virus (vacv)-derived vectors popular candidates vaccination
against diseases hiv-1, malaria tuberculosis. however, genomes 
encode multitude proteins immunomodulatory functions, several 
reduce immunogenicity vectors. hitherto limited studies have
investigated whether removal immunomodulatory genes combination
can increase vaccine efficacy further. end constructed viruses based
on vacv strain western reserve (wr) lacking three intracellular innate
immunomodulators (n1, c6 k7). genes selected encoded
proteins known functions innate immunity deletion gene
individually caused decrease virus virulence murine intranasal
and intradermal models infection increase immunogenicity. data
presented demonstrate deletion two, three genes in
combination attenuated virus incremental manner. however, 
vaccinated mice challenged vacv wr double triple gene deletion 
viruses provided weaker protection challenge. accompanied by
inferior memory cd8(+) cell responses lower neutralising antibody titres.
this study indicates that, least three genes studied context of
vacv wr, single gene deletion viruses best vaccine vectors, 
increased attenuation induced deletion additional genes decreased
immunogenicity. data highlight fine balance complex relationship
between viral attenuation immunogenicity. given proteins encoded 
the genes examined study known affect specific aspects innate
immunity, set viruses constructed interesting tools probe 
role innate immune response influencing immune memory vaccine
efficacy.
