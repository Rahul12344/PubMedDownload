surveillance drug-resistant parasites human blood major effort in
malaria control. report contrasting antifolate resistance polymorphisms
in plasmodium falciparum parasites human blood compared with
parasites anopheles vector mosquitoes sleeping huts rural zambia. dna 
encoding p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (ec 1.5.1.3) amplified pcr 
with allele-specific restriction enzyme digestions. markedly prevalent
pyrimethamine-resistant mutants evident human p. falciparum
infections--s108n (>90%), n51i, c59r, 108n+51i+59r triple mutants
(30-80%). resistance level may selection pressure due decades 
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine use region. contrast, cycloguanil-resistant
mutants detected low frequency parasites human blood
samples-s108t (13%), a16v 108t+16v double mutants (âˆ¼4%). surprisingly,
pyrimethamine-resistant mutants low prevalence (2-12%) the
midguts anopheles arabiensis vector mosquitoes, cycloguanil-resistant
mutants highly prevalent-s108t (90%), a16v 108t+16v double
mutant (49-57%). structural analysis dihydrofolate reductase silico 
modeling revealed key difference enzyme within nadph binding pocket,
predicting s108n enzyme reduced stability s108t enzyme to
have increased stability. conclude p. falciparum bear highly
host-specific drug-resistant polymorphisms, likely reflecting different
selective pressures found humans mosquitoes. thus, may useful to
sample human mosquito vector infections accurately ascertain the
epidemiological status drug-resistant alleles.
