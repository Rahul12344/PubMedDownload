plasmodium falciparum, causative agent deadliest form human
malaria, alternates expression variable antigens, encoded members a
multi-copy gene family named var. var2csa, var gene implicated in
pregnancy-associated malaria, translational repression regulated unique
upstream open reading frame (uorf) found 5' utr. here, report that
this translated uorf significantly alters transcription and
posttranslational protein trafficking. parasite alter protein's
destination without modifications protein itself, instead an
element within 5' utr transcript. uorf-dependent localization was
confirmed single molecule storm imaging, followed fusion uorf a
reporter gene changes cellular localization cytoplasmic to
er-associated. data point towards novel regulatory role uorf in
protein trafficking, important implications pathology of
pregnancy-associated malaria.
