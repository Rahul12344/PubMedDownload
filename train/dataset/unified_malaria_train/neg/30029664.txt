background: although sri lanka considered malaria-free nation, threat
of re-emergence outbreaks still remains due high prevalence and
abundance malaria vectors. analysis population genetic structure malaria
vectors considered one vital components implementing
successful vector control programmes. present study conducted to
determine population genetic structure three abundant malaria vectors;
anopheles subpictus sensu lato (s.l.), anopheles peditaneatus anopheles vagus
from five administrative districts two climatic zones; intermediate zone
(badulla kurunegala districts) dry zone (ampara, batticoloa jaffna
districts) sri lanka using mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase
subunit (coi).
methods: adult mosquitoes an. subpictus s.l., an. peditaeniatus, an. vagus
were collected five study sites located five districts using cattle
baited traps backpack aspirators. representative samples species that
were morphologically confirmed selected locality generating coi
sequences (> 6 good quality sequences per species per locality).
results: anopheles subpictus s.l. specimens collected study belonged
to two sibling species; an. subpictus 'a' (from study sites except from
jaffna) an. subpictus 'b' (only jaffna). results haplotype and
nucleotide diversity indices showed three species high
genetic diversity. although high significant pairwise difference observed
between an. subpictus 'a' 'b' (fst> 0.950, p < 0.05), no
significant genetic population structures within an. peditaeniatus, an. vagus and
an. subpictus species (p > 0.05), indicating possible gene flow these
populations.
conclusions: gene flow among populations an. peditaeniatus, an. vagus 
an. subpictus species evident. application vector control measures
against mosquito species must done close monitoring since gene flow
can assist spread insecticide resistance genes vast geographical
area.
