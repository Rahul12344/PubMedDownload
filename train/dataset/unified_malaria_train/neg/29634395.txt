malaria life-threatening infectious disease continues major
public health crisis many parts tropical world. plasmodium falciparum
is responsible majority mortality morbidity associated with
malaria. intraerythrocytic cycle, p. falciparum releases three
proteins high histidine content follows: histidine-rich protein 1 (hrp1),
histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2), histidine-rich protein 3 (hrp3). currently, 
most diagnostic tests p. falciparum infection target hrp2, number
of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) hrp2 developed use hrp2 
detection quantification. parasites hrp2 deletions, detection
of hrp3 could augment sensitivity detection system. combination of
both hrp2 hrp3 mabs detection system enhance test
sensitivity. hrp quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa),
both hrp2 hrp3 contribute result, relative contribution of
hrp2 hrp3 unable investigate, nonavailability hrp3
specific antibody elisa. hence elisa test system based hrp3 also
essential detection quantification. much documented the
literature hrp3 antigen hrp3 specific mabs polyclonal antibodies
(pabs). present study, recombinant hrp3 expressed escherichia coli 
and purified ni-nta agarose column. purified rhrp3 used the
generation characterization monoclonal pabs. purification of
monoclonal pabs done using mixed-mode chromatography sorbent,
phenylpropylamine hypercelâ„¢. purified antibodies, sandwich elisa was
developed. sandwich elisa method explored detect quantify hrp3 
p. falciparum spent medium. generated mabs could potentially used
for detection quantification p. falciparum hrp3.
