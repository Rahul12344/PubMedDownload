increasing evidence shows spatial organization transcription an
important epigenetic factor eukaryotic gene regulation. malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum shows remarkably complex pattern gene expression
during erythrocytic cycle, paradoxically contrasting relatively low 
number putative transcription factors encoded genome. spatial
organization nuclear subcompartments correlated regulation
of virulence genes. here, investigate nuclear architecture of
transcription asexual cycle malaria parasites. mammals,
transcription organized discrete nucleoplasmic sites p. falciparum,
but strikingly lower number foci. automated analysis 3d images
shows number intensity transcription sites vary significantly
between rings trophozoites, although nuclear volume remains constant.
transcription sites spatially reorganized asexual cycle, a
higher proportion foci located outermost nuclear region rings,
whereas trophozoites, foci evenly distributed throughout nucleoplasm. 
as higher eukaryotes, transcription sites predominantly found areas 
low chromatin density. immunofluorescence analysis shows transcription sites
form exclusive nuclear compartment, different compartments defined by
the silenced active chromatin markers. conclusion, data suggest 
transcription spatially contained discrete foci developmentally
regulated asexual cycle malaria parasites located areas of
low chromatin density.
