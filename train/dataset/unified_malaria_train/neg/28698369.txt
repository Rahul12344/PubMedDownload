t-follicular helper (tfh) cells differentiate multistep process,
culminating germinal center (gc) localized gc-tfh cells provide support
to gc-b cells. t-follicular regulatory (tfr) cells critical roles the
control tfh cells gc formation. although tfh-cell differentiation is
inhibited il-2, regulatory (treg) cell differentiation survival depend
on it. here, describe cd25- subpopulation within murine human
pd1+cxcr5+foxp3+ tfr cells. preferentially located gc be
clearly differentiated cd25+ non-gc-tfr, tfh, effector treg (etreg)
cells expression wide range molecules. comparison cd25+ tfr 
and etreg cells, cd25- tfr cells partially down-regulate il-2-dependent canonical
treg features, retain suppressive function, simultaneously
up-regulating genes associated tfh gc-tfh cells. suggest that,
similar tfh cells, tfr cells follow differentiation pathway generating a
mature gc-localized subpopulation, cd25- tfr cells.
