background: 2700 genes subject stage-specific regulation the
intraerythrocytic development human malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum. bioinformatic analyses identified large number of
over-represented motifs 5' flanking regions genes may act as
cis-acting factors promoter-based control temporal expression. triaging
these lists provide candidates likely play role regulating
temporal expression challenging, important effectively design
in vitro studies validate role.
methods: report application repeated search variations 5' 
flanking sequences p. falciparum using finding informative regulatory
elements (fire) algorithm.
results: approach repeatedly found short-list high scoring dna motifs,
for cognate specific transcription factors available, appear to
be typically associated upregulation mrna accumulation first
half intraerythrocytic development.
conclusions: propose cis-trans interactions may provide combinatorial 
promoter-based control gene expression complement global mechanisms of
gene regulation account temporal control second half of
intraerythrocytic development.
