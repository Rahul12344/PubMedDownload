background: current trend plasmodium vivax cases imported southeast
asia china sharply increased recently, especially china-myanmar
border (cmb) area. high recombination rates p. vivax populations associated
with varied transmission intensity might cause distinct local selective
pressures. information genetic variability p. vivax area is
scant. hence, study assessed genetic diversity p. vivax genome
sequence cmb area aimed provide information positive selection
of new gene loci.
results: study reports genome-wide survey p. vivax cmb area, using
blood samples local patients identify population-specific selective
processes. result showed considerable genetic diversity mean
pair-wise divergence among sequenced p. vivax isolates higher some
important gene families. using standardized integrated haplotype score
(|ihs|) snps chromosomal regions snps top 1%
distribution, observed top score locus involved 356 genes and
most associated red blood cell invasion immune evasion. 
xp-ehh test also applied important genes associated with
anti-malarial drug resistance observed high positive scores list. this
result suggests p. vivax cmb area facing pressure survive than
any region led strong positive selection genes 
are associated host-parasite interactions.
conclusions: study suggests greater genetic diversity p. vivax 
cmb area positive selection signals invasion drug resistance genes are
consistent history drug use malaria elimination programme in
cmb area. furthermore, result also demonstrates haplotype-based
detecting selection assist genome-wide methods identify the
determinants p. vivax diversity.
