hybrid male sterility (hms) contributes speciation restricting gene flow
between related taxa. detailed cytological characterization reproductive
organs hybrid males important identifying phenotypes help
guide searches speciation genes. investigate possible cellular causes of
hms, performed crosses closely related species anopheles
gambiae complex: an. merus an. gambiae an. coluzzii. demonstrate 
hms african malaria mosquitoes involves two defects reciprocal crosses:
a premeiotic arrest germline stem cells degenerate testes failure 
the reductional meiotic division primary spermatocytes normal-like testes. 
the premeiotic arrest degenerate testes hybrids accompanied strong 
suppression meiotic postmeiotic genes. unlike pure species, sex
chromosomes normal-like testes f1 hybrids largely unpaired during
meiotic prophase chromosomes show various degrees insufficient
condensation. instead entering reductional division meiosis i, primary
spermatocytes prematurely undergo equational mitotic division producing
non-motile diploid sperm. thus, study identified cytogenetic errors in
interspecies hybrids arise early stages postzygotic isolation.
