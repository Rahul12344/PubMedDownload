quantitative reverse transcription pcr (qrt-pcr) integral part of
characterizing immunity anopheles mosquitoes towards plasmodium invasion. 
two anti-plasmodium factors anopheles, thioester-containing protein 1 (tep1)
and nitric oxide synthase (nos), play role refractoriness anopheles
towards plasmodium infection generally expressed infection.
however, less studied anopheles dirus, dominant malaria vector 
southeast asia. furthermore, studies used single reference gene for
normalization gene expression analysis without proper validation. may
lead erroneous quantification expression levels. therefore, present
study characterized investigated expression profiles tep1 nos of
anopheles dirus p.Â berghei infection. prior that, elongation factor
1-alpha (ef1), actin 1 (act) ribosomal protein s7 (s7) genes validated
for suitability set reference genes. tep1 nos expressions in
an. dirus found significantly induced p. berghei infection.
