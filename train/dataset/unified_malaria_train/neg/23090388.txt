malaria infectious disease threatens half world's population.
this debilitating disease caused infection parasites genus
plasmodium. insecticides, bed nets drug therapies lowered prevalence
and death rate associated malaria disease continues plague many 
populations around world. recent years, many organizations suggested 
developing methods complete eradication malaria. most
straightforward effective method potential eradication be
through development low-cost vaccine. achieve eradication, be
necessary develop new vaccine candidates novel systems the
production delivery vaccines. recently, green algae
chlamydomonas reinhardtii used recombinant expression malaria
vaccine candidates including transmission blocking vaccine candidate
pfs48/45. here, discuss potential research future
development low-cost malaria vaccine candidate.
