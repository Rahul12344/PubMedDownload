plasmodium culture vitro often used antimalarial drug evaluation
model, lifecycle p. falciparum culture vitro tends be
disordered, affects research evaluation antimalarial drug
mechanism vitro. combining magnetic bead separation method sorbitol
synchronization method, synchronization method constructed quickly
acquire different lifecycles p. falciparum obtain large amounts of
parasite narrow synchronization window short period. furthermore, the
dihydroartemisinin(dha) used treat early trophozoite phase p.
falciparum 3 d7 4 h. mrna extracted rna-seq conducted to
analyze differential expression mrna drug treatment obtain the
differential gene expression profile. differential expression up-regulated
genes down-regulated genes analyzed according screening criteria
of |log_2fc|&gt;1 p&lt;0.05. there, 262 genes up-regulated 77 genes 
were down-regulated. go functional enrichment analysis differentially 
expressed genes showed enrichment items mainly included cell membrane
components, transporter activity, serine/threonine kinase activity, maurer's
clefts(mcs), rhoptry, antigen variation immune evasion. enrichment of
kegg pathway included malaria, fatty acid metabolism peroxisome.
protein-protein interaction(ppi) analysis showed down-regulated genes in
the modules high degree association included rhoptry, myosin complex,
transporter genes related important life activities malaria
invasion immune escape; up-regulated genes mainly related various
toxic exportins malaria, pfsbp1 mcs. qrt-pcr used verify the
expression level genes, results the
sequencing results. sbp1 significantly up-regulated, antigenic
protein expression levels down-regulated. all, key molecules dha
therapy mainly involved parasites' rhoptry, transporter, antigenic
variation, plasmodium exportin. results offer us many hints guide the
further studies mechanism artemisinin provide new way development
of new antimalarial drugs.
