background: var2csa, member plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1) family, mediates binding p. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes chondroitin sulfate a, surface-associated molecule expressed in
placental cells, plays central role pathogenesis placental
malaria. var2csa target naturally acquired immunity and, such, a
leading vaccine candidate placental malaria. protein very
polymorphic technically challenging sequence. published var2csa sequences,
mostly limited specific domains, generated sequencing of
cloned pcr amplicons using capillary electrophoresis, method time 
consuming costly, performs poorly applied clinical samples
that commonly polyclonal. next-generation sequencing platform, pacific
biosciences (pacbio), offers alternative approach overcome issues.
methods: pcr primers designed target 5 kb segment 5' end of
var2csa resulting amplicons sequenced using pacbio sequencing. the
primers optimized using two laboratory strains validated dna
from 43 clinical samples, extracted dried blood spots filter paper or
from cryopreserved p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. sequence reads were
assembled using smrt-analysis consensustools module.
results: here, pacbio sequencing-based approach recovering segment
encoding majority var2csa's extracellular region described; this
segment includes totality first four domains 5' end var2csa 
(~5 kb), clinical malaria samples. feasibility method is
demonstrated, showing high success rate cryopreserved samples more
limited success dried blood spots stored room temperature, and
characterized genetic variation var2csa locus.
conclusions: method facilitate detailed analysis var2csa genetic
variation adapted sequence hypervariable p. falciparum genes.
