mosquitoes transmit plasmodium certain arboviruses blood feeding, when
they injected along saliva. mosquito saliva interferes host's
hemostasis inflammation response influences transmission success of
some pathogens. one family mosquito salivary gland proteins, named sgs, is
composed large bacterial-type proteins aedes aegypti implicated
as receptors plasmodium basal salivary gland surface. here, we
characterize biology two sgss malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, 
and demonstrate involvement blood feeding. western blots rt-pcr
showed sgs4 sgs5 produced exclusively female salivary glands,
that expression increases age blood feeding, protein
levels fluctuate circadian manner. immunohistochemistry showed sgss are
present acinar cells distal lateral lobes salivary ducts
of proximal lobes. sds-page, western blots, bite blots, immunization via 
mosquito bites showed sgss highly immunogenic form major components 
of mosquito saliva. last, western bioinformatic analyses suggest sgss
are secreted via non-classical pathway involves cleavage 300-kda
soluble fragment smaller membrane-bound fragment. combined, data
strongly suggest sgss play important role blood feeding. together with
their role malaria transmission, propose sgss could used markers
of human exposure mosquito bites development disease control
strategies.
