plasmodium parasites responsible devastating disease malaria that
affects hundreds millions people year. blood stage parasites establish
new permeability pathways (npps) infected red blood cell membranes to
facilitate uptake nutrients removal parasite waste products.
pharmacological inhibition npps expected lead nutrient starvation
and accumulation toxic metabolites resulting parasite death. here, 
screened curated library antimalarial compounds, mmv malaria box,
identifying two compounds inhibit npp function. unexpectedly, metabolic
profiling suggested compounds also inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogense 
(dhodh), required pyrimidine synthesis validated drug
target right. expression yeast dhodh, bypasses need for
the parasite dhodh, increased parasite resistance compounds. these
studies identify two potential candidates therapeutic development that
simultaneously target two essential pathways plasmodium, npp dhodh.
