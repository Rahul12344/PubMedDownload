in trypanosomatids, posttranscriptional controls important regulation
of individual gene expression. achieved combinatorial sets of
rna-binding proteins (rbps) recognize rna regulatory motifs regions of
secondary structure within rnas. analyze potential functional impact an
rbp mrna targets, applied robust technique called tethering
assay. method, protein study attached mrna reporter
through artificial rna-protein interaction. therefore, functional activity
of protein analyzed independently intrinsic ability bind to
rna. making use cell line expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 
(cat) reporter mrna, characterized dozens novel mrna-fate regulators
in cultured trypanosoma brucei. induction candidate fusion protein, 
the effect reporter expression determined rapid cat assay. the
protocol simple typically takes one working day analysis single
protein controls. chapter, provide description materials 
methods tethering method allow assay successfully
deployed laboratory minimal user training.
