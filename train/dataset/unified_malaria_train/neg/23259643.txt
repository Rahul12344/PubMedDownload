background: ability plasmodium falciparum undergo antigenic variation, 
by switching expression among protein variants encoded multigene families,
such var, rif stevor, key survival parasite human
host. rifin protein family divided b types based the
presence absence 25 amino acid motif semi-conserved domain. a
particular type b rifin, pf13_0006, previously shown strongly
transcribed asexual sexual stages p. falciparum vitro.
methods: antibodies recombinant pf13_0006 rifin used in
immunofluorescence confocal imaging 3d7 parasites throughout asexual
reproduction sexual development examine expression pf13_0006.
furthermore, reactivity recombinant pf13_0006 measured plasma samples
collected individuals east west african endemic areas.
results: pf13_0006 rifin variant appeared expressed released
merozoites gametes emergence. 7.4% 12.1% individuals east
and west african endemic areas, respectively, carry plasma antibodies that
recognize recombinant pf13_0006, antibody responses common
among older children.
conclusions: stage specificity pf13_0006 suggests diversity of
rifin variants evolved provide multiple specialized functions different
stages parasite life cycle. data also suggest rifin variants
antigenically similar pf13_0006 occur african parasite populations.
