cerebral malaria (cm) severe complication plasmodium falciparum
infection, associated high mortality long-term cognitive
impairment even effective anti-parasitic treatment administered. (1 , 2) 
supportive therapy needed improve morbidity mortality associated
with condition. accompanying paper, demonstrated the
plasmodium berghei anka (pba) rodent model, cm effectively prevented 
treatment combining sub-lethal doses lipopolysaccharide (lps) vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf). since lps suitable human therapy, we
investigated whether lovastatin would represent suitable substitute. this
compound, widely used lower cholesterol levels plasma, shares lps 
ability elicit anti-inflammatory response activating nrf-2 gene, and
when given p. berghei-infected mice prevents extent onset cm.
we show lovastatin- vegf-treated mice develop cm showed
few signs, any, endothelial damage systemic inflammation. the
combination treatment much effective lovastatin vegf alone.
immunohistochemistry gene expression analysis indicated vegf lps
together overturned two pathogenic mechanisms responsible development
of cm: endothelial damage disregulated activation inflammatory
response. findings provide rationale investigating therapeutic 
potential compounds human cm well inflammatory
pathologies respond poorly steroid non-steroid anti-inflammatory
therapy.
