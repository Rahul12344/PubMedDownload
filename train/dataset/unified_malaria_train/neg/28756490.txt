although selective loss individuals susceptible disease favor the
evolution female preference older males, interrelationship between
age, infection, longevity, mating success remains poorly characterized in
natural populations. longitudinal study 61 male common yellowthroats
(geothlypis trichas), found probability infection hematozoa
increased males aged 1 5Â years. despite significant, negative
association infection longevity partially masked age-effects,
the odds male infected trypanosoma, plasmodium, leucocytozoon 
increased 71-212% per year. nearly 75% males first breeding season
were either uninfected infected single parasite, 50% of
older males infected least two parasites 16% infected 
all three. males escaped infection second breeding season. older
males also likely sire extra-pair young (epy) and, consequence,
infection multiple parasites associated fourfold increase 
odds producing epy. unlike younger males, 80% oldest males a
history either surviving chronic infection recovering. combined with
previous work showing higher diversity major histocompatibility complex
among older males, results suggest song plumage traits that
signal male age common yellowthroats also, perforce, signal resistance to
parasites. preferring older males, females may obtain good genes disease
resistance even absence effect infection male ornamentation.
