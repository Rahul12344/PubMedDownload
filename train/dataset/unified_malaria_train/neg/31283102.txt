the myosin superfamily comprises actin-dependent eukaryotic molecular motors
important variety cellular functions. although well studied many
systems, knowledge functions plasmodium, causative agent of
malaria, restricted. previously, six myosins identified genus,
including three class xiv myosins found apicomplexa ciliates.
the well characterized myoa class xiv myosin essential gliding motility 
and invasion. here, characterize plasmodium myosins throughout the
parasite life cycle show diverse patterns expression
and cellular location. myob myoe, two class xiv myosins, are
expressed invasive stages, apical basal locations, respectively. 
gene deletion revealed myoe involved sporozoite traversal, myof and
myok likely essential asexual blood stages, myoj myob 
essential. myob essential light chain (mcl-b) localised the
apical end ookinetes expressed completely different time points. this
work provides better understanding role actomyosin motors in
apicomplexan parasites, particularly motile invasive stages of
plasmodium sexual asexual development within mosquito.
