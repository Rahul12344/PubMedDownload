deletion pfhrp2 gene plasmodium falciparum lead false-negative
rapid diagnostic test (rdt) results, constituting major challenge for
evidence-based malaria treatment. analyzed whole genome sequences 
138 p. falciparum clinical samples collected china-myanmar boarder for
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletions. found pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions 9.4%
and 3.6% samples, respectively, samples harboring deletions both
genes. pfhrp2 deletions showed 2 distinct breakpoints, representing 2
different chromosomal deletion events. phylogenetic analysis performed using
genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed 2 pfhrp2 breakpoint
groups well pfhrp3-negative parasites formed separate clades,
suggesting might resulted clonal expansion pfhrp2- and
pfhrp3-negative parasites. findings highlight need urgent surveys
to determine prevalence pfhrp2-negative parasites causing false-negative
rdt results plan switching rdts pending survey results.
