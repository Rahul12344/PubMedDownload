background: glutamate-rich protein (glurp) malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum key surface antigen serves component clinical
vaccine. moreover, glurp gene also employed routinely genetic marker 
for malarial genotyping epidemiological studies. extensive size
polymorphisms glurp well recorded, extent sequence diversity of
this gene rarely investigated. present study aimed explore genetic 
diversity glurp natural populations p. falciparum.
results: polymorphic c-terminal repetitive r2 region glurp sequences 
65 p. falciparum isolates thailand generated combined data
from 103 worldwide isolates generate glurp database. collection was
comprised 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique glurp subtypes, characterized 18
types amino acid repeat units (aau). these, 28 glurp subtypes, formed 10
aau types, detected p. falciparum thailand. among them, 19 glurp
subtypes 2 aau types described first time thai parasite
population. aau sequences highly conserved, likely due to
negative selection. standard fst analysis revealed shared distributions of
glurp types among p. falciparum populations, providing evidence gene flow 
among different demographic populations.
conclusions: sequence diversity causing size variations glurp thai p.
falciparum populations detected, caused non-synonymous substitutions 
in repeat units insertion/deletion aspartic acid glutamic acid
codons repeat units. p. falciparum population structure based on
glurp showed promising implications development glurp-based vaccines
and monitoring vaccine efficacy.
