entamoeba histolytica obligate protozoan parasite humans, amebiasis,
an infectious disease targets intestine and/or liver, second
most common cause human death due protozoan malaria. although
amebiasis usually asymptomatic, e. histolytica potent pathogenic
potential. host infection, parasite exposed reactive oxygen
species produced released cells innate immune system at
the site infection. ability parasite survive oxidative stress
(os) essential successful invasion host. although effects 
os regulation gene expression e. histolytica the
characterization proteins whose function parasite's defense
against os previously studied, knowledge oxidized proteins e.
histolytica lacking. order fill knowledge gap, performed a
large-scale identification quantification oxidized proteins in
oxidatively stressed e. histolytica trophozoites using resin-assisted capture
coupled mass spectrometry. detected 154 oxidized proteins (oxs) the
functions proteins associated antioxidant activity,
maintaining parasite's cytoskeleton, translation, catalysis, transport.
we also found oxidation gal/galnac impairs function and
contributes inhibition e. histolytica adherence host cells. also 
provide evidence arginase, enzyme converts l-arginine into
l-ornithine urea, involved protection parasite os.
collectively, results emphasize importance os critical
regulator e. histolytica's functions indicate new role arginase in
e. histolytica's resistance os.
