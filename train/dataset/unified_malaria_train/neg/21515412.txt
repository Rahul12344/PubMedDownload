plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria pathogen developed
resistance existing drugs making indispensable discover new drugs. in
order predict drug targets silico, useful model metabolism is
needed. however, automatically reconstructed network models typically cover 
non-confirmed enzymes confirmed enzymes known gene products. furthermore,
it needs considered parasite takes advantage metabolism 
the host. compared several reconstructed network models aimed find 
best suitable reconstruction detecting drug targets silico. we
computationally reconstructed metabolism based automatically inferred
enzymes compared reconstructed model based on
enzymes whose coding genes known. additionally, tested integrating
enzymes host cell beneficial analysis. employed several 
well established criteria defining essential enzymes including chokepoints,
betweenness centrality (or load-points), connectivity diameter the
networks. comparing modeling results comprehensive list known drug 
targets p. falciparum, showed best discovery success a
network model consisting enzymes parasite alone coding
genes known.
