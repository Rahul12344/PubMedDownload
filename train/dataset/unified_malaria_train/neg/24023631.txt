host resistance parasites depends three aspects: ability to
prevent, control clear infections. vertebrates immune system consists 
of innate adaptive immunity. innate immunity particularly important for
preventing infection eradicating established infections early stage
while adaptive immunity slow, powerful, essential controlling
infection intensities eventually clearing infections. major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules central adaptive immunity, 
studies parasite resistance mhc wild animals found effects both
infection intensity (parasite load) infection status (infected not). it
seems mhc affect ability control infection intensities the
ability clear infections. however, two aspects rarely been
considered simultaneously, relative importance natural populations
is therefore unclear. investigate mhc class genotype affects
infection intensity infection status frequent avian malaria infection 
haemoproteus majoris natural population blue tits cyanistes caeruleus. we
found significant negative association single mhc allele and
infection intensity association infection status. blue tits that
carry specific mhc allele seem able suppress h. majoris infection intensity,
while evidence allele also effect clearance the
h. majoris infection, result contrast previous studies 
mhc avian malaria. likely explanation could clearance rate of
avian malaria parasites differs avian malaria lineages and/or between
avian hosts.
