introduction: leptospirosis neglected zoonotic disease caused bacteria 
of genus leptospira. africa frequently mistaken frequently
occurring conditions malaria. aim study identify
rodent species involved transmission disease, prevalence of
pathogenic leptospira spp. selected rodent species risk factors human 
leptospirosis.
material methods: conducted descriptive exploratory epidemiological 
and molecular study mozambique island city 2015. six neighborhoods,
comprising 30 households randomly selected. people selected
180 households interviewed regarding awareness disease, the
presence rodents houses, chemicals used eliminate them, sewage
disposal, water supply system, key issues related disease. in
each neighborhood trapped 10 rodents morphometric study identify 
species molecular isolation leptospira dna. extracted kidneys 
57/60 rodents trapped, performed nested polymerase chain reaction
targeting rrs 16s ribosomal dna lipl32 genes identification leptospira
genus pathogenic leptospira spp. respectively.
results: 180 participants 92 (51%) reported heard leptospirosis;
107 (59%) disease; 151 (83%) reported existence rats their
house; 100 (56%) latrines; 118 (66%) used chemicals kill rats; 102
(57%) used well water 114 (63%) used trash containers. prevalent
rodent species captured rattus norvegicus 36/60 (60%), followed rattus
rattus 19/60 (31.67%) mus musculus 3/60 (5%). rrs 16s ribosomal dna was
identified 20/57 (35.%) rodents. two positive lipl32 gene, 
giving overall pathogenic leptospira infection 3.5% (2/57). rodent
species identified carriers pathogenic leptospira rattus norvegicus
(1) r. rattus (1).
conclusion: first study mozambique identify presence of
pathogenic species leptospira using molecular tools. leptospirosis risk
factors mozambique island city rodent's infestation, limited disease
awareness, lack access clean water, insufficient resources waste
collection, greater clustering households, poor sanitation environment and
degradation living conditions. pathogenic leptospira spp. present the
area studied least two species rodents, r. rattus r.
norvegi-cus potentially involved transmission causal agents 
the disease.
