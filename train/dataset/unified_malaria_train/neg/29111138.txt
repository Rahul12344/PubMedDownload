killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (kirs) genomic regions suggested
to influence malaria pathogenesis infection susceptibility. kirs known as
activating natural killer (nk) cell receptors, upon binding their
corresponding human leukocyte antigen (hla) ligands cause lysis infected
cell. examined potential association kir genes complicated
malaria (cm) among north indians study evaluated kir
receptor-hla ligand association severity disease considering the
uncomplicated malaria (ucm) subjects control. molecular profiling kir and
hla carried using pcr-ssp method. susceptible association found
for individuals possessing kir2ds2 (or=1.76, p-value=0.0390), kir2dl1 (or=2.87,
p-value=0.0005) kir2dl3 (or=2.74, p-value=0.0011) genes cm. was
supported strong linkage disequilibrium observed 2ds2-2dl2 (d́=0.87,
r2=0.54) cm. whereas receptor-ligand association revealed risk
association kir2ds2-hlac1 (or=2.08, p-value=0.0229), kir2dl3-hlac1
(or=1.79, p-value=0.0301), kir2dl1-hlac2 (or=2.10, p-value=0.0175)
combinations complicated malaria. frequency different kir genes are
more less similar observed african population showing much
genetic diversity kir level context malarial infection. conclusion,
our data indicates kir gene loci differentially influenced malarial outcome
in north indians particular kir2ds2 gene appeared associated
with disease severity.
