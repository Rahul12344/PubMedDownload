the subcellular localization function variant subtelomeric multigene
families plasmodium vivax remain vastly unknown. among them, vir
superfamily putatively involved antigenic variation mediating
adherence endothelial receptors. absence continuous vitro
culture system p. vivax, generated p. falciparum transgenic lines
expressing vir proteins infer location function. chose three proteins
pertaining subfamilies (vir17), c (vir14) (vir10), domains and
secondary structures predictably traffic proteins different
subcellular compartments. here, showed vir17 remained inside parasite
and around merozoites, whereas vir14 vir10 exported membrane of
infected red blood cells (irbcs) apparent independent pathway maurer's
clefts. remarkably, vir14 exposed surface irbcs mediated
adherence different endothelial receptors expressed cho cells static 
conditions. physiological flow conditions, however, cytoadherence 
observed icam-1, receptor whose adherence specifically 
and significantly inhibited antibodies conserved motifs vir
proteins. immunofluorescence studies using antibodies also showed different
subcellular localizations vir proteins p. vivax-infected reticulocytes from
natural infections. data suggest vir proteins trafficked to
different cellular compartments functionally demonstrates vir proteins
can specifically mediate cytoadherence icam-1 endothelial receptor.
