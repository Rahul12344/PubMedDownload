increasing drug resistance plasmodium falciparum important global health
burden reverses malarial control achieved far. hence,
understanding molecular mechanisms drug resistance epicenter the
development agenda novel diagnostic therapeutic (drugs/vaccines) targets 
for malaria. study, report global comparative transcriptome profiling 
(rna-seq) characterize difference transcriptome 48-h
intraerythrocytic stage chloroquine-sensitive chloroquine-resistant p.
falciparum (3d7 dd2) strains. two p. falciparum 3d7 dd2 strains 
distant geographical origin, netherlands indochina, respectively. the
strains cultured vitro method harvested 48-h
intraerythrocytic stage 5% parasitemia. whole transcriptome sequencing
was performed using illumina hiseq 2500 platform paired-end reads. reads
were aligned reference p. falciparum genome. alignment percentages
for 3d7, dd2, dd2 w/cq strains 85.40%, 89.13%, 84%, respectively.
nearly 40% transcripts known gene function, whereas remaining
genes (about 60%) unknown function. genes involved immune evasion
showed significant difference strains. differential gene
expression sensitive resistant strains measured using the
cuffdiff program p-value cutoff â‰¤0.05. collectively, study
identified differentially expressed genes 3d7 dd2 strains, we
found 89 genes upregulated 227 downregulated. contrary,
for 3d7 dd2 w/cq strains, 45 genes upregulated 409 were
downregulated. differentially regulated genes code, large, for
surface antigens involved invasion, pathogenesis, host-parasite
interactions, among others. exhibition transcriptional differences between
these strains p. falciparum contributes understanding attendant,
drug-sensitivity phenotypes, extension, current efforts maintaining
global health developing novel diagnostics therapeutics malaria.
