erythrocyte invasion plasmodium falciparum merozoites central to
blood-stage infection malaria pathogenesis. intricate process is
coordinated multiple parasite adhesins bind erythrocyte receptors and
mediate invasion several alternate pathways. p. falciparum expresses 2700
genes blood-stages, identity function many remains
unknown. here, identified characterized novel p. falciparum rhoptry
associated adhesin (pfra) mediates erythrocyte invasion the
sialic-acid dependent pathway. pfra appears play significant functional role
as conserved across different plasmodium species. localized the
rhoptries translocated merozoite surface. native and
recombinant pfra specifically bound erythrocytes sialic-acid dependent,
chymotrypsin trypsin resistant manner, abrogated pfra antibodies
confirming role erythrocyte invasion. pfra antibodies inhibited erythrocyte 
invasion combination antibodies parasite ligands
produced additive inhibitory effect, thus validating important role in
erythrocyte invasion. thus identified novel p. falciparum adhesin 
binds sialic acid containing erythrocyte receptor. observations
substantiate strategy block p. falciparum erythrocyte invasion by
simultaneously targeting multiple conserved merozoite antigens involved in
alternate invasion pathways.
