plasmodium vivax invasion human erythrocytes requires interaction p.
vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) host receptor, duffy antigen
(fy) erythrocyte surface. consequently, pvdbp leading vaccine
candidate. binding domain pvdbp lies cysteine-rich portion the
molecule called region ii (pvdbpii). pvdbpii contains three distinct subdomains
based upon intramolecular disulfide bonding patterns. subdomain 2 (sd2) highly
polymorphic thought contain many key residues binding fy, 
sd1 sd3 comparatively conserved role fy binding well 
understood. examine relative contributions different subdomains 
binding fy abilities elicit strain-transcending
binding-inhibitory antibodies, evaluated recombinant proteins sd1+2, sd2,
sd3, sd3+, includes 24 residues sd2. recombinant
subdomains, except sd2, bound variably human erythrocytes, constructs
containing sd3 showing best binding. antisera raised laboratory animals
against sd3, sd3+, sd2+3 inhibited binding full-length pvdbpii, 
is strain transcending, whereas antisera generated sd1+2 sd2 failed to
generate blocking antibodies. murine monoclonal antibodies generated
to full-length pvdbpii significant binding-inhibitory activity
recognized sd3. thus, sd3 binds fy elicits blocking antibodies,
indicating contains residues critical fy binding could the
basis strain-transcending candidate vaccine p. vivax.
