nucleic acids expected novel effective medicines, although require 
drug delivery system (dds). complexes nucleic acids cationic liposomes
and cationic polymers mainly used dds clinical use. however,
most cationic complexes disadvantages strong cytotoxicity low
biocompatibility. previously found plasmid dna (pdna) complex coated
with biodegradable γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-pga) provided adequate gene expression 
without cytotoxicity. based results, developed new dds
(multi-functional nano-device) pdna using biodegradable polyamino acids. a
typical cationic polyamino acid, poly-l-lysine (pll), complexed pdna.
the binary complexes, however, showed low gene expression high cytotoxicity. 
gene expression enhanced addition poly-l-histidine (plh) binary 
complexes. plh increase endosome escape complexes inducing
ph-buffering effects. quaternary complexes (pdna-pll-plh-γ-pga complexes)
exhibited high gene expression low cytotoxicity. furthermore, used
dendrigraft poly-l-lysine (dgl) instead pll plh enhance gene
expression. dgl sterically congested cations biodegradable. the
ternary complexes (pdna-dgl-γ-pga complexes) exhibited markedly high gene
expression low cytotoxicity. pdna-dgl-γ-pga complexes also high gene 
expression marginal zone (rich dendritic cells) spleen after
intravenous injection mice. results indicate pdna-dgl-γ-pga
complexes may useful vaccine vectors. therefore prepared novel malaria
dna vaccine using plasmodium yoelii gpi8p-transamidase-related protein pdna
(pytam). pytam-dgl-γ-pga complexes markedly improved survival time model
mice infected malaria.
