pneumonia, hiv/aids, tuberculosis, malaria several diseases caused by
pathogens largely contribute enormous burden infectious diseases. 
the last decades, impact infectious diseases population 
drastic remains major health concern even today. despite advances in
science technology era health development, a
substantial knowledge gap understanding molecular basis these
infectious diseases. availability valuable genomic information a
number pathogens hosts improved understanding disease
pathogenesis always useful addressing important biological
questions. primary reason lies fact genes best reflect the
status cell. proteins represent functional molecules cell are
ultimately responsible controlling aspects cellular function. their
existence different isoforms owing posttranslational modifications suggests
that many proteins produced gene. furthermore, mrnas
are translated times justifying need develop additional tools to
study proteins separate molecular entities. presence absence under
disease conditions, varying levels, different forms, functions need be
carefully studied understand molecular alterations response disease.
