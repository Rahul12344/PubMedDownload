background: plasmodium vivax infection characterized dormant hepatic
stage, hypnozoite activated varying periods time after
clearance primary acute blood-stage, resulting relapse. differentiation
between treatment failure new infections requires characterization initial
infections, relapses, clone multiplicity vivax malaria infections.
methodology/principal findings: parasite dna obtained primary/relapse paired
blood samples 30 patients p. vivax infection brazil analyzed using
10 molecular markers (8 microsatellites msp-1 blocks 2 10). cloning of
pcr products genotyping used identify low-frequency clones of
parasites. demonstrated high frequency multiple-clone infections 
primary relapse infections. alleles identified per locus, the
combination alleles produced many haplotypes. consequently, majority
of parasites involved relapse showed haplotypes distinct 
of primary infections. plasmodium vivax relapse characterized temporal
variations predominant parasite clones.
conclusions/significance: high rate low frequency alleles observed both
primary relapse infections, along temporal variation predominant 
alleles, might source reported heterologous hypnozoite activation. 
findings complicate concept heterologous activation, suggesting the
involvement undetermined mechanisms based host environmental factors 
the simultaneous activation multiple clones hypnozoites.
