background: anopheles culicifacies, main vector human malaria rural
india, complex five sibling species. despite phylogenetically
related, naturally selected subgroup species b sibling species complex 
is found poor vector malaria. attempted understand the
differences vector non-vector anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes in
terms transcriptionally activated nitric oxide synthase (acnos) physiologies
to elucidate mechanism refractoriness. identification differences
between genes gene products may impart refractory phenotype can
facilitate development novel malaria transmission blocking strategies.
methodology/principal findings: conducted study phylogenetically related 
susceptible (species a) refractory (species b) sibling species an.
culicifacies mosquitoes characterize biochemical molecular differences 
acnos gene gene elements ability inhibit oocyst growth. we
demonstrate species b, acnos specific activity nitrite/nitrates in
mid-guts haemolymph higher compared species invasion of
the mid-gut p. vivax beginning course blood feeding. 
semiquantitative rt-pcr real time pcr data acnos concluded gene 
is abundantly expressed midgut species b species is
transcriptionally upregulated post blood meals. dietary feeding l-name along
with blood meals significantly inhibited midgut acnos activity leading an
increase oocyst production an. culicifacies species b.
conclusions/significance: hypothesize upregulation mosquito innate
cytotoxicity due nos refractory strain plasmodium vivax infection may
contribute natural refractoriness an. culicifacies mosquito population.
this innate capacity refractory mosquitoes could represent ancestral
function mosquito immune system parasite could utilized
to understand molecular basis refractoriness planning effective vector 
control strategies.
