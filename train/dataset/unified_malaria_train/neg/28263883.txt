the gold standard malaria diagnosis microscopic examination giemsa 
stained thick blood smears though microscopy mostly may detect presence
of plasmodium species infections asymptomatic samples. reported study, 
we used two diagnostic methods viz. conventional microscopic examination 
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay analyse asymptomatic malaria
samples. pcr assay amplifying 18s small-subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna) gene 
plasmodium 122 samples confirmed 68% isolates asymptomatic p. falciparum
infections; 87.9% mono-infections. observed p. malariae positive
samples diagnosed microscopic examination blood smears the
pcr based diagnostic method revealed presence 12% p. malariae infections
in asymptomatic samples yaoundé region cameroon official cases
of p. malariae reported decade. sequence analysis
further confirmed presence 12% p. malariae malaria positive samples
with three base pair deletions five substitutions ssu rrna gene.
