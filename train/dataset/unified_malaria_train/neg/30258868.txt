this review considers available evidence mechanisms conferred adaptive
advantages face specific infectious diseases. short, explore a
number genetic conditions, carry benefits adverse circumstances 
including exposure infectious agents. examples discussed conditions
known result resistance specific infectious disease, been
proposed associated resistance various infectious diseases.
these infectious disease-genetic disorder pairings include malaria and
hemoglobinopathies, cholera cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis tay-sachs
disease, mycotic abortions phenylketonuria, infection enveloped viruses
and disorders glycosylation, infection filoviruses niemann-pick c1
disease, well rabies myasthenia gravis. also discuss two genetic
conditions lead infectious disease hypersusceptibility, although did
not cover large number immunologic defects leading infectious disease
hypersusceptibilities. four resistance-associated pairings
(malaria/hemogloginopathies, cholera/cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis/tay-sachs, and
mycotic abortions/phenylketonuria) appear result selection pressures
in geographic regions specific infectious agent endemic. the
other pairings appear based selection pressure instead may be
serendipitous. nonetheless, research investigating relationships may lead
to treatment options aforementioned diseases exploiting established
mechanisms genetically affected cells infectious organisms. may 
prove invaluable starting point research case diseases that
currently reliably curative treatments, e.g., hiv, rabies, ebola.
