the study genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum necessary to
understand distribution dynamics parasite populations. genetic
diversity p. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 2 extensively
studied different parts world. however, limited data available from
india. study aimed determine genetic diversity multiplicity
of infection (moi) p. falciparum population kolkata, west bengal, india. 
total 80day-zero blood samples kolkata collected a
therapeutic efficacy study 2008-2009. dna extracted; allelic frequency and
diversity investigated pcr-genotyping method msp1 msp2 gene and
fragment sizing done bio-rad gel-doc system using image lab (version 4.1) 
software. p. falciparum msp1 msp2 markers highly polymorphic low
allele frequencies. kolkata, 27 msp1 different genotypes (including 11of k1, 6
of mad20 10 ro33 allelic families) 30 different msp2 genotypes (of
which 17 13 belonged fc27 3d7 allelic families, respectively) were
recorded. majority genotypes occurred frequency 10%. 
mean moi msp1 msp2 gene 2.05 3.72, respectively. p.
falciparum population kolkata genetically diverse. frequencies of
most msp1 msp2 alleles low, probability new infection with
genotype identical pretreatment infection rare. this
information serve baseline data evaluation malaria control
interventions well monitoring parasite population structure.
