the diversity specificity cell receptors (tcr), characteristics of
t-cell surface marker, central adaptive immunity. tcr variability is
required successful immunization coverage structural foundation 
is indispensable valid identification short antigen peptides (derived 
from degraded antigens) presented major histocompatibility molecules 
on surfaces antigen-presenting cells. despite vast t-cell repertoire, 
biased αβ tcr become common theme immunology. date, numerous examples
of tcr bias observed various diseases. immunotherapy strategies that
are based αβ cell responses also emerged prominent component of
clinical treatment. present review, briefly summarize current
knowledge regarding basic structural information molecular mechanisms
underlying tcr diversity. moreover, outline role tcr repertoire bias in
some diseases, application therapeutic interventions, play
significant roles disease progression, even patients good
prognosis.
