background: plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-3 (pfmsp-3) a
target naturally acquired immunity p. falciparum infection a
promising vaccine candidate critical role erythrocyte
invasion parasite. understanding genetic diversity pfmsp-3 is
important recognizing genetic nature evolutionary aspect gene in
the natural p. falciparum population designing effective vaccine based
on antigen.
methods: blood samples collected p. falciparum-infected patients naung
cho pyin oo lwin, myanmar, 2015 used study. pfmsp-3 was
amplified polymerase chain reaction, cloned, sequenced. genetic
polymorphism natural selection myanmar pfmsp-3 analysed using the
programs dnastar, mega6, dnasp 5.10.00. genetic diversity natural
selection global pfmsp-3 also comparatively analysed.
results: myanmar pfmsp-3 displayed 2 different alleles, 3d7 k1. 3d7
allelic type predominant population, genetic polymorphism less
diverse k1 allelic type. polymorphic characters allelic
types caused amino acid substitutions, insertions, deletions. amino
acid substitutions mainly occurred alanine heptad repeat domains,
whereas insertions deletions found glutamate rich domain.
overall patterns amino acid polymorphisms detected myanmar pfmsp-3 were
similar global pfmsp-3 population, novel amino acid changes were
observed myanmar pfmsp-3 low frequencies. complicated patterns natural
selection recombination events predicted global pfmsp-3, which
may act major driving forces maintain generate genetic diversity the
global pfmsp-3 population.
conclusion: global pfmsp-3 revealed genetic polymorphisms, suggesting the
functional structural consequences polymorphisms considered 
in designing vaccine based pfmsp-3. examination genetic diversity
of pfmsp-3 global p. falciparum population necessary gain in-depth
insight population structure evolutionary aspect global pfmsp-3.
