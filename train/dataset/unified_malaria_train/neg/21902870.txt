assess biogeographical relationships among haemosporidian blood parasites and
an avian host, new zealand bellbird (meliphagidae, anthornis melanura). four 
plasmodium haplotypes identified among 93 infected bellbirds (693 screened) 
using nested pcr mitochondrial dna cytochrome b gene fragment. most
common lineage, lin1 (11%), confined northern new zealand falls within 
a known clade plasmodium (subgenus novyella) sp. infecting australian
meliphagids. lin1 differs within clade 4 9% sequence divergence
suggestive endemic lineage new zealand. widespread lineage,
lin2 (2%), exact match global cosmopolitan (p. elongatum grw06). two
rare lineages, lin3 lin4 less abundant, geographically restricted within 
new zealand <1% sequence divergence p. (novyella) sp. (aftru08) and
p. relictum (linoli01) documented africa. first time, provide
