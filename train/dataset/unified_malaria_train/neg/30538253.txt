increasing insecticide resistance malaria-transmitting vectors represents a
public health threat, underlying mechanisms poorly understood. here, a
data integration approach used analyse transcriptomic data comparisons
of insecticide resistant susceptible anopheles populations disparate
geographical regions across african continent. unbiased, integrated
analysis data confirms previously described resistance candidates but
also identifies multiple novel genes involving alternative resistance mechanisms,
including sequestration, transcription factors regulating multiple downstream
effector genes, validated gene silencing. integrated datasets
can interrogated bespoke shiny r script, deployed interactive
web-based application, maps expression resistance candidates and
identifies co-regulated transcripts may give clues function novel 
resistance-associated genes.
