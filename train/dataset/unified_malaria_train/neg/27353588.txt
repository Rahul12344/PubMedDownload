background & objectives: combat problem antimalarial drug resistance,
monitoring changes drug efficacy time periodic surveillance
is essential. since 2009, systematic continuous monitoring done
through nationwide sentinel site system. potential early warning signs like
partner drug resistance markers also monitored clinical samples 
the study areas.
methods: total 1864 patients acute uncomplicated malaria enrolled 
in therapeutic efficacy studies artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(as+sp) plasmodium falciparum; infected p. vivax given
chloroquine (cq). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used distinguish
post-treatment reinfection treatment failures. isolates p. falciparum
were also analysed dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) gene mutations.
results: overall, 1687 (91.7%) patients completed follow-up. the
falciparum patients parasitaemia cleared within 24 h treatment, except
12 patients remained parasite positive 72 h. presence dhfr dhps 
quintuple mutation observed predominantly treatment failure samples. a
daily dose artesunate < 3 mg/kg body weight, age <5 yr, fever 
enrolment associated increased risk treatment failure. as+sp 
in p. falciparum effective > 95% cases sentinel sites except in
northeastern region (ne). chloroquine remained 100% efficacious case p.
vivax infections.
interpretation & conclusion: till 2012, india's national antimalarial drug
resistance monitoring system proved highly efficacious safe towards
first-line antimalarials used country, except northeastern region where
a decline efficacy as+sp observed. led change in
first-line treatment p. falciparum artemether-lumefantrine northeastern
region.
