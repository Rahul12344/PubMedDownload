malaria life-threatening disease one main causes morbidity and
mortality human population. disease also results major
socio-economic burden. rapid spread malaria epidemics developing
countries exacerbated rise drug-resistant parasites and
insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. present, malaria research focused mainly 
on development drugs increased therapeutic effects plasmodium
parasites. however, vaccine disease preferable treatment to
achieve long-term control. trials develop safe effective immunization
protocol control malaria occurring decades, continue
on today; still, effective vaccines available market. recently,
peptide-based vaccines become attractive alternative approach. these
vaccines utilize short protein fragments induce immune responses against
malaria parasites. peptide-based vaccines safer traditional vaccines,
relatively inexpensive produce, composed multiple t- b-cell 
epitopes integrated one antigenic formulation. various combinations, based
on antigen choice, peptide epitope modification delivery mechanism, have
resulted numerous potential malaria vaccines candidates; presently
being studied preclinical clinical trials. review describes 
current landscape peptide-based vaccines, addresses obstacles and
opportunities production malaria vaccines.
