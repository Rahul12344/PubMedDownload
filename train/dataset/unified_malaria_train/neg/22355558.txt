blood stage malaria parasites causing mild self limited infection mice
have obtained either radiation chemical mutagenesis showing the
possibility developing attenuated malaria vaccine. targeted disruption of
plasmepsin-4 (pm4) merozoite surface protein-7 (msp7) genes also induces a
virulence-attenuated phenotype terms absence experimental cerebral
malaria (ecm), delayed increase parasitemia reduced mortality rate. the
decrease virulence parasites lacking either pm4 msp7 however
incomplete dependent parasite mouse strain combination. the
sequential disruption genes induced remarkable virulence-attenuated
blood-stage parasites characterized self-resolving infection low levels
of parasitemia ecm. furthermore, convalescent mice protected 
the challenge p. berghei p. yoelii parasites several months. these
observations provide proof-of-concept step development human malaria
vaccines based genetically attenuated blood-stage parasites.
