background: particular cytokine gene polymorphisms involved regulation
of antibody production. consequences already described il-4, il-10 and
il-13 gene polymorphisms biological parameters antibody levels were
investigated among 576 mothers delivery newborns context of
p. falciparum placental malaria infection.
methods: study took place semi-rural area tori-bossito, in
south-west benin, malaria meso-endemic. six biallelic polymorphisms were
determined quantitative pcr using taqman® pre-designed snp genotyping assays, 
in il-4 (rs2243250, rs2070874), il-10 (rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872) il-13
(rs1800925) genes. antibody responses directed p. falciparum msp-1, msp-2,
msp-3, glurp-r0, glurp-r2 ama-1 recombinant proteins determined by
elisa.
results: maternal il-4(-590)*t/il-4(+33)*t haplotype (one two copies) 
associated favorable maternal condition delivery (high haemoglobin
levels, absence placental parasites) one component, the
il-4(-590)tt genotype, related low igg levels msp-1, msp-2/3d7 and
msp-2/fc27. inversely, maternal il-10(-1082)aa positively associated with
p. falciparum placenta infection delivery. consequence, il-10(-819)*t
allele (in ct tt genotypes) well the
il-10(-1082)*a/il-10(-819)*t/il-10(-592)*a haplotype (one two copies) which
it included, related increased risk anaemia newborns. the
maternal il-10(-1082)aa genotype related high igg levels msp-2/3d7 
ama-1 mothers newborns, respectively. il-13 gene polymorphism only
involved newborn's antibody response ama-1.
conclusion: data revealed il-4 il-10 maternal gene polymorphisms
are likely play role regulation biological parameters pregnant 
women delivery (anaemia, p. falciparum placenta infection) newborns
(anaemia). moreover, il-4, il-10 il-13 maternal gene polymorphisms were
related igg responses msp-1, msp-2/3d7 msp-2/fc27 mothers well as
to ama-1 newborns.
