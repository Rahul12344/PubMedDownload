knockdown resistance (kdr) insects resulting mutation(s) the
voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene one mechanisms resistance
against ddt pyrethroid group insecticides. earlier, reported the
presence two classic kdr mutations, i.e., l1014f l1014s anopheles
stephensi liston, major indian malaria vector affecting mainly urban areas.
this report presents distribution alleles different an. stephensi
populations. seven populations an. stephensi six states india were
screened presence two alternative kdr mutations l1014f l1014s
using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. recorded presence 
of kdr mutations northern indian populations (alwar gurgaon), with
the preponderance l1014s, whereas l1014f present raipur (central
india) chennai (southern india). none kdr mutations found in
ranchi eastern india mangaluru mysuru southern india. study
provides evidence focal pattern distribution kdr alleles india.
