resistance pyrethroids, sole insecticide class recommended treating
bed nets, threatens control major malaria vectors, including anopheles
funestus effective management resistance requires understanding the
dynamics mechanisms driving resistance. here, using genome-wide transcription
and genetic diversity analyses, show shift molecular basis of
pyrethroid resistance southern african populations species is
associated restricted gene flow. across highly endemic and
densely populated regions malawi, an. funestus resistant pyrethroids,
carbamates, organochlorides. genome-wide microarray-based transcription
analysis identified overexpression cytochrome p450 genes main mechanism
driving resistance. up-regulated genes include cytochrome p450s
(cyp) cyp6p9a, cyp6p9b cyp6m7. however, significant shift the
overexpression profile genes detected across south/north transect,
with cyp6p9a cyp6p9b highly overexpressed southern resistance
front cyp6m7 predominant northern front. genome-wide genetic
structure analysis southern african populations an. funestus zambia,
malawi, mozambique revealed restriction gene flow populations,
in line geographical variation observed transcriptomic analysis. 
genetic polymorphism analysis three key resistance genes, cyp6p9a,
cyp6p9b, cyp6m7, support barriers gene flow shaping the
underlying molecular basis pyrethroid resistance across southern africa. 
barrier gene flow likely impact design implementation of
resistance management strategies region.
