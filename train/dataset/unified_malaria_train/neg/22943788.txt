background: avian disease system hawaii offers ideal opportunity to
investigate host-pathogen interactions natural setting. previous studies
have recognized single mitochondrial lineage avian malaria (plasmodium 
relictum) hawaiian islands, cloning sequencing nuclear genes
suggest higher degree genetic diversity.
methods: order evaluate genetic diversity p. relictum population 
level understand host-parasite interactions, modified single-base
extension (sbe) method used explore spatial temporal distribution
patterns single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) thrombospondin-related 
anonymous protein (trap) gene p. relictum infections 121 hatch-year
amakihi (hemignathus virens) east side hawaii island.
results: rare alleles mixed infections documented three eight snp 
loci; first documentation genetically diverse infections p.
relictum population level hawaii. logistic regression revealed the
likelihood infection rare allele increased low-elevation, but
decreased mosquito capture rates increased. inverse relationship between
vector capture rates probability infection rare allele is
unexpected given current theories epidemiology developed human malarias.
conclusions: results study suggest pathogen diversity hawaii 
may driven complex interaction factors including transmission rates,
host immune pressures, parasite-parasite competition.
