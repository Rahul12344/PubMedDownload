background: vector-borne pathogens significant public health concern
worldwide. infections pathogens, emerging, are
likely under-recognized due lack widely-available laboratory tests.
there urgent need advancement diagnostic modalities to
detect new known vector-borne pathogens. evaluated utility of
metagenomic shotgun sequencing (mgs) pathogen agnostic approach for
detecting vector-borne pathogens human blood samples.
methods: residual whole blood samples patients known infection with
babesia microti, borrelia hermsii, plasmodium falciparum, mansonella perstans,
anaplasma phagocytophilum ehrlichia chaffeensis studied. samples
underwent dna extraction, removal human dna, whole genome amplification, and
paired-end library preparation, followed sequencing illumina hiseq 2500.
bioinformatic analysis performed using livermore metagenomics analysis
toolkit (lmat), metagenomic phylogenetic analysis (metaphlan2), genomic origin
through taxonomic challenge (gottcha) kraken 2.
results: eight samples included study (2 samples p.
falciparum a. phagocytophilum). average 27.5 million read pairs was
generated per sample (range, 18.3-38.8 million) prior removal human reads. 
at least one analytic tools able detect four six organisms at
the genus level, organism present five eight specimens the
species level. mansonella ehrlichia species detected the
tools; however, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit amino acid sequence 
analysis suggested presence m. perstans genetic material.
conclusions: mgs promising tool potential evolve a
non-hypothesis driven diagnostic test detect vector-borne pathogens, including
protozoa helminths.
