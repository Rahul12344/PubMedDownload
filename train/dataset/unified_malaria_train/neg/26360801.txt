artemisinin highly effective multidrug-resistant strains plasmodium
falciparum, aetiological agent severe form malaria. however, a
low level accumulation artemisinin artemisia annua major limitation
for production delivery malaria endemic areas world. while
several strategies enhance artemisinin extensively explored,
enhancing storage capacity trichome yet considered. therefore,
trichome density increased expression β-glucosidase (bgl1) gene
in a. annua agrobacterium-mediated transformation. transgene (bgl1)
integration transcript confirmed molecular analysis. trichome density
increased 20% leaves 66% flowers bgl1 transgenic plants than
artemisia control plants. high-performance liquid chromatography, time flight 
mass spectrometer data showed artemisinin content increased 1.4% in
leaf 2.56% flowers (per g dw), similar highest yields achieved so
far metabolic engineering. artemisinin enhanced five-fold in
bgl1 transgenic flowers. study opens possibility increasing
artemisinin content manipulating trichomes' density, major
reservoir artemisinin. combining biosynthetic pathway engineering with
enhancing trichome density may increase artemisinin yield a. annua.
because oral feeding artemisia plant cells reduced parasitemia more
efficiently purified drug, reduced drug resistance cost of
prohibitively expensive purification process, enhanced expression play a
key role making valuable drug affordable treat malaria large
global population disproportionally impacts low-socioeconomic areas and
underprivileged children.
