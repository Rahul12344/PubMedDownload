plasmodium falciparum (pf) prolyl-trna synthetase (prors) one few
chemical-genetically validated drug targets malaria, yet highly selective
inhibitors described. paper, approximately 40,000 compounds
were screened identify compounds selectively inhibit pfprors enzyme
activity versus homo sapiens (hs) prors. x-ray crystallography structures were
solved apo, well substrate- inhibitor-bound forms pfprors. we
identified two new inhibitors pfprors bind outside active site. these
two allosteric inhibitors showed >100 times specificity pfprors compared to
hsprors, demonstrating class compounds could overcome toxicity
related hsprors inhibition halofuginone analogues. initial
medicinal chemistry performed one two compounds, guided the
cocrystallography compound pfprors, results instruct
future medicinal chemistry work optimize promising new leads drug
development malaria.
