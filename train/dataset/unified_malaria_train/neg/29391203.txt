plasmodium falciparum cell-traversal protein ookinetes sporozoites
(pfceltos) reported one attractive malaria vaccine
candidate antigens. design broadly effective malaria vaccine based this
antigen, crucial adequate information genetic diversity in
global pfceltos. therefore, extent sequence diversity full-length
of pfceltos assessed among natural p. falciparum isolates collected 
from iran (n = 93) available global pfceltos sequence data retrieved
from plasmodb database (n = 159). also, recombination, natural selection, the
degree genetic differentiation well predicted immunodominant regions
in pfceltos analyzed. total, 40 snps (including 1 synonymous 39
non-synonymous) detected 34 positions, compared 3d7 sequence, which
led 66 distinct haplotypes different frequencies. among haplotypes,
34 (51.5%, excluded analysis) singleton haplotype mostly
detected among senegalese parasite isolates. pfcelt-1 found predominant
haplotype (32.6% total frequency) detected iranian p. falciparum
isolates. nucleotide diversity low french guiana (0.00236 ± 0.00203) and
iranian (0.00259 ± 0.00048) p. falciparum isolates comparison african
populations. evidence positive selection host immunity intragenic
recombination detected two key factors responsible gene
evolution genetic diversity pfceltos gene. results fst analysis and
haplotype network revealed pfceltos antigen displayed evident genetic
structure geographical parasite populations. conclusion, present
analysis demonstrates limited antigenic diversity geographic 
variation global pfceltos, finding may associated the
critical function antigen cell traversal parasite sporozoite
and ookinete. besides, predicted b- t-cell epitopes located 
in conserved region gene, amino acid replacements were
located c-terminal region pfceltos. obtained results this
investigation could provide knowledge better design pfceltos-based malaria
vaccine.
