background: among severe malaria syndromes, severe malarial anemia (sma) is
the common, whereas cerebral malaria (cm) lethal. however, the
mechanisms lead cm sma unclear.
methods: compared transcriptomic profiles whole blood obtained ugandan
children acute cm (n = 17) sma (n = 17) community children without
plasmodium falciparum infection (n = 12) determined relationships among
gene expression, hematological indices, relevant plasma biomarkers.
results: cm sma demonstrated predominantly upregulated enrichment of
dendritic cell activation, inflammatory/toll-like receptor/chemokines, and
monocyte modules, downregulated enrichment lymphocyte modules. nuclear
factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (nrf2)-regulated genes overexpressed children 
with sma relative cm, highest expression children sma
and sickle cell disease (hbss), corresponding elevated plasma heme
oxygenase-1 group. erythroid reticulocyte-specific signatures were
markedly decreased cm relative sma despite higher hemoglobin levels and
appropriate increases erythropoietin. viral sensing/interferon-regulatory
factor 2 module expression plasma interferon-inducible protein-10/cxcl10
negatively correlated reticulocyte-specific signatures.
conclusions: compared sma, cm associated downregulation of
nrf2-related erythropoiesis signatures whole-blood transcriptomics. future
studies needed confirm findings assess pathways may be
amenable interventions ameliorate cm sma.
