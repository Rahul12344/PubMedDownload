a new protein, termed apicortin, recently identified, occurs 
in placozoan animal trichoplax adhaerens genomes currently 
sequenced apicomplexan parasites (e.g., toxoplasma, plasmodium, etc.). apicortins
unite two conserved domains, dcx motif partial p25alpha sequence, which
are singly found diverse proteins, doublecortins tppps,
respectively. show although apicortin limited phylogenomic
distribution, occurrence broader thought previously. been
identified another primitive opisthokont, chytrid fungus, spizellomyces
punctatus. apicortins divided two subgroups: apicomplexan and
non-apicomplexan ones. main difference former ones possess a
long, n-terminal extension predicted disordered, missing the
other subgroup. appearance extension apicomplexan apicortins 
"innovation" phylum, may play functional role the
protein-protein interactions.
