the resistance plasmodium falciparum antimalarial drugs linked to
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). currently, methods the
identification resistant parasites sufficiently simple, cheap, and
fast enough performed point-of-care, i.e., local hospitals where
drugs prescribed. primer extension methods (pext) developed identify 
4 snps p. falciparum positioned amino acids 86, 184, 1246 p.
falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene (pfmdr1) amino acid 76 the
chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt). pext products were
visualized nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (nalfia) carbon
nanoparticles detection labels. pcr-pext-nalfias showed good correlation
to reference methods, quantitative pcr (qpcr) direct amplicon sequence
analysis, initial open-label evaluation 17 field samples. tests
were evaluated blind study design set 150 patient isolates. 
high specificities 98 100% found 4 pcr-pext genotyping assays.
the sensitivities ranged 75% 100% pext-positive tests were
considered. number samples low parasite density successfully
characterized reference methods failed generate result the
pcr-pext-nalfia, particularly samples microscopy-negative subpatent
infections. proof-of principle study validates use pcr-pext-nalfia
for detection resistance-associated mutations p. falciparum,
particularly microscopy-positive infections. although requires standard 
thermal cycler, procedure cheap rapid thus potentially valuable 
tool point-of-care detection developing countries.
