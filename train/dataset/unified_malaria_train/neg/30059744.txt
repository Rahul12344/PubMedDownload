plants platform recombinant protein expression economically
comparable well-established systems, microbes mammalian cells,
thanks advantages scalability product safety. however, downstream 
processing accounts majority final product costs plant
extracts contain large quantities host cell proteins (hcps) must be
removed using elaborate purification strategies. heat precipitation planta
(blanching) remove ∼80% hcps thus simplify purification steps,
but possible target protein thermostable. describe
a combination blanching chromatography purify thermostable
transmission-blocking malaria vaccine candidate fqs, transiently
expressed nicotiana benthamiana leaves. blanching temperature exceeded 
a critical threshold ∼75 °c, fqs longer recognized malaria
transmission-blocking monoclonal antibody 4b7. design-of-experiments approach
revealed reducing blanching temperature 80 °c 70 °c restored
antibody binding still precipitating hcps. also found that
blanching inhibited degradation fqs plant extracts, probably due the
thermal inactivation proteases. screened hydrophobic interaction
chromatography materials using miniature columns liquid-handling station.
octyl sepharose achieved highest fqs purity primary capture step
and led final purity ∼72% 60% recovery via step elution. found
that 30-75% fqs lost ultrafiltration/diafiltration, giving final
yield 9 mg kg-1 plant material purification based initial yield of
∼49 mg kg-1 biomass blanching.
