despite appropriate anti-malarial treatment, cerebral malaria (cm)-associated
mortalities remain high 30%. thus, adjunctive therapies urgently needed
to prevent reduce mortalities. overproduction cxcl10 subset cm
patients shown tightly associated fatal human cm. mice with
deleted cxcl10 gene partially protected experimental cerebral malaria
(ecm) mortality indicating importance cxcl10 pathogenesis cm.
however, direct effect increased cxcl10 production brain cells is
unknown. assessed apoptotic effects cxcl10 human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (hbvecs) neuroglia cells vitro. tested hypothesis
that reducing overexpression cxcl10 synthetic drug cm
pathogenesis increase survival reduce mortality. utilized
atorvastatin, widely used synthetic blood cholesterol-lowering drug that
specifically targets reduces plasma cxcl10 levels humans, determine the
effects atorvastatin artemether combination therapy murine ecm outcome.
we assessed effects atorvastatin treatment immune determinants severity,
survival, parasitemia ecm mice receiving combination therapy onset 
of ecm (day 6 9 post-infection) compared results controls. the
results indicate cxcl10 induces apoptosis hbvecs neuroglia cells a
dose-dependent manner suggesting increased levels cxcl10 cm patients
may play role vasculopathy, neuropathogenesis, brain injury cm
pathogenesis. treatment ecm mice atorvastatin significantly reduced
systemic brain inflammation reducing levels anti-angiogenic and
apoptotic factor (cxcl10) increasing angiogenic factor (vegf) production.
treatment combination atorvastatin artemether improved survival
(100%) compared artemether monotherapy (70%), p<0.05. thus,
adjunctively reducing cxcl10 levels inflammation atorvastatin treatment
during anti-malarial therapy may represent novel approach treating cm
patients.
