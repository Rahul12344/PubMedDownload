background: malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum auxotroph for
purines, required nucleic acid synthesis the
intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (idc) parasite. capabilities of
the parasite extent use compensatory mechanisms adapt to
purine deprivation studied examining changes metabolism under
sub-optimal concentrations hypoxanthine, primary precursor utilized the
parasite purine-based nucleic acid synthesis.
methods: concentration hypoxanthine caused moderate growth defect
over course one idc determined. concentration hypoxanthine 
(0.5 μm), transcriptomic metabolomic data collected one idc at
multiple time points. data integrated metabolic network model
of parasite embedded red blood cell (rbc) interpret metabolic
adaptation p. falciparum hypoxanthine deprivation.
results: hypoxanthine concentration 0.5 μm, vacuole-like structures in
the cytosol many p. falciparum parasites observed 24-h midpoint
of idc. parasites grown conditions experienced slowdown 
progression idc. 72 h deprivation, parasite growth could 
be recovered despite supplementation 90 µm hypoxanthine. simulations p.
falciparum metabolism suggested alterations ubiquinone, isoprenoid,
shikimate, mitochondrial metabolism occurred appearance these
vacuole-like structures. alterations found metabolic reactions associated
with fatty acid synthesis, pentose phosphate pathway, methionine metabolism, 
and coenzyme synthesis latter half idc. furthermore, gene set
enrichment analysis revealed p. falciparum activated genes associated with
rosette formation, maurer's cleft protein export two different
nutrient-deprivation conditions (hypoxanthine isoleucine).
conclusions: metabolic network analysis presented suggests p.
falciparum invokes specific purine-recycling pathways compensate for
hypoxanthine deprivation maintains hypoxanthine pool purine-based
nucleic acid synthesis. however, compensatory mechanism sufficient to
maintain long-term viability parasite. although p. falciparum complete
a full idc low hypoxanthine conditions, subsequent cycles disrupted.
