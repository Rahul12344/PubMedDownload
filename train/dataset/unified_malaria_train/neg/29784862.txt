plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) mediates parasite
sequestration cerebral microvasculature via binding dblβ domains to
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam1) associated severe cerebral 
malaria. cohort 187 young children papua new guinea (png), we
examined baseline levels antibody icam1-binding pfemp1 domain,
dblβ3pf11_0521, comparison four control antigens, including nts-dblα and
cidr1 domains another group variant group b/c variant. antibody
levels group antigens strongly associated age exposure.
antibody responses dblβ3pf11_0521 associated 37% reduced risk of
high-density clinical malaria follow-up period (adjusted incidence risk
ratio [airr] = 0.63 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 0.45 0.88; p = 0.007]) 
a 25% reduction risk low-density clinical malaria (airr = 0.75 [95% ci,
0.55 1.01; p = 0.06]), association variants.
children experienced severe malaria also significantly lower levels of
antibody dblβ3pf11_0521 group domains that
experienced nonsevere malaria. furthermore, subset png dblβ sequences had
icam1-binding motifs, formed distinct phylogenetic cluster, similar to
sequences areas endemicity. pfemp1 variants associated these
dblβ domains enriched dc4 dc13 head structures implicated in
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) binding severe malaria, suggesting
conservation dual binding specificities. results provide support
for development specific classes pfemp1 vaccine candidates as
biomarkers protective immunity clinical p. falciparum malaria.
