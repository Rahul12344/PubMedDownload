background: early recognition bacterial infections crucial proper
management, particularly difficult children severe acute
malnutrition (sam). objectives study evaluate accuracy of
c-reactive protein (crp) procalcitonin (pct) diagnosing bacterial
infections assessing prognosis hospitalized children sam, 
determine reliability crp pct rapid tests suitable remote
settings.
methods: november 2007 july 2008, prospectively recruited 311 children
aged 6 59 months hospitalized sam plus medical complication maradi, 
niger. blood, urine, stool cultures chest radiography performed
systematically admission. crp pct measured rapid tests by
reference quantitative methods using frozen serum sent reference laboratory.
results: median crp pct levels higher children bacteremia or
pneumonia proven bacterial infection (p < .002). however,
both markers performed poorly identifying invasive bacterial infection, with
areas curve 0.64 0.67 excluding children with
malaria, respectively. threshold 40 mg/l, crp best predictor of
death (81% sensitivity, 58% specificity). rapid test results consistent with
those reference methods.
conclusions: crp pct sufficiently accurate diagnosing invasive
bacterial infections population hospitalized children complicated
sam. however, rapid crp test could useful settings identify
children risk dying.
