background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency associated
with protection severe malaria, potentially uncomplicated malaria
phenotypes. documented g6pd deficiency sub-saharan africa 
due 202a/376g g6pd a-allele, association studies used genotyping 
as convenient technique epidemiological studies. however, recent studies
have shown discrepancies g6pd202/376 associations severe malaria. there
is evidence suggest g6pd deficiency alleles may common some
regions west africa, allelic heterogeneity could explain these
discrepancies.
methods: cross-sectional epidemiological study malaria susceptibility was
conducted 2006 2007 sahel meso-endemic malaria zone mali.
the study included dogon (n = 375) fulani (n = 337) sympatric ethnic groups, 
where latter group characterized lower susceptibility plasmodium
falciparum malaria. fifty-three g6pd polymorphisms, including 202/376, were
genotyped across 712 samples. evidence association g6pd
polymorphisms mild malaria assessed ethnic groups using genotypic
and haplotypic statistical tests.
results: confirmed fulani less susceptible malaria, and
the 202a mutation rare group (<1% versus dogon 7.9%). betica-selma
968c/376g (~11% enzymatic activity) common fulani (6.1% vs dogon
0.0%). differences haplotype frequencies dogon fulani,
and association analysis reveal strong evidence protective g6pd
genetic effects uncomplicated malaria ethnic groups gender.
however, evidence increased risk mild malaria dogon 
the 202a mutation, attaining borderline statistical significance females. 
rs915942 polymorphism found associated asymptomatic malaria in
dogon females, rs61042368 polymorphism associated clinical
malaria fulani males.
conclusions: results highlight need consider markers addition to
g6pd202 studies deficiency. further, large genetic epidemiological studies 
of multi-ethnic groups west africa across spectrum malaria severity
phenotypes required establish receives protection g6pd
deficiency.
