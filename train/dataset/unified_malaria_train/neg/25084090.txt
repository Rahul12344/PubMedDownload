the malaria parasite plasmodium vivax known majorly endemic asian and
latin american countries reports africans infected with
this parasite. since human duffy antigens act receptors p. vivax to
invade human rbcs africans generally duffy-negative, non-endemicity p.
vivax africa attributed fact. however, recent reports
describing p. vivax infections duffy-negative africans west central
parts africa surfaced including recent report p. vivax
infection native cameroonians. order know cameroonians living 
southern regions also susceptible p. vivax infection, collected
finger-prick blood samples 485 malarial symptomatic patients five
locations followed pcr diagnostic assays dna sequencing 18s
ribosomal rna gene. 201 malaria positive cases detected, 193 pure
p. falciparum, six pure p. vivax two mixed parasite infections (p. falciparum
+ p. vivax). eight p. vivax infected samples (six single + two mixed) were
further subjected dna sequencing p. vivax multidrug resistance 1
(pvmdr1) p.vivax circumsporozoite (pvcsp) genes. alignment eight
cameroonian pvmdr1 sequences reference sequence showed high sequence
similarities, reconfirming p. vivax infection eight patients. dna
sequencing pvcsp gene indicated eight p. vivax vk247
type. interestingly, dna sequencing part human duffy gene covering
the promoter region eight p. vivax-infected cameroonians identify the
t-33c mutation revealed patients duffy-negative. results provide
evidence single p. vivax well mixed malaria parasite infection native
cameroonians add knowledge growing evidences p. vivax infection 
duffy-negative africans.
