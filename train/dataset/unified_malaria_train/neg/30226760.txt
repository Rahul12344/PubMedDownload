rapid specific detection single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) related to
drug resistance infectious diseases crucial accurate prognostics,
therapeutics disease management point-of-care. here, present novel
amplification method provide universal guidelines detection snps
at isothermal conditions. method, called uss-sblamp, consists snp-based
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (sblamp) primers unmodified
self-stabilizing (uss) competitive primers robustly delay prevent
unspecific amplification. sets primers incorporated same
reaction mixture, always targeting different alleles; one set specific the
wild type allele mutant allele. mechanism action
relies thermodynamically favored hybridization totally complementary
primers, enabling allele-specific amplification. successfully validate our
method detecting snps, c580y y493h, plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 
gene responsible resistance artemisinin-based combination
therapies currently used globally treatment malaria. uss-sblamp primers
can efficiently discriminate snps high sensitivity (limit of
detection 5 Ã— 101 copies per reaction), efficiency, specificity rapidness 
(<35 min) capability quantitative measurements point-of-care
diagnosis, treatment guidance, epidemiological reporting drug-resistance.
