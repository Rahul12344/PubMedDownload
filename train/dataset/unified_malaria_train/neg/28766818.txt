island populations vulnerable introduced pathogens, evidenced by
extinction population decline several endemic hawaiian birds caused 
malaria parasite, plasmodium relictum (order haemosporida). analyzed blood
samples 363 birds caught near guantánamo bay, cuba, presence of
haemosporidian infections. characterized parasite lineages determining
nucleotide variation parasite's mitochondrial cyt b gene. fifty-nine
individuals infected, identified 7 lineages haemosporidian
parasites. fifty individuals infected 6 haemoproteus sp. lineages,
including newly characterized lineage haem. (parahaemoproteus) sp. cuh01.
nine individuals carried p. relictum lineage grw4, including 5 endemic cuban 
grassquits (tiaris canorus) 1 migratory cape may warbler (setophaga tigrina).
a sequence merozoite surface protein gene one cuban grassquit
infected grw4 matched hawaiian haplotype pr9. results
indicate resident migratory cuban birds infected malaria
lineage severely affected populations several endemic hawaiian birds.
we suggest grw4 may associated lack several bird species cuba
that ubiquitous elsewhere west indies. standpoint avian
conservation caribbean basin, important determine the
distribution haemosporidian parasites, especially p. relictum grw4, cuba as
well pathogenicity lineage species occur absent
from cuba.
