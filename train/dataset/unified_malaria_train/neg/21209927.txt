background: antimalarial interventions designed impact transmissible
sexual stages plasmodium falciparum evaluated measurement peripheral
gametocyte carriage vivo infectivity mosquitoes. drug or
vaccine-elicited effects may differentially affect relative abundance of
mature male female sexual forms, measured estimation of
sex ratios intervention vivo vitro. measuring the
impact anti-gametocyte drugs sexual commitment immature gametocyte
stages vitro currently possible male female parasites cannot 
distinguished morphology alone prior stage iv.
methodology/principal findings: modified existing
immunofluorescence-based approach distinguishing male female gametocytes 
during development vitro, using highly synchronised magnetically-enriched
gametocyte preparations different stages maturity. antibodies recognising
α-tubulin ii (males) pfg377 (females) used attempt discriminate
the sexes. transcription two proteins coordinated in
vitro development, pfg377 transcripts accumulating late development,
immediately prior immunofluorescent signals pfg377 protein appearing 
in stage iv gametocytes. contrary previous descriptions protein as
male-specific p. falciparum, α-tubulin ii recognised male female
gametocytes stages iv, evidence differential expression levels 
this protein late stage male female gametocytes found. using
antibodies recognising pfg377 primary marker α-tubulin ii a
secondary marker, robust estimates sex ratio vitro cultures were
obtained gametocytes stage iv later, validated light microscopic
counts. however, sex ratio estimation possible early stage
gametocytes due promiscuity α-tubulin ii protein expression, the
relatively late accumulation pfg377 development process.
conclusions/significance: approach feasible method evaluation
of drug impacts late-stage gametocyte sex ratio vitro studies.
additional sex-specific antigens need evaluated sex ratio estimation in
early stage gametocyte preparations.
