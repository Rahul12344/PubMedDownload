the mosquito complement-like system major defense mechanism limits
plasmodium infection. ookinete midgut invasion results irreversible damage 
invaded cells triggers epithelial nitration complement activation.
several lines evidence suggest hemocytes participate early
antiplasmodial responses target ookinetes, role remains unclear.
the fate hemocytes response plasmodium infection investigated by
labeling cell population vivo. found midgut nitration triggers
the local release hemocyte-derived microvesicles (hdmv) basal
labyrinth midgut. several different strategies, gene silencing,
immune priming, systemic injection polystyrene beads, used either
enhance reduce hdmv release. provide direct experimental evidence that
contact hemocytes nitrated midgut basal surface triggers hdmv release
and response necessary effective activation mosquito
complement. studies suggest hemocyte-derived microvesicles may deliver
some critical factor(s) promote activation thioester-containing protein
1, key effector mosquito antiplasmodial immunity.
