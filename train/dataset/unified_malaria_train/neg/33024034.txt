plasmodium parasites related apicomplexans contain essential "complex
plastid" organelle secondary endosymbiotic origin, apicoplast. biogenesis 
of complex plastid poses unique challenge requiring evolution new
cellular machinery. previously conducted mutagenesis screen essential
apicoplast biogenesis genes discover organellar pathways evolutionary and
biomedical significance. validate characterize gene candidate 
our screen, pf3d7_0913500. using conditional knockdown strain, show that
pf3d7_0913500 depletion causes growth inhibition rescued sole
essential product apicoplast, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp), results
in apicoplast loss. pf3d7_0913500 previous functional annotation, 
we name apicoplast-minus ipp-rescued 4 (amr4). amr4 annotated caax
protease bacteriocin processing (cpbp) domain, eukaryotes typically 
indicates role caax postprenylation processing. indeed, amr4 only
putative caax-like protease plasmodium parasites known require
protein prenylation, confirm conserved catalytic residue amr4 
(e352) required apicoplast function. however, unexpectedly find
that amr4 act caax postprenylation processing pathway plasmodium
falciparum instead, find amr4 imported apicoplast is
derived cyanobacterial cpbp gene retained primary
and secondary endosymbiosis. findings suggest amr4 true caax
protease, instead performs conserved, uncharacterized chloroplast
function retained complex plastid biogenesis.importance
plasmodium parasites, cause malaria, related apicomplexans are
important human veterinary pathogens. parasites represent highly
divergent understudied branch eukaryotes, often defy the
expectations set model organisms. one striking example unique apicomplexan 
biology apicoplast, essential nonphotosynthetic plastid derived
from unusual secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis. endosymbioses 
a major driver cellular innovation, apicoplast biogenesis pathways
represent hot spot molecular evolution. previously conducted unbiased
screen apicoplast biogenesis genes p. falciparum uncover these
essential innovative pathways. here, validate novel gene candidate 
our screen show role apicoplast biogenesis match its
functional annotation predicted model eukaryotes. findings suggest an
uncharacterized chloroplast maintenance pathway reused complex
plastid biogenesis divergent branch pathogens.
