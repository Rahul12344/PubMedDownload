cercarial dermatitis, also known swimmer's itch, allergenic skin
reaction followed intense itching caused schistosome cercariae penetrating 
human skin. cercarial dermatitis outbreaks occur globally frequently
associated freshwater lakes occasionally associated marine or
estuarine waters birds reside year-round migratory birds reside.
in study, broadly reactive taqman assay targeting 18s rrna gene (ribosomal
dna [rdna]) sequences based genetically diverse panel of
schistosome isolates representing 13 genera 20 species (the 18s rdna taqman
assay) developed. pcr assay also developed amplify 28s rdna region
for subsequent sequencing identify schistosomes. applied surface water
samples seeded schistosoma mansoni cercariae, 18s rdna taqman assay
enabled detection level 5 s. mansoni cercariae 100 liters lake
water. 18s rdna taqman 28s rdna pcr sequencing assays also applied
to 100-liter water samples collected lakes nebraska wisconsin where
there reported dermatitis outbreaks. avian schistosome dna detected in
11 34 lake water samples using taqman assay. 28s rdna sequence
analysis positive samples confirmed presence avian schistosome dna 
provided preliminary identification avian schistosomes 10 11
samples. data indicate broadly schistosome-reactive taqman assay
can effective rapid screening large-volume water samples detection 
of avian schistosomes, thereby facilitating timely response actions mitigate
or prevent dermatitis outbreaks. additionally, samples positive 18s rdna
taqman assay assayed using 28s rdna sequencing assay both
confirm presence schistosomes contribute identification.
