background: endosymbiont bacterium wolbachia maternally inherited and
naturally infects filarial nematodes diverse range arthropods,
including mosquito vectors responsible disease transmission humans.
previously, found infecting mosquito species absent in
anopheles aedes aegypti. however, recently two mosquito species were
found naturally infected wolbachia. report extent of
wolbachia infections field-collected mosquitoes malaysia based pcr
amplification wolbachia wsp 16s rrna genes.
methods: prevalence wolbachia culicinae mosquitoes assessed via pcr
with wsp primers. mosquitoes, wsp primers failed 
amplify product, wolbachia screening performed using nested pcr targeting
the 16s rrna gene. wolbachia sequences aligned using geneious 9.1.6
software, analyzed blast, similar sequences downloaded.
phylogenetic analyses carried mega 7.0 software. graphs drawn 
with graphpad prism 8.0 software.
results: total 217 adult mosquitoes representing 26 mosquito species were
screened. these, infections wolbachia detected 4 15 mosquito 
species using wsp 16s rrna primers, respectively. knowledge, is
the first time wolbachia detected using 16s rrna gene amplification, 
anopheles species (some infected plasmodium), culex sinensis, culex vishnui,
culex pseudovishnui, mansonia bonneae mansonia annulifera. phylogenetic
analysis based wsp revealed wolbachia mosquitoes belonged 
wolbachia supergroup b. based 16s rrna phylogenetic analysis, wolbachia
strain anopheles mosquitoes closely related wolbachiaÂ infecting
anopheles africa myanmar.
conclusions: wolbachia found infecting anopheles important disease 
vectors mansonia. since wolbachia affect host reducing the
life span provide resistance pathogen infection, several studies have
suggested potential innovative tool vector/vector-borne disease
control. therefore, important carry studies natural
wolbachia infection vector mosquitoes' populations well long-term 
effects new hosts pathogen suppression.
