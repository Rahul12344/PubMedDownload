hmip-2 human quantitative trait locus affecting peripheral numbers, size and
hemoglobin composition red blood cells, marked effect the
persistence fetal form hemoglobin, hbf, adults. locus consists
of multiple common variants enhancer region myb (chr 6q23.3), which
encodes hematopoietic transcription factor cmyb. studying european
population cohort four african-descended groups patients sickle cell 
anemia, found share set two spatially separate hbf-promoting
alleles hmip-2, termed "a" "b." typically occurred together ("a-b") 
on european chromosomes, existed separate homologous chromosomes in
africans. using haplotype signatures "a" "b," interrogated public
population datasets. haplotypes carrying "a" "b" typical for
populations sub-saharan africa. "a-b" combination frequent in
european, asian, amerindian populations. alleles infrequent in
tropical regions, possibly undergoing negative selection geographical factors,
as reported malaria hematological traits. propose that
the ascertainment worldwide distribution patterns common, hbf-promoting
alleles aid genetic characterization, including the
investigation gene-environment interaction human migration and
adaptation.
