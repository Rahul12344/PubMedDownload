in certain cases, species may access important genetic variation
present related species via adaptive introgression. novel alleles may 
interact new genetic background, resulting unexpected phenotypes.
in study, describe selective sweep standing variation x
chromosome mosquito anopheles coluzzii, principal malaria vector west
africa. event may influenced recent adaptive introgression 
of insecticide resistance gene known kdr sister species anopheles
gambiae. individuals carrying kdr nearly fixed x-linked haplotype,
encompassing least four genes including p450 gene cyp9k1 cuticular
protein cpr125, rapidly increased relative frequency. parallel, a
reproductively isolated insecticide-susceptible a. gambiae population (bamako
form) driven local extinction, likely due strong selection from
increased insecticide-treated bed net usage.
