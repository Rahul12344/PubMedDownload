background: plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 2b
(pfrh2b) invasion ligand potential blood-stage vaccine candidate 
antigen; however, naturally occurring deletion within immunogenic domain 
present high frequencies africa associated alternative
invasion pathway usage. standardized tools provide antigenic specificity 
in vitro assays needed functionally assess neutralizing potential of
humoral responses malaria vaccine candidate antigens.
methods: transgenic parasite lines generated express pfrh2b deletion.
total immunoglobulin g (igg) individuals residing malaria-endemic regions
in tanzania, senegal, mali used growth inhibition assays with
transgenic parasite lines.
results: pfrh2b deletion transgenic line showed change invasion
pathway utilization compared wild-type absence specific
antibodies, outgrew wild-type controls competitive growth experiments.
inhibition differences total igg observed different endemic
sites, ranging allele-specific inhibition allele-independent inhibitory
immune responses.
conclusions: pfrh2b deletion may allow parasite escape neutralizing
antibody responses regions. difference geographical inhibition
was revealed using transgenic methodologies, provide valuable tools for
functionally assessing neutralizing antibodies vaccine-candidate antigens
in regions varying malaria endemicity.
