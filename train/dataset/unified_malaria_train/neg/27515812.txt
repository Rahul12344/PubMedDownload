artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (as+sp) artemether+lumefantrine (al) are
the first- second line treatments, respectively, treatment of
falciparum infections dihydroartemsinin+piperaquine (dha+ppq) potential 
candidate case as+sp al fails pakistan. therapeutic efficacies of
as+sp (5 sites 2007, 2 sites 2011 2 sites 2012), al (2 sites in
2012) dha+ppq (2 sites 2015) evaluated seven sentinel sites.
clinical parasitological outcomes evaluated among eligible patients.
mutations p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes investigated. pcr correction, 98.5-100%
adequate clinical parasitological response (acpr) as+sp 98.8-100%
acpr al observed day 28, well 100% acpr day 42 for
dha+ppq. prevalences mutants dhfr s108n (100%) c59r (98%-100%) reached
or near fixation. double dhfr (c59r/s108n) mutant dominant
(96%-100%) sites. triple dhfr (n51i/c59r/s108n) mutant rare
(1.1%-2.3%). prevalence dhps a437g varied 38% 70%. a
combination triple dhfr/dhps (c59r/s108n+a437g n51i/s108n+a437g) mutants
was observed (38%-69%). quadruple dhfr/dhps (n51i/c59r/s108n+a437g) mutation
was rare quintuple (n51i/c59r/s108n+a437g/k540e) mutations were
detected. as+sp remains highly effective pakistan. however, molecular data
indicate sp resistance established, although mutations confer 
a high risk sp treatment failure rare non-existent. underscores
the need close monitoring vivo as+sp efficacy dhfr dhps
mutations inform national treatment policy. trial registration numbers:
