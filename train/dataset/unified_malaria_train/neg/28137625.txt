the 175-kda erythrocyte binding antigen (eba-175) malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum important invasion human erythrocytes. 
primary structure eba-175 divided seven regions, namely vii.
region iii contains highly divergent dimorphic segments, termed fseg cseg.
the allele frequencies segmental dimorphism within p. falciparum population 
have extensively examined; however, molecular evolution segmental
dimorphism well understood. comprehensive comparison nucleotide
sequences among 32 p. falciparum eba-175 alleles identified previous
study, two plasmodium reichenowi, one p. gaboni orthologous alleles obtained 
from genbank database conducted uncover origin evolutionary
processes segmental dimorphism p. falciparum eba-175. eba-175
nucleotide sequence derived p. reichenowi cdc strain, fseg cseg
were found region iii, implies original eba-175 gene both
segments, deletions f- c-segments generated cseg fseg alleles,
respectively. also confirmed presence allele fseg cseg in
another p. reichenowi strain (sy57), re-mapping short reads obtained 
genbank database. hand, segmental sequence eba-175 ortholog
in p. gaboni quite diverged species, suggesting 
the original eba-175 dimorphism p. falciparum traced back stem
linage p. falciparum p. reichenowi. findings suggest fseg and
cseg alleles derived single eba-175 allele containing segments in
the ancestral population p. falciparum p. reichenowi, allelic
dimorphism eba-175 shaped independent emergence similar
dimorphic lineage different species never observed any
evolutionary mode allelic dimorphism loci malaria genomes.
