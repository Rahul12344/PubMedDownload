babesia bovis, intra-erythrocytic tick-borne apicomplexan protozoan, one of
the causative agents bovine babesiosis. life cycle includes sexual
reproduction within cattle fever ticks, rhipicephalus spp. six b. bovis 6-cys
gene superfamily members previously identified (a, b, c, d, e, f) where
their orthologues plasmodium parasite shown encode proteins
required development sexual stages. current study identified four 
additional 6-cys genes (g, h, i, j) b. bovis genome. four genes 
described context complete ten 6-cys gene superfamily. proteins
expressed gene family predicted secreted surface membrane
directed. genetic analysis comparing 6-cys superfamily among five distinct b.
bovis strains shows limited sequence variation. additionally, a, b, e, h, j
genes transcribed b. bovis infected tick midgut genes a, b e
were also transcribed subsequent b. bovis kinete stage. transcription of
gene c found exclusively kinete. contrast, transcription genes
d, f g either b. bovis infected midguts kinetes detected. none 
of 6-cys transcripts detected b. bovis blood stages. subsequent
protein analysis 6-cys b concordant transcript profile.
the collective data indicate plasmodium parasite, certain b. bovis 6-cys
family members uniquely expressed sexual stages therefore, they
are likely required parasite reproduction. within b. bovis specifically,
proteins encoded 6-cys genes b markers sexual stages and
candidate antigens developing novel vaccines able interfere the
development b. bovis within tick vector.
