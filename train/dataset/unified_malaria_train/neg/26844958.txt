both invasion red blood cells (rbcs) plasmodium falciparum parasites
and sequestration parasite-infected rbcs microvasculature are
mediated part complement receptor one (cr1). rbc surface cr1 level vary
between individuals 20-fold may associated risk of
severe malaria. factors influence rbc cr1 level variation poorly
understood, particularly african populations. studied 3535 child residents 
of malaria-endemic region coastal kenya report, first time, that
the cr1 knops blood group alleles sl2 mcc(b), homozygous hbss are
positively associated rbc cr1 level. sickle cell trait abo blood group
did influence rbc cr1 level. also confirm previous observation that
α(+)thalassaemia associated reduced rbc cr1 level, possibly due small 
rbc volume, age-related changes rbc cr1 expression occur throughout
childhood. rbc cr1 level malaria-endemic african populations complex
phenotype influenced multiple factors taken account the
design interpretation future studies cr1 malaria susceptibility.
