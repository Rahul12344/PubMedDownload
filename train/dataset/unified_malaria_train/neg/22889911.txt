malaria parasites belong ancient lineage diverged early 
main branch eukaryotes. approximately 90-member plasmodial kinome includes
a majority eukaryotic protein kinases clearly cluster within agc,
cmgc, tkl, camk ck1 groups found yeast, plants mammals, testifying 
the ancient ancestry families. however, several hundred millions years
of independent evolution, specific pressures brought first a
photosynthetic parasitic lifestyle, led emergence unique
features plasmodial kinome. include taxon-restricted kinase
families, unique peculiarities individual enzymes even have
homologues eukaryotes. here, merge essential aspects three
malaria-related communications presented evolution protein
phosphorylation meeting, propose integrated discussion specific
features parasite's kinome phosphoproteome.
