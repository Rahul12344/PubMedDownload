background: dirofilaria repens recently d. immitis known be
endemic hungary. one several recent cases, fatal case dog
infested d. immitis szeged, southern hungary, received attention the
media. hence decided catch mosquitoes garden dog lived
to screen filarioid helminths plasmodium spp. using molecular tools.
methods: mosquitoes caught szeged, garden infected dog
was kept, july 2013 m-360 electric mosquito traps stored in
ethanol procedure. female mosquitoes classified genus level
by morphology. mosquito homogenized analyzed filarioid helminths
and avian malaria using standardized pcr techniques. positive mosquito samples
were identified species level comparing section the
mitochondrial coi gene genbank® entries.
results: study, 267 blood-fed mosquitoes caught july 2013 in
szeged. subsequent molecular screening revealed d. immitis was
present analyzed specimens also dna d. repens, setaria tundra and
plasmodium spp. confirmed.
conclusions: analysis blood-fed mosquitoes diagnosis of
dirofilaria spp. mosquito-borne pathogens seems adequate
technique evaluate filarioid helminths present certain area.
usually unfed female mosquitoes analyzed epidemiological studies.
however, blood-fed mosquitoes used screening pathogen is
present role mosquito vector cannot classified (blood of
bitten host). furthermore, setaria tundra confirmed first time in
hungary.
