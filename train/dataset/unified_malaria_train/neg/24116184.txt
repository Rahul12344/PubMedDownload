apolipoprotein e monomeric protein secreted liver responsible for
the transport plasma cholesterol triglycerides. apoe gene encodes 3
isoforms ɛ4, ɛ3 ɛ2 apoe ɛ4 associated higher plasma cholesterol
levels increased pathogenesis several infectious diseases (hiv, hsv).
given cholesterol important nutrient malaria parasites, we
examined whether apoe ɛ4 risk factor plasmodium infection, terms 
prevalence parasite density. cross sectional survey performed 508
children aged 1 12 years gabon wet season. children were
screened plasmodium spp. infection, apoe hemoglobin (hbs)
polymorphisms. median parasite densities significantly higher apoe ɛ4
children plasmodium spp. densities compared non-apoe ɛ4 children. when
stratified hbs polymorphisms, median plasmodium spp. densities were
significantly higher hbaa children apoe ɛ4 allele compared to
those without apoe ɛ4 allele. considering non-apoe ɛ4 children, was
no quantitative reduction plasmodium spp. parasite densities hbas compared
to hbaa phenotypes. influence apoe ɛ4 successful plasmodium liver cell
invasion detected multiplicity infection. results show the
apoe ɛ4 allele associated higher median malaria parasite densities in
children likely due importance cholesterol availability parasite
growth replication. results suggest epistatic interaction apoe and
hbs genes sickle cell trait effect parasite density in
apoe ɛ4 children. suggests linked pathway regulation parasite
density involving expression genes. findings significance for
understanding host determinants regulation malaria parasite density, the
design clinical trials well studies co-infection plasmodium 
other pathogens.
