in nepal, plasmodium vivax accounts approximately 80-90% malaria
cases, limited studies conducted genetic diversity this
parasite population. study carried determine genetic
diversity p. vivax population sampled subjects living endemic area 
of jhapa district analyzing polymorphic merozoite surface protein-3alpha
(pvmsp-3alpha) gene using pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism. three 
distinct genotypes obtained 96 samples; type a: 40 (71%), type b: 7
(13%), type c: 9 (16%) could categorized 13 allelic patterns:
a1-a9, b1, b2, c1 c2. results indicated high genetic diversity within
the studied p. vivax population. transmission rate malaria low in
nepal, diversity likely due migration people the
malaria endemic regions, either within country nepal india.
similar prevalence three genotypes pvmsp-3alpha two
countries likely supports latter explanation.
