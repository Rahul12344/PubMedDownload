aedes aegypti ae. albopictus among important vectors of
arboviral diseases, worldwide. recent studies indicate diverse midgut
microbiota mosquitoes significantly affect development, digestion, metabolism,
and immunity hosts. midgut microbiota also suggested to
modulate competency mosquitoes transmit arboviruses, malaria parasites 
etc. interestingly, midgut microbial flora dynamic diversity
changes development vectors, addition factors as
species, sex, life-stage, feeding behavior geographical origin. aim of
the present study investigate midgut bacterial diversity among larva, 
adult male, sugar fed female blood fed female ae. albopictus collected from
tezpur, northeastern india. based colony morphological characteristics, we
selected 113 cultivable bacterial isolates 16s rrna gene sequence based
molecular identification. 113 isolates, could identify 35 bacterial
species belonging 18 distinct genera four major phyla, namely
proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria bacteroidetes. phyla
proteobacteria firmicutes accounted majority (80%) species, 
phylum actinobacteria constituted 17% species. bacteroidetes least
represented phylum, characterized single species- chryseobacterium
rhizoplanae, isolated blood fed individuals. dissection midgut microbiota
diversity different developmental stages ae. albopictus helpful 
better understanding mosquito-borne diseases, designing effective
strategies manage mosquito-borne diseases.
