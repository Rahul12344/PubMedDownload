background: china made progress malaria control aims eliminate
malaria nationwide, implementing effective interventions along border
regions remain huge task. plasmodium falciparum cases imported from
southeast asia frequently reported especially china-myanmar border
(cmb) area. though, information scant p. falciparum genetic variability 
this area.
methods: study reported p. falciparum isolates genome sequence six
clinical isolates cmb area. furthermore, estimated nucleotide
diversity, watterson's estimator tajima's value whole genome
mutation rate slide window.
results: data aligned onto 96.05-98.61% reference 3d7 genome in
high fold coverages. principal component analysis result showed p.
falciparum clustered generally according geographic origin. total of
91 genes identified positive selection ka/ks ratio significantly
higher 1, multigene families encoding variant surface 
antigens (vsas) var, rif stevor. enrichment positive
selection vsa genes implied environment complexity subjected cmb's p.
falciparum pressure survival.
conclusions: research suggests greater genetic diversity cmb area and
the positive selection signals vsa genes, allow p. falciparum fit the
host immune system well aggravate difficulty treatment. meanwhile,
results obtained study provide fundamental basis p.
falciparum population genomic research cmb area.
