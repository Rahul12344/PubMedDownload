recent studies demonstrated subpopulation neutrophils express 
tcrαβ combinatorial immunoreceptor humans mice. here, report a
plasmodium berghei anka murine malaria infection induces expansion tcrβ
expressing cd11b+ ly6g+ neutrophils spleen early phase of
infection. measurement tcrβ transcript protein levels neutrophils in
wild-type versus nude rag1 knockout mice establishes observed
expression consequence nonspecific antibody staining passive
receptor expression due phagocytosis trogocytosis peripheral cells.
remarkably, day 3 postinfection, observed highly significant correlation 
between proportion neutrophils express tcrβ peripheral blood
parasite burden. addition, tcrβ+ neutrophils phagocytose parasitized
erythrocytes 4-fold greater efficiency tcrβ- neutrophils. together
these results signify tcr expression neutrophil plays important
role regulation parasite burden enhancing phagocytic capacity of
the neutrophil.
