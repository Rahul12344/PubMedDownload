the successful navigation malaria parasites life cycle, which
alternates vertebrate hosts mosquito vectors, requires complex
interplay metabolite synthesis salvage pathways. using rodent parasite
plasmodium berghei, explored synthesis scavenging pathways for
lipoic acid, short-chain fatty acid derivative regulates activity of
α-ketoacid dehydrogenases including pyruvate dehydrogenase. plasmodium, lipoic
acid either synthesized de novo apicoplast scavenged the
host mitochondrion. data show sporozoites lacking the
apicoplast lipoic acid protein ligase lipb markedly attenuated their
infectivity mice, vitro studies document late liver stage
arrest shortly final phase intra-hepaticparasite maturation.
lipb-deficient asexual blood stage parasites show unimpaired rates growth in
normal vitro vivo conditions. however, parasites showed reduced
growth lipid-restricted conditions induced treatment lipoic acid
analogue 8-bromo-octanoate lipid-reducing agent clofibrate. this
finding implications understanding plasmodium pathogenesis in
malnourished children bear brunt malarial disease. study also
highlights potential exploiting lipid metabolism pathways design
of genetically attenuated sporozoite vaccines.
