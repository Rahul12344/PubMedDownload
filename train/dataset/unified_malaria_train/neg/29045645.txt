background: malaria endemic french guiana (fg), south america. despite 
decrease cases local population, illegal gold miners affected 
by malaria (22.3% carried plasmodium spp.). self-medication seems be
very common, modalities associated factors studied. the
aim study evaluate parasite susceptibility drugs to
document behaviours could contribute resistance selection illegal gold
miners.
methods: multicentric cross-sectional study conducted resting sites
along fg-surinamese border. participating gold miners working fg completed
a questionnaire provided blood sample.
results: january june 2015, 421 illegal gold miners included. most
were brazilian (93.8%) 70.5% male. recent malaria
attack, 45.5% reported tested malaria 52.4% self-medicated,
mainly artemisinin derivatives (90%). fg last malaria
attack main factor associated self-medication (adjusted or = 22.1). 
this suggests access malaria diagnosis fg particularly difficult
for brazilian illegal gold miners. treatment adherence better persons who
reported tested. none 32 samples plasmodium falciparum
presented mutation pfk13 gene, one isolate showed resistance
profile artemisinin derivatives vitro.
conclusions: risk factors selection resistance well known 
this study showed present fg persons self-medicated
with poor adherence. interventions implemented among specific
population avoid emergence artemisinin resistance.
