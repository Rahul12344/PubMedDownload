background: sensitive diagnostic techniques needed timely detection of
malaria parasite disease control. molecular diagnostic techniques involving
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) 18 s rrna known diagnostic target 
an overall sensitivity 10 parasites per microliter used gold standard.
till date, attempt undertaken develop technique the
identification four plasmodium species single step pcr combined with
restriction digestion enzymes.
method: plasmodium species-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assays developed, based rflp
of amplified pcr product mitochondrial gene target. approach
identifies plasmodium species two steps involving amplification of
mitochondrial (mt) gene pcr followed digestion restriction enzymes.
result: total 36 clinical samples subjected pcr-rflp the
diagnosis detection malaria parasites targeting mitochondrial gene (mt).
the findings method compared gold standard methods (microscopy, 
rdts nested pcr) able detect mixed infection sensitivity of
100% specificity 93.8% respect nested pcr. results obtained by
pcr-rflp validated sanger sequencing (n = 32) found be
consistent method.
conclusion: method identifies distinguishes four species human
malaria parasite namely p. falciparum (pf), p. vivax (pv), p. malariae (pm) and
p. ovale (po) approximately 4 h. overcome address pcr difficulties,
continuous efforts needed development newer diagnostic techniques.
