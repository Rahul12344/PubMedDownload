plasmodium infection anopheles influenced mosquito-derived factors. we
previously showed protein saliva infected anopheles, mosquito
gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (mosgilt), inhibits the
ability sporozoites traverse cells readily establish infection the
vertebrate host. determine whether mosgilt influences plasmodium within the
mosquito, generated anopheles gambiae mosquitoes carrying mosaic mutations 
the mosgilt gene using crispr/crispr associated protein 9 (cas9). here, show
that female mosaic mosgilt mutant mosquitoes display defects ovarian
development refractoriness plasmodium. following infection either
plasmodium berghei plasmodium falciparum, mutant mosquitoes significantly
reduced oocyst numbers result increased thioester-containing protein 1
(tep1)-dependent parasite killing. expression vitellogenin (vg), major
yolk protein reduce parasite-killing efficiency tep1, severely
impaired mutant mosquitoes. mosgilt mosquito factor essential for
ovarian development indirectly protects human rodent plasmodium
species mosquito immunity.
