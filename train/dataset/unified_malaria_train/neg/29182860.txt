the unique occurrence g-quadruplexes at-rich genome human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum provides hints critical roles in
parasite survival, pathogenesis, host immune evasion. intriguing question 
is whether noncanonical structures serve molecular targets small
molecule-based interventions malaria. study, investigated
the pharmacological targeting g-quadruplexes parasite inhibition. we
observed bisquinolinium derivatives 1,8-naphthyridine pyridine
affected stability molecular recognition properties g-quadruplexes 
telomeric subtelomeric regions p. falciparum. parasite inhibition and
cytotoxicity assays revealed ligands effectively inhibit parasite
growth minimal toxic effects human cells. g-quadruplex interacting
ligands caused degeneration shortening parasite telomeres. ligand-induced 
perturbations telomere homeostasis also affected transcriptional state 
subtelomeric region harboring antigenic variation genes. taken together, our
results suggest quadruplex-ligand interaction disturbs
telomeric/subtelomeric chromatin organization induces dna damage that
consequently leads parasite death. findings also draw attention the
striking differences telomere dynamics protozoan parasite human
host exploited selective targeting telomeric quadruplex of
the parasite potential antimalarial strategy.
