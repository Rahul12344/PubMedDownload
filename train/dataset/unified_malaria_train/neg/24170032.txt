there growing evidence human genetic factors controlling outcome of
malaria infection, molecular basis genetic control still poorly 
understood. case-control family-based studies carried to
identify genes underlying host susceptibility malarial infection. parasitemia 
and mild malaria genetically linked human chromosomes 5q31-q33 and
6p21.3, several immune genes located within regions been
associated malaria-related phenotypes. association linkage studies of
resistance malaria easy carry human populations, 
the difficulty surveying significant number families. murine models 
proven excellent genetic tool studying host response malaria;
their use allowed mapping 14 resistance loci, eight controlling parasitic
levels six controlling cerebral malaria. quantitative trait loci or
genes identified, human ortholog may identified.
comparative mapping studies showed couple human mouse might share
similar genetically controlled mechanisms resistance. way, char8,
which controls parasitemia, mapped chromosome 11; char8 corresponds to
human chromosome 5q31-q33 contains immune genes, il3, il4, il5,
il12b, il13, irf1, csf2. nevertheless, part genetic factors
controlling malaria traits might differ hosts specific
host-pathogen interactions. finally, novel genetic tools including animal models 
were recently developed offer new opportunities identifying genetic 
factors underlying host phenotypic response malaria, help better
therapeutic strategies including vaccine drug development.
