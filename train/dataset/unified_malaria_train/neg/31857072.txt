second third generation sequencing methods crucial population genetic
studies, variant detection popular approach exploiting sequence
data. mini- microsatellites historically useful markers for
studying important protozoa toxoplasma plasmodium spp., detecting
non-repetitive variants found genes fundamental to
investigating pathogen's biology. variants, namely single nucleotide
polymorphisms insertions deletions, help elucidate genetic basis 
of organism's pathogenicity, identify selective pressures, resolve
phylogenetic relationships. also added benefit possessing a
comparatively low mutation rate, contributes stability. however,
there plethora variant analysis tools nuanced pipelines and
conflicting recommendations best practise, confounding. this
lack standardisation means variant analysis requires careful parameter
optimisation, understanding limitations, availability high
quality data. review explores value variant detection applied to
non-model organisms clinically important protozoan pathogens. the
limitations current methods discussed, including special considerations
that require end-users' attention ensure results generated are
reproducible, biological conclusions drawn valid.
