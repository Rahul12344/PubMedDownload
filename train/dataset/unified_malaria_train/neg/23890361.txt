background: pakistan, plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum co-exist 
usage sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) p. falciparum exposes p. vivax
to drug leading generation resistant alleles. main aim this
study investigate frequency distribution drug resistance associated
mutations pvdhfr, pvdhps genes provide baseline molecular epidemiological 
data sp-associated resistance p. vivax southern pakistan.
methods: january 2008 may 2009, total 150 samples collected
from patients tested slide-positive p. vivax, aga khan university
hospital, karachi, collection units located baluchistan sindh
province. nested pcr using pvdhfr pvdhps specific primers performed for
all samples.91.3% (137/150) samples tested pcr positive which
87.3% (131/137) successfully sequenced. sample sequencing data analysed 
and compared wild type reference sequences.
results: dhfr, mutations observed codons f57l, s58r s117n/t. novel
non-synonymous mutations observed codon positions n50i, g114r e119k
while synonymous mutation observed codon position 69y. dhps,
mutations observed codon position a383g a553g novel
non-synonymous mutations observed codon positions s373t, e380k, p384l,
n389t, v392d, t393p, d459a, m601i, a651d a661v.
conclusion: first report southern pakistan sp resistance in
clinical isolates p. vivax. results study confirm diverse drug 
resistant alleles circulating within region.
