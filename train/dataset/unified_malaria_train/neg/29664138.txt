the eukaryotic ribonucleic acid (rna) exosome versatile multiribonuclease
complex mediates processing, surveillance, degradation virtually 
all classes rna nucleus cytoplasm. complex, composed 10
to 11 subunits, widely described many organisms. bioinformatic
analyses revealed may also exosome-like complex plasmodium
falciparum, parasite great importance public health, eight predicted
subunits high sequence similarity counterparts yeast and
human. work, putative rna catalytic components, designated pfrrp4,
pfrrp41, pfdis3, pfrrp6, identified systematically analyzed.
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) analyses suggested them
were transcribed steadily throughout asexual stage. expression these
proteins determined western blot, localization narrowed the
cytoplasm parasite indirect immunofluorescence. recombinant
proteins pfrrp41, pfdis3, pfrrp6 exhibited catalytic activity for
single-stranded rna (ssrna), whereas pfrrp4 showed processing activity both

exosome complex opens new perspectives deep understanding rna
