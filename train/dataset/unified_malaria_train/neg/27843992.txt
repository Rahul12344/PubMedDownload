myxosporeans best known diseases cause commercially important
fish species. identification myxosporeans species-level mainly based
on conventional methods. 18s rrna gene sequence morphologically identified
myxobolus orissae infecting gill lamellae mrigal carp cirrhinus mrigala
was characterized present study. plasmodia m.orissae small,
elongated white pale colour. phylogenetically, 18s rdna nucleotide 
sequence m.orissae clustered gill-infecting myxobolus spp. of
cyprinids. species closely related m. orissae m. koi (fj841887)
infecting gill lamellae cyprinus carpio 96% similarity. carp
fin-infecting thelohanelluscaudatus (kc865607) india exhibited 78% dna 
sequence similarity m. orissae. low level m. orissae infection gill
caused thickening epithelial cells surrounding plasmodium. stressful
conditions, likely infection easily spread confined fish
and may cause serious disease outbreaks economical losses.
