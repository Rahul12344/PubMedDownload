the efficacy current antimalarial drugs threatened reduced
susceptibility plasmodium falciparum artemisinin, associated mutations
in pfkelch13 another gene variants known modulate response to
artemisinin encodes μ subunit ap-2 adaptin trafficking complex. to
elucidate cellular role ap-2μ p. falciparum, performed conditional
gene knockout, severely disrupted schizont organization maturation,
leading mislocalization key merozoite proteins. ap-2μ thus essential for
blood-stage replication. generated transgenic p. falciparum parasites
expressing hemagglutinin-tagged ap-2μ examined cellular localization by
fluorescence electron microscopy. together mass spectrometry analysis of
coimmunoprecipitating proteins, studies identified ap-2μ-interacting
partners, including ap-2 subunits, k10 kelch-domain protein, pfehd,
an effector endocytosis lipid mobilization, evidence found of
interaction clathrin, expected coat protein ap-2 vesicles. in
reverse immunoprecipitation experiments clathrin nanobody, other
heterotetrameric ap-complexes shown interact clathrin, ap-2
complex subunits absent.importance examine detail ap-2 adaptin
complex malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum studied
organisms, ap-2 involved bringing material cell outside, a
process called endocytosis. previous work shows changes μ subunit 
ap-2 contribute drug resistance. experiments show ap-2 is
essential parasite development blood role in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. suggests specialized function ap-2
has developed malaria parasites, may important understanding
its impact drug resistance.
