malate lactate dehydrogenases (mdh ldh) homologous, core metabolic
enzymes share fold catalytic mechanism yet possess strict specificity 
for substrates. apicomplexa, convergent evolution unusual ldh 
from mdh produced difference specificity exceeding 12 orders magnitude.
the mechanisms responsible extraordinary functional shift currently 
unknown. using ancestral protein resurrection, find specificity evolved
in apicomplexan ldhs classic neofunctionalization characterized long-range 
epistasis, promiscuous intermediate, gain-of-function mutations of
large effect. canonical mdhs ldhs, single residue active-site
loop governs substrate specificity: arg102 mdhs gln102 ldhs. the
evolution apicomplexan ldh, however, specificity switched via insertion
that shifted position identity 'specificity residue' trp107f. 
residues far active site also determine specificity, shown the
crystal structures three ancestral proteins bracketing key duplication
event. work provides unprecedented atomic-resolution view evolutionary
trajectories creating nascent enzymatic function.
