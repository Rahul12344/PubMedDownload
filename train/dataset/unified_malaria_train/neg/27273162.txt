objective: aim study determine distribution origin 
hemoglobin e (hbe) seven minority groups various geographical regions 
the malaria-endemic yunnan province, southwestern china, similar
ethnic origins geographic relationships hbe-prevalent populations of
southeast asian countries.
methods: using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (pcr-rflp) methods, prevalence hbe examined 1488
individuals seven native minority groups yunnan, β-globin gene
cluster haplotypes determined 1420 chromosomes.
results: prevalence hbe study populations ranged 1.5 39.1%.
higher hbe prevalence correlated minority groups tibeto-burman
origin groups dehong district. βe -globin genes yunnan were
mostly associated three haplotypes [-+++++-], [+----+-], [-+-+++-] on
chromosomes gene framework 2. interestingly, predominant βe associated
haplotype yunnan minorities remarkably different other
previously reported populations. study, first time, reports
population-based data heterogeneity hbe gene frequencies haplotype 
distribution native minorities southwestern china.
conclusions: natural selection based presence malaria, ethnic origin,
and epistatic interactions may factors varying importance the
remarkable variation hbe frequency among minority groups. addition,
there appears common origin βe -globin gene populations from
yunnan southeast asia. am. j. hum. biol. 28:927-931, 2016. © 2016wiley
