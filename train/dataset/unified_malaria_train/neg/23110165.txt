it proposed ovale malaria humans caused two closely
related distinct species malaria parasites: p. ovale curtisi p. ovale 
wallikeri. extended optimized real-time pcr assay targeting the
parasite's small subunit ribosomal rna (ssrrna) gene detect these
species. assay applied 31 archival blood samples patients
diagnosed p. ovale, found infection 20 due p.
ovale curtisi remaining 11 p. ovale wallikeri. thus, assay
provides useful tool applied epidemiological investigations of
the two newly recognized distinct p. ovale species, might reveal these
species also differ clinical manifestation, drugs susceptibility and
relapse periodicity. results presented confirm p. ovale wallikeri not
confined southeast asia, since majority patients analyzed this
study acquired p. ovale infection african countries, mostly situated
in west africa.
