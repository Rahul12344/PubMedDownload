background: covid-19 morbidity mortality associated dysregulated
immune response. tools needed enhance existing immune profiling
capabilities affected patients. aimed develop approach to
support design targeted blood transcriptome panels profiling the
immune response sars-cov-2 infection.
methods: designed pool candidates based pre-existing and
well-characterized repertoire blood transcriptional modules. available
covid-19 blood transcriptome data also used guide process. further
selection steps relied expert curation. additionally, developed several
custom web applications support evaluation candidates.
results: proof principle, designed three targeted blood transcript
panels, different translational connotation: immunological relevance,
therapeutic development relevance sars biology relevance.
conclusion: altogether work presented may contribute future
expansion immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling blood
transcript abundance covid-19 patients.
