abstract: first-line drug artemisinin widely used malaria.
commercially available artemisinin extracted plants. however, lack of
sufficient raw material, artemisinin cost associated drug's
manufacture limited supply act malaria sufferers the
developing world. such, important develop low cost, fine to
environment high-quality method supply sufficient reliable quantities 
of artemisinin future. field synthetic biology, utilizes cell
factories manipulate microbial metabolism enhance production of
artemisinin intermediates, particularly strong impact providing 
new platforms chemical production. brief introduction the
artemisinin biosynthetic pathway, present review focuses introduction 
of artemisinin biosynthetic genes, genes encoding amorpha-4, 11-diene
monooxygenase, nadph: cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase, artemisinic aldehyde delta 
11(13) reductase aldehyde dehydrogenase. review also addresses general
considerations potential contributions synthetic biology artemisinin
production, emphasis factors influencing interest compounds production
in chassis cells.
