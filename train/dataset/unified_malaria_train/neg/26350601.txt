microorganisms like halophilic archaeon halobacterium sp. nrc-1 produce
gas-filled buoyant organelles, easily purified protein nanoparticles
(called gas vesicles gvnps). gvnps non-toxic, exceptionally stable,
bioengineerable, self-adjuvanting. large gene cluster encoding 
dozen proteins implicated biogenesis. one protein, gvpc, found 
on exterior surface nanoparticles, accommodate insertions near the
c-terminal region results gvnps displaying inserted sequences the
surface nanoparticles. here, review current state knowledge on
gvnp structure biogenesis well available studies immunogenicity of
pathogenic viral, bacterial, eukaryotic proteins peptides displayed on
the nanoparticles. recent improvements genetic tools bioengineering of
gvnps discussed, along future opportunities challenges for
development vaccines applications.
