background: genetic factors play key role determining
resistance/susceptibility infectious disease. susceptibility human host
to malaria infection reported influenced genetic factors, which
could confounders taken account assessment efficacy 
of interventions malaria. study aimed assess relationship
between haemoglobin genotypes malaria children five years site 
being characterized future malaria vaccine trials.
methods: study population consisted 452 children living four rural
villages. hb genotype determined enrolment. clinical malaria incidence was
evaluated one-year period using combined active passive surveillance. 
prevalence infection evaluated via bi-annual cross-sectional surveys. at
each follow-up visit, children received brief clinical examination thick
and thin blood films prepared malaria diagnosis. clinical malaria 
defined plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia >2,500 parasites/μl axillary
temperature ≥37.5°c reported fever previous 24 hours.
results: frequencies hb genotypes 73.2% aa; 15.0% ac; 8.2% as; 2.2% cc;
1.1% cs 0.2% ss. prevalence infection enrolment ranged 61.9%-54.1%
among aa, ac children. one year follow-up, clinical malaria
incidence (95% ci) (episodes per person-year) 1.9 (1.7-2.0) aa, 1.6
(1.4-2.1) ac, 1.7 (1.4-2.0) children. ac genotype associated
with lower incidence clinical malaria relative aa genotype among children
aged 1-2 years [rate ratio (95% ci) 0.66 (0.42-1.05)] 2-3 years [rate ratio
(95% ci) 0.37 (0.18-0.75)]; association opposite direction however
apparent among children aged 3-4 years. genotype associated lower
incidence clinical malaria relative aa genotype among children aged 2-3
years [rate ratio (95% ci) 0.63 (0.40-1.01)].
conclusions: cohort children, ac genotype associated with
lower risk clinical malaria relative aa genotype among children aged
one three years. would advisable clinical studies malaria in
endemic regions consider haemoglobin gene differences potentially
important confounder, particularly among younger children.
