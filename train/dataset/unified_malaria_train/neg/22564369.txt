the introduction vaccine technology facilitated unprecedented
multi-antigen approach develop effective vaccine complex systemic
inflammatory pathogens plasmodium spp. cause severe malaria. the
capacity multi subunit dna vaccine encoding different stage plasmodium
antigens induce cd8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes interferon-Î³ responses in
mice, monkeys humans observed. moreover, genetic vaccination may 
capable eliciting cell mediated humoral immune responses. the
cytotoxic cell responses categorically needed intracellular hepatic
stage humoral response antibodies targeted antigens all
stages malaria parasite life cycle. therefore, key success dna 
based vaccine design vector able serve safe efficient
delivery system. encouraged development non-viral dna-mediated
gene transfer techniques liposome, virosomes, microsphere and
nanoparticles. efficient relatively safe dna transfection using lipoplexes
makes appealing alternative explored gene delivery. also,
liposome-entrapped dna shown enhance potency dna vaccines,
possibly facilitating uptake plasmid antigen-presenting cells (apc).
another recent technology using cationic lipids deployed has
generated substantial interest approach gene transfer. review 
we discussed various aspects could decisive formulation of
efficient stable carrier system(s) development malaria vaccine.
