avoidance antibody-mediated immune recognition allows parasites establish
chronic infections enhances opportunities transmission. human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum possesses number multi-copy gene families,
including var, rif, stevor pfmc-2tm, encode variant antigens believed
to expressed surfaces infected erythrocytes. however, studies
of antigens based vitro analyses culture-adapted isolates,
most commonly laboratory strain 3d7, thus may representative of
the unique challenges encountered p. falciparum human host. to
investigate expression var, rif-a, rif-b, stevor pfmc-2tm family
genes conditions mimic closely natural course infection,
ex vivo clinical p. falciparum isolates analyzed using novel quantitative 
real-time pcr approach. expression patterns clinical isolates various
time points first intraerythrocytic developmental cycle vitro 
compared strain 3d7. clinical isolates, contrast strain 
3d7, peak expression multi-copy gene families rif-a, stevor
and pfmc-2tm young ring stage, addition already known expression
peak trophozoites. furthermore, variant surface antigen families
were overexpressed clinical isolates relative 3d7, exception
of pfmc-2tm family, expression higher 3d7 parasites.
immunofluorescence analyses performed parallel revealed two stage-dependent
localization patterns rifin, stevor pfmc-2tm. proteins exported 
the infected erythrocyte young trophozoite stage, whereas remained
inside parasite membrane schizont stage subsequently observed
in different compartments merozoite. results reveal complex
pattern expression p. falciparum multi-copy gene families clinical
progression suggestive diverse functional roles respective
proteins.
