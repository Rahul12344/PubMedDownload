next-generation 454 sequencing techniques used re-examine diversity of
mitochondrial cytochrome b lineages avian malaria (plasmodium relictum) in
hawaii. document minimum 23 variant lineages parasite based on
single nucleotide transitional changes, addition previously reported
single lineage (grw4). new, publicly available portal (integroomer) was
developed initial parsing 454 datasets. mean variant prevalence and
frequency higher low elevation hawaii amakihi (hemignathus virens) with
avipoxvirus-like lesions (p = 0·001), suggesting variants may be
biologically distinct. contrast, variant prevalence frequency not
differ significantly among mid-elevation apapane (himatione sanguinea) or
without lesions (p = 0·691). low frequency lack detection of
variants independent grw4 suggest multiple independent introductions of
p. relictum hawaii unlikely. multiple variants may introduced in
heteroplasmy grw4 exist within tandem repeat structure the
mitochondrial genome. discovery multiple mitochondrial lineages p.
relictum hawaii provides measure genetic diversity within a
geographically isolated population parasite suggests origins 
evolution parasite diversity may complicated previously
recognized.
