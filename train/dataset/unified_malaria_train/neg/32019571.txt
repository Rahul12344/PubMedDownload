background: resistance anti-malarial drugs hinders malaria elimination.
monitoring molecular markers drug resistance helps improve malaria
treatment policies. study aimed assess distribution molecular
markers imported plasmodium falciparum infections.
methods: total, 485 p. falciparum cases imported africa, southeast asia, 
and oceania zhejiang province, china, 2016 2018 investigated.
most imported africa, cases originated asia and
oceania. blood samples collected patient. plasmodium falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) residues 72-76 and
kelch13-propeller (k13) determined nested pcr dna sequence.
results: wild-type pfcrt residues 72-76 predominant (72.61%), mutant
and mixed alleles also detected, cviet (22.72%) most
common. mutant pfcrt haplotypes frequent patients west africa
(26.92%), north africa (25%), central africa (21.93%). number cases of
p. falciparum infections small southeast asia oceania, cases
involved pfcrt mutant type. k13 propeller gene, 26 samples presented 19
different point mutations, including eight nonsynonymous mutations (p441s, d464e,
k503e, r561h, a578s, r622i, v650f, n694k). addition, r561h, one the
validated snps k13, detected one patient myanmar one patient
from rwanda. a578s, although common africa, found one patient from
cameroon. r622i detected one sample mozambique one sample from
somalia. genetic diversity k13 low regions africa and
purifying selection suggested tajima's test.
conclusions: frequency spatial distributions pfcrt k13 mutations
associated drug resistance determined. wild-type pfcrt dominant 
africa. among k13 mutations correlated delayed parasite clearance, 
r561h mutation found one case rwanda africa. pfcrt k13
mutations detected patients southeast asia oceania. these
findings provide insights molecular epidemiological profile drug
resistance markers study region.
