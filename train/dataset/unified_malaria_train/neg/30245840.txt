the human ackr1 gene encodes glycoprotein expressing duffy blood group
antigens (fy). duffy protein acts receptor distinct pro-inflammatory
cytokines malaria parasites. determined haplotypes ackr1 gene
in population inhabiting malaria-endemic area. collected blood samples
from 60 healthy volunteers ethiopia's southwestern low-altitude tropical
region. assay devised amplify ackr1 gene single amplicon and
determine genomic sequence. haplotypes resolved 5178 nucleotides 
each, covering coding sequence (cds) ackr1 gene including 5'- 
and 3'-untranslated regions (utr), intron 1, 5'- 3'-flanking regions.
when necessary, allele-specific pcr nucleotide sequencing length
polymorphism analysis applied. among 120 chromosomes analyzed, 18 ackr1
alleles confirmed without ambiguity. found 18 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps); one snp novel. non-coding sequences harbored
14 snps. snp, c.-67t>c, indicative non-functional allele, 
detected. described haplotypes ackr1 gene autochthonous
east-african population found 18 distinct ackr1 alleles. long-range
alleles useful templates phase analyze next-generation sequencing
data, thus enhancing reliability clinical diagnostics.
