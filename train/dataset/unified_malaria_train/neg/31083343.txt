sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (sp) used long-acting partner
antimalarial drugs artemisinin combination therapy (act) falciparum
malaria. emergence increasing spread sp resistance malaria-endemic 
areas become challenge control malaria. therefore, regular
monitoring mutation status partner drugs important better
management drug policy. limitations traditional molecular
methods urgent need easy method diagnosis drug
resistance. study introduced developed novel single
nucleotide polymorphism loop-mediated isothermal amplification (snp-lamp)
approach based hydroxynaphthol blue (hnb) indicator easier and
quicker detection pyrimethamine resistance plasmodium falciparum malaria.
to implement novel approach, many sets lamp primers designed and
tested. finally, one set forward inner primer m1 (fipm1) lamp primer was
selected specifically distinguishes pyrimethamine-resistant p. falciparum
malaria. lamp reactions optimized 60-66 °c 45 min. high
sensitivity (7 parasites/µl) observed 10-4 fold dilutions (<2 ng dna) of
genomic dna. moreover, approach potential applied even in
laboratories unfamiliar pcr molecular methods, future, 
can helpful better management anti-malarial policy.
