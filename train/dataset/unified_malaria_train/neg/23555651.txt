most drugs use plasmodium falciparum share similar modes of
action and, consequently, need identify alternative potential drug 
targets. here, focus apicoplast, malarial plastid-like organelle of
algal source evolved secondary endosymbiosis. undertake a
systematic silico target-based identification approach detecting drugs
already approved clinical use humans may able interfere with
the p. falciparum apicoplast. p. falciparum genome database genedb used
to compile list ≈600 proteins containing apicoplast signal peptides. of
these proteins treated potential drug target predicted sequence 
was used interrogate three different freely available databases (therapeutic
target database, drugbank stitch3.1) provide synoptic data drugs 
their primary putative drug targets. able identify several drugs
that expected interact forty-seven (47) peptides predicted be
involved biology p. falciparum apicoplast. fifteen (15) these
putative targets predicted affinity drugs already
approved clinical use never evaluated malaria
parasites. suggest drugs experimentally tested
and/or serve leads engineering new antimalarials.
