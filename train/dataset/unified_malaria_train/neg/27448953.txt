background: emergence resistant power different antimalarial
agents particularly plasmodium falciparum challenge combat malaria.
regular monitoring essential determine efficacy and
development resistance parasite also detect early sign of
regaining sensitivity anti-malarial agent withdrawn a
long period. studies molecular markers associated antimalarial drug
resistance prevailing plasmodium population play important role this
aspect. present protocol designed study polymorphisms pfcrt and
pfmdr-1 gene determine sign regaining sensitivity chloroquine among 
p. falciparum five years artemisinin combination therapy (act)
implementation.
methods: clinical isolates collected p. falciparum positive patients
attending malaria clinic calcutta school tropical medicine during
december 2014 december 2015. genomic parasitic dna extracted subjected
to sequencing pfcrt pfmdr-1 gene directly purified pcr products.
results: total 89 isolates sequenced pfcrt 73 isolates for
pfmdr-1 genes. pfcrt gene mutant k76t detected isolates all
were svmnt haplotype. three important polymorphisms pfmdr-1 gene mutant
y184f detected among isolates. one synonymous g182g one
non-synonymous s232f/y, mutation detected 99% isolates.
conclusion: isolates carrying mutant k76t pfcrt gene, considered hall
mark cq resistance, indicate sign regaining cq
sensitivity among prevailing p. falciparum population study area after
five years act implementation.
