background: zika virus (zikv) known decades africa but
contemporary data lacking large.
objectives: describe seroepidemiology zikv north central nigeria.
study design: performed cross-sectional study six health care facilities 
in north central nigeria january december 2016. detection zikv
antibodies done using anti-zikv recombinant non-structural protein 1
(ns1)-based elisa. colorimetric assay detect zikv neutralizing antibodies
was used elisa reactive randomly selected elisa non-reactive samples. zikv
real-time rt-pcr done subset samples.
results: total 468 individual samples included almost 60% from
pregnant women. using ns1-based elisa, anti-zikv positive rate 6% igm
and 4% igg found. pregnant women showed anti-zikv positive rates 4%
for igm 3% igg. none zikv antibody positive samples tested zikv
rt-pcr positive. association male sex found anti-zikv igg elisa
positivity (prevalence ratio 3.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-8.25; p = .004).
no association pregnancy, yellow fever vaccination malaria found 
anti-zikv igm igg positivity. zikv neutralizing antibodies detected in
17/18 (94%) anti-zikv ns1 positive/borderline samples one sample without
detectable zikv ns1 antibodies. partial zikv e gene sequence retrieved one
sample without zikv antibodies, clustered within west african zikv
lineage.
conclusions: results show largely zikv immunologically naïve population and
reinforce importance zikv surveillance africa.
