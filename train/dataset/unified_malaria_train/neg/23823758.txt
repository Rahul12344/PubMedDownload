introduction: importance plasmodium vivax malaria elimination is
increasingly recognized, yet little known population size 
population genetic structure south pacific, area focus of
intensified malaria control.
methods: genotyped 13 microsatellite markers 295 p. vivax isolates
from four geographically distinct sites papua new guinea (png) one site
from solomon islands, representing different transmission intensities.
results: diversity high expected heterozygosity values ranging from
0.62 0.98 different markers. effective population size high
(12'872 19'533 per site). png population structuring limited with
moderate levels genetic differentiation. f st values (adjusted high
diversity markers) 0.14-0.15. slightly higher levels observed
between png populations solomon islands (f st = 0.16).
conclusions: low levels population structure despite geographical barriers 
transmission sharp contrast results regions low p. vivax
endemicity. prior intensification malaria control programs study
area, parasite diversity effective population size remained high.
