asymptomatic malaria (asm) implicated development hemolytic
crisis infected sickle cell anemia (sca) patients worldwide. study
surveyed steady state sca nigerian patients asm investigate influence 
of malaria prevention behaviors age parasitaemia multiplicity of
infection (moi). total 78 steady sca patients aged 5 - 27 years routine
care three health facilities lagos investigated asm light
microscopy pcr multiplicity infection determined genotyping
block 2 merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) gene plasmodium falciparum (p.
falciparum). use malaria prevention measures captured using a
semi-structured questionnaire. prevalence rates asm (due pf only) by
microscopy pcr found 27.3% 47.4% respectively (p < 0.05) 
a mean + sem parasite density 2238.4 + 464.3 parasites/ul. five distinct msp1 
genotypes [k1 (2), mad20 (2), ro33 (1)] detected significant (p<0.05)
disparity allele frequencies (k1, 91.8%, mad20, 32.4%; ro33, 18.9%) found.
the overall moi 1.43 37.8% infections polyclonal (p<0.05). asm
was associated non-use preventive measures occurred 62.1% sca
patients aged < 10y lower moi 1.3 compared 38.1% older patients
with higher moi 1.5 (p<0.05). conclude pcr improved diagnosis of
asm among nigerian sca patients infections low complexity and
associated non-use preventive interventions r033 msp1 allele
