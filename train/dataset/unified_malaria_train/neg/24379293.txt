nitric oxide (no) proposed component malaria pathogenesis, the
inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (nos2) associated malaria
susceptibility. analyzed role nos2 polymorphisms bioavailability 
and susceptibility infection, plasmodium carrier status clinical
malaria. two distinct west african sample collections studied: a
population-based collection 1,168 apparently healthy individuals the
príncipe island hospital-based cohort 269 angolan children. found
that two nos2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) alleles associated to
low plasma levels noninfected individuals also associated reduced
risk pre-erythrocytic infection measured anti-csp antibody levels (6.25e-04
< p < 7.57e-04). contrast, three snp alleles within nos2 cistronic region 
conferring increased plasma levels asymptomatic carriers strongly
associated risk parasite carriage (8.00e-05 < p < 7.90e-04).
notwithstanding, three snp alleles region protected cerebral malaria
(7.90e-4 < p < 4.33e-02). cohesively, results revealed dual regimen 
genetic control bioavailability afforded nos2 depending infection
status. nos2 promoter variants operate noninfected individuals decrease
both bioavailability susceptibility pre-erythrocytic infection.
conversely, nos2 cistronic variants (namely, rs6505469) operate infected
individuals increase bioavailability confer increased susceptibility to
unapparent infection protect cerebral malaria. findings
corroborate hypothesis anti-inflammatory properties impact on
different steps malaria pathogenesis, explicitly favoring infection
susceptibility deterring severe malaria syndromes.
