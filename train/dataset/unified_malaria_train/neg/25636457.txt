malaria parasites highly virulent pathogens infect wide range of
vertebrates. despite importance, way different hosts control and
suppress malaria infections remains poorly understood. recent developments
in next-generation sequencing techniques, however, possible quantify
the response entire transcriptome infections. experimentally
infected eurasian siskins (carduelis spinus) avian malaria parasites
(plasmodium ashfordi), used high-throughput rna-sequencing measure the
avian transcriptome blood collected infection (day 0), peak
parasitemia (day 21 postinfection), parasitemia decreasing (day 31).
we found considerable differences transcriptomes infected and
uninfected individuals, large number genes differentially expressed
during peak decreasing parasitemia stages. genes were
overrepresented among functions involved immune system, stress response,
cell death regulation, metabolism, telomerase activity. comparative analyses 
of differentially expressed genes study found hosts 
of malaria (human mouse) revealed set genes potentially
involved highly conserved evolutionary responses malaria infection. by
using rna-sequencing gained complete view host response, and
were able pinpoint well-documented host genes also unannotated
genes clear significance infection, micrornas. study
shows avian blood transcriptome shifts response malaria infection, 
and believe facilitate research diversity of
molecular mechanisms hosts utilize fight malaria infections.
