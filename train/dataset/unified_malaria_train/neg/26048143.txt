background: southern house mosquito culex quinquefasciatus belongs c.
pipiens cryptic species complex, global distribution unclear taxonomy.
mosquitoes complex transmit human animal pathogens, as
filarial worm, west nile virus avian malarial plasmodium. physical gene
mapping crucial understanding genome organization, function, systematic
relationships cryptic species, basis developing new vector
control strategies. however, physical mapping established previously 
culex due lack well-structured polytene chromosomes.
methods: inbreeding used diminish inversion polymorphism asynapsis 
chromosomal homologs. identification larvae developmental stage
using shape imaginal discs allowed achievement uniformity in
chromosomal banding pattern. together high-resolution phase-contrast
photography enabled development cytogenetic map. fluorescent situ
hybridization used gene mapping.
results: detailed cytogenetic map c. quinquefasciatus polytene chromosomes
was produced. landmarks chromosome recognition cytological boundaries for
two inversions identified. locations 23 genes belonging 16 genomic
supercontigs, 2 cdna established. six supercontigs oriented one
was found putatively misassembled. cytogenetic map linked the
previously developed genetic linkage groups corresponding positions 2
genetic markers 10 supercontigs carrying genetic markers. polytene
chromosomes numbered according genetic linkage groups.
conclusions: study developed new standard cytogenetic photomap the
polytene chromosomes c. quinquefasciatus applied fine-scale
physical mapping. allowed us infer chromosomal position 1333 of
annotated genes belonging 16 genomic supercontigs find orientation 6 of
these supercontigs; new cytogenetic previously developed genetic linkage 
maps integrated based 12 matches. map assist finding 
chromosomal position medically important genes, contributing
into improvement genome assembly. better assembled c. quinquefasciatus
genome serve reference studying vector species c. pipiens
complex help resolve taxonomic relationships. this, turn,
will contribute future development vector disease control strategies.
