introductions range expansions post-introduction. however, physiological 
mechanisms mediating outcomes little known. vertebrates,
variation regulation inflammation implicated, perhaps 
inflammation imparts excessive costs, including high resource demands and
collateral damage upon encounter novel parasites. here, tested the
hypothesis variation regulation inflammation contributed the
spread house sparrows (passer domesticus) across kenya, one world's
most recent invasions species. specifically, asked whether
inflammatory gene expression declines population age (i.e. distance from
mombasa (dfm), site introduction around 1950). compared expression of
two microbe surveillance molecules (toll-like receptors, tlrs-2 4) a
proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6, il-6) injection of
an immunogenic component gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, lps)
among six sparrow populations. used best-subset model selection
approach determine whether population age (dfm) factors (e.g. malaria
or coccidian infection, sparrow density genetic group membership)
best-explained gene expression. baseline expression tlr-2 tlr-4,
population age tended best predictor expression decreasing with
population age, although factors also important. induced expression of
tlrs affected lps treatment alone. induced il-6, lps treatment
reliably predicted expression; baseline expression explained any
factor. data suggest changes microbe surveillance, than
downstream control inflammation via cytokines, might important to
the house sparrow invasion kenya.
