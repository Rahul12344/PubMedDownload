research gene drive systems rapidly advancing. many proposed applications
of gene drive research aim solve environmental public health challenges,
including reduction poverty burden vector-borne diseases, 
as malaria dengue, disproportionately impact low middle income
countries. however, due intrinsic qualities rapid spread and
irreversibility, gene drive systems raise many questions respect their
safety relative public environmental health. gene drive systems
are designed alter environments share ways hard to
anticipate impossible completely roll back, questions ethics
surrounding use research complex require careful
exploration. gene drives horizon outlines state knowledge relative 
to science, ethics, public engagement, risk assessment pertain to
research directions gene drive systems governance research process.
this report offers principles responsible practices gene drive research
and related applications use investigators, institutions, the
research funders, regulators.
