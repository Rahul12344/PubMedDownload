plasmodium polymorphum n. sp. (haemosporida, plasmodiidae) found the
skylark, alauda arvensis (passeriformes: alaudidae), autumnal migration in
southern italy. organism illustrated described based the
morphology blood stages. distinctive feature malaria
parasite clear preference blood stages (trophozoites, meronts, 
gametocytes) immature red blood cells, including erythroblasts. based on
preference erythrocytic meronts immature red blood cells, p. polymorphum
is similar species subgenus huffia . parasite readily 
distinguished bird malaria parasites, including plasmodium (
huffia ) spp., due preferential development maturation gametocytes 
in immature red blood cells, unique character avian plasmodium spp. in
addition, margins nuclei blood stages p. polymorphum markedly
smooth distinct; also distinct diagnostic feature parasite.
plasmodium polymorphum recorded skylark; probably a
rare parasite, whose host range geographical distribution remain unclear.
microscopic examination detected light infection plasmodium relictum
(lineage grw11, parasitemia <0.01%) sample p. polymorphum ;
the latter parasite clearly predominated (3.5% parasitemia). however, experienced
researchers unable detect sequences mitochondrial cytochrome b gene

published newly designed primers dna amplification avian plasmodium
spp. light parasitemia p. relictum easily detectable using several
polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assays, p. polymorphum undetectable
in applied assays. quantitative pcr also showed presence light
parasitemia (0.06%) lineage grw11 sample. supports the
conclusion morphologically distinct parasite observed along p.

because parasitemia p. polymorphum >50-fold higher p.

to amplify p. polymorphum complex problem co-infections are
