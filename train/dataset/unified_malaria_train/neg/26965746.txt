background: malaria still remains serious health burden developing
countries, causing 1 million deaths annually. given lack an
effective vaccine major etiological agent, plasmodium falciparum, and
the growing resistance parasite currently available drugs
repertoire anopheles mosquitoes insecticides, development of
innovative control measures imperative reduce malaria transmission.
paratransgenesis, modification symbiotic organisms deliver
anti-pathogen effector molecules, represents novel strategy plasmodium 
development mosquito vectors, showing potential reduce parasite
development. however, field application laboratory-based evidence of
paratransgenesis imposes use realistic confined semi-field
environments.
methods: large cages used evaluate ability bacteria genus
asaia expressing green fluorescent protein (asaia (gfp)), diffuse anopheles
stephensi anopheles gambiae target mosquito populations. asaia (gfp) was
introduced large cages release paratransgenic males sugar
feeding stations. recombinant bacteria transmission directly detected by
fluorescent microscopy, assessed molecular analysis.
results: show first known trial semi-field condition on
paratransgenic anophelines. modified bacteria able spread high rate in
different populations an. stephensi an. gambiae, dominant malaria vectors,
exploring horizontal ways successfully colonising mosquito midguts. moreover,
in an. gambiae, vertical trans-stadial diffusion mechanisms were
demonstrated.
conclusions: results demonstrate considerable ability modified asaia
to colonise different populations malaria vectors, including pecies 
association primary, large environments. data support potential
to employ transgenic asaia tool malaria control, disclosing promising
perspective field application suitable effector molecules.
