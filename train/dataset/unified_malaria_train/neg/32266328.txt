to eliminate soil-transmitted helminth (sth) infections public health
problem, administration benzimidazole (bz) drugs children recently 
intensified. but, drug pressure increases, development anthelmintic
drug resistance (ar) becomes major concern. currently, global
surveillance system monitor drug efficacy emergence ar.
consequently, unclear current efficacy used drugs and
whether ar already present. aim study pilot global
surveillance system assess anthelmintic drug efficacy emergence ar 
in sth control programs. this, incorporate drug efficacy trials 
national sth control programs eight countries (bangladesh, cambodia, lao pdr, 
vietnam, ghana, rwanda, senegal yet defined country americas).
in country, one trial performed one program implementation unit
to assess efficacy bz drugs sths school-aged children faecal
egg count reduction test. stool samples collected after
treatment bzs kato-katz analysis preserved purify parasite dna.
the presence frequency known single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) the
β-tubulin genes different sths subsequently assessed. study
will provide global pattern drug efficacy emergence ar sth control
programs. results provide complementary insights validity of
known snps ß-tubulin gene marker ar human sths well as
information technical financial resources required set a
surveillance system. finally, collected stool samples important
resource validate different molecular technologies detection ar
markers identify novel potential molecular markers associated ar in
sth.
