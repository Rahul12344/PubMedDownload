the dynamic nature mosquito gut microbiome associated different stages
of development feeding behaviors. therefore, mosquito gut harbors wide
range endogenous microbes promote numerous life processes as,
nutrition, reproduction immunity. addition, gut microbiota also play an
important role regulation plasmodium (malaria parasite) development.
thus, understanding mechanism microbial homeostasis mosquito gut might 
be one strategies manipulate malaria parasite development. the
present study, characterized 692 amino acids long secreted midgut
heme-peroxidase 2 (ashpx2) anopheles stephensi, major indian malaria
vector. presence putative integrin binding motifs, ldv (leu-asp-val),
indicated peroxinectin-like nature. phylogenetic analysis revealed that
ashpx2 culicinae lineage-specific gene. rna interference (rnai)-mediated
silencing ashpx2 gene significantly enhanced growth midgut bacteria 
sugar-fed mosquitoes sham-treated controls. interestingly, blood-feeding 
drastically reduced ashpx2 gene expression enhanced growth midgut
bacteria. results revealed negative correlation expression of
ashpx2 gene gut bacterial growth. proposed ashpx2, a
mosquito-specific gene, might serve "potent target" manipulate midgut
microbiota vector competence.
