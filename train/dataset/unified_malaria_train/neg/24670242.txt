background: drug resistance plasmodium falciparum major problem in
malaria control especially along thai-myanmar thai-cambodia borders. to
date, molecular markers identified anti-malarial resistance
in p. falciparum, including p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter 
(pfcrt) p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1). however no
information available regarding distribution pattern gene
polymorphisms parasites thai-malaysia border. study was
conducted compare distribution pattern pfcrt pfmdr1
polymorphisms parasites lower southern provinces, thai-malaysia
border upper southern provinces, thai-myanmar border. addition, in
vitro sensitivities anti-malarial drugs including chloroquine, mefloquine,
quinine, artesunate determined.
methods: all, 492 p. falciparum-positive blood samples collected the
lower southern provinces: songkhla, yala narathiwas. upper southern 
part thailand, ranong chumphon, 66 samples also collected.
polymorphisms pfcrt pfmdr1 gene determined using pcr
techniques. vitro sensitivities anti-malarial drugs determined using
radioisotopic method.
results: parasites areas contained pfcrt 76 allele. the
pfmdr1 86y allele significantly common parasites isolated from
the lower southern areas. contrast, pfmdr1 184f allele predominant
among parasites upper southern areas especially ranong. addition,
the parasites ranong contained higher copy numbers parasites from
other provinces. adapted parasite isolates exhibited cq-resistant phenotype. 
neither qn mq resistance detected isolates.
conclusion: parasites thai-malaysia border exhibited different resistant
patterns compared areas along international border thailand. this
information useful anti-malarial drug policy thailand.
