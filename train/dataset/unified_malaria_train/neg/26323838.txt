plasmodium falciparum invade stages red blood cells, plasmodium 
vivax invade reticulocytes. although many p. vivax proteins been
discovered, functions largely unknown. among them, p. vivax
reticulocyte binding proteins (pvrbp1 pvrbp2) recognize bind to
reticulocytes. proteins possess c-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane
domain, drives adhesion reticulocytes. pvrbp1 pvrbp2 large (>
326 kda), hinders identification functional domains. study, 
the complete genome information p. vivax rbp family thoroughly
analyzed using prediction server bioinformatics data predict b-cell
epitope domains. eleven pvrbp family genes included 2 pseudogenes 9 full
or partial length genes selected used express recombinant proteins in
a wheat germ cell-free system. expressed proteins used evaluate the
humoral immune response vivax malaria patients healthy individual serum 
samples protein microarray. recombinant fragments 9 pvrbp proteins were
successfully expressed; soluble proteins ranged molecular weight 16
to 34 kda. evaluation humoral immune response recombinant pvrbp
protein indicated high antigenicity, 38-88% sensitivity 100%
specificity. them, n-terminal parts pvrbp2c (pvx_090325-1) pvrbp2 like 
partial (pvx_090330-1) elicited high antigenicity. addition, pvrbp2-like
homologue b (pvx_116930) fragment newly identified high antigenicity and
may exploited potential antigenic candidate among pvrbp family. the
functional activity pvrbp family merozoite invasion remains unknown.
