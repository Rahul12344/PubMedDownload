background: nucleic acid amplification sensitive specific method 
to detect plasmodium falciparum. however polymerase chain reaction remains
laboratory-based conducted trained personnel. furthermore, the
power dependency thermocycling process costly equipment necessary
for read-out difficult cover resource-limited settings. study 
aims develop evaluate combination isothermal nucleic acid
amplification simple lateral flow dipstick detection malaria parasite 
for point-of-care testing.
methods: specific fragment 18s rrna gene p. falciparum amplified 
in 10 min constant 38°c using isothermal recombinase polymerase
amplification (rpa) method. unique probe system added reaction
solution, amplification product visualized simple lateral flow
strip without labelling. combination methods tested 
sensitivity specificity various plasmodium protozoa/bacterial 
strains, well human dna. additional investigations conducted to
analyse temperature optimum, reaction speed robustness assay.
results: lateral flow rpa (lf-rpa) assay exhibited high sensitivity and
specificity. experiments confirmed detection limit low 100 fg genomic 
p. falciparum dna, corresponding sensitivity approximately four parasites
per reaction. investigated p. falciparum strains (n=77) positively
tested total 11 non-plasmodium samples, showed negative test
result. enzymatic reaction conducted broad range conditions
from 30-45°c high inhibitory concentration known pcr inhibitors. time
to result 15 min start reaction read-out determined.
conclusions: combining isothermal rpa lateral flow detection an
approach improve molecular diagnostic p. falciparum resource-limited
settings. system requires none little instrumentation nucleic
acid amplification reaction read-out possible naked eye.
showing sensitivity specificity comparable diagnostic methods but
simultaneously increasing reaction speed dramatically reducing assay
requirements, method potential become true point-of-care test for
the malaria parasite.
