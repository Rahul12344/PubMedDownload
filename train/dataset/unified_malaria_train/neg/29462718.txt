artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum associated mutations 
the propeller domain pfk13 gene increased
phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (pfpi3k) activity. assessment genetic
diversity pfk13 ortholog pvk12 plasmodium vivax field samples 
same hotspots p. falciparum artemisinin resistance revealed limited genetic 
diversity pvk12. following logic, analyzed genetic variations of
the pvpi3k gene 188 p. vivax field isolates two geographic locations
along china-myanmar border. overall, high genetic diversity pvpi3k was
observed; parasites yunnan's tengchong county higher genetic diversity
than laiza township, kachin state, myanmar. almost neutrality 
tests applied detected statistically significant deviation zero. the
negative tajima's values populations implicated pvpi3k gene might 
have experienced either directional selection expansion population
size. low linkage disequilibrium pvpi3k mutations both
populations, suggesting existence large, almost panmictic, parasite
populations enabled effective recombination. later result confirmed
by detection minimum five recombination events population
with two major breakpoints. multiple tests selection confirmed signature of
purifying selection pvpi3k. amino acid mutations predicted 
neutral pi3k protein's function. findings provide insights the
genetic diversity p. vivax populations along china-myanmar border.
