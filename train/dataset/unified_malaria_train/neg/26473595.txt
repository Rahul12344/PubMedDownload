toxoplasma gondii possesses sets dense granule proteins (gras) either
assemble at, cross parasitophorous vacuole membrane (pvm) exhibit
motifs resembling ht/pexel previously identified repertoire exported 
plasmodium proteins. within plasmodium spp., cleavage ht/pexel motif by
the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protease plasmepsin v precedes trafficking 
and export across pvm proteins involved pathogenicity host cell
remodelling. here, functionally characterized t. gondii aspartyl
protease 5 (asp5), golgi-resident protease phylogenetically related 
plasmepsin v. show deletion asp5 causes significant loss parasite
fitness vitro altered virulence vivo. furthermore, reveal that
asp5 necessary cleavage gra16, gra19 gra20 pexel-like
motif. absence asp5, intravacuolar nanotubular network disappears
and several gras fail localize pvm, gra16 gra24, known
to targeted host cell nucleus, retained within vacuolar space. 
additionally, hypermigration dendritic cells bradyzoite cyst wall
formation impaired, critically impacting parasite dissemination and
persistence. overall, absence asp5 dramatically compromises parasite's
ability modulate host signalling pathways immune responses.
