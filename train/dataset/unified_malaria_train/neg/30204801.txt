the quantity intra-erythrocytic deoxyhemoglobin (hb s) affects level
of protection malaria also sickling phenomenon. study
reports significantly lower concentration hb females males. data 
came 350 children, aged 12-47 months participated phase 2b malaria 
vaccine trial. hemoglobinopathy g6pd deficiency typing necessary to
ascertain equal representation malaria protective traits across the
vaccine cohorts. hemoglobin types (hbaa, hbas) % hb evaluated hplc.
alpha thalassemia (alpha-thal) g6pd genotypes evaluated pcr. the
overall prevalence hbas 20%, 46% 3 alpha genes 10% 2 alpha
genes 14% g6pd a-. females hbas/αα/αα genotype low hb 
males mean % hb 37.5% ± 5.4 sd, compared 42.0% ± 2.5 sd males 
of genotype (p = 0.018). consistent reduction malaria protective
hb females, parasite load females nearly twice males 
difference statistically significant. x-chromosome linked g6pd
deficiency influence level hb s. conclude that, low hb in
these females explains resultant higher malaria parasite load. speculate
that low hb females could also explain observations suggesting 
sickling phenomenon tends less severe females males.
