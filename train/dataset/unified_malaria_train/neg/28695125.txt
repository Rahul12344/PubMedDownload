acquired immune deficiency syndrome severe disease humans caused human
immunodeficiency virus. several human genes characterized host genetic
factors impact processes aids disease. recent studies aids
patients revealed series disease complicating aids. resolve gene
interaction aids complicating diseases, canonical correlation
analysis used identify global correlation aids other
disease pathway genes expression. results showed hla-b, hla-a, mh9,
zned1, irf1, tlr8, tsg101, ncor2, gml key aids-restricted genes
highly correlated disease pathway genes. furthermore, pathway genes in
several diseases asthma, autoimmune thyroid disease, malaria were
globally correlated args. suggests diseases high risk in
aids patients complicating diseases.
