insects considered pests globally, implicated destruction of
agricultural fields transmission pathogens cause deadly human
diseases, dengue, zika malaria. diversity insecticide
arsenal remained stagnant decades, recent rise insecticide
resistance fueled discovery novel modes action, power of
genomics reinvigorated search. review discusses importance of
comparative functional insect genomics identification potential
gene targets insecticidal mode action low off-target toxicity. due
to global participation sequencing annotation insect genomes,
the targeting specific genes molecular tools like rnai crispr/cas9
for genome engineering consequent functional identification validation
has become efficient. multiple avenues explore for
insecticidal candidates, review identifies g-protein coupled receptors as
attractive targets, hones octopamine dopamine receptors due 
their potential.
