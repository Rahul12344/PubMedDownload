introduction: infants born mothers placental malaria delivery develop 
plasmodium falciparum parasitemia earlier born mothers without
placental infection. phenomenon may explained development of
immune tolerance due exposure p. falciparum antigens utero. the
hypothesis study increased susceptibility might related
to infections parasites expressing blood stage allele's antigens as
those infants exposed utero.
methods: comparison p.falciparum msp2 (3d7 fc27) glurp gene
polymorphisms infected mothers delivery offspring's
infections infancy realized possible associations the
different polymorphisms clinical outcomes assessed. second approach
consisted use geographic information system determine whether 
antigen alleles homogeneously distributed area study. was
necessary analyze whether biological observations due high
exposure particular antigen allelic form environment high
infant permissiveness allelic antigen polymorphism placental
one.
results: infants born mothers placental malaria delivery more
susceptible infections parasites carrying glurp allele as
encountered utero compared distinct alleles, independently their
geographic distribution.
conclusion: increased permissiveness infants plasmodial infections with
shared placental-infant glurp alleles sheds light role p. falciparum 
blood stage antigen polymorphisms may play first plasmodial infections 
infancy.
