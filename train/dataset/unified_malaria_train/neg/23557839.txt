the plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen1 (ama1) leading malaria
vaccine candidate antigen. present investigation, first time, 
almost full length ama1 gene covering domain (di), dii diii pcr 
amplified sequenced 21 p. falciparum isolates collected the
southeastern parts iran. result showed low genetic diversity of
iranian pfama1 11 pfama1 haplotypes nine 11 haplotypes are
novel reported first time. iranian p. falciparum
population indicated moderate level genetic differentiation. difference 
among rates non-synonymous synonymous mutations, tajima's and
mcdonald-kreitman tests suggested diversity di due positive
natural selection. addition, recombination contributes diversity of
iranian pfama1 supported decline linkage disequilibrium
index r(2) increasing nucleotide distance. highly polymorphic
residues (positions: 187, 197, 200, 230 243) polymorphic; however, 
of snps non-polymorphic residues conserved except residue at
position 395. nevertheless, mutation found dii loop iranian 
pfama1, indicating subjected purifying selection. conclusion,
the low genetic diversity pfama1 among iranian isolates supports provides 
valuable information development pfama1-based malaria vaccine.
