histone modifications play major role regulation gene expression.
accumulated evidence shown histone modifications mediate biological
processes transcription cooperatively. led hypothesis 
'histone code' suggests combinations different histone
modifications correspond unique chromatin states distinct functions. 
in paper, propose framework based association rule mining to
discover potential regulatory relations histone modifications and
gene expression plasmodium falciparum. approach output rules with
statistical significance. discovered rules supported by
literature experimental results. moreover, also discovered de novo
rules guide research epigenetic regulation transcription.
based association rules build model predict gene expression, which
outperforms published bayesian network model gene expression prediction 
histone modifications. results study reveal mechanisms histone
modifications regulate transcription large-scale. among findings, the
cooperation among histone modifications provides new evidence hypothesis 
of histone code. furthermore, rules output method used to
predict change gene expression.
