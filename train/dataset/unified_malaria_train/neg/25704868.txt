host-parasite interactions potential influence broadscale ecological 
and evolutionary processes, levels endemism, divergence patterns and
distributions host populations. understanding mechanisms involved requires
identification factors shape parasite distribution prevalence. 
lack comparative information community-level host-parasite associations
limits understanding role parasites host population divergence
processes. avian malaria (haemosporidian) parasites bird communities offer a
tractable model system examine potential pathogens influence
evolutionary processes natural host populations. using cytochrome b variation,
we characterized phylogenetic diversity prevalence two genera avian
haemosporidian parasites, plasmodium haemoproteus, analysed biogeographic
patterns lineages across islands avian hosts, southern melanesian bird 
communities identify factors explain patterns infection. plasmodium
spp. displayed isolation-by-distance effects, significant amount genetic
variation distributed among islands insignificant amounts among host species 
and families, strong local island effects respect prevalence.
haemoproteus spp. display isolation-by-distance patterns, showed marked
structuring genetic variation among avian host species families, and
significant host species prevalence patterns. differences suggest that
plasmodium spp. infection patterns shaped geography abiotic
environment, whereas haemoproteus spp. infection patterns shaped
predominantly host associations. heterogeneity complement and
prevalence parasite lineages infecting local bird communities likely exposes
host species mosaic spatially divergent disease selection pressures
across naturally fragmented distributions southern melanesia. host
associations haemoproteus spp. indicate capacity formation of
locally co-adapted host-parasite relationships, feature may limit
intraspecific gene flow range expansions closely related host species.
