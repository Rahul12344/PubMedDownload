malaria pathogenesis caused replication plasmodium parasites within 
the red blood cells (rbcs) vertebrate host. selective pressure has
favored evolution protective polymorphisms erythrocyte proteins, a
subset serve cognate receptors parasite invasion ligands.
recently, generation rbcs immortalized hematopoietic stem cells
(hscs) offered tractable system genetic manipulation long-term
in vitro culture, enabling elucidation functional determinants host
susceptibility vitro. report generation immortalized
erythroid progenitor cell line (ej cells) 100 000 peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. offers robust method creation customized model
systems small volumes peripheral blood. ej cell differentiation
mirrored erythropoiesis primary hscs, yielding orthochromatic erythroblasts
and enucleated rbcs eight days (ejrbcs). ejrbcs supported invasion by
both p. vivax p. falciparum. demonstrate genetic tractability 
system, used crispr/cas9 disrupt duffy antigen/receptor chemokines 
(darc) gene, encodes canonical receptor p. vivax humans. invasion
of p. vivax darc-knockout cell line strongly inhibited providing
direct genetic evidence p. vivax requires darc rbc invasion. further,
genetic complementation darc restored p. vivax invasion. taken together, the
peripheral blood immortalization method presented offers capacity to
generate biologically representative model systems studies blood-stage
malaria invasion peripheral blood donors harboring unique genetic
backgrounds, rare polymorphisms.
