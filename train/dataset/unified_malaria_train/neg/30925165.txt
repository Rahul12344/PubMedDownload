measuring overlap two populations is, principle, straightforward. 
upon fully sampling populations, number shared objects-species,
taxonomical units, gene variants, depending context-can directly
counted. practice, however, fraction population's objects are
likely sampled due stochastic data collection sequencing techniques. 
although methods exists quantifying population overlap subsampled
conditions, bias well documented uncertainty estimates 
cannot quantified. derive validate method rigorously estimate
the population overlap incomplete samples total number objects, 
species, genes population known, special case general
Î²-diversity problem particularly relevant ecology genomic
epidemiology malaria. solving bayesian inference problem, method
takes account rates subsampling produces unbiased and
bayes-optimal estimates overlap. addition, provides natural framework 
for computing uncertainty estimates, used prospectively 
study planning quantifying tradeoff sampling effort and
uncertainty.
