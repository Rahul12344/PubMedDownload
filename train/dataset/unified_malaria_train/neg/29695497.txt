transcriptomics, analysis genome-wide rna expression, common approach
to investigate host pathogen processes infectious diseases. technical 
bioinformatic advances permitted increasingly thorough analyses the
association rna expression fundamental biology, immunity, pathogenesis,
diagnosis, prognosis. transcriptomic approaches used realize 
previously unattainable goal, simultaneous study rna expression host
and pathogen, order better understand interactions. exciting
prospect without challenges, especially focus moves interactions
in vitro tightly controlled conditions tissue- systems-level
interactions animal models natural experimental infections humans. 
here review contribution transcriptomic studies understanding of
malaria, parasitic disease exerted major influence human
evolution continues cause huge global burden disease. consider
malaria paradigm transcriptomic assessment systemic host-pathogen
interactions humans, much direct host-pathogen interaction
occurs within blood, readily sampled compartment body. illustrate
lessons learned transcriptomic studies malaria lessons may 
guide studies host-pathogen interactions infectious diseases. we
propose potential transcriptomic studies improve understanding
of malaria disease remains partly untapped limitations study
design rather consequence technological constraints. further
advances require integration transcriptomic data analytical
approaches scientific disciplines, including epidemiology and
mathematical modeling.
