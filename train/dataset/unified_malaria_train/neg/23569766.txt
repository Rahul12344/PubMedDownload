plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) responsible majority of
life-threatening cases human malaria, causing 1.5-2.7 million annual deaths.
the global emergence drug-resistant malaria parasites necessitates
identification characterization novel drug targets potential
inhibitors. identified carbonic anhydrase (ca) genes p. falciparum. the
pfca gene encodes anÎ±-carbonic anhydrase, zn(2+)-metalloenzme, possessing
catalytic properties distinct human host ca enzyme. amino
acid sequence pfca enzyme different analogous protozoan and
human enzymes. library aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides possessing large
diversity scaffolds found good inhibitors malarial
enzyme moderate-low micromolar submicromolar inhibitions. structure of
the groups substituting aromatic-ureido- aromatic-azomethine fragment of
the molecule length parent sulfonamide critical parameters
for inhibitory properties sulfonamides. one derivative, is, 4-
(3, 4-dichlorophenylureido)thioureido-benzenesulfonamide (compound 10) the
most effective vitro plasmodium falciparum ca inhibitor, also most
effective antimalarial compound vitro p. falciparum growth inhibition. 
the compound 10 also effective vivo antimalarial agent mice infected
with plasmodium berghei, animal model drug testing human malaria
infection. therefore concluded sulphonamide inhibitors targeting
the parasite ca may potential development novel therapies against
human malaria.
