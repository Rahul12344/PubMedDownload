haemosporidian parasites widely distributed common parasites birds,
and application molecular techniques revealed remarkable diversity
among lineages. four haemosporidian genera infect avian hosts (plasmodium, 
haemoproteus, leucocytozoon fallisia), haemoproteus split two
sub-genera based morphological evidence phylogenetic support two
divergent sister clades. one clade (haemoproteus (parahaemoproteus)) contains
parasites developing birds belonging several different orders, except
pigeons doves (columbiformes), (haemoproteus (haemoproteus)) 
has previously shown infect dove hosts. provide molecular
and morphological identification haemoproteus parasites several seabird
species closely related found dove hosts. also document a
deeply divergent clade two haemosporidian lineages recovered primarily 
frigatebirds (fregatidae, pelecaniformes) sister the
hippoboscid-(hippoboscidae) transmitted dove parasites. one lineages in
this new clade parasites belongs haemoproteus iwa distributed two
species frigatebird (fregata) hosts hawaii, galapagos islands, the
eastern pacific throughout caribbean basin. haemosporidian parasites 
often considered rare seabirds due part lack low activity some
dipteran vectors (e.g., mosquitos, biting midges) marine coastal
environments; however, show h. iwa prevalent likely
vectored among frigatebirds hippoboscid flies abundant on
frigatebirds seabirds. study supports existence two sister 
clades avian haemoproteus accord subgeneric classification of
avian hemoproteids. description h. iwa galapagos fregata minor given
based morphology blood stages segments mitochondrial cytochrome 
b gene, used identification. study shows hippoboscid
flies warrant attention vectors avian haemoproteus spp., particularly 
in marine coastal environments.
