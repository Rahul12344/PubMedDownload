genetic variability drug-metabolizing enzymes drug transporters known
to influence pharmacokinetics many drugs. antimalarial drugs class
of agents known utilize metabolic elimination pathways prone genetic
variation. paper aims review genetic variants affecting antimalarial 
medications discuss clinical implications. data identified the
genes coding cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes: cyp2c8, cyp2c19, cyp2a6,
cyp2d6, cyp2b6, p-glycoprotein drug transporter. adverse effects of
amodiaquine common patients decreased cyp2c8 metabolism.
cyp2c19 variants influenced metabolism proguanil differences in
efficacy outcomes observed. ultra-metabolizers cyp2a6 showed increased
incidence adverse effects artesunate (prodrug active metabolite,
dihydroartemisinin). presence efavirenz, mutations cyp2b6 influenced
the number patients achieving day-7 lumefantrine concentrations accepted
therapeutic cut-offs. lumefantrine concentrations also influenced abcb1
variants presence nevirapine. critical pharmacogenetic
consideration identified association glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency development hemolytic anemia decreased hemoglobin levels
in patients treated primaquine combination of
chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate. findings demonstrate need close
monitoring patients originating populations genetic variation in
metabolizing enzymes prevalent, ensure optimal clinical outcomes
are achieved. future studies determine populations greatest
risk potential treatment failures and/or adverse effects, drugs most
susceptible genetic variation metabolizing enzymes, impact of
genetic influence efficacy safety first-line treatment regimens.
