artemisinin-induced dormancy proposed mechanism failures monotherapy 
and linked artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum. the
biological characterization dynamics dormant parasites well
understood. report dihydroartemisinin treatment vitro, a
small subset morphologically dormant parasites stained rhodamine 123 
(rh), mitochondrial membrane potential marker, persisted recovery.
rh-positive parasites sorted fluorescence-activated cell sorting resumed
growth 10,000/well whereas rh-negative parasites failed recover 5
million/well. furthermore, transcriptional activity mitochondrial enzymes was
detected rh-positive dormant parasites. importantly, treatment of
dormant parasites different concentrations atovaquone, mitochondrial
inhibitor, recovery dormant parasites delayed stopped. this
demonstrates mitochondrial activity critical survival regrowth of
dormant parasites rh staining provides means identifying these
parasites. findings provide novel paths studying eradicating this
dormant stage.
