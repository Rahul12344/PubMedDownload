mutations plasmodium falciparum k13 (pfk13) gene linked delayed
parasite clearance response artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) 
in southeast asia. explore evolutionary rate constraints acting on
this gene, k13 orthologs species sharing recent common ancestor p.
falciparum plasmodium vivax analyzed. comparative studies were
followed genetic polymorphism analyses within p. falciparum using 982 complete
pfk13 sequences public databases new data obtained next-generation
sequencing african haitian isolates. although k13 orthologs evolve at
heterogeneous rates, gene conserved across genus, only
synonymous substitutions found residues mutations linked the
delayed parasite clearance phenotype reported. suggests those
residues constraint undergoing nonsynonymous changes during
evolution genus. fixed nonsynonymous differences found between
pfk13 orthologs closely related species found african apes. this
indicates nonsynonymous substitutions currently found pfk13 are
younger time divergence p. falciparum closely related
species. population level, mutations linked delayed parasite
clearance found samples africa haiti. however, a
high number single pfk13 mutations segregating p. falciparum populations,
and two predominant alleles distributed worldwide. pattern discussed 
in terms changes efficacy natural selection, affected by
population expansion, may allowed emergence mutations tolerant to
acts.
