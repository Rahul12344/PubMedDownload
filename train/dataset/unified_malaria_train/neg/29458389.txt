background: although chemo-immunotherapy led improved overall survival 
for b-cell lymphoma types, relapsed refractory disease remains a
challenge. malaria drug artesunate previously identified growth
suppressor cancer types tested new treatment option in
b-cell lymphoma.
methods: included artesunate cancer sensitivity drug screen b lymphoma
cell lines. preclinical properties artesunate tested single agent
in vitro 18 b-cell lymphoma cell lines representing different histologies 
in vivo aggressive b-cell lymphoma xenograft model, using nsg mice.
artesunate-treated b lymphoma cell lines analyzed functional assays, gene
expression profiling, protein expression identify mechanism action.
results: drug screening identified artesunate highly potent anti-lymphoma
drug. artesunate induced potent growth suppression b lymphoma cells 
an ic50 comparable concentrations measured serum artesunate-treated
malaria patients, leaving normal b-cells unaffected. artesunate markedly
inhibited highly aggressive tumor growth xenograft model. gene expression
analysis identified endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress unfolded protein
response affected pathways artesunate-induced expression the
er stress markers atf-4 ddit3 specifically upregulated malignant
b-cells, normal b-cells. addition, artesunate significantly
suppressed overall cell metabolism, affecting respiration and
glycolysis.
conclusions: artesunate demonstrated potent apoptosis-inducing effects across a
broad range b-cell lymphoma cell lines vitro, prominent anti-lymphoma
activity vivo, suggesting relevant drug treatment b-cell
lymphoma.
