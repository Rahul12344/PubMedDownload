background: cystic echinococcosis global parasitic disease caused by
infection echinococcus granulosus larvae potentially life-threatening
complications humans. date, status immune cells believed be
associated pathogenicity e. granulosus infection been
demonstrated clearly.
methodology/principal findings: study, developed multiplex flow
cytometry assay investigate systemic immune status innate adaptive 
immunity 30, 180, 360 days post-infection (dpi) mice infected e.
granulousus. 30 dpi, increase number cd11b(+) cd11c(+)
antigen-presenting cells (apcs) observed. accompanied slight 
down-regulated expression co-stimulatory molecule mhc-ii, indicating the
impairment apcs early infection release secretory-excretory 
products. infected groups, observed significant increase innate
immune cells, including apcs gr-1(+) cells, dramatic increase the
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc) expressing cd11b(+)/gr-1(+). moreover,
the upregulation activated markers cd69, cd44, cd40l, the
downregulation cd62l observed cd4(+) cd8(+) cells following 
infection. regulatory cells expressing cd4(+)/cd25(+)/foxp3 (+) increased
significantly course infection.
conclusions: findings demonstrate microenvironment peripheral
immune system e. granulosus infection changes subtle detectably
ways, especially persistent period infection. found cells
were activated following infection, observed significant increase of
immunosuppressive cells mdsc treg cells could inhibit cell response
to e. granulosus antigens. suggest cells may play neglected key
role downregulation immune response long-term parasitic
infection. understanding basic functions temporal interactions these
immunosuppressive cells pave way new strategies parasite vaccine 
design.
