a balanced proinflammatory cytokine response plasmodium ssp. infection is
crucial control disease outcome. elucidate effect cytokines 
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes regulation interleukin
(il)-6 receptor (il-6r), ciliary neurotrophic factor alpha (cntfr-α) and
glycoprotein (gp)130 natural killer (nk) cells context malaria, we
assessed gene expression surface expression nk92 cells. p.
falciparum alone alter gene expression investigated receptors in
nk92 cells. analysis revealed low effect il-6 il-6r surface expression in
nk92 cells. however, transcriptional level, downregulation il-6r was
observed following il-6 stimulation. thus, il-6 might act within negative
feedback loop terminate signal transduction downregulating il-6r
expression. additionally, observed il-6r cntfr-α surface expression
were regulated combination il-2, 12, 18, gp130 influenced 
interferon-α. results show il-6 family receptors nk92 cells are
not directly influenced p. falciparum. however, cytokines usually derived from
accessory cells malaria episodes may regulate il-6 receptor signaling
pathways. finding encourages future studies physiological context 
and primary cells isolated humans without malaria.
