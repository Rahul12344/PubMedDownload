avian hemosporidian parasites genetically diverse group parasites a
near cosmopolitan distribution. past 2 decades, several pcr protocols
have designed detect parasites. majority protocols
amplify part entire mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. however, many of
these protocols co-amplify 2 genera (haemoproteus plasmodium), making it
impossible determine genus amplified without post-pcr analysis. a
uniform database (malavi), containing sequences amplified primers haemf 
and haemr2, developed increase comparability across studies. we
analyzed sequences malavi database new sequences found that
digestion ecorv could used distinguish haemoproteus majority 
of plasmodium sequences. addition, tested 220 wild birds costa rica
and united states avian hemosporidians assessed ability ecorv 
to distinguish 2 genera. thirty-six positive samples sequenced to
confirm restriction profiles, also analyzed 63 new hemosporidian
sequences ongoing studies united states restriction site.
among new samples, 85 haemoproteus (subgenus parahaemoproteus)
and 14 plasmodium distinguishable. overall, 887 898 (98.8%) sequences
from studies malavi database assigned correct genus. of
these samples, haemoproteus samples correctly identified 11 
plasmodium samples correctly identified ecorv assay. overall, this
restriction enzyme protocol able quickly efficiently classify 2
genera avian malarial parasites would useful researchers interested
in identifying parasites genus-level, studies focused sequence analysis 
only single genus, detecting co-infections would need cloning prior
to sequence analysis.
