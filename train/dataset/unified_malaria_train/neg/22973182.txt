background: erythrocyte polymorphism, southeast asian ovalocytosis (sao)
(which results 27-base pair deletion erythrocyte band 3 gene,
slc4a1δ27) protects cerebral malaria caused plasmodium falciparum;
however, unknown whether polymorphism also protects p. vivax
infection disease.
methods findings: association sao p. vivax infection was
examined genotyping 1,975 children enrolled three independent
epidemiological studies conducted madang area papua new guinea. sao was
associated statistically significant 46% reduction incidence of
clinical p. vivax episodes (adjusted incidence rate ratio [irr] = 0.54, 95% ci
0.40-0.72, p<0.0001) cohort infants aged 3-21 months significant
52% reduction p. vivax (blood-stage) reinfection diagnosed pcr (95% ci
22-71, p = 0.003) 55% light microscopy (95% ci 13-77, p = 0.014),
respectively, cohort children aged 5-14 years. sao also associated
with reduction risk p. vivax parasitaemia children 3-21 months
(1,111/µl versus 636/µl, p = 0.011) prevalence p. vivax infections in
children 15-21 months (odds ratio [or] = 0.39, 95% ci 0.23-0.67, p = 0.001). a
case-control study children aged 0.5-10 years, child sao found
among 27 cases severe p. vivax mixed p. falciparum/p. vivax malaria (or =
0, 95% ci 0-1.56, p = 0.11). sao associated protection severe p.
falciparum malaria (or = 0.38, 95% ci 0.15-0.87, p = 0.014) effect was
seen either risk acquiring blood-stage infections uncomplicated
episodes p. falciparum. although duffy antigen receptor expression and
function affected sao erythrocytes compared non-sao children, high
level (>90% binding inhibition) p. vivax duffy binding protein-specific binding
inhibitory antibodies observed significantly often sera sao
than non-sao children (sao, 22.2%; non-sao, 6.7%; p = 0.008).
conclusions: three independent studies, observed strong associations
between sao protection p. vivax malaria mechanism is
independent duffy antigen. p. vivax malaria may contributed to
shaping unique host genetic adaptations malaria asian oceanic
populations. please see later article editors' summary.
