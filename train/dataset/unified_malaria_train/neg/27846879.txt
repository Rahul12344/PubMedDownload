background: greater mekong subregion aiming achieve regional malaria
elimination 2030. though shift malaria parasite species predominance by
plasmodium vivax recently documented, transmission two minor 
plasmodium species, plasmodium malariae plasmodium ovale spp., poorly
characterized region. study aims determine prevalence these
minor species china-myanmar border area genetic diversity.
methods: epidemiology study conducted passive case detection in
hospitals clinics myanmar four counties china along the
china-myanmar border. cross-sectional surveys conducted villages and
camps internally displaced persons determine prevalence malaria
infections. malaria infections diagnosed initially microscopy later
in laboratory using nested pcr ssu rrna genes. plasmodium malariae
and p. ovale infections confirmed sequencing pcr products. p.
ovale subtypes determined sequencing pocytb, pocox1 pog3p genes. 
parasite populations evaluated pcr amplification sequencing the
msp-1 genes. antifolate sensitivity assessed sequencing dhfr-ts and
dhps genes p. malariae p. ovale isolates.
results: analysis 2701 blood samples collected china-myanmar border
by nested pcr targeting parasite ssu rrna genes identified 561 malaria cases,
including 161 plasmodium falciparum, 327 p. vivax, 66 p. falciparum/p. vivax
mixed infections, 4 p. malariae 3 p. ovale spp. p. vivax p. falciparum
accounted >60 ~30% malaria cases, respectively. comparison, the
prevalence p. malariae p. ovale spp. low made ~1% 
all pcr-positive cases. nevertheless, two species often misidentified 
as p. vivax infections completely missed microscopy even among symptomatic 
patients. phylogenetic analysis ssu rrna, pocytb, pocox1 pog3p genes
confirmed three p. ovale spp. isolates belonged subtype p. ovale 
curtisi. low-level genetic diversity detected msp-1, dhfr dhps
genes minor parasite species, potentially stemming low
prevalence parasites preventing mixing. whereas dhfr
and dhps positions equivalent conferring antifolate resistance p.
falciparum p. vivax wild type, new mutation s113c corresponding the
s108 position pfdhfr identified two p. ovale curtisi isolates.
conclusions: four human malaria parasite species occurred sympatrically
at china-myanmar border. p. vivax become predominant species,
the two minor parasite species also occurred low prevalence were
often misidentified missed conventional microscopy. minor parasite
species displayed low levels polymorphisms msp-1, dhfr dhps genes.
