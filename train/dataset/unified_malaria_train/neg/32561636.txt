the circulatory immune systems mosquitoes functionally integrated. 
infection induces migration hemocytes dorsal vessel, and
specifically, regions surrounding ostia heart. periostial
hemocytes phagocytose pathogens areas hemocoel experience 
highest hemolymph flow. here, investigated whether bacterial infection
affects cardiac rhythmicity african malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae we
discovered infection escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and
staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, reduces mosquito
heart rate alters proportional directionality heart contractions.
infection alter expression genes encoding crustacean cardioactive
peptide (ccap), fmrfamide, corazonin, neuropeptide f short neuropeptide f,
indicating drive cardiac phenotype. infection upregulates
the transcription two superoxide dismutase (sod) genes, catalase a
glutathione peroxidase, dramatically induces upregulation nitric oxide
synthase (nos) heart hemocytes. within heart, nitric oxide
synthase produced periostial hemocytes, chemically inhibiting the
production nitric oxide using l-name reverses infection-induced cardiac
phenotype. finally, infection induces upregulation two lysozyme genes in
the heart tissues, treating mosquitoes lysozyme reduces the
heart rate manner reminiscent infection phenotype. data
demonstrate exciting new facet integration immune and
circulatory systems insects, whereby hemocyte-produced factor immune
activity, namely nitric oxide, modulates heart physiology.
