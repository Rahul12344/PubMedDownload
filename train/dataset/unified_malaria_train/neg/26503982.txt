background: becoming increasingly apparent certain mutations the
plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) alter the
parasite's susceptibility diverse compounds. investigated the
interaction pfcrt 3 tricyclic compounds used treat
malaria (quinacrine [qc] methylene blue [mb]) study p. falciparum
(acridine orange [ao]).
methods: measured antiplasmodial activities qc, mb, ao against
chloroquine-resistant chloroquine-sensitive p. falciparum determined
whether qc ao affect accumulation activity chloroquine these
parasites. also assessed ability mutant (pfcrt(dd2)) wild-type
(pfcrt(d10)) variants protein transport qc, mb, ao expressed
at surface xenopus laevis oocytes.
results: chloroquine resistance-conferring isoforms pfcrt reduced the
susceptibility parasite qc, mb, ao. chloroquine-resistant (but
not chloroquine-sensitive) parasites, ao qc increased parasite's
accumulation of, susceptibility to, chloroquine. 3 compounds shown
to bind pfcrt(dd2), transport qc mb via protein was
saturable inhibited chloroquine resistance-reverser verapamil.
conclusions: findings reveal pfcrt(dd2)-mediated transport of
tricyclic antimalarials reduces parasite's susceptibility drugs.
