background: southeast asian deletion (--(sea)) commonly observed 
mutation among diverse α-thalassemia alleles southeast asia south china.
it generally argued mutation --(sea), like variants causing
hemoglobin disorders, associated protection malaria is
endemic regions. however, little evidence provided support
this claim.
results: first examined genetic imprint recent positive selection on
the --(sea) allele flanking sequences human α-globin cluster, covering
a genomic region spanning ~410 kb, genotyping 28 snps chinese population 
consisting 76 --(sea) heterozygotes 138 normal individuals. pattern of
linkage disequilibrium (ld) long-range haplotype test revealed a
signature positive selection. network inferred haplotypes suggested a
single origin --(sea) allele.
conclusions: thus, data support hypothesis --(sea) allele has
been subjected recent balancing selection, triggered malaria.
