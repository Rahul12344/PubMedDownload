during four decades (1960-1990s), conceptualization experimental design
of studies kin recognition relied work multicellular eukaryotes,
particularly unikonta (including invertebrates vertebrates) bikonta 
(including plants). pioneering research animal behavior approach.
during 2000s, work taxa-, clone- kin-discrimination recognition in
protists produced genetic molecular evidence unicellular organisms (e.g.
saccharomyces, dictyostelium, polysphondylium, tetrahymena, entamoeba and
plasmodium) could distinguish (self clone) different (diverse
clones), well among conspecifics close distant genetic relatedness.
here, discuss research genetics kin
discrimination/recognition highlight scientific progress made by
switching emphasis investigating multicellular unicellular systems (and
backwards). document studies protists helping us understand
the microscopic, cellular origins evolution mechanisms kin
discrimination/recognition significance advent of
multicellularity. emphasize protists among ancient
organisms earth, belong multiple taxonomic groups occupy all
environments, central reexamining traditional hypotheses in the
field kin recognition, reformulating concepts, generating new knowledge.
