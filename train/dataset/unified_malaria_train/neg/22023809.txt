differential expression ligands human malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum enables recognize different receptors erythrocyte
surface, thereby providing alternative invasion pathways. switching invasion
from using sialated nonsialated erythrocyte receptors linked the
transcriptional activation single parasite ligand. used quantitative
proteomics show addition single known change, a
significant number changes expression merozoite proteins are
regulated independent transcription invasion pathway switching. these
results demonstrate far unrecognized mechanism malaria parasite
is able adapt variations host cell environment by
post-transcriptional regulation.
