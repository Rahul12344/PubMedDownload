the interplay atp generating utilizing pathways cell is
responsible maintaining cellular atp/energy homeostasis reflected 
adenylate energy charge (aec) ratio. adenylate kinase (ak), catalyzes
inter-conversion adp, atp amp, plays major role maintaining aec and
is regulated cellular amp levels. hence, enzymes amp deaminase (ampd) 
nucleotidases, catabolize amp, indirectly regulate ak activity in-turn 
affect aec. here, present first report ampd plasmodium, the
causative agent malaria. recombinant enzyme expressed saccharomyces
cerevisiae studied using functional complementation assay residues vital 
for enzyme activity identified. similarities differences between
plasmodium falciparum ampd (pfampd) homologs yeast, arabidopsis 
humans also discussed. ampd gene deleted murine malaria
parasite p. berghei found dispensable stages the
parasite life cycle. however, episomal expression attempted, viable
parasites obtained, suggesting perturbing amp homeostasis by
over-expressing ampd might lethal. ampd known allosterically
modulated atp, gtp phosphate, allosteric activators pfampd could be
developed anti-parasitic agents.
