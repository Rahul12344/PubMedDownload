lysine deacetylases (kdacs) inhibitors may therapeutic value in
anti-malarial combination therapies artemisinin. evaluate connections
between kdacs artemisinin, saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants kdac 
genes assayed. deletion rpd3, kdac genes, resulted in
strong sensitivity artemisinin, also observed sit4δ mutants 
impaired endoplasmic reticulum (er) golgi protein trafficking. decreased
accumulation transporters pdr5p, fur4p, tat2p observed rpd3δ
and sit4δ cells. unfolded protein response induced rpd3δ cells
consistent retention proteins er. disruption protein
trafficking appears sensitize cells artemisinin targeting these
pathways may useful part artemisinin based anti-malarial therapy.
