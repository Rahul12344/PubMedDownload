mosquitoes (diptera: culicidae) key threat millions people
worldwide, since act vectors devastating pathogens parasites. the
standard method utilisation morphological characters becomes challenging
due various factors phenotypical variations. explored the
complementary approach co1 gene-based identification, analysing ten species of
mosquito vectors belonging three genera, aedes, culex anopheles from
india. analysed nucleotide sequences found without pseudo genes indels; 
they match high similarity nucleotide basic local alignment search tool
(blastn) search. partial co1 sequence anopheles niligricus first
time record submitted national center biotechnology information (ncbi).
mean intra- interspecies divergence found 1.30 3.83 %,
respectively. congeneric divergence three times higher the
conspecifics. deep intraspecific divergence noted three species,
and reason could explained accurately future improving 
sample size across different locations. transitional transversional
substitutions tested individually. ts tv substitutions 1st,
2nd 3rd codons estimated (0.44, 99.51), (40.35, 59.66) (59.16,
40.84), respectively. saturation sequences resolved, since ts
and tv exhibited linear relationship suggesting sequences not
saturated. nj ml tree analysis showed individuals same
species clustered together based co1 sequence similarity, regardless of
their collection site geographic location. overall, study adds basic
knowledge molecular evolution mosquito vectors medical veterinary
importance may useful improve biotechnological tools employed in
culicidae control programmes.
