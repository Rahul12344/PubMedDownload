objective: study genetic diversity apical membrane antigen-1 gene 
plasmodium falciparum (pfama-1).
methods: filter paper blood samples collected 23 imported p. falciparum
malaria patients returned fujian province 2006 2012. nested pcr
were used amplify pfama-1 gene. umplified fragments sequenced,
and analyzed bioinformatic software.
results: 23 samples amplified 505 bp band. thirty-two nucleotides were
found variable, resulting 18 haplotypes. eight 18 halotypes
were reported first time. parasites collected africa 
showed higher level variability [haplotypes diversity (hd)= 0.0985,
nucleotide diversity (π)=0.0258] compared isolates asia (hd=0.909,
π=0.0221). average difference dn-ds 23 pfama-1 sequences was
0.031±0.006. sequence-based neutrality tests significant africa and
asia (p>0.05). minimum number recombination events (rm) 10, the
linkage disequilibrium index (r2) evidently declined increase of
nucleotide distance. molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using the
neighbor-joining method showed 23 isolates assigned three clades
(g1, g2 g3). samples africa formed g1, g3 contained of
asian isolates.
conclusion: plasmodium falciparum isolates africa show higher genetic
diversity isolates asia pfama-1 gene.
