clinical epidemiologic screening single-nucleotide polymorphism markers
requires large-scale multiplexed genotyping. available genotyping tools require
dna extraction multiplex pcr, may limit throughput suffer
amplification bias. herein, novel genotyping approach developed,
multiplex extension ligation-based probe amplification (melpa), which
eliminates dna extraction achieves uniform pcr amplification. melpa lyses
blood dried blood spot directly captures specific target dna 96-well
plates using tailed probes. subsequent enzymatic extension ligation form
target single-nucleotide polymorphism-spanning single-stranded templates, which
are pcr-amplified using universal primers. multiplexed genotyping single-base 
primer extension analyzed mass spectrometry, call rate >97%. melpa
was compared commercial assay (iplex) detecting 24 g6pd variants known
to risk primaquine-induced hemolysis. melpa provided results 
more reliable iplex, higher throughput lower cost. genotyping
archival blood 106 malaria patients taking primaquine found 10
g6pd-deficient variants, including 1 patient hemizygous mahidol mutation
who hemolysis. preemptive g6pd genotyping 438 dried blood spots a
malaria-endemic area identified three variants. melpa also enabled pooled
genotyping without diluting rare alleles, undesired common-allele
background increased sample pooling repressed adding specific common
allele blockers. thus, melpa represents high-throughput, cost-effective
approach targeted genotyping population level.
