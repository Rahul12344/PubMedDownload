apicomplexans major lineage parasites, including causative agents of
malaria toxoplasmosis. highly adapted parasites evolved from
free-living ancestors poorly understood, particularly contain
nonphotosynthetic plastids complex metabolic dependency.
here, examine origin apicomplexan parasitism resolving the
evolutionary distribution several key characteristics closest
free-living relatives, photosynthetic chromerids predatory colpodellids.
using environmental sequence data, describe diversity these
apicomplexan-related lineages select five species represent this
diversity transcriptome sequencing. phylogenomic analysis recovered a
monophyletic lineage chromerids colpodellids sister group to
apicomplexans, complex distribution retention versus loss for
photosynthesis, plastid genomes, plastid organelles. reconstructing the
evolution plastid cytosolic metabolic pathways related apicomplexan
plastid function revealed ancient dependency plastid isoprenoid
biosynthesis, predating divergence apicomplexan dinoflagellates.
similarly, plastid genome retention strongly linked retention two
genes plastid genome, sufb clpc, altogether suggesting relatively
simple model plastid retention loss. lastly, examine broader
distribution suite molecular characteristics previously linked the
origins apicomplexan parasitism find virtually present in
their free-living relatives. emergence parasitism may driven by
acquisition novel components, rather loss modification the
existing, conserved traits.
