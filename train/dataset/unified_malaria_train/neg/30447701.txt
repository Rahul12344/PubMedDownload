background: malaria control prevention efforts continue rely heavily on
the use medicines especially artemisinin agents. however, currently, the
emergence artemisinin resistance threatens effort globally. k13-gene 
polymorphisms associated artemisinin resistance detected in
southeast asia. countries outside southeast asia, artemisinin resistance has
not yet confirmed.
methods/design: articles obtained search medline via
pubmed, scopus, embase, lilacs/vhl databases. mesh terms used 
article search. boolean operators ("and", "or") used article
search. article search done independently two librarians (rs ak). 
the articles screened inclusion using set criteria following 
prisma guidelines. data extraction done two independent reviewers (nl 
and bb), kappa statistic calculated, discrepancies resolved by
discussion. heterogeneity articles established using i2 statistic.
discussion: review focus establishing k13-gene polymorphisms
among plasmodium falciparum parasites reported previous studies in
malaria-affected countries. artemisinin resistance widely reported
among parasites africa malaria-endemic countries outside southeast
asia. however, several studies artemisinin resistance reported different 
k13-gene polymorphisms validated mutations found southeast asia. this
study collate evidence previous studies commonly reported k13
-gene polymorphisms among p. falciparum parasites malaria-affected countries.
