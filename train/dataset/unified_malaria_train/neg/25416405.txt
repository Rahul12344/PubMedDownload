background: r2 repeat region glurp reported good genetic
marker plasmodium falciparum genotyping. proper knowledge extent and
nature p. falciparum genetic diversity using highly immunogenic r2 repeat
region malaria-endemic areas crucial element understand various
aspects related immunity acquisition disease pathogenesis.
methods: population diversity p. falciparum glurp amino acid sequence
repeats glurp r2 region studied malaria-endemic assam state, northeast 
india compared interval five years 2005 (group-a) 2011
(group-b).
results: 66 samples, total 55 samples showed positive pcr bands for
glurp r2 region altogether ten types alleles size ranging 501 bp
to 1,050 bp (50 bp bin) observed coded genotypes i-x. group-a
(n = 29), 24 samples found infected single, four double one
with triple p. falciparum genotype, group-b (n = 26), single genotype
was found 23 samples, double two samples triple one sample. genotype
iv showed significant increase (p = 0.002) 2011 (group-b). genotypes 
v common group-b (62%), however genotypes vi x more
frequently distributed group-a. expected heterozygosity found slightly
higher group-a (he = 0.87) group-b (he = 0.85), whereas multiplicity of
infection (moi) group-a (moi = 1.21 ± 0.49) group-b (moi = 1.12 ± 0.43)
did display significant variation. amino acid repeat sequence unit (aau) 
dknekgqheiveveeilpe (called 'a') frequent well-conserved part 
r2 repeat region.
conclusion: present study first extensive study india has
generated substantial data understanding type distribution of
naturally evolved genetic polymorphism amino acid sequence level glurp r2
repeat region p. falciparum. decrease pcr amplicon size as
well number aau [amino acid repeat unit] group-b displaying the
bottleneck effect. present study described new type aau 'd' varied
from previous known aaus.
