current systems study essential genes human malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum often inefficient time intensive, depend the
genetic modification target locus, process hindered low frequency
of integration episomal dna genome. here, introduce method,
termed selection-linked integration (sli), rapidly select genomic
integration. sli allowed us functionally analyze targets gene and
protein levels, thus permitting mislocalization native proteins, strategy
known knock sideways, floxing induce dicre-based excision genes and
knocking altered gene copies. demonstrated power robustness this
approach validating 12 targets, including eight essential
ones. also localized inducibly inactivated kelch13, protein associated
with artemisinin resistance. expect system widely applicable p.
falciparum organisms limited genetic tractability.
