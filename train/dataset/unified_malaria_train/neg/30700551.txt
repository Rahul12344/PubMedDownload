plasmodium falciparum (pf) 4-nitrophenylphosphatase shown previously 
be involved vitamin b1 metabolism. here, conducting blastp search, found 
that 4-nitrophenylphosphatase pf significant homology with
phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgp) mouse, human, yeast, prompting us 
reinvestigate biochemical properties plasmodium enzyme. the
recombinant pfpgp enzyme insoluble, performed extended substrate screen 
and extensive biochemical characterization recombinantly expressed and
purified homolog plasmodium berghei (pb), leading identification of
2-phosphoglycolate 2-phospho-l-lactate relevant physiological
substrates pbpgp. 2-phosphoglycolate generated repair damaged dna
ends, 2-phospho-l-lactate product pyruvate kinase side reaction, both
potently inhibit two key glycolytic enzymes, triosephosphate isomerase and
phosphofructokinase. hence, pgp-mediated clearance toxic metabolites 
vital cell survival functioning. results differ significantly from
those previous study, wherein pfpgp enzyme inferred act on
2-phospho-d-lactate l isomer. apart resolving substrate
specificity conflict direct vitro enzyme assays, conducted pgp gene
knockout studies p. berghei, confirming conserved metabolic
proofreading enzyme essential plasmodium summary, findings establish
pbpgp essential enzyme normal physiological function p. berghei 
suggest drugs specifically inhibit plasmodium pgp may hold promise 
use anti-malarial therapies.
