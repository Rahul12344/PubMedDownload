background: plasmodium vivax predominant species human malaria
parasites present china. although sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) and
chloroquine (cq) widely used malaria treatment china, the
resistance profiles drugs available. analysis dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr), dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), multidrug resistance
(mdr-1) gene mutations p. vivax isolates valuable molecular approach 
mapping resistance sp cq. study investigates prevalence of
pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr-1 p. vivax clinical isolates china provides
baseline molecular epidemiologic data sp- cq-associated resistance p.
vivax.
methods: plasmodium vivax clinical isolates collected two
malaria-endemic regions china, subtropical (xishuangbanna, yunnan province)
and temperate (bozhou, anhui province), 2009 2012. isolates were
analysed single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes pvdhfr, pvdhps, and
pvmdr-1 using direct dna sequencing.
results: pvdhfr, 15% xishuangbanna isolates carried wild-type (wt) allele, 
whereas majority isolates carried mutant genes substitutions five 
codons. eight mutant haplotypes pvdhfr detected, limited
polymorphism pvdhfr found bozhou isolates. size polymorphism was
present pvdhfr, three-repeat type predominate 
xishuangbanna (79%) bozhou (97%) isolates. pvdhps, mutations four
codons detected xishuangbanna isolates leading six haplotypes,
including wt allele, single-mutation, double-mutation, triple-mutation
alleles. bozhou isolates carried wt pvhdps. pvmdr-1, isolates from
xishuangbanna carried mutations codons y976f f1076l, whereas isolates 
from bozhou single mutation codon f1076l.
conclusions: plasmodium vivax isolates subtropical temperate zones of
china shown dramatically different frequencies patterns of
mutations pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr-1. whereas p. vivax populations in
subtropical china highly resistant sp cq, temperate zone 
may still susceptible sp cq. information useful for
establishing treatment policy provides baseline molecular surveillance 
of drug-resistant p. vivax areas.
