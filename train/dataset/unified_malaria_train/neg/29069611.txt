disease represents specific case malfunctioning within complex system.
whereas often feasible observe possibly treat symptoms a
disease, much challenging identify characterize molecular
root causes. even infectious diseases caused known parasite, 
is often impossible pinpoint exactly molecular profiles components or
processes directly indirectly altered. however, deep understanding of
such profiles prerequisite rational, efficacious treatments. modern
omics methodologies permitting large-scale scans molecular profiles, 
but scans often yield results intuitive difficult to
interpret. instance, comparison healthy diseased transcriptome
profiles may point certain sets involved genes, host of
post-transcriptional processes regulatory mechanisms renders predictions
regarding metabolic physiological consequences observed changes gene
expression unreliable. present proof concept dynamic models of
metabolic pathway systems may offer tool interpreting transcriptomic
profiles measured disease. illustrate strategy the
interpretation expression data genes coding enzymes associated with
purine metabolism. data obtained infections rhesus macaques 
(macaca mulatta) malaria parasite plasmodium cynomolgi p. coatneyi.
the model-based interpretation reveals clear patterns flux redistribution
within purine pathway consistent two malaria pathogens
and even reflected data humans infected p. falciparum. this
