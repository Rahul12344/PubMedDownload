plasmodium falciparum (pf), causative agent malaria, iron-sulfur
cluster-containing class fumarate hydratase (fh) catalyzes the
interconversion fumarate malate, well-known reaction tricarboxylic
acid cycle. humans, reaction catalyzed class ii fh 
sequence structural homology class enzyme plasmodium fumarate 
is generated large quantities parasite by-product amp synthesis
and converted malate fh used generation key
metabolites oxaloacetate, aspartate, pyruvate. previous studies have
identified fh reaction essential p. falciparum, biochemical
characterization pffh may provide leads development specific
inhibitors lacking. here, report kinetic characterization of
purified recombinant pffh, functional complementation fh deficiency in
escherichia coli, mitochondrial localization parasite. found that
the substrate analog mercaptosuccinic acid potent pffh inhibitor, ki 
value nanomolar range. fh gene could knocked plasmodium 
berghei transfectants introduced balb/c mice; however, fh knockout
was successful c57bl/6 mice used host, suggesting the
essentiality fh gene parasite mouse strain-dependent.
