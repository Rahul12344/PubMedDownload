it discovered plasmodium knowlesi (p. knowlesi) transmitted from
macaque man. thus, aim present study determine p. knowlesi
genetic diversity human (n = 147) long-tailed macaque (n = 26)
samples high- low-endemicity localities. genotyping performed using 
seven neutral microsatellite loci markers. size alleles, multiplicity 
of infection (moi), mean number alleles (na), expected heterozygosity (he),
linkage disequilibrium (ld), genetic differentiation (fst) determined.
in highly endemic p. knowlesi localities, moi human long-tailed
macaque isolates 1.04 1.15, respectively, na 11.14 and
7.86, respectively. based allele frequency distribution loci, 
with fst < 0.1, genetic differentiation seen human long-tailed
macaque. localities characterised lower p. knowlesi endemicity, moi for
human long-tailed macaque isolates 1.05 1.11, respectively, the
na 6.14 2.71, respectively. molecular analysis allele
frequencies indicated significant genetic differentiation in
human p. knowlesi isolates compared long-tailed macaque isolates, a
very low fixation index (fst = 0.016, p < .05) based multiple loci analysis.
our results indicate that, peninsular malaysia, humans mostly
affected p. knowlesi single genotype, long-tailed macaque tend to
acquire polyclonal infections, supports assumption a
higher rate transmission among long-tailed macaque. understanding genetic 
diversity p. knowlesi isolates provide invaluable information for
characterising patterns population structure migration rate p. 
knowlesi peninsular malaysia.
