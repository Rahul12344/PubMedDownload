background: individuals living endemic areas gradually acquire natural
immunity clinical malaria, largely dependent antibodies parasite
antigens. many studies indicating variant antigen pfemp1 at
the surface parasitized red blood cell (prbc) one major targets 
of immune response. believed antibodies pfemp1 confer
protection blocking sequestration (rosetting cytoadherence), inducing
antibody-dependent cellular-inhibitory effect opsonizing prbcs for
phagocytosis.
methods: recombinant nts-dbl1α domain rosette-mediating pfemp1 was
expressed escherichia coli. resulting protein purified used for
immunization generate polyclonal (goat) monoclonal (mouse) antibodies. the
antibodies' ability opsonize induce phagocytosis vitro tested and
contrasted presence opsonizing antibodies naturally acquired during
plasmodium falciparum infection.
results: antibodies recognized recombinant antigen surface of
live prbcs, however, capacity opsonize prbcs phagocytosis
varied. monoclonal antibodies isotyped igg2b induce phagocytosis, 
while isotyped igg2a general effective, inducing
phagocytosis similar levels naturally acquired p. falciparum
infection. monoclonal antibodies displayed different patterns, them
showing concentration-dependent activity others showed prozone-like
effect. goat polyclonal antibodies able induce phagocytosis.
conclusion: immunization nts-dbl1-α domain pfemp1 generates antibodies
that biological role rosette disruption also effectively
induce opsonization phagocytosis prbcs similar activity naturally 
acquired antibodies immune individuals living malaria endemic area.
some antibodies high opsonizing activity able disrupt
rosettes, indicating epitopes nts-dbl1-α involved in
rosetting exposed prbc surface able induce functional
antibodies. ability induce phagocytosis largely depended antibody
isotype ability recognize surface prbc regardless the
rosette-disrupting capacity.
