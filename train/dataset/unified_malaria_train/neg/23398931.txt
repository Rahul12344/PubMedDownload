identifying minimal functional regions proteins malaria
parasite uses invading host cells constitutes first most
important approach effective design chemically synthesised,
multi-antigen, multi-stage, subunit-based vaccine. work aimed at
identifying pfrh1 protein binding regions (residues 1-2580) belonging 
reticulocyte binding-like (rbl p. falciparum rh [pfrh]) family implicated in
the parasite's alternative target cell invasion routes. eighteen peptide regions 
(called high activity binding peptides - habps) binding red blood cells (rbc) 
were identified peptides mapped highly robust, specific sensitive
receptor-ligand assay. habps saturable experimental conditions 
assayed alpha helix structure. polymorphism studies revealed
that six eighteen habps identified changes amino acid level
amongst seven p. falciparum strains evaluated. habps' specific binding
became altered rbc treated neuraminidase, chymotrypsin and
trypsin, suggesting differing sensitivity rbc membrane receptors. after
ascertaining rh1 gene transcribed expressed late-stage
schizonts fcb-2 strain, invasion inhibition assays carried out. 
most habps assayed p. falciparum vitro culture able
to inhibit high percentages fvo strain invasion compared low inhibition
percentages observed fcb-2 strain. data shows small rh1 regions'
participation invasion suggests units included in
further immunological structural studies.
