background: control malaria pregnancy remains major public health
challenge developing countries. microscopic parasite detection represents a
pivotal step malaria control, modern molecular techniques deemed 
improve detection rates markedly.
aims: study aimed investigate frequency submicroscopic and
multiple plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) infections pregnancy, using
the p. falciparum merozoite surface protein1 (msp-1) gene polymorphic
marker.
materials methods: study cross-sectional, analytical study was
conducted omdurman maternity hospital, sudan, july 2003 december
2004. following informed consent, 836 pregnant women ages 16-47
years different gestational ages enrolled study. thin thick 
blood films stained giemsa examined experienced microscopists.
parasite dna extracted using chelex method. nested polymerase chain reaction 
(pcr) assays specific p. falciparum carried detect infections
below threshold microscopy genotype different strains the
samples using merozoite surface protein-1.
results: quarter study participants (219/836; 26.2%) were
smear-positive malaria infection. results pcr-based assays showed 
that 41.8 % (257/617) smear-negative women pcr positive therefore
had submicroscopic infections. mean number genetically different p.
falciparum parasites detected 2.7 (range 1-9). multiplicity infection 
identified least two alleles msp-1 significantly higher among
paucigravidae (45.6%) compared multigravidae (28.9%), mean number of
alleles 2.4 1.9, respectively (p=0.009). likely indicates gradual
acquisition immunity.
conclusion: conventional microscopy underestimates actual extent malaria
infections pregnancy endemic regions. multiplicity infection may 
an important factor gradual acquisition strain-specific immunity.
