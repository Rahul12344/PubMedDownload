mosquitoes major arthropod vectors human diseases malaria 
viral encephalitis. however, mosquito species transmit every
pathogen, owing reasons include specific evolutionary histories, mosquito
immune system structure, ecology. even competent vector species a
pathogen displays wide range variation individuals pathogen
susceptibility, therefore efficiency disease transmission. understanding
the molecular genetic mechanisms determine heterogeneities in
transmission efficiency within vector species could help elaborate new vector
control strategies. review discusses mechanisms host-defense anopheles
gambiae, sources genetic ecological variation operation of
these protective factors. comparison made functional studies using
plasmodium fungus, call attention limitations generalizing
gene phenotypes experiments done single genetically simple colony.
