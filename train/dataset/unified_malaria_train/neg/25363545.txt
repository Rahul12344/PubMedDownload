background: artemisinin-based combinations currently recommended treatment of
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria many countries sub-saharan
africa substrates cyp enzymes. cytochrome enzyme system responsible
for metabolism 80-90% clinically used drugs. is, therefore,
important obtain pharmacogenetics population region with
respect combinations thereby enable practitioners predict
treatment outcomes. aim study detect determine allelic
frequencies cyp2c8*2, cyp2c8*3, cyp3a4*1b, cyp3a5*3 cyp2b6*6 variant
alleles tanzanian indigenous population.
methods: genomic dna extraction blood obtained 256 participants who
escorted patients karume health centre mwanza tanzania, carried out
using gene jet™ genomic dna purification kit (thermo scientific). genotyping 
for cytochrome p450 variant alleles performed using predesigned primers. 
amplification done pcr differentiation alleles done by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) (for cyp2c8*2, cyp2c8*3) 
sequencing (for cyp2b6*6, cyp3a5*3 cyp3a4*1b).
results: cyp2c8*2, cyp2c8*3, cyp3a5*3, cyp3a4*1b cyp2b6*6 variant allelic
frequencies found 19,10,16,78 36% respectively.
conclusion: prevalence cyp2c8*2, cyp3a5*3, cyp3a4*1b cyp2b6*6 mutations in
a tanzanian population/subjects common. impact point mutations
on metabolism anti-malarial drugs, particularly artemisinin-based
combinations, potential drug-drug interactions (ddis) needs be
further evaluated.
