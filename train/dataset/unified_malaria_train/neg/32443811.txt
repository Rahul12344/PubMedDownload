malaria remains biggest threat public health, especially among pregnant
women young children sub-saharan africa. prompt accurate diagnosis 
critical effective case management detection drug resistance.
conventionally, microscopy rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) tools of
choice malaria diagnosis. rdts simple use extensively
used diagnosis malaria among travelers malaria-endemic regions,
routine case management, surveillance studies. rdts target the
histidine-rich protein (pfhrp) exclusively found plasmodium
falciparum metabolic enzyme plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) which
is common among plasmodium species. rdts incorporate enzyme
aldolase produced plasmodium species. recently, studies have
reported false-negative rdts primarily due deletion histidine-rich 
protein (pfhrp2 pfhrp3) genes field isolates p. falciparum. herein, 
review published literature establish pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions, extent of
these deletions different geographical regions, implication malaria
control. searched publications pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions retrieved
all publications reported subject. overall, 20 publications reported
on pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions, studies done central and
south america, asia africa. studies africa that
reported occurrence pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletions rarely evaluated deletions 
on flanking genes. studies required evaluate existence and
extent gene deletions, whose presence may lead delayed missed
treatment. information guide appropriate diagnostic approaches the
respective areas.
