background: nigeria carries high burden malaria makes continuous
surveillance current information genetic diversity imperative. this
study, merozoite surface proteins (msp-1, msp-2) glutamate-rich protein
(glurp) plasmodium falciparum collected two communities representing
rural urban settings ibadan, southwestern nigeria analysed.
methods: total 511 febrile children, aged 3-59 months, whose
parents/guardians provided informed consent, recruited study.
capillary blood obtained malaria rapid diagnostic test, thick blood
smears parasite count blood spots filter paper molecular analysis.
results: three-hundred nine samples successfully genotyped msp-1,
msp-2 glurp genes. allelic distribution three genes not
significantly different rural urban communities. r033 3d7 the
most prevalent alleles rural urban communities msp-1 msp-2,
respectively. eleven glurp rii region genotypes, coded i-xii, sizes
ranging 500 1100 base pairs detected rural setting. genotype 
xi (1000-1050 bp) highest prevalence 41.5 38.5% rural urban
settings, respectively. overall, 82.1 70.0% samples multiclonal
infection msp-1 gene resulting mean multiplicity infection (moi) 
2.8 2.6 rural urban samples, respectively. msp-1 msp-2 genes
displayed higher levels diversity higher moi rates glurp gene.
conclusion: significant genetic diversity observed rural urban
parasite populations ibadan, southwestern nigeria. results study
show malaria transmission intensity regions still high. no
significant difference observed rural urban settings, except 
a completely different msp-1 allele, compared previous reports, thereby
confirming changing face malaria transmission communities. this
study provides important baseline information required monitoring impact 
of malaria elimination efforts region data points useful revising 
current protocols.
