the emergence spread southeast asia plasmodium falciparum resistance to
artemisinin (art) derivatives, cornerstone first-line artemisinin-based
combination therapies (acts), underscore urgent need identify suitable
replacement drugs. discovery development efforts identified series 
ozonides attractive chemical pharmacological properties being
touted suitable replacements. partial resistance art, defined delayed
parasite clearance malaria patients treated art derivative act, 
has associated mutations p. falciparum k13 gene. light of
reports showing art derivatives ozonides share similar modes action, 
we investigated whether parasites expressing mutant k13 cross-resistant 
to ozonides oz439 (artefenomel) oz227 (arterolane). work used a
panel culture-adapted clinical isolates cambodia genetically
edited express variant forms k13. phenotypic analyses employed ring-stage
survival assays (ring-stage survival assay 0 3 h [rsa0-3h]), whose
results earlier shown correlate parasite clearance rates in
patients. results document cross-resistance oz277 and
dihydroartemisinin (dha), semisynthetic derivative art, parasites
carrying k13 mutations c580y, r539t, i543t. oz439, observed
cross-resistance parasites carried rare k13 i543t mutation,
with evidence cross-resistance afforded prevalent c580y mutation.
mixed-culture competition experiments isogenic lines carrying modified k13
revealed variable growth deficits depending k13 mutation parasite
strain provide rationale broad dissemination fitness-neutral
k13 c580y mutation throughout strains currently circulating southeast
asia.importance acts helped halve malaria disease burden recent
years; however, emerging resistance art derivatives threatens reverse 
substantial progress. resistance driven primarily mutations the
p. falciparum k13 gene. mutations pose threat ozonides, touted as
promising alternatives arts share similar mode action. report
that dha considerably potent oz439 oz277 art-sensitive 
asexual blood-stage parasites cultured vitro also document mutant k13 
significantly compromised activity registered drug oz277. contrast,
oz439 remained effective parasite lines expressing mutant k13, 
the exception i543t merits monitoring field-based oz439
efficacy studies. k13 mutations differed considerably impact parasite
growth rates, strain-dependent context, prevalent c580y
mutation fitness neutral recently culture-adapted strains cambodia,
the epicenter emerging art resistance.
