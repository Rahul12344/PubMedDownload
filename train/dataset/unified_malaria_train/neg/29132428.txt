background: vaccine targets multiple developmental stages malaria
parasites would effective tool malaria control elimination.
methods: conserved gene plasmodium, plasmodium berghei gene
(pbanka_020570) encoding 51Â kda protein (pb51 gene), identified through
search plasmodb database using combination expression protein
localization criteria. partial domain pb51 protein expressed a
prokaryotic expression system (rpb51) used immunization mice. the
protein expression profile localization studied western blot and
indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa), respectively. inhibitory effect of
the anti-rpb51 antibodies parasite proliferation evaluated erythrocytes
in vivo. transmission-blocking activity immune sera determined 
in vitro ookinete conversion assay direct mosquito feeding assay (dfa).
results: rpb51 elicited specific antibodies mice. western blot confirmed
pb51 expression schizonts, gametocytes ookinetes. ifa showed localization 
of pb51 outer membranes schizonts, gametocytes, zygotes, retorts,
ookinetes sporozoites p. berghei. mice immunized rpb51 protein
significantly reduced parasite proliferation gametocyte conversion vivo.
moreover, rpb51 antisera also significantly reduced vitro ookinete
conversion added ookinete culture medium. dfa, mice immunized
with rpb51 reduced prevalence mosquito infection 21.3% oocyst
density 54.8%.
conclusions: p. berghei, p51 expressed asexual erythrocytic and
sexual stages localized surface stages exception 
the ring stage. anti-rpb51 antibodies inhibited p. berghei proliferation
in mice transmission parasite mosquitoes.
