subtilisin-like serine peptidases (subtilases) play important roles life
cycle many organisms, including protozoan parasites causative
agent malaria, plasmodium spp. peptidases, subtilase proteolytic
activity tightly regulated order prevent potentially deleterious 
uncontrolled protein degradation. maturation subtilases requires the
presence n-terminal propeptide facilitates folding catalytic
domain. following proteolytic cleavage, propeptide acts transient,
tightly bound inhibitor eventual complete removal generate active
protease. report identification stand-alone malaria parasite
propeptide-like protein, called sub1-prom, encoded conserved gene lies 
in highly syntenic locus adjacent three four subtilisin-like genes in
the plasmodium genome. template-based modelling ab initio structure
prediction showed sub1-prom core structure similar x-ray 
crystal structure propeptide sub1, essential parasite subtilase that
is discharged parasitophorous vacuole (pv) trigger parasite release
(egress) infected host cells. recombinant plasmodium falciparum sub1-prom
was found fast-binding, potent inhibitor p. falciparum sub1, not
of essential blood-stage parasite subtilase, sub2, other
proteases examined. mass-spectrometry immunofluorescence showed that
sub1-prom expressed pv blood stage p. falciparum, may act
as endogenous inhibitor regulate sub1 activity parasite.
