erythrocytes infected malaria parasites increased permeability nutrients 
and solutes, mediated unusual ion channel known plasmodial 
surface anion channel (psac). although increased permeability infected
erythrocytes identified 70 years ago subsequently characterized
with tracer studies, mechanism role parasite biology remained unclear 
until introduction patch-clamp methods high-throughput screening
technologies. methods discovered implicated psac primary
mechanism, determined channel essential parasite development,
led identification channel's genes, stimulated antimalarial drug
discovery target. despite advances, many questions remain
about unusual parasite channel. review highlights recent advances
and describes important questions future research.
