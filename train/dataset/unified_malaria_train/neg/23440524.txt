on july 15, 2012, adult anopheles hyrcanus (pallas 1771) mosquitoes caught
next farm barn near rust, burgenland, close lake neusiedl national park
in eastern austria. six weeks later, adults invasive species also
found sheep shelter outside village oggau another 2 weeks later, 
in horse barn mörbisch. morphological typing confirmed genetically
by amplification sequencing 1,404-bp-long fragment within 5.8s
ribosomal rna gene, internal transcribed spacer 2, 28s ribosomal rna 
gene. two a. hyrcanus pools analyzed, one found positive for
plasmodium sp. 460-bp-long sequence within mitochondrial cytochrome b
region revealed 100 % identity sequence plasmodium parasite identified 
in new zealand bellbird (anthornis melanura). austrian finding sites are
close hungarian border. hungary, occurrence a. hyrcanus was
already reported 1963. a. hyrcanus considered important potential 
vector malaria southern france today. austria, sporadic autochthonous
malaria cases could emerge, caused immigration malaria-endemic countries 
and heavy tourism. however, broad population coverage austrian health 
care system makes reestablishment endemic areas malaria unlikely.
