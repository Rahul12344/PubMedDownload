background: imported falciparum malaria africa become key public
health challenge guizhou province since 2012. understanding polymorphisms 
of molecular markers drug resistance guide selection antimalarial drugs
for treatment malaria. study aimed analyze polymorphisms
of pfcrt, pfmdr1, k13-propeller among imported falciparum malaria cases in
guizhou province, china.
method: fifty-five imported falciparum malaria cases guizhou province during
2012-2016 included study. demographic information filter
paper blood samples collected. genomic dna plasmodium falciparum was
extracted blood samples, polymorphisms pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
k13-propeller analyzed nested pcr amplification followed sequencing.
data analyzed spss17.0 software.
results: prevalence pfcrt k76t, pfmdr1 n86y, pfmdr1 y184f mutation was
56.6, 22.2, 72.2%, respectively, imported falciparum malaria cases in
guizhou province. detected two mutant haplotypes pfcrt, iet mnt, with
iet commonly found (54.7%), five mutant haplotypes pfmdr1, of
which nfd frequent (53.7%). totally 10 combined
haplotypes pfcrt pfmdr1, haplotype ietnfd possessed a
predominance 28.8%. addition, three nonsynonymous mutations (s459t, c469f, 
and v692l) two synonymous mutations (r471r v589v) detected in
k13-propeller, prevalence less 6.0%. particular, candidate
k13 resistance mutation, c469f, identified first time democratic
republic congo prevalence 2.0%.
conclusions: high prevalence iet haplotype pfcrt nfd haplotype of
pfmdr1 suggests presence chloroquine, artemether/lumefantrine, and
dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine resistance cases. therefore cautions
should made artemisinin therapy p. falciparum africa. continuous
monitoring anti-malarial drug efficacy imported malaria cases helpful
for optimizing antimalarial drug therapy guizhou province, china.
