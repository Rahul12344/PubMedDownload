anopheles gambiae well-adapted system host localization, feeding, and
mating behavior, governed neuronal processes brain.
however, published reports characterizing brain proteome to
elucidate neuronal signaling mechanisms vector. end, large-scale
mapping brain proteome an. gambiae carried using high
resolution tandem mass spectrometry, revealing repertoire >1800 proteins, of
which 15% could assigned function. large proportion the
identified proteins predicted involved diverse biological processes
including metabolism, transport, protein synthesis, olfaction. study
also led identification 10 gpcr classes proteins, could govern
sensory pathways mosquitoes. proteins involved metabolic neural
processes, chromatin modeling, synaptic vesicle transport associated with
neuronal transmission predominantly expressed brain. proteogenomic
analysis expanded findings identification 15 novel genes 71
cases gene refinements, subset validated rt-pcr and
sequencing. overall, study offers valuable insights brain physiology
of vector could possibly open avenues intervention strategies for
malaria future.
