background: duffy-null trait ethnic netropenia highly prevalent 
in africa. influence pre-seroconversion levels peripheral blood cell
counts (pbcs) risk acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1
infection among africans unknown.
methods: triangular relationship among pre-seroconversion pbc counts, host
genotypes, risk hiv acquisition determined prospective cohort 
black south african high-risk female sex workers. twenty-seven women had
seroconversion follow-up, 115 remained hiv negative 2 years,
despite engaging high-risk activity.
results: pre-seroconversion neutrophil counts women subsequently had
seroconversion significantly lower, whereas platelet counts higher,
compared remained hiv negative. comprising 27% cohort,
subjects pre-seroconversion neutrophil counts <2500 cells/mm(3) a
∼3-fold greater risk acquiring hiv infection. genome-wide association
analyses, african-specific polymorphism (rs2814778) promoter duffy
antigen receptor chemokines (darc -46t > c) significantly associated with
neutrophil counts (p = 7.9 × 10(-11)). darc -46c/c results loss darc
expression erthyrocytes (duffy-null) resistance plasmodium vivax
malaria, cohort, subjects genotype had
pre-seroconversion neutrophil counts <2500 cells/mm(3). risk acquiring 
hiv infection ∼3-fold greater trait of
duffy-null-associated low neutrophil counts, compared study
participants.
conclusions: pre-seroconversion neutrophil platelet counts influence risk 
hiv infection. trait duffy-null-associated low neutrophil counts
influences hiv susceptibility. high prevalence trait among
persons african ancestry, may contribute dynamics hiv
