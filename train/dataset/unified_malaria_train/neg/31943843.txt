smallest unit life. here, calculated proteomic atom distribution in
>1500 randomly selected species across entire current phylogenetic tree and
identified uracil-5-methyltransferase (u5mtase) protozoan parasite
plasmodium falciparum (pf, strain pf3d7), distinct atom aa
distribution pattern. determined apicoplast location silico 3d

potential therapeutic intervention malaria. around 300 million clinical
cases malaria occur year tropical subtropical regions the
world, resulting one million deaths annually, placing malaria among the
most serious infectious diseases. genomic proteomic research clades of
parasites containing pf progressing slowly functions the
∼5300 genes still unknown. applied 'bottom-up' comparative proteomic
atomics analysis across phylogenetic tree visualize protein molecule 
its actual basis - i. e., atomic level. identified protruding
pf3d7-specific u5mtase, determined 3d protein structure, identified
potential inhibitory drug molecules silico drug screening might
serve possible remedies treatment malaria. besides, this
atomic-based proteome map provides unique approach identification of
parasite-specific proteins could considered novel therapeutic targets.
