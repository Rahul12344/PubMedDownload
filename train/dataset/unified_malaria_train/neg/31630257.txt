codon usage frequency influences protein structure function. frequency
with codons used potentially impacts primary, secondary tertiary
protein structure. poor expression, loss function, insolubility, truncation
can result species-specific differences codon usage. "codon
harmonization" closely aligns native codon usage frequencies of
the expression host particularly within putative inter-domain segments where
slower rates translation may play role protein folding. heterologous
expression plasmodium falciparum genes escherichia coli a
challenge due at-rich codon bias highly repetitive dna
sequences. here, codon harmonization applied malarial antigen, celtos 
(cell-traversal protein ookinetes sporozoites). celtos highly
conserved p. falciparum protein involved cellular traversal mosquito
and vertebrate host cells. reversibly refolds thermal denaturation
making desirable malarial vaccine candidate. protein expressed e. coli
from codon harmonized sequence p. falciparum celtos (ch-pfceltos) was
compared protein expressed native codon sequence (n-pfceltos) to
assess impact codon usage protein expression levels, solubility, yield,
stability, structural integrity, recognition celtos-specific mabs and
immunogenicity mice. translated proteins expected be
identical, translated products produced codon-harmonized sequence
differed helical content showed smaller distribution polypeptides 
mass spectra indicating lower heterogeneity codon harmonized version and
fewer amino acid misincorporations. substitutions hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic
amino acid observed commonly other. ch-pfceltos induced
significantly higher antibody levels compared n-pfceltos; however, no
significant differences either ifn-Î³ il-4 cellular responses detected
