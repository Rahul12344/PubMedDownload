cerebral malaria (cm) severe complication brain vascular
hyperpermeability. claudin-5 major component tight junctions. to
investigate expression claudin-5 cm, established murine
experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) model in vitro model treating
murine brain endothelial cells (bend3) plasma ecm mice. expression of
claudin-5 ets transcription factor erg reduced brain
endothelium ecm mice. bend3 cells exposed ecm plasma, decreased
expression claudin-5 erg, increased permeability observed.
silencing erg significantly reduced cldn5 expression. chip assays indicated
that erg binds -813 ets motif murine cldn5 gene promoter, the
binding decreased treatment ecm plasma.
