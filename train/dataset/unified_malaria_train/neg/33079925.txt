the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti prolific vector arboviral and
filarial diseases largely relies sense smell find humans. to
facilitate in-depth analysis neural circuitry underlying ae. aegypti
olfactory-driven behaviors, generated updated vitro atlas the
antennal lobe olfactory brain region disease vector using two independent
neuronal staining methods. performed morphological reconstructions with
replicate fixed, dissected stained brain samples adult male female
ae. aegypti lvpib12 genome reference strain determined the
antennal lobe sexes comprised approximately 80 discrete glomeruli. 
guided landmark features antennal lobe, found 63 glomeruli 
are stereotypically located spatially invariant positions within in
vitro preparations. posteriorly positioned, mediodorsal glomerulus denoted md1 
was identified largest spatially invariant glomerulus antennal
lobe. spatial organization glomeruli recently field-derived strain ae.
aegypti puerto rico conserved, despite differences antennal lobe
shape relative inbred lvpib12 strain. model vitro atlas serve
as useful community resource improve antennal lobe annotation and
anatomically map projection patterns neurons expressing target genes this
olfactory center. also facilitate development chemotopic maps of
odor representation mosquito antennal lobe decode molecular and
cellular basis ae. aegypti attraction human scent chemosensory
cues.
