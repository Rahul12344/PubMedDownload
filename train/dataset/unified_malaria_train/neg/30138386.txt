anopheles balabacensis, primary vector plasmodium knowlesi sabah,
malaysia, zoophilic anthropophilic, feeding macaques well as
humans. dominant anopheles species found kudat division 
responsible cases p. knowlesi. however paucity basic
biological ecological information vector. investigated genetic
variation species using sequences cox1 (1,383 bp) cox2 (685
bp) gain insight population genetics inter-population gene
flow sabah. total 71 an. balabacensis collected seven districts
constituting 14 subpopulations. total 17, 10 25 haplotypes detected
in subpopulations respectively using cox1, cox2 combined
sequence. haplotypes common among subpopulations due gene
flow occurring them. amova showed genetic variation high
within subpopulations compared subpopulations. mantel test results 
showed variation subpopulations due geographical 
distance them. furthermore, tajima's fu's fs tests showed an. 
balabacensis sabah experiencing population expansion growth. high gene 
flow subpopulations indicated low genetic distance and
high gene diversity cox1, cox2 combined sequence. however the
population lipasu lama appeared isolated possibly due higher
altitude 873 sea level.
