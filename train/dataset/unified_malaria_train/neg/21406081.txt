background: plasmodium falciparum responsible acute form human
malaria. recent studies demonstrate belongs monophyletic
lineage specialized infection great ape hosts. several plasmodium
species cause human malaria. belong another distinct lineage of
parasites infect wider range primate species. known mammalian
malaria parasites appear monophyletic. clade includes two
previous distinct lineages parasites primates great apes, one lineage
of rodent parasites, presumably hepatocystis species. plasmodium falciparum
and great ape parasites commonly thought sister-group 
mammal-infecting malaria parasites. however, studies supported contradictory
origins found parasites great apes closer rodents, to
those primates.
results: distinguish mutually exclusive hypotheses origin
of plasmodium falciparum great ape infecting relatives, performed a
comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based data set three mitochondrial
genes 33 84 malaria parasites. showed malarial mitochondrial
genes evolved slowly compositionally homogeneous. estimated their
phylogenetic relationships using bayesian maximum-likelihood methods.
inferred trees checked robustness (i) site selection, (ii) 
assumptions various probabilistic models, (iii) taxon sampling. our
results robustly support common ancestry rodent parasites plasmodium
falciparum's relatives infecting great apes.
conclusions: results refute common view origin great ape
malaria parasites, instead demonstrate robustness less
well-established phylogenetic hypothesis, plasmodium falciparum and
its relatives infecting great apes closely related rodent parasites. 
study sheds light evolutionary history plasmodium falciparum, major
issue human health.
