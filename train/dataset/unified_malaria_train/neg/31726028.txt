extreme diversity major plasmodium falciparum antigen, pfemp1, poses a
barrier identifying targets immunity malaria. here, used protein
microarrays containing hundreds variants dblα domain pfemp1 cover
the diversity papua new guinean (png) parasites. probing plasma a
longitudinal cohort malaria-exposed png children showed group 2 dblα
antibodies moderately associated lower risk uncomplicated malaria,
whereas individual variants weakly associated clinical immunity.
in contrast, antibodies 85 individual group 1 2 dblα variants were
associated 70%-100% reduction severe malaria. these, 17 variants
were strong predictors severe malaria. analysis full-length pfemp1
sequences png samples shows 17 variants linked pathogenic 
cidr domains. suggests whereas immunity uncomplicated malaria
requires broad repertoire antibodies, immunity severe malaria targets a
subset conserved variants. findings provide insights antimalarial
immunity potential antibody biomarkers disease risk.
