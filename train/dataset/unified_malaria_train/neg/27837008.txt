background: pediatric acute respiratory distress tropical settings very
common. bacterial pneumonia major contributor morbidity mortality
rates requires adequate diagnosis correct treatment. rapid test that
could identify bacterial (vs other) infections would great clinical utility.
methods results: performed rna (rna-seq) sequencing analyzed the
transcriptomes 68 pediatric patients well-characterized clinical
phenotype identify transcriptional features associated disease
class. refined features predictive models (support vector machine,
elastic net) validated models independent test set 37 patients
(80%-85% accuracy).
conclusions: identified sets genes differentially expressed
in pediatric patients pneumonia syndrome attributable different
infections requiring different therapeutic interventions. findings this
study demonstrate human transcription signatures infected patients
recapitulate underlying biology provide models predicting bacterial
diagnosis inform treatment.
