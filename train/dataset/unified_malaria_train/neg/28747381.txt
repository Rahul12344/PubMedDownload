understanding phenotypic differences males females arise the
sex-biased expression nearly identical genomes reveal important insights
into biology evolution species. among anopheles mosquito species,
these phenotypic differences include vectorial capacity, females
that blood feed thus transmit human malaria. here, use rna-seq data from
multiple tissues four vector species spanning anopheles phylogeny to
explore genomic evolutionary properties sex-biased genes. find
that, mosquitoes, contrast found many other
organisms, female-biased genes rapidly evolving sequence, expression,
and genic turnover male-biased genes. results suggest atypical
pattern may due combination sex-specific life history challenges
encountered females, blood feeding. furthermore, female propensity 
mate nature male swarms likely diminishes sexual selection of
post-reproductive traits related sperm competition among males. also
develop comparative framework systematically explore tissue- and
sex-specific splicing document conservation throughout genus and
identify set candidate genes future functional analyses sex-specific 
isoform usage. finally, data reveal deficit male-biased genes 
the x chromosomes anopheles conserved feature genus be
directly attributed chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation that
de-masculinizes x male reproductive tissues.
