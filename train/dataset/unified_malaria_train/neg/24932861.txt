background: rapid scale-up malaria vector control last
ten years. primary control strategies, long-lasting pyrethroid
treated nets indoor residual spraying, rely use limited number of
insecticides. insecticide resistance, measured bioassay, rapidly
increased prevalence come forefront issue needs to
be addressed maintain sustainability malaria control drive to
elimination. zambia's programme reported high levels resistance the
insecticides used 2010, and, result, increased investment in
resistance monitoring support informed resistance management decisions.
methodology/principal findings: country-wide survey insecticide resistance
in zambian malaria vectors performed using bioassays detect resistant 
phenotypes. molecular techniques used detect target-site mutations and
microarray detect metabolic resistance mechanisms. anopheles gambiae s.s. 
resistant pyrethroids, ddt carbamates, potential organophosphate
resistance one population. resistant phenotypes conferred both
target-site metabolic mechanisms. anopheles funestus s.s. largely
resistant pyrethroids carbamates, potential resistance ddt two 
locations. resistant phenotypes conferred elevated levels of
cytochrome p450s.
conclusions/significance: currently, zambia national malaria control centre
is using results inform vector control strategy. methods
employed serve template malaria-endemic countries striving
to create sustainable insecticide resistance management plan.
