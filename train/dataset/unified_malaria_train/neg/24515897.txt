objective: spinal muscular atrophy (sma) one common severe
hereditary diseases infancy early childhood north america, europe, 
asia. sma usually caused deletions survival motor neuron 1 (smn1)
gene. closely related gene, smn2, modifies disease severity. sma carriers
have 1 copy smn1 relatively common (1 30-50) populations of
european asian descent. smn copy numbers sma carrier frequencies not
been reliably estimated malians sub-saharan africans.
methods: used quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay determine smn1
and smn2 copy numbers 628 malians, 120 nigerians, 120 kenyans. also
explored possible mechanisms smn1 smn2 copy number differences in
malians, investigated effects smn mrna protein levels.
results: sma carrier frequency malians 1 209, lower in
eurasians. malians sub-saharan africans likely ≥3
copies smn1 eurasians, likely lack smn2 europeans. there
was evidence gene conversion, gene locus duplication, natural selection 
from malaria resistance account higher smn1 copy numbers malians.
high smn1 copy numbers associated increased smn mrna protein
levels human cell lines.
interpretation: sma carrier frequencies much lower sub-saharan africans
than eurasians. finding important consider sma genetic
counseling individuals black african ancestry.
