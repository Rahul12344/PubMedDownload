background: many diseases transmitted mosquitoes, including malaria,
dengue fever, yellow fever, filariasis, west nile fever. chemical control
plays major role managing mosquito-borne diseases. however, excessive and
continuous application insecticides caused development insecticide 
resistance many species including mosquito, become major
obstacle controlling mosquito-borne diseases. insecticide resistance the
result complex polygenic inheritance, mechanisms well
understood. ribosomal protein rps29 found associated dm resistance
in previous study. study, aim investigate the
involvement rps29 deltamethrin resistance.
methodology principal findings: study, tandem affinity purification
was used identify proteins interact rps29. among candidate
proteins, cyp6n3, member cyp450 superfamily, identified, binding
to rps29 confirmed vitro vivo gst pull-down and
immunofluorescence. cck-8 assay used investigate rps29-ctp6n3
interaction relation dm resistance. cyp6n3 overexpression significantly
enhanced dm resistance insect cell viability, reversed rps29 
overexpression. western blot used study mechanism interaction
between rps29 cyp6n3. rps29 increases cyp6n3 protein degradation 
proteasome.
conclusions significance: observations indicate cyp6n3, novel
rps29-interacting partner, could stimulate deltamethrin resistance mosquito
cells rps29 overexpression targeted cyp6n3 proteosomal degradation,
abrogating cyp6n3-associated resistence deltamethrin. findings provide
a novel mechanism associated cyp450s mediated dm resistance.
