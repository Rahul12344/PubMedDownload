in study, investigated modalities coding open reading frame (corf)
classification expressed sequence tags (est) using universal feature
method (ufm). ufm algorithm based scoring purine bias (rrr) 
stop codon frequencies. ufm classifies orfs coding non-coding a
score based 5 factors: (i) stop codon frequency; (ii) product the
probabilities purines occurring three positions nucleotide triplets;
(iii) product probabilities cytosine (c), guanine (g), adenine 
(a) occurring 1st, 2nd, 3rd positions triplets, respectively; (iv) 
the probabilities g occurring 1st 2nd positions triplets; 
(v) probabilities occurring 1st 2nd position of
triplets. ufm based primary determinants coding sequences that
are conserved throughout biosphere, suitable corf classification of
any sequence eukaryote transcriptomes without prior knowledge. considering the
protein sequences protein data bank (rcsb pdb simply pdb) a
reference, found ufm classifies corfs ≥200 bp (if coding strand is
known) corfs ≥300 bp (if coding strand unknown), releases 
in coding strand coding frame, allows automatic translation
into protein sequences success rate equal higher 95%. first 
established statistical parameters ufm using ests plasmodium
falciparum, arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, zea mays, drosophila
melanogaster, homo sapiens chlamydomonas reinhardtii reference the
protein sequences pdb. second, showed success rate corf
classification using ufm expected apply approximately 95% higher
eukaryote genes encode proteins. third, used ufm combination 
cap3 assemble large est samples corfs used analyze
transcriptome phenotypes rice, maize, humans. discuss error rate
and interference noisy sequences pseudogenes, transposons, and
retrotransposons. method suitable rapid corf extraction from
transcriptome data allows correct description genome phenotypes of
plant genomes without prior knowledge. additional care necessary when
addressing human transcriptome due interference caused large
amounts noisy sequences. ufm regarded low complexity tool for
prior knowledge extraction concerning coding fraction transcriptome of
any eukaryote. due low level complexity, ufm also robust to
variations codon usage.
