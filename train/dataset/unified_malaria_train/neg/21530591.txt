use yeast two-hybrid assay study plasmodium falciparum protein-protein 
interactions limited poor expression p. falciparum genes yeast and
lack easily implemented assays confirm results. report two
methods create gene fragments - random fragmentation partial dnase i
digestion generation densely overlapping fragments pcr - enable
most portions p. falciparum genes expressed screened yeast
two-hybrid assay. pcr-based method less technically challenging and
facilitates fine-scale mapping protein interaction domains. approaches
revealed putative interaction pfmyb2 (pf10_0327) pfc0365w. we
developed new plasmids express proteins wheat germ extracts and
confirmed interaction split-luciferase assay in
co-purification experiments glutathione-s-transferase ha-tagged
proteins. combination improved yeast two-hybrid screening approaches and
convenient systems validate interactions enhances utility yeast
two-hybrid assays p. falciparum.
