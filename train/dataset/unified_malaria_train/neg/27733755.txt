as one three major human pathogens cause schistosomiasis, schistosoma
japonicum one endemic china. despite great progress on
schistosomiasis control past 50 years china, s. japonicum
transmission still occurs certain endemic regions, causes significant
public health problems enormous economic losses. different life
stages, parasites able survive dramatic osmolality changes its
vector, fresh water, mammal host. however, molecular mechanism of
parasite osmoregulation remains unknown. address challenging question, we
report first cloning s. japonicum aquaglyceroporin (sjaqp) an
isolate jiangsu province, china. expressing sjaqp xenopus oocytes
facilitated permeation water, glycerol, urea. water permeability
of sjaqp inhibited 1 mm hgcl2, 3 mm tetraethylammonium, 1 mm zncl2, and
1 mm cuso4. sjaqp constitutively expressed throughout s. japonicum life
cycle, including egg, miracidia, cercaria, adult stages. highest
expression detected infective cercaria stage. results suggest 
that sjaqp plays role osmoregulation throughout s. japonicum life cycle,
especially cercariae transformation, enables parasites survive
osmotic challenges.
