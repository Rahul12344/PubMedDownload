recent advances genetics systems biology technologies promoted our
understanding biology malaria parasites molecular level.
however, effective malaria parasite targets vaccine chemotherapy
development still limited. largely due unavailability of
relevant practical vivo infection models human plasmodium species,
most notably p. falciparum p. vivax. therefore, rodent malaria species
have extensively used practical alternative vivo models malaria
vaccine, drug targeting, immune response, functional characterization studies
of conserved plasmodiumspp. genes. indeed, rodent malaria models proven to
be invaluable, especially exploring mosquito transmission liver stage
biology, indispensable immunological studies. however, are
discrepancies methods used evaluate phenotypes transgenic and
wild-type asexual sexual blood-stage parasites. examples these
discrepancies choice intravenous vs. intraperitoneal infection of
rodents blood-stage parasites evaluation male gamete
exflagellation. herein, detail standardized experimental methods evaluate
the phenotypes asexual sexual blood stages transgenic parasites
expressing reporter-gene wild-type rodent malaria parasite species. also
detail methods evaluate phenotypes malaria parasite mosquito stages
(gametes, ookinetes, oocysts, sporozoites) inside anopheles mosquito vectors.
these methods detailed simplified lethal non-lethal
strains p. berghei p. yoelii also applied adjustments
to p. chabaudi p. vinckei rodent malaria species.
