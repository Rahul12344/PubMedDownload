metabolomics offers powerful means investigate human malaria parasite
biology host-parasite interactions biochemical level, discover 
novel therapeutic targets biomarkers infection. here, used approach 
based liquid chromatography mass spectrometry perform untargeted
metabolomic analysis metabolite extracts plasmodium falciparum-infected
and uninfected patient plasma samples, enriched population in
vitro cultured p. falciparum-infected uninfected erythrocytes. statistical
modeling robustly segregated infected uninfected samples based metabolite 
species significantly different abundances. metabolites α-linolenic
acid (ala) pathway, known exist plants known exist p.
falciparum now, enriched infected plasma erythrocyte samples.
in vitro labeling (13)c-ala showed evidence plant-like ala pathway
intermediates p. falciparum. ortholog searches using ala pathway enzyme
sequences 8 available plant genomes identified several genes p.
falciparum genome predicted potentially encode corresponding
enzymes hitherto unannotated p. falciparum pathway. data suggest
that approach used discover novel facets host/malaria parasite
biology high-throughput manner.
