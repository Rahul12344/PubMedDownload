hookworms. functions cap superfamily members poorly understood,
but one form, hookworm platelet inhibitor (hpi), isolated a
putative antagonist platelet integrins αiibβ3 α2β1. here, crystal 
structure hpi described structural features examined in

of hpi crystal contains dimer extensive interaction interface, 
chromatographic measurements indicate primarily monomeric solution.
in dimeric structure, putative active-site cleft areas monomers
are united single negatively charged depression. potential lys-gly-asp
