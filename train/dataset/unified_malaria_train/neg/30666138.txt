vector-borne infectious diseases continue major threat public health. 
although prevention treatment modalities exist diseases,
resistance modalities, exacerbated global climate change, remains a
fundamental challenge. developments genomic engineering technologies present a
new front battling vector-borne illnesses; however, lack of
consensus scope consequences approaches. article,
we use malaria case study address developments controversies
surrounding gene drives, novel genomic engineering technology. draw
attention themes infection control, resistance, reversibility using
a science technology studies framework. unlike current prevention and
treatment modalities, gene drives capacity alter single
organisms also entire species ecologies. therefore, broader public and
scientific engagement needed inform inclusive discussion between
clinicians, researchers, policy makers, society.
