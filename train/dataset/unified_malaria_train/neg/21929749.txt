background: variant antigens expressed surface parasitized red blood
cells (prbcs) important virulence factors malaria parasites. whereas
plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (pfemp1) responsible
for sequestration mature parasites, little known putative ligands
mediating cytoadherence host receptors plasmodium species. candidates
include members pir superfamily found human parasite plasmodium
vivax (vir), simian pathogen plasmodium knowlesi (kir) rodent
malarias plasmodium yoelii (yir), plasmodium berghei (bir) plasmodium
chabaudi (cir). aim study reveal potential involvement of
cir genes p. chabaudi sequestration.
methods: subfamilies cir genes identified bioinformatic analyses of
annotated sequence data plasmodium genome database. order examine
tissue-specific differences expression cir mrnas, rt-pcr with
subfamily-specific primers used. total, 432 cdna clones derived six
different tissues sequenced characterize transcribed cir gene
repertoire. confirm differences transcription profiles cir genes,
restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses performed to
compare different host tissues identify changes course p.
chabaudi infections immunocompetent mice.
results: phylogenetic analysis annotated p. chabaudi putative cir proteins
identified two major subfamilies. comparison transcribed cir genes six
different tissues revealed significant differences frequency clones
belonging individual cir gene subgroups obtained different tissues. 
further hints difference transcription cir genes individual
tissues obtained rflp. whereas minimal changes transcription 
pattern cir genes could detected developmental cycle the
parasites, switching expression cir genes course an
infection observed around peak parasitemia.
conclusions: tissue-specific expression cir mrnas found study
indicates correlation expression cir antigens distribution of
parasites inner organs. together comparable results members 
the pir superfamily suggests role cir pir genes antigenic 
variation sequestration malaria parasites.
