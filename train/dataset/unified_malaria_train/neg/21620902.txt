the antimalarial activity antibiotic thiostrepton long attributed
to inhibition apicoplast protein synthesis binding apicoplast
ribosomal rna. however, kinetics parasite death upon thiostrepton
treatment differ seen inhibitors apicoplast housekeeping 
functions. analysed global changes gene expression malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, attempt shed light responses 
the parasite drug. results indicate delay gene expression
profiles thiostrepton-treated parasites. small number genes appear 
regulated outside trend; data suggest response genes encoding 
components mitochondrial translational machinery, little response is
seen genes encoding apicoplast-targeted proteins. findings are
consistent effect thiostrepton mitochondrial protein synthesis, and
thus warrant re-evaluation target thiostrepton plasmodium. they
also provide suggestion mitochondrion-nucleus signalling parasite.
