background: anopheles sinensis important malaria vector southeast asia. 
the widespread emergence insecticide resistance mosquito species poses
a serious threat efficacy malaria control measures, particularly in
china. recently, whole-genome sequencing de novo assembly an. sinensis
(china strain) finished. series insecticide-resistant studies in
an. sinensis also reported. growing need integrate 
valuable data provide comprehensive database studies on
insecticide-resistant management an. sinensis.
results: bioinformatics database named an. sinensis genome database (asgdb) was
built. addition searchable database published an. sinensis
genome sequences annotation, asgdb provides in-depth analytical platforms for
further understanding genomic genetic data, including visualization of
genomic data, orthologous relationship analysis, go analysis, pathway analysis,
expression analysis resistance-related gene analysis. moreover, asgdb
provides panoramic view insecticide resistance studies an. sinensis in
china. total, 551 insecticide-resistant phenotypic genotypic reports on
an. sinensis distributed chinese malaria-endemic areas since mid-1980s
have collected, manually edited format integrated into
openlayers map-based interface, allows international community to
assess exploit high volume scattered data much easier. database
has given url: http://www.asgdb.org /.
conclusions: asgdb built help users mine data genome sequence 
an. sinensis easily effectively, especially advantages in
insecticide resistance surveillance control.
