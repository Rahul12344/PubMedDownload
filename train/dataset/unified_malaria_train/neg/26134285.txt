mtor inhibitors used treat metastatic renal cell cancer (rcc), most
patients eventually become resistant. one possible mechanism resistance is
upregulation autophagy, pathway helps recycle intracellular proteins
and promotes cell survival. hydroxychloroquine (hcq), potent autophagy
inhibitor used treat malaria autoimmune disorders, currently being
studied context cancer treatment. here, investigated the
effects hcq three different renal carcinoma derived cell lines. found
that hcq treatment inhibits rcc cell growth, promotes apoptosis, inhibits
mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increases rates glycolysis. to
understand molecular mechanism behind effects, examined various
nodes mtor pathway compared effects hcq effects the
mtor inhibitor rad001. key downstream readout pathway, phospho-s6
protein, inhibited hcq rad001. however, upstream kinase,
p70s6k inhibited rad001 hcq, suggesting block hcq
was downstream p70s6k. treatment proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
restored phospho-s6 levels, suggesting reduction phospho-s6 caused
by increased degradation phospho-s6, total s6. surprisingly, treatment
with autophagy inhibitors exhibit effects. findings
suggest hcq causes down-regulation phospho-s6 rcc cell lines via a
novel mechanism shared autophagy inhibitors.
