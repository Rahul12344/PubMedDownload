background: advent next generation sequencing technology accelerated
efforts map catalogue copy number variation (cnv) genomes important 
micro-organisms public health. typical analysis sequence data
involves mapping reads onto reference genome, calculating respective
coverage, detecting regions too-low too-high coverage (deletions 
amplifications, respectively). current cnv detection methods rely statistical 
assumptions (e.g., poisson model) may hold general, require
fine-tuning underlying algorithms detect known hits. propose new cnv 
detection methodology based two poisson hierarchical models, poisson-gamma
and poisson-lognormal, advantage sufficiently flexible to
describe different data patterns, whilst robust deviations often
assumed poisson model.
results: using sequence coverage data 7 plasmodium falciparum malaria genomes 
(3d7 reference strain, hb3, dd2, 7g8, gb4, ox005, ox006), showed that
empirical coverage distributions intrinsically asymmetric overdispersed
in relation poisson model. also demonstrated low baseline false
positive rate proposed methodology using 3d7 resequencing data and
simulation. applied non-reference isolate data, approach detected
known cnv hits, including amplification pfmdr1 locus dd2 large
deletion clag3.2 gene gb4, putative novel cnv regions. when
compared recently available freec cn.mops approaches, findings
were concordant putative hits highest quality array data for
the 7g8 gb4 isolates.
conclusions: summary, proposed methodology brings increase in
flexibility, robustness, accuracy statistical rigour cnv detection using
sequence coverage data.
