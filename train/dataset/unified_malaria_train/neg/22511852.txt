the var gene family plasmodium falciparum encodes immunodominant variant
surface antigens pfemp1. highly polymorphic proteins important
virulence factors mediate cytoadhesion variety host tissues, causing
sequestration parasitized red blood cells vital organs, including brain
or placenta. acquisition variant-specific antibodies correlates with
protection severe malarial infections; however, understanding the
relationship gene expression infection outcome complicated 
modular genetic architectures var genes encode varying numbers of
antigenic domains differential binding specificities. analyzing the
domain architectures fully sequenced var gene repertoires reveal a
significant, non-random association number domains comprising a
var gene sequence conservation. such, var genes grouped 
those short diverse genes long conserved,
suggesting gene length important characteristic classification of
var genes. use evolutionary framework demonstrate same
evolutionary forces acting level individual gene may also
shaped parasite's gene repertoire. observed associations sequence
conservation, gene architecture repertoire structure thus explained by
a trade-off optimizing within-host fitness minimizing between-host
immune selection pressure. results demonstrate simple evolutionary
mechanisms explain var gene structuring multiple levels important
implications understanding multifaceted epidemiology p. falciparum
malaria.
