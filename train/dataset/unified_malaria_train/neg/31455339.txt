background: potential benefits long-acting injectable chemoprotection
(lai-c) malaria recently recognized, prompting call for
suitable candidate drugs help meet need. basis known
pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic profiles oral dosing, elq-331, a
prodrug parasite mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor elq-300, was
selected study pharmacokinetics efficacy lai-c mice.
methods: four trials conducted mice injected single
intramuscular dose elq-331 elq-300 prodrugs sesame oil 1.2%
benzyl alcohol; elq-300 content doses ranged 2.5 30 mg/kg.
initial blood stage challenges plasmodium yoelii used establish 
model, definitive study measure efficacy outcome sporozoite 
challenge luciferase-expressing p. yoelii, assessed whole-body live
animal imaging. snapshot determinations plasma elq-300 concentration
([elq-300]) made prodrug injections; highest dose of
elq-331 (equivalent 30 mg/kg elq-300), [elq-331] [elq-300] were
measured series timepoints 6 h 5½ months injection.
results: single intramuscular injection elq-331 outperformed four other
elq-300 prodrugs and, dose equivalent 30 mg/kg elq-300, protected mice
against challenge p. yoelii sporozoites least 4½ months.
pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed rapid essentially complete conversion 
elq-331 elq-300, rapidly achieved (< 6 h) sustained (4-5 months)
effective plasma elq-300 concentration, maximum elq-300 concentrations far 
the estimated threshold toxicity, distinctive elq-300 concentration
versus time profile. pharmacokinetic modeling indicates high-capacity,
slow-exchange tissue compartment serves accumulate slowly
redistribute elq-300 blood, property facilitates extremely long 
period elq-300 concentration sustained minimum
fully-protective threshold (60-80 nm).
conclusions: extrapolation results humans predicts elq-331
should capable meeting far-exceeding currently published
duration-of-effect goals anti-malarial lai-c. furthermore, distinctive
pharmacokinetic profile elq-300 treatment elq-331 may facilitate
durable protection enable protection far longer 3 months. these
findings suggest elq-331 warrants consideration leading prototype for
lai-c.
