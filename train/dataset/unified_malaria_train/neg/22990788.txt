due a/t-richness genome plasmodium falciparum, expressing p.
falciparum proteins heterologous expression systems challenging. in
addition, many p. falciparum proteins high cysteine content high
molecular weight, complicates expression proteins in
heterologous systems. high molecular weight plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) adhesins expressed surface infected
erythrocytes among difficult proteins express. cost reduction 
synthetic gene synthesis, well improved eukaryotic expression systems, 
makes possible express proteins. chapter, describe the
construction, production, purification, functional assessment the
full-length extracellular region var2csa pfemp1 protein involved in
pregnancy-associated malaria (pam), using human embryonic kidney (hek)
expression system.
