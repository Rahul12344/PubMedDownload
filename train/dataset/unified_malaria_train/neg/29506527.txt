background: plasmodium vivax malaria historically major source of
disease henan, china. 1970s, morbidity malaria highest in
the country. support government efforts healthcare
personnel, reported malaria cases declined dramatically national
elimination programme launched 2010. achieve goal, essential 
to study diversity autochthonous malaria transmission plasmodium
parasites, provide baseline data disease control management.
methods: thirty-two p. vivax isolates henan province collected from
2008 2011, circumsporozoite protein (csp) genes analysed estimate 
the genetic diversity parasite.
results: assessment csp sequences indicated isolates the
vk210 type, however, none identical vk210 strain. the
sequences displayed variations central region, eight sub-types were
observed. among sub-types, hn7 prevalent (37.5%), followed by
hn3 (34.4%). total 653 repeat units discovered 32 henan isolates.
nucleotide sequences grouped 13 unique repeat nucleotide sequence
allotypes coded 7 different repeated amino acid allotypes. b (gngaggqaa)
and (gdraagqpa) frequent based results; represented 53.9%
(352/653) total. comparison basic repeat units vk210, more
than 75% central repeat units least one non-synonymous nucleotide
change.
conclusions: recent p. vivax populations henan province showed degree 
genetic diversity csp, 8 sub-types among 32 samples. meantime, the
results also suggested relative conserved parasite populations. could
provide interesting baseline data allow identifying whether potential new
cases differ parasites already circulating area.
