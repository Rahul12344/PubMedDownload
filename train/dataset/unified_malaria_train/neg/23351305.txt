phenotypic variation genetically identical malaria parasites emerging
topic. although antigenic variation part global parasite
strategy create adaptation epigenetically controlled transcriptional
variability, central mechanism enabling immune evasion promoting
pathogenesis. var gene family best-studied example wide range 
clonally variant gene families plasmodium falciparum. unique its
strict selection single member activation, process termed monoallelic 
expression. conceptual advances emerged studying var genes
show striking common epigenetic features many clonally variant gene
families even single-copy genes show variegated expression parasite 
populations. however, major mechanistic questions, existence a
potential expression site identity transcription factors genetic
elements driving singular gene choice, still unanswered. review we
discuss recent findings molecular processes essential clonal
variation, namely silencing, activation, poising switching. integrating
findings clonally variant gene families mutually exclusive
expression systems hopefully drive mechanistic understanding antigenic
variation.
