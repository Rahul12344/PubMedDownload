amidst technical challenges limit successful culture genetic
manipulation p. vivax parasites, used computational approach identify 
a critical target evolutionary significance. putative circumsporozoite
protein chromosome 13 p. vivax (pvpucsp)is distinct well-known
vaccine candidate pfcsp. aim study understand role of
pvpucsp relatedness well-known csp. study revealed pvpucsp 
a membrane bound e3 ubiquitin ligase involved ubiquitination. a
species-specific tetra-peptide unit differentially repeated various
p. vivax strains. pvpucsp different csp terms stage-specific
expression function. since e3 ubiquitin ligases known antimalarial drug
targets targeting proteasome pathway, pvpucsp, evolutionary connotation 
and key role orchestrating protein degradation p. vivax, explored 
as potential drug target.
