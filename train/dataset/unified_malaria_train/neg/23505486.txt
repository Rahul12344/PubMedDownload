primaquine, 8-aminoquinoline, drug cures dormant
hypnozoites persistent liver stages p. vivax. increasing resistance needs
the discovery alternative pathways drug targets develop novel drug
entities. deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (dohh) completes hypusine biosynthesis in
eukaryotic initiation factor (eif-5a) cellular protein known to
contain unusual amino acid hypusine. modified eif-5a important for
proliferation malaria parasite. here, present first successful
cloning expression dohh p. vivax causing tertiary malaria. the
nucleic acid sequence 1041 bp encodes open reading frame 346 amino
acids. histidine tagged expression p. vivax dohh detected protein 39.01
kda e. coli. dohh protein p. vivax shares significant amino acid
identity simian orthologues p. knowlesi p. yoelii strain h. in
contrast p. falciparum four e-z-type heat-like repeats present p. 
vivax dohh different homology phycocyanin lyase subunits from
cyanobacteria proteins participating energy metabolism archaea and
halobacteria. however, phycocyanin lyase activity absent p. vivax dohh. the
dohh gene present single copy gene transcribed throughout whole
erythrocytic cycle. specific inhibition recombinant p. vivax dohh possible 
by complexing ferrous iron zileuton, inhibitor mammalian
5-lipoxygenase (5-lox). ferrous iron active site 5-lox coordinated
by three conserved histidines carboxylate isoleucine(673). zileuton
inhibited p. vivax dohh protein ic50 12,5 nmol determined a
relative quantification gc/ms. contrast, human orthologue less 
affected ic50 90 nmol suggesting selective iron-complexing strategy 
for parasitic enzyme.
