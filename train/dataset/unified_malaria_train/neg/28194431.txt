pathogen-specific polyfunctional cell responses associated with
favorable clinical outcomes, known whether molecular differences
exist polyfunctional monofunctional cytokine-producing cells. here,
we report polyfunctional cd4+ cells induced plasmodiumfalciparum
(p. falciparum) blood-stage infection humans unique transcriptomic
profile compared ifn-γ monofunctional cd4+ cells and, thus, are
molecularly distinct. 14-gene signature revealed p. falciparum-reactive
polyfunctional cells associated cytokine signaling lymphocyte
chemotaxis, systems biology analysis identified il-27 upstream
regulator polyfunctional gene signature. importantly, polyfunctional
gene signature largely conserved influenza-reactive polyfunctional cd4+ t
cells, suggesting polyfunctional cells core characteristics
independent pathogen specificity. study provides first evidence to
our knowledge consistent molecular differences exist polyfunctional 
and monofunctional cd4+ cells.
