background: vector control remains important tool prevent malaria
transmission. however, severely constrained appearance of
physiological behavioral insecticide resistance. therefore, development
of new vector control tools warranted. tools could include immunization
of blood hosts vector mosquitoes mosquito proteins involved midgut
homeostasis (anti-mosquito vaccines) genetic engineering mosquitoes that
can drive population-wide knockout genes producing proteins reduce
mosquito lifespan malaria transmission probability.
methods: achieve this, candidate genes related midgut homeostasis
regulation need assessed effect mosquito survival. here,
different candidate genes silenced dsrna injection the
naturally occurring anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes effect mosquito
survival evaluated.
results: significantly higher mortality rates observed mosquitoes
silenced fn3d1 (aara003032), fn3d3 (aara007751) gprgr9 (aara003963) genes
as compared control group injected dsrna non-related
bacterial gene (lacz). observed difference mortality rate the
candidate genes control disappeared gene-silenced mosquitoes were
treated antibiotic mixtures, suggesting gut microbiota play key role 
in observed reduction mosquito survival.
conclusions: demonstrated interference expression fn3d1, 
fn3d3 gprgr9 genes causes significant reduction longevity an.
arabiensis mosquito wild.
