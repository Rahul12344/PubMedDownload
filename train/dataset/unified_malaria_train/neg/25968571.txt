transmission tropical africa temperate regions europe. nuclear sequence
data isolates infected sgs1 (based merozoite surface protein 1
(msp1) allelic diversity) provided new insights distribution and
transmission areas allelic variants. example, msp1 alleles
transmitted africa differ transmitted europe, suggesting the
existence two populations sgs1 lineages. however, study analysed the
distribution african european transmitted alleles afro-palearctic
migratory birds. aim, used highly variable molecular marker to
investigate whether juvenile house martins become infected europe their
first migration africa. explored msp1 allelic diversity p. relictum 
in adult juvenile house martins. found juveniles infected with
sgs1 first weeks life, confirming active transmission sgs1 
house martins europe. moreover, found juveniles of
adults infected one european transmitted msp1 allele, whereas two adult
birds infected two african transmitted msp1 alleles. findings
suggest house martins exposed different strains p. relictum in
their winter breeding quarters.
