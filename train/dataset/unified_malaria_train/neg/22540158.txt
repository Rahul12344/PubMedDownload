background: resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) plasmodium
falciparum parasites associated mutations dihydrofolate reductase 
(dhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes spread worldwide. sp
remains recommended drug intermittent preventive treatment malaria in
pregnancy (iptp) information population prevalence sp resistance
molecular markers pregnant women limited.
methods: temporal trends sp resistance molecular markers investigated 
489 parasite samples collected pregnant women delivery three
different observational studies 1996 2009 kenya, sp was
adopted iptp case treatment policies 1998. using real-time
polymerase chain reaction, pyrosequencing direct sequencing, 10
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) sp resistance molecular markers were
assayed.
results: prevalence quintuple mutant (dhfr n51i/c59r/s108n dhps
a437g/k540e combined genotype) increased 7% first study (1996-2000)
to 88% third study (2008-2009). stratified sample
collection year adoption iptp policy, prevalence quintuple
mutant increased 2.4% 1998 44.4% three years iptp policy
adoption, seemingly parallel increase percentage sp use in
pregnancy. however, 1996-2000 study, mutations combined
dhfr/dhps genotype associated sp use pregnancy in
univariable analysis associations detected 2002-2008 and
2008-2009 studies. addition, 2008-2009 study, 5.3% parasite
samples carried dhps triple mutant (a437g/k540e/a581g). no
differences prevalence sp mutant genotypes parasite samples
from hiv + hiv- women time paired peripheral placental
samples.
conclusions: significant increase dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant and
the emergence new genotype containing dhps 581 parasites pregnant 
women western kenya 13 years. iptp adoption sp use pregnancy 
played minor role increased drug-resistant parasites pregnant
women time. likely, major factors, high prevalence of
resistant parasites selected use sp case management large
non-pregnant population, might contributed temporally increased
prevalence sp resistant parasites pregnant women. investigations
are needed determine linkage sp drug resistance markers and
efficacy iptp-sp.
