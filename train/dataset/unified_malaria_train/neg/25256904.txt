detection sub-microscopic parasitemia crucial malaria elimination
programs. pcr-based methods proven sensitive, two rounds of
amplification (nested pcr) often needed detect presence plasmodium 
dna. simplify detection process, designed nested pcr method whereby
only primary pcr required detection four major human
plasmodium species. primers designed detection fifth species,
plasmodium knowlesi, included study due absence of
appropriate field samples. compared standard 18s rdna pcr method, our
cytochrome c oxidase iii (cox3) method detected 10-50% cases while
maintaining high sensitivities (1.00) four plasmodium species our
samples vanuatu (n=77) kenya (n=76). improvement detection efficiency
was substantial samples sub-microscopic parasitemia (54%) than
those observable parasitemia (10-16%). method contribute to
improved malaria surveillance low endemicity settings.
