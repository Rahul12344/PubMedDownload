fusions first two enzymes pentose phosphate pathway,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6pgl),
have previously described two distant clades, chordates species of
the malarial parasite plasmodium. analyzed genome expressed sequence 
data variety organisms identify origins gene fusion
events. based orientation domains range species which
homologs found, fusions appear occurred independently, near
the base metazoan apicomplexan lineages. one two metazoan 
paralogs g6pd fused, showing fusion occurred duplication
event, traced back ancestor choanoflagellates and
metazoans. plasmodium genes known contain functionally important
insertion seen apicomplexan fusions, highlighting this
as unique characteristic group. surprisingly, search revealed two
additional fusion events, one combined 6pgl g6pd ancestor the
protozoan parasites trichomonas giardia, another fusing g6pd with
phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd) species diatoms. study extends
the range species known contain fusions pentose phosphate pathway to
many new medically economically important organisms.
