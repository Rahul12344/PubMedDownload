birds order anseriformes, commonly referred waterfowl, are
frequently infected haemosporidia genera haemoproteus, plasmodium, 
leucocytozoon via dipteran vectors. analyzed nucleotide sequences the
cytochrome b (cytb) gene parasites genera detected six species
of ducks alaska california, usa characterize genetic diversity of
haemosporidia infecting waterfowl two ends pacific americas flyway. 
addition, parasite cytb sequences compared available public
database investigate specificity genetic lineages hosts order
anseriformes. haplotype nucleotide diversity haemoproteus cytb sequences
was lower detected plasmodium leucocytozoon parasites. although 
waterfowl presumed infected single species leucocytozoon, 
l. simondi, diversity indices highest haplotypes genus and
sequences formed five distinct clades separated genetic distances of
4.9%-7.6%, suggesting potential cryptic speciation. haemoproteus and
leucocytozoon haplotypes derived waterfowl samples formed monophyletic
clades phylogenetic analyses unique order anseriformes with
few exceptions. contrast, waterfowl-origin plasmodium haplotypes were
identical closely related lineages found avian orders. results
suggest generalist strategy plasmodium parasites infecting north
american waterfowl compared genera haemoproteus and
leucocytozoon.
