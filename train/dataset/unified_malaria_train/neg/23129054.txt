malaria deadly infectious disease many tropical subtropical
countries. previous efforts eradicate malaria failed, largely due 
emergence drug-resistant parasites, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and, in
particular, lack drugs vaccines block parasite transmission.
atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters known play role drug
transport, metabolism, resistance many organisms, including malaria
parasites. investigate whether plasmodium falciparum abc transporter
(pf14_0244 pfabcg2) modulates parasite susceptibility chemical compounds or
plays role drug resistance, disrupted gene encoding pfabcg2, screened
the recombinant wild-type 3d7 parasites library containing
2,816 drugs approved human animal use, identified antihistamine
(ketotifen) became less active pfabcg2-disrupted parasite in
culture. addition activity asexual stages gametocytes,
ketotifen highly potent blocking oocyst development p. falciparum and
the rodent parasite plasmodium yoelii mosquitoes. tests structurally
related tricyclic compounds identified additional compounds similar
activities inhibiting transmission. additionally, ketotifen appeared have
some activity relapse plasmodium cynomolgi infection rhesus
monkeys. clinical evaluation ketotifen related compounds,
including synthetic new derivatives, blocking malaria transmission may provide
new weapons current effort malaria eradication.
