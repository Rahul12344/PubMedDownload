we recently identified novel plasmodium berghei (pb) liver stage (ls) genes 
as dna vaccines significantly reduce pb ls parasite burden (lpb) c57bl/6 (b6) 
mice mechanism mediated, part, cd8 cells. study, we
sought determine fine antigen (ag) specificities cd8 cells target ls
malaria parasites. guided algorithms predicting mhc class i-restricted
epitopes, ranked sequences 32 pb ls ags selected ~400 peptides
restricted mouse h-2kb h-2db alleles analysis high-throughput
method caged mhc class i-tetramer technology. identified 9-mer h-2kb
restricted cd8 cell epitope, kb-17, specifically recognized activated
cd8 cell responses b6 mice immunized pb radiation-attenuated
sporozoites (ras) challenged infectious sporozoites (spz). kb-17
peptide derived recently described novel protective pb ls ag,
pbanka_1031000 (mif4g-like protein). notably, immunization kb-17 epitope
delivered form minigene adenovirus serotype 5 vector reduced
lpb mice infected spz. basis results, kb-17 peptide was
available cd8 cell activation recall following immunization pb ras
and challenge infectious spz. identification novel mhc class
i-restricted epitope protective pb ls ag, mif4g-like protein, crucial
for advancing understanding immune responses plasmodium by
extension, toward vaccine development malaria.
