apicomplexan parasites complex life cycles, frequently split between
different hosts reliant rapid responses parasites react changing
environmental conditions. calcium ion (ca(2+)) signaling consequently
essential cellular developmental changes support apicomplexan
parasitism. apicomplexan genomes reveal rich repertoire genes involved in
calcium signaling, although many genes responsible observed
physiological changes remain unknown. evidence, example, the
presence nifedipine-sensitive calcium entry mechanism toxoplasma, the
molecular components involved ca(2+) entry toxoplasma plasmodium, 
have identified. major calcium stores endoplasmic reticulum 
(er), acidocalcisomes, plant-like vacuole toxoplasma, food 
vacuole plasmodium spp. pharmacological evidence suggests ca(2+) release 
from intracellular stores may mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3)
or cyclic adp ribose (cadpr) although molecular evidence the
presence receptors second messengers parasites. several
ca(2+)-atpases present apicomplexans putative mitochondrial
ca(2+)/h(+) exchanger identified. apicomplexan genomes contain numerous 
genes encoding ca(2+)-binding proteins, notable expansion of
calcium-dependent protein kinases (cdpks), whose study revealed roles in
gliding motility, microneme secretion, host cell invasion egress, and
parasite differentiation. microneme secretion also shown depend on
the c2 domain containing protein doc2 plasmodium spp. toxoplasma,
providing evidence complex transduction ca(2+) signals in
these organisms. characterization pathways could lead the
discovery novel drug targets better understanding role of
ca(2+) parasites.
