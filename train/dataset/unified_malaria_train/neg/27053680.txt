myzozoans (which include dinoflagellates, chromerids apicomplexans) display
notable divergence ciliate sister group, including reduced
mitochondrial genome divergent metabolic processes. factors contributing 
to divergent processes still poorly understood could serve as
potential drug targets disease-causing protists. here, report the
identification characterization small mitochondrial protein the
rodent-infecting apicomplexan parasite plasmodium berghei essential for
development mosquito host. parasites lacking gene mitochondrial
protein ookinete developmental defect (mpodd) showed malformed parasites that
were unable transmit mosquitoes. knockout parasites displayed reduced
mitochondrial mass without affecting organelle integrity, indicating role of
the protein mitochondrial biogenesis morphology maintenance likely
role mitochondrial import metabolism. using genetic complementation
experiments, identified previously unrecognized plasmodium falciparum
homologue rescue mpodd(-) phenotype, thereby showing gene
is functionally conserved. far detected, mpodd found in
myzozoans, homologues phylum apicomplexa appears arisen in
free-living dinoflagellates. suggests mpodd protein conserved
mitochondrial role important myzozoans. previous studies
identified number essential proteins generally highly conserved
evolutionarily, study identifies, first time, non-canonical protein
fulfilling crucial function mitochondrion parasite transmission.
