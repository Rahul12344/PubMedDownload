background: anopheles sinensis one major malaria vectors. however,
pyrethroid resistance an. sinensis threatening malaria control. cytochrome 
p450-mediated detoxification important pyrethroid resistance mechanism that
has unexplored an. sinensis. study, performed comprehensive 
analysis an. sinensis p450 gene superfamily special attention to
their role pyrethroid resistance using bioinformatics molecular
approaches.
results: data revealed presence 112 individual p450 genes an.
sinensis, classified four major clans (mitochondrial, cyp2, cyp3 
and cyp4), 18 families 50 subfamilies. sixty-seven genes formed nine gene
clusters, genes within cluster gene family a
similar gene structure. phylogenetic analysis showed an. sinensis
p450s (82/112) close 1: 1 orthology anopheles gambiae p450s. five
genes (ascyp6z2, ascyp6p3v1, ascyp6p3v2, ascyp9j5 ascyp306a1) were
significantly upregulated three pyrethroid-resistant populations both
rna-seq rt-qpcr analyses, suggesting could important
p450 genes involved pyrethroid resistance an. sinensis.
conclusion: study provides insight diversity an. sinensis p450
superfamily basis elucidating pyrethroid resistance mechanism
