plasmodium lccl proteins comprise family six proteins function a
protein complex essential roles sporozoite transmission. in
plasmodium berghei, family members pblap1, pblap2 pblap3 shown to
be expressed gametocytes and, following gametogenesis fertilization, be
targeted distinctive multivesicular organelles termed crystalloids form
in ookinete. here, show gfp-tagging pblap4, pblap5 pblap6,
like family members, associated crystalloids. however, in
contrast family members, protein expression pblap4, pblap5 pblap6
was detected gametocytes, even though transcription corresponding
genes prominent sexual blood stage parasites. results
suggest translational repression controls expression lccl protein
repertoire and, consequently, temporal function protein complex during
p. berghei development mosquito.
