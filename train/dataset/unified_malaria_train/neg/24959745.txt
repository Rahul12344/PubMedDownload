mosquitoes important disease vectors transmit wide variety of
pathogens humans, including cause malaria dengue fever.
insecticides traditionally deployed control populations of
disease-causing mosquitoes, emergence insecticide resistance has
severely limited number active compounds used mosquitoes.
thus, improve control resistant mosquitoes need identify 
new insecticide targets active compounds insecticide development.
recently demonstrated inward rectifier potassium (kir) channels small
molecule inhibitors kir channels offer promising new molecular targets and
active compounds, respectively, insecticide development. provide
pharmacological validation specific mosquito kir channel (aekir1) the
yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti. show vu590, small-molecule
inhibitor mammalian kir1.1 kir7.1 channels, potently inhibits aekir1 but
not another mosquito kir channel (aekir2b) vitro. moreover, show a
previously identified inhibitor aekir1 (vu573) elicits unexpected agonistic
effect aekir2b vitro. injection vu590 hemolymph adult female
mosquitoes significantly inhibits capacity excrete urine kills 
within 24 h, suggesting mechanism action excretory system.
importantly, structurally-related vu590 analog (vu608), weakly blocks
aekir1 vitro, significant effects excretory capacity 
not kill mosquitoes. observations suggest toxic effects vu590
are associated inhibition aekir1.
