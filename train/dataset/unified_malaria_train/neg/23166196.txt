the impact malaria intervention measures (insecticide-treated net use and
artemisinin combination therapy) malaria genetics investigated two
sites western kenya: endemic lowland epidemic highland. genetic 
structure parasite population assessed using microsatellites, and
the prevalence drug-resistant mutations examined using polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. two years after
intervention, genetic diversity remained high populations. significant 
decrease prevalence quintuple mutations conferring resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine detected populations, mutation
prevalence codon 1246 plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene
had increased highland population. decrease in
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant mutants encouraging, increase in
p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene mutations worrisome these
mutations linked resistance antimalarial drugs. addition, 
high level genetic diversity observed intervention suggests transmission
is still high population.
