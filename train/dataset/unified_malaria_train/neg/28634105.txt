plasmodium knowlesi, malaria parasite macaques, emerged important 
parasite humans. despite significance p. knowlesi malaria parts of
southeast asia, little known genetic variation this
parasite. aim explore sequence variation molecule called the
42kda merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1), found surface blood
stages plasmodium spp. plays key role erythrocyte invasion. several
studies p. falciparum reported c-terminus (a 42kda fragment) 
merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-142; consisting msp-119 msp-133) a
potential candidate malaria vaccine. however, date, study yet
investigated sequence diversity gene encoding p. knowlesi msp-142
(comprising pk-msp-119 pk-msp-133) among isolates malaysia. present
study explored aspect. twelve p. knowlesi isolates collected from
patients hospitals selangor sabah borneo, malaysia, 2012 
2014. pk-msp-142 gene amplified pcr directly sequenced. haplotype 
diversity (hd) nucleotide diversity (л) studied among isolates.
there relatively high genetic variation among p. knowlesi isolates; overall
hd л 1±0.034 0.01132±0.00124, respectively. total nine
different haplotypes related amino acid alterations 13 positions, the
pk-msp-119 sequence found conserved pk-msp-133. found
evidence negative selection pk-msp-42 well 33kda 19kda
fragments comparing rate non-synonymous versus synonymous
substitutions. future investigations study large numbers samples from
disparate geographical locations critically assess whether molecule might
be potential vaccine target p. knowlesi.
