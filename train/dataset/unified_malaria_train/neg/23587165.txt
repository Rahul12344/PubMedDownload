background: china implementing national malaria elimination programme. a
high proportion clinically diagnosed malaria cases reported some
provinces china. order understand exact situation make clear the
nature patients, much importance make case verifications,
particularly pathogenic perspective.
methods: guizhou province targeted high proportion of
clinically diagnosed malaria cases. random selection around 10% of
malaria cases 1 may 2011 30 april 2012, reported national
web-based case reporting system province, field verifications made
on 14-17 may 2012 follows. firstly, reported information case 
rechecked onsite case registrations investigation forms, an
in-depth interview conducted patient. secondly, patient's blood
smears kept local cdc cross-checked microscopically national
experienced microscopist. thirdly, two kinds polymerase chain reaction (pcrs).
including tag-primer nested/multiplex pcr (ut-pcr) based cytochrome oxidase
gene (cox i) nested pcr based 18s rrna gene performed simultaneously 
using local cdc kept filter paper dry blood samples identify plasmodium
spp.
results: twelve 152 malaria cases selected, including nine clinically
diagnosed malaria cases, two confirmed falciparum malaria cases one confirmed
vivax malaria case. original case documents site completely in
conformity reported data, patients recalled malaria 
symptoms cured consuming corresponding anti-malarial
drugs. moreover, re-examination results microscopy pcr exactly in
agreement original tests.
discussion: inconsistent results found reported case
information present study reasons clinically diagnosed
patients remains unclear. uniform standardized sample collection and
processing trained among clinicians, sensitive specific
techniques explored used malaria diagnosis. study is
needed order observationally focussed rather retrospective.
