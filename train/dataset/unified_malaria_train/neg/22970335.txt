background: estimated 2.85 billion people live risk plasmodium vivax
transmission. endemic countries vivax malaria causes significant morbidity and
its mortality becoming widely appreciated, drug-resistant strains are
increasing prevalence, increasing number reports indicate p.
vivax capable breaking duffy-negative barrier long considered
to confer resistance blood stage infection. absence robust vitro
propagation limits understanding fundamental aspects parasite's
biology, including determinants dormant hypnozoite phase, its
virulence drug susceptibility, molecular mechanisms underlying red
blood cell invasion.
methodology/principal findings: here, report results whole genome
sequencing five p. vivax isolates obtained malagasy cambodian
patients, monkey-adapted belem strain. obtained average 70-400 x
coverage genome, resulting 93% sal reference
sequence covered 20 reads more. study identifies 80,000 snps 
distributed throughout genome allow designing association studies 
and population surveys. analysis genome-wide genetic diversity p. vivax
also reveals considerable allele sharing among isolates different
continents. observation could consistent high level gene flow
among parasite strains distributed throughout world.
conclusions: study shows feasible perform whole genome
sequencing p. vivax field isolates rigorously characterize genetic
diversity parasite. catalogue polymorphisms generated will
enable large-scale genotyping studies contribute better understanding of
p. vivax traits drug resistance erythrocyte invasion, partially
circumventing lack laboratory culture hampered vivax research for
years.
