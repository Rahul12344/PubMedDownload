background: malaria causing half million deaths 214 million
clinical cases annually. despite tremendous efforts control malaria,
the global morbidity mortality significantly changed the
last 50Â years. artemisinin, extracted medicinal plant artemisia sp. is
an effective anti-malarial drug. 2015, elucidation effectiveness of
artemisinin potent anti-malarial drug acknowledged nobel prize.
owing tight market low yield artemisinin, economical way to
increase production increase content artemisia sp. through
different biotechnological approaches including genetic transformation.
methods: artemisia annua artemisia dubia transformed rol abc genes 
through agrobacterium tumefacienes agrobacterium rhizogenes methods. the
artemisinin content analysed compared transformed and
untransformed plants help lc-ms/ms. expression key genes
[cytochrome p450 (cyp71av1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (aldh1), amorpha-4, 11
diene synthase (ads)] biosynthetic pathway artemisinin gene for
trichome development sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic (tfar1) measured using
quantitative real time pcr (qrt-pcr). trichome density analysed using
confocal microscope.
results: artemisinin content significantly increased transformed material 
of artemisia species compared un-transformed plants. artemisinin
content within leaves transformed lines increased factor nine,
indicating plant capable synthesizing much higher amounts has
been achieved far traditional breeding. expression artemisinin 
biosynthesis genes significantly increased, although variation the
genes observed. cyp71av1 aldh1 expression levels higher of
ads. levels tfar1 expression also increased transgenic lines. 
trichome density also significantly increased leaves transformed
plants, trichomes found control roots transformed roots. the
detection significantly raised levels expression genes involved in
artemisinin biosynthesis transformed roots correlated production of
significant amounts artemisinin tissues. suggests synthesis
is occurring tissues trichomes, contradicts previous
theories.
conclusion: transformation artemisia sp. rol abc genes lead the
increased production artemisinin, help meet increasing
demand artemisinin diverse pharmacological anti-malarial
importance.
