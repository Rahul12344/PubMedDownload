aims: endothelial cell (ec) tube formation crucial tumor angiogenesis,
which becomes target chemotherapy. anti-malaria agent
dihydroartemisinin (dha) inhibited tumor growth angiogenesis. aim this
study investigate effects dha ec tube formation the
underlying mechanisms.
materials methods: human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) were
cultured different concentrations dha, tube formation was
measured vitro angiogenesis assay. protein levels signal transducer 
and activator transcription factor 3 (stat3), phosphorylated stat3 fatty
acid synthase (fasn) detected western blotting. gene expression of
fasn determined real time-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). fasn
sirna stat3 (y705d) vector introduced huvecs lipofectin
transfection.
key findings: dha treatment inhibited tube formation, phosphorylation 
stat3 y705 huvecs. expression fasn down-regulated dha and
stat3 inhibitor. inhibitory effect dha fasn expression huvecs was
eliminated co-treatment stat3 inhibitor. over-expression stat3
(y705d) relieved inhibitory effect dha tube-formation fasn
expression. hypoxia condition, expression fasn up-regulated but
inhibited dha treatment huvecs suppression stat3
phosphorylation.
significance: demonstrate dha inhibits protein level fasn via
attenuation y705 phosphorylation stat3, subsequently inhibits tube 
formation huvecs. results support therapeutic potential dha on
angiogenesis.
