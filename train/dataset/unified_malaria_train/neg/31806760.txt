artemisinins effective variety parasites provide first
line treatment malaria. laboratory studies identified several
mechanisms artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum, including
mutations kelch13 associated delayed clearance clinical 
isolates, although mechanisms likely involved. explore other
potential mechanisms resistance parasites, took advantage genetic
tractability toxoplasma gondii, related parasite shows moderate
sensitivity artemisinin. resistant populations t. gondii selected by
culture increasing concentrations whole-genome sequencing identified
several nonconservative point mutations emerged population were
fixed time. genome editing using crispr/cas9 used introduce point
mutations conferring amino acid changes serine protease homologous degp
and serine/threonine protein kinase unknown function. single double
mutations conferred competitive advantage wild-type parasites the
presence drug, despite changing ec50 values. additionally, evolved
resistant lines showed dramatic amplification mitochondria genome,
including genes encoding cytochrome b cytochrome c oxidase i. prior studies
in yeast mammalian tumor cells implicate mitochondrion target of
artemisinins, treatment wild-type parasites high concentrations of
drug decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, phenotype stably
altered resistant parasites. findings extend repertoire of
mutations associated artemisinin resistance suggest the
mitochondrion may important target inhibition resistance t.
