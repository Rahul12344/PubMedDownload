background: pregnant women remain increased risk malaria with
primigravidae highest risk. genetic polymorphism fc receptor 
iia immunologlobulin (ig) g (fcγriia) determines igg subclass binding.
protection pregnancy-associated malaria (pam) associated the
production igg specific apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1). present
study undertaken examine relationship specific igg/igg
subclasses malaria infection. second aim study examine the
association fcγriia r/h131 polymorphism correlation specific
anti-malarial igg antibodies ama-1 distribution asymptomatic malaria
infection among saudi women living southern part saudi arabia.
methods: one hundred twenty pregnant women living area meso-endemic 
plasmodium falciparum malaria infection consecutively enrolled onto the
study. pregnant women asymptomatic attending routine antenatal
clinics. levels plasma antibodies (igg subclasses ama-1) measured
using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). genotyping of
fcγriia-r/h131 dimorphism performed using gene-specific polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) amplification allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion
(bstu1) pcr product.
results: total sixty-two (52%) pregnant women diagnosed with
asymptomatic malarial infection (asm) compared 58 (48%) malaria free
controls (mfc). asm group, high levels anti-malarial igg1
and igg3, compared mfc (p value <0.001, respectively). fcγriia-r/r131
genotype r131 found statistically significantly prevalent 
the asm group compared mfc group [55% asm versus 12% mfc,
odds ratio (or) 5.62, 95% confidence interval (ci)= (2.03- 15.58), p value=
0.001]. however, h/h131 genotype showed statistically significant association
with mfc [14% asm versus 50% mfc, or(0.36), 95% ci= (0.14- 0.95), p
value= 0.03].
conclusions: study revealed asm patients higher anti-malarial
igg igg subclasses antibody levels compared mfc. the
fcγriia-r/r131 genotype r131 allele found statistically prevalent 
in asm compared mfc group. individuals carrying h/h131 were
consistently associated higher levels anti-malarial igg subclasses.
