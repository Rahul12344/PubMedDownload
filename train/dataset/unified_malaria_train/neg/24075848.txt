cytokine gene variants known influence infectious disease
susceptibility harm-avoidant behaviors, suggesting risk variants
may pleiotropically linked instinctual disease-avoidant traits. the
gamma-interferon (ifng) +874 t>a polymorphism (rs2430561) ideal candidate
gene variant immune-behavioral studies. functional snp, regulating
ifng mrna expression; known modulate serotonergic activity is
therefore capable modifying behavior; previously associated
with increased susceptibility malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy chagas
disease. hypothesized infectious disease-high-risk ifng +874 a-allele
would associated four personality traits previously reported as
behavioral defenses infection: harm avoidance (ha), extraversion (e),
exploratory excitability (exp e), openness experience (o). tested 
hypothesis sample 168 healthy university students southern
california genotyped ifng +874 t>a evaluated temperament and
character inventory-revised (tci-r) neo five-factor inventory (neo-ffi). 
we found infectious disease-high-risk ifng +874 a-allele associated 
with increased ha (p=0.001) decreased e (p=0.030) exp e (p=0.030). 
findings suggest ifng +874 gene variant linked infectious
disease susceptibility proactive behavioral defenses reduce infection
risk healthy subjects.
