plasmodium salivary gland sporozoites upregulate expression unique subset of
genes, collectively called uis (upregulated infectious sporozoites). many 
uis shown essential early liver stage development, although little
is known regulation. previously identified conserved
sporozoite-specific protein, sap1, essential role plasmodium
liver infection. targeted deletion sap1 plasmodium yoelii caused the
depletion number selectively tested uis transcripts sporozoites,
resulting complete early liver stage arrest. here, use global gene
expression survey comprehensively identify transcripts affected 
by sap1 deletion. find effect upon transcript abundance uis
genes, well select genes previously grouped uis. importantly, 
show lack sap1 causes specific degradation transcripts. 
collectively, data suggest sap1 involved selective
post-transcriptional mechanism regulate abundance transcripts critical 
to infectivity sporozoites. although pysap1(-) sporozoites depleted of
many important transcripts, confer long-lasting sterile protection 
against wild-type sporozoite challenge mice. sap1 therefore appealing
candidate locus attenuation plasmodium falciparum.
