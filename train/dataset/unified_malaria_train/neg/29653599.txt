background: endosymbiotic bacteria inhabit variety arthropods including
ticks may multiple effects host's survival, reproduction or
pathogen acquisition transmission. rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides one of
the widely distributed tick species china. symbiotic bacteria
composition impacts r. haemaphysaloides ticks studied.
the present study investigated composition microbial community r.
haemaphysaloides ticks assessed effects endosymbionts the
host's fecundity antibiotic treatment experiments.
methods: microbial population female male r. haemaphysaloides ticks
was analyzed using illumina miseq sequencing 16s rrna gene. thirty engorged
female ticks randomly divided five groups injected with
ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, tetracycline, phosphate-buffered
solution (pbs), respectively. effects antibiotic treatments maternal
oviposition, egg hatching density endosymbionts evaluated.
results: illumina miseq sequencing showed coxiella rickettsia the
predominant bacterial genera inhabiting r. haemaphysaloides ticks. antibiotic
treatment experiments found kanamycin reduced density coxiella-like
endosymbiont (coxiella-le hereafter) eggs, ciprofloxacin reduced density
of rickettsia-like endosymbiont (rickettsia-le), tetracycline effect on
both endosymbionts, ampicillin affected neither. meanwhile hatching rates
of eggs observed decrease greatly kanamycin or
tetracycline-treated group maintained ampicillin or
ciprofloxacin-treated group. furthermore, reduced hatching rates found
to associated density coxiella-le eggs.
conclusions: findings indicate coxiella-le essential the
reproduction r. haemaphysaloides ticks, kanamycin used to
study role coxiella-le ticks.
