peptide-based drug discovery experienced significant upturn within past
decade since introduction chemical modifications unnatural amino acids
has allowed overcoming drawbacks associated peptide
therapeutics. strengthened features, modified peptides become capable 
occupying niche emerges two major classes today's
therapeutics-small molecules (<500 da) biologics (>5000 da). stabilized
α-helices proven particularly successful impairing disease-relevant ppis 
previously considered "undruggable." among those, hydrocarbon stapled α-helical
peptides emerged novel class potential peptide therapeutics. this
review provides comprehensive overview development applications of
hydrocarbon stapled peptides discussing benefits limitations this
technique.
