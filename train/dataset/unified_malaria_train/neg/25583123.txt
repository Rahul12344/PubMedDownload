objective: artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (as + sp) somalia's
national treatment policy since 2006. routine monitoring first-line malaria
treatment needed ensure appropriate national malaria treatment policy and
early detection drug resistance. purpose, conducted therapeutic
efficacy studies as + sp treatment uncomplicated malaria somalia
in 2011.
methods: studies conducted three sentinel sites. eligible patients were
evaluated clinical parasitological outcomes according standard
protocol. molecular surveillance conducted resistance conferring mutations
in p.falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dfhr) dihydropteroate synthase
(dhps) genes.
results: proportion pcr-corrected treatment failures high jamame
(22%, 95% ci: 13.7-32.8%) low (<5%) janale jowhar. patients
cleared parasites day 3. molecular markers associated sp resistance 
detected three sites. treatment failure associated presence
of double mutant dhps a437g/k540e (or = 22.4, 95% ci: 5.1-98.1), quadruple
mutant dhfr n51i/s108n+dhps a437g/k540e (or = 5.5, 95% ci: 2.3-13.6), quintuple
mutant dhfr n51i/c59r/s108n+dhps a437g/k540e (or = 3.5, 95% ci: 1.4-8.8) and
younger age (or=0.86, 95% ci: 0.76-0.96).
conclusions: high treatment failure rate observed jamame, together with
the presence molecular mutations associated sp resistance, indicates
p. falciparum resistance sp. jowhar, high treatment failure rates were
absent despite presence molecular mutations; signs resistance vivo
may masked stronger immunity older study population. 
study underscores need update somalia's national malaria treatment policy.
