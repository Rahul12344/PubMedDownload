transmission blocking vaccines (tbvs) target antigens midgut
epithelium anopheles mosquitoes among promising tools the
elimination malaria parasite. characterization analysis effective
antigens first step design tbvs. calreticulin (crt), lectin-like
protein, anopheles albimanus midgut, shown antigenic features,
suggesting promising novel tbv target. crt highly conserved protein
with similar features vertebrates invertebrates including anopheline. we
cloned full-length crt gene malaria vector, anopheles stephensi (ascrt) 
and explored interaction recombinant ascrt protein, expressed a
prokaryotic system (pgex-6p-1), surface proteins plasmodium berghei
ookinetes immunofluorescence assay. cellular localization ascrt was
determined using baculovirus expression system. sequence analysis the
whole cdna ascrt revealed ascrt contains orf 1221 bp. amino
acid sequence ascrt protein obtained study showed 64% homology with
similar protein human. ascrt shares common features crts 
other species. gene encodes 406 amino-acid protein molecular mass
of 46 kda, contains predicted 16 amino-acid signal peptides, conserved
cysteine residues, proline-rich region, highly acidic c-terminal domain
with endoplasmic reticulum retrieval sequence hdel. production gst-ascrt
recombinant protein confirmed western blot analysis using antibody
against gst protein. fitc-labeled gst-ascrt exhibited significant
interaction p. berghei ookinete surface proteins. purified recombinant
gst-ascrt, labeled fitc, displayed specific binding surface p.
berghei ookinetes comparison control. moreover, expression ascrt
in baculovirus expression system indicated ascrt localized the
surface sf9 cells. results suggest ascrt could utilized a
potential target future studies tbv area malaria control.
