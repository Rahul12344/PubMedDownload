in suriname, artesunate monotherapy therapeutic efficacy trial recently
conducted evaluate partial artemisinin resistance emerging plasmodium
falciparum genotyped pfk13 propeller domain p. falciparum 40 samples
as well mutations proposed associated artemisinin-resistant
mutants. find mutations previously associated artemisinin
resistance southeast asia, found fixed resistance mutations for
chloroquine (cq) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. additionally, pfcrt c350r
mutation, associated reversal cq resistance piperaquine-selective
pressure, present 62% samples. results neutral
microsatellite data also confirmed high parasite gene flow guiana
shield. although recruiting participants therapeutic efficacy studies is
challenging areas malaria endemicity low due low number
of malaria cases reported, conducting studies along molecular
surveillance remains essential monitoring artemisinin-resistant
alleles characterization population structure p. falciparum
in areas targeted malaria elimination.
