the early transcribed membrane proteins etramps belong family small,
transmembrane molecules unique plasmodium parasite, share signal
peptide followed short lysine-rich stretch, transmembrane domain a
variable, highly charged c-terminal region. etramps usually expressed a
stage-specific manner. blood stages localize parasitophorous
vacuole membrane and, described cases, vesicle-like structures exported 
the host erythrocyte cytosol. two family members rodent parasite
plasmodium berghei, uis3 uis4, localize secretory organelles of
sporozoites parasitophorous membrane vacuole liver stages. by
the use specific antibodies generation transgenic lines, showed 
that p. berghei etramp family member sep2 abundantly expressed in
gametocytes well mosquito liver stages. intracellular parasite
stages, sep2 routed parasitophorous vacuole membrane while, invasive
ookinete sporozoite stages, localizes parasite surface. date
sep2 etramp protein detected throughout parasite life cycle.
furthermore, sep2 also released gliding motility salivary gland
sporozoites. limited number proteins known involved key
function best characterized, csp trap, promising
transmission-blocking candidates. results suggest etramp members may 
viewed new potential candidates malaria control.
