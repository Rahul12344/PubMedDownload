background: sand flies vectors leishmania parasites. develop the
sand fly midgut, leishmania multiplies undergoes various stage
differentiations giving rise infective form, metacyclic promastigotes.
to determine changes sand fly midgut gene expression caused the
presence leishmania, performed rna-seq uninfected leishmania
infantum-infected lutzomyia longipalpis midguts seven different libraries
corresponding time points cover various leishmania developmental
stages.
results: combined transcriptomes resulted de novo assembly 13,841
sand fly midgut transcripts. importantly, 113 sand fly transcripts, about
1%, differentially expressed presence leishmania parasites.
further, observed distinct differentially expressed sand fly midgut
transcripts corresponding presence various leishmania
stages suggesting parasite stage influences midgut gene expression a
specific manner. two main patterns sand fly gene expression modulation were
noted. early time points (days 1-4), transcripts down-regulated by
leishmania infection large fold changes (> 32 fold). among down-regulated 
genes, transcription factor forkhead/hnf-3 hormone degradation enzymes
were differentially regulated day 2 appear upstream regulators
of nutrient transport, digestive enzymes, peritrophic matrix proteins.
conversely, later time points (days 6 onwards), differentially
expressed transcripts up-regulated leishmania infection small fold
changes (< 32 fold). molecular functions genes associated 
with metabolism lipids detoxification xenobiotics.
conclusion: overall, data suggest presence leishmania produces 
limited change midgut transcript expression profile sand flies.
further, leishmania modulates sand fly gene expression early the
developmental cycle order overcome barriers imposed midgut, yet 
it behaves like commensal later time points massive number of
parasites anterior midgut results modest changes midgut gene
expression.
