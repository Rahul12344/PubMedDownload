we examined seasonal prevalence avian haemosporidians (plasmodium and
haemoproteus) migrant resident birds western himalaya, india. we
investigated infection haemosporidians avian hosts associated with
temporal changes temperature mosquito abundance along host abundance 
and life-history traits (body mass). using molecular methods parasite
detection sequencing partial cytochrome b gene, 12 plasmodium 27
haemoproteus lineages isolated. 1-year study december 2008 to
december 2009 tropical himalayan foothills revealed lack seasonal
variation plasmodium spp. prevalence birds despite strong correlation
between mosquito abundance temperature. probability infection with
plasmodium decreased increase temperature. total parasite prevalence 
specifically plasmodium prevalence showed increase average avian body
mass. addition, total prevalence exhibited u-shaped relationship avian 
host abundance. difference prevalence plasmodium spp. or
haemoproteus spp. across altitudes; parasite prevalence high-altitude
locations mainly driven seasonal migrants. one haemoproteus lineage
showed cross-species infections migrant resident birds. the
first molecular study tropical himalayan bird community emphasizes
the importance studying seasonal variation parasite prevalence. study
provides basis evolutionary study epidemiology avian
malaria spread disease across himalayan bird communities, may not
have exposed vectors parasites throughout year, with
consequential implications risk infection na√Øve resident birds in
high altitude.
