background & objectives: many host genetic factors associated the
disease severity fatal outcome falciparum malaria. cd40l gene been
found one important factors associated malaria african 
countries. study aimed investigate possible association cd40l 
gene polymorphism severe falciparum malaria indian adults.
methods: one hundred fifteen adult cases severe falciparum malaria were
included study. two single- nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) cd40l gene,
cd40l-726(c/t) cd40l+220(c/t) investigated, possible association
with different clinical sub-phenotypes severe falciparum malaria were
analyzed.
results: statistically significant difference observed incidence of
cd40l-726c patients control group. incidence cd40l+220c
allele found significantly higher (or, 2.25; p = 0.03) male patients
compared controls significant difference observed females.
haplotype data showed susceptibility -726t/+220c haplotype severe
malaria whereas -726c/+220t associated protection severe
malaria. cd40l+220c allele associated severe malarial anaemia males
(Ï‡2 = 6.60; p = 0.01).
interpretation & conclusion: cd40l gene polymorphism found associated
with severe falciparum malaria indian population especially severe malarial
anaemia. cd40l may considered factor immunity understanding the
pathophysiology falciparum malaria.
