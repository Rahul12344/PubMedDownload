mosquitoes important vectors several pathogens thereby contribute to
the spread diseases, social, economic public health impacts. amongst 
the approximately 450 species anopheles, 60 recognized vectors of
human malaria, important parasitic disease. africa, anopheles gambiae
is main malaria vector mosquito. current malaria control strategies are
largely focused drugs vector control measures insecticides and
bed-nets. improvement current, development new, mosquito-targeted
malaria control methods rely better understanding mosquito vector
biology. organism's transcriptome reflection physiological state
and transcriptomic analyses different conditions relevant mosquito
vector competence therefore yield important information. transcriptomic
analyses contributed significant information processes as
blood-feeding parasite-vector interaction, insecticide resistance, tissue-
and stage-specific gene regulation, thereby facilitating path towards the
development new malaria control methods. here, discuss main
applications transcriptomic analyses an. gambiae led better 
understanding mosquito vector competence.
