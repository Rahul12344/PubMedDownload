this study aimed investigate expression sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk-1)
and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (s1pr-3) mouse model of
malaria-associated acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ali/ards). dba/2 mice infected plasmodium berghei anka generate 
experimental model malaria-associated ali/ards. infected mice divided
into 2 groups based histopathological study lung tissues: with
and without ali/ards. expression sphk-1 s1pr-3 proteins in
the lung tissues investigated using immunohistochemical staining western 
blot analysis. addition, s1p level quantified plasma lung
tissues using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results
demonstrated cellular expression sphk-1 s1pr-3 proteins was
significantly upregulated endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells and
alveolar macrophages lung tissues malaria-infected mice ali/ards
compared control groups. increased expression sphk-1
and s1pr-3 proteins confirmed using western blot analysis. concentration 
of s1p plasma lung tissues significantly decreased malaria-infected
mice ali/ards compared non-ali/ards control mice. furthermore,
increased expression sphk-1 s1pr-3 proteins significantly correlated
with lung injury scores s1p concentrations malaria-infected mice with
ali/ards. findings highlight increased expression sphk-1 s1pr-3 in
the lung tissues malaria-infected mice ali/ards.
