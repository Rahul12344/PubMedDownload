background: pneumocystis pneumonia (pcp) serious risk hiv-positive
patients. asymptomatic infection colonisation p. jirovecii shown
to occur frequently. pcr assays frequently identify cases, due high
sensitivity. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) gene copy number cut-off values
have suggested differentiate colonisation infection; need be
standardised routine use. compared results qpcr an
immunofluorescence assay (ifa) determine specific cut-off value.
methods: march 2005 june 2009, induced sputum specimens were
collected adult patients clinically suspected pcp, the
chris hani baragwanath hospital gauteng, south africa. laboratory diagnosis of
pcp done conventional direct ifa qpcr assay. receiver operating 
characteristic (roc) analysis performed determine suitable copy number
cut-off value.
results: p. jirovecii identified 51% (156/305) 67% (204/305) of
specimens using ifa qpcr, respectively. cut-off value qpcr that
best predicted ifa results 78 copies/5 Î¼l (area roc curve 0.92).
the sensitivity specificity qpcr using cut-off 94.6% 89.1%,
respectively, compared ifa.
discussion: results roc curve analysis indicate excellent
predictive value qpcr using proposed cut-off. however, ifa test is
an imperfect gold standard cut-off used isolation;
clinical data also contribute interpretation qpcr result.
