toxoplasma gondii intracellular parasite causes disseminated
infections produce neurological damage fetuses immunocompromised 
individuals. microneme protein 2 (mic2), member thrombospondin-related
anonymous protein (trap) family, secreted protein important t. gondii
motility, host cell attachment, invasion, egress. mic2 contains six
thrombospondin type repeats (tsrs) modified c-mannose o-fucose 
in plasmodium spp. mammals. here, using ms analysis, found four
tsrs t. gondii mic2 protein o-fucosyltransferase 2 (pofut2) acceptor
sites modified dhexhex disaccharide, whereas trp residues within three
tsrs also modified c-mannose. disruption genes encoding either pofut2
or putative gdp-fucose transporter (nst2) resulted loss mic2
o-fucosylation, detected antibody glcfuc disaccharide, and
in markedly reduced cellular levels mic2. furthermore, 10-15% the
δpofut2 δnst2 vacuoles, mic2 accumulated earlier secretory pathway
rather localizing micronemes. dissemination tachyzoites human
foreskin fibroblasts reduced knockouts, exhibited
defects attachment invasion host cells comparable δmic2
phenotype. results, indicating o-fucosylation tsrs required 
efficient processing mic2 normal parasite invasion, consistent
with recent demonstration plasmodium falciparum δpofut2 strain has
decreased virulence also support conserved role glycosylation
pathway quality control tsr-containing proteins eukaryotes.
