the study explored role differential rantes concentrations, receptor
ccr5 expression resulting immunomodulation pathogenesis and/or
recovery falciparum malaria. study population included cases of
uncomplicated malaria (uc-m, n=128, enrolled follow-up basis), severe malaria 
(sm, n=25), healthy controls (n=112). serum rantes tnf-α levels were
evaluated elisa. monocyte levels activation profile studied flow
cytometry. differential mrna expression profile studied real-time pcr.
blood parasite count evaluated registered pathologists. rantes
concentration significantly downregulated sm cases compared uc-m
(p=.046) controls (p<.001). expression monocyte marker mcd14, activation
markers ccr5 cd40, downstream effector cytokine tnf-α significantly
higher malaria cases compared controls, sm cases compared uc-m. tnf-α
expression correlated positively cd40 ccr5 expressions. follow-up-based 
analysis showed rantes concentrations increased recovery compared to
baseline uc-m cases (p=.106) inversely correlated malaria parasite
load, mcd14, ccr5 cd40, tnf-α expressions. findings suggest an
important association rantes concentrations plasmodium falciparum malaria
disease pathogenesis, well recovery, mediated differential
modulation regulated activation monocytes cytokine tnf-α.
