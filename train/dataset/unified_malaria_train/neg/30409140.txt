background: deltamethrin-impregnated, long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins) were
distributed study area november 2014 january 2015 evaluate
their impact malaria transmission presence insecticide-resistant
vectors. studies carried 16 selected clusters keshkal
sub-district, chhattisgarh state, india monitor characterize deltamethrin 
resistance anopheles culicifacies sensu lato.
results: deltamethrin susceptibility an. culicifacies decreased post-llin
survey compared pre-llin survey significant (p > 0.05) while,
the knockdown values showed significant increase (p < 0.05). pre-exposure to
piperonyl butoxide, triphenyl phosphate showed synergism deltamethrin
(p < 0.001). biochemical assays showed significantly (p < 0.05) elevated
monooxygenases 3 5 clusters post-llin survey-i increased 10 of
11 clusters post-llin survey-ii, esterases found significantly
elevated clusters enzymes involved conferring pyrethroid 
resistance, discounting involvement kdr (l1014l/s) gene was
heterozygous low frequency (4-5%).
conclusion: field study, tribal district india, distribution
of deltamethrin-impregnated llins showed decrease deltamethrin susceptibility 
in an. culicifacies, major vector malaria study area india.
results indicated development resistance imminent increase in
insecticide selection pressure. urgent need develop new vector
control tools, insecticide classes novel mechanisms resistance, to
avoid delay onset resistance. regular insecticide resistance monitoring
and mechanistic studies priority malaria control programmes
to suggest strategies insecticide resistance management. global
commitment eliminate malaria 2030 needs various efforts include
development combination vector control products interventions 
becoming available.
