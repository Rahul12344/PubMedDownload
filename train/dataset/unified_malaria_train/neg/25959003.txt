the preponderant clonal evolution hypothesis (pce) predicts frequent clonal 
reproduction (sex two clones) many pathogens capable sexual
recombination results strong linkage disequilibrium presence of
discrete genetic subdivisions characterized occasional gene flow. expand on
the pce predict higher rates clonal reproduction result in: (1) 
morphologically cryptic species exhibit (2) low within-species variation and
(3) recent between-species divergence. tested predictions the
caribbean lizard malaria parasite plasmodium floridense using 63 single-infection
samples lizards collected across parasite's range, sequenced them
at two mitochondrial, one apicoplast, five nuclear genes. identified 11
provisionally cryptic species within p. floridense, exhibits low
intraspecific variation recent divergence times species (some
diverged approximately 110,000 years ago). results consistent the
hypothesis clonal reproduction profoundly affect diversification of
species capable sexual recombination, suggest clonal reproduction may
have led large number unrecognized pathogen species. factors may
influence rates clonal reproduction among pathogens unclear, we
discuss prevalence virulence may relate clonal reproduction.
