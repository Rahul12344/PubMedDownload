background: malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) play key role malaria
management control. pfhrp-2 based rdt widely used rdt for
malaria diagnosis ghana. deletion pfhrp2 plasmodium falciparum parasites
affect diagnostic accuracy pfhrp-2 based rdt kits. identifying the
prevalence distribution p. falciparum parasites deleted pfhrp2 is
important malaria control.
aim: purpose study identify confirm prevalence of
pfhrp2 deletant p. falciparum parasites circulating within different regions of
ghana.
methods: dna extracted membrane spent carestartâ„¢ pfhrp-2 rdt kits
and dried filter paper blood blots using chelex-100. exon 2 pfhrp2 pfhrp3 
genes amplified polymerase chain reaction (pcr), resolved agarose gel 
electrophoresis visualized uv light.
results: microscopic analysis blood smears samples pfhrp-2 rdt 
positive revealed parasite prevalence 54/114 (47.4 %) 2/26 (7.7 %) in
accra cape coast, respectively. pcr analysis increased parasite prevalence in
the rdt positive samples 94/114 (82.5 %) 6/26 (23.1 %) accra cape
coast respectively. exon 2 pfhrp2 gene deleted 18/54 (33.3 %)
of microscopy confirmed 36.2 % (34/94) pcr confirmed rdt positive 
samples collected accra. rdt sample, confirmed contain parasites by
either pcr microscopy negative pfhrp2 exon 2 pcr cape coast. a
survey additional 558 dbs revealed 22.4 % (46/205) 40 % (44/110)
of pcr positive samples accra cape coast, respectively, lacked exon 2 
region pfhrp2 possibly entire pfhrp2 gene.
conclusions: high number p. falciparum parasites, lack pfhrp2 exon 2
gene identified two communities ghana. continuous nationwide
monitoring prevalence pfhrp2 deletant parasites would essential to
malaria control. use rdt kits effective malaria diagnosis
despite deletion pfhrp2, pfhrp-2/pfldh combo rdt kit could enhance
the diagnosis clinical malaria ghana.
