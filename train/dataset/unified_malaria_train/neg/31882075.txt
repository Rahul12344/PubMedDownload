donkey milk attracting increasing attention nutritional milk source
similar human milk. study, carried qualitative quantitative
analysis donkey whey proteome using label-free proteomic approach,
combined parallel reaction monitoring (prm) validation method. total 
of 300 whey proteins identified donkey colostrum (dc) donkey mature
(dm) milk, 18 differentially expressed (p < 0.05) two
types milk. gene ontology (go) analysis showed differentially and
uniquely expressed proteins mainly involved cellular processes, response 
to stimulus, metabolic processes, biological regulation. molecular
functions included binding, catalytic activity, molecular functional
regulation, main annotated areas origin cell, cell-part,
and extracellular region. differentially uniquely expressed proteins
were linked malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, antigen processing and
presentation. results provide insight complexity donkey whey 
proteome molecular evidence nutritional differences different
lactation stages.
