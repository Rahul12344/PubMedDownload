plasmodium falciparum malaria major global health problem being

investigate fine-scale patterns malaria transmission, compared
repertoires rapidly evolving var genes highly endemic area. total of
3680 high-quality dblα-sequences obtained 68 p. falciparum isolates
from ten villages spread two distinct catchment areas north coast 
papua new guinea (png). modelling extent var gene diversity two 
parasite populations predicts twice many var gene alleles
circulating within catchment (mugil = 906; wosera = 1094) previously
recognized png (amele = 369). addition, limited levels var
gene sharing populations, consistent local parasite population
structure. phylogeographic analyses demonstrate neutrally evolving
microsatellite markers identified population structure catchment
