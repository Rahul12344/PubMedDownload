background: antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum involves switching among
multicopy var gene family responsible immune evasion the
maintenance chronic infections. current understanding var gene expression
and switching patterns comes experiments conducted long
laboratory-adapted strains, little known wild counterparts.
methods: genome sequencing used obtain 50 var genes parasite
isolated china-myanmar border. four clones different dominant var
genes cultured vitro replicates 50 generations. transcription of
the individual var gene detected real-time pcr switching
process analysed.
results: expression multicopy var genes mutually exclusive clones of
a wild p. falciparum isolate. activation distinct primary dominant var
genes leads different favoured switching patterns four clones. 
on/off rates individual var genes variable choice subsequent
dominant var genes random, results different switching patterns 
among replicates clonal wild p. falciparum isolate near identical
initial transcription profiles.
conclusions: study suggests switching patterns var genes are
abundant, consist conserved random parts.
