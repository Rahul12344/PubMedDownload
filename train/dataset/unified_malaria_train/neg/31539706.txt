plasmodium falciparum p. vivax co-exist different endemicity levels across
ethiopia. two decades artemether-lumefantrine (al) first line
treatment uncomplicated p. falciparum, chloroquine (cq) still used
to treat p. vivax. currently unclear whether shift cq al p.
falciparum treatment implications al efficacy results reversal
of mutations genes associated cq resistance, given high co-endemicity
of two species continued availability cq treatment p.

falciparum endemicity used. proportion plasmodium infections that
