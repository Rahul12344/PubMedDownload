background: malaria prevalent communicable disease ethiopia, 
75% country's landmass classified endemic malaria. accurate
information distribution clinical prevalence plasmodium vivax and
plasmodium falciparum malaria endemic areas, well duffy-negative
populations, essential develop integrated control strategies.
methods: total 390 416 community clinical samples, respectively,
representing different localities age groups across ethiopia examined.
malaria prevalence estimated using nested pcr 18s rrna region.
parasite gene copy number measured quantitative real-time pcr compared
between symptomatic asymptomatic samples, well between
children/adolescents adults local community. approximately 500-bp
segment human darc gene amplified sequenced identify duffy
genotype -33rd nucleotide position clinical community
samples.
results: plasmodium vivax prevalence higher south p. falciparum 
was higher north. prevalence p. vivax p. falciparum malaria 
the highest children compared adolescents adults. four p. vivax
infections detected among duffy-negative samples. samples from
asymptomatic individuals show significantly lower parasite gene copy number
than symptomatic infections p. vivax p. falciparum.
conclusions: geographical age differences influence distribution p.
vivax p. falciparum malaria ethiopia. findings offer evidence-based 
guidelines targeting malaria control efforts country.
