over past decade important advances made field innate
immunity; however, appreciation signaling pathways molecules 
participate host immune responses parasitic nematode infections lags behind
that responses microbial challenges. examined regulation
and immune activity transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) signaling the
model host drosophila melanogaster upon infection nematode parasites
heterorhabditis gerrardi h. bacteriophora containing mutualistic
bacteria photorhabdus. found genes encoding activin bone
morphogenic protein (bmp) ligands dawdle (daw) decapentaplegic (dpp) are
transcriptionally induced flies responding infection nematode
parasites, containing lacking associated bacteria. also show that
deficient daw dpp regulates survival d. melanogaster adults the
pathogens, whereas inactivation daw reduces persistence nematodes
in mutant flies. findings demonstrate novel role tgf-β
signaling pathways host anti-nematode immune response. understanding the
molecular mechanisms host anti-nematode processes potentially lead the
development novel means efficient control parasitic nematodes.
