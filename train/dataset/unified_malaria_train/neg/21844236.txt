malaria remains devastating disease despite efforts control prevention. 
extensive studies using mostly rodent infection models reveal successful
plasmodium parasite transmission african mosquito vector anopheles gambiae
depends finely tuned vector-parasite interactions. investigate the
transcriptional response a. gambiae geographically related plasmodium
falciparum populations various infection intensities different infection
stages. responses compared mosquitoes infected the
rodent parasite plasmodium berghei. demonstrate mosquito responses are
largely dependent intensity infection. major transcriptional
suppression genes involved regulation midgut homeostasis detected
in low-intensity p. falciparum infections, common type infection in
africa. importantly, genes transcriptionally induced infections tend
to phylogenetically unique a. gambiae. data suggest coadaptation
between vectors parasites may act minimize impact infection on
mosquito fitness selectively suppressing specific functional classes genes.
rna interference (rnai)-mediated gene silencing provides initial evidence for
important roles mosquito g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) in
controlling infection intensity-dependent antiparasitic responses.
