babesiosis emerging zoonosis important public health implications, 
the incidence disease risen dramatically past decade. because
the current gold standard detection babesia microscopic examination 
blood smears, accurate identification requires trained personnel. species 
genus cannot distinguished microscopically, babesia also confused
with early trophozoite stage (ring forms) plasmodium parasites. allow
more accurate diagnosis format accessible wider variety of
laboratories, developed real-time pcr assay targeting 18s rrna gene of
babesia microti, dominant babesiosis pathogen united states. the
real-time pcr performed dna extracted whole-blood specimens and
detects babesia microti limit detection ∼100 gene copies 5 μl 
blood. real-time pcr assay shown 100% specific tested 
a panel 24 organisms consisting babesia microti, babesia species,
plasmodium species, tick-borne pathogenic bacteria, other
blood-borne parasites. results using clinical specimens show assay
can detect infections lower parasitemia detected microscopic
examination. method therefore rapid, sensitive, accurate method for
detection babesia microti patient specimens.
