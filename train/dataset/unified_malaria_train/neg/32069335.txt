malaria parasites activate broad-selectivity ion channel host
erythrocyte membrane obtain essential nutrients bloodstream. this
conserved channel, known plasmodial surface anion channel (psac), been
linked parasite clag3 genes p. falciparum, epigenetic switching between
the two copies gene hinders clear understanding encoded
protein determines psac activity. here, used linkage analysis p.
falciparum cross one parent carries single clag3 gene overcome the
effects switching confirm primary role clag3 product high
confidence. despite mendelian inheritance, clag3 conditional knockdown revealed
remarkably preserved nutrient solute uptake. even surprisingly,
transport remained sensitive clag3 isoform-specific inhibitor despite
quantitative knockdown, indicating low doses clag3 transgene are
sufficient confer block. produced complete clag3 knockout line and
found exhibits incomplete loss transport activity, contrast rhoph2
and rhoph3, two psac-associated genes cannot disrupted nutrient
uptake abolished absence. although clag3 knockout incur a
fitness cost standard nutrient-rich culture conditions, parasite could
not propagated modified medium closely resembles human plasma. 
these studies implicate oligomerization clag paralogs encoded various
chromosomes channel formation. also reveal clag3 dispensable
under standard vitro conditions required propagation under
physiological conditions.
