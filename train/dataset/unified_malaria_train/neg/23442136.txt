position effect variegation (pev) refers quasi-stable patterns gene
expression observed specific loci throughout genomes of
eukaryotes. genes subjected pev completely silenced fully
active. stochastic conversions 2 states responsible the
variegated phenotypes. positional variegation used human pathogens
(trypanosoma, plasmodium, candida) evade immune system adapt the
host environment. yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae saccharomyces pombe,
telomeric pev aids adaptation changing environment. metazoans,
similar epigenetic conversions likely accompany cell differentiation and
the setting tissue-specific gene expression programs. surprisingly, know
very little mechanisms epigenetic conversions. article,
earlier models nature pev revisited recent advances the
dynamic nature chromatin reviewed. normal dynamic histone turnover
during transcription dna replication perturbation transcription
and replication pause sites discussed. proposed perturbations
play key roles epigenetic conversions pev.
