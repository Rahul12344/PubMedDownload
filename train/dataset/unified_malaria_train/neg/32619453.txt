advances infectious disease control strategies genetic manipulation of
insect microbiomes heightened interest microbially produced small
molecules within mosquitoes. herein, 33 mosquito-associated bacterial genomes
were mined 700 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (bgcs) were
identified, 135 belong known classes bgcs. in-depth
analysis 135 bgcs, iron-binding siderophores chosen further
investigation due high abundance well-characterized bioactivities.
through various metabolomic strategies, eight siderophore scaffolds were
identified six strains mosquito-associated bacteria. among these,
serratiochelin pyochelin found reduce female anopheles gambiae
overall fecundity likely lowering blood-feeding rate. serratiochelin a
and pyochelin found inhibit plasmodium parasite asexual blood
and liver stages in vitro. work supplies bioinformatic resource future 
mosquito-microbiome studies highlights understudied source bioactive
small molecules.
