intermittent preventive treatment (ipt) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in
vulnerable populations reduces malaria morbidity africa, resistance
mutations parasite dhps gene (combined dhfr mutations) threaten its
efficacy. update systematic review map prevalence k540e a581g 
mutations 294 surveys infected humans across africa 2004-present.
interpreting data complicated multiclonal infections humans,
especially high transmission areas. extend statistical methods estimate 
the frequency, i.e. proportion resistant clones parasite population
at location, standardise varying transmission levels. k540e 
and a581g mutations increased prevalence frequency 60% areas after
2008, highlighting need ongoing surveillance. resistance measures within 
countries similar within 300â€‰km, suggesting appropriate spatial scale for
surveillance. spread mutations tended accelerate prevalence 
exceeded 10% (prior fixation). frequencies resistance parasite
populations lower prevalence humans, areas would 
be classified likely benefit ipt similar frequency thresholds 
applied. propose use resistance frequencies well prevalence 
measures policy decisions evaluated.
