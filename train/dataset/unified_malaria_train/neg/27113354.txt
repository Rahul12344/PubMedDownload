background: malaria remains public health challenge sub-saharan africa 
plasmodium falciparum principal cause malaria disease morbidity 
mortality. plasmodium falciparum virulence attributed, part, its
population-level genetic diversity-a characteristic yet studied in
rwanda. characterizing p. falciparum molecular epidemiology area needed 
for better understand malaria transmission inform choice malaria
control strategies.
methods: health-facility based survey, malaria case clinical profiles and
parasite densities well parasite genetic diversity compared among p.
falciparum-infected patients identified two sites different malaria
transmission intensities rwanda. data demographics clinical features
and finger-prick blood samples microscopy parasite genotyping were
collected(.) nested pcr used genotype msp-2 alleles fc27 3d7.
results: patients' variables age group, sex, fever (both patient report and
by measured tympanic temperatures), parasite density, bed net use found 
differentially distributed higher endemic (ruhuha) lower endemic 
(mubuga) sites. overall multiplicity p. falciparum infection (moi) 1.73
but mean moi found vary significantly 2.13 ruhuha 1.29 
mubuga (p < 0.0001). ruhuha, expected heterozygosity (eh) fc27 3d7
alleles 0.62 0.49, respectively, whilst mubuga, eh fc27 3d7
were 0.26 0.28, respectively.
conclusions: study, higher geometrical mean parasite counts, more
polyclonal infections, higher moi, higher allelic frequency observed at 
the higher malaria-endemic (ruhuha) compared lower malaria-endemic
(mubuga) area. differences malaria risk moi considered
when choosing setting-specific malaria control strategies, assessing p.
falciparum associated parameters drug resistance, immunity impact 
used interventions, proper interpretation malaria vaccine studies.
