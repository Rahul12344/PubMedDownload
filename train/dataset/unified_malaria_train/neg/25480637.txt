the molecular pathways regulate megakaryocyte production historically
been identified multiple candidate gene approaches. several transcription
factors critical generating megakaryocytes identified promoter
analysis megakaryocyte-specific genes, biological roles then
verified gene knockout studies; example, gata-1, nf-e2, runx1 were
identified way. contrast, transcription factors important for
megakaryopoiesis discovered systems approach; example, c-myb
was found critical erythroid versus megakaryocyte lineage decision 
by genome-wide loss-of-function studies. regulation levels these
transcription factors is, part, cell intrinsic, although that
assumption recently challenged. epigenetics also impacts megakaryocyte
gene expression, mediated histone acetylation methylation. several
cytokines identified regulate megakaryocyte survival, proliferation,
and differentiation, prominent thrombopoietin. upon binding to
its receptor, product c-mpl proto-oncogene, thrombopoietin induces a
conformational change activates number secondary messengers that
promote cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, down-modulate
receptor signaling. among best studied signal transducers and
activators transcription (stat) proteins; phosphoinositol-3-kinase;
mitogen-activated protein kinases; phosphatases pten, shp1, shp2, ship1; 
and suppressors cytokine signaling (socs) proteins. additional signals
activated secondary mediators include mammalian target rapamycin;
β(beta)-catenin; g proteins rac1, rho, cdc42; several transcription
factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1α(alpha), homeobox-containing
proteins hoxb4 hoxa9, number signaling mediators reduced,
including glycogen synthase kinase 3α(alpha) foxo3 family forkhead
proteins. recently, systematic interrogation several aspects of
megakaryocyte formation conducted, employing genomics, proteomics, 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) analyses, among others, yielded
many previously unappreciated signaling mechanisms regulate megakaryocyte
lineage determination, proliferation, differentiation. chapter focuses
on pathways normal neoplastic megakaryopoiesis, suggests areas
that ripe study.
