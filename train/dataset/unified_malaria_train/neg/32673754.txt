tick salivary glands secrete complex saliva hosts modulates
vertebrate hemostasis, immunity tissue repair mechanisms. transcriptomic
studies revealed large number transcripts coding structural secreted
protein products single tick species. transcripts organized in
several large families according products. transcripts are
expressed time, transcription profile switches intervals,
characterizing phenomenon "sialome switching". work, using
transcriptomic proteomic analysis explored sialome rhipicephalus
sanguineus (s.l.) adult female ticks feeding rabbit. correlations
between transcriptional translational results different groups were
evaluated, confirming "sialome switching" validating idea the
expression switch may serve mechanism escape host immunity.
recombination breakpoints identified lipocalin metalloprotease
families, indicating mechanism could possible source diversity in
the tick sialome. another remarkable observation identification of
host-derived proteins component tick salivary gland content. these
results disclosed sequences contribute understanding tick feeding
biology, development novel anti-tick methods, discovery of
novel pharmacologically active products. significance: ticks burden by
themselves humans animals, vectors viral, bacterial, protozoal 
helminthic diseases. saliva anti-clotting, anti-platelet, vasodilatory 
and immunomodulatory activities allows successful feeding pathogen
transmission. previous transcriptomic studies indicate ticks one
thousand transcripts coding secreted salivary proteins. transcripts
code proteins diverse families, transcribed
simultaneously, rather transiently, succession. explored the
salivary transcriptome proteome brown dog tick, rhipicephalus
sanguineus. protein database 20 thousand sequences "de novo"
assembled 600 million nucleotide reads, two thousand
polypeptides identified mass spectrometry. proteomic data shown
to vary time transcription profiles, validating idea the
expression switch may serve mechanism escape host immunity.
analysis transcripts coding lipocalin metalloproteases indicate
their genes contain signals breakpoint recombination suggesting new
mechanism responsible large diversity tick salivary proteins. these
results disclosed sequences contribute understanding the
success ticks enjoy ectoparasites, development novel anti-tick
methods, discovery novel pharmacologically active products.
