anti-bacterial proteins mosquitoes known play important modulatory
role immune responses infections human pathogens including malaria
parasites. study characterized two members anopheles gambiae
nimrod superfamily, namely agnimb2 ageater. confirm current
annotation an. gambiae genome incorrectly identifies agnimb2 ageater
as single gene, agap009762. silico experimental approaches, it
has shown agnimb2 secreted protein mediates phagocytosis of
staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli bacteria. also reveal that
this function involve direct interaction agnimb2 s. aureus.
therefore, agnimb2 may act downstream complement-like pathway activation,
first requiring bacterial opsonization. addition, shown that
agnimb2 anti-plasmodium effect. conversely, ageater membrane-bound
protein either functions redundantly dispensable phagocytosis of
e. coli s. aureus. study provides insights role members the
complex nimrod superfamily an. gambiae, important african vector of
human malaria.
