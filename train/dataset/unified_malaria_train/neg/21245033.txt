over 50% genes plasmodium falciparum, deadliest human malaria parasite,
contain predicted introns, yet experimental characterization splicing 
organism remains incomplete. present transcriptome-wide
characterization intraerythrocytic splicing events, captured rna-seq
data four timepoints single highly synchronous culture. gene
model-independent analysis data conjunction publically available
rna-seq data hmmsplicer, in-house developed splice site detection
algorithm, revealed total 977 new 5' gu-ag 3' 5 new 5' gc-ag 3'
junctions absent gene models ests (11% increase current
annotation). addition, 310 alternative splicing events detected 254
(4.5%) genes, truncate open reading frames. splicing events
antisense gene models also detected, revealing complex transcriptional
arrangements within parasite's transcriptome. interestingly, antisense
introns overlap sense introns would expected chance, perhaps
indicating functional relationship overlapping transcripts an
inherent organizational property transcriptome. independent experimental
validation confirmed 30 new antisense alternative junctions. thus, 
largest assemblage new alternative splicing events date plasmodium
falciparum provides precise, dynamic view parasite's transcriptome.
