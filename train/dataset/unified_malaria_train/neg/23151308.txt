background: last 6 decades, rodent plasmodium species become key
model systems understanding basic biology malaria parasites. cell 
molecular parasitology made much progress identifying genes underpinning 
interactions malaria parasites, hosts, vectors. however, little
attention paid evolutionary genetics parasites, provides
context identifying potential therapeutic targets understanding the
selective forces shaping parasites natural populations. additionally,
understanding relationships species, subspecies, strains, is
necessary maximize utility rodent malaria parasites medically
important infectious disease models, investigating evolution of
host-parasite interactions.
results: here, collected multi-locus sequence data 58 rodent malaria
genotypes distributed throughout 13 subspecies belonging p. berghei, p.
chabaudi, p. vinckei, p. yoelii. employ multi-locus methods infer the
subspecies phylogeny, use population-genetic approaches elucidate the
selective patterns shaping evolution organisms. results reveal a
time-line evolution rodent plasmodium suggest the
subspecies independently evolving lineages (i.e. species). show that
estimates species-level polymorphism inflated subspecies not
explicitly recognized, detect purifying selection loci.
conclusions: work resolves previous inconsistencies phylogeny of
rodent malaria parasites, provides estimates important parameters relate 
to parasite's natural history provides much-needed evolutionary context
for understanding diverse biological aspects cross-reactivity immune 
responses parasite mating patterns.
