background: malaria caused plasmodium falciparum one leading causes 
of human morbidity mortality infectious diseases, predominantly in
tropical sub-tropical countries. genetic variations toll-like
receptors (tlrs)-signalling pathway associated either
susceptibility resistance several infectious inflammatory diseases, the
supposition single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) tlr2, tlr4, tlr9,
toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (tirap) fcgr2a 
could modulate malaria susceptibility severity.
methods: study planned make contribution solving the
problem real role common polymorphisms tlr4, tlr9, tirap
and fcgr2a genes modulating risk malaria disease severity in
children burundi, central africa. paediatric patients aged six
months 10 years admitted hospital kiremba, burundi, february
2011 september 2011, fever suspicion acute malaria screened
for malaria parasitaemia light microscopy thick thin blood smears. in
children malaria uninfected controls enrolled study period
in hospital, blood samples obtained filter paper tlr4
asp299gly rs4986790, tlr9 g1174a rs352139, t-1486 c rs187084 tlr9 t-1237 c

polymorphisms studied using abi prism 7900 ht fast real-time instrument.
results: total 602 patients 337 controls enrolled. among the
malaria cases, 553 (91.9%) considered suffering uncomplicated 49
(8.1%) severe malaria. tlr9 t1237c rs5743836cc associated an
increased risk developing malaria (p=0.03), although found the
same frequency uncomplicated severe malaria cases. differences
were found alleles studied genotype frequencies malaria
cases uninfected controls well uncomplicated severe malaria
cases.
conclusions: tlr9 t1237c seems condition susceptibility malaria in
burundian children severity, whereas none assessed snps of
tlr4, tirap fcgr2a seem influence susceptibility malaria disease
severity population.
