background: drosophila melanogaster activates variety immune responses
against microbial infections. however, information drosophila immune
response entomopathogenic nematode infections currently limited. the
nematode heterorhabditis bacteriophora insect parasite forms a
mutualistic relationship gram-negative bacteria photorhabdus
luminescens. following infection, nematodes release bacteria quickly
multiply within insect produce several toxins eventually kill the
host. although currently know insect immune system interacts with
photorhabdus, information interaction nematode vector scarce.
results: used next generation rna-sequencing analyze the
transcriptional profile wild-type adult flies infected axenic
heterorhabditis nematodes (lacking photorhabdus bacteria), symbiotic
heterorhabditis nematodes (carrying photorhabdus bacteria), photorhabdus
bacteria alone. obtained approximately 54 million reads the
different infection treatments. bioinformatic analysis shows infection 
photorhabdus alters transcription large number drosophila genes
involved translational repression well response stress. however,
heterorhabditis infection alters transcription several genes that
participate lipidhomeostasis metabolism, stress responses, dna/protein
synthesis neuronal functions. also identified genes fly with
potential roles nematode recognition, anti-nematode activity nociception.
conclusions: findings provide fundamental information molecular
events take place drosophila upon infection two pathogens,
either separately together. large-scale transcriptomic analyses set the
stage future functional studies aimed identifying exact role key
factors drosophila immune response nematode-bacteria complexes.
