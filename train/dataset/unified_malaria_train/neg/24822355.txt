objective: investigate potential interaction apiap2 protein
family member, pf3d7_1107800, var intron plasmodium falciparum vivo.
methods: genomic dna extracted plasmodium falciparum (3d7 strain), 5'
end gene fragment pf3d7_1107800 amplified pcr, cloned into
pgex-4t-1 vector. constructed pgex-4t-1-pf3d7_1107800n transformed into
e. coli bl21 (de3) followed expression protein induced iptg. the
recombinant protein purified glutathione sepharose. twenty female
balb/c mice divided 2 group. ten mice experiment group were
immunized mixture purified protein freund's adjuvant by
subcutaneous injection. 10 mice received pbs injection control. sera
from mice 2 group purified protein g. effect antibody was
testified western blotting. dna products chip assay analyzed for
enrichment anti-pf3d7_1107800 group ups c var intron qpcr.
results: pcr result pf3d7_1107800 gene 5' end segment showed there
was specific band (about 345 bp), consistent theoretical
value. constructed vector pgex-4t-1-pf3d7_1107800n confirmed gene
sequencing. sds-page western blotting analysis demonstrated the
recombinant protein mr 37,000. anti-pf3d7_1107800 serum was
obtained immunization mice purified protein, reacted
with recombinant protein, specific band mr 200,000. qpcr result
showed fold enrichment anti-pf3d7_1107800 group var intron two
times higher reference gene region.
conclusion: plasmodium falciparum apiap2 family member pf3d7_1107800 binds to
ups c var intron region vivo.
