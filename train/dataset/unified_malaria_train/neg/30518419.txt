background: merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) gene encodes leading
malaria vaccine candidate antigen. however, extensive polymorphic nature
represents major obstacle development protective vaccine.
previously, pilot study carried explore sequence variation of
the c-terminal 42 kda fragment within p. knowlesi msp-1 gene (pkmsp-142) based on
12 clinical samples; however, study adequate sample size vital
in estimating genetic diversity parasite population.
methods: present study, included larger sample size p. knowlesi
(83 samples) covering eight states malaysia determine genetic
polymorphism, natural selection haplotype groups gene fragment coding 
pkmsp-142. region flanking pkmsp-142 amplified pcr directly
sequenced. genetic diversity, haplotype diversity, population genetic
differentiation natural selection determined order study the
polymorphic characteristic pkmsp-142.
results: high level genetic diversity (hd = 0.970 ± 0.007; л = 0.01079 ±
0.00033) observed among 83 p. knowlesi samples, confirming extensive 
genetic polymorphism exhibited among p. knowlesi population found in
malaysia. total 18 distinct haplotypes 17 amino acid changes were
identified, whereby 15 new haplotypes. high population differentiation
values observed within samples peninsular malaysia malaysian
borneo. 42 kda fragments p. knowlesi malaysian borneo found to
be acting balancing selection whilst purifying selection suggested act 
on isolates peninsular malaysia. separation pkmsp-142 haplotypes into
two main groups based geographical separation supported the
existence two distinct p. knowlesi lineages.
conclusions: high level genetic diversity observed among pkmsp-142 in
malaysia, whereby polymorphisms found within 33 kda region. 
taken together, data useful order understand nature p.
knowlesi population malaysia well design development a
msp-142 based knowlesi malaria vaccine.
