the variant surface antigen pfemp1 (plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1) encoded polymorphic multi-copy var gene family plays an
important role parasite biology host-parasite interactions.
sequestration antigenic variation essential component survival
and pathogenesis plasmodium falciparum contributes chronic infection.
the dblα domain pfemp1 potential target immuno-epidemiological
studies visualized vaccine candidate severe malaria.
specific host receptors like heparin, heparan sulphate, blood group and
complement receptor 1 reported bind dblα domain. although
heparin experimentally shown disrupt parasite-host interaction
and effectively disrupt rosetting, binding sites dblα domain 
mechanism behind heparin-mediated rosette inhibition elucidated. in
this study, 3d structures epitopes dblα domain 3d7 two
indian isolates predicted compared. carried docking
studies dblα domains human gag receptors (heparin heparan sulphate)
to predict strength association protein-ligand interactions.
the dblα domain structures showed extensive diversity polymorphism their
binding sites. docking results indicate heparin binds effectively
with high affinity compared heparan sulphate common interacting
residues. common residues play important role rosetting 
aid designing inhibitors specific interactions dblα 
heparin heparan sulphate would important malaria treatment. thus may 
lead development novel interference strategies block red blood cell 
invasion provide protection malaria.
