epigenetic mechanisms dna methylation histone post-translational
modifications fundamental phenotypic plasticity insects during
their interaction environment. response environmental cues, the
methylation pattern dna dynamically remodeled achieve epigenetic
control gene expression. dna methylation focus study insects 
its evolutionarily conserved character; however, scant knowledge about
the epigenetic regulation vector mosquitoes, especially infection
by parasites. aim present study evaluate participation of
dna methylation immune response anopheles albimanus plasmodium
infection. this, first investigated presence fully functional dna
methylation system a. albimanus assessing potential role larval
development. subsequently, evaluated transcriptional response to
plasmodium berghei two mosquito phenotypes different degrees of
susceptibility parasite, scenario global dna methylation 
had pharmacologically inhibited. study revealed a. albimanus 
functional dna methylation system essential larval viability, that
is also responsive feeding parasite challenges. pharmacological
erasure methylome azacytidine decitabine abolished divergent
responses mosquito phenotypes, leading transcriptionally similar
response upon parasite challenge. response specific, the
infection load phenotypes lowered. findings suggest dna
methylation may constitute key factor vector competence, promising
target preventing malaria transmission.
