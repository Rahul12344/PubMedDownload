background: antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 key parasite mechanism immune evasion parasite survival.
it assumed number parasites expressing var gene must
reach high enough numbers host produce detectable levels of
antibodies (ab) variant. var2csa protein coded one 60 var
genes expressed surface infected erythrocytes (ie) mediates
ie binding placenta. idea ab var2csa pregnancy-associated 
was challenged var2csa-specific ab reported children men.
however, frequency conditions ab var2csa produced
outside pregnancy unclear. study sought determine frequency,
specificity level ab var2csa produced children whether children 
with hyperparasitaemia severe malaria likely produce ab to
var2csa compared healthy children.
methods: antibody responses panel recombinant proteins consisting of
multiple var2csa duffy-binding-like domains (dbl) full-length var2csa (fv2)
were characterized 193 1-15 year old children rural cameroonian villages 
and 160 children severe malaria city.
results: low ab levels var2csa detected children; however, ab levels
to fv2 teenagers rare. children preferentially recognized dbl2 (56-70%)
and dbl4 (50-60%), multigravidae produced high levels igg dbl3, dbl5 
and fv2. sixty-seven percent teenage girls (n = 16/24) recognized id1-id2a
region var2csa. children severe forms malaria significantly higher
igg merozoite antigens (all p < 0.05), var2csa (all p > 0.05) 
compared healthy children.
conclusion: study suggests children, including teenage girls acquire ab 
to var2csa domains fv2, ab levels much lower needed to
protect women placental infections repertoire ab responses dbl
domains different pregnant women. interestingly, children with
severe malaria higher ab levels var2csa compared healthy
children.
