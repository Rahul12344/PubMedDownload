background: artemisinin resistance associated delayed parasite clearance 
half-life vivo correlates ring-stage survival under
dihydroartemisinin vitro. phenotypes associated mutations the
pf3d7_1343700 pfkelch13 gene. recent spread artemisinin resistance and
emerging piperaquine resistance southeast asia show artemisinin
combination therapy, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, losing clinical 
effectiveness, prompting investigation drug resistance mechanisms and
development strategies surmount emerging anti-malarial resistance.
methods: sixty-eight parasites isolates vivo clearance data obtained
from two tracking resistance artemisinin collaboration study sites in
cambodia, culture-adapted, genotyped pfkelch13 mutations
including pfmdr1 copy number; rsa0-3h survival rates response to
antimalarial drugs vitro measured 36 isolates.
results: among 36 parasites one isolate demonstrated increased ring-stage
survival pfkelch13 mutation (d584v, rsa0-3h = 8%), previously associated
with slow clearance yet tested vitro. several parasites exhibited
increased ring-stage survival, yet lack pfkelch13 mutations, one isolate
showed evidence piperaquine resistance.
conclusions: study 68 culture-adapted plasmodium falciparum clinical
isolates cambodia known clearance values, associated d584v
pfkelch13 mutation increased ring-stage survival identified parasites
that lack pfkelch13 mutations yet exhibit increased ring-stage survival. these
data suggest mutations found pfkelch13 may involved in
conferring artemisinin resistance p. falciparum. piperaquine resistance was
also detected among cambodian samples, consistent reports of
emerging piperaquine resistance field. culture-adapted parasites
permit investigation mechanisms artemisinin piperaquine
resistance development strategies prevent overcome anti-malarial
resistance.
