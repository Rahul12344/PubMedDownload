background: context generalization insecticide resistance, the
hypothesis insecticide resistance positive impact capacity of
mosquitoes transmit malaria constitutes hindrance malaria elimination.
the aim study investigated populations anopheles coluzzii and
anopheles gambiae molecular form assess whether different genotypes the
kdr locus responsible different susceptibility plasmodium falciparum
infection.
methods: f3 progeny an. gambiae s.l. collected dielmo infected by
direct membrane feeding p. falciparum gametocyte-containing blood sampled
from volunteer patients. presence oocysts determined light
microscopy seven days, presence sporozoites elisa after
14 days. mosquito species molecular forms identified pcr. generalized
linear models performed using r software test effect of
explanatory variables including genotype kdr locus infection rate
and density.
results: odds infected oocysts sporozoites greater 
rs rr groups ss groups (χ2 = 42.8, df = 1, p(>χ2) = 6.1e-11). the
density infection also dependent genotype, rr rs genotypes
showing denser infection ss genotypes. pairwise comparisons oocyst number
and absorbance indicated sometime small betwen species (i.e. an.
gambiae form, an. coluzzii), effect genotype much more
important.
conclusion: presence resistance allele kdr locus increases
susceptibility plasmodium oocyst stage also the
sporozoite stage non-genetically modified wild mosquitoes. results 
significant implications taken account development of
strategies malaria control.
