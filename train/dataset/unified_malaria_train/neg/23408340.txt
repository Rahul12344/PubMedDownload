diversity parasite virulence one factors contribute the
clinical outcome malaria infections. association severity of
plasmodium falciparum malaria number distinct parasite populations
infecting host (multiplicity infection) polymorphism within 
specific antigen genes investigated. study included 164 children
presenting mild severe malaria central uganda malaria is
meso-endemic. polymorphic regions circumsporozoite protein (csp),
merozoite surface proteins 1 2 (msp1 msp2), glutamate-rich protein
(glurp) genotyped polymerase chain reaction methods fragment analysis
by gel electrophoresis. subset samples fragment analysis also
performed fluorescent pcr genotyping followed capillary electrophoresis.
the multiplicity infection (moi), determined highest number alleles 
detected within four genetic loci, significantly higher severe 
than mild malaria cases (mean 3.7 3.0, respectively, p=0.002). no
particular genotype allelic family msp1 msp2 associated with
severity malaria, genotyping method reveal significant
difference moi assessed msp2 genotyping. severity malaria 
not linked predominance particular msp1 msp2 allelic types,
independent methods used genotyping. monitoring dynamics multiple
clone infections relation disease outcome, host immune status genetic
factors provide insight parasite virulence mechanisms.
