living organisms evolved array genes coding detoxifying enzymes
and efflux protein pumps, cope endogenous xenobiotic toxic compounds.
the study genes activated toxic exposure relevant area of
arthropod vector control, since genes one targets upon which
natural selection acts evolution insecticide resistance. atp-binding
cassette (abc) transporters participate insecticide detoxification acting as
efflux pumps, reduce intracellular concentration toxic compounds, 
of metabolic derivatives. analyzed modulation expression
of six genes coding abc transporters, exposure adult females and
males mosquito anopheles stephensi, major malaria vector asia, to
permethrin. male female mosquitoes exposed insecticide one hour, 
then expression profiles abc transporter genes anstabcb2, anstabcb3,
anstabcb4, anstabcbmember6, anstabcc11, anstabcg4 analysed one and
24h. results showed three genes (anstabcb2, anstabcbmember6, anstabcg4) 
were up-regulated sexes; two (anstabcbmember6 anstabcg4)
have previously shown up-regulated also larval stages an.
stephensi, supporting role genes permethrin defence larvae as
well adults. finally, abc transporter genes activated in
females males; however, timing gene induction different, a
prompter induction females males.
