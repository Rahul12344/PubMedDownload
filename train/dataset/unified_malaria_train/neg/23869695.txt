objectives: use new drugs improved treatment multiple myeloma
and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl). nevertheless, time many patients 
relapse develop resistance treatment, efforts needed overcome
drug resistance. widely used malaria drug artesunate reported to
have antitumor activity, aimed test effects artesunate a
panel myeloma lymphoma cells.
methods: myeloma dlbcl cell lines treated artesunate vitro. 
effects artesunate treatment evaluated using atp content measurements for
proliferation annexin v/propidium iodide labeling apoptosis. western
blotting used look artesunate-induced protein changes. addition, we
measured artesunate effects patient myeloma cells presence bone
marrow stromal cells.
results: artesunate treatment efficiently inhibited cell growth induced
apoptosis cell lines. apoptosis induced concomitantly downregulation 
of myc anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family proteins, well cleavage of
caspase-3. ic50 values artesunate cell lines varied 0.3 and
16.6 μm. furthermore, primary myeloma cells also sensitive to
artesunate doses around 10 μm. concentrations order are
pharmacologically relevant obtained plasma intravenous
administration artesunate malaria treatment.
conclusion: findings indicate artesunate potential drug for
treatment multiple myeloma dlbcl doses order currently
in use treatment malaria without serious adverse effects.
