c-mannosylation recently identified thrombospondin-related anonymous
protein (trap) plasmodium falciparum salivary gland sporozoites. candidate
p. falciparum c-mannosyltransferase (pfdpy-19) demonstrated modify
thrombospondin type 1 repeat (tsr) domains vitro, exhibiting different
acceptor specificity mammalian counterparts. according the
described minimal acceptor pfdpy19, several tsr domain-containing proteins 
p. falciparum could c-mannosylated vivo. however, relevance this
protein modification parasite viability remains unknown. present
study, used crispr/cas9 technology generate pfdpy19 null mutant,
demonstrating glycosyltransferase essential asexual
blood development parasite. pfdpy19 gene disruption associated
with growth phenotype, even endoplasmic reticulum-stressing
conditions could impair protein folding. data presented work
strongly suggest pfdpy19 unlikely play critical role asexual 
blood stages parasite, least vitro conditions.
