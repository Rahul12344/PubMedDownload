signatures recent positive selection often overlap across human populations,
but question often overlaps represent single ancestral event
remains unresolved. single selective event spread across many populations,
the sweeping haplotype appear population selective
pressure could common across populations environments. identifying such
shared selective events could identify genomic loci human traits important in
recent history across globe. addition, genomic annotations recently
became available could help attach signatures potential gene and
molecular phenotype selected across populations. here, present catalogue 
selective sweeps humans, identify overlap share sweeping 
haplotype. connect sweep overlaps potential biological mechanisms
at several loci, including potential new sites adaptive introgression, the
glycophorin locus associated malarial resistance alcohol
dehydrogenase cluster associated alcohol dependency.
