receptors (kir) control natural killer cell (nk) functions immunity and
reproduction. encoded genes different chromosomes, polymorphic
ligands receptors correlate highly disease resistance and
susceptibility. although studied low-resolution many populations,
high-resolution analysis combinatorial diversity hla class kir is

other end spectrum west african population investigated here: we
studied 235 individuals, including 104 mother-child pairs, ga-adangbe of
ghana. population rich diversity 175 kir variants forming 208 kir
haplotypes, 81 hla-a, -b -c variants forming 190 hla class haplotypes. 
each individual studied unique compound genotype hla class kir,
forming 1-14 functional ligand-receptor interactions. maintaining this
exceptionally high polymorphism balancing selection. centromeric region of
the kir locus, encoding hla-c receptors, highly diverse whereas telomeric 
region encoding bw4-specific kir3dl1, lacks diversity africans. present the
ga-adangbe high frequencies bw4-bearing hla-b*53:01 bw4-lacking

maintains numerous hla-b allotypes lacking bw4, also of
stronger weaker interaction lilrb1, kir-related receptor.
correspondingly, balance key residues kir3dl1 modulate 
level cell-surface expression. thus, capacity interact nk cells
