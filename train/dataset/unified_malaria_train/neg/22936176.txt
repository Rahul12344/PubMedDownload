malaria major cause morbidity worldwide reports 200-500
million infected individuals nearly 1 million deaths year. antibodies
have shown play critical role controlling blood stage this
disease; however, malaria-endemic areas antibody immunity slow develop
despite years exposure plasmodium spp. causative parasite. using rodent
plasmodium yoelii ym, provide evidence malarial infections result a
decrease proportion dcs express b-cell survival factor, baff, 
resulting decreased ability dcs support memory b-cell
differentiation antibody secreting cells (ascs) and/or survival ascs.
further, compared infected wt mice, asc numbers significantly increased
in malaria-infected transgenic mice either overexpressed baff mice with
baff-independent b-cell survival (b-cell-restricted traf3 deletion). remarkably, 
baff-overexpressing mice protected lethal malaria infections,
indicating significance role baff plays determining outcome 
malaria infections. findings describe previously unappreciated mechanism 
by plasmodium spp. depress generation protective antibody
responses.
