carriage density gametocytes, transmission stages malaria
parasites, determined predicting infectiousness humans to
mosquitoes. measure used evaluating interventions aim at
reducing malaria transmission. gametocytes need detected amplification
of stage-specific transcripts, requires rna-preserving blood sampling. 
simultaneous, highly sensitive quantification both, blood stages and
gametocytes, compared optimized different strategies field and
laboratory procedures cross sectional survey 315 5-9 yr old children from
papua new guinea. qrt-pcr performed gametocyte markers pfs25 pvs25,
plasmodium species prevalence determined targeting both, 18s rrna genes
and transcripts. rna-based parasite detection resulted p. falciparum
positivity 24.1%; 40.8% carried gametocytes. p. vivax positivity 
38.4%, 38.0% carrying gametocytes. sensitivity dna-based
parasite detection substantially lower 14.1% p. falciparum 19.6%
for p. vivax. using lower dna-based prevalence asexual stages a
denominator increased percentage gametocyte-positive infections 59.1%
for p. falciparum 52.4% p. vivax. studies requiring highly sensitive 
and simultaneous quantification sexual asexual parasite stages, 18s rrna
transcript-based detection saves efforts costs. rna-based positivity is
considerably higher methods. hand, dna-based parasite
quantification robust permits comparison globally generated
molecular prevalence data. molecular monitoring low density asexual sexual
parasitaemia support evaluation effects up-scaled antimalarial
intervention programs also inform small scale spatial variability
in transmission intensity.
