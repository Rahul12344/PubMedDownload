artemisinin well known irreplaceable curative effect the
devastating parasitic disease, malaria. sesquiterpenoid specifically
produced chinese traditional herbal plant artemisia annua. earlier studies
have shown phytohormone abscisic acid (aba) plays important role in
increasing artemisinin content, aba regulates artemisinin
biosynthesis still poorly understood. study, identified aaabf3
encoded abre (aba-responsive elements) binding factor. qrt-pcr analysis showed
that aaabf3 induced aba expressed much higher trichomes where
artemisinin synthesized accumulated. investigate mechanism 
of aaabf3 regulating artemisinin biosynthesis, carried dual-luciferase
analysis, yeast one-hybrid assay electrophoretic mobility shift assay. the
results revealed aaabf3 could directly bind promoter aldh1 gene,
which key gene artemisinin biosynthesis, activate expression of
aldh1. functional analysis revealed overexpression aaabf3 a. annua
enhanced production artemisinin, rna interference aaabf3 resulted
in decreased artemisinin content. taken together, results demonstrated that
aaabf3 played important role aba-regulated artemisinin biosynthesis through
direct regulation artemisinin biosynthesis gene, aldh1.
