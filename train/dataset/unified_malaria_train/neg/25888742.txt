background: micrornas small non-coding rnas involved various
biological processes including insect development. anopheles stephensi serves 
primary vector malaria parasite asia exhibits holometabolous life cycle
that involves four different stages development. regulation role of
mosquito mirnas various stages mosquito development remain largely
unknown.
methods: high throughput small rna sequencing employed identification and
profiling mirnas across immature adult stages malaria vector, which
were validated using northern hybridization real time pcr. target
prediction pathway analysis carried understand role of
regulated mirnas insect development. degradome sequencing employed to
identify cleaved targets regulated mirnas. loss function strategy 
employed mir-989 understand probable role female reproductive
process.
results: small rna sequencing data analysis revealed 111 14 known and
novel mirnas respectively across stages anopheles stephensi. nine mirnas
showed gender specific regulation across different stages mosquito
development. analysis mirnas revealed regulation 24 26 mirnas across
different stages male female mosquito development respectively. mrna
targets significant pathways targeted regulated mirnas identified for
each stage mosquito development. degradome sequencing revealed twenty nine
cleaved targets insect mirnas. microrna-989 showed significant up-regulation
in adult female compared adult male mosquito. knockdown mir-989
expression adult female using mirna specific antagomir affected targets
playing roles protein binding, proteolysis nucleic acid binding ovary
tissue female mosquito post blood feeding.
conclusions: first comprehensive effort understand regulation of
anopheles stephensi mirnas across developmental stages male female
mosquito. preliminary role regulated mirnas mosquito development was
revealed target prediction pathway analysis. microrna-989 emerged 
important roles adult female mosquitoes showing significant up-regulation
which studied using mir-989 specific antagomir. study provides
insights mosquito development reproductive process implications 
for effective control mosquito population required reducing spread of
mosquito-borne infectious diseases.
