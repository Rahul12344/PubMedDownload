amodiaquine (aq) developed selective drug plasmodium falciparum 
malaria infection received increasing attention therapeutic agent
for treatment rheumatoid arthritis, parkinson's disease, cancer due to
its anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, autophagic-lysosomal blockade
properties. autophagy activation involved promoting adipogenic
differentiation, examined whether anti-autophagic aq affected adipocyte
differentiation 3t3-l1 pre-adipocytes. aq dose-dependently significantly
suppressed adipocyte differentiation conjunction decreases lipid
droplet formation expression adipogenic markers including adiponectin,
adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (ap2), resistin, leptin. although
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (pparγ) decreases inhibition of
autophagy, aq treatment induce pparγ degradation despite suppression 
of autophagolysosomal degradation. instead, aq suppressed pparγ activity to
transcriptionally activate ap2 gene transcription selective
prevention nuclear localization pparγ. results demonstrated novel
anti-adipogenic activity aq identified underlying mechanism aq
suppressed adipogenic gene expression lipid formation inhibiting nuclear
localization pparγ autophagy-independent manner. aq recommended 
safe effective anti-obesity drug controlling overweight obesity.
