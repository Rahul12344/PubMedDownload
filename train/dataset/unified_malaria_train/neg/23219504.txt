ruvb family protein contains two similar kinds proteins i.e. ruvb1 and
ruvb2 yeast human. proteins belong aaa+ class proteins
and critical components several multiprotein complexes involved diverse
cellular activities. two ruvb proteins annotated plasmodium
database identification third protein recently lab has
raised question plasmodium falciparum contains three ruvb proteins
instead two. hence biochemical characterizations proteins have
become essential understand role proteins malaria
parasite. recently reported characterization recombinant
pfruvb3, contains atpase activity lacks dna helicase activity. the
present study report phylogenetic analysis detailed biochemical
characterization one ruvb homologue ruvb1 p. falciparum.
pfruvb1 shows considerable homology human well yeast ruvb1 and
contains walker motif walker motif b. activity analysis protein
revealed pfruvb1 atpase activity increased significantly in
the presence ss-dna. pfruvb1 also contains dna helicase activity and
translocates preferentially 5' 3' direction. vivo investigation of
pfruvb1 revealed constitutively expressed stages of
intraerythrocytic cycle p. falciparum localizes mainly nucleus.
these studies make important contribution understanding role ruvb 
protein p. falciparum.
