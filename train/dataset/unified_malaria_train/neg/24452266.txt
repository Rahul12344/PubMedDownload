both host parasite factors contribute disease severity malaria
infection; however, molecular mechanisms responsible disease 
host-parasite interactions involved remain largely unresolved. investigate the
effects parasite factors host immune responses pathogenesis, we
measured levels plasma cytokines/chemokines (ccs) growth rates mice
infected two plasmodium yoelii strains different virulence phenotypes
and progeny genetic cross two parasites. quantitative trait loci
(qtl) analysis linked levels many ccs, particularly il-1β, ip-10, ifn-γ, mcp-1
and mig, early parasite growth rate loci multiple parasite chromosomes,
including chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12 13. comparison genome sequences
spanning mapped loci revealed various candidate genes. loci on
chromosomes 7 13 significant (p<0.005) additive effects il-1β, il-5
and ip-10 responses, chromosome 9 12 loci significant (p=0.017)
interaction. infection knockout mice showed critical roles mcp-1 il-10 
in parasitemia control host mortality. results provide important
information better understanding malaria pathogenesis used to
examine role factors human malaria infection.
