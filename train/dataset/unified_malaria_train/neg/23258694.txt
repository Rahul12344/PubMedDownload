there variety methods used estimate effectiveness antimalarial
drugs clinical trials, invariably per-person basis. person, however,
may one malaria infection present time treatment. we
evaluate currently used methods analysing malaria trials per-individual 
basis introduce novel method estimate cure rate per-infection
(clone) basis. used simulated real data highlight differences of
the various methods. give special attention classifying outcomes cured, 
recrudescent (infections never fully cleared) ambiguous basis of
genetic markers three loci. estimate cure rates per-clone basis, we
used genetic information within individual treatment determine
the number clones present. used genetic information obtained the
time treatment failure classify clones recrudescence new infections. 
on per-individual level, find accurate methods of
classification label individual newly infected alleles different
at beginning time failure recrudescence some
alleles same. appropriate analysis method survival analysis 
or alternatively complete data/per-protocol analysis proportion estimate
that treats new infections successes. show analysis drug
effectiveness per-clone basis estimates cure rate accurately allows 
more detailed evaluation performance treatment.
