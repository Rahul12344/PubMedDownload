background: anopheles sinensis major vector malaria china its
control great threat development insecticide resistance.
voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) target several classes of
insecticides. genetic mutations vgsc documented confer knockdown 
resistance (kdr) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt) pyrethroids in
mosquitoes. control vector efficiently, important know the
resistance-associated genetic mutations, distribution frequencies and
genealogical relations.
methods: three hundreds thirteen (313) adults an. sinensis collected 
nine locations across guangxi zhuang autonomous region used. partial
sequence an. sinensis voltage gated sodium channel gene (as-vgsc)
containing codon 1014 sequenced. phase2.1 used construct the
haplotypes individual, accuracy haplotypes further
confirmed clone sequencing. genealogical relations kdr mutations in
as-vgsc analysed using tcs 2.1 network 5.0.
results: sixteen as-vgsc haplotypes including seven haplotypes carrying
non-synonymous mutations codon 1014, fifty-five as-vgsc genotypes were
identified 313 mosquitoes collected nine geographical locations across 
guangxi. number haplotypes nine populations ranged 5
to 13. frequency haplotypes carrying kdr mutations ranged 2.7 to
80.0Â % within nine populations, 1014c unexpectedly high the
northeast guangxi. genealogical analysis suggested multiple origins kdr
mutations an. sinensis.
conclusion: diverse haplotypes as-vgsc distributed guangxi. the
presence haplotypes carrying mutations codon 1014 indicates risk of
pyrethroid ddt resistance. kdr mutations show differential distribution
geographically, high frequencies occurred northeast guangxi.
genealogical analysis suggests multiple origins kdr mutations an. sinensis 
populations guangxi. findings important practical implications 
the sustainability an. sinensis control programmes.
