an inflammatory response essential combating invading pathogens. several
effector components, well immune cell populations, involved mounting
an immune response, thereby destroying pathogenic organisms bacteria,
fungi, viruses, parasites. past decade, micrornas (mirnas), group of
noncoding small rnas, emerged functionally significant regulatory
molecules significant capability fine-tuning biological processes.
the important role mirnas inflammation immune responses highlighted 
by studies regulation mirnas host shown related 
to infectious diseases associated eradication susceptibility of
the infection. here, review biological aspects micrornas, focusing on
their roles regulators gene expression pathogen-host interactions
and implications immune response leishmania, trypanosoma,
toxoplasma, plasmodium infectious diseases.
