haemocytes respond infection phagocytosing pathogens, producing enzymes
that drive phenoloxidase-based melanization cascade, secreting lytic factors,
and producing humoral proteins. subset haemocytes, called periostial
haemocytes, aggregate surface heart mosquitoes kill
pathogens areas high haemolymph flow. periostial haemocytes always
present, infection induces recruitment additional haemocytes to
these regions. here, tested whether members nimrod gene family are
involved periostial immune response african malaria mosquito,
anopheles gambiae. using organismal manipulations, rna interference (rnai) and
microscopy, show that, following infection escherichia coli, nimrod - 
the orthologue drosophila nimb2 - involved periostial responses. 
4 h postinfection, however, rnai-based knockdown draper results marginal 
increase number periostial haemocytes doubling e. coli
accumulation periostial regions. finally, 24 h postinfection, knockdown
of eater decreases number periostial haemocytes decreases the
phagocytosis e. coli surface heart. phagocytosis bacteria 
more prevalent periostial regions mid abdominal segments, and
knockdown draper, nimrod eater alter distribution. finally,
knockdown nimrod family genes meaningful effect the
accumulation melanin periostial regions. study identifies roles
for eater draper functional integration mosquito immune and
circulatory systems.
