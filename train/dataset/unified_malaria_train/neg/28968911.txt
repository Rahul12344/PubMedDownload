the main malaria vectors sub-saharan africa, anopheles gambiae (giles;
diptera: culicidae), normally breed clean water sources. however, evidence
suggests on-going adaptation anopheline species polluted breeding
habitats urban settings. study aimed understanding adaptation to
breeding water bodies different qualities, five selected mosquito
breeding sites urban accra, ghana. study sites also evaluated the
who water-quality parameters measure pollution, insecticide residues.
field mosquitoes evaluated five genes; cyp6p3, cyp4h19, cyp4h24,
gstd1-4, abcc11-associated insecticide detoxification-using quantitative
rt-pcr, well mono-oxygenase, alpha esterase, glutathione s-transferase, and
insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ache) using biochemical enzyme assays. the
lab-reared, insecticide susceptible an. gambiae kisumu strain bred the
most polluted water source 10 generations evaluated genes
and enzymes. results revealed fold expression genes was
higher larvae compared adults. results also suggest that
detoxification enzymes could involved adaptation an. gambiae to
polluted breeding sites. correlation analysis revealed highly positive
significant correlation calcium levels five genes (p < 0.05).
stepwise linear regression understand variables predicted the
expression genes revealed sulphate responsible abcc11 and
cyp4h24, alkalinity gstd1-4, calcium cyp4h19 cyp6p3. detailed
genetic basis adaptation need investigated. further
understanding adaptation may provide outlooks controlling malaria and
other disease vectors adapted polluted breeding water sources.
