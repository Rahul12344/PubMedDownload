we evaluated dynamics parasite populations vitro culture
adaptation 15 mixed plasmodium falciparum infections, collected
from hypoendemic area near china-myanmar border. allele types msp1
block 2 initial clinical samples subsequent culture were
quantified weekly using quantitative pcr method. mixed infections carried
two allele types based msp1 genotyping result. also genotyped several
polymorphic sites dhfr, dhps mdr1 genes day 0 day 28, which
showed common sites analyzed monomorphic. two three 
clinical samples mixed dhps 581 remained stable one changed wild-type
during culture. vitro culture, observed gradual loss of
parasite populations 10 15 mixed infections becoming monoclonal by
day 28 based msp1 allele type. cases, abundant msp1
allele types clinical blood samples beginning culture became the
sole predominant allele types day 28. results suggest some
parasites may growth advantages loss parasite populations 
culture adaptation mixed infections may lead biased results comparing 
the phenotypes drug sensitivity culture-adapted parasites.
