erythrocyte invasion plasmodium merozoites complex, multistep process
that mediated number parasite ligand-erythrocyte receptor
interactions. one family parasite ligands includes p. falciparum
reticulocyte binding homologue (pfrh) proteins homologous p.
vivax reticulocyte binding proteins shown play role in
erythrocyte invasion. five functional pfrh proteins only
pfrh2a/2b yet demonstrated bind erythrocytes. study, 
demonstrated native pfrh2a/2b processed near n-terminus yielding
fragments 220 kda 80 kda exhibit differential erythrocyte binding
specificities. erythrocyte binding specificity 220 kda processed
fragment native pfrh2a/2b sialic acid-independent, trypsin resistant and
chymotrypsin sensitive. specific binding phenotype consistent with
previous studies disrupted pfrh2a/2b genes demonstrated pfrh2b 
is involved sialic acid independent, trypsin resistant, chymotrypsin
sensitive invasion pathway. interestingly, found smaller 80 kda
pfrh2a/2b fragment processed larger 220 kda fragment binds
erythrocytes sialic acid dependent, trypsin resistant chymotrypsin
sensitive manner. thus, two processed fragments pfrh2a/2b differed with
respect dependence sialic acids erythrocyte binding. further, 
mapped erythrocyte binding domain pfrh2a/2b conserved 40 kda
n-terminal region (rpfrh2(40)) ectodomain common pfrh2a
and pfrh2b. demonstrated recombinant rpfrh2(40) bound human erythrocytes 
with specificity native 220 kda processed protein. moreover,
antibodies generated rpfrh2(40) blocked erythrocyte invasion p.
falciparum sialic acid independent pathway. pfrh2a/2b thus plays key 
role erythrocyte invasion conserved receptor-binding domain deserves
attention promising candidate inclusion blood-stage malaria
vaccine.
