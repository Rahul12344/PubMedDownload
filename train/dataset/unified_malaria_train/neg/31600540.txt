background: malaria public health concern leads million
deaths worldwide every year. malaria caused genus plasmodium, which
includes p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. malariae, p. ovale. molecular phylogeny 
is essential better recognition evolution genus plasmodium genus
and detection relative degree plasmodium species humans. aim 
this study detect malaria light microscopy (lm) nested polymerase
chain reaction (nested pcr) methods peripheral blood expansions to
investigate genetic diversity plasmodium species 18s rrna gene the
southeast iran.
methods: total 97 blood smears collected patients suspected to
malaria 6-year period southeast iran including hormozgan, kerman, 
and sistan baluchestan provinces. diagnosis plasmodium species blood
smears performed using lm nested pcr methods. addition, 16
plasmodium-positive samples chosen determination genetic
diversity.
results: overall, 97 97 (100%) studied cases positive lm 94 of
97 (96.8%) detected malaria nested pcr. except seven
cases, nested pcr confirmed lm results. samples involved two p. vivax
and five p. falciparum lm method. meanwhile, nested pcr detected
in cases mixed infection p. vivax p. falciparum. the
results phylogenetic analysis revealed two main clades five different 
subclades. 87.5% isolates located clade contained p.
vivax. addition, 12.5% studied isolates involved p. falciparum was
in clade ii.
conclusion: according results, nested pcr method higher sensitivity
than lm suggested good approach malaria detection. consideration 
the wide diversity tested isolates importance vaccine development, 
which affected diversity, studies needed regard.
