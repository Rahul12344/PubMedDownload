background: plasmodium falciparum placental infection primes fetal immune
system alters infant immunity. mechanisms leading outcomes not
completely understood. focused vγ2vδ2 cells, part immune
response many pathogens, including p. falciparum. unconventional
lymphocytes respond directly small, nonpeptidic antigens, independent major
histocompatibility complex presentation. wondered whether placental malaria,
which may increase fetal exposure p. falciparum metabolites, triggers a
response neonatal vγ2vδ2 lymphocytes marker extent of
fetal exposure malarial antigens.
methods: cord blood mononuclear cells collected 15 neonates born to
mothers p. falciparum infection pregnancy (8 placental malaria) 
and 25 unexposed neonates. vγ2vδ2 cell phenotype, repertoire, proliferative
responses compared newborns exposed unexposed p.
falciparum.
results: placental malaria-exposed neonates increased proportions central 
memory vγ2vδ2 cells cord blood, altered vγ2 chain repertoire ex vivo
and stimulation.
conclusion: results suggest placental malaria affects phenotype 
repertoire neonatal vγ2vδ2 lymphocytes. placental malaria may lower the
capacity subsequent vγ2vδ2 cell responses impair natural resistance
to infectious diseases response pediatric vaccination.
