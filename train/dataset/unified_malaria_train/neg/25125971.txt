babesia microti emerging zoonotic protozoan organism causes
"malaria-like" symptoms fatal immunocompromised people. owing to
lack specific therapeutic regiment disease, cloned and
characterized b. microti lactate dehydrogenase (bmldh) potential molecular
drug receptor. vitro kinetic properties bmldh enzyme evaluated
using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad(+)) co-factor lactate 
substrate. inhibitory assay also done using gossypol bmldh inhibitor to
determine inhibitory concentration 50 (ic50). result showed 0.99
kbp bmldh gene codes barely soluble 36 kda protein (332 amino acids)
localized cytoplasm nucleus parasite. vitro enzyme
kinetic studies revealed bmldh active enzyme high
catalytic efficiency optimal ph 10.2. k values nad(+) lactate 
were 8.7 ± 0.57 mm 99.9 ± 22.33 mm, respectively. ic50 value gossypol
was 0.345 μm, 2.5 μm, gossypol caused 100% inhibition bmldh catalytic
activity. findings, therefore, provide initial evidence bmldh could be
a potential drug target, although vivo studies needed validate 
the practical application lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors b. microti 
infection.
