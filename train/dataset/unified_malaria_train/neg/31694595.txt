background: pesticides remain mainstay control agricultural pests 
and disease vectors. however, indiscriminate use agriculture led 
development resistance crop pests disease vectors. threatens 
to undermine success gained implementation chemical based
vector control programs. investigated practices farmers regard 
pesticide usage vegetable growing areas impact susceptibility
status an. gambiae s.l.
methods: stratified multistage sampling technique using administrative
structure tanzanian districts sampling frame used. wards, villages 
and participants farms pesticides applied purposively
recruited different stages process, 100 participants enrolled in
the study. villages used mosquito larvae sampling the
farms surveys complimented entomological study. larvae were
reared insectary emerging 2-3â€‰days old female adults anopheles 
gambiae s.l subjected susceptibility test.
results: forty eight pesticides different formulations used control
of crop livestock pests. pyrethroids mostly used class pesticides
(50%) organophosphates carbamates secondary importance. over
80% farmers applied pesticides mixed form. susceptibility test results 
confirmed high phenotypic resistance among an. gambiae populations ddt
and pyrethroids (permethrin-0.75%, cyfluthrin-0.15%, deltametrin-0.05% and
lambdacyhalothrin-0.05%) mortality rates 54, 61, 76 71%, respectively.
molecular analysis showed an. arabiensis dominant species (86%) an.
gambiae s.s constituted 6%. kdr genes detected the
specimens survived insecticide exposures.
conclusion: study found common use pyrethroids in
farms, livestocks well public health. study also reports high
phenotypic resistance among an. gambiae s.l pyrethroids
tested. preponderance pyrethroids agriculture public health
concern class insecticides widely used vector control
programs calls combined integrated pest vector management
