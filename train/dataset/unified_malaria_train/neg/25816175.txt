esophageal cancer common malignant tumor worldwide high incidence
rate china great threat human health. combined modality therapy
is used chemotherapeutic treatment esophageal cancer; however, drug
resistance side effects drugs major barrier success of
chemotherapy. chemotherapy common drugs far providing
satisfactory clinical outcomes patients esophageal cancer, more
efficient drugs urgently required. artesunate (art) first-line
treatment option malaria; however, recently revealed art has
remarkable anti-tumor activity, making novel candidate cancer
chemotherapy. although anti-cancer effects art well documented, 
its potential esophageal cancer rarely explored. present
study aimed investigate significance mechanism the
anti-proliferative activity art esophageal cancer cells vitro in
vivo. vitro experiments, art inhibited growth well induced
cell apoptosis cell cycle arrest esophageal cancer cell lines (eca109 
ec9706) concentration-dependent manner. furthermore, downregulation of
mitochondrial membrane potential, b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) cdc25a, well
as upregulation bcl-2â€‘associated x protein (bax) caspase-3 expression in
art-treated cells identified. addition, vivo study showed art 
produced dose-dependent tumor regression nude mice, side effects 
low. anti-tumor activity 200 mg/kg art similar 3 mg/kg
cisplatin. conclusion, art exerted concentration-dependent inhibitory activity
against esophageal cancer vivo vitro inducing cell apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest affecting mitochondrial membrane potential, bcl-2, bax,
caspase-3 cdc25a.
