background: artemether-lumefantrine (al) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
(dha/ppq) recommended first- second-line treatments, respectively,
for uncomplicated falciparum malaria somalia. studies reported were
conducted assess efficacy artemisinin-based combinations 
mutations plasmodium falciparum k13-propeller (pfk13) domain amplification
in pfplasmepsin 2 (pfpm2) gene somalia.
methods: one-arm prospective studies conducted assess clinical and
parasitological responses dha/ppq al two sites 2016 2017,
respectively, using standard protocol. patterns molecular markers 
associated artemisinin ppq resistance investigated first
time somalia.
results: total 339 patients enrolled 139 al 200 for
dha/ppq. al, parasite recurrence observed among patients treated at
either site, corresponding 100% clinical parasitological responses. for
dha-ppq, adequate clinical parasitological response rate > 97% was
observed. study patients treatments sites parasite-free 
on day 3. 138 samples interpretable results polymorphism in
pfk13, one (0.7%), bosaso, contained non-synonymous mutation (r622i),
which one known markers artemisinin resistance. pfpm2
amplification observed among 135 samples interpretable results.
conclusions: al dha/ppq highly effective treatment of
uncomplicated falciparum malaria, evidence resistance to
artemisinin ppq. two combinations thus relevant the
chemotherapeutic strategy malaria control somalia. trial registration
