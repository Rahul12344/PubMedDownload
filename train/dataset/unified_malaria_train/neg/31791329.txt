background: genetic complexity existence several polymorphisms 
parasites major hindrances malaria control programmes the
country. genetic profiling parasite populations india provide 
useful baseline data future studies elucidating parasite structure and
distribution drug resistance genotypes different regions.
methods: blood samples symptomatic patients collected analysed
for drug resistance genes (pfcrt, pfmdr-1, dhfr, dhps k13) gametocyte
genes (pfs25, pfg377); vitro drug sensitivity assay schizont maturation
inhibition (smi) also performed adapted field isolates.
results: 122 field isolates analysed; 65.5% showed pfcrt k76t mutant
alleles, 61.4% pfmdr-1 n86y mutants, 59.5% dhfr mutants, 59.8% dhps mutants was
observed, polymorphism seen k13. sequence analysis pfg377
gene revealed five types populations field isolates. inhibitory
concentrations (ic50) anti-malarial drugs viz chloroquine (cq), artesunate
(as), range 10.11-113.2 nm 2.26-4.08 nm, respectively, 
field isolates evaluate vitro assay. ic50 values cq shown a
remarkable reduction comparison previous available data, whereas a
slight increase ic50 values observed study.
conclusions: increase mutation rate drug resistance allelic loci with
inhibitory concentration cq drugs observed field isolates
and high diversity pfg377 gametocyte gene indicate towards parasite
multifactorial behaviour. knowledge prevalent drug resistance genes is
important intervention measures successful efforts also be
made prevent transmission p. falciparum.
