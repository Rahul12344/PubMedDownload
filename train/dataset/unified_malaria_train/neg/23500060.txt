we investigated efficacy types immune responses plasmid malaria
dna vaccine encoding vr1020-pymsp119 condensed surface of
polyethyleneimine (pei)-coated spions. vivo mouse studies done firstly to
determine optimum magnetic vector composition, observe immune
responses elicited magnetic vectors introduced via different
administration routes. higher serum antibody titers pymsp119 were
observed intraperitoneal intramuscular injections subcutaneous 
intradermal injections. robust igg2a igg1 responses observed for
intraperitoneal administration, could due physiology of
peritoneum major reservoir macrophages dendritic cells. heterologous 
dna prime followed single protein boost vaccination regime also enhanced
igg2a, igg1, igg2b responses, indicating induction appropriate memory 
immunity elicited protein recall. outcomes support the
possibility design superparamagnetic nanoparticle-based dna vaccines to
optimally evoke desired antibody responses, useful variety diseases
including malaria.
