artemisinin biosynthesized artemisia annua widely used the
treatment malaria. abscisic acid (aba)-responsive kinase 1 (aaapk1), member 
of snrk2 family, involved regulation artemisinin biosynthesis
through phosphorylation aabzip1, directly transactivates genes
involved artemisinin biosynthesis. diverse assays - including yeast
two-hybrid bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays - report that
the aba-responsive protein phosphatase aapp2c1 physically interacts aaapk1. 
in addition, phos-tag mobility shift assays indicate aapp2c1
dephosphorylates aaapk1. moreover, dual-luciferase assays demonstrate the
presence aapp2c1 reduces transactivation artemisinin biosynthesis genes
by aabzip1. results refine post-translational regulatory
network artemisinin biosynthesis, showing aapp2c1 negatively involved 
through dephosphorylation aaapk1.
