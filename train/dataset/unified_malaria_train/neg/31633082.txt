mounting evidence supports idea epigenetic, overall
3-dimensional (3d) architecture genome, plays important role gene
expression eukaryotic organisms. recently used hi-c methodologies to
generate compare 3d genome 7 different apicomplexan parasites,
including several pathogenic less pathogenic malaria parasites well as
related human parasites babesia microti toxoplasma gondii. goal to
understand possible relationship genome organization, gene
expression, pathogenicity infectious agents. collectively, our
results demonstrate spatial genome organization plasmodium species
is constrained colocalization virulence genes unique 
effect chromosome folding, indicating link genome organization and
gene expression virulent pathogens.
