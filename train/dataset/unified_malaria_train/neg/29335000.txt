background: human babesiosis infectious disease epidemic various
regions world. predominant causative pathogen disease is
the intra-erythrocytic parasite babesia microti. thioredoxin system one of
the major weapons used resistance reactive oxygen species
(ros) reactive nitrogen species (rns) produced host immune system. in
other intra-erythrocytic apicomplexans like malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum, anti-oxidative proteins promising targets development 
anti-parasitic drugs. however, date, sequences biological properties
of thioredoxins thioredoxin-like molecules b. microti remain unknown.
understanding molecular characterization function b. microti
thioredoxins may help develop anti-babesia drugs controlling babesiosis.
methods: full-length b. microti thioredoxin 2 (bmtrx2) gene obtained
using rapid amplification cdna ends (race) method, deduced bmtrx2
amino acid sequence analyzed using regular bioinformatics tools. recombinant 
bmtrx2 protein expressed vitro purified using his-tag protein affinity
chromatography resins. reverse transcription pcr, quantitative real-time pcr 
western blot employed detect expression native proteins of
bmtrx2. indirect immunofluorescence assay used localize bmtrx2 b.
microti. bovine insulin reduction assays used determine enzyme
activity purified recombinant bmtrx2 protein.
results: full-length bmtrx2 564 bp 408 bp open reading frame
encoding protein 135 amino acids. predicted molecular weight the
protein 15.5 kda. conserved thioredoxin-like family domain found in
bmtrx2. expression bmtrx2 upregulated third eighth day
post-infection mice, whereas expression downregulated beginning
and later stages. results western blot analysis showed native bmtrx2
in parasite lysates could detected mouse anti-bmtrx2 serum the
recombinant bmtrx2 protein could recognized serum b. microti-infected
mice. immunofluorescence microscopy showed bmtrx2 localized cell
cytoplasm b. microti merozoites b. microti-infected red blood cells. the
results bovine insulin reduction assay indicated purified recombinant
bmtrx2 protein possesses antioxidant enzyme activity. dihydroartemisinin and
quinine, known anti-malaria drugs, clindamycin, known anti-babesiosis drug,
induced significantly higher upregulation bmtrx2 mrna.
conclusions: results indicate bmtrx2 functional enzyme with
antioxidant activity may involved response b. microti to
anti-parasite drugs.
