leucine aminopeptidases m17 peptidase family represent ideal drug targets 
for therapies directed pathogens plasmodium, babesia trypanosoma.
previously, characterised toxoplasma gondii leucine aminopeptidase and
demonstrated role regulating levels free amino acids. this
study, evaluated potential t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase drug
target t. gondii knockout method. existing knockout methods t. gondii
have many drawbacks; therefore, developed new technique takes advantage
of crispr/cas9 system. first chose cas9 target site gene encoding
t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase constructed knockout vector
containing cas9 single guide rna. transfection, single tachyzoites 
were cloned 96-well plates limiting dilution. two transfected strains
derived single clone cultured vero cells, subjected to
expression analysis western blotting. phenotypic analysis revealed that
knockout t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase resulted inhibition of
attachment/invasion replication; growth attachment/invasion
capacity knockout parasites restored complementation a
synonymously substituted allele t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase. mouse
experiments demonstrated t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase knockout somewhat 
reduced pathogenicity t. gondii. enzymatic activity assay showed that
t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase knockout reduced processing leucine
aminopeptidase-specific substrate t. gondii. absence leucine
aminopeptidase activity could slightly compensated t. gondii. overall, 
t. gondii leucine aminopeptidase knockout influenced growth t. gondii, but
did completely block parasite development, virulence enzymatic activity.
therefore, conclude leucine aminopeptidase would useful an
adjunctive drug target t. gondii.
