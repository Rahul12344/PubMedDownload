background: determination genetic diversity malaria parasites can
inform intensity transmission identify potential deficiencies in
malaria control programmes. study conducted characterize genetic 
diversity allele frequencies plasmodium falciparum northwest ethiopia
along eritrea sudan border.
methods: total 90 isolates patients presenting local health
centre uncomplicated p. falciparum collected october 2014 to
january 2015. dna extracted polymorphic regions msp-1, msp-2
and glurp loci genotyped nested polymerase chain reactions followed by
gel electrophoresis fragment analysis.
results: allelic variation msp-1, msp-2 glurp identified 90 blood 
samples. total 34 msp alleles (12 msp-1 22 msp-2) detected.
for msp-1 97.8% (88/90), msp-2 82.2% (74/90) glurp 46.7% (42/90) were
detected. msp-1, mad20 predominant allelic family detected 47.7%
(42/88) isolates followed ro33 k1. msp-2, frequency fc27
and ic/3d7 77% (57/74) 76% (56/74), respectively. nine glurp rii region 
genotypes identified. seventy percent isolates multiple genotypes and
the overall mean multiplicity infection 2.6 (95% ci 2.25-2.97). the
heterozygosity index 0.82, 0.62 0.20 msp-1, msp-2 glurp,
respectively. significant association multiplicity of
infection age parasite density.
conclusions: high degree genetic diversity multiple clones in
p. falciparum isolates northwest ethiopia suggesting need
for improved malaria control efforts region.
