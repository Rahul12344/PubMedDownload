malaria plagues one every 30 humans contributes almost million
deaths, problem could worsen. current therapeutic options are
compromised emerging resistance parasite front line drugs. is
thus imperative better understand basic biology parasite and
develop novel drugs stem disease. facile approach analyse a
gene's function remove genome inhibit activity. although
genetic manipulation human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum a
relatively standard procedure, optimal method perturb genes
essential intraerythrocytic development cycle--the part life cycle 
that produces clinical manifestation malaria. severe impediment 
to progress phenotype wish study exactly one 
elusive. absence utilitarian way conditionally delete essential 
genes, prevented investigating parasite's vulnerable points.
this review aims focus development tools identifying essential genes
of p. falciparum ability elicit phenotypic mutation.
