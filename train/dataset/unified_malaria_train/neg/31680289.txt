the complexity plasmodium parasite life cycle poses challenge to
our understanding host immune response malaria. studying human
immune responses natural experimental plasmodium infections can
enhance understanding malaria-protective immunity inform design of
disease-modifying adjunctive therapies next-generation malaria vaccines.
systems immunology complement conventional approaches facilitate our
understanding complex immune response highly dynamic malaria
parasite. review, recent studies used systems-based approaches to
evaluate human immune responses natural experimental plasmodium
