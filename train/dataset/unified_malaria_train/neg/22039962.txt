background: aim study consider impact multi-clone,
complex infections parasite population structure low transmission 
setting. general, complexity infection (minimum number clones within 
infection) overall population level diversity expected minimal
in low transmission settings. additionally, parasite population structure 
predicted clonal, rather sexual due infrequent parasite inoculation
and lack recombination genetically distinct clones. however, this
low transmission peruvian amazon, complex infections becoming more
frequent, spite decreasing infection prevalence. study, was
hypothesized sexual recombination distinct clonal lineages of
plasmodium falciparum parasites altering subpopulation structure and
effectively maintaining population-level diversity.
methods: fourteen microsatellite markers chosen describe genetic
diversity 313 naturally occurring p. falciparum infections peruvian
amazon. population subpopulation structure characterized by
measuring: clusteredness, expected heterozygosity (he), allelic richness, private
allelic richness, linkage disequilibrium. next, microsatellite haplotypes and
alleles correlated p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 block 2
(pfmsp1-b2) examine presence recombinant microsatellite haplotypes.
results: parasite population structure consists six genetically diverse
subpopulations clones, called "clusters". clusters 1, 3, 4, 6 unique 
haplotypes exceed 70% total number clones within cluster,
while clusters 2 5 lower proportion unique haplotypes, still
exceed 46%. measuring he, allelic richness, private allelic richness
within six subpopulations, relatively low levels genetic diversity
within subpopulation (except cluster 4) observed. indicated that
the number alleles, combination alleles, limited. next, the
standard index association (ias) measured, revealed significant
decay linkage disequilibrium (ld) associated cluster 6, is
indicative independent assortment alleles. decay ld signature 
of subpopulation approaching linkage equilibrium undergoing sexual
recombination. trace possible recombination events, two frequent
microsatellite haplotypes observed time (defined either k1 mad20)
were selected progenitors potential recombinants identified 
in within natural population.
conclusions: contrary conventional low transmission models, study
provides evidence parasite population structure superficially
defined clonal backbone. sexual recombination occur even arguably
is responsible maintaining substructure population.
