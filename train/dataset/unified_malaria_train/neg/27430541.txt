chloroquine (cq) remains first-line treatment malaria haiti. given 
challenges conducting vivo drug efficacy trials low-endemic settings
like haiti, molecular surveillance drug resistance markers reasonable
approach detecting resistant parasites. study, 349 blood spots were
collected suspected malaria cases areas around port-au-prince from
march july 2010. among them, 121 samples plasmodium falciparum
positive polymerase chain reaction genotyped drug-resistant pfcrt,
pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1 alleles. among 108 samples successfully 
sequenced cq resistant markers pfcrt, 107 wild type (cvmnk), whereas 
one sample carried cq-resistant allele (cviet). neutral microsatellite
genotyping revealed cq-resistant isolate distinct other
samples study. furthermore, remaining parasite specimens appeared 
be genetically distinct reported central south american
populations.
