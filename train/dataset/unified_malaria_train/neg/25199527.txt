background: micrornas (mirnas) shown present plasma, are
remarkably stable, suggested disease biomarkers. toxoplasma
gondii (t. gondii) protozoan parasite infective wide range of
animals human beings. previous studies found parasite generated
a large number mirnas proliferation known spectrum
of mirna expression infected hosts pathogen-specific. date, there
are reports regarding application micrornas biomarkers early
detection t. gondii infection.
methods: study, investigated expression patterns 414 murine
mirnas tested expression levels plasma t. gondii infection
by real-time pcr, ultimate purpose identifying infection-related
mirnas. three mirnas particular, exhibiting prominently elevated expressions, 
were validated large number infected mice. toxoplasma
infection-specific mirnas confirmed comparing expression levels
with mice infected plasmodium berghei, p. yoelii, p. chabaudi,
cryptosporidium parvum, mouse hepatitis virus, staphylococcus aureus.
results: among 414 mirna candidates identified real-time pcr array, 71
were found up-regulated plasma t. gondii infected mice. three 
those mirnas (mmu-mir-712-3p, mmu-mir-511-5p mmu-mir-217-5p) prominently
expressed mice infected rh me49 strains t. gondii.
additionally, elevated expression mirnas toxoplasma-specific.
conclusions: levels three mirnas, mmu-mir-712-3p, mmu-mir-511-5p and
mmu-mir-217-5p mirnas, found specifically up-regulated plasma mice
after t. gondii infection.
