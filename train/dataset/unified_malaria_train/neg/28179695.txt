objective: establish polymerase chain reaction method based 18s ribosomal
ribonucleic acid gene detection plasmodium deoxyribonucleic acid in
patients suffering malaria symptoms.
methods: cross-sectional study conducted september 2013 october 
2014 district quetta pakistan's balochistan province. blood samples were
collected patients suffering general symptoms malaria. polymerase 
chain reaction-based technique applied diagnosis malaria and
detection responsible species patients suspected carry 
parasite. performance polymerase chain reaction method compared
against microscopy results. parasite number also calculated for
microscopy positive samples.all samples genomic deoxyribonucleic acid
isolation subjected polymerase chain reaction amplification agarose
gel electrophoresis.
results: 200 samples, 114(57%) confirmed positive 86(43%) as
negative malaria microscopy. polymerase chain reaction identified 124(62%)
samples positive 76(38%) negative malaria. comparative analysis
of diagnostic methods confirmed 109(54.5%) samples positive both
techniques. besides, 5(6.58%) samples identified false positive and
15(12.1%) samples false negative polymerase chain reaction. sensitivity,
specificity positive predictive values polymerase chain reaction in
comparison microscopy 87.98%, 93.42% 96%, respectively.
conclusions: polymerase chain reaction-based methods malaria diagnosis and
species identification found effective techniques.
