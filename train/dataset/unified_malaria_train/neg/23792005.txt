host cell invasion apicomplexan parasites driven gliding motility and
empowered actin-based movement essential parasite survival and
pathogenicity. parasites share conserved invasion process: actin-based
motility led coordination adhesin-cytoskeleton via aldolase. number
of studies host cell invasion plasmodium species toxoplasma gondii 
have performed. however, mechanisms host cell invasion babesia
species yet studied. here, show babesia gibsoni aldolase
(bgald) forms complex b. gibsoni thrombospondin-related anonymous protein 
(bgtrap) b. gibsoni actin (bgact), depending tryptophan-734 (w-734) in
bgtrap. addition, actin polymerization mediated bgald. moreover,
cytochalasin d, disrupts actin polymerization, suppressed b. gibsoni
parasite growth inhibited host cell invasion parasites, indicating
that actin dynamics essential erythrocyte invasion b. gibsoni. this
study first molecular approach determine invasion mechanisms of
babesia species.
