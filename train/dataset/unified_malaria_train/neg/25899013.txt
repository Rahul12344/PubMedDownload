the implementation successful insecticide resistance management strategies for
malaria control currently hampered poor understanding fitness cost
of resistance mosquito populations, including mating competiveness. to
fill knowledge gap, coupled uncoupled anopheles gambiae s.l. males (all 
m form (anopheles coluzzii)) collected mating swarms burkina faso.
this multiple insecticide resistant population exhibited high 1014f kdr(r) allele
frequencies (>60%) rdl(r) (>80%) contrast ace-1(r) allele (<6%).
kdr heterozygote males likely mate homozygote resistant
(or=2.36; p<0.001), suggesting negative impact kdr an. coluzzii mating
ability. interestingly, heterozygote males also competitive than
homozygote susceptible (or=3.26; p=0.006), suggesting heterozygote advantage
effect. similarly, heterozygote rdl(r)/rdl(s) also likely mate 
homozygote-resistant males (or=2.58; p=0.007). furthermore, additive mating
disadvantage detected male homozygotes kdr/rdl-resistant alleles.
in contrast, fitness difference observed ace-1 mutation.
comparative microarray-based genome-wide transcription analysis revealed that
metabolic resistance significantly alter mating competitiveness of
male an. coluzzii mosquitoes. indeed, significant difference expression
levels observed main metabolic resistance genes, suggesting that
metabolic resistance limited impact male mating competiveness. in
addition, specific gene classes/go terms associated mating process were
detected including sensory perception peroxidase activity. detrimental
impact insecticide resistance mating competiveness observed suggests
that resistance management strategies insecticide rotation could help
reverse resistance, implemented early.
