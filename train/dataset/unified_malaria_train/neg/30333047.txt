genetic manipulation human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum is
needed explore pathogen biology evaluate antimalarial targets. is,
however, aggravated low transfection efficiency, paucity selectable
markers biased a/t-rich genome. various enabling technologies have
been introduced past two decades, facile broad-range modification of
essential genes remains challenging. recently devised new application the
bxb1 integrase strategy meet need intronic attb sequence
within gene interest. although attb silent without effect on
intron splicing protein translation function, allows efficient gene
modification minimal risk unwanted changes genomic sites. we
describe range applications new method well specific cases 
where preferred crispr-cas9 technologies. advantages and
limitations various strategies endogenous gene editing also discussed.
