baculovirus vectors (bvs) enable safe efficient gene delivery mammalian
cells useful wide range applications, including gene therapy 
in vivo analysis gene functions. previously developed bvs expressing
malaria sporozoite surface proteins targeting liver cells hepatocytes.
however, bvs known vulnerable complement attack efforts 
overcome inactivation based complement important. study, bvs
expressing complement regulatory proteins (crps) surfaces virions 
developed inhibit complement reactions. decay accelerating factor (daf;
cd55)-type bvs exhibited significantly higher complement resistance control 
bvs without crps hepg2 cells transduction, although transduction
efficacy daf-type bv low. contrast, cd46-daf-cd59 fusion type bvs
showed significantly higher transduction efficacy complement resistance 
both control daf-type bvs. daf-type cd46-daf-cd59 type bvs repressed
formation membrane attack complex, terminal product complement
reaction cascades, induced bvs. results suggest cd46-daf-cd59
fusion construct confers complement protection ability superior the
daf construct gene delivery complement active serum.
