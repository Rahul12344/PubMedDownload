previous studies geographic patterns species diversity avian malaria 
parasites others order haemosporida include avian
biodiversity hotspot madagascar. since data available avian
malaria parasites madagascar, conducted first known large-scale
molecular-based study investigate biodiversity. samples (1067) 55
bird species examined pcr method amplifying nearly whole
haemosporidian cytochrome b gene (1063 bp). parasite lineages found were
further characterized phylogenetically degree specialization was
determined newly introduced host diversity index (hd). results
demonstrate madagascar indeed represents biodiversity hotspot avian
malaria parasites detected 71 genetically distinct parasite lineages the
genera plasmodium haemoproteus. furthermore, using phylogenetic approach
and including sequence divergence suspect detected haemosporidian
lineages represent least 29 groups i.e. proposed species. presented
hd values parasite regarding host species, genus family strongly
support previous works demonstrating elastic host ranges avian
parsites order haemosporida. representatives avian parasite genera 
plasmodium leucocytozoon tend often generalists 
genus haemoproteus. however, demonstrated various examples, a
large overlap single parasite lineages frequently deviate rule.
