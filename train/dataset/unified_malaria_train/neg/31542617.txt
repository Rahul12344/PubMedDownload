background aims: usnea diﬀ ;racta vain. (u. diffracta) belonging usnea
genus, widely used folk medicine treatment ulcer, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, malaria on. however, antiatherogenic effect u.
diffracta yet reported. study aims investigate the
antiatherogenic effects ethanol extract u. diffracta mechanism.
method: high fat diet vd3 used establish atherosclerotic rat
model, 0.004 g/kg/d simvastatin positive control, fed 0.7, 1.4,
and 2.8 g/kg/d usnea ethanol extract 21 days. blood, liver, aorta 
samples rat collected last administration.
pharmacodynamic effects evaluated. inflammation related factors, the
gene expressions toll-like receptor 5 (tlr5), myeloid differentiating factor
88 (myd88), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) detected.
results conclusions: compared model group, simvastatin ethanol
extract u. diffracta significantly reduce serum levels triglyceride
(tg), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), ca2+, ast, alt, liver
contents total cholesterol (tc), tg, ai liver index, well as
significantly increase contents high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(hdl-c) serum liver (p < 0.01 p < 0.05). serum level ox-ldl
can significantly reduced simvastatin, low medium u. diffracta ethanol 
extract doses (p < 0.01). addition, simvastatin low dosage u. diffracta
ethanol extract significantly reduce liver content ldl-c (p < 0.01).
u. diffracta ethanol extract shows positive antiatherogenic effect.
furthermore, mechanism may related promoting expression serum
il-10 inhibition tlr5/nf-κb signaling pathway.
