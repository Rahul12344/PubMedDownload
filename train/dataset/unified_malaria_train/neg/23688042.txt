background: plasmodium vivax continues widely distributed malarial
parasite species tropical sub-tropical areas, causing high morbidity
indices around world. better understanding proteins used the
parasite invasion red blood cells required obtain an
effective vaccine disease. study describes characterizing the
p. vivax asparagine-rich protein (pvarp) examines antigenicity natural
infection.
methods: target gene study selected according previous in
silico analysis using profile hidden markov models identified p. vivax
proteins play possible role invasion. transcription arp gene 
the p. vivax vcg-1 strain evaluated rt-pcr. specific human antibodies
against pvarp used confirm protein expression western blot well 
its subcellular localization immunofluorescence. recognition recombinant
pvarp sera p. vivax-infected individuals evaluated elisa.
results: vcg-1 strain pvarp 281-residue-long molecule, encoded a
single exon n-terminal secretion signal, well tandem repeat
region. protein expressed mature schizonts located the
surface merozoites, apparent accumulation towards apical pole.
sera p. vivax-infected patients recognized recombinant, thereby
suggesting protein targeted immune response infection.
conclusions: study showed characterization pvarp its
antigenicity. assays orientated towards evaluating antigen's
functional importance parasite invasion carried out.
