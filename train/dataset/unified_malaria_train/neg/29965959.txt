the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum evolved unusual genome
structure. majority genome relatively stable, mutation rates
similar eukaryotic species. however, regions unstable 
high recombination rates, driving generation new immune evasion-associated
var genes. molecular factors controlling inconsistent stability this
genome known. studied roles two putative recq
helicases p. falciparum, pfblm pfwrn. pfwrn knocked down,
recombination rates increased four-fold, generating chromosomal abnormalities, 
high rate chimeric var genes many microindels, particularly known
'fragile sites'. first identification gene involved in
suppressing recombination maintaining genome stability plasmodium. by
contrast, change mutation rate appeared second recq helicase,
pfblm, mutated. transcriptional level, however, helicases
evidently modulate transcription large cohorts genes, several
hundred genes-including large proportion vars-showing deregulated expression
in recq mutant. aberrant processing stalled replication forks a
possible mechanism underlying elevated mutation rates assessed by
measuring dna replication dynamics recq mutant lines. replication forks
moved slowly stalled elevated rates mutants, confirming recq 
helicases required efficient dna replication. overall, work
identifies plasmodium recq helicases major players dna replication,
antigenic diversification genome stability lethal human malaria
parasite, important implications genome evolution pathogen.
