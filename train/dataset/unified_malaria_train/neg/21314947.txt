background: quinine still recommended effective therapy severe cases
of plasmodium falciparum malaria, parasite developed resistance to
the drug cases. investigations genetic basis quinine
resistance (qnr) suggest qnr complex involves several genes, with
either additive pairwise effect. results obtained assessing one 
of genes, plasmodial na+/h+ exchanger, pfnhe-1, found depend
upon geographic origin parasite strain. associations
identified made asian strains; contrast, african strains, 
influence pfnhe qnr apparent. however, recent study carried in
kenya show significant association pfnhe polymorphism qnr. as
genetic differences may exist across african continent, field data are
needed determine association exists african regions. the
present study, association pfnhe qnr investigated series of
isolates central africa.
methods: sequence analysis polymorphisms pfnhe-1 ms4760
microsatellite evaluation vitro quinine susceptibility (by isotopic
assay) conducted 74 p. falciparum isolates republic congo.
results: polymorphisms number dnnnd nhndnhnnddd repeats the
pfnhe-1 ms4760 microsatellite associated quinine susceptibility.
conclusions: polymorphism microsatellite ms4760 pfnhe-1 cannot
be used monitor quinine response regions republic congo,
where isolates came from. finding suggests exists genetic
background associated geographic area association prevent 
the use pfnhe molecular marker qnr. contribution pfnhe 
in vitro response quinine remains assessed regions, including
in countries different levels drug pressure.
