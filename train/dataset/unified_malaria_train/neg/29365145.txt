the genome plasmodium falciparum, causative agent malaria africa,
has extensively studied since first fully sequenced 2002. however,
many open questions remain, including understanding chromosomal context of
molecular evolutionary changes (e.g., relationship chromosome map and
phylogenetic conservation, patterns gene duplication, patterns of
selection). here, present phylochromomap, method generates a
phylogenomic map chromosomes custom-built bioinformatics pipeline.
using p. falciparum 3d7 model, analyze 2,116 genes homologs to
941 diverse eukaryotic, bacterial archaeal lineages. estimate level of
conservation along chromosomes based conservation across clades, identify 
"young" regions (i.e., recent fast evolving genes) are
enriched subtelomeric regions compared internal regions. also
demonstrate patterns molecular evolution paralogous genes differ
significantly depending location younger paralogs tend found in
subtelomeric regions whereas older paralogs enriched internal regions.
combining observations analyses synteny, demonstrate that
subtelomeric regions actively shuffled among chromosome ends, is
consistent hypothesis regions prone ectopic
recombination. also assess patterns selection comparing dn/ds ratios 
gene family members subtelomeric versus internal regions, include the
important antigenic gene family var. analyses illustrate highly dynamic
nature karyotype p. falciparum, provide method exploring
genome dynamics lineages.
