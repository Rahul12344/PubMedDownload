plasmodium falciparum, primary cause malaria, contains a
non-photosynthetic plastid called apicoplast. apicoplast exists most
members phylum apicomplexa genome along with
organelle-specific enzymes replication. dna polymerase found 
the apicoplast (appol) putatively acquired horizontal gene transfer
from bacteriophage classified atypical a-family polymerase. here, 
we present crystal structure resolution 2.9å. p. falciparum appol,
the first structural representative plastidic a-family polymerase, diverges 
from typical a-family members two three previously identified signature
motifs region implicated sequence. moreover, appol an
additional n-terminal subdomain, absence severely diminishes 3' 
to 5' exonuclease activity. compound known toxic plasmodium a
potent inhibitor appol, suggesting appol viable drug target. the
structure provides new insights structural diversity a-family
polymerases may facilitate structurally guided antimalarial drug design.
