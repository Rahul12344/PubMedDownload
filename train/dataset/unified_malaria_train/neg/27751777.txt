rhomboid proteins considered widespread membrane proteins
across forms life. superfamily comprises active intramembrane
serine proteases catalyze release factors membrane, a
eukaryotic subset non-catalytic members rhomboid architecture
supports deviating functions. although rhomboid discovered genetic studies
of insect development, rhomboid research broadened dramatically past
15 years; rhomboid enzymes best biophysically understood all
intramembrane proteases, considered promising therapeutic targets for
diseases ranging parasitic infections parkinsonian neurodegeneration.
perhaps rapid progress come catalytically inert rhomboid
proteins, regulate protein trafficking and/or function, their
prominence underscored clinical mutations. diverse collection of
advances mark excellent point review state vibrant area of
research, central questions answered, instead a
firm grip key areas established, field poised for
breakthroughs.
