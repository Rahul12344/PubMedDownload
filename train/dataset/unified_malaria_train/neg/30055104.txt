entamoeba histolytica one least understood protists terms taxa,
clone, kin discrimination/recognition ability. however, capacity tell 
apart self (clone/kin) different nonself (nonclone/nonkin) has
long demonstrated pathogenic eukaryotes like trypanosoma plasmodium, 
free-living social amebas (dictyostelium, polysphondylium), budding yeast
(saccharomyces), numerous bacteria archaea (prokaryotes). kin
discrimination/recognition explained inclusive fitness theory; is, 
the reproductive advantage genetically closely related organisms (kin) can
gain cooperating preferably one another (rather distantly
related unrelated individuals), minimizing antagonism competition with
kin, excluding genetic strangers (or cheaters = noncooperators benefit
from others' investments altruistic cooperation). review, rely on
the outcomes in vitro pairwise discrimination/recognition encounters between
seven entamoeba lineages discuss biological significance taxa, clone,
and kin discrimination/recognition range generalist specialist
species (close distantly related phylogenetically). focus our
discussion importance laboratory observations for
e. histolytica's life cycle, host infestation, implications features
of amebas' natural history human health (including mitigation of
amebiasis).
