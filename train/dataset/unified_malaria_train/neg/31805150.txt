plasmodium (p.) falciparum malaria pregnancy frequently
associated severe consequences maternal anemia, abortion, premature 
birth, reduced birth weight. placental damage promotes disruption the
local homeostasis; though, mechanisms underlying events still be
elucidated. autophagy fundamental homeostatic mechanism natural
course pregnancy cells self-recycle order survive stressful 
environments. placentas non-infected p. falciparum-infected women during
pregnancy selected previous prospective cohort study conducted the
brazilian amazon (acre, brazil). newborns infected women experienced reduced
birth weight (p = 0.0098) placental immunopathology markers monocyte 
infiltrate (p < 0.0001) il-10 production (p = 0.0122). placentas were
evaluated autophagy-related molecules. result, observed reduced mrna 
levels ulk1 (p = 0.0255), becn1 (p = 0.0019), map1lc3b (p = 0.0086) genes 
in placentas p. falciparum-infected, striking those
diagnosed placental malaria. despite protein levels genes
followed pattern, observed reduction statistically
significant placentas p. falciparum-infected women. nevertheless, our
data suggest chronic placental immunopathology due p. falciparum
infection leads autophagy dysregulation, might impair local homeostasis 
during malaria pregnancy may result poor pregnancy outcomes.
