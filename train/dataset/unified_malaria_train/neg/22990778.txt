real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), quantitative pcr (qpcr), a
rapid, sensitive, specific method used broad variety applications
including quantitative gene expression analysis, dna copy number measurement,
characterization gene chromosomal deletions, genotyping. real-time
reverse transcription (rt)-pcr largely supplanted northern blot rnase
protection assays, two examples, means quantifying transcript levels. 
the method utilizes small amounts rna allows efficient screening a
large number samples. here, describe materials methods required 
perform real-time rt-pcr, including rna purification, cdna synthesis, and
real-time pcr analysis cdna samples.
