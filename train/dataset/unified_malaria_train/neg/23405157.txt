anopheles sinensis important vector malaria southeast asia,
including china. currently, effective measure prevent malaria
transmission relies vector control use insecticides, primarily 
pyrethroids. extensive use insecticides poses strong selection pressure on
mosquito populations resistance. resistance insecticides arise due 
mutations insecticide target site (target site resistance), the
case pyrethroids para-type sodium channel gene, and/or catabolism
of insecticide detoxification enzymes reaches target
(metabolic detoxification resistance). study, examined deltamethrin
resistance an. sinensis china investigated relative importance of
target site versus metabolic detoxification mechanisms resistance. high
frequency (>85%) nonsynonymous mutations para gene found in
populations central china, populations southern china.
metabolic detoxification measured activity monooxygenases and
glutathione s-transferases (gsts) detected populations central
and southern china. monooxygenase activity levels significantly higher in
the resistant susceptible mosquitoes, independently geographic 
origin. stepwise multiple regression analyses mosquito populations from
central china found knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations and
monooxygenase activity significantly associated deltamethrin
resistance, monooxygenase activity playing stronger role. results
demonstrate importance metabolic detoxification pyrethroid resistance
in an. sinensis, suggest different mechanisms resistance could evolve
in geographically different populations.
