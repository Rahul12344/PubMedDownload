thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (trap) plasmodium vivax (p. vivax)
became one important vaccine candidates malaria, p. vivax trap
(pvtrap) responsible sporozoite-host interactions. pvtrap
polymorphisms isolates republic korea (rok) analysed, setting
the valuable baseline data future vaccine developments clinical
trials pvtrap, strong vaccine candidate. total 54 isolates were
collected 2010. pvtrap genes isolates amplified sequenced,
and results analysed compared sal-1 strain. sequencing
analysis 1424-bp-size pvtrap pcr products revealed one major allelic type with
six non-synonymous substitutions, s81t, e95d, i121v t127r substitutions
were found region ii, k371n a425e substitutions region iv. the
rok isolates revealed limited sequence polymorphisms pvtrap comparison 
with reported isolates nations.
