the rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei practical model organism 
experimental studies human malaria. plasmepsins class aspartic
proteinase isoforms exert multiple pathological effects malaria
parasites. plasmepsins residing food vacuole (fv) parasite
hydrolyze hemoglobin red blood cells. study, cloned pbpm4, fv
plasmepsin gene p. berghei encoded n-terminally truncated pro-segment 
and mature enzyme genomic dna. over-expressed pbpm4 zymogen as
inclusion bodies (ib) escherichia coli, purified protein following 
vitro ib refolding. auto-maturation pbpm4 zymogen mature enzyme was
carried ph 4.5, 5.0, 5.5. interestingly, found pbpm4
zymogen exhibited catalytic activity regardless presence the
pro-segment. determined optimal catalytic conditions pbpm4 studied
enzyme kinetics substrates inhibitors aspartic proteinases. using
combinatorial chemistry-based peptide libraries, studied active site
preferences pbpm4 subsites s1, s2, s3, s1', s2' s3'. based these
results, designed synthesized selective peptidomimetic compound and
tested inhibition pbpm4, seven fv plasmepsins human malaria
parasites, human cathepsin (hcatd). showed compound exhibited 
a >10-fold selectivity pbpm4 human malaria parasite plasmepsin 4 orthologs
versus hcatd. data study furthesr understanding enzymatic
characteristics plasmepsin family provides leads anti-malarial
drug design.
