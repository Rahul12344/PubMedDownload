intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(iptp-sp) key strategy control pregnancy-associated malaria.
however, strategy compromised widespread drug resistance from
single-nucleotide polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate
reductase dihydropteroate synthetase genes. september 2008-october
2010, monitored cohort 924 pregnant women area tanzania with
declining malaria transmission. p. falciparum parasites genotyped, the
effect infecting haplotypes birthweight assessed. genotyped
parasites, 9.3%, 46.3%, 44.4% quadruple less, quintuple, sextuple 
mutated haplotypes, respectively. mutant haplotypes unrelated sp doses.
compared infections less-mutated haplotypes, infections the
sextuple haplotype mutation associated lower (359 g) birthweights.
continued use suboptimal iptp-sp regimen reevaluated, and
alternative strategies (e.g., intermittent screening treatment or
intermittent treatment safe effective alternative drugs) be
evaluated.
