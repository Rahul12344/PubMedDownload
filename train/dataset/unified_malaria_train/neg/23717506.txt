background: three members plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-3
(pvmsp3) family (pvmsp3-α, pvmsp3-β pvmsp3-γ) initially characterized
and later shown part larger highly diverse family, encoded a
cluster genes arranged head-to-tail chromosome 10. pvmsp3-α pvmsp3-β
have become genetic markers epidemiological studies, evaluated
as vaccine candidates. research investigates gene protein expression
of entire family pertinent implications.
methodology/principal findings: 60 kb multigene locus chromosome 10 p. 
vivax (salvador 1 strain) studied classify number pvmsp3 genes
present, compare transcription, translation protein localization
patterns blood-stage development. eleven pvmsp3 paralogs encode an
n-terminal nlrng signature motif, central domain containing repeated variable
heptad sequences, conserved hydrophilic c-terminal features. one additional
orf locus lacks features excluded member family.
transcripts representing eleven pvmsp3 genes detected trophozoite-
and schizont-stage rna. quantitative immunoblots using schizont-stage extracts
and antibodies specific pvmsp3 protein demonstrated but
pvmsp3.11 could detected. homologs also detected immunoblot the
closely related simian species, p. cynomolgi p. knowlesi. immunofluorescence 
assays confirmed eight pvmsp3s present mature schizonts.
uniquely, pvmsp3.7 expressed exclusively apical end merozoites.
conclusion/significance: specific proteins detected representing the
expression 10 11 genes confirmed members pvmsp3 family. eight
pvmsp3s visualized surrounding merozoites. contrast, pvmsp3.7 was
detected apical end merozoites. pvmsp3.11 transcripts present,
though corresponding protein detected. pvmsp3 functions remain unknown.
the ten expressed pvmsp3s predicted unique complementary
functions merozoite biology.
