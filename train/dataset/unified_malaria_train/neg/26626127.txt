background: currently standardized approach assessing vitro
anti-malarial drug susceptibility. potential alterations drug susceptibility
results fresh immediate ex vivo (iev) cryopreserved culture-adapted
(cca) plasmodium falciparum isolates, well changes parasite genotype
during culture adaptation investigated.
methods: 50 % inhibitory concentration (ic50) 12 p. falciparum isolates
from cambodia panel commonly used drugs compared using iev
and cca. results compared using histidine-rich protein-2 elisa (hrp-2) 
and sybr-green fluorescence methods. molecular genotyping amplicon deep
sequencing also used compare multiplicity infection genetic
polymophisms fresh versus culture-adapted isolates.
results: ic50 culture-adapted specimens significantly lower compared 
the original fresh isolates hrp-2 sybr-green assays, greater 
than 50 % decline majority drug-assay combinations. were
correlations ic50s iev cca drugs assays. infections
were nearly monoclonal, little change merozoite surface protein
1 (msp1), msp2, glutamate-rich protein (glurp) apical membrane antigen 1
(ama1) polymorphisms, differences p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1
gene (pfmdr1) copy number single nucleotide polymorphisms following culture
adaptation.
conclusions: overall ic50 reduction combined correlation between
fresh isolates culture-adapted drug susceptibility assays suggests the
utility approaches, long consistency method, and
remaining mindful possible attenuation resistance phenotype occurring in
culture. study done higher transmission settings where
polyclonal infections prevalent.
