summary: homing endonuclease genes (hegs) exist naturally many single-celled
organisms show extremely strong genetic drive allowing spread
through populations introduced. investigated
as tools manipulate populations important vectors human disease, 
particular mosquitoes transmit malaria. hegs deployed, 
is important study spatial spread order design efficient release
strategies.a spatially explicit model developed study spread heg
through landscape whose structure defined distribution mosquito
breeding feeding sites. model motivated biology major
vectors malaria africa. conditions spread, fixation loss two
major types heg explored different landscapes.in landscapes where
mosquito resources abundant, conditions spread well approximated 
by mean-field model. heg imposes genetic load, cause
population extinction, though spatial models often predict population
suppression.in certain types landscapes mosquito resources rare, 
introduced heg may prevented moving local mosquito populations
and simple release strategy unlikely effective, yet heg
succeeds spreading population extinction feasible outcome. increasing the
number release sites expense releasing fewer mosquitoes per site
reduces probability heg fail.synthesis applications. the
model presented asks first time spatial structure mosquito
populations influence effectiveness technology being
rapidly developed vector control. homing endonuclease genes (hegs) 
be used way, qualified importance accounting landscape
characteristics execution expectation application.
the next stage use model study spread hegs real
landscapes releases may take place, something facilitated by
the results present study.
