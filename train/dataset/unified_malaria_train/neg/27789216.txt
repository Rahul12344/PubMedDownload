bone lytic diseases including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone
metastatic tumors affect hundreds millions people worldwide. targeting
over-activated osteoclasts anti-resorptive treatment becomes important
strategy treat osteolytic diseases. artesunate compound derived from
artemisinin (qinghaosu) used treat malaria rheumatoid
arthritis clinically china, role osteolysis unknown. here, we
found artesunate could suppress rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis bone
resorption 1.56 12.5μm. artesunate obviously reduced rankl-induced
nf-κb-luc activity 50μm, effects rankl-induced nf-κb activation 
(nf-κb luciferase activity, iκb-α degradation nuclear nf-κb p65 protein
level) 3.125 12.5μm pre-osteoclastic raw264.7 cells. interestingly,
artesunate could significantly inhibit rankl-induced nfatc1 activation measured
by nfat luciferase activity, nfatc1 mrna nuclear nfatc1 protein levels from
3.125 12.5μm. study revealed artesunate inhibited rankl
up-regulated plcγ1 activation, intracellular calcium, calcineurin (pp2b-aα)
protein expression 3.125 12.5μm. addition, nfatc1 targeted
osteoclast-specific genes expression including cathepsin k, mmp-9, trap was
reduced artesunate. finally, showed artesunate able reverse the
bone loss ovariectomized mouse model vivo accompanied reduced
rankl, rankl/opg, trap-5b levels. study indicates artesunate
inhibits rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis bone loss inhibiting
plcγ1-ca2+-calcineurin-nfatc1 pathway. collectively, data suggest that
artesunate potential treatment option rankl-mediated osteolytic bone
disease.
