plasmodium falciparum responsible severe form malaria in
humans. antigenic variation p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 leads
to immune evasion occurs switches mutually exclusive var gene
transcription. recent progress plasmodium epigenetics notwithstanding, the
mechanisms singularity var activation achieved unknown. here, 
we employed functional approach dissect role var gene upstream
regions mutually exclusive activation. besides identifying sequence elements
involved activation initiation transcription, mapped region
downstream transcriptional start site required maintain
singular var gene choice. activation promoters lacking sequence occurs no
longer competition endogenous var genes. within region pinpointed
a sequence-specific dna-protein interaction involving cis-acting sequence motif
that conserved majority var loci. results suggest important
role interaction mutually exclusive locus recognition. findings
are furthermore consistent novel mechanism control singular
gene choice eukaryotes. addition importance p. falciparum
antigenic variation, results may also help explain similar processes in
other systems.
