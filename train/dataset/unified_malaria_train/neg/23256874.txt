aims: chloroquine (cq) kills plasmodium falciparum binding heme, preventing
its detoxification hemozoin digestive vacuole (dv) parasite. cq 
resistance (cqr) associated mutations dv membrane protein p.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), mediating leakage of
cq dv. however, additional factors thought contribute the
resistance phenotype. study tested hypothesis link
between glutathione (gsh) cqr.
results: using isogenic parasite lines carrying wild-type mutant pfcrt, we
reveal lower levels gsh mutant lines enhanced sensitivity the
gsh synthesis inhibitor l-buthionine sulfoximine, without alteration in
cytosolic de novo gsh synthesis. incubation n-acetylcysteine resulted in
increased gsh levels parasites, reduced susceptibility cq in
pfcrt mutant-expressing lines. support heme destruction mechanism
involving gsh cqr parasites, also found lower hemozoin levels reduced
cq binding cqr pfcrt-mutant lines. demonstrate via expression
in xenopus laevis oocytes mutant alleles pfcrt cqr parasites
selectively transport gsh.
innovation: propose mechanism whereby mutant pfcrt allows enhanced transport
of gsh parasite's dv. elevated levels gsh dv reduce the
level free heme available cq binding, mediates lower
susceptibility cq pfcrt mutant parasites.
conclusion: pfcrt dual role cqr, facilitating efflux harmful cq 
from dv influx beneficial gsh dv.
