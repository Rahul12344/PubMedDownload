larval adult mosquitoes mount immune responses pathogens invade 
their hemocoel. although suggested correlation exists 
immune processes across insect life stages, influence infection in
the hemocoel larva immune system eclosed adult remains
unknown. here, used anopheles gambiae test whether larval infection
influences adult response subsequent bacterial malaria parasite
infection. found female male mosquitoes, larval infection 
enhances efficiency bacterial clearance following secondary infection in
the hemocoel adults. adults emerge infected larvae more
hemocytes adults emerge naive injured larvae, individual
hemocytes greater phagocytic activity. furthermore, mrna abundance immune
genes-such cecropin a, lysozyme c1, stat-a, tep1-is higher adults 
emerge infected larvae. larval infection, however, a
meaningful effect probability female adults survive systemic
bacterial infection, increases susceptibility females plasmodium
yoelii, measured oocyst prevalence intensity midgut. finally,
immune proficiency varies sex; females exhibit increased bacterial killing,
have twice many hemocytes, highly express immune genes. together,
these results show larval hemocoelic infection induces transstadial immune
activation-possibly via transstadial immune priming-but confers both
costs benefits emerged adults.
