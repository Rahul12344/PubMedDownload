background: growing evidence widespread use long-lasting
insecticidal nets (llins) prompting malaria vectors shift biting
towards times places people protected, earlier the
evening and/or outdoors. uncertain whether behavioural shifts due
to phenotypic plasticity and/or ecological changes within vector communities that
favour exophilic species, involve genetic factors within vector species
to limit contact llins. possibly variation time location of
mosquito biting genetic basis, yet phenomenon received
little investigation. used candidate gene approach investigate
whether polymorphisms selected circadian clock genes could explain variation
in time location feeding (indoors versus outside) within natural
population major african malaria vector anopheles arabiensis.
methods: host-seeking an. arabiensis collected two villages (lupiro and
sagamaganga) tanzania human landing catch (hlc) technique. mosquitoes 
classified phenotypes "early" (7 pm-10 pm) "late" biting (4 -7 am),
and host-seeking indoors outdoors. samples genotyped 34 coding
snps 8 clock genes (per, tim, clk, cyc, pdp1, vri, cry1, cry2), tested
for associations snps biting phenotypes. snps 8
mitochondrial genes (atp6, atp8, cox1, cox2, cox3, nd3, nd5 cytb) also
genotyped test population subdivision within an. arabiensis.
results: candidate clock genes exhibited polymorphism within an. arabiensis, 
but unrelated variation timing location biting
activity. however, evidence strong genetic structure within an.
arabiensis populations association tim, unrelated to
geographic distance. substructure within an. arabiensis also detected using
mitochondrial markers.
conclusions: variable timing location biting an. arabiensis could
not linked candidate clock genes known influence behaviour in
other diptera. finding rule possibility genetic basis 
to biting behaviour malaria vector, suggests complex
phenotypes require intensive ecological, neuronal genomic analyses 
to understand.
