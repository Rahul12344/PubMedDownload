nucleotide excision repair (ner) one dna repair pathways crucial for
maintenance genome integrity deals repair dna damages arising due 
to exogenous endogenous factors. multi-protein transcription initiation
factor tfiih plays critical role ner transcription highly
conserved throughout evolution. malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum has
been challenge researchers long time emergence drug
resistance. availability genome sequence opened new avenues for
research. antimalarial drugs like chloroquine mefloquine reported
to inhibit ner pathway mediated repair reactions thus promote mutagenesis.
previous studies validated existence implied possible association of
defective altered dna repair pathways development drug resistant
phenotype certain p. falciparum strains. conjecture compromised ner 
pathway combination dna repair pathways might conducive 
emergence sustenance drug resistance p. falciparum. therefore we
decided unravel components ner pathway p. falciparum using
bioinformatics based approaches report genome wide silico analysis
of ner components p. falciparum comparison human host.
our results reveal p. falciparum genome contains almost components
of ner unable find clear homologue p62 xpc genome. 
the structure modeling components suggests their
structures significantly conserved. furthermore study lays foundation 
to perform similar comparative studies drug resistant drug sensitive 
strains parasite order understand dna repair-related mechanisms drug 
resistance.
