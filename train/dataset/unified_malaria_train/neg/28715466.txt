antenna main chemosensory organ mosquitoes. characterization the
transcriptional changes blood meal, especially related to
chemoreception, may help explain mosquito blood sucking behavior to
identify novel targets mosquito control. anopheles sinensis asiatic
mosquito species transmits malaria lymphatic filariasis. however,
studies chemosensory biology female an. sinensis quite lacking. we
report transcriptome analysis an. sinensis female antennae pre- post-
blood meal. created six an. sinensis antenna rna-seq libraries, three from
females without blood meal three females five hours blood meal. 
illumina sequencing conducted analyze transcriptome differences
between two groups. total, sequenced fragments created 21,643 genes,
1,828 novel. 12,861 genes considered expressed
(fpkm >1.0) least one two groups, 12,159 genes expressed in
both groups. 548 genes differentially expressed blood-fed group, with
331 genes up-regulated 217 genes down-regulated. go enrichment analysis of
the differentially expressed genes suggested statistically
over represented go terms among down-regulated genes blood-fed mosquitoes,
while enriched go terms up-regulated genes occurred mainly in
metabolic process. chemosensory gene families, subtle distinction in
the expression levels observed according statistical analysis.
however, firstly comprehensive identification chemosensory gene
families an. sinensis antennae help characterize precise function 
of proteins odor recognition mosquitoes. study provides first 
global view changes transcript accumulation elicited blood meal in
an. sinensis female antennae.
