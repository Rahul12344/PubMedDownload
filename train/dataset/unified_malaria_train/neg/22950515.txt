background: malaria remains major cause morbidity mortality worldwide.
flow cytometry-based assays take advantage fluorescent protein
(fp)-expressing malaria parasites proven valuable tools for
quantification sorting specific subpopulations parasite-infected red
blood cells. however, identification rare subpopulations parasites using
green fluorescent protein (gfp) labelling complicated autofluorescence (af)
of red blood cells low signal transgenic parasites. been
suggested cell sorting yield could improved using filters that
precisely match emission spectrum gfp.
methods: detection transgenic plasmodium falciparum parasites expressing
either tdtomato gfp performed using flow cytometer interchangeable 
optical filters. parasitaemia evaluated using different optical filters and, 
after optimization optics, gfp-expressing parasites sorted and
analysed microscopy cytospin preparation imaging cytometry.
results: new approach evaluate filter performance flow cytometry using
two-dimensional dot blot developed. selecting optical filters narrow 
bandpass (bp) maximum position filter emission close gfp maximum
emission fl1 channel (510/20, 512/20 517/20; dichroics 502lp and
466lp), af markedly decreased signal-background improve dramatically.
sorting gfp-expressing parasite populations infected red blood cells 90 
or 95% purity filters resulted 50-150% increased yield when
compared standard filter set-up. purity sorted population was
confirmed using imaging cytometry microscopy cytospin preparations of
sorted red blood cells infected transgenic malaria parasites.
discussion: filter optimization particularly important applications 
the fp signal percentage positive events relatively low, as
analysis parasite-infected samples intention gene-expression
profiling analysis. approach outlined results substantially
improved yield gfp-expressing parasites, requires decreased sorting time
in comparison standard methods. anticipated protocol be
useful wide range applications involving rare events.
