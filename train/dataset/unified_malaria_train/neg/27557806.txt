background: haplotypes important anti-malarial drug resistance because
genes encoding drug resistance may accumulate mutations several codons 
same gene, mutation increasing level drug resistance and, possibly,
reducing metabolic costs previous mutation. patients often two or
more haplotypes blood sample may make impossible identify
exactly haplotypes carry, hence measure type frequency 
of resistant haplotypes malaria population.
results: study presents two novel statistical methods
expectation-maximization (em) markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) algorithms to
investigate issue. performance algorithms evaluated on
simulated datasets consisting patient blood characterized their
multiplicity infection (moi) malaria genotype. datasets generated 
using different resistance allele frequencies (raf) single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) different limit detection (lod) snps the
moi. em mcmc algorithm validated appear accurate, faster
and slightly less affected lod snps moi compared previous
related statistical approaches.
conclusions: em mcmc algorithms perform well analysing malaria
genetic data obtained infected human blood samples. results robust
to genotyping errors caused lods function well even absence moi 
data individual patients.
