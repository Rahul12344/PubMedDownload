background: saccharomyces cerevisiae, engineered l-lactic acid production
from glucose xylose, promising production host for
lignocellulose-to-lactic acid processes. however, two principal engineering
strategies-pyruvate-to-lactic acid conversion without disruption 
competing pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway-have yet resulted strains that
combine high lactic acid yields (yla) productivities (qla) sugar
substrates. limitations seemingly arise dependency carbon source
and aeration conditions, underlying effects poorly understood. we
have recently presented two xylose-to-lactic acid converting strains, ibb14la1
and ibb14la1_5, l-lactic acid dehydrogenase plasmodium
falciparum (pfldh) integrated pdc1 (pyruvate decarboxylase) locus.
ibb14la1_5 additionally pdc5 gene knocked out. study, the
influence carbon source oxygen yla qla ibb14la1 ibb14la1_5
was investigated.
results: anaerobic fermentation ibb14la1 showed higher yla xylose
(0.27 g g xyl-1 ) glucose (0.18 g g glc-1 ). ethanol yields (yetoh,
0.15 g g xyl-1 0.32 g g glc-1 ) followed opposite trend. ibb14la1_5,
the effect carbon source yla less pronounced (~ 0.80 g g xyl-1 ,
and 0.67 g g glc-1 ). supply oxygen accelerated glucose conversions
significantly ibb14la1 (qla 0.38 0.81 g l-1 h-1) ibb14la1_5 (qla
from 0.05 1.77 g l-1 h-1) constant yla (ibb14la1 ~ 0.18 g g glc-1 ;
ibb14la1_5 ~ 0.68 g g glc-1 ). aerobic xylose conversions, however, lactic
acid production ceased completely ibb14la1 decreased drastically in
ibb14la1_5 (yla aerobic ≤ 0.25 g g xyl-1 anaerobic ~ 0.80 g g xyl-1 ) at
similar qla (~ 0.04 g l-1 h-1). switching aerobic microaerophilic
conditions (po2 ~ 2%) prevented lactic acid metabolization, observed fully
aerobic conditions, increased qla yla 0.11 g l-1 h-1 0.38 g g
xyl-1 , respectively. pfldh pdc activities ibb14la1 measured 
shown change drastically dependent carbon source oxygen.
conclusion: evidence conversion time courses together results of
activity measurements pfldh pdc show ibb14la1 distribution of
fluxes pyruvate branching point carbon source oxygen dependent.
comparison performance strain ibb14la1 ibb14la1_5 conversions
under different aeration conditions (aerobic, anaerobic, microaerophilic)
further suggest xylose, unlike glucose, repress respiratory
response strains. study proposes new genetic engineering targets for
rendering genetically engineering s. cerevisiae better suited lactic acid
biorefineries.
