malaria one devastating tropical parasite infectious
diseases popular around world. severe malaria characterized multiple
organ dysfunctions, especially liver damage. however, mechanisms malarial 
liver injury remain better clarified. study, kunming mice
inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) 10(6) plasmodium berghei anka
(pbanka)-infected red blood cells (irbcs) investigated days 5, 10, 15,
and 20 post-infection (p.i.) elucidate profiles t-cell immunoglobulin
and mucin domain-3 (tim-3) ligand galecin-9 (gal-9) development of
liver injury. histopathology livers spleens pbanka-infected mice 
were observed, parasite burdens livers spleens using quantitative 
real-time pcr (qrt-pcr), tim-3- gal-9-positive cells livers and
spleens using immunohistochemical staining, mrna levels tim-3, gal-9, 
and cytokines livers spleens using qrt-pcr examined. our
results showed parasite burdens livers spleens significantly
increased time pbanka infection. histological scores liver
and spleen tissues significantly increased time; numbers tim-3- 
and gal-9-positive cells significantly increased livers and
spleens using immunohistochemical staining, mrna levels tim-3 and
gal-9 livers spleens also significantly increased after
infection. data suggests increase tim-3/gal-9 expressions may
play important role liver damage p. berghei infection.
