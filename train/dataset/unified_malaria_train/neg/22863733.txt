we sequenced annotated genomes four p. vivax strains collected from
disparate geographic locations, tripling number genome sequences available
for understudied parasite providing first genome-wide perspective of
global variability species. observe approximately twice much snp
diversity among isolates among comparable collection isolates
of p. falciparum, malaria-causing parasite results higher mortality.
this indicates distinct history global colonization and/or stable
demographic history p. vivax relative p. falciparum, thought to
have undergone recent population bottleneck. snp diversity, well as
additional microsatellite gene family variability, suggests capacity for
greater functional variation global population p. vivax. findings
warrant deeper survey variation p. vivax equip disease interventions
targeting distinctive biology neglected major pathogen.
