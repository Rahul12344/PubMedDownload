forty-three 120 (35.8%) clarias garipenus fish found naturally 
infected henneguya suprabanchiae. infection appeared clusters of
ovoid ellipsoidal plasmodia embedded within hyaline cartilage the
suprabranchial organ fish. histological studies indicate tissue distortion
at sites infection. continuous growth plasmodium led to
deformation filament structure well disorganization displacement
of gill lamellae. also, severe atrophy occurred hyaline cartilage of
the gills also gill lamellae. based structure measurements 
of fresh spores light microscopy, parasite identified h.
suprabranchiae. spores oval shape, measure 13 (11-14) × 3 (2-5)
μm length width. two polar capsules inside, measures 3 (2.5-5) × 1
(1.5-4) μm length width. polar capsule spirally coiled (7-9 turns) 
polar filament. ultrastructural analysis showed plasmodia were
surrounded single-unit membrane. generative cells early
developmental stages arranged periphery plasmodia, while
immature mature spores centrally arranged. developmental stages
characterizing sporogenesis, capsulogenisis, valvogenesis present
parasite ultrastructurally studied. small subunit 18 rdna (ssu rdna)
gene sequences different isolates sequenced compared the
sequence gene henneguya sp. isolated genbank. the
phylogenetic position present henneguya sp. within genus was
determined using sequence analysis related taxa available genbank, 
the phylogenetic tree derived study elucidated compared the
current taxonomy available myxosporeans. comparison nucleotide
sequences divergence showed ssu rdna gene henneguya species 
revealed 92.2% sequence identity henneguya exilis (acc. no. af021881)
differing 30 nucleotides lower divergence value.
