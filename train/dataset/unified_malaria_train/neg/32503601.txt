background: sugar-feeding provides energy mosquitoes. facilitated glucose
transporters (gluts) responsible uptake glucose animals.
however, knowledge gluts function anopheles spp. limited.
methods: phylogenetic analysis gluts anopheles stephensi performed by
the maximum likelihood bayesian inference methods. spatial temporal
expression patterns four asteglut genes analyzed qpcr. function of
asteglut1 examined using dsrna-mediated rna interference method.
transcriptome analysis used investigate global influence asteglut1 
on mosquito physiology.
results: identified 4 glut genes, asteglut1, asteglutx, asteglut3 and
asteglut4 an. stephensi. asteglut1, asteglut3 asteglut4 mainly
expressed midgut. plasmodium berghei infection differentially regulated
the expression asteglut genes significant downregulation asteglut1 and
asteglut4, upregulation asteglutx. knocking-down asteglut1
facilitated plasmodium berghei infection an. stephensi. might due to
the accumulation glucose prior blood-feeding dsasteglut1-treated
mosquitoes. transcriptome analysis revealed knockdown asteglut1
differentially regulated expression genes associated multiple functional 
clusters, especially related detoxification immunity. the
dysregulation multiple pathways might contribute increased p. berghei
infection.
conclusions: study shows asteglut1 participates defense p.
berghei an. stephensi. regulation asteglut1 vector competence might 
through modulating multiple biological processes, detoxification and
immunity.
