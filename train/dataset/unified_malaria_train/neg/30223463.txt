to evaluate whether recovery complicated malaria follows common trajectory
in terms immunological mechanism or, rather, highly individualized each
patient, performed longitudinal gene expression profiling whole blood. rna 
sequencing (rnaseq) performed blood samples obtained eight patients
on four consecutive days hospital admission discharge. six patients
were infected plasmodium falciparum, two plasmodium vivax; one
patient pregnant woman infected p. falciparum, hospitalized
for several weeks. characterization blood transcript modules (btm) and
blood informative transcripts (bit) revealed patients' responses showed
little commonality, dominated balance gene activity relating to
lymphocyte function, inflammation, interferon responses specific each
patient. weak correlations specific complicated malaria symptoms such
as jaundice, thrombocytopenia, anemia observed. differential
expression individual genes, including transcripts derived human
leukocyte antigen (hla) complex, generally reflected differences the
underlying immune processes. although results pilot study not
point single process might provide target complicated malaria
treatment prevention personalized medical strategies, larger patient series
and extensive blood sampling may allow classification patients
according type response order develop novel therapeutic
approaches.
