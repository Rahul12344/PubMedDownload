background: malaria parasites genus plasmodium complicated
life cycle involving invertebrate vector vertebrate host. rna-binding
proteins (rbps) critical factors involved every aspect development 
of parasites. however, rbps functionally characterized
to date human parasite plasmodium falciparum.
methods: using different bioinformatic methods tools searched p.
falciparum genome list annotate rbps. representative 3d models 
of rbd domain identified p. falciparum created using i-tessar and
swiss-model. microarray rnaseq data analysis pertaining pfrbps performed 
using mev software. finally, cytoscape used create protein-protein
interaction network cith-dozi caf1-ccr4-not complexes.
results: report identification 189 putative rbp genes belonging 13
different families plasmodium, comprise 3.5% annotated genes.
almost 90% (169/189) genes belong six prominent rbp classes, namely
rna recognition motifs, dead/h-box rna helicases, k homology, zinc finger, puf
and alba gene families. interestingly, almost identified rna-binding
helicases kh genes cognate homologs model species, suggesting their
evolutionary conservation. exploration existing p. falciparum blood-stage 
transcriptomes revealed rbps peak mrna expression levels early
during intraerythrocytic development cycle, taper later stages. 
nearly 27% rbps elevated expression gametocytes, 47 24% have
elevated mrna expression ookinete asexual stages. comparative interactome 
analyses using human plasmodium protein-protein interaction datasets suggest 
extensive conservation pfcith/pfdozi pfcaf1-ccr4-not complexes.
conclusions: plasmodium parasites possess large number putative rbps
belonging rbp families identified far, suggesting presence of
extensive post-transcriptional regulation parasites. taken together, 
silico identification putative rbps provides foundation future
functional studies aimed defining unique network post-transcriptional
regulation p. falciparum.
