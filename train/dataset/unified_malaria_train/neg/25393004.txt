the glideosome actomyosin-based machinery powers motility in
apicomplexa participates host cell invasion egress infected
cells. central component glideosome, myosin (myoa), motor
recruited pellicle acylated gliding-associated protein gap45. in
toxoplasma gondii, gap45 also contributes cohesion pellicle,
composed inner membrane complex (imc) plasma membrane, during
motor traction. gap70 previously identified paralog gap45 is
tailored recruit myoa apical cap coccidian subgroup the
apicomplexa. third member family, gap80, demonstrated to
assemble new glideosome, recruits class xiv myosin c (myoc) the
basal polar ring. myoc shares myosin light chains myoa also
interacts integral imc proteins gap50 gap40. moreover, central
component complex, imc-associated protein 1 (iap1), acts key
determinant restricted localization myoc posterior pole.
deletion specific components myoc-glideosome underscores the
installation compensatory mechanisms components myoa-glideosome.
conversely, removal myoa leads relocalization myoc along the
pellicle apical cap accounts residual invasion. two
glideosomes exhibit considerable level plasticity ensure parasite
survival.
