animal species able acquire new genetic material via hybridization and
subsequent introgression. however, little known foreign genomic
material incorporated population time genes are
susceptible introgression. here, follow closely related mosquito sister
species anopheles coluzzii anopheles gambiae sympatric natural
population mali multiple time points spanning period 25 years. 
this period, observed temporary breakdown mating barriers, which
allowed us explore fate alleles crossed species boundary 
natural population. whole genome sequencing 74 individuals revealed
introgression within 34 genes (0.26% total genes) a. gambiae to
a. coluzzii, majority contained within 4 mb region 2l chromosome
which includes insecticide resistance gene (agap004707). designed a
genotyping assay follow 25 34 introgressed alleles time found 
that a. gambiae alleles, except four, reached frequency 50% the
a. coluzzii population within 4 years (~50 generations) increased ~80%
within 6 years (~75 generations). however, frequency introgressed
alleles, except three, decreased ~60% 2016. suggests ongoing
process purifying selection population dna foreign ancestry,
except alleles positive selection, resulting complex
genomic landscape. study shows stable introgression limited 
specific genes even within closely related species.
