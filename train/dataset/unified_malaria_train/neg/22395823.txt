genes involved host-pathogen interactions often strongly affected by
positive natural selection. duffy antigen, coded duffy antigen
receptor chemokines (darc) gene, serves receptor plasmodium vivax in
humans plasmodium knowlesi nonhuman primates. majority 
sub-saharan africans, nucleic acid variant gata-1 gene promoter is
responsible nonexpression duffy antigen red blood cells and
consequently resistance invasion p. vivax. duffy antigen also acts a
receptor chemokines expressed red blood cells many other
tissues body. dual role, sequenced ~3,000-bp region
encompassing entire darc gene well part 5' 3' flanking
regions phylogenetic sample primates used statistical methods to
evaluate nature selection pressures acting gene its
evolution. analyzed coding regulatory regions darc gene. the
regulatory analysis showed accelerated rates substitution several sites
near known motifs. tests positive selection coding region using
maximum likelihood branch sites maximum likelihood codon sites 
yield statistically significant evidence action positive selection.
however, maximum likelihood test gene subdivided into
different structural regions showed known binding region p. vivax/p.
knowlesi different selective pressures remainder the
gene. fact, gene appears strong purifying selection,
but evident binding region. suggest binding region
is influence two opposing selective pressures, positive selection
possibly exerted parasite purifying selection exerted chemokines.
