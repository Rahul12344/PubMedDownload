the kinome human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum comprises
representatives eukaryotic protein kinase groups, including kinases which
regulate proliferation differentiation processes. despite extensive research 
on plasmodial enzymes, little information available regarding four
identified members cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinase (clk) family. in
other eukaryotes, clks regulate mrna splicing phosphorylation of
serine/arginine-rich proteins. here, investigate two pfclks, lammer
kinase homolog pfclk-1, pfclk-2. pfclks show homology yeast
serine/arginine protein kinase sky1p transcribed throughout asexual
blood stages gametocytes. pfclk-1/lammer possesses two nuclear
localization signal sites pfclk-2 possesses one signal sites
upstream c-terminal catalytic domains. indirect immunofluorescence,
western blot, electron microscopy data confirm kinases primarily
localized parasite nucleus, pfclk-2 present the
cytoplasm. two kinases important completion asexual
replication cycle p. falciparum, demonstrated reverse genetics
approaches. vitro kinase assays show substrate phosphorylation pfclks, 
including sky1p substrate, splicing factor npl3p, plasmodial
alternative splicing factor pfasf-1. mass spectrometric analysis of
co-immunoprecipitated proteins indicates assembly two pfclks proteins
with predicted nuclease, phosphatase, helicase functions. data indicate 
crucial role pfclks malaria blood stage parasites, presumably by
participating gene regulation post-transcriptional modification of
mrna.
