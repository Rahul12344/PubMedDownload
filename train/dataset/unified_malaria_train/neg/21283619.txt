diseases transmitted mosquitoes devastating impact global health and
this worsening due difficulties existing control measures climate 
change. genetically modified mosquitoes refractory disease
transmission seen great potential delivery novel control 
strategies. historically genetic modification insects relied upon
transposable elements many limitations despite successful use.
to circumvent limitations streptomyces phage phic31 integrase system
has successfully adapted site-specific transgene integration insects.
here, present first site-specific transformation anopheles gambiae, the
principal vector human malaria. mosquitoes initially engineered to
incorporate phic31 targeting site defined genomic location. second
phase genetic modification achieved site-specific integration vida3, a
synthetic anti-malarial gene. expression vida3, specifically midgut 
bloodfed females, offered consistent significant protection against
plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis, reducing average parasite intensity 85%.
similar protection observed plasmodium falciparum some
experiments, although protection inconsistent. fight malaria, 
it imperative establish broad repertoire anti-malarial effector
genes tissue-specific promoters expression, enabling offering
maximum effect minimum fitness cost identified. future, this
technology allow effective comparisons informed choices made,
potentially leading complete transmission blockade.
