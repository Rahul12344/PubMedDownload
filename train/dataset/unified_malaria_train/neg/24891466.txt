cyp2a6, cyp2b6, ugt1a9 genetic polymorphisms treatment response a
three-day course artesunate-mefloquine investigated 71 burmese patients
with uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria. results provide evidence for
the possible link cyp2a6 cyp2b6 polymorphisms plasma
concentrations artesunate/dihydroartemisinin treatment response. one
patient cyp2a6*1a/*4c genotype (decreased enzyme activity), plasma
concentration artesunate one hour appeared higher, the
concentration dihydroartemisinin lower carrying other
genotypes (415 versus 320 ng/ml). proportion patients adequate
clinical parasitologic response cyp2b6*9/*9 genotype (mutant
genotype) significantly lower compared late parasitologic
failure (14.0% versus 19.0%). confirmation larger study various
malaria-endemic areas required definite conclusion role of
genetic polymorphisms drug-metabolizing enzymes treatment response
after artesunate-based combination therapy made.
