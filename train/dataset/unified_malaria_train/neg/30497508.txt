background: transmission malaria mosquitoes depends presence 
gametocytes circulate peripheral blood infected human hosts.
sensitive estimates densities female gametocytes (fg) male
gametocytes (mg) may allow prediction infectivity mosquitoes thus a
molecular estimate human infectious reservoir transmission.
methods: novel multiplex qrt-pcr assay intron-spanning primers was
developed parallel quantification fg mg. ccp4 (pf3d7_0903800)
transcripts specific fg pfmget (pf3d7_1469900) transcripts specific for
mg quantified total nucleic acids. assay validated sex-sorted 
gametocytes culture material samples clinical trials with
gametocytocidal drugs. synthetic rna standards generated two targets
genes calibrated known gametocyte quantities.
results: limit detection determined 0.1 male 0.1 female
gametocyte/µl, equal limit quantification (loq) mg, while
the loq fg 1 fg/µl. results previously reported clinical trials that
used separate gametocyte qrt-pcr assays fg (targeting pfs25) mg
(targeting pfmget) reproduced multiplex assay. high levels of
agreement separate assays multiplex approach observed
(r2 = 0.9473, 95% ci 0.9314-0.9632, fg measured transcript levels pfs25
in qrt-pcr ccp4 multiplex; r2 = 0.8869, 95% ci 0.8541-0.9197, mg
measured pfmget either single multiplex qrt-pcr). fg mg transcripts 
were detected pure ring stage parasites 10,000- 100,000-fold reduced
frequency ccp4 pfmget, respectively. ccp4 pfmget transcripts were
equally stable suboptimal storage conditions.
conclusions: gametocyte densities sex ratios determined the
presented one-step multiplex assay higher throughput single assays. the
interpretation low gametocyte densities asexual parasite densities above
1000 parasites/µl requires caution avoid false positive gametocyte signals
from spurious transcript levels ring stage parasites.
