anopheles gambiae major malaria vector africa. examining molecular 
basis a. gambiae traits requires knowledge genetic variation and
genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (ld) map wild a. gambiae populations from
malaria-endemic areas. sequenced genomes nine wild a. gambiae
mosquitoes individually using next-generation sequencing technologies and
detected 2,219,815 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), 88% which
are novel. snps evenly distributed across a. gambiae chromosomes. low
snp-frequency regions overlay heterochromatin chromosome inversion domains,
consistent lower recombinant rates regions. nearly one million 
snps genotyped correctly individual mosquitoes 99.6%
confidence extracted high-throughput sequencing data. based on
these snp genotypes, constructed genome-wide ld map wild a. gambiae from
malaria-endemic areas kenya made available public website.
the average size ld blocks less 40â€‰bp, several large ld blocks
were also discovered clustered around para gene, consistent the
effect insecticide selective sweeps. snps ld map valuable 
resources scientific communities dissect a. gambiae genome.
