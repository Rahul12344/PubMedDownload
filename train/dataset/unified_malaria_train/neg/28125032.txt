the malpighian tubules hindgut renal excretory tissues mosquitoes;
they essential maintaining hemolymph water solute homeostasis.
moreover, make important contributions detoxifying metabolic wastes and
xenobiotics hemolymph. focused elucidating molecular
mechanisms malpighian tubule function adult female mosquitoes and
developing chemical tools prototypes next-generation mosquitocides that
would act via novel mechanism action (i.e., renal failure). date, have
targeted inward rectifier potassium (kir) channels expressed malpighian
tubules yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti malaria mosquito anopheles
gambiae. inhibition channels small molecules inhibits
transepithelial k⁺ fluid secretion malpighian tubules, leading a
disruption hemolymph k⁺ fluid homeostasis adult female mosquitoes. in
addition, used next-generation sequencing characterize the
transcriptome malpighian tubules asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus,
before blood meals, reveal new molecular targets potentially
disrupting malpighian tubule function. within 24 h blood meal, the
malpighian tubules enhance mrna expression genes encoding mechanisms
involved detoxification metabolic wastes produced blood
digestion (e.g., heme, nh₃, reactive oxygen species). development chemical
tools targeting molecular mechanisms malpighian tubules may offer a
promising avenue development mosquitocides highly-selective
against hematophagous females, life stage transmits
pathogens.
