the glycoprotein encoded ackr1 gene expresses duffy blood group
antigens receptor malaria parasites. recently described 18
long-range ackr1 alleles autochthonous population malaria endemic
region. extending work, sequenced gene 53-sample repository
established us food drug administration (fda) reference reagents
for blood group genotyping. fda samples characterized 19 genes;
however, long-range haplotype information genes, including ackr1, was
lacking. used hybrid approach, novel type gene, characterize 
ackr1 combining two next-generation sequencing technologies, short-read
massively parallel sequencing long-read nanopore sequencing. the
expedient integration data next-generation sequencing systems were
necessary sufficient allow determination 25 long-range ackr1
alleles found 53 samples accurately. 25 alleles identified our
current fda cohort novel and, unexpectedly, none observed among the
18 alleles previous study. alleles useful validation,
calibration, proficiency testing red cell genotyping. lack any
overlap ackr1 alleles two studies documents differences in
mutation rate recombination frequency among populations. exact haplotype 
and interethnic interpopulation dissimilarities influence disease
susceptibility therapy.
