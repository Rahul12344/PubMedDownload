the complement-like protein thioester-containing protein 1 (tep1) key factor
in immune response malaria vector anopheles gambiae pathogens.
multiple allelic variants tep1 identified laboratory strains 
in field, correlated distinct immunophenotypes. tep1 tightly 
regulated conformational changes induced cleavage protease-sensitive
region. cleaved tep1 forms exhibit significant variation stability hours 
to days room temperature. particular, refractory allele tep1*r1 is
significantly stable susceptible allele tep1*s1. raises the
question whether stability cleaved tep1 linked allelic variation 
and varying immunophenotypes. analyzed stability cleaved form 
of additional tep1 alleles constructs. show stability correlated
with allelic variation within two specific loops direct proximity the
thioester bond. variable loops part interface ted and
mg8 domains tep1 protect thioester hydrolysis. engineering
specific disulfide bonds prevent separation ted-mg8 interface
stabilizes cleaved form tep1 months room temperature. cleaved tep1 
forms soluble complex heterodimer two leucine-rich repeat proteins,
lrim1 apl1c, precipitates absence complex. molecular
structure oligomeric state tep1/lrim1/apl1c complex unclear. the
c-terminal coiled-coil domain lrim1/apl1c complex sufficient to
stabilize cleaved form tep1 solution cleaved forms of
disulfide-stabilized tep1 interact lrim1/apl1c. implies that
formation tep1cut/lrim1/apl1c complex related conformational
change induces precipitation cleaved tep1.
