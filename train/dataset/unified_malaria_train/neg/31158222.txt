plasmodium vivax causes majority malaria outside africa, poorly
understood cellular level partly due technical difficulties in
maintaining vitro culture conditions. past decades, drug
resistant p. vivax parasites emerged, mainly southeast asia, while
some molecular markers resistance identified, none far 
confirmed experimentally, limits interpretation markers, hence
our ability monitor control spread resistance. these
potential markers identified p. vivax genome-wide population
genetic analyses, highlighted genes recent evolutionary selection 
southeast asia, chloroquine resistance prevalent. genes could
be involved drug resistance, experimental proof currently exists to
support hypothesis. study, used plasmodium knowlesi, most
closely related species p. vivax cultured human erythrocytes,
as model system express p. vivax genes test role drug
resistance. adopted strategy episomal expression, able to
express fourteen p. vivax genes, including two allelic variants several
hypothetical resistance genes. expression level localisation were
assessed, confirming cellular locations conjectured orthologous species, and
suggesting locations several previously unlocalised proteins, including an
apical location pvx_101445. findings establish p. knowlesi a
suitable model p. vivax protein expression. performed chloroquine and
mefloquine drug assays, finding significant differences drug sensitivity:
these results could due technical issues, could indicate these
genes actually involved drug resistance, despite positive 
selection pressure southeast asia. data confirm vitro p.
knowlesi useful tool studying p. vivax biology. close evolutionary
relationship p. vivax, high transfection efficiency, availability of
markers colocalisation, make powerful model system. study the
first kind using p. knowlesi study unknown p. vivax proteins and
investigate drug resistance mechanisms.
