background: human infections due monkey malaria parasite plasmodium
knowlesi rise southeast asian countries specifically malaysia. 
the c-terminal 19Â kda domain pvmsp1p potential vaccine candidate,
however, study conducted orthologous gene p. knowlesi. this
study investigates level polymorphisms, haplotypes natural selection of
full-length pkmsp1p clinical samples malaysia.
methods: total 36 full-length pkmsp1p sequences along reference
h-strain 40 c-terminal pkmsp1p sequences clinical isolates malaysia
were downloaded published genomes. genetic diversity, polymorphism,
haplotype natural selection determined using dnasp 5.10 mega 5.0
software. genealogical relationships determined using haplotype network tree
in network software v5.0. population genetic differentiation index (f st ) and
population structure parasite determined using arlequin v3.5 structure
v2.3.4 software.
results: comparison 36 full-length pkmsp1p sequences along h-strain
identified 339 snps (175 non-synonymous 164 synonymous substitutions). the
nucleotide diversity across full-length gene low compared ortholog
pvmsp1p. nucleotide diversity higher toward n-terminal domains
(pkmsp1p-83 30) compared c-terminal domains (pkmsp1p-38, 33 19).
phylogenetic analysis full-length genes identified 2 distinct clusters p.
knowlesi malaysian borneo. 40 pkmsp1p-19 sequences showed low
polymorphisms 16 polymorphisms leading 18 haplotypes. total were
10 synonymous 6 non-synonymous substitutions 12 cysteine residues were
intact within two egf domains. evidence strong purifying selection was
observed within full-length sequences well domains. shared
haplotypes 40 pkmsp1p-19 identified within malaysian borneo haplotypes.
conclusions: study first report genetic diversity and
natural selection pkmsp1p. low level genetic diversity strong
evidence negative selection detected observed domains of
pkmsp1p p. knowlesi indicating functional constrains. shared haplotypes were
identified within pkmsp1p-19 highlighting evaluation using larger number 
of clinical samples malaysia.
