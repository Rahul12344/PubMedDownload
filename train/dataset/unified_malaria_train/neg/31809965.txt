background: imported cases infectious disease provide invaluable information
about epidemiological conditions abroad, guide treatment decisions 
home abroad. here, examined cases malaria imported africa china
for mutations eroding efficacy sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), sometimes
used intermittent preventive treatment pregnant women and
infants.
methods: total 208 blood samples collected p. falciparum-infected 
workers returned western central africa guangxi province
frequency distribution. samples analyzed mutations dhfr dhps 
genes pcr -sequencing. prevalence dhfr dhps polymorphisms was
analyzed. among isolates, polymorphisms detected mutants n51i, c59r, 
s108n i164l pfdhfr i431v, s436 a/f, a437g, k540 e/n, a581g a613t
of pfdhps.
results: mutations promoting drug resistance widespread cohort. 
pfdhfr pfdhps, wild types equally rare among patients returned from
western africa central africa. triple-mutant dhfr haplotype most
prevalent (>70%). report first time mutation i164l-dhfr i431v-dhps
in ghana, first time found a581g exceed clinically-relevant
threshold may counter-indicate current clinical practices. pfdhps, the
double-mutant iagkaa high prevalent haplotype ghana, western africa. the
single-mutant isgkaa majority haplotype cameroon. alarmingly, "super
resistance" quintuple mutant detected, first time, parasites of
west african origin (defined iagkaa/irni combination pfdhps 581g and
dhfr i164l). may limit efficacy drug combination even
intermittent clinical applications.
conclusions: data cause great concern call continued
surveillance efficacy sp source recipient populations, and
should considered developing treatment policy imported malaria cases 
in china elsewhere.
