enterocytozoon bieneusi frequently diagnosed microsporidian species
in humans. found wide range animals considered an
important zoonotic pathogen. date, little information available role
that cattle play epidemiology human microsporidiosis caused e.
bieneusi china. study, 133 fecal specimens dairy cattle were
collected heilongjiang province, china. enterocytozoon bieneusi identified
and genotyped nested pcr analysis internal transcribed spacer (its)
region rrna gene, 30.1% positive. nine genotypes identified:
six known genotypes-o (n = 26), ebpa (n = 2), (n = 2), j (n = 2), (n = 1) and
beb4 (n = 1)-and three novel genotypes named cc-i cc-iii (two each).
genotype identified cattle first time. observation all
the six known genotypes reported previously humans, also fact 
all three novel genotypes (chn-dc1 chn-dc3) falling zoonotic group 1,
indicate possibility cattle transmission e. bieneusi humans.
