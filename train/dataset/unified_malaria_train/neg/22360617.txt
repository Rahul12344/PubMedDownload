the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum dynamically regulates transcription of
the majority genes intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.
chromatin important contributor tight regulation gene
expression. p. falciparum appears utilize mechanisms chromatin 
creation modification found eukaryotes, although occasionally
uses surprising ways. much p. falciparum genome maintained a
euchromatic state, potentially permissive transcription heterochromatin
appears specialized role limited silencing islands genes involved
in redundant host-parasite interactions. p. falciparum histones share canonical
modifications eukaryotes also unique modifications unknown
function including hyperacetylations two alternative histones possibly
involved gene regulation. much knowledge chromatin regulation of
gene expression p. falciparum derives study virulence genes that
are subject chromatin regulatory mechanisms ranging histone modifications
and nucleosomal occupancy non-protein-coding rnas subnuclear architecture.
these mechanisms discussed along characterized components of
p. falciparum chromatin.
