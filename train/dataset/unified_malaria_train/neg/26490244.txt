background: control malaria threatened emerging parasite resistance to
artemisinin derivative drug (art) therapies. molecular detail how
plasmodium malaria parasites respond art could contribute to
resistance well understood. address question, performed a
transcriptomic study dihydroartemisinin (dha) response p. falciparum k1
strain p. berghei anka strain using microarray rna-seq technology.
results: microarray data dha-treated p. falciparum trophozoite stage
parasites revealed response pattern overall less trophozoite-like and
more like stages asexual development. meta-analysis data 
with previously published data art treatments revealed set common
differentially expressed genes. notably, ribosomal protein genes are
down-regulated response art. similar pattern trophozoite
transcriptomic change observed rna-seq data. rna-seq data from
dha-treated p. falciparum rings reveal muted response, although is
considerable overlap differentially expressed genes dha-treated
trophozoites. genes differentially expressed dha-treated p. falciparum 
schizonts. transcriptional response p. berghei dha treatment vivo in
infected mice similar p. falciparum vitro culture ring and
trophozoite responses, ribosomal protein genes notably
down-regulated.
conclusions: ring trophozoite stage plasmodium respond art arresting
metabolic processes protein synthesis glycolysis. response can
be protective rings, shown phenomenon dormancy. contrast, this
response protective trophozoites owing commitment a
highly active vulnerable metabolic state. lower metabolic demands of
schizonts could explain less sensitive unresponsive art. 
art response pattern revealed clearly rna-seq data, suggesting 
technology great utility studying drug response plasmodium.
