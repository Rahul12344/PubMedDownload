micrornas (mirnas) constitute class small (18-22 nucleotides) non-coding
rnas regulate gene expression post-transcriptional level.
caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, many small organisms
have instrumental deciphering biological functions mirnas. while
some mirnas small organisms highly conserved across taxa, others are
organism specific. mirnas known play crucial role development
and various cellular functions cell survival, cell proliferation, 
differentiation. mirnas associated fragile x syndrome, parkinson's
disease, alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, malaria, infectious diseases 
several human diseases identified small organisms. these
organisms used platforms deciphering functions mirnas in
the pathogenesis human diseases study mirna biogenesis. small organisms
have also used development mirna-based diagnostic, prognostic 
therapeutic strategies. molecular techniques genome sequencing,
northern blot analysis, quantitative rt-pcr, used deciphering
the functions mirnas small organisms. mirnas small organisms
especially drosophila c. elegans regulate development disease 
pathogenesis focus review. outstanding questions raised our
current understanding discussed.
