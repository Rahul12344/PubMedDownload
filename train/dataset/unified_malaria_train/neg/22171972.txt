background: g6pd deficiency common malaria endemic regions estimated
to affect 400 million people worldwide. treatment malaria patients
with anti-malarial drug primaquine 8-aminoquinolines may be
associated potential haemolytic anaemia. aim present study to
investigate prevalence g6pd variants thai population resided in
malaria endemic areas (western, northern, north-eastern, southern, eastern and
central regions) thailand, well burmese population resided in
areas along thai-myanmar border.
methods: ten common g6pd variants investigated dried blood spot
samples collected 317 thai (84 males, 233 females) 183 burmese (11
males, 172 females) populations residing malaria endemic areas thailand
using pcr-rflp method.
results: four seven g6pd variants observed samples collected from
burmese thai population, prevalence 6.6% (21/317) 14.2% (26/183),
respectively. almost (96.2%) g6pd mutation samples collected burmese 
population carried g6pd mahidol variant; one sample (3.8%) carried g6pd
kaiping variant. thai population, g6pd mahidol (8/21: 38.1%) most
common variant detected, followed g6pd viangchan (4/21: 19.0%), g6pd chinese 4
(3/21: 14.3%), g6pd canton (2/21: 9.5%), g6pd union (2/21: 9.5%), g6pd kaiping
(1/21: 4.8%), g6pd gaohe (1/21: 4.8%). g6pd chinese 3, chinese 5 and
coimbra variants found. limited sample size, appeared 
variation g6pd mutation variants samples obtained thai population in
different regions particularly western region.
conclusions: results indicate difference prevalence distribution of
g6pd gene variants among thai burmese populations different malaria
endemic areas. dosage regimen primaquine treatment plasmodium
falciparum plasmodium vivax malaria may need optimized, based on
endemic areas supporting data g6pd variants. larger sample size from
different malaria endemic required obtain accurate genetic mapping g6pd 
variants burmese thai population residing malaria endemic areas of
thailand.
