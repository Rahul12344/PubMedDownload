background: knowledge origins, distribution, inheritance variation 
in malaria parasite (plasmodium falciparum) genome crucial for
understanding evolution; however 81% (a+t) genome poses challenges to
high-throughput sequencing technologies. explore viability roche
454 genome sequencer flx (gs flx) high throughput sequencing technology 
whole genome sequencing fine-resolution characterization genetic exchange 
in malaria parasites.
results: present scheme survey recombination haploid stage genomes
of two sibling parasite clones, using whole genome pyrosequencing includes a
sliding window approach predict recombination breakpoints. whole genome
shotgun (wgs) sequencing generated approximately 2 million reads, average
read length approximately 300 bp. de novo assembly using combination wgs 
and 3 kb paired end libraries resulted contigs ≤ 34 kb. 8,000 the
24,599 snp markers identified parents genotyped progeny,
resulting marker density approximately 1 marker/3.3 kb allowing for
the detection previously unrecognized crossovers (cos) many non crossover 
(nco) gene conversions throughout genome.
conclusions: sequencing 23 mb genomes two haploid progeny clones
derived genetic cross 30× coverage, captured high
resolution information cos, ncos genetic variation within progeny
genomes. study first resequence progeny clones examine fine
structure cos ncos malaria parasites.
