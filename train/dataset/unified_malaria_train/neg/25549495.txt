apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) plasmodium vivax grassi et feletti, 1890 
a promising malaria vaccine candidate. however, antigenic variation major
problem design universal malaria vaccine. hence, detailed understanding of
the pvama-1 gene polymorphism provide conductive information this
potential vaccine component. therefore, study investigated extent of
genetic polymorphisms domain (di), dii partial diii ama-1 among
iranian p. vivax isolates. 107 blood samples, 92 analysed based on
the quality sequencing data. sequences classified 53
haplotypes. amino acid changes observed 31 positions 17 located
at di, 11 dii rest (3 positions) diii. thus,
codon polymorphisms di found higher dii. also, five these
polymorphic codons (d242e, t374p, s389r, y391f, i395f) novel not
been reported yet. neutrality analysis using dn-ds difference (the
difference rate non-synonymous synonymous mutations) showed 
negative diversifying selection di, dii across length domains.
the potential b-cell epitopes found 5 regions pvama-1 10
mutation sites (e145a, k188n, e189n/k/d, k190q/e, p210s, e227v, d242e, r249h,
g253e, k352e), whereas one mutation (g288e) detected in
intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions. fixation index (fst) estimation
between iranian indian isolates (0.0131) indicated significant low genetic 
differentiation. distribution polymorphic sites iurs mapped three
dimensional structure pvama-1 showed regions located two
opposite faces molecule. conclusion, results significant value
in design development malaria vaccine based antigen.
