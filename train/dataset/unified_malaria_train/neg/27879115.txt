this volume inspired topics presented international conference 
"micro macro systems life sciences" held jun 8-12, 2015 in
bÄ™dlewo, poland. system biology approach tries understand how
micro systems, molecular cellular levels, affect macro systems as
organs, tissue populations. thus surprising major theme of
this volume evolves around cancer treatment. articles topic
include models tumor induced angiogenesis, without delays,
metastatic niche bone marrow, drug resistance metronomic chemotherapy,
and virotherapy glioma. methods range dynamical systems optimal
control. another well represented topic volume mathematical modeling
in epidemiology. mathematical approaches modeling control specific
diseases like malaria, ebola human papillomavirus discussed well a
more general approaches seir, even general class models in
epidemiology, using tools optimal control optimization. volume 
also brings challenges mathematical modeling diseases as
tuberculosis. partial differential equations combined numerical approaches
are becoming important tools modeling tumor growth treatment, but
also diseases, fibrosis liver, atherosclerosis its
associated blood flow dynamics, volume presents state art
approach topics. understanding mathematics behind cell motion,
appearance special patterns various cell populations, age
structured mutations among topics addressed inour volume. spatio-temporal
models synthetic genetic oscillators brings analysis gene level
which focus much current biological research. mathematics help
biologists explain collective behavior bacterial, topic also 
presented here. finally across discipline topics being
addresses, appear challenge studying problems systems
biology all, macro, meso micro levels. include numerical approaches
to stochastic wave equation arising modeling brownian motion, discrete
velocity models, many particle approximations well important aspect on
the connection discrete measurement construction models
for various phenomena, particularly one involving delays. variety of
biological topics mathematical approaches much hope the
reader mathematical biosciences engineering find volume
interesting inspirational research.
