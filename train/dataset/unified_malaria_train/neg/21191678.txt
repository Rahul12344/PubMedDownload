heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) heat shock protein 40 (hsp40) function as
molecular chaperones folding trafficking proteins within most
cell types. however, hsp70-hsp40 chaperone partnerships within malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, elucidated. one 43 p. 
falciparum hsp40s predicted cytosolic, canonical hsp40 (termed
pfhsp40) capable interacting major cytosolic p. falciparum-encoded
hsp70, pfhsp70. consistent hypothesis, found pfhsp40 is
upregulated heat shock conditions similar pattern pfhsp70. in
addition, pfhsp70 pfhsp40 reside mainly parasite cytosol, assessed 
using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. recombinant pfhsp40 stimulated 
atp hydrolytic rates pfhsp70 human hsp70 similar canonical
hsp40s yeast (ydj1) human (hdj2) origin. contrast, hsp40-stimulated
plasmodial human hsp70 atpase activities differentially inhibited the
presence pyrimidinone-based small molecule modulators. probe the
chaperone properties pfhsp40, protein aggregation suppression assays were
conducted. pfhsp40 alone suppressed protein aggregation, cooperated with
pfhsp70 suppress aggregation. together, data represent first
cellular biochemical evidence pfhsp70-pfhsp40 partnership the
malaria parasite, furthermore plasmodial human hsp70-hsp40
chaperones possess unique attributes differentially modulated small
molecules.
