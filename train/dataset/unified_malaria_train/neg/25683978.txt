purpose: although polymorphisms erythrocyte complement receptor type 1
(cr1) patients malaria extensively studied, question of
whether polymorphisms cr1 associated severe malaria remains
controversial. furthermore, study examined association cr1
polymorphisms malaria chinese population. therefore, investigated 
relationship cr1 gene polymorphism malaria chinese population.
materials methods: analyzed polymorphisms cr1 gene rs2274567 g/a,
rs4844600 g/a, rs2296160 c/t 509 patients malaria 503 controls,
using taqman genotyping assay pcr-direct sequencing.
results: significant differences genotype, allele and
haplotype frequencies cr1 gene rs2274567 g/a, rs4844600 g/a, rs2296160 c/t
polymorphisms patients malaria controls. furthermore, 
no association polymorphisms cr1 gene severity malaria in
chinese population.
conclusion: findings suggest cr1 gene rs2274567 g/a, rs4844600 g/a,
and rs2296160 c/t polymorphisms may involved susceptibility malaria 
in chinese population.
