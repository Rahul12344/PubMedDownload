background: major malaria vector sri lanka reported anopheles
culicifacies anopheles subpictus, anopheles annularis, anopheles varuna 
considered potential vectors. occurrence anopheles stephensi, 
the key vector urban malaria india middle east, never been
reported sri lanka.
methods: series entomological investigations carried anti
malaria campaign, ministry health, sri lanka december 2016 april
2017 two localities mannar district northern province the
country. adult mosquito collections done indoor outdoor resting 
collections, animal human biting collections emergence traps. potential
mosquito breeding sites investigated larval surveys. larvae 
adults an. stephensi initially identified using morphological keys, and
subsequently confirmed sequencing barcode region cytochrome c
oxidase (coi) gene.
results: first report presence an. stephensi island 
of mannar northern province sri lanka. anopheles stephensi (36.65%) was
the abundant anopheline species larval habitats mannar. was
found breeding together an. culicifacies (20.7%), an. subpictus (13.5%) 
an. varuna (28.13%). anopheles stephensi found abundantly breeding in
built wells used domestic purposes. adult females an. stephensi were
observed emergence trap collections (93.9%), human landing catches night
(79.2%), pyrethrum spray sheet collections (38.6%), outdoor collections (8.3%),
donkey-baited trap collections (14.3), cattle-baited net trap collections
(0.7%).
conclusions: sri lanka certified malaria-free september
2016, however, new finding may pose serious challenge efforts of
the ministry health prevent re-introduction malaria transmission 
the country, considering role an. stephensi could play urban high
vulnerability areas sri lanka.
