background: anti-malarial drug resistance threatens undermine efforts to
eliminate deadly disease. resulting omnipresent requirement drugs
with novel modes action prompted national consortium initiative discover 
new anti-plasmodial agents south african medicinal plants. one plants
selected investigation dicoma anomala subsp. gerrardii, based its
ethnomedicinal profile.
methods: standard phytochemical analysis techniques, including solvent-solvent
extraction, thin-layer- column chromatography, used isolate main 
active constituent dicoma anomala subsp. gerrardii. crystallized pure
compound identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass
spectrometry x-ray crystallography. compound tested vitro on
plasmodium falciparum cultures using parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pldh)
assay found anti-malarial activity. determine functional
groups responsible activity, small collection synthetic analogues
was generated - aim vary features proposed likely related
to anti-malarial activity quantify effect modifications 
vitro using pldh assay. effects pure compound p. falciparum
transcriptome subsequently investigated treating ring-stage parasites
(alongside untreated controls), followed oligonucleotide microarray- data 
analysis.
results: main active constituent identified dehydrobrachylaenolide, 
eudesmanolide-type sesquiterpene lactone. compound demonstrated vitro
ic50 1.865 μm chloroquine-sensitive strain (d10) p. falciparum.
synthetic analogues compound confirmed absolute requirement the
α-methylene lactone present eudesmanolide significant
anti-malarial activity observed. feature absent artemisinins
and suggests different mode action. microarray data analysis identified 572 
unique genes differentially expressed result treatment 
gene ontology analysis identified various biological processes molecular
functions significantly affected. comparison the
dehydrobrachylaenolide treatment transcriptional dataset published
artesunate (also sesquiterpene lactone) dataset revealed little overlap. 
results strengthen notion isolated compound artemisinins
have differentiated modes action.
conclusions: novel mode action dehydrobrachylaenolide, detected 
these studies, play ongoing role advancing anti-plasmodial drug
discovery efforts.
