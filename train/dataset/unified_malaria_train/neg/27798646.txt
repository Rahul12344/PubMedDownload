background: plasmodium vivax causes majority malaria episodes outside
africa, remains relatively understudied pathogen. pathology p. vivax
infection depends critically parasite's ability recognize invade
human erythrocytes. invasion process involves interaction p.
vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp) merozoites duffy antigen receptor 
for chemokines (darc) erythrocyte surface. whole-genome sequencing of
clinical isolates recently established p. vivax genomes contain two
copies pvdbp gene. frequency duplication particularly high 
in madagascar, also evidence p. vivax infection in
darc-negative individuals. functional significance global prevalence of
this duplication, whether copy number variations pvdbp
locus, unknown.
methodology/principal findings: using whole-genome sequencing pcr study
the pvdbp locus p. vivax clinical isolates, found pvdbp duplication is
widespread cambodia. boundaries cambodian pvdbp duplication differ 
from previously identified madagascar, meaning current molecular
assays unable detect it. cambodian pvdbp duplication not
associate parasite density darc genotype, ranged prevalence from
20% 38% four annual transmission seasons cambodia. duplication
was also present p. vivax isolates brazil ethiopia, india.
conclusions/significance: pvdbp duplications much widespread complex
than previously thought, least two distinct duplications circulating
globally. duplication boundaries identified parasites three
continents, found high prevalence human populations where
darc-negativity essentially absent. therefore unlikely pvdbp
duplication associated infection darc-negative individuals, but
functional tests required confirm hypothesis.
