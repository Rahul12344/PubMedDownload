southeast asia (the thailand-cambodia border) considered primal
epicenter antimalarial drug resistance; however, numerous molecular
epidemiological studies successively reported multiple independent origins
of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance-associated plasmodium falciparum
dhfr (pfdhfr) pfdhps alleles areas. better understand origin 
and evolutionary pathway sp resistance southeast asia, total 374
p. falciparum field isolates yunnan-burma border hainan island in
southern china collected comprehensive investigations the

haplotypes. comparative analysis single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp)
genotyping flanking microsatellite haplotypes, reveal unique origin of
pyrimethamine-resistant mutations pfdhfr gene hainan island oriented

raising concern genetic basis adopting combination chemotherapies
against falciparum malaria.
