background: increased resistance plasmodium falciparum parasites led the
withdrawal antimalarial drugs chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
in ethiopia. since 2004 artemether-lumefantrine served treat uncomplicated
p. falciparum malaria. however, increasing reports delayed parasite clearance 
to artemisinin opens new challenge anti-malarial therapy. the
complete withdrawal cq treatment plasmodium falciparum malaria,
this study assessed evolution cq resistance investigating the
prevalence mutant alleles pfmdr1 pfcrt genes p. falciparum and
pvmdr1 gene plasmodium vivax southern eastern ethiopia.
methods: 1,416 febrile patients attending primary health facilities in
southern ethiopia, 329 febrile patients positive p. falciparum p. vivax
were recruited. similarly 1,304 febrile patients eastern ethiopia, 81
febrile patients positive p. falciparum p. vivax included the
study. 410 finger prick blood samples collected malaria patients, 
used direct sequencing investigate prevalence mutations pfcrt and
pfmdr1. included determining gene copy number pfmdr1 195 p.
falciparum clinical isolates, mutations pvmdr1 locus 215 p. vivax
clinical isolates.
results: pfcrt k76 cq-sensitive allele observed 84.1% the
investigated p.falciparum clinical isolates. pfcrt double mutations (k76t and
c72s) observed less 3%. pfcrt svmnt haplotype also found 
present clinical isolates ethiopia. pfcrt cvmnk-sensitive haplotypes 
were frequently observed (95.9%). pfmdr1 mutation n86y observed in
14.9% compared 85.1% clinical isolates carried sensitive alleles. 
also, sensitive pfmdr1 y184 allele common, 94.9% clinical
isolates. none investigated p. falciparum clinical isolates carried
s1034c, n1042d d1246y pfmdr1 polymorphisms. investigated p. falciparum
clinical isolates southern eastern ethiopia carried single copy
of mutant pfmdr1 gene.
conclusion: study reports first time return chloroquine
sensitive p. falciparum ethiopia. findings support rationale the
use cq-based combination drugs possible future alternative.
