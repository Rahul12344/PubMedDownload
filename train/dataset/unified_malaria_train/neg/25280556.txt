in planta production recombinant proteins, including vaccine antigens and
monoclonal antibodies, continues gaining acceptance. broadening range of
target proteins, need vectors higher performance increasing.
here, developed single-replicon vector based beet yellows virus
(byv) enables co-delivery two target genes host cell,
resulting transient expression target. byv vector maintained
genetic stability systemic spread throughout host plant, nicotiana
benthamiana. furthermore, engineered minibyv vector carrying the
sequences encoding heavy light chains monoclonal antibody (mab) 
protective antigen (pa) bacillius anthracis, achieved expression of
the full-length functional anti-pa mab ~300 mg/kg fresh leaf tissue. to
demonstrate co-expression functionality two independent proteins, we
cloned sequences pfs48/45 protein plasmodium falciparum and
endoglycosidase f (pngase f) flavobacterium meningosepticum minibyv
vector control two subgenomic rna promoters. agroinfiltration n. 
benthamiana minibyv vector resulted accumulation biologically
active pfs48/45 devoid n-linked glycosylation correct
conformation epitope display. overall, findings demonstrate new 
byv-based vector capable co-expressing two functionally active recombinant 
proteins within host cell.
