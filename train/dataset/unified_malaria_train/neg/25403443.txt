we used genome-wide screen mutagenized mice identify genes which
inactivation protects lethal neuroinflammation experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm). identified ecm-protective mutation coiled-coil
domain containing protein 88b (ccdc88b), poorly annotated gene found
expressed specifically spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus. the
ccdc88b protein abundantly expressed immune cells, including cd4(+)
and cd8(+) lymphocytes, myeloid cells, loss ccdc88b protein
expression pleiotropic effects lymphocyte functions, including impaired 
maturation vivo, significantly reduced activation, reduced cell division as
well impaired cytokine production (ifn-γ tnf) response cell
receptor engagement, nonspecific stimuli vitro, course of
p. berghei infection vivo. identifies ccdc88b novel important
regulator cell function. human ccdc88b gene maps 11q13 locus that
is associated susceptibility several inflammatory auto-immune
disorders. findings strongly suggest ccdc88b morbid gene
underlying pleiotropic effect 11q13 locus inflammation.
