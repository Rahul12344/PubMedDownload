malaria caused unicellular apicomplexan parasites genus plasmodium, 
which includes major human parasite plasmodium falciparum. complex cycle 
of malaria parasite mosquito human hosts studied
extensively. tight control gene expression developmental
stage, every level gene synthesis: rna transcription, its
subsequent translation, finally post-translational modifications the
resulting protein. whole-genome sequencing p. falciparum laid the
foundation significant biological advances revealing surprising genomic
information. p. falciparum genome extremely at-rich (∼80%), a
substantial portion genes encoding intragenic polyadenosine (polya) tracks
being expressed throughout entire parasite life cycle. eukaryotes,
intragenic polya runs act negative regulators gene expression. recent
studies shown translation mrnas containing 12 consecutive
adenosines results ribosomal stalling frameshifting; activating mrna
surveillance mechanisms. contrast, p. falciparum translational machinery can
efficiently accurately translate polya tracks without activating mrna
surveillance pathways. unique feature p. falciparum raises interesting
questions: (1) p. falciparum able efficiently correctly translate
polya track transcripts, (2) specifics translational
machinery mrna surveillance mechanisms separate p. falciparum other
organisms? review, analyze possible evolutionary shifts p.
falciparum protein synthesis machinery allow efficient translation au 
rich-transcriptome. focus physiological structural differences p.
falciparum stage specific ribosomes, ribosome-associated proteins, changes in
mrna surveillance mechanisms throughout complete parasite life cycle, an
emphasis mosquito liver stages.
