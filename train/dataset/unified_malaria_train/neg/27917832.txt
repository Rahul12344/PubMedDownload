serine protease inhibitors (serpins) insects function within development,
wound healing immunity. genome african malaria vector, anopheles
gambiae, encodes 23 distinct serpin proteins, several implicated 
disease-relevant physiological responses. a. gambiae serpin 18 (srpn18) was
previously categorized non-inhibitory based sequence its
reactive-center loop (rcl), region responsible targeting initiating
protease inhibition. crystal structure a. gambiae srpn18 determined to
a resolution 1.45 å, including nearly entire rcl one two
molecules asymmetric unit. structure reveals srpn18 rcl is
extremely short constricted, feature associated noncanonical
inhibitors non-inhibitory serpin superfamily members. furthermore, srpn18 
rcl contain suitable protease target site contains large number 
of prolines. srpn18 structure therefore reveals unique rcl architecture
among highly conserved serpin fold.
