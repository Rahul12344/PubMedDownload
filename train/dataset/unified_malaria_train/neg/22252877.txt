we previously reported design expression chimeric recombinant
proteins effective platform deliver malaria vaccines. erythrocytic
and exoerythrocytic protein chimeras described included autologous helper
epitopes genetically linked defined b cell epitopes. proof-of-principle
studies using vaccine constructs based plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite 
protein (csp) p. yoelii merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) showed
encouraging results tested individually mouse malaria model. to
evaluate potential synergistic additive effect combining chimeric
antigens, constructed synthetic gene encoding hybrid protein combined
both polypeptides single immunogen. multistage vaccine expressed 
soluble form escherichia coli high yield. report the
multistage protein induced robust immune responses individual components, with
no evidence vaccine interference. passive immunization using purified igg from
rabbits immunized hybrid protein conferred robust protection
against experimental challenge p. yoelii sporozoites passive
immunization purified igg rabbits immunized individual
proteins. high antibody titers high frequencies cd4(+)- and
cd8(+)-specific cytokine-secreting cells elicited vaccination. cells 
were multifunctional able simultaneously produce interleukin-2 (il-2),
gamma interferon (ifn-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α). mechanism 
of vaccine-induced protection involved neutralizing antibodies effector
cd4(+) cells resulted control hyperparasitemia protection
against malarial anemia. data support strategy using array of
autologous helper epitopes maximize response multistage malaria
vaccines.
