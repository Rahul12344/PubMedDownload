intercellular adhesion molecules (icams) belong immunoglobulin superfamily
and participate diverse cellular processes including host-pathogen
interactions. icam-1 expressed various cell types including macrophages,
whereas icam-4 restricted red blood cells. report the
identification 11-kda synthetic protein, m5, binds human icam-1 and
icam-4, shown vitro interaction studies, surface plasmon resonance and
immunolocalization. m5 greatly inhibits invasion macrophages and
erythrocytes mycobacterium tuberculosis plasmodium falciparum,
respectively. pharmacological sirna-mediated inhibition icam-1 expression 
also results reduced m. tuberculosis invasion macrophages. icam-4 binds 
p. falciparum merozoites, addition recombinant icam-4 parasite
cultures blocks invasion erythrocytes newly released merozoites. our
results indicate icam-1 icam-4 play roles host cell invasion m.
tuberculosis p. falciparum, respectively, either receptors crucial
accessory molecules.
