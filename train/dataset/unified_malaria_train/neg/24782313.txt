malaria preventable treatable disease; yet half world's
population lives risk infection, estimated 660,000 people die of
malaria-related causes every year. rising drug resistance threatens make
malaria untreatable, necessitating discovery new antimalarial agents 
and development strategies identify suppress emergence and
spread drug resistance. focused in-development dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (dhodh) inhibitors. characterizing resistance pathways for
antimalarial agents yet clinical use increase understanding of
the potential resistance. identified resistance mechanisms plasmodium
falciparum (pf) dhodh inhibitors via vitro resistance selections. found 11 
point mutations pfdhodh target. target gene amplification unknown
mechanisms also contributed resistance, albeit lesser extent. these
mutant parasites often hypersensitive pfdhodh inhibitors, which
immediately suggested novel combination therapy approach preventing
resistance. indeed, combination wild-type mutant-type selective
inhibitors led resistance far less often either drug alone. effects
of point mutations pfdhodh corroborated purified recombinant
wild-type mutant-type pfdhodh proteins, showed trends drug 
response cognate cell lines. comparative growth assays demonstrated that
two mutant parasites grew less robustly wild-type parent, the
purified protein mutants showed decrease catalytic efficiency,
thereby suggesting reason diminished growth rate. co-crystallography of
pfdhodh three inhibitors suggested hydrophobic interactions are
important drug binding selectivity.
