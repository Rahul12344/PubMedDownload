the recent emergence artemisinin (art) resistance plasmodium falciparum 
western cambodia, manifested delayed parasite clearance, big threat to
the long-term efficacy family antimalarial drugs. among multiple
candidate genes associated art resistance p. falciparum, the
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase pfatp6 postulated 
specific target arts. pfatp6 gene harbors multiple single-nucleotide
polymorphisms field parasite populations, s769n associated with
decreased sensitivity artemether parasite populations french guiana.
in study, used allelic exchange strategy engineer parasite lines
carrying s769n mutations p. falciparum strain 3d7 evaluated whether
introduction mutation modulated parasite sensitivity art derivatives. 
using three transgenic lines carrying 769n mutation two transgenic lines 
carrying wild-type 769s controls, found s769n affect
pfatp6 gene expression. compared sensitivities parasite lines 
three art derivatives, artemether, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, 18
biological experiments detected significant effect s769n mutation
on parasite response art derivatives. study provides further
evidence lack association pfatp6 art resistance.
