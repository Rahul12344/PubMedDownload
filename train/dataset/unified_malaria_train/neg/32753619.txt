malaria devastating infectious disease immune response complex
and dynamic course malarial infection. rodent malaria models allow 
detailed time-series studies host response multiple organs. here, we
describe two comprehensive datasets containing host transcriptomic data both
the blood spleen throughout acute blood stage infection virulent or
avirulent plasmodium chabaudi infection c57bl/6 mice. mrna expression
profiles generated using illumina beadchip microarray. datasets
provide groundwork comprehensive comparative studies host gene
expression early, acute recovering phases blood stage infection in
both blood spleen, explore interaction two, and
importantly investigate whether responses differ virulent and
avirulent infections.
