the apicoplast highly specialized organelle mediates required functions
in growth replication apicomplexan parasites. despite structural
conservation apicoplast among different parasite genera species, there
are also critical differences metabolic requirements different
parasites different stages life cycle. specifically compare
apicoplast pathways parasites common unique stages, we
characterized apicoplast babesia bovis, intraerythrocytic
asexual stages mammalian host, compared plasmodium
falciparum, asexual intraerythrocytic hepatic stages.
specifically focusing type ii fatty acid (fasii) isoprenoid (mep)
biosynthesis pathways, searched pathway components retention active
sites within genome, localized key components [acyl carrier protein (acp) and
4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (lytb)] apicoplast, and
demonstrated n-terminal bipartite signals proteins required 
and sufficient trafficking apicoplast lumen. using specific
pharmacologic inhibition, demonstrated mep biosynthesis may disrupted 
and presence required intraerythrocytic growth b. bovis asexual
stages, consistent genomic pathway analysis requirement 
the asexual erythrocytic stages p. falciparum. contrast, fasii biosynthesis
may may present specific drug targets inhibitory
effect b. bovis intraerythrocytic growth, consistent lack of
requirement p. falciparum intraerythrocytic growth. however, genomic analysis
revealed loss fasii pathway components b. bovis whereas pathway 
intact p. falciparum regulated expressed needed (hepatic
stages) silent (intraerythrocytic stages). results indicate
specialized molding apicoplast biosynthetic pathways meet requirements 
of individual apicomplexan parasites unique intracellular niches.
