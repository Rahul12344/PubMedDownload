background: genetic polymorphism inevitable component multistage
infectious organism, malaria parasite. means genetic
polymorphism, parasite opts particular polymorph reveals survival advantage. 
pvs25 pvs28 sexual stage antigen genes, expressed ookinete stage
inside mosquito gut, considered potential transmission-blocking
vaccine candidates. study presents sequence variations two important
transmission blocking antigen genes pvs25 pvs28 field isolates p.
vivax indian subcontinent.
methods: one hundred microscopically diagnosed p. vivax isolates collected
from five geographical regions india. pvs25 pvs28 genes pcr amplified
and sequenced assess sequence variation among field isolates.
results: total 26 amino acid substitutions observed pvs25 (10) and
pvs28 (16) among field isolates p. vivax. tandem repeat polymorphism observed 
in pvs28 shows 3-6 tandem repeats field isolates. seven eight novel
amino acid substitutions observed pvs25 pvs28, respectively indian
isolates. comparison amino acid substitutions suggests majority of
substitutions observed global isolates also present indian
subcontinent. single haplotype observed major haplotype among
isolates delhi, nadiad, chennai panna except isolates kamrup.
further, population comparison analyses suggest p. vivax isolates inhabiting
in north-eastern region (kamrup) distantly related isolates from
remaining parts country. majority amino acid substitutions observed
in indian isolates identical substitutions reported from
isolates thailand bangladesh.
conclusion: study uncovered many new amino acid substitutions well a
predominance single haplotype indian subcontinent except north-eastern
region country. amino acid substitutions data generated study 
from different geographical regions indian subcontinent could helpful
in designing effective anti-malarial transmission-blocking vaccine.
