drug efficacy trials monitor continued efficacy front-line drugs against
falciparum malaria. overestimating efficacy results country retaining a
failing drug first-line treatment associated increases morbidity and
mortality, underestimating drug effectiveness leads removal an
effective treatment substantial practical economic implications. trials 
are challenging: require long durations follow-up detect drug
failures, patients frequently reinfected period. molecular
correction based parasite genotypes distinguishes reinfections drug
failures ensure accuracy failure rate estimates. several molecular
correction "algorithms" proposed, accurate and/or
robust remains unknown. used pharmacological modeling simulate parasite
dynamics genetic signals occur patients enrolled malaria drug
clinical trials. compared estimates treatment failure obtained a
selection proposed molecular correction algorithms known "true"
failure rate model. findings follows. (i) molecular correction 
is essential avoid substantial overestimates drug failure rates. (ii) the
current who-recommended algorithm consistently underestimates true failure
rate. (iii) newly proposed algorithms produce accurate failure rate
estimates; accurate algorithm depends choice drug, trial
follow-up length, transmission intensity. (iv) long durations patient
follow-up may counterproductive; large numbers new infections accumulate
and may misclassified, overestimating drug failure rate. (v) model was
highly consistent existing vivo data. current who-recommended method 
for molecular correction analysis clinical trials reevaluated
and updated.
