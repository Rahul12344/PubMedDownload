neanderthals contributed genetic material modern humans via multiple admixture
events. initial admixture events presumably occurred western asia shortly
after humans migrated africa. despite focal point admixture,
earlier studies indicate lower neanderthal introgression rates western
asian populations compared eurasian populations. better
understand genome-wide phenotypic impact neanderthal introgression 
the region, sequenced whole genomes nine present-day europeans, africans,
and western asian druze high depth, analyzed available whole genome
data various populations, including 16 genomes present-day
turkey. results confirmed previous observations contemporary western
asian populations, average, lower levels neanderthal-introgressed
dna relative eurasian populations. modern western asians also show
comparatively high variability neanderthal ancestry, may attributed
to complex demographic history region. replicated the
previously described depletion putatively functional sequences among
neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes. still, find dozens common
neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes turkish sample associated human
phenotypes, including anthropometric metabolic traits, well immune 
response. one haplotypes unusually long harbors variants that
affect expression members ccr gene family associated with
celiac disease. overall, results paint complex first picture genomic
impact neanderthal introgression western asian populations.
