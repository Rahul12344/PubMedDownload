development vaccine plasmodium falciparum infection urgent
priority particularly widespread resistance traditionally used
drugs. multiple evidences point apical membrane antigen-1(ama-1) prime
vaccine candidate directed p. falciparum asexual blood-stages. gain
understanding genetic demographic forces shaping parasite sequence
diversity kolkata, part pfama-1 gene covering domain-i sequenced from
100 blood samples malaria patients. statistical phylogenetic analyses of
the sequences performed using dnasp mega. high haplotype diversity 
was detected nucleotide (0.998±0.002) amino-acid (0.996±0.001)
levels. abundance low frequency polymorphisms (tajima's d=-1.190, fu & li's
d(∗) f(∗)=-3.068 -2.722), unimodal mismatch distribution star-like 
median-joining network ama-1 haplotypes indicated recent population
expansion among kolkata parasites. high minimum number recombination
events (rm=26) significantly high dn/ds 3.705 (p<0.0001) kolkata
suggested recombination positive selection major forces generation 
and maintenance ama-1 allelic diversity. evaluate impact observed
non-synonymous substitutions context ama-1 functionality, patchdock and
firedock protein-protein interaction solutions mapped pfama-1-pfron2
and pfama-1-host ignar. alterations desolvation global energies of
pfama-1-pfron2 interaction complexes hotspot contact residues were
observed together redistribution surface electrostatic potentials 
variant alleles respect referent pf3d7 sequence. finally, comparison of
p. falciparum subpopulations five indian regional isolates retrieved from
genbank revealed significant level genetic differentiation (fst=0.084-0.129)
with respect kolkata sequences. collectively, results indicated very
high allelic haplotype diversity, high recombination rate signature
of natural selection favoring accumulation non-synonymous substitutions that
facilitated pfama-1-pfron2 interaction hence parasite growth kolkata
clinical isolates.
