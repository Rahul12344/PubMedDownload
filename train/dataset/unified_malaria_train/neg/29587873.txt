background: phlebotomus papatasi sand flies major vectors leishmania major
and phlebovirus infection north africa across middle east the
indian subcontinent. population genetics valuable tool understanding 
level genetic variability present vector populations, vector competence,
and development novel control strategies. study investigated the
genetic differentiation p. papatasi populations egypt jordan 
inhabit distinct ecotopes compared structure p. papatasi populations 
from broader geographical range.
methods: 461 base pair (bp) fragment mtdna cytochrome b (cyt b) gene
was pcr amplified sequenced 116 individual female sand flies aswan 
and north sinai, egypt, well swaimeh malka, jordan. haplotypes were
identified used generate median-joining network, f st values and
isolation-by-distance also evaluated. additional sand fly individuals from
afghanistan, iran, israel, jordan, libya, tunisia turkey included as
well previously published haplotypes provide geographically broad genetic
variation analysis.
results: thirteen haplotypes displaying nine variant sites identified from
p. papatasi collected egypt jordan. private haplotypes identified 
from samples north sinai, egypt, two observed aswan, egypt, four 
swaimeh, jordan two malka, jordan. jordan populations clustered
separately egypt populations produced private haplotypes than
those egypt. pairwise f st values fall range 0.024-0.648.
conclusion: clustering patterns pairwise f st values indicate strong
differentiation egyptian jordanian populations, although this
population structure due isolation-by-distance. factors, 
environmental influences genetic variability circulating le. major
parasites, could possibly contribute heterogeneity. present study
aligns previous reports pockets genetic differentiation exists
between populations widely dispersed species but, overall, species
remains relatively homogeneous.
