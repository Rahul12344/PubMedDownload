the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum replicates intraerythrocytic
parasitophorous vacuole (pv). abundant p. falciparum pv protein, called 
sera5, essential blood stages possesses papain-like domain, prompting
speculation functions proteolytic enzyme. unusually however, sera5
possesses ser residue (ser596) position canonical catalytic cys
of papain-like proteases, function sera5 whether performs an
enzymatic role unknown. study, failed detect proteolytic
activity associated ser596-containing parasite-derived recombinant
protein. however, substitution ser596 cys residue produced active
recombinant enzyme characteristics cysteine protease, demonstrating
that sera5 bind peptides. using targeted homologous recombination in
p. falciparum, substituted ser596 ala phenotypic consequences,
proving sera5 perform essential enzymatic role parasite. 
we could also replace internal segment sera5 affinity-purification 
tag. contrast, using almost identical targeting constructs, could not
truncate c-terminally tag sera5 gene, replace ser596 bulky arg
residue. findings show sera5 plays indispensable non-enzymatic
role p. falciparum blood-stage life cycle.
