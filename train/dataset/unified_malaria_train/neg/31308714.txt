purpose: effective routine monitoring surveillance parasite genes a
necessary strategy control parasites' resistance antimalarial drugs,
according who's recommendation. cross-sectional study therefore aimed
at carrying epidemiological analysis malaria incidence ado-odo/ota, 
ogun state. patients methods: blood corresponding saliva samples were
collected 1,243 subjects ages sex presenting fever a
parasitemia level â‰¥2,000 september 2016 march 2018. samples were
collected selected health facilities study area ogun state to
establish prevalence falciparum malaria determine resistance genes
harbored parasites. overall prevalence falciparum malaria the
study site microscopic examination 45.86%. highest incidence 57.42%
was recorded among male subjects. point mutations k76t n86y pfcrt
and pfmdr-1 genes, well non-synonymous mutations pfk13 genes, were
screened sequenced analysis. results: pfcrt detectable in
57.42% blood 51.02% saliva samples, respectively. 34.78% the
subjects confirmed microscopically harbored pfmdr-1 mutated gene
while 26.67% saliva samples revealed pfmdr-1. epidemiological studies
identified presence wild-type pfk13 genes 21.84% blood 44.44% of
saliva samples correspondingly. genes evaluated, saliva portrayed
great diagnostic performance compared blood. conclusion: findings 
this study established prevalence malaria resistance pattern 
of p. falciparum study area. findings may help formulating drug
policies suggest use saliva noninvasive point-of-care method of
diagnosing malaria potentially deployable rural endemic areas.
