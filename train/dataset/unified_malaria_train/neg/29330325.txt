malarial infection naive individuals induces robust innate immune response. 
in recently described model innate immune memory, initial stimulus
primes innate immune system either hyperrespond (termed training) or
hyporespond (tolerance) subsequent immune challenge. previous work both
mice humans demonstrated infection malaria serve a
priming stimulus promote tolerance subsequent infection. study, we
demonstrate initial stimulation plasmodium falciparum-infected rbcs 
the malaria crystal hemozoin induced human adherent pbmcs hyperrespond to
subsequent ligation tlr2. hyperresponsiveness correlated increased
h3k4me3 important immunometabolic promoters, epigenetic
modifications also seen kenyan children naturally infected malaria. 
however, use epigenetic metabolic inhibitors indicated the
induction trained immunity malaria ligands may occur via a
previously unrecognized mechanism(s).
