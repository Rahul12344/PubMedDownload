the feasibility sterile insect technique (sit) malaria vector control
strategy anopheles arabiensis investigation past 
decade. one critical steps required application technique 
to mosquito control availability efficient effective
sex-separation system. sex-separation systems eliminate female mosquitoes from
the production line prior irradiation field release sterile males. this
is necessary female mosquitoes transmit pathogens malaria
and, therefore, release must prevented. sex separation also increases
the efficiency sit programme. various sex-separation strategies been
explored including exploitation developmental behavioural differences 
between male female mosquitoes, genetic approaches. are
however species-specific indicated major african malaria
vectors an. arabiensis. currently reliable sex-separation 
method an. arabiensis, various strategies explored attempt to
develop robust system applied mass-rearing scale. progress
and challenges faced development sexing system future pilot
and/or large-scale sit release programmes an. arabiensis reviewed
here. three methods sex separation examined. first use of
pupal size gender prediction. second elimination blood-feeding 
adult females addition endectocide blood meal source. 
third establishment genetic sexing strain (gss) carrying an
insecticide resistance selectable marker (dieldrin-resistance rdl gene and/or
other gaba receptor antagonists used alternative insecticides to
dieldrin) temperature-sensitive lethal marker.
