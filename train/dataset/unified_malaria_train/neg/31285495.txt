the zoonotic plasmodium knowlesi parasite common cause human
malaria malaysia. genetic analysis shown parasites divided
into three subpopulations according geographic origin (peninsular or
borneo) and, borneo, macaque host (macaca fascicularis m.
nemestrina). whilst evidence suggests genetic exchange events occurred 
between two borneo subpopulations, picture unclear less studied
peninsular strains. one difficulty p. knowlesi infected individuals tend 
to present low parasitaemia leading samples insufficient dna for
whole genome sequencing. here, using parasite selective whole genome
amplification approach unprocessed blood samples, able analyse
recent genomes sourced peninsular malaysia borneo. analysis
provides evidence recombination events present peninsular
malaysia parasite subpopulation, acquired fragments m.
nemestrina associated subpopulation genotype, including dbpÎ² nbpxa
erythrocyte invasion genes. nbpxb invasion gene also exchanged
within macaque host-associated subpopulations malaysian borneo. work
provides strong evidence exchange events far ubiquitous than
expected taken consideration studying highly complex 
p. knowlesi population structure.
