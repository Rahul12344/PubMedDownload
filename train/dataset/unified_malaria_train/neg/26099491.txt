network-based gene prediction plasmodium falciparum malaria towards
genetics-based drug discovery.

chen y, xu r.

background: malaria deadly parasitic infectious disease. existing
drug treatments limited efficacy malaria elimination, complex
pathogenesis disease fully understood. detecting novel
malaria-associated genes contributes revealing disease
pathogenesis, also facilitates discovering new targets anti-malaria
drugs.
methods: study, developed network-based approach predict
malaria-associated genes. constructed cross-species network integrate
human-human, parasite-parasite human-parasite protein interactions. we
extended random walk algorithm network, used known malaria genes 
as seeds find novel candidate genes malaria.
results: validated algorithms using 77 known malaria genes: 14 human genes
and 63 parasite genes ranked averagely within top 2% top 4%,
respectively among human parasite genomes. also evaluated method for
predicting novel malaria genes using set 27 genes literature supporting
evidence. approach ranked 12 genes within top 1% 24 genes within top 5%. 
in addition, demonstrated top-ranked candied genes enriched drug
targets, identified commonalities underlying top-ranked malaria genes through
pathway analysis. summary, candidate malaria-associated genes predicted by
our data-driven approach potential guide genetics-based anti-malaria 
drug discovery.
