the heme-containing enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (ido-1) ido-2
catalyze conversion essential amino acid tryptophan kynurenine.
metabolites kynurenine pathway ido involved immunity and
the pathology several diseases, either immunoregulatory or
antimicrobial effects. ido-1 plays central role pathogenesis cerebral
malaria, severe often fatal neurological complication of
infection plasmodium falciparum. mouse models usually used study 
underlying pathophysiology. study, screened natural compound library
against mouse ido-1 identified 8-aminobenzo[b]quinolizinium (compound 2c) 
be inhibitor ido-1 potency nanomolar concentrations (50% inhibitory
concentration, 164 nm). twenty-one structurally modified derivatives compound 
2c synthesized structure-activity relationship analyses. compounds
were found selective ido-1 ido-2. therefore compared roles 
of prominent amino acids catalytic mechanisms two isoenzymes via
homology modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic analyses. notably,
methionine 385 ido-2 identified interfere entrance of
l-tryptophan active site enzyme, explains selectivity 
the inhibitors. interestingly, several benzo[b]quinolizinium derivatives (6 
compounds 50% effective concentration values 2.1 6.7 nm) were
found highly effective p. falciparum 3d7 blood stages cell
culture mechanism independent ido-1 inhibition. believe the
class compounds presented unique characteristics; combines the
inhibition mammalian ido-1 strong antiparasitic activity, two features
that offer potential drug development.
