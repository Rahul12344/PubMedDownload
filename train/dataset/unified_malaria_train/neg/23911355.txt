mosquitoes vectors major human diseases, malaria, dengue yellow
fever. efficient treatments vaccines available of
these diseases, control measures rely mainly reducing mosquito populations 
the use insecticides. numerous biotic abiotic factors known to
modulate efficacy insecticides used mosquito control. mosquito breeding
sites vary opened high vegetation covered areas leading large
ultraviolet gradient exposure. ecological feature may affect general
physiology insect, including resistance status insecticides.
in context contrasted breeding sites, assessed impact of
low-energetic ultraviolet exposure mosquito sensitivity biological and
chemical insecticides. show several mosquito detoxification enzyme
activities (cytochrome p450, glutathione s-transferases, esterases) were
increased upon low-energy uv-a exposure. additionally, five specific genes
encoding detoxification enzymes (cyp6bb2, cyp6z7, cyp6z8, gstd4, gste2)
previously shown involved resistance chemical insecticides found
over-transcribed uv-a exposed mosquitoes, revealed rt-qpcr experiments.
more importantly, toxicological bioassays revealed uv-exposed mosquitoes
were tolerant four main chemical insecticide classes (ddt, imidacloprid, 
permethrin, temephos), whereas bioinsecticide bacillus thuringiensis subsp.
israelensis (bti) appeared toxic. present article provides first
experimental evidence capacity low-energy uv-a increase mosquito
tolerance major chemical insecticides. also first time a
metabolic resistance chemical insecticides linked higher
susceptibility bioinsecticide. results support use bti an
efficient alternative chemical insecticides metabolic resistance to
chemicals developed mosquitoes.
