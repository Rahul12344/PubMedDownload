the malaria treatment recommended world health organization involves
medicines derived artemisinin, active compound extracted plant
artemisia annua, derivatives, artesunate. considering the
lack data regarding genotoxic effects compounds human cells,
the objective study evaluate cytotoxicity genotoxicity,
and expressions casp3 sod1 genes cultured human hepatocellular
liver carcinoma cell line (hepg2 cells) treated artemisinin artesunate. 
we tested concentrations 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 20 μg/ml substances with
a resazurin cytotoxicity assay, concentrations used genotoxicity
experiments (2.5, 5, 10 μg/ml) gene expression analysis (5 μg/ml) were
determined. results comet assay cells treated artemisinin 
artesunate showed significant dose-dependent increase (p < 0.001) number
of cells dna damage concentrations tested. however, gene
expression analysis revealed significant change expression casp3 or
sod1. data showed although artemisinin artesunate exhibited
genotoxic effects cultured hepg2 cells, significantly alter
expression casp3 sod1 genes doses tested.
