most febrile patients often misdiagnosed malaria due similar
symptoms, fever shared malaria certain arboviral infections. 
study surveyed incidence malaria, chikungunya dengue infections among 
a number suspected febrile patients visiting simawa health centre, ogun state,
nigeria. venous blood samples obtained 60 febrile patients (age 3-70
years) visiting centre april may 2014. rapid diagnostic test 
(rdt) used detect presence chikungunya (chk) antibodies (igm),
dengue (den) virus antibodies (ns1, igm igg) malaria parasites
(plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax). malarial confirmatory tests by
microscopy nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using polymorphic
region glutamate-rich protein (glurp) gene. complexity p. falciparum
infection community also determined use nested pcr. three 
mosquito-borne infections observed 63% (38) patients. the
prevalence chk, den malarial infections singularly 11%, 0% 63%,
respectively, whereas malaria either chk den infections 24% (9) 
3% (1), respectively. subjects positive chk den co-infection.
malarial microscopic confirmation 94% (32) malaria rdt-positive
samples, 50% (17) successfully analysed nested pcr mean
multiplicity infection 1.6 (1-3 clones). one patient sample harboured both
p. falciparum p. vivax. study reports presence arboviral
infections similar symptoms malaria simawa, ogun state. proper
diagnosis infectious diseases important controlling them.
