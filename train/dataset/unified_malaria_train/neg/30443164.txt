the artemisinin-based combined therapy (act) post-treatment illness plasmodium
falciparum-endemic areas characterized vague malaria-like symptoms. the
roles treatment modality, persistence parasites host proinflammatory
response disease course unknown. investigated hypothesis act
post-treatment syndrome driven parasite genetic polymorphisms and
proinflammatory response persisting mutant parasites. patients were
categorized treated, untreated malaria-negative. malaria positive samples 
were analyzed pfcrt, pfmdr1, k13 kelch gene polymorphisms, samples 
were evaluated cytokines (tnf-α, il-12p70, il-10, tgf-β, ifn-γ) and
corticosteroids (cortisol dexamethasone) levels. treated patients
exhibited higher levels parasitemia, tnf-α, cortisol, increased incidence 
of parasite genetic mutations, greater number mutant alleles per patient. 
in addition, corticosteroid levels declined increasing number mutant
alleles. tgf-β levels negatively correlated parasitemia, il-10
and tgf-β negatively correlated increasing number mutant alleles.
however, il-12 displayed slight positive correlation tnf-α exhibited moderate
positive correlation increasing number mutant alleles. since
post-treatment management ultimately results patient recovery, high
parasite gene polymorphism may act concert induced cortisol tnf-α 
account act post-treatment syndrome.
