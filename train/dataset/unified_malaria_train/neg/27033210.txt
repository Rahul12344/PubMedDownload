iron-sulfur (fe-s) clusters utilized prosthetic groups living
organisms diverse range cellular processes including electron transport in
respiration photosynthesis, sensing ambient conditions, regulation gene
expression catalysis. plasmodium, two fe-s cluster biogenesis pathways are
reported, suf pathway apicoplast shown essential for
the erythrocytic stages parasite. initial components this
pathway detailing sulfur mobilization elucidated, components
required assembly transfer fe-s clusters reported the
parasite. escherichia coli, sufb acts scaffold protein sufa traffics 
the assembled fe-s cluster sufb target apo-proteins. however, in
plasmodium, homologs proteins yet characterized 
function. here, report putative sufa protein plasmodium vivax with
signature motifs a-type scaffold proteins, evolutionarily conserved. 
the presence [fe4s4](3+) cluster reduced conditions confirmed by
uv-visible epr spectroscopy interaction clusters the
conserved cysteine residues chains b pvsufa, validates existence 
as dimer, similar e. coli. h-bond interactions the
pvsufa-sufb interface demonstrate sufa scaffold protein conjunction 
sufb pre-assembly fe-s clusters transfer target
proteins. co-localization protein apicoplast provides an
experimental evidence functional scaffold protein sufa biogenesis of
fe-s clusters apicoplast plasmodium.
