background: reversal chloroquine (cq) resistance following period of
withdrawal raised possibility re-introduction. study
evaluated current prevalence pfcrt pfmdr1 alleles plasmodium
falciparum isolates, 11 years cq withdrawal southeast nigeria.
methods: filter-paper blood samples collected 725 non-febrile
individuals, comprising 250 children (≤ 12 years), 250 pregnant women 225
other adults, october 2014 february 2015 nnewi town, southeast
nigeria. nested pcr followed direct sequencing employed genotyping
of pfcrt pfmdr1 genes.
results: total 103 parasites-positive samples recovered, comprising 
48 (19.20%) among children, 20 (20.00%) among pregnant women 35 (15.50%)
among adults cohort. frequency mutant genotype pfcrt 76t, 75e
and 74i 94.50% each. parasite isolates children frequency 100% 
for mutant alleles pfcrt codons isolates pregnant women and
other adults frequency 91% codons. haplotype distribution of
pfcrt gene 5.45, 0.00 76.37% cvmnk, svmnt cviet, respectively.
for pfmdr1 gene, frequency 86y, 184f 1246y mutant alleles 8.54,
29.27 3.66%, respectively. amongst pfmdr1 haplotypes analysed, nfd had
the highest frequency 24.4%, followed yfd 6.10%. nyf nyy occurred
the least (1.20%).
conclusion: high level pfcrt mutations suggestive sustained cq
pressure p. falciparum isolates study area, despite change first
line treatment cq artemisinin combination therapy 11 years. new
strategy ensure complete withdrawal cq country recommended.
