in recent years, plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 gene deletion has
been reported india. isolates prone selective transmission and
thus form challenge case management. rapid malaria diagnostic
tests based detection hrp2 protein blood, attempted to
use glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) biomarker diagnosis p.
falciparum. recombinant pfgdh successfully cloned, expressed purified
using ni-nta approach. polyclonal antibodies raised full-length 
rpfgdh peptides. antibodies rpfgdh showed strong immune response
against recombinant protein. however, antibody showed affinity towards the
peptides, suggests failed antigen. antibodies rpfgdh
significantly detected gdh human blood specimens. first report
where p. falciparum gdh detected malaria cases various parts of
india. raised polyclonal antibodies shown affinity pfgdh in
quantitative elisa capable exploited rdts. research needs 
further statistical validation large number different sample types 
candidates infected p. falciparum species.
