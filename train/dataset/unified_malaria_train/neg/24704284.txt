duffy binding protein (dbp) leading vaccine candidate plasmodium vivax.
the binding domain dbp (dbp-ii) polymorphic, may major challenge 
for development broadly effective vaccine vivax malaria. present
investigation undertaken explore whether sequence diversity dbp-ii 
causes variation naturally acquired anti-dbp-ii antibodies. study, the
five genetically distinct variants expressed, anti-dbp-ii responses were
measured p. vivax-infected individuals (n=202). finally, performing
immune-depletion elisa experiments, antibody responses conserved sites 
all allelic forms evaluated using corresponding non-corresponding
patients' sera (n=20). study, natural p. vivax infection produces igg
against five examined variant forms pvdbp-ii statistically
difference. sequence analysis 20 selected samples (for antibody depletion 
experiment) showed eight distinct haplotypes, dbpi (n=1), dbpiii (n=3), dbpiv
(n=1), dbpv (n=1), dbpvi (n=5), dbpix (n=6), dbpx (n=1), dbp xi (n=2). the
results showed presence cross-reactive antibody responses to
heterologous variants pvdbp-ii iranian individuals infected with
distinct allelic forms pvdbp-ii. therefore, proposed the
majority antibodies recognized sharing b-cell epitopes could overcome
the pvdbp-ii variation one biggest challenges pvdbp-ii-based
vaccine development.
