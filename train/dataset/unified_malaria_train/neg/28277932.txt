this review focuses role trans-kingdom movement small rna (srna)
molecules parasites, particularly plasmodium falciparum, their
respective host cells. intercellular transfer srnas within organisms
is well recognized, recent studies illustrate many examples trans-kingdom srna
exchange within context host-parasite interactions. interactions are
predominantly found transfer host srnas erythrocytes the
invading p. falciparum, well host cell types. addition,
parasite-encoded srnas also transferred host cells evade immune 
system. transport parasite srnas body fluids host may 
also offer means detect monitor parasite infection. isolated
examples may represent tip iceberg transfer srna 
between host parasites critical aspect host-pathogen interactions. in
addition, levels srnas speed transfer may vary
dramatically different contexts push biologic equilibrium toward the
benefit hosts vs. parasites. therefore, srna transfers may offer
potential strategies detect, prevent treat parasite infections. here, we
review brief history discovery host erythrocyte srnas, their
transfers interactions context p. falciparum infection. also
provide examples discuss functional significance reciprocal
transfer parasite-encoded srnas hosts. understandings srna
exchanges put context implications parasite pathogenesis,
host defenses evolution host polymorphisms driven host interactions
with parasites.
