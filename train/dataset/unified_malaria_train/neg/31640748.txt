a major advance antimalarial drug discovery shift towards
cell-based phenotypic screening, notable progress screening of
compounds asexual blood stage, liver stage, gametocytes. a
primary method drug target deconvolution plasmodium falciparum vitro
evolution compound-resistant parasites followed whole-genome scans. several
of promising antimalarial drug targets, translation elongation
factor 2 (eef2) phenylalanine trna synthetase (phers), identified
or confirmed using method. one drawback method mutated 
gene uncharacterized, substantial effort may required determine
whether drug target, drug resistance gene, mutation merely
a background mutation. thus, availability high-throughput, functional
genomic datasets greatly assist target deconvolution. studies mapping
genome-wide essentiality p. falciparum performing transcriptional profiling
of host parasite liver-stage infection p. berghei have
identified potentially druggable pathways. advances mapping epigenomic
regulation malaria parasite genome also enabled identification of
key processes involved parasite development. addition, examination of
the host genome infection identified novel gene candidates associated 
with susceptibility severe malaria. here, review recent studies have
used omics-based methods identify novel targets interventions against
protozoan parasites, focusing malaria, highlight advantages and
limitations approaches used. approaches also extended to
other protozoan pathogens, including toxoplasma, trypanosoma, leishmania
spp., studies highlight drug discovery efforts these
pathogens benefit utilization diverse omics-based methods identify
promising drug targets.
