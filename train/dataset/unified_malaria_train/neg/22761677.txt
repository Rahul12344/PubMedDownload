background: mitochondrial genome human malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum unusual. half genome composed genes for
three classic mitochondrial proteins: cytochrome oxidase subunits iii and
apocytochrome b. remainder encodes numerous small rnas, ranging size 
23 190 nt. previous analysis revealed transcripts have
significant sequence identity highly conserved regions large small
subunit rrnas, form expected secondary structures. however, these
rrna fragments encoded linear order; instead, intermixed with
one another protein coding genes, coded strands the
genome. unorthodox arrangement hindered identification transcripts
corresponding regions rrna highly conserved and/or known
to participate directly protein synthesis.
principal findings: identification 14 additional small mitochondrial
transcripts p. falciparum assignment 27 small rnas (12 ssu rnas
totaling 804 nt, 15 lsu rnas totaling 1233 nt) specific regions rrna are
supported multiple lines evidence. regions represented highly
similar small contiguous mitochondrial rrnas of
caenorhabditis elegans. p. falciparum rrna fragments cluster the
interfaces two ribosomal subunits three-dimensional structure of
the ribosome.
significance: rrna fragments presumed identified 
with experimental methods, nearly mapped onto ssu 
and lsu rrnas. conversely, regions rrnas known directly
associated protein synthesis identified p. falciparum
mitochondrial genome rna transcripts. fragmentation rrna p.
falciparum mitochondrion extreme example rrna fragmentation
discovered.
