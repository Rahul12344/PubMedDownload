linear amplification deep sequencing (lads) amplification method that
produces representative libraries illumina next-generation sequencing within 
2 d. method relies attaching two different sequencing adapters to
blunt-end repaired a-tailed dna fragments, wherein one adapters is
extended sequence t7 rna polymerase promoter. ligated and
size-selected dna fragments transcribed vitro high rna yields.
subsequent cdna synthesis initiated primer complementary first
adapter, ensuring library contain full-length fragments with
two distinct adapters. contrary severely biased representation at- or
gc-rich fragments standard pcr-amplified libraries, sequence coverage in
t7-amplified libraries indistinguishable nonamplified libraries. 
moreover, contrast amplification-free methods, lads generate sequencing
libraries nanograms dna, essential applications in
which starting material limited.
