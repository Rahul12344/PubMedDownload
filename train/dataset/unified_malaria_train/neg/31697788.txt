mating causes dramatic changes female physiology, behaviour, immunity in
many insects, inducing oogenesis, oviposition, refractoriness further
mating. females anopheles gambiae species complex typically mate only
once lifetime receive sperm seminal fluid proteins
as well mating plug contains steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone.
this hormone, also induced blood-feeding, plays major role in
activating vitellogenesis egg production. show female anopheles 
coluzzii susceptibility plasmodium falciparum infection significantly
higher mated females compared virgins. also find mating status 
a major impact midgut transcriptome, detectable sugar-fed
conditions: females blood-fed, transcriptional changes are
induced mating likely masked widespread effects blood-feeding on
gene expression. determine whether increased susceptibility parasites could
be driven additional 20e mated females receive males, we
mimicked mating injecting virgin females 20e, finding females 
are significantly susceptible human malaria parasites virgin females
injected control 20e carrier. rnaseq carried examine 
whether genes change upon 20e injection midgut similar to
those change upon mating. find 79 midgut-expressed genes are
regulated common mating 20e, 96% (n = 76) are
regulated direction (up vs 20e/mated). together, these
findings show male anopheles mosquitoes induce changes female midgut 
that affect female susceptibility p. falciparum. implies in
nature, males might contribute malaria transmission previously
unappreciated ways, vector control strategies target males may have
additional benefits towards reducing transmission.
