this study investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) detection
of plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax urine saliva malaria
patients. may november 2011, 108 febrile patients referred health
centers sistan baluchestan province south-eastern iran participated 
the study. saliva, urine, blood samples analyzed nested pcr and
lamp targeting species-specific nucleotide sequence small subunit
ribosomal rna gene (18s rrna) p. falciparum p. vivax evaluated for
diagnostic accuracy comparison blood nested pcr assay. nested pcr of
blood used standard, microscopy nested pcr saliva urine samples 
showed sensitivity 97.2%, 89.4% 71% specificity 100%, 97.3% and
100%, respectively. lamp sensitivity blood, saliva, urine 95.8%, 47%
and 29%, respectively, whereas lamp specificity samples 100%.
microscopy nested pcr saliva lamp blood comparable nested
pcr blood (к=0.95, 0.83, 0.94, respectively), agreement nested pcr
of urine moderate (к=0.64) poor fair saliva lamp urine lamp
(к=0.38 0.23, respectively). lamp assay showed low sensitivity detection 
of plasmodium dna human saliva urine compared results blood to
nested pcr blood, saliva, urine. however, considering advantages of
lamp technology saliva urine sampling, research the
method worthwhile. lamp protocol precise preparation protocols need 
defined optimized template dna saliva urine.
