trichomes, small protrusions surface many plant species, produce
and store various secondary metabolic products. artemisinin, famous 
potent medicine malaria, synthesized, stored, secreted artemisia
annua trichomes. however, molecular basis regulating biosynthesis of
artemisinin development trichomes a. annua remains poorly
understood. here, report ap2 transcription factor, trichome and
artemisinin regulator 1 (tar1), plays crucial roles regulating development
of trichomes biosynthesis artemisinin a. annua. tar1, encodes
a protein specially located nucleus, mainly expressed young leaves, 
flower buds, trichomes. tar1-rnai lines, morphology trichomes 
and composition cuticular wax altered, artemisinin content
was dramatically reduced, could significantly increased tar1
oeverexpression. expression levels several key genes involved in
artemisinin biosynthesis altered tar1 silenced overexpressed. by
the electrophoretic mobility shift, yeast one-hybrid transient transformation
β-glucuronidase assays, showed ads cyp71av1, two key genes the
biosynthesis pathway artemisinin, likely direct targets tar1. taken
together, results indicate tar1 key component molecular
network regulating trichome development artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua.
