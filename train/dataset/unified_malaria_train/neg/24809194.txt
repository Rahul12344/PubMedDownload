objective: compare laboratory tests imported plasmodium ovale
infection analyse genetic character.
methods: giemsa staining microscopy, carestart rapid detection and
nested pcr used detect two cases p. ovale infection returning from
congo (brazzaville) henan province. sequencing performed pcr
amplification using 18s rrna genus-specific primers. genetic
characteristics analyzed sequence homology analysis performed in
the ncbi.
results: two cases confirmed p. ovale infection morphological
examination microscopically. amplified bands produced 18s rrna nested
pcr, p. ovale size, whereas results carestart
rapid detection test negative. sequence 906 bp length was
obtained sequencing 18s rrna genes gc accounted 35.4%, 
the sequence showed 99% homology corresponding part known p. ovale 
18s rrna gene (genbank accession no. ab182492).
conclusion: nested pcr microscopy confirm infection p. ovale.
a negative result carestart rapid detection ruled plasmodium
infection.
