in remote areas malaria-endemic countries, rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) 
dramatically improved parasitological confirmation suspected malaria cases,
especially skilled microscopists available. study designed 
to determine frequency plasmodium falciparum isolates histidine-rich 
protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene deletion one possible factors contributing to
the failure pfhrp2-based rdts detecting malaria. total 300 blood
samples collected several health centres nyala city, western sudan. 
the performance pfhrp2-based rdts relation microscopy examined and
the pcr-confirmed samples investigated presence pfhrp2 gene. a
total 113 300 patients p. falciparum positive microscopy. among
them, 93.81% (106 113) positives pfhrp2 rdts. seven isolates
were identified false negative basis rdts results. one
isolate (0.9%; 1/113) potentially pfhrp2 gene deletion. sensitivity and
specificity pfhrp2-based rdts 93.81% 100%, respectively. results 
provide insights pfhrp2 gene deletion amongst p. falciparum population
from sudan. however, studies large systematic collection 
different geographical settings across country needed.
