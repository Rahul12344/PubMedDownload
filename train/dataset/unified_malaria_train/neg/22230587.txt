sera5 regarded promising malaria vaccine candidate virulent
human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. sera5 120 kda abundantly
expressed blood-stage protein containing papain-like protease. since
substantial polymorphism blood-stage vaccine candidates may potentially limit 
their efficacy, imperative fully investigate polymorphism sera5
gene (sera5). study, performed evolutionary population genetic
analysis sera5. level inter-species divergence (ks=0.076) p.
falciparum plasmodium reichenowi, closely related chimpanzee malaria
parasite comparable housekeeping protein genes. signature of
purifying selection detected proenzyme enzyme domains. analysis of
445 near full-length p. falciparum sera5 sequences nine countries africa,
southeast asia, oceania south america revealed extensive variations the
number octamer repeat (or) serine repeat (sr) regions well as
substantial level single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) non-repeat regions
(2562 bp). remarkably, 14 amino acid sequence sera5 (amino acids 59-72) that
is known vitro target parasite growth inhibitory antibodies was
found perfectly conserved 445 worldwide isolates p. falciparum
evaluated. unlike major vaccine target antigen genes merozoite
surface protein-1, apical membrane antigen-1 circumsporozoite protein, no
strong evidence positive selection detected snps non-repeat
regions sera5. biased geographical distribution observed snps well
as haplotypes sera5 sr regions. africa, or- and
sr-haplotypes low frequency (<5%) snps minor allele frequency (<5%)
were abundant mostly continent-specific. consistently, significant
genetic differentiation, assessed wright's fixation index (fst) of
inter-population variance allele frequencies, detected snps both
or- sr-haplotypes among almost parasite populations. exception was
parasite populations tanzania ghana, suggesting frequent gene flow in
africa. present study points importance investigating whether
biased geographical distribution snps repeat variants sr
regions affect reactivity human serum antibodies variants.
