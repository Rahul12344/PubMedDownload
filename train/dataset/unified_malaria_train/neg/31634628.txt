il-27, regulatory cytokine, plays critical roles prevention of
immunopathology plasmodium infection. examined roles the
immune responses plasmodium chabaudi infection using il-27ra-/- mice.
while il-27 expressed high levels early phase infection,
enhanced cd4+ cell function reduction parasitemia observed mainly
during chronic phase mutant mice. mice infected p. chabaudi
and cured drug, cd4+ cells il-27ra-/- mice exhibited enhanced cd4+ 
t-cell responses, indicating inhibitory role il-27 protective
immune responses. determine role il-27 detail, performed cd4+
t-cell transfer experiments. il-27ra-/- il27p28-/- mice first
infected p. chabaudi cured using drug treatment. plasmodium-antigen
primed cd4+ cells prepared mice transferred the
recipient mice, followed infection heterologous parasite p. berghei
anka. il-27ra-/- cd4+ cells infected recipient mice produce
il-10, indicating il-10 production primed cd4+ cells il-27
dependent. il27p28-/- cd4+ cells primed absence il-27
exhibited enhanced recall responses challenge infection p.
berghei anka, implying il-27 receptor signaling primary infection
affects recall responses long-term via regulation memory cd4+ t
cell generation. features highlighted direct time-transcending roles of
il-27 regulation immune responses chronic infection with
plasmodium parasites.
