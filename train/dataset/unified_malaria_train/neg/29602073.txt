background: combinatorial effects plasmodium infection, perturbation of
inflammatory responses dichotomic role tnf promoter polymorphism has
potential clinical physiological relevance pregnancy.
objective methods: coordinated orchestration instigated us to
investigate circulating level inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnf-α and
il-6) employing elisa stratified group samples plausible genetic 
association tnf-α -308 g/a using pcr-rflp/sequencing plasmodium vivax
infection pregnancy.
results: observed significantly elevated concentrations il-1β were
observed, followed il-6 tnf-α women malaria (wwm) malaria
in pregnancy (mip). further, elevated il-1β, followed tnf-α il-6 were
detected non-infected pregnancy group. differential dynamics of
inflammatory cytokine concentration trimester pregnancy and
without p. vivax infection detected. first time, high level of
il-6 observed first trimester mip high il-1β healthy
pregnancies. second trimester, however, observed high level il-1β 
in mip group compared sustained high level il-1β healthy
pregnancy group. third trimester, high il-1β sustained mip
group healthy pregnancies acquired high tnf-α level. genotypic
distribution tnf-α promoter -308 g/a position observed be
nonsignificant mildly associated mip (or = 1.4) wwm (or = 1.2).
moreover, based genotypic distribution, observed well-correlated and
significantly elevated tnf-α concentration mutant homozygote genotype (aa;
p = 0.001) followed heterozygotes (ga; p = 0.0001) ancestral genotypes
(gg; p = 0.0001) mip wwm subjects.
conclusion: observation elevated il-1β il-6 mip tnf-α wwm
may regarded prognostic inflammatory marker infection pregnancy.
most particularly, tnf-α concentration polymorphic variability the
promoter region may indicate genetic susceptibility mildly influence risk
for p. vivax infection pregnancy women malaria.
