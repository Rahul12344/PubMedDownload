background: documentation cases falciparum malaria negative by
rapid diagnostic tests (rdt), though low frequency natural isolates 
small pocket odisha, became absolutely necessary investigate status 
of hrp-2 based rdt throughout state different seasons year.
methods: suspected individuals screened malaria infection microscopy 
and rdt 25/30 districts odisha, india. discrepancies results were
confirmed pcr. false negative rdt samples plasmodium falciparum
mono-infection evaluated detection hrp2 antigen elisa and
genotyped pfhrp2, pfhrp3 flanking genes. multiplicity infection 
was ascertained based msp1 msp2 genotyping parasitaemia level was
determined microscopy.
results: total 1058 patients suspected malaria, 384 were
microscopically confirmed p. falciparum mono-infection rdt failure was
observed 58 samples varying proportion different regions state.
the failure detection due undetectable level hrp-2. although of
these samples screened rainy season (45/345), significantly high
proportion (9/17) rdt negative samples obtained summer
compared rainy season (p = 0.0002; or = 7.5). pcr genotyping pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 rdt negative samples showed 38/58 (65.5) samples pfhrp2 negative 
and 24/58 (41.4) pfhrp3 negative including dual negative 17/58 (29.3).
most rdt negative samples (39/58) single genotype infection 
high proportions pfhrp2 deletion (7/9) observed summer. difference
in parasitaemia level observed rdt positive rdt negative
patients.
conclusion: high prevalence parasites pfhrp2 deletion including dual
deletions (pfhrp2 pfhrp3) serious cause concern, patients
could given correct diagnosis treatment. therefore, hrp2-based rdt
for diagnosing p. falciparum infection odisha non-reliable must be
performed addition replaced appropriate diagnostic tools for
clinical management disease.
