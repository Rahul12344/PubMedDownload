there rapidly growing body evidence production microvesicles
(mvs) universal feature cellular life. mvs incorporate microrna
(mirna), mrna, mtdna, dna retrotransposons, camouflage viruses/viral
components immune surveillance, transfer cargo cells. these
properties make mvs essential player intercellular communication.
increasing evidence supports notion mvs also act long-distance
vehicles rna molecules participate metabolic synchronization and
reprogramming eukaryotic cells including stem germinal cells. mv ability to
carry dna general distribution makes attractive candidates 
horizontal gene transfer, particularly multi-cellular organisms their
parasites; suggests important implications co-evolution parasites
and hosts. review, provide current understanding roles
played mvs intracellular pathogens parasitic infections. also
discuss possible role mvs co-infection host shifting.
