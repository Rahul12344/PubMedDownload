plasmodium parasites express potent inhibitor cysteine proteases (icp)
throughout life cycle. analyze role icp different life cycle
stages, generated stage-specific knockout plasmodium berghei icp
(pbicp). excision pbicb gene occurred infective sporozoites and
resulted impaired sporozoite invasion hepatocytes, despite residual pbicp
protein detectable sporozoites. vast majority parasites
invading cultured hepatocyte cell line develop mature liver stages, 
but successfully developed hepatic merozoites able initiate 
a blood stage infection mice. blood stage parasites, completely
lacking pbicp, exhibited attenuated phenotype able infect
mosquitoes develop oocyst stage. however, pbicp-negative sporozoites
liberated oocysts exhibited defective motility invaded mosquito salivary
glands low numbers. also unable invade hepatocytes, confirming
that control cysteine protease activity critical importance for
sporozoites. importantly, transfection pbicp-knockout parasites a
pbicp-gfp construct fully reversed defects. taken together, p. berghei
this inhibitor icp family essential sporozoite motility also
appears play role parasite development hepatocytes and
erythrocytes.
