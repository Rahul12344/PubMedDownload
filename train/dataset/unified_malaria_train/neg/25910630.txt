background: artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum emerged in
southeast asia poses threat malaria control elimination. mutations
in p. falciparum gene encoding kelch protein chromosome 13 been
associated delayed parasite clearance following artemisinin treatment
elsewhere region, yet china.
methods: therapeutic efficacy studies artesunate and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine conducted 2009 2012 yunnan
province china near border myanmar. k13 mutations genotyped by
capillary sequencing dna extracted dried blood spots collected these
clinical trials routine surveillance. associations k13 mutations
and delayed parasite clearance tested using regression models.
results: parasite clearance half-lives prolonged artemisinin
treatment, 44% infections half-lives >5 hours (n = 109). fourteen 
mutations k13 observed, overall prevalence 47.7% (n = 329). 
single mutation, f446i, predominated, prevalence 36.5%. infections with
f446i significantly associated parasitemia day 3 following
artemisinin treatment longer clearance half-lives.
conclusions: plasmodium falciparum infections southern china displayed
markedly delayed clearance following artemisinin treatment. f446i the
predominant k13 mutation associated delayed parasite clearance.
