background: artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (assp) frontline
artemisinin combination therapy (act) india. random, irrational,
subtherapeutic artemisinin doses self-medication act along with
predominance sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance parasite invoked strong
possibility emerging artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites.
methods: study involved 226 patients uncomplicated plasmodium
falciparum infection successfully completed 42 days follow-up after
assp combination therapy april 2014 january 2016. assessed assp
treatment efficacy evaluating parasite clearance half-life, pfkelch13, and
other (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt) gene mutations survival parasites as
detected ex vivo ring-stage survival assay (rsa).
findings: slow-clearing infections longer parasite clearance half-lives (>5 
hours) observed 12% isolates. cure rate assp treatment was
declining 84.1%. assp failure recorded 15.9% (early treatment
failure, 7.9%; late treatment failure, 7.9%) isolates. sum, 24 patients
(10.6%) parasite clearance half-lives greater 5 hours pfkelch13
polymorphism 441 codon; 15 patients (6.6%), parasites not
cleared 72 hours initiation therapy. median ex vivo ring-stage
survival rate isolates high (12.2%; 95% confidence interval
[ci], 10.9-13.8) cured patients (0.9%; 95% ci, 0.09-1.07). 
15 patients, 13 patients pfkelch13 g625r polymorphism, whereas 2 patients
contained r539t polymorphism. per world health organization guideline,
these 15 isolates true artemisinin-resistant isolates.
interpretation: identification artemisinin-resistant isolates india
together new mutations increasing combination therapy failures blow
alarms urgent malaria control.
