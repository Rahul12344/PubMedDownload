background: vector-borne apicomplexan parasites major cause mortality
and morbidity humans livestock globally. important disease
syndromes caused parasites malaria, babesiosis theileriosis.
strategies control often target parasite stages mammalian host that
cause disease, result reservoir infections promote pathogen 
transmission generate economic loss. optimal control strategies should
protect clinical disease, block transmission applicable across
related genera parasites. used bioinformatics transcriptomics to
screen transmission-blocking candidate antigens tick-borne
apicomplexan parasite, theileria annulata.
results: number candidate antigen genes identified encoded amino 
acid domains conserved across vector-borne apicomplexa (babesia,
plasmodium theileria), including pfs48/45 6-cys domain novel
cysteine-rich domain. expression profiling confirmed selected candidate
genes expressed life cycle stages within infected ticks. additionally,
putative b cell epitopes identified t. annulata gene sequences
encoding 6-cys cysteine rich domains, gene encoding putative
papain-family cysteine peptidase, similarity plasmodium sera family, 
and gene encoding t. annulata major merozoite/piroplasm surface antigen, 
tams1.
conclusions: candidate genes identified encode proteins similarity
to known transmission blocking candidates related parasites, one a
novel candidate conserved across vector-borne apicomplexans potential
role sexual phase life cycle. results indicate 'one
health' approach could utilised develop transmission-blocking strategy
effective vector-borne apicomplexan parasites animals humans.
