entamoeba nuttalli found non-human primates phylogenetically closest
species entamoeba histolytica potentially pathogenic. however,
infection wild long-tailed macaques (macaca fascicularis) e. nuttalli has
not found. study, prevalence entamoeba infections wild
long-tailed macaques examined seven locations six provinces of
thailand. positive rate e. nuttalli 214 fecal samples 43.9% using 
pcr, infection e. histolytica entamoeba dispar found,
demonstrating long-tailed macaque one natural hosts e.
nuttalli. twenty-four e. nuttalli isolates successfully cultured four of
them axenized. sequences 18s ribosomal rna genes e. nuttalli
from long-tailed macaques differed e. nuttalli isolates 
species wild macaques. eleven types sequences serine-rich protein genes 
were identified 24 isolates specific location in
thailand. analysis six trna-linked short tandem repeat loci, isolates
were divided 14 types, type also location-specific.
phylogenetic analysis revealed correlation genotypes parasite 
the geographic distribution host macaques. genetic distance geographic
distance correlated significantly mantel test, r values 0.888 based 
on trna-linked short tandem repeat loci 0.815 based serine-rich
protein genes. results suggest genetic divergence co-evolution 
the parasite occurred dispersion colonization host macaque, and
that genotypic analysis parasite may enable identification the
geographic localization host.
