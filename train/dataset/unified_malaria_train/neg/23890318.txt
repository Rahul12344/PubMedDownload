background: cerebral malaria (cm) caused plasmodium falciparum known 
associated sequestration parasitized red blood cells (prbcs) the
microvasculature release soluble cytokines. addition, the
involvement signaling molecules gained wide interest pathogenesis
of cm. important signaling factor, nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) known 
regulate apoptosis. work aimed study expression nf-κb p65 
correlation apoptosis brain fatal cm.
methods: expression nf-κb p65 cleaved caspase-3 brain fatal 
p. falciparum malaria cases investigated immunohistochemistry.
histopathological features analysed together correlations nf-κb 
p65 cleaved caspase-3 expression.
results: nf-κb p65 activation cleaved caspase-3 expression significantly
increased neurons, glial cells, vascular endothelial cells (ecs) and
intravascular leukocytes brain fatal cm, compared control
brain (p < 0.001) non-cerebral malaria (ncm) (p = 0.034). percentage of
neurons expressed nuclear nf-κb p65 showed positive correlation the
total score histopathological changes (rs = 0.678; p = 0.045). significant
positive correlations established vascular ecs nf-κb index ecs
apoptotic index (rs = 0.717; p = 0.030) intravascular leukocytes
nf-κb index leukocytes apoptotic index (rs = 0.696; p = 0.037) fatal cm.
conclusions: study documented nf-κb p65 one signaling factors
that modulates apoptosis brain ecs intravascular leukocytes fatal
cm.
