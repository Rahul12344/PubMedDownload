repeated stimulation cells occurs context chronic infection
results progressively reduced responsiveness cells pathogen-derived
antigens. phenotype, known cell exhaustion, occurs chronic
infections caused variety pathogens, persistent viruses to
parasites. unlike memory cells typically form successful pathogen 
clearance following acute infection, exhausted cells secrete lower levels of
effector cytokines, proliferate less response cognate antigen, and
upregulate cell surface inhibitory molecules pd-1 lag-3. the
molecular events lead induction phenotype have, however, 
been fully characterized. cells, members nfat family transcription
factors responsible expression many activation-induced
genes also crucial induction transcriptional programs that
inhibit cell activation maintain tolerance. show that
nfat1-deficient cd4+ cells maintain higher proliferative capacity and
expression effector cytokines following plasmodium yoelii infection are
therefore resistant p. yoelii-induced exhaustion wild-type
counterparts. consequently, gene expression microarray analysis cd4+ cells
following p. yoelii-induced exhaustion shows upregulation effector t
cell-associated genes absence nfat1 compared wild-type exhausted t
cells. furthermore, adoptive transfer nfat1-deficient cd4+ cells mice
infected p. yoelii results increased production antibodies cognate 
antigen. results support idea nfat1 necessary fully suppress
effector responses plasmodium-induced cd4+ cell exhaustion.
