t-dna insertion alters terpenoid content composition bioactivity of
transgenic artemisia annua.

in study, interference t-dna insertion upon agrobacterium-mediated
transformation biochemical expression host genome discussed.
plant extracts transgenic artemisia annua l. without overexpressed 
famesyl pyrophosphate synthase gene investigated bioactivity 
and metabolic profile comparison wild type a. annua. highest
antimicrobial activity staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and
candida albicans observed t253 transgenic lines. moreover, crude
extract t253 showed higher antimalarial activity plasmodium
faciparum k1 strain others. terpenoid constituents and
antimicrobial properties plant samples grouped hierarchical
clustering analysis. clustering showed squalene putative compound
that might involved increasing bioactivity transgenic line. in
addition, t253 triterpene content twice great 
the t253-2 line, higher content sesquiterpenes. however, both
lines transformed fps gene. results suggested the
different bioactive properties observed transgenic line may caused 
variations terpenoid composition, affected t-dna insertion
at different positions host plant.
