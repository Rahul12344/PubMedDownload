acquisition elizabethkingia infections intensive care units (icus) has
risen past decade. treatment elizabethkingia infections challenging 
due lack effective therapeutic regimens, leading high mortality
rate. elizabethkingia infections long attributed elizabethkingia
meningoseptica. recently, used whole-genome sequencing reveal e.
anophelis pathogenic agent elizabethkingia outbreak two icus. we
performed comparative genomic analysis seven hospital-isolated e. anophelis
strains five available elizabethkingia spp. genomes deposited the
national center biotechnology information database. pan-genomic approach
was applied identify core- pan-genome elizabethkingia genus.
we showed unlike hospital-isolated pathogen e. meningoseptica atcc 12535
strain, hospital-isolated e. anophelis strains genome content and
organization similar e. anophelis ag1 r26 strains isolated the
midgut microbiota malaria mosquito vector anopheles gambiae. the
core- accessory genomes elizabethkingia spp. possess genes conferring
antibiotic resistance virulence. study highlights e. anophelis an
emerging bacterial pathogen hospital environments.
