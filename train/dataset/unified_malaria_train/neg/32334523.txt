background: plasmodium vivax widely distributed malaria parasite, and
its drug resistance poses unique challenges malaria elimination. greater
mekong subregion (gms) known global epicenter multidrug resistance. 
surveillance molecular markers associated drug resistance area
will help inform drug policy.
methods: dry blood spots 58 patients 109 p. vivax infection
between 2017, december 2019, march obtained yingjiang county,
yunnan province, along china-myanmar border. pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1 and
pvcrt-o amplified sequenced assess gene mutations. polymorphism
and prevalence molecular markers analyzed.
results: mutations pvdhfr codons 57, 58, 61, 99 117 detected in
27.59, 48.28, 27.59, 32.76 48.28% isolates, respectively. single
mutant haplotype (i13f57s58t61s99s117i173) frequent (29.31%, 17/58),
followed double mutant haplotype (20.69%, 12/58). three types tandem
repeat variations pvdhfr, deletion type common. pvdhps showed a
lower prevalence among mutation genotypes. single mutant dominant and
accounted 34.48% (20/58). prevalence pvmdr1 mutations codons 958 and
1076 100.00% 84.48%, respectively. proportion double single
mutant types 84.48% (49/58) 15.52% (9/58), respectively. eleven samples
(18.97%, 11/58) showed k10 "aag" insertion chloroquine resistance transporter 
gene pvcrt-o.
conclusions: moderate diversity molecular patterns resistance
markers pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1 pvcrt-o in imported p. vivax cases to
yingjiang county western yunnan, along china-myanmar border. prevalence
and molecular pattern candidate drug resistance markers pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1
and pvcrt-o demonstrated current study, would help update
drug policy.
