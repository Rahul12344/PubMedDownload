background: plasmodium, high level genetic diversity the
interactions established co-infecting parasite populations within same
host may source selection pathogen virulence drug resistance. as
different patterns already described humans mosquitoes, parasite
diversity population structure studied hosts properly
assess effects infection transmission dynamics. study aimed 
characterize circulating populations plasmodium spp plasmodium
falciparum combined set human blood mosquito samples gathered in
mainland equatorial guinea. further, origin evolution anti-malarial
resistance area, malaria remains major public health problem were
traced.
methods: plasmodium species infecting humans mosquitoes identified by
nested-pcr chelex-extracted dna dried blood spot samples mosquitoes. 
analysis pfmsp2 gene, anti-malarial-resistance associated genes, pfdhps,
pfdhfr, pfcrt pfmdr1, neutral microsatellites (str) loci pfdhfr and
pfdhps flanking str undertaken evaluate p. falciparum diversity.
results: prevalence infection remains high mainland equatorial guinea. no
differences parasite formula significant genetic differentiation seen 
in parasite populations human mosquito samples. point mutations
in genes associated anti-malarial resistance highly prevalent. a
high prevalence observed pfdhfr triple mutant particular,
associated pyrimethamine resistance.analysis pfdhps pfdhfr flanking
str revealed decrease genetic diversity. finding along with
multiple independent introductions pfdhps mutant haplotypes suggest soft
selective sweep increased differentiation pfdhfr flanking
microsatellites hints model positive directional selection gene.
conclusions: chloroquine longer recommended malaria treatment in
equatorial guinea sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) remains use in
combination artesunate drug recommended preventive
chemotherapy pregnancy. high prevalence point mutations pfdhfr and
pfdhps points danger eventual reduction efficacy sp
combined therapy p. falciparum populations equatorial guinea the
essential continuous monitoring two genes.
