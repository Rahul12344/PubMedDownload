annua resulted characterization 80 natural products nmr, more
than 20 novel described first time. analysis of

confirmed latter low level dbr2 (artemisinic aldehyde Î´11(13)
reductase) gene expression. show lap chemotype accumulates high 
levels artemisinic acid, arteannuin b, epi-deoxyarteannuin b other
amorpha-4,11-diene derived sesquiterpenes unsaturated the
11,13-position. contrast, hap chemotype rich sesquiterpenes
saturated 11,13-position (dihydroartemisinic acid, artemisinin and
dihydro-epi-deoxyarteannunin b), consistent higher expression
levels dbr2, also presence hap-chemotype version cyp71av1
(amorpha-4,11-diene c-12 oxidase). results indicate conversion steps
from artemisinic acid arteannuin b, epi-deoxyarteannuin b artemisitene

dhaa artemisinin dihyro-epi-deoxyarteannuin b hap chemotype.
interestingly, artemisinic acid lap chemotype preferentially converts to
arteannuin b rather endoperoxide bridge containing artemisitene. in
contrast, hap chemotype, dhaa preferentially converts artemisinin.
broader metabolomic transcriptomic profiling revealed significantly different
terpenoid profiles related terpenoid gene expression two
morphologically distinct chemotypes.
