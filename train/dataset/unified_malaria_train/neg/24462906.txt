among vaccines, impact transmission priority for
malaria elimination eradication. one new identified
transmission-blocking vaccine (tbv) candidate antigens generative cell
specific 1 (gcs1) located male gametocytes plasmodium species. since
the antigenic diversity could hamper vaccine development, essential to
determine gene diversity gcs1 global malaria-endemic areas order 
develop efficient tbvs. therefore, study, nucleotide diversity and
selection plasmodium falciparum gcs1 (pfgcs1) antigen analyzed 36 
iranian clinical isolates using pcr sequencing order provide useful
information tbv candidate antigen. purpose, successful sequence 
analysis carried 36 isolates. results showed three
single-nucleotide polymorphisms including one synonymous (g1475a) two
non-synonymous (a697g g1479a) mutations leading 3 distinct haplotypes with
different frequencies: gcs1-a (n184/d445, 16.7%), gcs1-b (s184/d445, 63.9%), 
gcs1-c (n184/n445, 19.4%). overall nucleotide diversity (π) 36
sequences iranian pfgcs1 0.00066±0.00012, dn-ds value (-0.00028)
was negative, suggesting possible action purifying selection gene.
epitope mapping prediction pfgcs1 antigen showed potential
linear conformational b-cell epitopes located conserved regions.
however, n184s d445n mutations also involved linear and
conformational b-cell epitopes, respectively considered vaccine
design. conclusion, present study showed low genetic diversity of
pfgcs1 gene among iranian isolates. considering pfgcs1 conserved tbv
candidate, data provides valuable information develop pfgcs1-based tbv.
