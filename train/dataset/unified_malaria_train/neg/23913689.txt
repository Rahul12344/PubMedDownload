in eukaryotic organisms, cysteine palmitoylation important reversible
modification impacts protein targeting, folding, stability, interactions
with partners. evidence suggests protein palmitoylation contributes key
biological processes apicomplexa recent palmitome malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum reporting 400 substrates modified
with palmitate broad range protein s-acyl transferases. dynamic
palmitoylation cycles require action acyl-protein thioesterase (apt)
that cleaves palmitate substrates conveys reversibility this
posttranslational modification. work, identified candidates apt
activity toxoplasma gondii. treatment parasites low micromolar
concentrations β-lactone- triazole urea-based inhibitors target human 
apt1 showed varied detrimental effects multiple steps parasite lytic
cycle. use activity-based probe combination inhibitors
revealed existence several serine hydrolases targeted apt1
inhibitors. active serine hydrolase, tgash1, identified homologue
closest human apt1 apt2, characterized further. biochemical analysis
of tgash1 indicated enzyme cleaves substrates specificity
similar apts, homology modeling points toward apt-like enzyme. tgash1
is dispensable parasite survival, indicates severe effects
observed β-lactone inhibitors caused inhibition non-tgash1
targets. ash candidates apt activity functionally characterized,
and one found resistant gene disruption due potential
