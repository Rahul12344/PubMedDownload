as resistance current anti-malarial therapeutics spreads, new compounds to
treat malaria increasingly needed. one promising compound fr900098, a
naturally occurring phosphonate. due limitations chemical synthesis
and biosynthetic methods fr900098 production, potential therapeutic 
yet see widespread implementation. applied combinatorial pathway
engineering strategy improve production fr900098 escherichia coli by
modulating pathway's nine genes four promoters different
strengths. due large size library low screening throughput,
it necessary develop novel screening strategy significantly reduced
the sample size needed find optimal strain. done using biased
libraries localize searching around top hits home high-producing
strains. incorporating strategy, significantly improved strain was
found screening less 3% entire library. coupled with
culturing optimization, strain found produce 96 mg/l, 16-fold
improvement original strain. believe enriched library method
developed used large pathways may difficult to
engineer combinatorial methods due low screening throughput.
