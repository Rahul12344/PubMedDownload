background: malaria diagnosed saliva urine using mitochondrial pcr 
detection plasmodium dna.
methods: blood, saliva urine collected 99 febrile patients referred
to health centers sistan baluchestan province, southeastern iran, may
to november 2011. mitochondrial cytochrome b gene plasmodium falciparum
and plasmodium vivax targeted saliva, urine blood samples using nested
pcr.
results: nested pcr proved sensitive microscopy diagnosis
of sub-microscopic mixed-species infections. results nested pcr
amplifications saliva urine samples showed specificity 97% and
sensitivity 91% 70%, respectively. nested pcr amplifications saliva
samples microscopy showed greatest area receiver operating
characteristic (roc) curve accurate nested pcr amplifications 
of urine samples.
conclusion: nested pcr amplification saliva samples showed good levels of
detection mitochondrial plasmodium dna compared nested pcr blood
(к=0.84; auc=0.94), used reference standard. based results 
of nested pcr well advantages saliva sampling, suggest that
saliva could alternative blood, malaria diagnosis, cases where
repeat sampling required. studies needed validate these
findings.
