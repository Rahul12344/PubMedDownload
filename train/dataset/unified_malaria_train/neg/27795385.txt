efforts control malaria may affect malaria parasite genetic variability and
drug resistance, latter associated genetic events that
promote mechanisms escape drug action. worldwide spread drug resistance
has major obstacle controlling plasmodium falciparum malaria, thus 
the study origin spread associated mutations may provide some
insights prevention emergence. study reports analysis 
p. falciparum genetic diversity, focusing antimalarial resistance-associated
molecular markers two socioeconomically different villages mainland
equatorial guinea. present study took place 8 years previous one,
allowing analysis results introduction an
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act), i.e., artesunate plus amodiaquine.
genetic diversity assessed analysis pfmsp2 gene neutral
microsatellite loci. pfdhps pfdhfr alleles associated with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance flanking microsatellite loci were
investigated, prevalences drug resistance-associated point mutations
of pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps genes estimated. further, to
monitor use act, provide baseline prevalences k13 propeller
mutations pfmdr1 copy numbers. 8 years, noticeable differences occurred
in distribution genotypes conferring resistance chloroquine sp, and
the spread mutated genotypes differed according setting. regarding
artemisinin resistance, although mutations reported linked to
artemisinin resistance present time, several single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) observed k13 gene, suggesting closer
monitoring maintained prevent possible spread artemisinin
resistance africa.
