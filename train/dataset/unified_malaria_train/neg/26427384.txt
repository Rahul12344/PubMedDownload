the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (upp) primary degradation system of
short-lived regulatory proteins. cellular processes cell cycle,
signal transduction, gene expression, dna repair apoptosis regulated by
this upp dysfunctions system important implications the
development cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiac human pathologies.
upp seems also important function eukaryote cells the
human parasites like plasmodium falciparum, causal agent neglected
disease malaria. hence, upp could considered attractive target for
the development compounds anti-malarial anti-cancer properties. recent
online databases like chembl contains larger quantity information terms
of pharmacological assay protocols compounds tested upp inhibitors under
many different conditions. large amount data give new openings the
computer-aided identification upp inhibitors, intrinsic data diversity
is obstacle development successful classifiers. solve this
problem used bob-jenkins moving average operators atom-based 
quadratic molecular indices calculated software tomocomd-cardd (tc) to
develop quantitative model prediction multiple outputs this
complex dataset. multi-target model predict results drugs 22 
molecular cellular targets different organisms accuracies 70% in
both training validation sets.
