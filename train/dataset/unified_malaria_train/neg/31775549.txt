objective: non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) accounts >85% lung cancers, 
and incidence increasing. explored expression differences nsclc
and normal cells predicted potential target sites detection diagnosis
of nsclc.
methods: three microarray datasets gene expression omnibus database were
analyzed using geo2r. gene ontology kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes
enrichment analysis conducted. then, string database, cytoscape, and
mcode plug-in used construct protein-protein interaction (ppi) network 
and screen hub genes. overall disease-free survival hub genes were
analyzed using kaplan-meier curves, relationship expression
patterns target genes tumor grades analyzed validated. gene set
enrichment analysis receiver operating characteristic curves used to
verify enrichment pathways diagnostic performance hub genes.
results: total, 293 differentially expressed genes identified mainly 
enriched cell cycle, ecm-receptor interaction, malaria. ppi
network, 36 hub genes identified, 6 found play significant 
roles carcinogenesis nsclc: cdc20, ect2, kif20a, mki67, tpx2, tyms.
conclusion: identified target genes used biomarkers the
detection diagnosis nsclc.
