background: understanding population genetic structure malaria vector
anopheles gambiae (s.s.) crucial inform genetic control manage
insecticide resistance. unfortunately, species characteristics high
nucleotide diversity, large effective population size, recent range expansion,
and high dispersal ability complicate inference genetic structure across
its range sub-saharan africa. ocean, along great rift valley, 
one recognized barriers gene flow species, effect
of inland lakes, could useful sites initial testing genetic
control strategies, relatively understudied. examine lake victoria 
a barrier ugandan mainland ssese islands, lie 60 
km offshore. use mitochondrial dna (mtdna) populations sampled 2002,
2012 2015, perform bayesian cluster analysis mtdna combined with
microsatellite data previously generated 2002 mosquito dna samples.
results: hierarchical analysis molecular variance bayesian clustering
support significant differentiation mainland lacustrine islands. 
in mtdna haplotype network constructed previous data, haplotypes
are shared even localities separated rift valley, result that
more likely reflects retention shared ancestral polymorphism contemporary
gene flow.
conclusions: relative genetic isolation an. gambiae ssese islands, 
their small size, level terrain ease access mainland, the
relative simplicity vectorial system, prevalence malaria, are
all attributes recommend islands possible sites testing 
genetic control strategies.
