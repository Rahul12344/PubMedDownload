background: plasmodium falciparum infection pregnancy major cause 
poor maternal health, adverse foetal outcome infant mortality sub-saharan 
africa. genetic disposition involved susceptibility malaria pregnancy
and manifestation. micrornas (mirnas) influence gene regulation including
that innate immune responses. mirna-146a rs2910164 g > c single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) associated increased risks several diseases, 
but data malaria available.
methods: association mirna-146a rs2910164 p. falciparum infection
among 509 ghanaian women attending antenatal care (anc) 296 delivering
ghanaian primiparae investigated. malaria parasites diagnosed by
microscopy pcr. leukocyte-associated hemozoin placental samples was
recorded well. proportions compared groups fisher's exact
test, logistic regression models used adjust possible
confounders.
results: pcr, p. falciparum infection detected 63% 67% anc
attendees delivering primiparae, respectively. groups, two three
women either heterozygous homozygous mirna-146a rs2910164. among anc 
attendees, homozygosity conferred increased odds infection (adjusted odds
ratio (aor), 2.3; 95% ci, 1.3-4.0), pronounced among primigravidae
(aor, 5.8; 95% ci, 1.6-26) marginal multigravidae. likewise,
homozygosity mirna-146a rs2910164 primiparae increased odds past or
present placental p. falciparum infection almost six-fold (aor, 5.9; 95% ci,
2.1-18).
conclusions: results indicate snp rs2910164 g > c associated with
increased odds p. falciparum infection first-time pregnant women are
considered lack sufficient acquired immune responses against
pregnancy-specific strains p. falciparum. findings suggest that
mirna-146a involved protective malarial immunity, specifically the
innate component.
