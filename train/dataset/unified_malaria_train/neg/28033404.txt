the packaging organization genomic dna chromatin represents an
additional regulatory layer gene expression, specific nucleosome
positions restrict accessibility regulatory dna elements. the
mechanisms position nucleosomes vivo thought depend the
biophysical properties histones, sequence patterns, like phased
di-nucleotide repeats architecture histone octamer folds dna 
in 1.65 tight turns. comparative studies human p. falciparum histones
reveal latter strongly reduced ability recognize internal
sequence dependent nucleosome positioning signals. contrast, nucleosomes
are positioned at-repeat sequences flanking nucleosomes vivo vitro. 
further, strong sequence variations plasmodium histones, compared to
other mammalian histones, present adaptations at-rich genome. human
and parasite histones bind higher affinity gc-rich dna lower
affinity at-rich dna. however, plasmodium nucleosomes overall less
stable, increased temperature induced mobility, decreased salt stability 
the histones h2a h2b considerable reduced binding affinity gc-rich
dna, compared human nucleosomes. addition, show plasmodium
histone octamers form shortest known nucleosome repeat length (155bp) in
vitro vivo. data suggest biochemical properties the
parasite histones distinct typical characteristics other
eukaryotic histones properties reflect increased accessibility of
the p. falciparum genome.
