trna modifications play important role proper folding trna and
thereby determine functionality adaptor molecule. notwithstanding the
centrality basic process translation, major gap genomics of
plasmodium falciparum unambiguous identification enzymes catalysing the
various trna modifications. study, trna-modifying enzymes p.
falciparum annotated using homology-based approach. based presence of
these identified enzymes, modifications compared of
prokaryotic eukaryotic organisms. sequence comparison and
phylogenetic analysis, identified p. falciparum apicoplast trna-guanine
34 transglycosylase (tgt, ec: 2.4.2.29), shows evidence prokaryotic 
origin. docking analysis modelled tgt structures revealed binding
of quinazolinone derivatives favourable p. falciparum apicoplast tgt
as compared human tgt. molecular dynamic simulation molecular
mechanics/generalized born surface area analysis complex confirmed the
greater binding affinity ligand binding pocket p. falciparum tgt
protein. further, evolutionary patterning analysis identified amino acids 
p. falciparum apicoplast tgt purifying selection pressure and
hence good inhibitor-targeting sites. based computational
studies, suggest p. falciparum apicoplast trna-guanine 34
transglycosylase promising drug target.
