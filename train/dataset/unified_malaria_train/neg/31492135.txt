background: malaria one important vector-borne diseases high
fatality rates tropical countries. pattern emergence spread of
novel antigenic variants, leading escape vaccine-induced immunity might 
factors responsible severe malaria. high level polymorphism been
reported among malarial antigens selection pressure imposed by
host immunity. limited reports available comparative stage-specific 
genetic diversity among plasmodium vivax candidate genes complicated vivax
malaria. present study planned study genetic diversity (pvcsp and
pvs25) among complicated uncomplicated p. vivax isolates.
methods: pvcsp pvs2-specific pcrs dna sequencing performed p.
vivax pcr positive samples. genetic diversity analysed using appropriate
software.
results: present study carried 143 p. vivax clinical isolates,
collected postgraduate institute medical education research,
chandigarh. among classic variant types pvcsp, vk210 (99%;
115/116) found predominant complicated uncomplicated group 
isolates. various peptide repeat motifs (prms) observed, gdradgqpa
(prm1) gdraagqpa (prm2) widely distributed among p. vivax
isolates. whereas among pvs25 isolates, 100% double mutants (e97q/i130t)
in complicated (45/45) well uncomplicated (81/81) group was
observed.
conclusion: analysis genetic variability enables understanding the
role genetic variants severe vivax malaria.
