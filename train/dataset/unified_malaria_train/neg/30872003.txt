splenic red pulp macrophages play critical role infiltration infected rbc
and elimination pathogens malarial infection. however, efficiency
of pathogenic processing intricate pathway followed boost 
downstream immune response studied details. checked status
of autophagic regulation within cells infection and
also modulated autophagic flux either inducer inhibitor. found
that upregulation autophagic gene corresponding pathway is
correlated better parasite clearance survivability, enhanced
downstream immune response. also increases phagocytic potential with
better lysosomal associated protein ii synthesis. autophagolysosome
formation increases well, vacuole bound lc3b protein detected.
chemokine synthesized red pulp macrophage helps mediating induction
for recruiting neutrophil cd4 + t cells splenic red pulp region. the
skewing m1 macrophage polarity observed post autophagic induction a
better costimulatory molecule like cd80, cd86 expression antigen presenting
molecule mhc i, mhc ii observed. study shows possibility an
alternative adjuvant therapy regimen malarial patient inducing 
autophagic pathway targets red pulp macrophages. might helpful
for better pathogen degradation processing. subsequent clearance of
parasite result better outcome patients.
