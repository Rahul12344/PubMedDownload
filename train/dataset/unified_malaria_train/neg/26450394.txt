the particular virulence plasmodium falciparum manifests diverse severe
malaria syndromes cerebral malaria, severe anemia placental malaria. the
cause severity diversity infection outcome, ability
of infected erythrocyte (ie) bind range different human receptors
through plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) the
surface infected cell. var genes encoding large pfemp1 antigens
are extensively polymorphic, vaccine development strategies focused on
targeting functional binding epitopes. involves identification of
recombinant fragments pfemp1s induce antibodies, hinder the
adhesion ie given receptor tissue. different assays measure the
blocking adhesion described literature, different
advantages. chapter describes high-throughput assay used the
preclinical clinical development var2csa based vaccine placental
