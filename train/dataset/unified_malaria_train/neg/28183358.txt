background: anopheles sinensis primary vector plasmodium vivax malaria
in regions china. comprehensive understanding genetic variation 
structure mosquito would benefit vector control a
further attempt contribute malaria elimination china. however, 
only inadequate population genetic data pertaining an. sinensis currently.
methods: genetic variations structure among populations an. sinensis was
examined analyzed based nucleotide sequences 662 nt variable
region mitochondrial cox1 gene among 15 populations 20 collection
sites china.
results: total 453 individuals 15 populations analyzed. cox1
gene sequences aligned, 247 haplotypes detected, 41 shared
between populations. range haplotype diversity 0.709 (yunnan) 
0.998 (anhui). genealogic network showed haplotypes divided
into two clusters, cluster high level homoplasy, cluster ii
included almost individuals yunnan population. yunnan population
displayed significantly high level genetic differentiation (0.452-0.622) and
a restricted gene flow populations. pairwise f st values among
other populations lower. amova result showed percentage of
variation within populations (83.83%) higher among populations
(16.17%). mantel test suggested geographical distance significantly 
contribute genetic differentiation (r 2 = 0.0125, p = 0.59). neutral test 
and mismatch analysis results showed an. sinensis population has
undergone demographic expansions.
conclusions: anopheles sinensis populations showed high genetic polymorphism by
cox1 gene. weak genetic structure may consequence low genetic
differentiation high gene flow among populations, except yunnan samples. 
the yunnan population isolated populations, gene flow limited 
by geographical distance barriers. findings provide theoretical 
basis vector surveillance vector control china.
