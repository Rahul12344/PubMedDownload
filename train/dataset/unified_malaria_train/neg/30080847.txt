there need efficient cell-based assay amenable high-throughput
drug screening giardia lamblia. here, report development a
screening method utilizing g. lamblia engineered express red-shifted firefly
luciferase. parasite growth replication quantified using d-luciferin 
a substrate bioluminescent read-out plateform. assay validated 
reproducibility reliability medicines malaria venture (mmv)
pathogen box compounds. g. lamblia, forty-three compounds showed ≥ 75%
inhibition parasite growth initial screen (16 μm), fifteen showing
≥ 95% inhibition. pathogen box also screened nanoluciferase
expressing (nluc) c. parvum, yielding 85 compounds ≥ 75% parasite growth
inhibition 10 μm, six showing ≥ 95% inhibition. representative set of
seven compounds activity parasites analyzed to
determine effective concentration causes 50% growth inhibition (ec50)
and cytotoxicity mammalian hepg2 cells. four seven compounds 
previously known effective treating either giardia cryptosporidium.
the remaining three shared obvious chemical similarity previously
characterized anti-parasite diarrheal drugs offer new medicinal chemistry
opportunities therapeutic development. results suggest the
bioluminescent assays suitable large-scale screening chemical
libraries c. parvum g. lamblia.
