microtus fortis non-permissive host schistosoma japonicum. m.
fortis lymphocytes known provide natural resistance s. japonicum, 
the specific mechanism remains unclear. bone marrow transplantation (bmt) model
was established using immunodeficient mice, either nude (experiment 1) v(d)j
recombination activation gene deficient mice (rag-1(-/-)) (experiment 2) as
recipients m. fortis c57bl/6 mice donors. growth development of
s. japonicum evaluated group assess role m. fortis
lymphocytes response infection. lymphocyte ratios s.
japonicum-specific antibody production transplanted groups increased
significantly compared non-transplanted group. spleen indices and
density splenic lymphocytes transplanted rag-1(-/-) mice higher than
those non-transplanted rag-1(-/-) mice. difference worm burden was
observed among group (transplants derived m. fortis), b (transplants
derived c57bl/6 mouse) c (non-transplanted mice), although worms in
group shorter groups, except non-transplanted
rag-1(-/-) mice. reproductive systems worms mice (nude rag-1(-/-))
transplanted m. fortis mature mice (nude or
rag-1(-/-)) transplanted c57bl/6 mouse non-transplanted nude mice, but
they mature worms non-transplanted rag-1(-/-) mice. therefore, 
the transplantation model using nude rag-1(-/-) mice successfully
established. m. fortis lymphocytes appear affect s. japonicum 
worm burden, led schistosome shortening significant reduction
in parasite spawning. thus, m. fortis cellular humoral immunity provides a
defense schistosomes negatively impacting parasite growth and
reproductive development.
