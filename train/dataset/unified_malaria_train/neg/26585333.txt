phospholipid biosynthesis critical development, differentiation and
pathogenesis several eukaryotic pathogens. genetic studies validated 
pathway phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis phosphatidylserine catalyzed 
by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase enzymes (psd) suitable target for
development antimicrobials; however inhibitors class enzymes
have discovered. show plasmodium falciparum psd restore 
essential function yeast gene strains requiring psd growth.
genetic, biochemical metabolic analyses demonstrate amino acids 
positions 40 70 parasite enzyme critical proenzyme processing 
and decarboxylase activity. used essential role plasmodium psd yeast
as tool screening library anti-malarials. one compounds is
7-chloro-n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-quinolinamine, inhibitor potent activity
against p. falciparum, low toxicity toward mammalian cells. synthesized an
analog compound showed inhibits pfpsd activity eliminates
plasmodium yoelii infection mice. results highlight importance of
4-quinolinamines novel class drugs targeting membrane biogenesis via
inhibition psd activity.
