insects transmit numerous devastating diseases, including malaria, dengue fever, 
and sleeping sickness. olfactory cues guide insects hosts, thus 
responsible disease transmission. understanding molecular basis insect
olfaction could facilitate development interventions. first step to
heterologously overexpress purify insect olfactory receptors (ors). is
challenging, ors membrane proteins. here, show insect ors and
their co-receptor expressed e. coli cell-free system. after
immunoaffinity chromatography, ors ~95% pure, 1 mg/10 ml
reaction obtained. circular dichroism together microscale thermophoresis 
indicate receptor properly folded, bind respective
ligand. first time insect ors expressed e. coli
system. methods described could facilitate future structure-function
studies, may aid developments alleviate suffering millions
caused insect-transmitted diseases.
