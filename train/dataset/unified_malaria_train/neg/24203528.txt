during search novel natural products entomopathogenic xenorhabdus
doucetiae dsm17909 x. mauleonii dsm17908 novel peptides named xenoamicins
were identified addition already known antibiotics xenocoumacin and
xenorhabdin. xenoamicins acylated tridecadepsipeptides consisting mainly
hydrophobic amino acids. main derivative xenoamicin (1) isolated from
x. mauleonii dsm17908, structure elucidated detailed 1d 2d nmr
experiments. detailed ms experiments, also combination labeling
experiments, confirmed determined structure allowed structure elucidation
of additional derivatives. moreover, xenoamicin biosynthesis gene cluster was
identified analyzed x. doucetiae dsm17909, participation in
xenoamicin biosynthesis confirmed mutagenesis. advanced marfey's analysis 
of 1 showed absolute configuration amino acids agreement
with predicted stereochemistry deduced nonribosomal peptide
synthetase xababcd. biological testing revealed activity 1 plasmodium 
falciparum neglected tropical diseases antibacterial activity.
