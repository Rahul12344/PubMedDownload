plasmodium falciparum (pf) blood stages express falstatin, inhibitor of
cysteine proteases (icp), implicated regulating proteolysis during
red blood cell infection. recent data using plasmodium berghei rodent malaria
model suggested additional role icp infection hepatocytes by
sporozoites liver-stage development. characterize 
role icp in vivo infection plasmodium yoelii (py) pf. found
that py-icp refractory targeted gene deletion indicating essential
function asexual blood-stage replication, significant downregulation
of icp using regulated system impact blood-stage growth. py-icp
localized vesicles within asexual blood-stage parasite cytoplasm, well 
as parasitophorous vacuole, exported dynamic exomembrane
structures infected rbc. sporozoites, expression observed in
rhoptries, addition intracellular vesicles distinct trap containing
micronemes. liver-stage development, py-icp confined parasite
compartment final phase liver-stage development when, after
parasitophorous vacuolemembrane breakdown, released infected
hepatocyte. finally, identified cysteine protease yoelipain-2 binding
partner py-icp blood-stage infection. data show icp may be
important regulating proteolytic processes blood-stage development, and
is likely playing role liver stage-hepatocyte interactions time of
exoerythrocytic merozoite release.
