host cell remodelling hallmark malaria pathogenesis. involves protein 
folding, unfolding trafficking events thus participation chaperones
such hsp70s hsp40s well speculated. recently, hsp40s were
thought sole representative parasite chaperones the
exportome. however, based re-annotated plasmodium falciparum genome
sequence, putative candidate exported hsp70 reported, which
otherwise known pseudogene. raised specific antiserum 
c-terminal peptide uniquely present pfhsp70-x. immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence-based approaches combination sub-cellular
fractionation saponin streptolysin-o taken determine the
expression localization pfhsp70-x infected erythrocyte. the
re-annotated sequence pfhsp70-x reveals functional protein 
endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide. gets maximally expressed schizont
stage intra-erythrocytic life cycle. majority protein localizes 
parasitophorous vacuole gets exported erythrocyte
compartment associates maurer's clefts. identification an
exported parasite hsp70 chaperone presents us fact parasite has
evolved customized chaperones might playing crucial roles aspects 
trafficking host cell remodelling.
