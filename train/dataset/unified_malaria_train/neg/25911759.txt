cd4 cells orchestrate immunity blood-stage malaria. however, major
challenge designing vaccines disease poor understanding the
requirements generation protective memory cells (tmem) from
responding effector cells (teff) chronic parasite infection. study, 
we use transgenic mouse model cells specific merozoite surface
protein (msp)-1 plasmodium chabaudi show activated cells generate
three distinct teff subsets progressive activation phenotypes. earliest 
observed teff subsets (cd127(-)cd62l(hi)cd27(+)) less divided cd62l(lo) 
teff express memory genes. intermediate (cd62l(lo)cd27(+)) effector subsets
include multicytokine-producing cells, whereas fully activated
(cd62l(lo)cd27(-)) late effector cells terminal teff phenotype (pd-1(+),
fas(hi), annexinv(+)). show although il-2 promotes expansion, actually
slows terminal effector differentiation. using adoptive transfer, show that
only early teff survive contraction phase generate terminal late teff
subsets, whereas uninfected recipients, become central effector 
tmem. furthermore, show progression toward full teff activation is
promoted increased duration infection, long-term promotes tem 
differentiation. therefore, defined markers progressive activation 
cd4 teff peak malaria infection, including subset survives the
contraction phase make tmem, show ag cytokine levels cd4 t
cell expansion influence proportion activated cells survive
contraction generate memory malaria infection.
