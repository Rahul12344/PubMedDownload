plasmodium knowlesi p. cynomolgi simian malaria parasites capable of
causing symptomatic human infections. interaction duffy binding
protein alpha p. knowlesi merozoite duffy-antigen receptor for
chemokine (darc) human macaque erythrocyte membrane prerequisite for
establishment blood stage infection whereas darc required for
erythrocyte invasion p. cynomolgi. gain insights evolution 
pkdbp gene family comprising pkdbpα, pkdbpβ pkdbpγ, member dbp
gene family p. cynomolgi (pcydbp1), complete coding sequences these
genes analyzed thai field isolates compared publicly
available dbp sequences p. vivax (pvdbp). complete coding sequences of
pkdbpα (n=11), pkdbpβ (n=11), pkdbpγ (n=10) pcydbp1 (n=11) obtained from
direct sequencing pcr products. nucleotide diversity dbp highly
variable across malaria species. pcydbp1 displayed greatest level of
nucleotide diversity pkdbp gene members exhibited comparable levels 
diversity. positive selection occurred domains i, ii iv pvdbp in
domain v pcydbp1. although deviation neutrality detected in
domain ii pkdbpα, signature positive selection identified the
putative darc binding site domain. dbp gene families seem have
arisen following model concerted evolution paralogs rather than
orthologs clustered phylogenetic tree. presence identical or
closely related repeats exclusive pkdbp gene family suggests that
duplication gene members postdated divergence ancestral pcydbp 
and pvdbp lineages. intragenic recombination detected dbp genes of
these malaria species. despite limited number isolates, p. knowlesi from
thailand shared phylogenetically related domain ii sequences pkdbpα and
pkdbpγ peninsular malaysia, consistent geographic
proximity.
