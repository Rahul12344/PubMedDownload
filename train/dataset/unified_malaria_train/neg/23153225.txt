background: signal peptide one important motifs involved in
protein trafficking ultimately influences protein function. considering
the expected functional conservation among orthologs hypothesized that
divergence signal peptides within orthologous groups mainly due to
n-terminal protein sequence misannotation. thus, discrepancies signal peptide 
prediction orthologous proteins used identify misannotated proteins in
five plasmodium species.
methods: signal peptide (signalp) orthology (orthomcl) combined an
innovative strategy identify orthologous groups showing discrepancies in
signal peptide prediction among protein members (mixed groups). a
comparative analysis, multiple alignments groups gene
models visually inspected search misannotated proteins and, whenever
possible, alternative gene models proposed. thresholds signal peptide
prediction parameters also modified reduce impact possible
source discrepancy among orthologs. validation new gene models based on
rt-pcr (few examples) experimental evidence already published (apiloc).
results: rate misannotated proteins significantly higher mixed
groups positive negative groups, corroborating proposed
hypothesis. total 478 proteins reannotated change signal peptide
prediction negative positive common. reannotations triggered
the conversion almost 50% mixed groups, reduced by
optimization signal peptide prediction parameters.
conclusions: methodological novelty proposed combining orthology and
signal peptide prediction proved effective strategy the
identification proteins showing wrongly n-terminal annotated sequences, it
might important impact available data genome-wide searching of
potential vaccine drug targets proteins involved host/parasite
interactions, demonstrated five plasmodium species.
