transient regulation plasmodium numbers density induces fever
has observed chronic malaria infections humans. species
transcending control cannot explained immunity alone. using vitro
system observed density dependent regulation malaria population size
as mechanism possibly explain vivo observations. specifically,
plasmodium falciparum blood stages high low-density environment
exhibited unique phenotypic changes late trophozoite (lt) schizont
stages intraerythrocytic cycle. included order appearance:
failure schizonts mature merozoites replicate, apoptotic-like
morphological changes including shrinking, loss mitochondrial membrane
potential, blebbing eventual release aberrant parasites infected
erythrocytes. unique death phenotype triggered stage-specific
manner sensing high-density culture environment. conditions glucose
starvation, nutrient depletion, high lactate could induce phenotype. 
a high-density culture environment induced rapid global changes parasite
transcriptome including differential expression genes involved cell
remodeling, clonal antigenic variation, metabolism, cell death pathways
including apoptosis-associated metacaspase gene. transcriptional profile 
was also characterized concomitant expression asexual sexual
stage-specific genes. data show strong evidence support hypothesis
that density sensing exists p. falciparum. indicate an
apoptotic-like mechanism may play role p. falciparum density regulation,
which, yeast, features quite distinguishable mammalian
apoptosis.database: gene expression data available geo databases under
the accession number gse91188.
