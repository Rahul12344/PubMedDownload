objective: study, kinetic analysis performed understand the
functional importance amino terminal active site previously
mutated plasmodium vivax lactate dehydrogenase enzyme mimicking toxoplasma
gondii i, ii, eimeria acervulina eimeria tenella ldh's.
material methods: mutant ldh genes amplified pcr 6xhistag was
added c-terminal enzymes. ldh enzymes overproduced as
recombinant e. coli cells, purified ni-nta agarose matrix kinetic
properties analysed.
results: observing increase km values mutant enzymes showed mutations 
in place caused decreasing affinity enzyme substrate. however
kcat values throughout mutant proteins.
conclusion: sensitivity studied region emphasizes significance this
site drug design studies plasmodium apicomplexans.
