background: dna immunization induce long-term immune responses, are
required design effective hiv vaccine. shown antigen-expressing
plasmids increase protective immunity infectious diseases such
as: influenza malaria. however, dna-based immunizations poor
immunogenicity, thus use potent immunoadjuvants enhance potency.
methods: current study, preparation recombinant hiv-1 nef, gp96 and
hmgb1 dna constructs performed bacterial system. then, immunogenicity 
of dna construct harboring hiv-1 nef gene (pcdna-nef) studied using two
endogenous adjuvants (pcdna-hmgb1 pcdna-gp96) balb/c mouse model.
results: data showed co-injection pcdna-nef pcdna-hmgb1
effectively raised humoral cell-mediated immune responses mice as
compared pcdna-nef adjuvanted pcdna-gp96. indeed, co-immunization of
hiv-1 nef dna hmgb1 dna significantly induced high levels igg2a ifn-Î³
directed toward th1 responses also cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) activity in
comparison immunized groups.
conclusion: findings suggest full length hmgb1 gene could 
more efficient adjuvant improvement therapeutic hiv dna-based immunization
compared full length gp96 gene (tab. 1, fig. 3, ref. 58).
