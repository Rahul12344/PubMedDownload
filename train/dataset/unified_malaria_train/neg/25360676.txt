the principal afrotropical malaria vector mosquito, anopheles gambiae remains a
significant threat human health. anthropophagic species, females
detect respond range human-derived volatile kairomones as
ammonia, lactic acid, carboxylic acids quest blood meals. 
while molecular underpinnings mosquito olfaction host seeking are
becoming better understood, many questions remain unanswered. study, we
have identified characterized two candidate ammonium transporter genes, agamt
and agrh50 expressed mosquito antenna may contribute to
physiological behavioral responses ammonia, important host
kairomone vector mosquitoes. agamt transcripts highly enhanced female 
antennae splice variant agrh50 appears antennal-specific.
functional expression agamt xenopus laevis oocytes facilitates inward
currents response ammonium methylammonium, agrh50 able to
partially complement yeast ammonium transporter mutant strain, validating their
conserved roles ammonium transporters. present evidence suggest that
both agamt agrh50 vivo ammonium transporters important for
ammonia sensitivity an. gambiae antennae, either clearing ammonia 
sensillar lymph facilitating sensory neuron responses environmental
exposure. accordingly, agamt agrh50 represent new potentially important
targets development novel vector control strategies.
