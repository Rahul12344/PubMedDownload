malaria caused obligate intracellular protozoan parasite replicates
within destroys erythrocytes. asexual blood stages causative agent 
the virulent form human malaria, plasmodium falciparum, cultivated
indefinitely vitro human erythrocytes, facilitating experimental analysis
of parasite cell biology, biochemistry genetics. however, efforts improve 
understanding basic biology important pathogen develop
urgently required new antimalarial drugs vaccines, suffer paucity of
basic research tools. includes simple means quantifying effects 
drugs, antibodies gene modifications parasite fitness replication
rates. describe development validation extremely simple,
robust plaque assay used visualise parasite replication and
resulting host erythrocyte destruction level clonal parasite
populations. demonstrate applications plaque assay using 
phenotypic characterisation two p. falciparum conditional mutants displaying
reduced fitness vitro.
