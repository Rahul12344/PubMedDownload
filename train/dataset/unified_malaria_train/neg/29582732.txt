data prevalence antimalarial molecular resistance markers pregnant women
in ghana scarce. prevalence single nucleotide polymorphisms/haplotypes in
the pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps genes assessed cross-sectional
study involving 200 pregnant women. almost 90% infections wild type at
the pfcrt gene whereas pfmdr1 nfd mutant haplotype occurred 43% of
samples. prevalence pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutation 92.6% whereas
pfdfr/pfdhps quintuple mutation k540e observed. study provides
important updates antimalarial resistance markers ghanaian pregnant women
and suggests increased tolerance one first-line treatment options in
ghana: artemether-lumefantrine. data support view that
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine still efficacious intermittent preventive
treatment ghana, impact increased doses selection mutations
needs assessed. continuing surveillance resistance markers is
important inform changes antimalarial drug policy pregnancy.
