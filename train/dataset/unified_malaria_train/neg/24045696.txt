intracellular pathogens contribute significant proportion infectious
diseases worldwide. successful strategy evading immune system by
hiding inside host cells common microorganism classes, which
exploit membrane microdomains, enriched cholesterol sphingolipids, to
invade colonize host cell. assemblies, distinct biochemical
properties, isolated means flotation sucrose density gradient
centrifugation insoluble nonionic detergents low
temperature. analyzed protein lipid contents detergent-resistant
membranes erythrocytes infected plasmodium falciparum, deadly
human malaria parasite. proteins associated membrane microdomains trophic
parasite blood stages (trophozoites) include abundance chaperones,
molecules involved vesicular trafficking, enzymes implicated host
hemoglobin degradation. 60% identified proteins contain predicted 
localization signal suggesting role membrane microdomains protein
sorting/trafficking. validate proteomic data, raised antibodies against
six plasmodium proteins characterized previously. selected candidates
were recovered floating low-density fractions density gradient
centrifugation. analyzed proteins localized either internal organelles,
such mitochondrion endoplasmic reticulum, exported membrane 
structures, parasitophorous vacuole membrane maurer's clefts, implicated 
in targeting parasite proteins host erythrocyte cytosol surface. the
relative abundance cholesterol phospholipid species varies gradient
fractions containing detergent-resistant membranes, suggesting heterogeneity in
the lipid composition isolated microdomain population. study the
first report showing presence cholesterol-rich microdomains distinct 
properties subcellular localization trophic stages plasmodium
