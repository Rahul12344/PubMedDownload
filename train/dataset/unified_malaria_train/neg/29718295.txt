the hs3st3a1/b1 genes encode two homologous 3-o-sulfotransferases involved the
late modification step heparan sulfate (hs) biosynthesis. addition to
the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) rs28470223 (c > t) promoter
region hs3st3a1 rs62636623 (gly/arg) stem region hs3st3b1, 
three missense mutations (rs62056073, rs61729712 rs9906590) located within
the catalytic sulfotransferase domain 3-ost-b1 linked associated to
plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. ascertain functional effects 
snp associations, investigated regulatory effect rs28470223 and
characterized enzymatic activity missense snp rs61729712 (ser279asn)
localized proximity substrate binding cleft. snp rs28470223 results
in decreased promoter activity hs3st3a1 k562 cells, suggesting reduced in
vivo transcription activity target gene. comparative kinetic analysis of
wt hs3st3b1 ser269asn variant (rs61729712) using hs-derived
oligosaccharide substrate reveals slightly higher catalytic activity the
snp variant. genetic enzymatic studies suggest genetic variations 
in enzymes responsible hs 3-o-sulfation modulate promoter and
enzymatic activities may influence p. falciparum parasitaemia.
