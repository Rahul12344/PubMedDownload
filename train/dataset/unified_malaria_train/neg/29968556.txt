histidine-rich protein 2 plasmodium falciparum (pfhrp2) forms basis of
many current malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts). concerning there
are parasites lack part pfhrp2 gene, thus express
the pfhrp2 protein; parasites identifiable pfhrp2-detecting rdts.
very limited information available regarding pfhrp2 genetic variation papua
new guinea (png). present study, gene variation evaluated using
169 samples previously collected wosera area east sepik province of
png. molecular diagnosis samples showed 81% infected, p.
falciparum present 91% infected samples. one hundred twenty
samples amplified pfhrp2 exon-2, 12 randomly selected
amplicons sequenced, yielding 18 sequences, unique. baker 
repeat type 2 Ã— type 7 numbers ranged 0 108. epitope mapping analysis
revealed three major epitopes, dahhahha, ahhaadahha, ahhaadahh, were
present high prevalence frequencies. major epitopes shown 
to recognized monoclonal antibodies 3a4 ptl-3 (dahhahha), c1-13
(ahhaadahha), s2-5 c2-3 (ahhaadahh). study provides further
information high genetic variation pfhrp2 unclear relationship 
with prediction rdt detection sensitivity, identifies major epitopes in
this gene png. results could relevant useful understand 
genetic diversity gene performance current future rdts 
this malarious region world.
