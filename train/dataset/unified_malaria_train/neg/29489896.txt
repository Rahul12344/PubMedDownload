peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps) commensal microbes mediate
pathogen infection outcomes insect disease vectors. although pgrp-ld is
retained multiple vectors, role host defense remains elusive. we
report anopheles stephensi pgrp-ld protects vector malaria parasite
infection regulating gut homeostasis. specifically, knock pgrp-ld
(dsld) increased susceptibility plasmodium berghei infection, decreased the
abundance gut microbiota changed spatial distribution. outcome 
resulted change structural integrity peritrophic matrix
(pm), chitinous proteinaceous barrier lines midgut lumen.
reduction microbiota dsld mosquitoes due upregulation immune
effectors led dysregulation pm genes pm fragmentation. elimination of
gut microbiota antibiotic treated mosquitoes (abx) led pm loss and
increased vectorial competence. recolonization abx mosquitoes indigenous 
enterobacter sp. restored pm integrity decreased mosquito vectorial capacity.
silencing pgrp-ld mosquitoes without pm influence vector
competence. results indicate pgpr-ld protects gut microbiota by
preventing hyper-immunity, turn promotes pm structurally integrity. 
intact pm plays key role limiting p. berghei infection.
