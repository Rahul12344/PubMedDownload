background: efficacy anti-malarial drugs assessed period of
28-63 days (depending drugs' residence time) following initiation of
treatment order capture late failures. however, prolonged follow-up
increases likelihood new infections depending transmission intensity.
therefore, molecular genotyping highly polymorphic regions plasmodium
falciparum msp1, msp2 glurp loci usually carried distinguish
recrudescence (true failures) new infections. tool adopted
as integral part anti-malarial efficacy studies clinical trials.
however, concerns utility reliability conclusions 
drawn molecular typing depend genetic profile respective
parasite populations, profile systematically documented most
endemic areas. study presents genetic diversity p. falciparum msp1,
msp2 glurp markers selected sub-saharan africa countries varying
levels endemicity namely malawi, tanzania, uganda, burkina faso são tomé.
methods: total 780 baseline (day 0) blood samples children less seven
years, recruited randomized controlled clinical trials done 1996 and
2000 genotyped. dna extracted; allelic frequency diversity were
investigated pcr followed capillary electrophoresis msp2 fragment
sizing digitalized gel imager msp1 glurp.
results conclusion: plasmodium falciparum msp1, msp2 glurp markers were
highly polymorphic low allele frequencies. total 17 msp1 genotypes
[eight mad20-, one ro33- eight k1-types]; 116 msp2 genotypes [83 3d7 33
fc27- types] 14 glurp genotypes recorded. five sites recorded very
high expected heterozygosity (he) values (0.68 - 0.99). highest msp2
locus (he=0.99), lowest msp1 (he=0.68) (p<0.0001). genetic diversity 
and allelic frequency recorded independent transmission intensity
(p=0.84, p=0.25 respectively. genotypes particularly high frequencies; 
however abundant showed 4% probability new infection would
share genotype baseline infection. unlikely confound
the distinction recrudescence new infection, particularly than
one marker used genotyping. hence, study supports use msp1,
msp2 glurp malaria clinical trials sub-saharan africa discriminate
new recrudescent infections.
