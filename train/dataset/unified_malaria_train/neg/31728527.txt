epigenetic regulatory mechanisms central development survival of
all eukaryotic organisms. mechanisms critically depend marking of
chromatin domains distinctive histone tail modifications (ptms) their
recognition effector protein complexes. used quantitative proteomic
approaches unveil interactions ptms associated reader protein
complexes plasmodium falciparum, unicellular parasite causing malaria.
histone peptide pull-downs prominent and/or parasite-specific ptms 
revealed binding preference 14 putative novel reader proteins.
amongst others, highlighted acetylation-level-dependent recruitment of
the bdp1/bdp2 complex identified phd-finger protein (phd 1, pf3d7_1008100)
that could mediate cross-talk h3k4me2/3 h3k9ac marks. tagging and
interaction proteomics 12 identified proteins unveiled composition 5
major epigenetic complexes, including elusive tbp-associated-factor complex
as well two distinct gcn5/ada2 complexes. furthermore, highlighted a
remarkable degree interaction five (sub)complexes. collectively,
this study provides extensive inventory ptm-reader interactions and
composition epigenetic complexes. fuel explorations
of gene regulation amongst ancient eukaryotes, also provides stepping stone
for exploration ptm-reader interactions antimalarial drug development.
