currently available sequencing technologies enable quick economical
sequencing many new eukaryotic parasite (apicomplexan kinetoplastid)
species strains. compared snp calling approaches, de novo assembly these
genomes enables researchers additionally determine insertion, deletion and
recombination events well detect complex sequence diversity, as
that seen variable multigene families. however, currently no
automated eukaryotic annotation pipelines offering required range results 
to facilitate analyses. suitable pipeline needs perform
evidence-supported gene finding well functional annotation pseudogene
detection generation output ready submitted public
database. moreover, current tool includes quick yet informative comparative
analyses first pass visualization annotation analysis results. 
to overcome needs developed companion web server
(http://companion.sanger.ac.uk) providing parasite genome annotation service
using reference-based approach. demonstrate use performance of
companion annotating two leishmania plasmodium genomes typical parasite
cases evaluate results compared manually annotated references.
