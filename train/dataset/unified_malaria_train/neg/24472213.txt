background: plasmodium vivax protozoan parasite extensive worldwide 
distribution, highly prevalent asia well mesoamerica south 
america. southern mexico, p. vivax transmission endemic recent
studies suggest parasites unique biological genetic features.
the msp1 gene shown high rate nucleotide substitutions, deletions,
insertions, mosaic structure reveals frequent events recombination,
maybe highly divergent parasite isolates.
methods: nucleotide sequence variation polymorphic icb5-6 fragment 
the msp1 gene mexican worldwide isolates analysed. understand how
genotype diversity arises, disperses persists mexico, genetic
structure genealogical relationships local isolates examined. to
identify new sequence hybrids evolutionary relationships p. 
vivax isolates circulating worldwide two haplotype networks constructed
questioning two portions icb5-6 different evolutionary history.
results: twelve new msp1 icb5-6 haplotypes p. vivax mexico were
identified. nucleotide sequences show mosaic structure comprising three
partially conserved two variable subfragments resulted five
different sequence types. variable subfragment sv1 undergone
recombination events resulted hybrid sequences haplotype network
allocated mexican haplotypes three lineages, corresponding sal i
and belem types, divergent group. contrast, network from
icb5-6 fragment sv1 revealed mexican haplotypes belong two
separate lineages, none closely related sal belem sequences.
conclusions: results suggest new hybrid haplotypes southern
mexico result least three different recombination events. these
rearrangements likely resulted recombination haplotypes of
highly divergent lineages frequently distributed south america and
asia diversified rapidly.
