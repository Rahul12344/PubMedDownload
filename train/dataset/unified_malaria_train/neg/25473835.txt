plasmodium falciparum unique among human malarias ability sequester 
in post-capillary venules host organs. main variant antigens implicated
are p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), be
divided three major groups (a-c). study unique examination of
sequestered populations parasites genetic background expression of
pfemp1 groups. collected post-mortem tissue twenty paediatric hosts 
pathologically different forms cerebral malaria (cm1 cm2) parasitaemic
controls (pc) directly examine sequestered populations parasites the
brain, heart gut. use two different techniques investigate this
question produced divergent results. quantitative pcr, group var genes 
upregulated three organs cm2 pc cases. contrast, cm1
infections displaying high levels sequestration negligible vascular
pathology, high expression group b var. cloning sequencing of
var transcript tags samples indicated uniformly low expression of
group a-like var. generally, within organ sample, 1-2 sequences expressed
at dominant levels. 23% var tags detected multiple patients despite
the p. falciparum infections genetically distinct, two tags were
observed seven hosts high expression brains 3-4
patients. study novel examination sequestered parasites
responsible fatal cerebral malaria describes expression patterns the
major cytoadherence ligand three organ-derived populations three
