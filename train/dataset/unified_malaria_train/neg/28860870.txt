background: concurrent dengue mixed malaria infections single patient
present overlapping clinical manifestations pose diagnostic
challenge management dilemma areas common endemicities.
methods: report case young male tested positive plasmodium
vivax plasmodium falciparum along dengue infection. showed signs of
early treatment failure artemisinin combination therapy (artesunate with
sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine). molecular analysis drug resistance genes viz:
chloroquine resistance (pfcrt), multidrug resistance (pfmdr-1), sulfadoxine
(pfdhps), pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), artemisinin resistance (keltch 13) was
performed.
results: rise parasitemia <2% 5% observed 3 days of
treatment. mutations pfcrt, pfmdr-1, pfdhfr, pfdhps genes detected as
a possible cause treatment failure.
conclusion: increased severity, overlapping symptoms, suspected resistance to
treatment warrants multidimensional diagnostic approach diligent
therapeutic monitoring.
