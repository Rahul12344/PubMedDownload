background: diagnostic techniques based pcr detection plasmodium
dna highly sensitive specific. vast majority techniques
rely, however, invasive sampling blood infected hosts. is,
currently, considerable interest possibility using body fluids other
than blood sources parasite dna pcr diagnosis.
methods: urine faeces obtained plasmodium knowlesi
infected-japanese macaque (macaca fuscata) course experimentally
induced infection. p. knowlesi dna (pkdna) extracted urine faeces were
monitored nested pcr targeting p. knowlesi specific cytochrome b (cytb)
gene.
results: urinary pkdna detected day 2, amplified using dna
templates extracted samples day 4, day 5 day 6. subsequently,
urinary pkdna detected day 7 day 11, day 20 day 30.
pkdna faeces detected day 7 day 11, day 20 day
37. moreover, real-time quantitative pcr showed remarkable increase the
amount urinary pkdna following anti-malarial treatment. might been
due release large amount pkdna degraded parasites a
result anti-malarial treatment, leading excretion pkdna the
urine.
conclusions: cytb-pcr system using urine faecal samples potential
use molecular epidemiological surveys malaria. particular, monkey faecal
samples could useful detection zoonotic primate malaria its
natural hosts.
