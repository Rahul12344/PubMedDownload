the understanding malaria vector species association bionomic
traits vital targeting malaria interventions measuring effectiveness. 
many entomological studies rely morphological identification mosquitoes,
limiting recognition visually distinct species/species groups. anopheles
species assignments based ribosomal dna its2 mitochondrial dna coi were
compared morphological identifications luangwa nyimba districts in
zambia. comparison morphological molecular identifications determined 
that interpretations species compositions, insecticide resistance assays, host
preference studies, trap efficacy, plasmodium infections incorrect 
using morphological identification alone. morphological identifications
recognized eight anopheles species 18 distinct sequence groups species
were identified molecular analyses. 18, seven could be
identified comparison published sequences. twelve 18 molecularly
identified species (including unidentifiable species species thought to
be vectors) found pcr carry plasmodium sporozoites - compared four 
of eight morphological species. 15% morphologically identified anopheles
funestus mosquitoes insecticide resistance tests found other
species molecularly. comprehension primary secondary malaria vectors
and bionomic characteristics impact malaria transmission intervention
effectiveness fundamental achieving malaria elimination.
