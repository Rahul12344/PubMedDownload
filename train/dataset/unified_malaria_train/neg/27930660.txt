p. vivax p. falciparum parasites display different tropism host cells and
induce different clinical symptoms pathology, suggesting immune
responses required protection may differ two species. however, 
no study qualitatively compared immune responses p. falciparum p.
vivax humans following primary exposure infection. here, show 
two species differ terms cellular immune responses elicited following
primary infection. specifically, p. vivax induced expansion subset of
cd8+ cells expressing activation marker cd38, whereas p. falciparum induced
the expansion cd38+ cd4+ cells. cd38+ cd8+ cell population that
expanded following p. vivax infection displayed greater cytotoxic potential
compared cd38- cd8+ cells, compared cd38+ cd8+ cells circulating
during p. falciparum infection. hypothesize p. vivax infection leads a
stronger cd38+ cd8+ cell activation preferred tropism for
mhc-i-expressing reticulocytes that, unlike mature red blood cells, present
antigen directly cd8+ cells. study provides first line evidence 
to suggest effector role cd8+ cells p. vivax blood-stage immunity. it
is also first report species-specific differences subset cells
that expanded following primary plasmodium infection, suggesting malaria
vaccine development may require optimization according target
