small ubiquitin-related modifiers (sumos) post-translationally conjugated 
other proteins thereby essential regulators wide range cellular
processes. sumoylation, enzymes sumoylation pathway, conserved 
the malaria causing parasite, plasmodium falciparum. however, specific
functions sumoylation p. falciparum, degree functional
conservation enzymes human p. falciparum sumoylation pathways,
have characterized. here, demonstrate sumoylation levels peak
during midstages intra-erythrocyte developmental cycle, concomitant with
hemoglobin consumption elevated oxidative stress. vitro studies revealed
that p. falciparum e1- e2-conjugating enzymes interact effectively to
recognize modify rangap1, model mammalian sumo substrate. however, in
heterologous reactions, p. falciparum e1 e2 enzymes failed interact with
cognate human e2 e1 partners, respectively, modify rangap1. structural
analysis, binding studies, functional assays revealed divergent amino acid
residues within e1-e2 binding interface define organism-specific enzyme 
interactions. studies identify sumoylation potentially important
regulator oxidative stress response p. falciparum intra-erythrocyte
developmental cycle, define e1 e2 interactions promising target 
development parasite-specific inhibitors sumoylation parasite
replication.
