we applied "shotgun" approach based nanoliquid chromatography-high
resolution mass spectrometry associated label free quantification (lfq) to
identify proteins varying age, independently physiological state,
in aedes albopictus, mosquito species last decades invaded
temperate regions north america europe, creating concerns associated
high nuisance risk arbovirus transmission. combined "shotgun" lfq 
approach shown highly suitable simultaneously compare several
biological samples, needed study aimed analyze different age-groups
and physiological states adult mosquito females. results obtained
represent first wide-scale analysis protein expression ae. albopictus
females: >1000 665 proteins identified micrograms crude
protein extracts mosquito heads thoraxes, respectively. six these
proteins shown significantly vary 2- 16-day-old females,
independently physiological state (i.e. virgin, mated, host-seeking,
blood-fed, gravid).biological significance: mosquito-borne diseases, 
malaria, dengue arboviroses, persistent cause global mortality
and morbidity, affecting hundreds thousands people. billions people
living tropical areas risk bitten every day infective
mosquito female spread tropical species aedes albopictus to
temperate areas creating alarm northern hemisphere. mosquito longevity 
is critical factor affecting mosquito-borne pathogen transmission cycles and
the mosquito capacity transmit pathogens. however, large scale analyses the
age structure mosquito field populations hampered lack optimal
age-grading approaches. findings open new perspectives development of
reliable, simple cheap protein-based assays age-grade ae. albopictus
females and, likely, mosquito species higher medical relevance,
such main dengue vector, aedes aegypti, major afrotropical malaria
vectors. assays would greatly contribute epidemiological studies aimed
at defining actual vectorial capacity given mosquito species. moreover, 
they would valuable assessing effectiveness mosquito control
interventions based relative ratio young old individuals
before intervention.
