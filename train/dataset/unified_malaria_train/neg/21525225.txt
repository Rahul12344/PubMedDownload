accurate rapid diagnosis malaria infections crucial implementing
species-appropriate treatment saving lives. molecular diagnostic tools are
the accurate sensitive method detecting plasmodium, differentiating
between plasmodium species, detecting subclinical infections. despite
available whole-genome sequence data plasmodium falciparum p. vivax, 
majority pcr-based methods still rely 18s rrna gene targets.
historically, gene served best target diagnostic assays.
however, limited ability detect mixed infections multiplex
assay platforms without use nested pcr. new diagnostic targets needed.
ideal targets species specific, highly sensitive, amenable both
single-step multiplex pcrs. mined genomes p. falciparum p.
vivax identify species-specific, repetitive sequences serve new pcr
targets detection malaria. show targets (pvr47 and
pfr364) exist 14 41 copies sensitive 18s rrna when
utilized single-step pcr. parasites routinely detected levels 1 to
10 parasites/μl. reaction multiplexed detect species a

clinical isolates tanzania 10 p. vivax strains 96 p. vivax clinical 
isolates venezuela, verified sensitivity specificity of
∼100% targets compared nested 18s rrna approach. show that
bioinformatics approaches successfully applied identify novel
diagnostic targets improve molecular methods pathogen detection. these
novel targets provide powerful alternative molecular diagnostic method
