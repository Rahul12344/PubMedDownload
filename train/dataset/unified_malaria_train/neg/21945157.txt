research abo advanced significantly recent years. database was
established manage sequence information increasing number novel
alleles. genome sequencings identified abo orthologues paralogues in
various organisms enhanced knowledge evolution abo and
related genes. prominent advancements include clarification the
association abo different disease processes. instance, abo status
affects infectivity certain strains helicobacter pylori noroviruses
as well sequestration rosetting red blood cells infected with
plasmodium falciparum. genome-wide association studies conclusively linked
the abo locus pancreatic cancer, venous thromboembolism, myocardial
infarction presence coronary atherosclerosis. findings suggest
abo's important role determining individual's susceptibility such
diseases. furthermore, understanding structures b
transferases enzymology dramatically improved. abo also
become research subject neurobiology preparation of
artificial/universal blood became topic pseudoscience "blood type
diets." new progress, become evident abo critical
player modern era genomic medicine. article provides most
up-to-date information regarding abo genomics.
