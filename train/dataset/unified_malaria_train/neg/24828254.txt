background: dna vaccines provide high tolerability safety commonly suffer
from suboptimal immunogenicity. previously reported plasmid vector
(patrex), encoding dna sequence von willebrand i/a domain the
tumor endothelial marker-8 (tem8) given combination plasmid-encoded 
tumor antigens acted powerful molecular adjuvant enhancing immunity 
breast melanoma tumors.
aims: present study addressed two unsolved issues; would adjuvant
action patrex extend dna vaccine infectious disease and, so,
what mechanistic basis patrex adjuvant action?
results: show murine malaria vaccine model co-administration of
patrex potentiates antibody production elicited intramuscular injection 
plasmid encoding plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein 4/5 (pymsp4/5).
patrex enhanced b-cell response induced increased igg1 production
consistent th2 polarization dna vaccine response. explore the
mechanism adjuvant action, cells transfected vitro patrex and
this resulted formation insoluble intracellular aggregates apoptotic
cell death. using structural modeling approach identified short peptide
sequence (α3-β4) within atrex responsible protein aggregation confirmed
that transfection cells plasmid encoding self-assembling peptide
similarly triggered intracellular aggregates, caspase activation cell death.
conclusion: plasmids encoding aggregation-promoting domains induce formation of
insoluble intracellular aggregates trigger caspase activation apoptotic 
cell death leading activation innate immune system thereby acting as
genetic adjuvants.
