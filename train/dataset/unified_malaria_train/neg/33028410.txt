background: release gene-drive mutants suppress anopheles mosquito
reproduction promising method malaria control. however, many scientific, 
regulatory ethical questions remain transgenic mosquitoes be
utilised field. behavioural level, gene-drive carrying mutants should
be least sexually attractive wildtype populations compete
against, key element anopheles copulation acoustic courtship. 
analysed sound emissions acoustic preference doublesex mutant previously
used collapse anopheles gambiae (s.l.) cages.
methods: anopheles rely flight tones produced beating wings
for acoustic mating communication. assessed impact disrupting a
female-specific isoform doublesex gene (dsxf) wing beat frequency
(wbf; measured flight tone) males (xy) females (xx) homozygous dsxf-
mutants (dsxf-/-), heterozygous dsxf- carriers (dsxf+/-) g3 dsxf+ controls
(dsxf+/+). exclude non-genetic influences, controlled temperature and
wing length. used phonotaxis assay test acoustic preferences of
mutant control mosquitoes.
results: previous study showed altered phenotype dsxf-/- females,
who appear intersex, suggesting female-specific dsxf allele is
haplosufficient. identified significant, dose-dependent increases wbf
of dsxf-/- dsxf+/- females compared dsxf+/+ females. female wbfs 
remained significantly lower male equivalents, though. males showed stronger
phonotactic responses wbfs control dsxf+/+ females of
dsxf+/- dsxf-/- females. found evidence phonotaxis female
genotype. male genotypes displayed deviations controls.
conclusions: prerequisite anopheline copulation phonotactic
attraction males towards female flight tones within mating swarms. reductions 
in mutant acoustic attractiveness diminish mating efficiency thus the
efficacy population control efforts. caged population assessments may not
successfully reproduce natural mating scenarios. propose amend existing
testing protocols better reflect competition mutants target
populations. findings confirm dsxf disruption effect males;
for phenotypic traits, female wbfs, effects dsxf appear
dose-dependent rather haplosufficient.
