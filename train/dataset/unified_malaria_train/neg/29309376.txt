pyruvate kinase (pk) deficiency common defect glycolytic
pathway leading congenital hemolytic anemia. present case an
18-year-old boy chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, remarkable 
sensitivity heat. moreover, patient showed clinical impairment last
year. reason, excluded immunologic infectious nature (malaria,
babesia), may play role worsening anemia. red blood cell enzyme
assay showed presence significant increase enzyme activities,
except pk, suggesting pk deficiency patient. molecular analysis 
of pk-lr gene revealed presence novel homozygote missense mutation
(c.581g>c, p.arg194pro). mutant enzyme displayed heat instability. in
addition, analyzed bilirubin uridine diphosphate (udp)-glucuronosyltransferase
1a1 gene revealed heterozygous state ([ta]6/[ta]7). clear
diagnosis pk deficiency, patient underwent splenectomy.
