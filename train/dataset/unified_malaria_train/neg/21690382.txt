plasmodium yoelii excellent model studying malaria pathogenesis is
often intractable investigate using human parasites; however, genetic studies 
of parasite hindered lack genome-wide linkage resources.
here, performed 14 genetic crosses three pairs p. yoelii
clones/subspecies, isolated 75 independent recombinant progeny crosses, 
and constructed high-resolution linkage map parasite. microsatellite
genotypes progeny formed 14 linkage groups belonging 14 parasite 
chromosomes, allowing assignment sequence contigs chromosomes.
growth-related virulent phenotypes 25 progeny one crosses were
significantly associated major locus chromosome 13 two
secondary loci chromosomes 7 10. chromosome 10 13 loci both
linked day 5 parasitemia, effects parasite growth rate are
independent additive. locus chromosome 7 associated day 10
parasitemia. chromosome 13 locus spans ~220 kb dna containing 51 predicted
genes, including p. yoelii erythrocyte binding ligand, c741y
substitution r6 domain implicated change growth rate.
similarly, chromosome 10 locus spans ~234 kb 71 candidate genes,
containing member 235-kda rhoptry proteins (py235) bind 
erythrocyte surface membrane. atypical virulent phenotypes among progeny were
also observed. study provides critical tools information genetic
investigations virulence biology p. yoelii.
