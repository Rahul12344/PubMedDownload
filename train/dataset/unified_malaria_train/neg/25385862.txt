in study, three molecular assays (real-time multiplex polymerase chain
reaction [pcr], merozoite surface antigen gene [msp]-multiplex pcr, the
plasmonex multiplex pcr kit) developed diagnosis plasmodium
species. total, 52 microscopy-positive 20 malaria-negative samples were
used study. found real-time multiplex pcr sensitive 
for detecting p. falciparum p. knowlesi. msp-multiplex pcr assay 
plasmonex multiplex pcr kit equally sensitive diagnosing p. knowlesi
infection, whereas plasmonex multiplex pcr kit real-time multiplex pcr
showed similar sensitivity detecting p. vivax. three molecular assays
displayed 100% specificity detecting malaria samples. observed no
significant differences msp-multiplex pcr plasmonex multiplex pcr
kit (mcnemar's test: p = 0.1489). however, significant differences observed 
comparing real-time multiplex pcr plasmonex multiplex pcr kit (mcnemar's
test: p = 0.0044) real-time multiplex pcr msp-multiplex pcr (mcnemar's
test: p = 0.0012).
