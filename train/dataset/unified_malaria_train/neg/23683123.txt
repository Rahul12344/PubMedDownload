in many organisms chromosome initiates sex determination regulates male
fertility mating behaviour. however, molecular characterization genes is
rare outside model species difficult clone analyse 
repeat-rich heterochromatic sequences. insects, genes well
characterized small number drosophila species. report the
discovery guy1 (gene unique y), gene unique chromosome in
the asian malaria mosquito, anopheles stephensi, using approach compares 
illumina sequences separately obtained male female genomic dna.
experimental evidence confirmed guy1 single copy gene found the
y chromosome. guy1 transcribed onset zygotic transcription 
encodes small lysine-rich protein forms two alpha helices shows
dna-binding properties. interestingly, three helix-loop-helix proteins key
factors determine sex early embryo drosophila melanogaster. single
embryo analysis indicated guy1 transcribed male embryos 
the guy1 promoter functional early embryos. guy1 may used a
paternally inherited molecular marker. investigation guy1 will
contribute genetic approaches control mosquito-borne diseases.
