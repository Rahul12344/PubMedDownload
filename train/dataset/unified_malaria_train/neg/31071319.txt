plasmodium vivax key obstacle malaria elimination asia latin
america, largely attributed ability form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper
cells) host liver escape treatment cause relapsing infections.
the decision form hypnozoites made early liver infection may
already set sporozoites prior invasion. better understand early
stages infection, undertook comprehensive transcriptomic histone
epigenetic characterization p. vivax sporozoites. comparisons with
recently published proteomic data p. vivax sporozoite, study found
that although highly transcribed, transcripts associated functions needed
for early infection vertebrate host detectable proteins may
be regulated translational repression. identified differential
transcription sporozoite published transcriptomes asexual
blood stages mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. comparisons
point multiple layers transcriptional, post-transcriptional and
post-translational control appear active sporozoites lesser
extent hypnozoites, largely absent replicating liver schizonts or
mixed blood stages. also characterised histone epigenetic modifications the
p. vivax sporozoite explored role regulating transcription.
collectively, data support hypothesis sporozoite tightly 
programmed stage infect human host identify mechanisms hypnozoite 
formation may explored liver stage models.
