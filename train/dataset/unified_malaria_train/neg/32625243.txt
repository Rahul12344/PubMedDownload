background: artemisinin-based combination therapy become preferred
approach treating malaria successfully reduced malaria-related
mortality. currently, main source artemisinin artemisia annua l., and
thus, strategic importance enhance artemisinin contents a. annua
plants. phytohormones illumination known important external
environmental factor notable effects production secondary
metabolite. activities different hormones influenced varying
degrees light, thus light hormones may jointly regulate various
processes plants. here, performed transcriptome metabolome analyses
revealed ultraviolet b irradiation phytohormone gibberellins
coordinately promoted accumulation artemisinin artemisia annua.
methods: artemisinin analysis performed ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (uplc-esi-qqq-ms/ms). rna
sequencing, go kegg enrichment analysis applied analyzing the
differentially expressed genes (degs) ultraviolet b irradiation and
gibberellins treatments. weighted gene co-expression network (wgcna) analyzed the
genes artemisinin‑related modules identified candidate hub genes 
modules.
results: study, found cross-talk uv-b ga induced
processes leading modifications artemisinin accumulation. total 14,762
genes differentially expressed (degs) among different treatments identified 
by transcriptome analysis. uv-b ga treatments enhanced accumulation of
artemisinin up-regulating expression key artemisinin biosynthesis
genes ads cyp71av1. according high degree value high expression
level, total 84 co-expressed transcription factors identified. among
them, myb nac tfs mainly involved regulating biosynthesis of
artemisinin. weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed ga + uv
in blue modules positively correlated artemisinin synthesis, suggesting 
that candidate hub genes modules up-regulated enhance
artemisinin synthesis response ga + uv treatment.
conclusion: study demonstrated co-regulation artemisinin biosynthetic 
pathway genes ultraviolet b irradiation phytohormone gibberellins
treatment. co-expression analysis revealed selected myb nac 
tfs might regulated artemisinin biosynthesis gene expression ads
and cyp71av1 genes. weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that
ga + uv treatment blue modules positively correlated artemisinin
synthesis. established network distinguish candidate hub genes blue 
modules might up-regulated enhance artemisinin synthesis response to
ga + uv treatment.
