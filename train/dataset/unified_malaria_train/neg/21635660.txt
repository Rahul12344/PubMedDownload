avian malaria (plasmodium spp.) implicated decline avian
populations hawaiian islands generally agreed that
geographically isolated immunologically naïve bird populations are
particularly vulnerable pathogenic effects invasive malaria parasites. 
in order assess potential disease risk malaria avifauna of
socorro island, méxico, surveyed plasmodium isolates 1,300 resident
field-caught mosquitoes. identified aedes (ochlerotatus)
taeniorhynchus (wiedemann, 1821), abundant salt marshes. we
also collected culex quinquefasciatus say, 1823 close human dwellings.
mitochondrial nd5 coii gene sequences ae. taeniorhynchus analyzed and
compared corresponding sequences mosquitoes galápagos islands, latin
america, north american mainland. aedes lineages socorro island
clustered closely lineage continental u.s. plasmodium spp.
dna isolated species mosquitoes. 38 positive pools, we
isolated 11 distinct mitochondrial cytb lineages plasmodium spp. seven 
plasmodium lineages represent previously documented avian infective strains while
four new lineages. results confirm potential risk spread of
avian malaria underscore need monitor mosquito avian
populations necessary conservation measure protect endangered bird
species socorro island.
