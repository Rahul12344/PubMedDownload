human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) major cause disease immunocompromised
individuals common cause congenital infection neurosensorial 
disease. expanding target populations hcmv antiviral treatment along with
the limitations currently available hcmv dna polymerase inhibitors
underscore need new antiviral agents alternative modes action.
the antimalarial artemisinin derivative artesunate shown inhibit hcmv in
vitro yet demonstrated limited antiviral efficacy vivo, prompting our
search potent anti-hcmv artemisinin derivatives. show the
innovative artemisinin derivative artemisone, screened its
activity malaria parasites human clinical studies, potent and
noncytotoxic inhibitor hcmv. artemisone exhibited antiviral efficacy
comparable ganciclovir (50% effective concentration, 1.20 ± 0.46 μm)
in human foreskin fibroblasts, enhanced relative potency lung fibroblasts
and epithelial cells. significantly, antiviral efficacy artemisone was
consistently ≥10-fold superior artesunate cells. artemisone
effectively inhibited laboratory-adapted low-passage-number clinical
strains, well drug-resistant hcmv strains. using quantitative viral
kinetics gene expression studies, show artemisone reversible
inhibitor targeting earlier phase viral replication cycle than
ganciclovir. importantly, artemisone effectively inhibited hcmv infection ex
vivo clinically relevant multicellular model integral human placental
tissues maintained organ culture. promising findings encourage preclinical
and clinical studies artemisone new inhibitor hcmv.
