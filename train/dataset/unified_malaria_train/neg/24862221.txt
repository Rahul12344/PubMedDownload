the genus plasmodium diversified group parasites 200 known
species includes causing malaria humans. parasites use
numerous proteins complex process allows invade red blood
cells vertebrate hosts. many proteins part multi-gene
families; one merozoite surface protein-3 (msp3) family. msp3
multi-gene family considered important two main human parasites,
plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum, paralogs simultaneously
expressed blood stage (merozoite) immunogenic. large
differences among plasmodium species number paralogs family.
such differences previously explained, part, adaptations that
allow different plasmodium species invade hosts. investigate
this, characterized array containing msp3 genes among several plasmodium
species, including p. falciparum p. vivax. first found evidence
indicating msp3 family p. falciparum homologous p.
vivax. subsequently, focusing diverse clade nonhuman primate
parasites p. vivax closely related, homology evident, we
found evidence indicating interspecies variation number of
paralogs adaptation related changes host range host switches.
overall, hypothesize evolution msp3 family p. vivax is
consistent model multi-allelic diversifying selection the
paralogs may functionally redundant roles terms increasing antigenic
diversity. thus, suggest expressed msp3 proteins could serve as
"decoys", via antigenic diversity, critical process invading the
host red blood cells.
