background: ability malaria (plasmodium) parasites adjust investment
into sexual transmission stages versus asexually replicating stages well
known, plasticity traits underpinning replication rate of
asexual stages blood received less attention. traits include
burst size (the number merozoites produced per schizont), duration 
asexual cycle, invasion preference different ages red blood cell
(rbc).
methods: here, plasticity [environment (e) effects] genetic variation
[genotype (g) effects] traits relating asexual replication rate are
examined 4 genotypes rodent malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi. an
experiment tested whether asexual dynamics differ parasites infecting
control versus anaemic hosts, whether variation replication rate be
explained differences burst size, asexual cycle, invasion rates.
results: within-host environment affected trait different extents but
generally similar impacts across genotypes. dynamics asexual densities
exhibited genotype by environment effect (g×e), one genotypes
increased replication rate others anaemic hosts. burst size 
cycle duration varied genotypes (g), burst size increased and
cycle duration became longer anaemic hosts (e). variation invasion rates of
differently aged rbcs explained environmental genetic effects.
plasticity burst size genotype traits making significant
contributions increase asexual densities observed anaemic hosts,
together explaining 46.4% variation replication rate.
conclusions: host anaemia induces several species malaria parasites to
alter conversion rate well documented. here, previously unknown plasticity 
other traits underpinning asexual replication revealed. findings
contribute mounting evidence malaria parasites deploy suite of
sophisticated strategies maximize fitness coping with, exploiting the
opportunities provided by, variable within-host conditions experienced during
infections. genetic variation genotype by environment interactions also 
shape traits highlights evolutionary potential. asexual replication
rate major determinant virulence so, understanding evolution of
virulence requires knowledge ecological (within-host environment) and
genetic drivers variation among parasites.
