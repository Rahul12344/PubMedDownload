when introduced 1990s, immunization dna plasmids considered
potentially revolutionary vaccine development, particularly vaccines
intended induce protective cd8 cell responses multiple antigens. 
conducted, 1997-1998, first clinical trial healthy humans dna
vaccine, single plasmid encoding plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein
(pfcsp), initial step toward developing multi-antigen malaria vaccine
targeting liver stages parasite. next step, conducted in
2000-2001 clinical trial five-plasmid mixture called mustdo5 encoding
pre-erythrocytic antigens pfcsp, pfssp2/trap, pfexp1, pflsa1 pflsa3.
thirty-two, malaria-naïve, adult volunteers enrolled sequentially four 
cohorts receiving mixture 500 μg plasmid plus escalating doses (0,
20, 100 500 μg) sixth plasmid encoding human granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hgm-csf). three doses formulation
were administered intramuscularly needle-less jet injection 0, 4 8
weeks, cohort controlled human malaria infection administered by
five mosquito bites 18 later. vaccine safe well-tolerated, inducing
moderate antigen-specific, mhc-restricted cell interferon-γ responses no
antibodies. although volunteers protected, cell responses boosted 
post malaria challenge. trial demonstrated mustdo5 dna hgm-csf
plasmids safe modestly immunogenic cell responses. also laid
the foundation priming dna plasmids boosting recombinant
viruses, approach known nearly 15 enhance immunogenicity and
protective efficacy dna vaccines.
