background: latter half natural 48-h intraerythrocytic life
cycle human plasmodium falciparum infection, parasites sequester deep in
endothelium tissues, away spleen inaccessible peripheral
blood. late-stage parasites may cause tissue damage likely contribute
to clinical disease, complete understanding biology is
needed. life cycle stages easily sampled due deep tissue
sequestration, measuring vivo gene expression parasites trophozoite 
and schizont stages challenge.
methods: developed custom ncounter® gene expression platform used this
platform measure malaria parasite gene expression profiles vitro in
vivo. also used imputation generate global transcriptional profiles and
assessed differential gene expression parasites growing vitro and
those recovered malaria-infected patient tissues collected autopsy.
results: demonstrate, first time, global transcriptional expression
profiles vivo malaria parasites sequestered human tissues. found
that parasite physiology correlated vitro data existing
life cycle data set, parasites sequestered tissues show expected
schizont-like transcriptional profile, conserved across tissues the
same patient. imputation based 60 landmark genes generated global
transcriptional profiles highly correlated genome-wide expression 
patterns samples measured microarray. finally, differential
expression revealed limited set vivo upregulated transcripts, may
indicate unique parasite genes involved human clinical infections.
conclusions: study highlights utility custom ncounter® p. falciparum
probe set, validation imputation within plasmodium species, documentation 
of vivo schizont-stage expression patterns human tissues.
