background:  analysis genome-wide polymorphism many organisms potential
to identify genes recent selection. however, data historical allele
frequency changes rarely available direct confirmation.
methods:  we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) 4 plasmodium
falciparum drug resistance genes 668 archived parasite-positive blood samples 
of gambian population 1984 2008. covered period before
antimalarial resistance detected locally, subsequent failure of
multiple drugs introduction artemisinin combination therapy. we
separately performed genome-wide sequence analysis 52 clinical isolates from
2008 prospect loci recent directional selection.
results:  resistance alleles increased low frequencies, peaking 2000
for chloroquine resistance-associated crt mdr1 genes end the
survey period dhfr dhps genes respectively associated pyrimethamine 
and sulfadoxine resistance. temporal changes fit model incorporating likely
selection coefficients period. three drug resistance loci in
the top 4 regions strong selection implicated genome-wide analysis.
conclusions:  genome-wide polymorphism analysis endemic population sample
robustly identifies loci detailed documentation recent selection,
demonstrating power prospectively detect emerging drug resistance genes.
