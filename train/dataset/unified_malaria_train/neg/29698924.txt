almost invariably, humans become ill primary infections malaria
parasites pathology associated oxidative stress perturbations
in metabolism. importantly, repetitive exposure plasmodium results in
asymptomatic infections, condition defined clinical tolerance.
integration transcriptomics metabolomics data provides powerful way to
investigate complex disease processes involving oxidative stress, energy
metabolism immune cell activation. used metabolomics transcriptomics
to investigate different clinical outcomes p. vivax controlled human
malaria infection trial. baseline, naïve semi-immune subjects differed
in expression interferon related genes, neutrophil b cell signatures
that progressed distinct kinetics infection. metabolomics data
indicated differences amino acid pathways lipid metabolism two
groups. top pathways course infection included methionine and
cysteine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism urea cycle. also evidence
for activation lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase non-specific lipid
peroxidation products semi-immune group. integration of
transcriptomics metabolomics revealed concerted molecular events triggered by
the infection, notably involving platelet activation, innate immunity cell 
signaling. additional experiment confirmed metabolites associated with
platelet activation genes indeed enriched platelet metabolome.
