real-time pcr, also called quantitative pcr (qpcr), powerful analytical 
tool detection nucleic acids since developed. biological
research also diagnostic needs, qpcr technique requires capacity to
detect multiple genes recent years. solid phase pcr (sp-pcr) one two 
directional primers immobilized solid substrates could analyze multiplex
genetic targets. however, conventional sp-pcr subjected restriction of
application lack pcr efficiency quantitative resolution. we
introduce advanced qpcr primer-incorporated network (pin). one
directional primers immobilized porous hydrogel particle covalent
bond direction primers temporarily immobilized so-called 
'supplimers'. supplimers released primers aqueous phase hydrogel at
the thermal cycling pcr. induced high pcr efficiency 92% high
reliability. reduced formation primer dimers improved the
selectivity qpcr thanks strategy 'right primers supplied right
place only'. conducting six-plex qpcr 30 minutes, analyzed dna samples
originated malaria patients successfully identified malaria species a
single reaction.
