genotyping sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) genes help identifying 
genes drug selection emergence resistance dhfr dhps
genes. india important hotspot studying malaria due immense
climatic diversity prevalent country. central eastern parts the
country vulnerable sites malaria cases reported throughout the
year. different regions country 173 field isolates genotyped 
various loci dhfr dhps genes collected 1994 2013. this
encompasses period antimalarial resistance emerged period
after use combination therapy made mandatory country. we
observed rise resistant sp alleles low frequencies (in year 
1994) steadily rising (in year 2000) maintaining increasing trend
subsequently (in year 2013) shown sequence analysis dhfr and
dhps genes. study assessed prevalence mutations dhfr dhps
genes associated sp resistance samples indicative increase in
resistance levels plasmodium falciparum sp even change malaria
treatment policy country.
