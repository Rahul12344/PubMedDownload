members plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein (pvrbp) family are
believed mediate specific invasion reticulocytes p. vivax. this
study, performed molecular characterization genes encoding members 
protein family. cdna sequencing, constructed full-length gene models
and verified genes protein coding pseudogenes. we
also used quantitative pcr measure vivo transcript abundances in
clinical p. vivax isolates. like genes encoding related invasion ligands p.
falciparum, pvrbp expression levels vary broadly across different parasite
isolates. antibody measurements, found host immune pressure may
be driving force behind distinctly high diversity one family
members, pvrbp2c. mild yet significant negative correlation found between
parasitemia pvrbp2b antibody level, suggesting antibodies the
protein may interfere invasion.
