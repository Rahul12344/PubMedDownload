the deployment transgenic mosquitoes carrying genes refractoriness to
malaria long seen futuristic scenario riddled technical
difficulties. integration anti-malarial effector genes gene-drive
system mosquito genome without affecting mosquito fitness recognized 
as critical success malaria control strategy. conducted
detailed fitness studies two anopheles gambiae s.s. transgenic lines recently 
developed using two-phase targeted genetic transformation system. replicated
cage-invasion experiments, males females ee phase-1 docking strain and
evida3 phase-2 strain loaded antimicrobial peptide (amp) expressed upon
blood-feeding, mixed individuals recently-colonized strain 
mopti chromosomal form. experimental design enabled us detect initial
strain reproductive success differences, assortative mating hybrid vigor that
may characterize mosquito release situations. addition, potential fitness 
costs unloaded phase-1 loaded phase-2 genetic constructs, independent 
of strains' original genetic backgrounds, estimated 1(st)
instar larvae, pupae adult stages 10 generations. phase-1 unloaded
docking cassette found significantly lower allelic fitness relative
to wild type allele larval development. however, overall genotypic
fitness comparable wild type allele across stages leading to
stable equilibrium replicates. contrast, phase-2 construct
expressing evida3 disappeared replicates within 10 generations due to
lower fitness hemi- homozygous larvae, suggesting costly background amp
expression and/or dsred2 marker. first study effectively
partition independent fitness stage-specific determinants unloaded loaded 
transgenic strains phase-1-2 transformation system. critically, high
fitness phase-1 docking strain makes ideal model system for
measuring genetic load novel candidate anti-malarial molecules vivo.
