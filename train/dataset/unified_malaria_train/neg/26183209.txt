purpose review: review, discuss field engineered
humoral immunity emphasis recent work using viral vectors produce
antibodies vivo. alternative passive transfer monoclonal antibody 
protein, transgene encoding antibody delivered cells via vector
transduction, resulting expression secretion host cell. review
will summarize evidence support strategy alternative to
traditional vaccines infection novel therapeutics variety of
diseases.
recent findings: historically, humoral immunity engineered through
vaccination passive transfer monoclonal antibodies. however, recent work
suggests vectors used deliver transgenes encoding broadly
neutralizing antibodies non-hematopoietic tissues mediate long-term
expression capable preventing treating infectious diseases. the
production engineered monoclonal antibodies allows precise targeting and
elimination aberrant self-proteins characteristic certain
neurodegenerative disease. approach also successfully used to
combat cancer addiction several animal models. despite wide array of
expression platforms described, adeno-associated virus vectors
have emerged frontrunner rapid clinical translation.
summary: recent advances vector-mediated antibody expression demonstrated
the potential interventions prevent infection treat disease. as
such, offers alternative immunogen-based vaccine design novel
therapeutic intervention enabling precise manipulation humoral immunity.
success translating approaches patients may enable development of
effective prevention previously intractable pathogens evade immunity
such hiv, influenza, malaria hcv may also enable new treatment options 
for neurodegenerative diseases alzheimer's disease.
