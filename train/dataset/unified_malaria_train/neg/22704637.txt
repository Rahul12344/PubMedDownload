background: estimation plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia vary the
method used time sampling. quantitative real time pcr (qpcr) whole
blood plasma samples previously shown sensitive thick
film microscopy. however efficiencies method compared
using samples obtained infants less one year old.
methods: multiple statistical approaches used compare the
performance qpcr whole blood plasma detect 18 s ribosomal gene of
p. falciparum 548 samples children aged 2.5 24 months. parasite
prevalence matched samples compared using mcnemar's test agreement 
positive results quantified kappa scores. parasite prevalences between
different age groups compared fisher's test. results analyses by
thick film microscopy also available children 24 months their
correlation qpcr method examined spearman's test. finally the
association p. falciparum infection incidence multiple malaria
episodes contact 24 months age evaluated using negative binomial
regression.
results: analyses showed qpcr whole blood detected approximately 
3-fold cases infection plasma qpcr. qpcr methods agreed well
with although qpcr plasma greater agreement microscopy
(96.85%) qpcr blood (69.7%). 24 months prevalence of
infection detected methods associated anaemia (p<0.05).
conclusions: data presented demonstrates low levels parasitaemia
are better detected qpcr using parasite dna whole blood plasma.
however plasma samples provide viable substitute parasite smears are
unavailable.
