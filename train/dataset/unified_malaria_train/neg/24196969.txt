genome sequencing revealed extreme at-rich genome profusion of
asparagine repeats associated low complexity regions (lcrs) proteins of
the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum. despite abundance, the
function lcrs remains unclear. occur almost families
of plasmodial proteins, occurrence lcrs cannot associated any
specific metabolic pathway; yet accumulation must given selective
advantages parasite. translation asparagine-rich lcrs demands
extraordinarily high amounts asparaginylated trna(asn). however, unlike 
organisms, plasmodium codon bias correlated trna gene copy number.
here, studied trna(asn) accumulation well catalytic capacities of
the asparaginyl-trna synthetase parasite vitro. observed that
asparaginylation parasite considered standard, expected
to limit availability asparaginylated trna(asn) cell and, turn, 
slow ribosomal translation rate decoding asparagine repeats. this
observation strengthens earlier hypothesis considering asparagine rich
sequences act "trna sponges" help cotranslational folding parasite
proteins. however, also raises many questions mechanistic aspects of
the synthesis asparagine repeats implications global
control protein expression throughout plasmodium life cycle.
