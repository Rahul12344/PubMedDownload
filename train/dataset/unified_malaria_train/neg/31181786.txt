negative duffy expression surface human red blood cells believed to
be barrier plasmodium vivax infection africans. however, p. vivax
has demonstrated infect duffy-negative individuals several central and
east african countries. study, investigated distribution duffy 
blood group phenotypes regard p. vivax infection parasitemia in
sudan. 992 microscopic-positive malaria samples, 190 identified p.
vivax positive infections. among them, 186 p. vivax mono-infections 4
were mixed p. vivax plasmodium falciparum infections. subset 77 samples 
was estimated parasitemia quantitative real-time pcr. duffy codons were
sequenced 190 p. vivax positive samples. found duffy
fy(a-b+) phenotype prevalent, accounting 67.9% p. vivax
infections, homozygous duffy-negative fy(a-b-) accounted 17.9% the
p. vivax infections. prevalence infection fy(a-b+) fy(a+b-)were
significantly higher fy(a-b-) phenotypes (p = 0.01 p < 0.01,
respectively). significantly low proportion p. vivax infection observed 
in duffy negative individuals fy(a-b-). study highlights prevalence of
p. vivax duffy-negatives sudan indicates low parasitemia among the
duffy-negative individuals.
