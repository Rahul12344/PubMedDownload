dendritic cells (dcs) activated pathogens initiate shape immune
responses. found activation dcs plasmodium falciparum, main
causative agent human malaria, induces highly unusual phenotype dcs
up-regulate costimulatory molecules secretion chemokines, of

malaria-experienced donors mali. contact-dependent cross-talk the

chemokine ifn-α secretion response parasite. despite absence of
inflammatory cytokine secretion, mdcs incubated p. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes activated antigen-specific naïve cd4+ cells proliferate and
secrete th1-like cytokines. unexpected response human mdcs p.
falciparum exhibited transcriptional program distinct classical lps
response, pointing unique p. falciparum-induced activation pathways may
explain uncharacteristic immune response malaria.
