background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency x-linked
genetic disorder results impaired enzyme activity. although g6pd
deficiency globally distributed prevalent malaria-endemic
countries. several mutations identified g6pd gene, alter
enzyme activity. g6pd genotype predominantly found sub-saharan africa is
the g6pdb (g6pd376a) (g6pd376g) g6pda- (g6pd376g/202a, g6pd376g/542t,
g6pd376g/680t g6pd376g/968c) occurring lower frequencies.
aim: aim study identify prevalence g6pd deficiency 
asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum carriage children living southern ghana 
and determine whether g6pd deficiency influences asymptomatic carriage p.
falciparum parasites.
methods: blood samples obtained month 170 healthy ghanaian
school children aged 5 12 years basic schools two communities
obom abura similar rainfall patterns malaria peak seasons. g6pd
enzyme activity assessed using qualitative g6pd rdt kit (accessbio). g6pd
genotyping asymptomatic parasite carriage determined pcr followed by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) dna extracted dried blood
spots.
results: sub-saharan g6pd a- allele detected a376g/g202a found
in 12.4 % (21/170), children distributed 4.1 % (7/170) a-, 1.8 %
(3/170) a-/a- homozygous deficient males females 6.5 % (11/170) a/a- 
b/a- heterozygous deficient females. phenotypically, 10.6 % (15/142) the
children g6pd deficient. asymptomatic carriage p. falciparum pcr
was 50, 29.4, 38.2 38.8 % months february may 2015,
respectively, 28.8, 22.4, 25.9 5.9 % microscopy same
periods.
conclusions: g6pd deficiency significantly associated lowered risk 
pcr-estimated asymptomatic p. falciparum carriage children peak
malaria season southern ghana.
