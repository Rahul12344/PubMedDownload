malaria one world's devastating diseases, particularly the
tropics. humans, plasmodium falciparum lives mainly within red blood cells,
and malaria pathogenesis depends red blood cells infected the
parasite. nonesterified fatty acids (nefas), including cis-9-octadecenoic acid,
and phospholipids critical complete parasite growth serum-free
culture, although efficacy nefas sustaining growth p. falciparum
has varied markedly. hexadecanoic acid trans-9-octadecenoic acid have
arrested development parasite, association down-regulation of
genes encoding copper-binding proteins. selective removal cu+ ions has
blockaded completely ring-trophozoite-schizont progression parasite.
the importance copper homeostasis developmental progression p.
falciparum confirmed inhibition copper-binding proteins that
regulate copper physiology function associating copper ions. these
data provided strong evidence link healthy copper homeostasis 
and successive developmental progression p. falciparum. perturbation copper
homeostasis may be, thus, instrumental drug vaccine development the
malaria medication. review importance copper homeostasis asexual
growth p. falciparum relation nefas, copperbinding proteins, apoptosis, 
mitochondria, gene expression.
