background: human population movement across country borders presents real
challenge malaria control elimination efforts cambodia its
neighbouring countries. quantify plasmodium infection among the
border-crossing population, including asymptomatic artemisinin resistant (ar)
parasites, three official border crossing points, one cambodia's
borders thailand, laos vietnam, selected sampling.
methods findings: total 3206 participants (of 4110 approached) were
recruited crossed border, tested malaria interviewed. by
real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), 5.4% screened individuals
were found harbour plasmodium parasites. proportion highest the
laos border (11.5%). overall 97 p. vivax (55.7%), 55 p. falciparum
(31.6%), two p. malariae (1.1%) 20 mixed infections (11.5%). identified
infections, 20% febrile time screening. 24 p.
falciparum samples pcr possible assess ar, 15 (62.5%) 
mutations k13 propeller domain gene, participants laos
border point. malaria rapid diagnostic test (rdt) pldh/hrp-2 identified a
positivity rate 3.2% overall sensitivity compared rt-pcr low
(43.1%). main individual risk factors infection included sex, fever, 
forest-goer, poor knowledge malaria prevention methods previous malaria
infection. occupation, day week time crossing (morning vs.
afternoon) also appeared play important role predicting positive cases.
conclusions: study offers novel approach identify asymptomatic
infections monitor ar parasite flow among mobile migrant populations
crossing borders. similar screening activities recommended identify
other hot borders characterise potential hot spots ar. targeted
"customised" interventions surveillance activities implemented in
these sites accelerate elimination efforts region.
