the discovery chromera velia, free-living photosynthetic relative of
apicomplexan pathogens, provided unexpected opportunity study algal
ancestry malaria parasites. work, compared molecular footprints
of eukaryote-to-eukaryote endosymbiosis c. velia equivalents in
peridinin-containing dinoflagellates (pcd) reevaluate recent claims favor
of common ancestry plastids. end, established draft
genome set full-length cdna sequences c. velia via next-generation 
sequencing. documented presence single coxi gene mitochondrial
genome, thus represents genetically reduced aerobic organelle
identified far, focused analyses five "lucky genes" calvin
cycle. selected known support common origin 
complex plastids cryptophytes, alveolates (represented pcds),
stramenopiles, haptophytes (cash) via single secondary endosymbiosis a
red alga. expected, broadly sampled phylogenies nuclear-encoded
calvin cycle markers support rhodophycean origin complex plastid of
chromera. however, also suggest independent origin apicomplexan and
dinophycean (pcd) plastids via two eukaryote-to-eukaryote endosymbioses. although
at odds current view common photosynthetic ancestry alveolates,
this conclusion nonetheless line deviant plastome architecture 
dinoflagellates morphological paradox four versus three plastid
membranes respective lineages. support independent
endosymbioses provided analysis five additional markers, four them
involved plastid protein import machinery. finally, introduce the
"rhodoplex hypothesis" convenient way designate evolutionary scenarios
where cash plastids ultimately product single secondary
endosymbiosis red alga subsequently horizontally spread via
higher-order eukaryote-to-eukaryote endosymbioses.
