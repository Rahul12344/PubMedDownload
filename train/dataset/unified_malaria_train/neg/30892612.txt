genomic maps dna g-quadruplexes (g4s) help elucidate roles 
secondary structures play various organisms. herein, employ improved
version g-quadruplex sequencing method (g4-seq) generate whole genome g4 
maps 12 species include widely studied model organisms also
pathogens clinical relevance. identify g4 structures form under
physiological k+ conditions also g4s stabilized g4-targeting 
small molecule pyridostatin (pds). discuss various structural features 
the experimentally observed g-quadruplexes (oqs), highlighting differences in
their prevalence enrichment across species. study describes diversity 
sequence composition genomic location oqs different species
and reveals enrichment oqs gene promoters particular mammals
such mouse human, among species studied. multi-species maps have
been made publicly available resource research community. maps
can serve blueprints biological experiments model organisms,
where g4 structures may play role.
