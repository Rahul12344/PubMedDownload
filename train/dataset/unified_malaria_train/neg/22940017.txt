the proportion plasmodium vivax-infected subjects carry mature
gametocytes, thus potentially infectious, remains poorly characterized in
endemic settings. here, describe quantitative reverse transcriptase (rt)
real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) targets transcripts mature
gametocyte-specific pvs25 gene. found mature gametocytes 42 44 (95.4%)
p. vivax infections diagnosed ongoing cohort study northwestern
brazil. sybr green qrt-pcr sensitive conventional rt-pcr that
targets gene. molecular detection gametocytes failed, however, when
dried bloodspots used rna isolation complementary dna synthesis.
estimating number pvs25 gene transcripts allowed examining the
potential infectiousness gametocyte carriers quantitative way. found
that (61.9%) gametocyte carriers either asymptomatic subpatent
parasitemias would missed routine malaria control strategies.
however, potentially undiagnosed gametocyte carriers usually low-density
infections contributed small fraction (up 4%) overall gametocyte 
burden community. studies required determine relative
contribution malaria transmission long-lasting low-density
gametocytemias asymptomatic carriers left undiagnosed untreated.
