background: plasmodium knowlesi parasite macaques currently 
common cause human malaria malaysia. thrombospondin-related adhesive
protein (trap) gene pre-erythrocytic stage antigen. well-characterized
vaccine candidate plasmodium vivax plasmodium falciparum, however, no
study done orthologous gene p. knowlesi. study
investigates nucleotide diversity, haplotypes, natural selection population
differentiation full-length pktrap genes clinical samples malaysia.
methods: forty full-length pktrap sequences clinical isolates malaysia
along reference h-strain downloaded published databases.
genetic diversity, polymorphism, haplotype natural selection determined 
using dnasp 5.10 software. mcdonald-kreitman test conducted using p. vivax
and plasmodium coatneyi ortholog sequence dnasp 5.10 software. population
genetic differentiation index (fst) parasite populations determined using 
arlequin v3.5. phylogenetic relationships trap ortholog genes were
determined using mega 5.0 software.
results: comparison 40 full-length pktrap sequences along h-strain
identified 74 snps (53 non-synonymous 21 synonymous substitutions) resulting 
in 29 haplotypes. analysis full-length gene showed nucleotide
diversity lower compared nearest ortholog pvtrap. domain-wise analysis
indicated proline/asparagine rich region higher nucleotide diversity
compared von willebrand factor domain thrombospondin-type-1
domain. mcdonald-kreitman test identified ratio number of
nonsynonymous synonymous polymorphic sites within p. knowlesi was
significantly higher number nonsynonymous synonymous fixed
sites p. knowlesi p. vivax. von willebrand factor domain also
indicated balancing selection using mk test, however, give significant
results tested p. coatneyi outgroup. phylogenetic analysis of
full-length genes identified three distinct sub-clusters p. knowlesi, one
originating peninsular malaysia two originating malaysian borneo.
high population differentiation values observed within samples from
peninsular malaysia malaysian borneo.
conclusions: study first report genetic diversity and
natural selection full-length pktrap. low level genetic diversity found
across full-length gene pktrap. balancing selection von willebrand 
factor domain indicated trap could target inducing immune response
against p. knowlesi infections. however, higher number samples would be
necessary confirm findings.
