erythrocyte-binding antigens (ebas) p. falciparum reticulocyte-binding
homologue proteins (pfrhs) two important protein families vary in
expression utilization p. falciparum evade inhibitory antibodies. we
evaluated antibodies repeated time-points among individuals living an
endemic region nigeria almost one year vaccine candidates. 
antibody levels eba140, eba175, eba181, pfrh2, pfrh4, msp2, were
measured elisa. also used parasites disrupted eba140, eba175 and
eba181 genes show targets invasion inhibitory
antibodies. however, antigenic targets inhibitory antibodies stable
and changed substantially time individuals, independent age.
antibodies levels measured elisa also varied within individuals
over time antibodies eba181, pfrh2 msp2 declined rapidly
in younger individuals (â‰¤15 years) compared older (>15). breadth high
antibody responses time influenced age frequency 
infection. high antibody levels associated stable invasion
inhibitory response, could indicate long process of
formation immunity, many changes levels also functional
responses needed. important finding understanding natural
immunity malaria, essential making efficacious vaccine.
