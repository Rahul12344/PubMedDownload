during infection, increasing pathogen load stimulates protective harmful
aspects host response. dynamics interaction hard to
quantify humans, could improve understanding mechanisms of
disease protection. sought model contributions parasite
multiplication rate host response observed parasite load individual
subjects infected plasmodium falciparum malaria, using data obtained at
the time clinical presentation, identify mechanistic
correlates. predicted higher parasite multiplication rates lower host
responsiveness cases severe malaria, severe anaemia more
insidious cerebral malaria. predicted parasite-growth inhibition was
associated platelet consumption, lower expression cxcl10 type 1
interferon-associated genes, increased cathepsin g matrix
metallopeptidase 9 expression. found cathepsin g matrix
metallopeptidase 9 directly inhibit parasite invasion erythrocytes. the
parasite multiplication rate associated host iron availability and
higher complement factor h levels, lower expression gametocyte-associated
genes higher expression translation-associated genes parasite. 
findings demonstrate potential using explicit modelling pathogen load
dynamics deepen understanding host-pathogen interactions identify
mechanistic correlates protection.
