the crested serpent eagle (spilornis cheela) bird prey found the
tropical rain forest thailand. shikra (accipiter badius) sparrow hawk
and common resident thailand. blood samples 9 crested serpent eagles 
12 shikras obtained september 2010 november 2014. were
clinically healthy negative blood parasites detectable light
microscopy molecular techniques (partial cytochrome b gene avian malaria 
and partial 18s rrna gene trypanosome). cytochemical staining (sudan black b,
peroxidase, α-naphthyl acetate esterase, β-glucuronidase) transmission
electron microscopy performed. hematological results reported the
mean ± standard deviation median. heterophils prevalent
leukocytes crested serpent eagle, shikra, lymphocytes 
most prevalent leukocytes. shikra, vacuoles observed the
cytoplasm eosinophils. blood cells types raptors stained
positively β-glucuronidase negatively peroxidase. ultrastructure 
of heterophils showed clearly differentiate long rod granules crested
serpent eagle spindle-shaped granules shikra. ultrastructure the
eosinophils crested serpent eagle revealed varied electron-dense,
round-shaped granules round, different electron-dense areas centers
of granules, differed structure reported raptors.
these quantitative results may useful clinical evaluations crested
serpent eagles shikras undergoing rehabilitation release.
