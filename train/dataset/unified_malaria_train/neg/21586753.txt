we augmented existing computationally predicted experimentally determined
interactions evolutionarily conserved interactions proteins the
malaria parasite, p. falciparum, human host. validation step, we
found conserved interacting host-parasite protein pairs specifically
expressed host tissues parasite host proteins known 
be active. compared host-parasite interactions experimentally verified
interactions human host proteins different pathogen, hiv-1.
both pathogens found use protein repertoire combinatorial
manner, providing broad connection host cellular processes. specifically,
the two biologically distinct pathogens predominately target central proteins 
take control human host cell, effectively reaching diversified cellular
host cellular functions. interacting signaling pathways small set of
regulatory signaling proteins prime targets pathogens,
suggesting remarkably similar patterns host-pathogen interactions despite 
vast biological differences pathogens. identification shared
molecular strategies virus hiv-1 eukaryotic intracellular pathogen
p. falciparum may allow us illuminate new avenues disease intervention.
