malaria affects millions people worldwide hundreds thousands people 
each year brazil. mosquito anopheles aquasalis important vector of
plasmodium vivax, main human malaria parasite americas. reactive
oxygen species (ros) shown role insect innate immune
responses potent pathogen-killing agent. investigated mechanisms of
free radicals modulation a. aquasalis infection p. vivax. ros
metabolism evaluated vector studying expression activity of
three key detoxification enzymes, one catalase two superoxide dismutases
(sod3a sod3b). also, involvement free radicals mosquito
immunity measured silencing catalase gene followed infection a. 
aquasalis p. vivax. catalase, sod3a sod3b expression whole a.
aquasalis levels controls 24 h upregulated 36 h 
ingestion blood containing p. vivax. however, insect isolated midgut,
the mrna enzymes regulated p. vivax infection, while
catalase activity reduced 24 h infectious meal. rnai-mediated
silencing catalase reduced enzyme activity midgut, resulted in
increased p. vivax infection prevalence, decreased bacterial load 
mosquito midgut. findings suggest interactions a. aquasalis 
and p. vivax follow model ros-induced parasite killing. appears 
that p. vivax manipulates mosquito detoxification system order allow
its development. indirect effect fewer competitive bacteria
present mosquito midgut caused increase ros catalase
silencing. findings provide novel information unique aspects main
malaria parasite americas interaction one natural vectors.
