background: blood parasites studied intensely many families avian
hosts, corvids, particularly cosmopolitan family, remain underexplored.
haemosporidian parasites common raven (corvus corax) been
studied, although largest, adaptable, widespread corvid.
genetic sequence data parasites ravens enhance understanding of
speciation patterns specificity haemosporidian parasites corvids, and
shed light hosts cope parasite pressure.
methods: baited cage trap used catch 86 ravens nested pcr protocol
was used amplify 479Â bp fragment haemosporidian cytochrome b gene
from samples. obtained sequences compared malavi database
of published haemosporidian lineages phylogenetic tree including all
detected raven parasites constructed. examination blood smears was
performed assessment infection intensity.
results: twenty blood parasite lineages recovered ravens caught a
wild population bulgaria. prevalence generalist plasmodium lineages was
49%, prevalence leucocytozoon lineages 31%. 13 detected
leucocytozoon lineages six known different corvids, seven others 
seem specific ravens. phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that
leucocytozoon lineages ravens corvids monophyletic, with
some groups appearing closely related parasites host families.
conclusions: several different, morphologically cryptic groups leucocytozoon
parasites appear infect corvids. ravens harbour generalist corvid
leucocytozoon well apparently species-specific lineages. extraordinary 
breeding ecology scavenging lifestyle possibly allow ravens evade vectors 
and relatively low blood parasite prevalence compared corvids.
