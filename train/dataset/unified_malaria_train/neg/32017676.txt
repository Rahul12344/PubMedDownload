proteins interacting dna fundamental mediating processes as
gene expression, dna replication maintenance genome integrity.
accumulating evidence suggests chromatin apicomplexan parasites, such
as plasmodium falciparum, highly organized, structure provides an
epigenetic mechanism transcriptional regulation. investigate parasite 
chromatin structure regulated, undertook comparative genomics
analysis using 12 distinct eukaryotic genomes. identified conserved and
parasite-specific chromatin-associated domains (cads) proteins (caps). we
then used chromatin enrichment proteomics (chep) approach to
experimentally capture caps p. falciparum. topological scoring analysis of
the proteomics dataset revealed stage-specific enrichments cads caps.
finally, characterized, two candidate caps: conserved homologue the
structural maintenance chromosome 3 protein homologue the
crowded-like nuclei protein, plant-like protein functionally analogous to
animal nuclear lamina proteins. collectively, results provide comprehensive
overview caps apicomplexans, contribute understanding the
complex molecular components regulating chromatin structure genome
architecture deadly parasites.
