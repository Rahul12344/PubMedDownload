synthetic posttranscriptional regulation gene expression important for
understanding fundamental biology programming new cellular processes in
synthetic biology. previous strategies regulating translation eukaryotes
have focused disrupting individual steps translation, including initiation 
and mrna cleavage. emphasizing modularity cross-organism functionality,
these systems designed operate orthogonally native control mechanisms. 
here introduce broadly applicable strategy robustly controlling protein 
translation integrating synthetic translational control via a
small-molecule-regulated rna-protein module native mechanisms that
simultaneously regulate multiple facets cellular rna fate. demonstrate that
this strategy reduces 'leakiness' improve overall expression dynamic range,
and implemented without sacrificing modularity cross-organism
functionality. illustrate saccharomyces cerevisae non-model
human malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum. given limited functional
genetics toolkit available p. falciparum, establish utility this
strategy defining essential genes.
