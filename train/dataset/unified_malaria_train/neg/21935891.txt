malaria caused unicellular apicomplexan parasites genus
plasmodium, which, including major human parasite plasmodium
falciparum, extreme genome compositions (a/t content > 80%). this
overview rna production, roles degradation, show despite their
unusual genome composition parasites generally exhibit standard
eukaryotic features processes. thus genes monocistronic and
transcribed rna polymerases conform general categories i, ii,
and iii. plasmodium spp. unusual possess structurally distinct
rrna genes expressed different points complicated life cycle
of parasite. transcription blood stage asexual parasites follows cascade
consistent dependency upon plant-like apetala 2 (ap2) dna-binding
proteins. mrna transported to, translated degraded cytoplasm and
the transcription pattern largely inflexible responsive temperature and
glucose drugs. furthermore, although plasmodium spp. undertake controlled
repression mrna species number points life cycle one
mechanism, employed female gametocytes (gamete precursor cells), clear; 
resembles metazoan female gametes, consisting complex of
repression-associated proteins architecture formed mrna 5' cap and
dependent u-rich untranslated region (utr) elements. extensive antisense
transcription documented resulting production short and
long transcripts generally unknown functional significance. review
attempts summarize currently known biology plasmodium
