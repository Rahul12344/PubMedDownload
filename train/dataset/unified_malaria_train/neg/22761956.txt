cd8(+) cell responses vaccinia virus directed almost exclusively against
early gene products. attenuated strain modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva)
is evaluation clinical trials new vaccines designed elicit
cellular immune responses pathogens including plasmodium spp., m.
tuberculosis hiv-1. recombinant mvas (rmva) utilize the
well-established method linking gene interest cloned poxviral
promoter prior insertion viral genome suitable locus by
homologous recombination infected cells. using bac recombineering, show
that potent early promoters drive expression non-functional or
non-essential mva open reading frames (orfs) harnessed immunogenic
expression recombinant antigen. precise replacement mva orthologs of
c11r, f11l, a44l b8r model antigen positioned use same
translation initiation codon allowed early transgene expression similar or
slightly greater achieved commonly-used p7.5 short synthetic 
promoters. frequency antigen-specific cd8(+) cells induced mice by
single shot adenovirus-prime, rmva-boost vaccination similarly equal or
marginally enhanced using endogenous promoters authentic genomic loci
compared traditional constructs. enhancement immunogenicity
observed using c11r f11l promoters compared p7.5 similar 
obtained mh5 promoter compared p7.5. furthermore, growth rates 
of viruses unimpaired insertions genetically stable.
insertion transgenic orf place viral orf bac recombineering can
thus provide potent promoter, also, concomitantly, suitable
insertion site, potentially facilitating development mva vaccines expressing
multiple recombinant antigens.
