artocarpus altilis (parkinson) fosberg traditionally used indonesia
for treatment liver cirrhosis, hypertension, diabetes. many other
countries, used treatment malaria, yellow fever, dengue
fever. reported a. altilis extracts antiatherosclerotic and
cytoprotective effects, molecular targets tumor cells yet
fully understood. a. altilis extracts partially purified fraction
have shown inhibit stat3 activity phosphorylation stat3 a
dose-dependent manner. identify active components, bioassay-guided
isolation partially purified fraction resulted identification 
geranyl dihydrochalcone, cg901. chemical structure established the
basis spectroscopic evidence comparison published data. partially
purified fraction isolated geranyl dihydrochalcone, cg901,
down-regulated expression stat3 target genes, induced apoptosis du145
prostate cancer cells via caspase-3 parp degradation, inhibited tumor
growth human prostate tumor (du145) xenograft initiation model. results 
suggest a. altilis could good natural source isolated
compound potential lead molecule developing novel therapeutics
against stat3-related diseases, including cancer inflammation.
