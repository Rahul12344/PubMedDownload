malaria widespread infectious disease leading cause death
in many parts world. eradication malaria major world health 
goal decades, one still remains elusive. diseases been
eradicated using vaccination, traditional vaccination methods thus far
been unsuccessful malaria. infection plasmodium species, causative
agent malaria, currently treated drug-based therapies, increase
in drug resistance led need new methods treatment. promising 
strategy malaria treatment combine transmission blocking vaccines
(tbvs) prevent spread disease drug-based therapies treat infected
individuals. tbvs developed surface protein antigens are
expressed parasite reproduction mosquito. mosquito ingests
blood vaccinated individual harboring plasmodium parasite, the
antibodies generated vaccination prevent completion parasites
life-cycle. animal studies shown immunization pfs48/45 results 
the production malaria transmission blocking antibodies; however, the
development vaccine candidate hindered poor expression in
both prokaryotic eukaryotic hosts. recently, chloroplast chlamydomonas
reinhardtii used express complex recombinant proteins. study,
we show c-terminal antigenic region pfs48/45 antigen be
expressed chloroplast green algae c. reinhardtii this
recombinant protein conformation recognized known transmission blocking 
antibodies. production protein algae potential scale the
very large volumes required meet needs millions risk contracting
malaria.
