saliva urine malaria-infected individuals contain trace amounts of
plasmodium dna, therefore, could used alternative specimens for
diagnosis. nested pcr targeting mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb-pcr) 
of four human malaria species plasmodium knowlesi developed tested
with 693 blood samples febrile patients living diverse malaria-endemic
areas thailand, compared microscopy nested pcr targeting
small-subunit rrna (18s-pcr). cytb-pcr 16% 39.8% sensitive than
18s-pcr microscopy, respectively, detecting malarial species 
in blood samples. importantly, 34% 17% plasmodium falciparum and
plasmodium vivax mono-infections, respectively, detected microscopy were, in
fact, mixed p. falciparum p. non-falciparum infections. analysis matched
blood, saliva urine 157 individuals showed microscopy cytb-pcr 
of saliva yielded significant difference detecting p. falciparum p.
vivax. however, cytb-pcr saliva sensitive microscopy for
diagnosis mixed-species infections. combination cytb-pcr saliva of
urine significantly outperformed microscopy (p 0.0098 p. falciparum, p 0.006 
for p. vivax, p 0.0002 mixed infections). furthermore, plasmodium
malariae p. knowlesi could also identified saliva urine this
method. therefore, cytb-pcr developed herein offers high potential 
use saliva urine malaria diagnosis, sensitivity comparable
with superior microscopy.
