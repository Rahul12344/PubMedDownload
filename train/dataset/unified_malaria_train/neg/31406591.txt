surveillance diagnosis plasmodium falciparum malaria relies predominantly 
on rapid diagnostic tests (rdt). however, false-negative (fn) rdt results are
known occur variety reasons, including operator error, poor storage
conditions, pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, poor performance specific rdt brands 
lots, low-parasite density infections. used rdt microscopy results
from 85 000 children enrolled demographic health surveys malaria indicator
surveys 2009 2015 across 19 countries explore distribution 
risk factors fn-rdts sub-saharan africa, malaria's impact is
greatest. sought (1) identify spatial demographic patterns fn-rdt
results, defined negative rdt positive gold standard microscopy test,
and (2) estimate percentage infections missed within community-based
malaria surveys due fn-rdt results. across studies, 19.9% (95% ci 19.0% to
20.9%) microscopy-positive subjects negative rdt. distribution 
fn-rdt results spatially heterogeneous. variance fn-rdt results was
best explained prevalence malaria, increase fn-rdt results
observed lower transmission intensities, among younger subjects, urban 
areas. observed proportion fn-rdt results predicted differences
in rdt brand lot performance alone. findings characterise the
probability detection rdts varies different transmission settings and
emphasise need careful interpretation prevalence estimates based on
surveys employing rdts alone. studies needed characterise the
cost-effectiveness improved malaria diagnostics (eg, pcr highly sensitive
rdts) community-based surveys, especially regions low transmission
intensity high urbanicity.
