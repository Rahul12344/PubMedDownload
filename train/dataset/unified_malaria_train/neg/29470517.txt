apicomplexan parasites global killers, causative agents diseases
like toxoplasmosis malaria. parasites known hypersensitive to
redox imbalance, yet little understood cellular roles their
various redox regulators. apicoplast, essential plastid organelle, a
verified apicomplexan drug target. nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins traffic
through er multiple apicoplast sub-compartments place of
function. propose thioredoxins contribute control protein
trafficking protein function within apicoplast compartments. we
studied role two toxoplasma gondii apicoplast thioredoxins (tgatrx), 
essential parasite survival. describing cellular phenotypes the
conditional depletion either redox regulated enzymes show that
each contributes different apicoplast biogenesis pathway. provide
evidence tgatrx1's involvement er apicoplast trafficking tgatrx2 in
the control apicoplast gene expression components. substrate pull-down further
recognizes gene expression factors interact tgatrx2. use genetic
complementation demonstrate function tgatrxs dependent 
their disulphide exchange activity. finally, tgatrx2 divergent human
thioredoxins. demonstrate activity vitro thus providing scope drug 
screening. study represents first functional characterization of
thioredoxins toxoplasma, highlights importance redox regulation of
apicoplast functions provides new tools study redox biology these
parasites.
