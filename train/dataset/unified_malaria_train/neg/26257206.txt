pancreatic cancer currently fourth common cancer, increasing in
incidence soon second leading cause cancer death usa.
this deadly malignancy incidence approximates mortality
with 44,000 new cases 36,000 deaths year. surgery, although only
modestly successful, curative option. however, due locally
aggressive nature early metastasis, surgery performed less 20%
of patients. cytotoxic chemotherapy palliative, significant toxicity and
improves survival little. thus new treatment paradigms needed
desperately. due extremely high frequency kras gene mutations (>90%)
detected pancreatic cancer patients, roles epidermal growth factor 
receptor (egfr), ras/raf/mek/erk pi3k/pten/akt/mtorc1/gsk-3 pathways have
been investigated pancreatic cancer many years. constitutively active ras 
can activate pathways cross talk ras egfr 
which believed important driving metastasis. mutant kras may also
drive expression gsk-3 raf/mek/erk-mediated effects gsk-3
transcription. gsk-3 regulate expression nf-kappab is
important modulating pancreatic cancer chemoresistance. receptors
and many downstream signaling molecules identified characterized,
there still much learn pathways deregulation 
lead cancer. multiple inhibitors egfr, pi3k, mtor, gsk-3, raf, mek and
hedgehog (hh) developed evaluated various cancers.
current research often focuses role pathways cancer stem cells
(csc), goal identify sites therapeutic resistance may develop. 
relatively novel fields investigation micrornas drugs used for
other diseases e.g., diabetes, (metformin) malaria (chloroquine) have
provided new information therapeutic resistance cscs. review
