in landmark 1987 study merozoite surface protein-1 locus plasmodium
falciparum, kazuyuki tanabe coauthors introduced phenomenon allelic
dimorphism, antigenic diversity arranged two maximally diverged 
haplotypes. work extended finding loci p.
falciparum. loci allelic dimorphism observed encodes
major surface antigens blood-stage malaria parasites, consequently a
major vaccine target, thus understanding origins implications allelic 
dimorphism crucial importance. examine essential features of
allelic dimorphism dimorphic malarial surface antigens. sequence
analysis, conclude ancestral population may been
recombining/multimorphic rather dimorphic. hypothesize pathway to
allelic dimorphism ancestral allele-rich recombining population could
have undergone severe population bottleneck, putatively caused lateral
transfer p. falciparum apes humans. bottleneck produced a
reduction allelic diversity, favoring survival divergent
alleles, turn led recombination suppression strong natural
selection recombinants.
