cgmp-dependent protein kinase plasmodium falciparum ( pfpkg) plays crucial
role sexual well asexual proliferation human malaria
causing parasite. however, function regulation pfpkg largely unknown. 
previous studies showed domain organization pfpkg significantly
differs human pkg ( hpkg) indicated critical role cyclic
nucleotide binding domain (cnb-d). identified novel mechanism, the
cnb-d controls activation regulation parasite specific protein kinase.
here, kinase activity dependent pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory
sequence (is), reported human pkg. construct lacking putative and
containing cnb-d catalytic domain inactive absence 
cgmp efficiently activated cgmp. basis structural
evidence, describe regulatory mechanism, whereby cgmp binding cnb-d
induces conformational change involving αc-helix cnb-d. inactive
state defined unique interaction asp597 catalytic domain
and arg528 αc-helix. arginine (r528), however, stabilizes cgmp
binding interacting tyr480 phosphate binding cassette (pbc). 
represents active state pfpkg. results unveil fundamental differences 
in activation mechanism pfpkg hpkg, building basis the
development strategies targeted drug design fighting malaria.
