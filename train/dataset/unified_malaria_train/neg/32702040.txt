histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2) detecting rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) have
played important role enabling prompt malaria diagnosis remote
locations. however, emergence pfhrp2 deleted parasites threatening the
efficacy rdts, world health organization (who) highlighted
surveillance deletions priority. nested pcr used confirm
pfhrp2 deletion costly laborious. due spurious amplification of
paralogue pfhrp3, identity nested exon 1 pcr product must confirmed 
sequencing. describe new one-step pcr method detection pfhrp2.
to determine sensitivity specificity, pcrs performed triplicate. 
using photo-induced electron transfer (pet) pcr detecting 18srrna true
positive, one-step comparable sensitivity 95.0% (88.7-98.4%) nested
exon 1, 99.0% (94.6-99.9%) nested exon 2, 98.0% (93.0-99.8%), comparable 
specificity 93.8% (69.8-99.8%) nested exon 1 100.0% (79.4-100.0%) nested
exon 2, 100.0% (74.4-100.0%). sequencing revealed one step pcr not
amplify pfhrp3. logistic regression models applied measure 95% level of
detection one-step pcr clinical isolates provided estimates 133p/μl 
(95% confidence interval (ci): 3-793p/μl) whole blood (wb) samples and
385p/μl (95% ci: 31-2133 p/μl) dried blood spots (dbss). considering
protocol attributes, one-step pcr less expensive, faster suitable
for high throughput. summary, developed accurate pcr method
that may ideal application protocol investigating
pfhrp2 deletions symptomatic individuals presenting health care facilities.
