background: copy number major source genome variation important
evolutionary implications. consequently, essential determine copy number
variant (cnv) behavior, distributions frequencies across genomes to
understand origins evolutionary generational time frames. we
use comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) microarray resolution
provided segregating population cloned progeny lines malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, identify analyze inheritance 170
genome-wide cnvs.
results: describe cnvs progeny clones derived mendelian (i.e.
inherited) non-mendelian mechanisms. forty-five cnvs present the
parent lines segregated progeny population. furthermore, extensive
variation conform strict mendelian inheritance patterns was
observed. 124 cnvs called one progeny neither parent: we
observed cnvs one progeny clone identified either
parent, located frequently telomeric-subtelomeric regions of
chromosomes singleton de novo cnvs distributed evenly throughout genome. 
linkage analysis cnvs revealed dynamic copy number fluctuations suggested 
mechanisms could generated them. five 12 previously identified
expression quantitative trait loci (eqtl) hotspots coincide cnvs,
demonstrating potential broad influence cnv transcriptional
program phenotypic variation.
conclusions: cnvs significant source segregating de novo genome
variation involving hundreds genes. examination progeny genome segments
provides framework assess extent possible origins cnvs. this
segregating genetic system reveals breadth, distribution dynamics cnvs
in surprisingly plastic parasite genome, providing new perspective the
sources diversity parasite populations.
