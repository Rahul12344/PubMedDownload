the atp-dependent clpqy system prokaryotic proteasome-like multi-subunit
machinery localized mitochondrion malaria parasite. clpqy machinery
consists clpq threonine protease clpy atpase. present study, we
have assessed cellular effects transient interference pfclpq protease
activity plasmodium falciparum using trans-dominant negative approach
combined fkbp degradation domain system. proteolytically inactive mutant
pfclpq protein [pfclpq(mut)] fused fkbp degradation domain expressed 
parasites, gets stabilized shield1 drug treatment. show the
inactive pfclpq(mut) interacts wild-type pfclpq associates within
multi-subunit complex parasite. stabilization pfclpq(mut) its
association protease machinery caused dominant negative effect the
transgenic parasites, disrupted growth cycle asexual blood stage
parasites. mitochondria parasites showed abnormal morphology, 
mitochondria able grow divide parasite. show
that dominant negative effect pfclpq(mut) disrupted transcription of
mitochondrial genome encoded genes, turn blocked normal development 
functioning mitochondria.
