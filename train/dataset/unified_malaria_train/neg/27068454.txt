background: plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (csp) major surface antigen 
present sporozoite (spz) stage malaria parasite. rts, vaccine, 
most clinically advanced malaria vaccine, consists large portion of
plasmodium falciparum csp (pfcsp). highly infectious, recombinant rodent
malaria, plasmodium yoelii parasite bearing full-length pfcsp, pfcsp/py spz,
was needed tool evaluate role pfcsp mediating, protective,
anti-malaria immunity mouse model.
methods: transgenic parasite, pfcsp/py spz, generated inserting a
construct expressing pfcsp locus p. yoelii csp gene double
cross-over homologous recombination. biological protective
properties pfcsp/py spz determined.
results: pfcsp/py parasite produced 30,000 spz mosquito salivary
glands, equal even higher number spz produced by
wild-type p. yoelii parasites. five bites pfcsp/py-infected mosquitoes could
induce blood infection balb/c mice.
conclusions: current study demonstrated successful establishment a
transgenic p. yoelii parasite clone able express full-length pfcsp, 
pfcsp/py parasite. importantly, pfcsp/py parasite infectious as
the wild-type p. yoelii parasite mosquito vector mouse, a
mammalian host. new transgenic parasite expresses full-length pfcsp may 
become useful tool researchers investigate immunity pfcsp a
mouse model.
