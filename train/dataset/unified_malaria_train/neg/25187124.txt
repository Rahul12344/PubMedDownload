background: major histocompatibility complex (mhc) polymorphic
genetic region vertebrates, origin genetic diversity remains
unresolved. several studies demonstrated within-population level that
individuals harbouring particular alleles less susceptible to
malaria, allow strong generalization.
methods: worldwide data frequencies several hundred mhc alleles of
the human leucocyte antigen (hla) system relation malaria risk the
between-population level analysed phylogenetic framework, results
for different alleles quantitatively summarized meta-analysis.
results: overall positive relationship malaria pressure 
the frequency several hla alleles indicating allele frequencies increase 
in countries strong malaria pressure. nevertheless, considerable
heterogeneity observed across alleles, alleles showed remarkable
negative relationship malaria risk. heterogeneities partitioned
into different organization groups mhc, strongest positive
relationships detected alleles hla-a hla-b loci, there
were also differences mhc supertypes constitute functionally
distinct nucleotide sequences. finally, number mhc alleles are
maintained within countries also related malaria risk.
conclusion: therefore, malaria represents key selection pressure human 
mhc left clear evolutionary footprints frequencies the
number alleles observed different countries.
