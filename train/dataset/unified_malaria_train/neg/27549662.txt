background: malaria exerts tremendous socioeconomic impact worldwide despite
current control efforts, novel disease transmission-blocking strategies are
urgently needed. enterobacter bacterium esp_z, naturally harboured
in mosquito midgut, inhibit development plasmodium parasites prior
to invasion midgut epithelium mechanism involves
oxidative stress. here, multifaceted approach used study tripartite
interactions mosquito, esp_z plasmodium, towards addressing the
feasibility using sugar-baited exposure mosquitoes esp_z bacterium
for interruption malaria transmission.
methods: ability esp_z colonize anopheles gambiae midguts harbouring
microbiota derived wild mosquitoes determined qpcr. upon introduction
of esp_z via nectar feeding, permissiveness colonized mosquitoes to
plasmodium falciparum infection determined, well impact esp_z on
mosquito fitness parameters, longevity, number eggs laid number of
larvae hatched. genome esp_z sequenced, transcriptome analyses
were performed identify bacterial genes important colonization of
the mosquito midgut, well ros-production. gene expression analysis of
members oxidative defence pathway plasmodium berghei also conducted
to assess parasite's oxidative defence response esp_z exposure.
results: esp_z persisted 4Â days an. gambiae midgut after
introduction via nectar feeding, able significantly inhibit plasmodium
sporogonic development. introduction bacterium adversely affect
mosquito fitness. candidate genes involved selection better fit esp_z
to mosquito midgut environment ability condition oxidative
status surroundings identified, parasite expression data
indicated esp_z able induce partial temporary shutdown the
ookinetes antioxidant response.
conclusions: esp_z capable inhibiting sporogonic development plasmodium 
in presence mosquito's native microbiota without affecting mosquito
fitness. several candidate bacterial genes likely mediating midgut
colonization ros production, inhibition plasmodium development appears
to involve shutdown parasite's oxidative defence system. better
understanding complex reciprocal tripartite interactions facilitate
the development optimization esp_z-based malaria control strategy.
