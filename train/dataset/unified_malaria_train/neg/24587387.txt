sporozoites plasmodium falciparum transmitted human hosts anopheles 
mosquitoes. thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (trap) expressed in
sporozoites plays crucial role sporozoite gliding invasion human 
hepatocytes. previous study showed trap gene subjected to
balancing selection gambian p. falciparum population. study the
molecular evolution trap gene plasmodium falciparum, investigated
trap polymorphisms p. falciparum isolates suan phueng district in
ratchaburi province, thailand. analysis entire trap coding sequences
in 32 isolates identified total 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps),
which comprised 37 nonsynonymous two synonymous snps. mcdonald-kreitman test 
showed ratio number nonsynonymous synonymous polymorphic
sites within p. falciparum significantly higher number of
nonsynonymous synonymous fixed sites p. falciparum p. reichenowi. 
furthermore, rate nonsynonymous substitution significantly higher than
that synonymous substitution within thai p. falciparum. results indicate
that trap gene subject diversifying selection thai p.
falciparum population well gambian p. falciparum population. comparison
of p. falciparum isolates another region thailand (tak
province, thailand) revealed trap highly differentiated between
geographically close regions. rapid diversification seems reflect strong 
recent positive selection trap. results suggest trap molecule 
a major target human immune response pre-erythrocytic stages p.
falciparum.
