background: reservoir plasmodium infection humans traditionally
been defined blood slide positivity. study designed characterize
the local reservoir infection relation diverse var genes encode
the major surface antigen plasmodium falciparum blood stages underlie 
parasite's ability establish chronic infection transmit human to
mosquito.
methodology/principal findings: investigated molecular epidemiology the
var multigene family local sites gabon, senegal kenya differ in
parasite prevalence transmission intensity. 1839 distinct var gene types were
defined sequencing dblÎ± domains three sites. 76 (4.1%) var types
were found one population indicating spatial heterogeneity var
types across african continent. majority var types appeared 
in population sample. non-parametric statistical estimators predict each
population minimum five seven thousand distinct var types. similar
diversity var types seen sites different parasite prevalences.
conclusions/significance: var population genomics provides new insights 
epidemiology p. falciparum africa malaria never conquered.
in particular, described extensive reservoir infection local
african sites discovered unique var population structure can
facilitate superinfection minimal overlap var repertoires among
parasite genomes. findings show var typing molecular surveillance
system defines extent genetic complexity reservoir infection 
complement measures malaria prevalence. observed small scale spatial
diversity var genes suggests var genetics could greatly inform current
malaria mapping approaches predict complex malaria population dynamics due to
the import var types areas widespread pre-existing immunity the
population exists.
