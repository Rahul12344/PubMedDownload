malaria parasites complex life cycle multiple developmental stages in
mosquito vertebrate hosts, different developmental stages express unique 
sets genes. unexpectedly, many transcription factors (tfs) commonly found in
eukaryotic organisms absent malaria parasites; instead, family genes 
encoding proteins similar plant apetala2 (apiap2) transcription factors is
expanded parasites. several malaria apiap2 genes shown play a
critical role parasite development; however, functions majority 
the apiap2 genes remain elucidated. particular, study the
plasmodium yoelii apiap2 (pyapiap2) gene family reported far. this
study systematically investigated functional roles pyapiap2 genes in
parasite development. twenty-four 26 pyapiap2 genes selected for
disruption, 12 successfully knocked using clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat-crispr-associated protein 9 (crispr-cas9)
method. effects gene knockout (ko) parasite development mouse and
mosquito stages evaluated. ten 12 successfully disrupted genes, including
two genes functionally characterized plasmodium species
previously, shown critical p. yoelii development sexual and
mosquito stages. additionally, seven genes labeled protein
expression analysis, revealing important information supporting functions. 
this study represents first systematic functional characterization the
p. yoelii apiap2 gene family discovers important insights roles the
apiap2 genes parasite development.importance malaria parasitic disease
that infects hundreds millions people, leading estimated 0.35 million
deaths 2015. better understanding mechanism gene expression
regulation parasite development may provide important clues disease
control prevention. study, systematic gene disruption experiments
were performed study functional roles members plasmodium yoelii 
apiap2 (pyapiap2) gene family parasite development. genes critical
for development male female gametocytes, oocysts, sporozoites were
characterized. protein expression profiles seven pyapiap2 gene
products also analyzed, revealing important information functions. 
this study provides expression functional information many pyapiap2
genes, explored disease management.
