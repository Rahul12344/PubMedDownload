background: acute febrile illnesses (afi) usually associated 
specific diagnosis limitations available diagnostics. study
reports frequency ebv viremia viral load children adults
presenting febrile illness hospitals kenya.
methodology/principal findings: pathogen surveillance study conducted on
patients presenting afi (n = 796) outpatient departments 8 hospitals
located diverse regions kenya. enrollment criterion study fever 
without readily diagnosable infection. patients afi not
attributable common causes fever kenyan hospitals, malaria
or rickettsiae, leptospira, brucella salmonella hence
categorized afi unknown etiology. ebv detected blood using
quantitative taqman-based qpcr targeting highly conserved balf5 gene. the
overall frequency ebv viremia population 29.2%, significantly
higher proportion younger children <5years (33.8%, p = 0.039) compared to
patients aged â‰¥5 years (26.3% 5-15 years 18.8% >15 years). with
respect geographical localities, frequency ebv viremia higher in
the lake victoria region (36.4%), compared kisii highland (24.6%), coastal
region (22.2%) semi-arid region (25%). furthermore, patients malaria
endemic coastal region lake victoria region presented significantly 
higher viremia individuals regions kenya.
conclusions/significance: study provides profiles ebv patients with
afi diverse eco-regions kenya. significant interest high
frequency ebv viremia younger children. observed high frequencies of
ebv viremia elevated viral loads residents high malaria transmission
areas probably related malaria induced immune activation resultant
expansion ebv infected b-cells.
