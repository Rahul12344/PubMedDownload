background: antimalarial drug resistance major contributor the
failure battle malaria many developing countries. p.
falciparum genes, pfcrt pfmdr-1, implicated chloroquine
resistance. objective study determine presence mutant
alleles chloroquine resistance genes among isolates p. falciparum
from children presenting severe malaria ghana.
methods: venous blood samples taken patients, plasma chloroquine
levels measured. p. falciparum chromosomal dna isolated blood
samples, subjected pcr, restriction digestion sequencing. resulting
data analysed using stata statistical software.
results: 140 children recruited study, 109 (77.9%) detectable
pre-treatment chloroquine levels. pcr restriction digestion analysis the
pfcrt gene indicated 124 (88.6%) mutant t76 gene, this
correlated higher chloroquine levels. sequence analysis showed
consistent genetic sequences chloroquine resistant sensitive parasites
with respect pfcrt codons 72 76.the pfcrt t76 mutation found in
88.4% isolates pfmdr-1y86 mutation. pfmdr-1 y86 mutation was
found 67.6% isolates pfcrt t76 mutation.
conclusion: study affirms pfcrt better chloroquine resistance marker.
both mutations independently selected chloroquine levels one
mutation (y86) might modify/increase effect (t76). study
also depicts much-overlooked antimalarial drug resistance situation the
area emphasizes need proper treatment strategy.
