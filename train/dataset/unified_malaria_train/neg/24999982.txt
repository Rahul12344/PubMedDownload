cattle main reservoir host c. andersoni, shows predominance in
yearlings adults cattle. understand subtypes c. andersoni and
the population genetic structure heilongjiang province, fecal specimens were
collected 420 dairy cattle 405 beef cattle age 12-14 months in
eight cattle farms five areas within province screened the
presence cryptosporidium oocysts microscopy sheather's sugar
flotation technique. average prevalence cryptosporidium spp. 19.15%
(158/825) cryptosporidium isolates identified c. andersoni by
the ssu rrna gene nested pcr-rflp using sspi, vspi mboii restriction enzymes.
a total 50 c. andersoni isolates randomly selected sequenced to
confirm rflp results subtyped multilocus sequence typing 
(mlst) four microsatellite/minisatellite loci (ms1, ms2, ms3 ms16).
four, one, two one haplotypes obtained four loci, respectively.
the mlst subtype a4,a4,a4,a1 showed absolute predominance wide
distribution among six mlst subtypes obtained investigated areas.
linkage disequilibrium analysis showed presence clonal population
genetic structure c. andersoni cattle, suggesting absence of
recombination among lineages. finding clonal population genetic
structure indicated prevalence c. andersoni cattle heilongjiang
province attributed introduction cattle. thus, prevention and
control strategies focused making stricter measures avoid the
occurrence cross-transmission re-infection cattle individuals.
these molecular data also helpful explore source attribution of
infection/contamination c. andersoni elucidate transmission
dynamics heilongjiang province, even china.
