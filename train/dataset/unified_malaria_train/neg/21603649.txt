plasmodium vivax considered rare predominantly duffy negative
populations sub-saharan africa, red blood cell surface antigen is
essential invasion parasite. however, despite reports of
molecularly confirmed p. vivax tropical africa, serological evidence
indicated 13% persons sampled congo exposed p. vivax. 
we identified p. vivax microscopy 8 smears ugandan pregnant women 
had enrolled longitudinal study malaria pregnancy. nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocol used detect identify the
plasmodium parasites present. pcr analysis confirmed presence p. vivax for
three women analysis available samples women
revealed clinically silent chronic low-grade vivax infections two them.
the parasites one woman carried pyrimethamine resistance-associated double
non-synonymous mutations p. vivax dihydrofolate reductase gene. three 
women found infected p. vivax duffy positive nine 68 women
randomly selected cohort. data presented three case
reports consistent stable transmission malaria predominantly
duffy negative african population. given substantial morbidity associated
with vivax infection non-african endemic areas, important to
investigate whether distribution prevalence p. vivax been
underestimated sub-saharan africa. particularly important the
context drive eliminate malaria morbidity.
