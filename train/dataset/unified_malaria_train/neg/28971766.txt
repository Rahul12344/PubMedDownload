ornithine decarboxylase first enzyme polyamine biosynthetic
pathway. rate-limiting enzyme included change of
ornithine putrescine first polyamine. polyamines (putrescine,
spermidine, spermine) natural synthetic compounds contain two or
more amino group. polyamines highly implicated cellular functions 
cell growth & multiplication, dna stabilization, gene transcription and
translation, ion-channel activity, etc. elevated levels polyamines found
in highly proliferating tumor cells. hence inhibition enzyme found
useful cancer. α-dl-difluoromethylornithine(dfmo) (eflornithine) enzyme-
activated irreversible inhibitor first type. however, use 
an anticancer agent continue long due various reasons. polyamines 
have also found play important role infectious
microorganisms. eflornithine successfully used diseases african
sleeping sickness researched number tropical diseases. 
it widely used hirsutism women. various product (putrescine) 
based analogs transition state plp (cofactor) based analogs being
synthesized diseases leishmaniasis, malaria others discussed 
in article.
