neutrophils (pmns) abundant cellular component innate immune 
system, play central roles pathogenesis resistance 
broad range diseases. however, roles malarial infection remain poorly
understood. therefore, examined transcriptional gene profile human pmns
in response plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (irbcs) using
oligonucleotide microarrays. results revealed pmns induced broad and
vigorous set changes gene expression response malarial parasites,
represented 118 upregulated 216 downregulated genes. transcriptional
response characterized upregulation numerous genes encoding
multiple surface receptors, proteins involved signal transduction pathways,
and defense response proteins. response included number genes are
known involved pathogenesis malaria inflammatory
diseases. gene enrichment analysis suggested biological pathways
involved pmn responses irbcs included insulin receptor, jak-stat
signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk), interleukin and
interferon-gamma (ifn-Î³) signaling pathways. current study provides
fundamental knowledge molecular responses neutrophils malarial
parasites, may aid discovery novel therapeutic interventions.
