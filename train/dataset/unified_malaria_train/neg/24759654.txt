plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) important
virulence factor encoded family 59 var genes, including 56 var genes plus
3 small var3 genes. var genes among diverse sequences p. 
falciparum genome, var3 genes found conserved p. falciparum
strains. previous studies mainly focused typical var genes,
while biological characteristics var3 genes remain unknown. this
study, three var3 genes, pf3d7_0100300, pf3d7_0600400, pf3d7_0937600,
were found transcribed erythrocytic stages p. falciparum, 
peak transcription level 16 h post-invasion, terminated immediately
after 16 h post-invasion. encoded protein pf3d7_0600400 could detected 
in late trophozoite stage schizont stage, encoded proteins
of pf3d7_0100300 pf3d7_0937600 could detected late trophozoite
stage schizont stage, respectively. thus, var3 genes p. falciparum
3d7 strain differentially expressed erythrocytic development of
the parasite.
