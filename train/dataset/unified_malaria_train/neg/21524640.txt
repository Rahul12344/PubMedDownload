plasmodium vivax still prevalent human plasmodium outside africa 
despite fact, still deep lack knowledge biology.
metacaspases cysteine proteases related metazoan caspases, involved in
programmed cell death. here, characterized p. vivax metacaspase 1
gene total 63 vivax isolates, 32 isolates collected southern iran 
31 italian imported isolates originating 12 different endemic countries. 
have firstly identified dna size polymorphism p. vivax metacaspase 1 gene. a
total four different allelic sizes found, resulting insertion of
1 4 tandem repeat units located within intronic region p. vivax
metacaspase 1. similarly, also identified four distinct allelic types 
using vivax merozoite surface protein-1 size polymorphism analysis.
