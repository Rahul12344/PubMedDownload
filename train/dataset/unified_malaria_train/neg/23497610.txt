background: dicistroviridae new family small, non-enveloped, +ssrna
viruses pathogenic beneficial arthropods insect pests. little is
known dicistrovirus replication mechanism gene function, any
knowledge subjects comes mainly comparisons mammalian viruses 
from picornaviridae family. due peculiar genome organization and
characteristics per os viral transmission route, dicistroviruses make good
candidates use biopesticides. triatoma virus (trv) pathogen of
triatoma infestans (hemiptera: reduviidae), one main vectors human 
trypanosomiasis disease called chagas disease. trv postulated potential 
control agent chagas' vectors. although evidence trv nor
other dicistroviruses replicate species outside insecta class, the
innocuousness viruses humans animals needs ascertained.
methods: study, rt-pcr elisa used detect infectivity of
this virus mus musculus balb/c mice.
results: study observed significant difference
in ratio igg2a/igg1 sera animals inoculated trv compared
with non-inoculated animals mice inoculated non-infective trv
protein capsids.
conclusions: conclude that, experimental conditions, trv unable
to replicate mice. study constitutes first test evaluate the
infectivity dicistrovirus vertebrate animal model.
