t-cell receptor transgenic mice powerful tools study cell responses to
malaria parasites. allow population antigen specific cells 
monitored developing responses immunization parasite infection; this
makes particularly useful study fundamental aspects cell activation,
differentiation, migration different tissue compartments. moreover, the
use cells allows thorough analysis mechanisms of
antiparasite activity cells.
