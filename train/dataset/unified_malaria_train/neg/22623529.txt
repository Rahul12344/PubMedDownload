plasmodium falciparum lines differ ability infect mosquitoes. the
anopheles gambiae l3-5 refractory (r) line melanizes plasmodium species,
including brazilian p. falciparum 7g8 line, highly susceptible to
some african p. falciparum strains 3d7, nf54, gb4. investigated
whether lines differ ability evade mosquito immune system. 
silencing key components mosquito complement-like system
[thioester-containing protein 1 (tep1), leucine-rich repeat protein 1, and
anopheles plasmodium-responsive leucine-rich repeat protein 1] prevented
melanization 7g8 parasites, reverting refractory phenotype. contrast,
it effect intensity infection nf54, suggesting this
line able evade tep1-mediated lysis. r females coinfected 
line melanized (7g8) line survives (3d7), coinfection
resulted mixed infections live encapsulated parasites on
individual midguts. finding shows survival individual parasites is
parasite-specific systemic nature, parasites evade
tep1-mediated lysis even parasites melanized midgut.
when females extensive genetic cross r susceptible a. gambiae
(g3) mosquitoes infected p. berghei, encapsulation strongly
correlated tep1-r1 allele. however, p. falciparum 7g8 parasites 
longer encapsulated females cross, indicating tep1-r1
allele sufficient melanize line. evasion a. gambiae immune 
system p. falciparum may result parasite adaptation sympatric
mosquito vectors may important factor driving malaria transmission.
