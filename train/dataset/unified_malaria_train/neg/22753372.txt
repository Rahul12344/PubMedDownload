recent studies suggest shared pathogenic pathways malaria allergy.

relationship basophil activation remains unknown. recruited p.
falciparum-infected patients senegal mild malaria (mm; n = 19) severe 
malaria (sm; n = 9) symptoms healthy controls (hc; n = 38). levels serum
ige, pftctp, igg antibodies pftctp determined enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (elisa). basophil reactivities ige-dependent and
-independent stimulations measured ex vivo using fresh blood looking at
the expression level basophil activation marker cd203c flow

cd203c expression compared hc sm. normalization this
baseline level, basophils sm showed enhanced reactivity calcimycin

after anti-ige stimulation, great interindividual differences allow the
results reach statistical significance. primed recombinant tctp
