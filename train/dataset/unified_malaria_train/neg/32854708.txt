background: malaria antigen-specific antibodies polymorphisms host
receptors involved antibody functionality associated different 
outcomes plasmodium falciparum infections. thus, identify key prospective
malaria antigens vaccine development, need evaluate the
associations malaria antibodies antibody dependent host factors 
more rigorous statistical methods. study, different statistical models
were used evaluate predictive performance malaria-specific antibodies
and host gene polymorphisms p. falciparum infection longitudinal cohort
study involving ghanaian children.
methods: models different functional forms built using known predictors
(age, sickle cell status, blood group status, parasite density, mosquito bed 
net use) malaria antigen-specific immunoglobulin (ig) g igg subclasses
and fcgr3b polymorphisms shown mediate antibody-dependent cellular functions. 
malaria antigens studied merozoite surface proteins (msp-1 msp-3),
glutamate rich protein (glurp)-r0, r2, apical membrane antigen (ama-1).
the models evaluated visualization assessment differences
between area receiver operating characteristic curve brier
score estimated suitable internal cross-validation designs.
results: study found fcgr3b-c.233c>a genotype igg ama1 
were relatively better compared antibodies fcgr3b genotypes
studied classifying predicting malaria risk among children.
conclusions: data supports p. falciparum, ama1 important malaria
vaccine antigen, fcgr3b-c.233c>a additive dominant models 
inheritance could important modifier effect malaria protective
antibodies.
