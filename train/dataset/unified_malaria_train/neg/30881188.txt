background: long-tailed pig-tailed macaque monkeys natural hosts of
plasmodium knowlesi, identified fifth malaria parasite
infecting humans. study, investigated possible infection this
plasmodium parasite macaque monkeys using combination polymerase chain
reaction amplification sequencing.
methods: forty-five blood samples obtained 2010 macaques northern
myanmar near yunnan province china investigated possible infection
with plasmodium species using nested polymerase chain reaction method for
amplification 18s ssu rrna genes.
results: positive amplification obtained one monkey, sequence
and phylogenetic analysis indicated parasite hepatocystis
species lineage.
conclusion: results suggest combination polymerase chain reaction
amplification sequence identification would necessary detection of
plasmodium knowlesi infection humans natural hosts.
