the sequences 18s 28s rdna extensively used molecular markers
to resolve phylogenetic relationships among various myxosporeans infecting
fishes. two novel myxosporeans identified present study
namely, henneguya latiusii sp. nov. infecting gills crossocheilus latius and
myxobolus atkinsoni sp. nov. infecting gills labeo rohita inhabiting ranjit
sagar wetland, punjab (india). myxosporeans formed plasmodia gill
arch gill lamellae respectively infection moderate (gill plasmodium
index, gpi: 2). myxospores species possessed distinct morphological
and morphometric characteristics hence validated new species.
phylogenetically, h. latiusii sp. nov. closest h. doneci infecting gill
filaments carassius auratus gibelio, 96% 74% similarity 18s and
28s rdna respectively. similarly, m. atkinsoni sp. nov. showed close homogeneity 
of 90% m. turpisrotundus 83% m. nielii infecting gills carassius
auratus. phylogenetic analyses species myxobolus henneguya showed a
tendency cluster according order family host, tissue and
geographical location. study first report lsu gene marker (28s
rdna) standardized myxozoans infecting fresh water fishes indian
subcontinent.
