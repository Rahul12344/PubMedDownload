the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir) play fundamental role in
the innate immune system, interactions human leucocyte antigen
(hla) molecules, leading modulation activity natural killer (nk)
cells, mainly related killing pathogen-infected cells. kir genes hugely
polymorphic number genes individual carries number
of alleles identified. previously developed allele frequency net
database (afnd, http://www.allelefrequencies.net), captures worldwide
frequencies alleles, genes haplotypes several immune genes, including 
kir genes, healthy populations, covering >4 million individuals. here, we
report creation new database within afnd, named kir diseases
database (kddb), capturing large quantity data derived publications 
which kir genes, alleles, genotypes and/or haplotypes associated with
infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis c, hiv, malaria), autoimmune disorders (e.g. 
type diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis), cancer pregnancy-related
complications. kddb created extensive manual curation effort,
extracting data thousand kir-disease records, comprising >50 000
individuals. kddb thus provides new community resource understanding not
only kir genes associated disease, also, working tandem
with large data sets already present afnd, particular genes,
genotypes haplotypes present worldwide populations different ethnic 
groups. anticipate kddb important resource researchers
working immunogenetics. database url:
