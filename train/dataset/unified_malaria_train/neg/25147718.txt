background: genetic diversity provided plasmodium falciparum the
potential capacity avoiding immune response, possibly supported the
natural selection drug vaccine-resistant parasites. merozoite surface
protein-3 (msp-3) used develop vaccines investigate genetic
diversity regarding p. falciparum malaria iran.
objectives: main goal study analyze polymorphic antigen
msp-3 genes across southeast iran among four different districts, identify 
the differences allele frequency genetic diversity.
materials methods: nested polymerase chain reaction amplification used to
determine polymorphisms n-terminal region msp-3 gene. total 85
microscopically positive p. falciparum infected individuals southeast of
iran included study.
results: 85 confirmed p. falciparum samples obtained four different
districts, 72 successfully scored msp-3.the msp-3 allele classes (k1 and
3d7 types) showed comparable prevalence districts. overall frequencies 
k1 3d7 allele classes 94.5 % both.
conclusions: since study yet looked extent p. falciparum msp-3
in geographic region, data helpful support development 
vaccine based msp-3 malaria. comparative analysis in
different seasonal peaks indicate allelic polymorphism msp-3 a
period.
