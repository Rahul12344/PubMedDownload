platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (pecam1/cd31), receptor
recognized p. falciparum-infected red blood cells (irbcs), vascular
endothelium implicated mediating cytoadherence patients p.
falciparum malaria. examine associations pecam1 polymorphisms cerebral
malaria, 11 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pecam1 analysed
for 312 thai patients p. falciparum malaria (109 cerebral malaria and
203 mild malaria). rs1122800-c allele significantly associated 
protection cerebral malaria (p = 0.017), rs9912957-a significantly
increased risk cerebral malaria (p = 0.0065) malaria patients.
fine-scale mapping using genotyped imputed snps linkage disequilibrium
(ld) analysis revealed rs1122800 rs9912957 located two distinct 
ld blocks independently associated cerebral malaria. the
rs1122800-c allele significantly associated lower expression level of
pecam1 ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (p = 0.045). present
results suggest pecam1-mediated cytoadherence irbcs brain endothelium 
plays crucial role pathogenesis cerebral malaria.
