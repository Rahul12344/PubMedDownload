novel strategies directly thwart malaria transmission needed maintain
the gains achieved current control measures. transmission-blocking
interventions (tbis), namely vaccines drugs targeting parasite mosquito
molecules required vector-stage parasite development, recognized as
promising approaches preventing malaria transmission. however, number 
tbi targets limited degree conservation among major
vector-parasite systems causing human disease unclear. therefore, discovery
and characterization novel proteins involved vector-stage parasite
development plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax paramount. mined 
the recent anopheles gambiae midgut lipid raft proteome putative
mosquito-derived tbi targets characterized secreted glycoconjugate of
unknown function, agsgu. analyzed molecular variation protein among 
range anopheline mosquitoes, determined transcriptomic proteomic
profiles, conducted standard direct membrane feeding assays p. 
falciparum (lab/field) p. vivax (field) an. gambiae anopheles dirus.
we observed α-agsgu antibodies significantly reduced midgut infection
intensity lab field isolates p. falciparum an. gambiae an.
dirus. however, transmission-reducing effects noted comparable
concentrations antibodies included p. vivax-infected blood meals.
although antibodies agsgu exhibit transmission-reducing activity, the
high antibody titer required achieving 80% reduction oocyst intensity
precludes consideration malaria mosquito-based tbi candidate. however,
our results suggest p. falciparum p. vivax ookinetes use different
repertoire midgut surface glycoproteins invasion α-agsgu
antibodies, well antibodies mosquito-midgut microvillar surface
proteins, may prove useful tools interrogating plasmodium-mosquito
interactions.
