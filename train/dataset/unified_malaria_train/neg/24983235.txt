the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum exports several hundred proteins 
the infected erythrocyte involved cellular remodeling severe
virulence. export mechanism involves plasmodium export element (pexel),
which cleavage site parasite protease, plasmepsin v (pmv). pmv
gene refractory deletion, suggesting essential, definitive proof 
is lacking. here, generated pexel-mimetic inhibitor potently blocks the
activity pmv isolated p. falciparum plasmodium vivax. assessment of
pmv activity p. falciparum revealed pexel cleavage occurs cotranslationaly,
similar signal peptidase. treatment p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes
with inhibitor caused dose-dependent inhibition pexel processing well
as protein export, including impaired display major virulence adhesin,
pfemp1, erythrocyte surface, cytoadherence. inhibitor killed
parasites trophozoite stage knockdown pmv enhanced sensitivity to
the inhibitor, overexpression pmv increased resistance. provides
the first direct evidence pmv activity essential protein export in
plasmodium spp. parasite survival human erythrocytes validates pmv
as antimalarial drug target.
