background: using indicators disease severity, clinicians predict which
plasmodium falciparum (pf) malaria patients treated artesunate or
quinine likely die despite drugs. effective "rescue adjuncts" are
needed drugs alone inadequate. "therapeutically-rational exchange"
(t-rex) special malaria-resistant red blood cells (rbcs) proposed 
optimize adjunctive exchange transfusion.
methods: studies reviewed (1) quantified group-o status and
"sickle-trait" (hbas) "c-trait" (hbac) hemoglobins affect pf mortality, risk 
of thrombosis, birth outcomes women pregnancy associated malaria
(pam), (2) reported prevalences "dual-gene" malaria-resistant rbcs, (3)
reflected level exchange-transfusion malaria-related expertise in
benin nigeria.
results: data show malaria- thrombosis-resistance rbcs depend 
specific genes patient's clinical status medical history. in
malaria-endemic benin nigeria, prevalences "dual-gene" malaria-resistant
group-o hbas group-o hbac rbcs substantial, malaria- and
exchange-related expertise outstanding.
conclusions: t-rex "dual-gene" malaria-resistant rbcs feasible benin and
nigeria warrants evaluation rescue adjunct 3 subsets pf-malaria
patients. therapeutic use, group-o hbas rbcs likely effective 
than non-o hbas rbcs pf-infected patients (1) history of
thrombosis (2) taking birth-control hormones group-o hbac rbcs may
substantially improve birth outcomes women pam. studies suggest is
prudent assume - proven otherwise - t-rex "dual-gene"
malaria-resistant rbcs improve ("personalize") rescue patient
subsets.
