drug development efforts focused mostly asexual blood stages the
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum except primaquine, own
limitations, available drugs target transmission the
parasite mosquitoes. therefore, need validate new parasite
proteins targeted blocking transmission. p. falciparum
calcium-dependent protein kinases (pfcdpks) play critical roles various stages
of parasite life cycle and, importantly, absent human host. 
features mark attractive drug targets. study, using crispr/cas9
we successfully knocked pfcdpk2 blood-stage parasites, was
previously thought indispensable protein. growth rate pfcdpk2
knockout (ko) parasites similar wild-type parasites, confirming
that pfcdpk2 function essential asexual proliferation the
parasite vitro mature male female gametocytes pfcdpk2 ko parasites 
become round induction. however, fail infect female anopheles
stephensi mosquitoes due defect(s) male gametocyte exflagellation and
possibly female gametes.importance despite reductions number deaths 
it causes, malaria continues leading infectious disease developing
world. effective control elimination malaria, multiple stages the
parasite need targeted. one stage includes transmission the
parasite mosquitoes. here, demonstrate successful knockout pfcdpk2, 
which previously thought indispensable parasite growth red blood
cells. pfcdpk2 ko parasites incapable establishing infection in
mosquitoes. therefore, study suggests targeting pfcdpk2 may good
strategy control malaria transmission countries high transmission.
moreover, molecular understanding signaling pathway pfcdpk2 may provide
additional targets malaria control.
