apicomplexan parasites amongst prevalent morbidity-causing
pathogens worldwide. responsible severe diseases humans and
livestock thus great public health economic importance. 
sequencing apicomplexan genomes beginning century, the
occurrence n- o-glycoproteins parasites much debated. the
synthesis rudimentary divergent n-glycans due lineage-specific gene
loss well established recently reviewed. here, focus 
on recent studies clarified classical o-glycosylation pathways described
new nucleocytosolic glycosylations toxoplasma gondii, causative agents 
toxoplasmosis. also review glycosylation proteins containing
thrombospondin type 1 repeats o-fucosylation c-mannosylation, newly
discovered toxoplasma malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. the
functional significance post-translational modifications only
started emerge, evidence points towards roles protein
glycosylation pathways tissue cyst wall rigidity persistence host, 
oxygen sensing, stability proteins involved host invasion.
