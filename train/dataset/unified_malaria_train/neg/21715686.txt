identification correlates protection infectious diseases including
malaria major challenge become one main obstacles in
developing effective vaccines. investigated protection liver-stage
malaria conferred vaccination adenoviral (ad) modified vaccinia
ankara (mva) vectors expressing pre-erythrocytic malaria ags. classifying
cd8(+) cells effector, effector memory (t(em)), central memory subsets
using cd62l cd127 markers, found striking differences cell memory
generation. although mva induced accelerated central memory cell generation,
which could efficiently boosted subsequent ad administration, failed 
protect malaria. contrast, ad vectors, permit persistent ag
delivery, elicit prolonged effector cell t(em) response requires
long intervals efficient boost. preferential t(em) phenotype was
maintained liver, blood, spleen ad/mva prime-boost regimens, and
animals protected malaria sporozoite challenge. blood cd8(+) t(em)
cells correlated protection malaria liver-stage infection, assessed 
by estimation number parasites emerging liver blood. 
protective ability ag-specific t(em) cells confirmed transfer
experiments naive recipient mice. thus, identify persistent cd8 t(em)
populations essential vaccine-induced pre-erythrocytic protection 
malaria, finding important implications vaccine design.
