background: despite widespread parasite resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(sp) use intermittent preventative treatment pregnancy remains the
policy benin throughout sub-saharan africa.
methods: prospective study, 982 pregnant women recruited benin and
followed delivery. prevalence point mutations pfdhfr and
pfdhps genes associated plasmodium falciparum resistance sp during
consecutive antenatal visits determined. parasites clearance among women
infected sp intake assessed microscopy pcr. association the
persistence parasites malaria consequences, investigated. recurrent
parasites genotyped identify recrudescences re-infections.
results: prevalence pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutants (triple
pfdhfr + single pfdhps) consistently 80% quintuple sextuple
mutants remained low. importantly higly mutated parasites apparently never
included two key mutations, pfdhfr 164 l pfdhps 540e. based pcr
results, sp failed clear existing parasitaemia half (48%) women 
were infected iptp schedule. frequency recrudescence reached 76% 
the second dose. women persistent parasitaemia increased prevalence
of anaemia (p = 0.03).
conclusion: data presented here, highlight inability sp ensure
optimal antiplasmodial protection late pregnancy, invite urgent
consideration alternative drug strategy.
