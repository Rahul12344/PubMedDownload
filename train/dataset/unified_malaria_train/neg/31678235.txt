g6pd deficiency results numerous mutations g6pd gene cause
alterations enzyme function varying degrees. p. vivax malaria infections
require g6pd deficiency screening potential risk haemolysis 
the gametocytocidal drug (primaquine) radical treatment. present
study investigated incidence g6pd deficiency northeast india and
further, molecular characterization performed. 2014-16, total of
1,015 patients four north-eastern states india (tripura, mizoram,
meghalaya & arunachal pradesh), screened g6pd deficiency, using
beutler's fluorescence spot test (fst) confirmed span g6pd kit. the
deficient individuals (55/1015, 5.4%) characterized pcr-rflp 
dna sequencing except one case lost follow up. observed fst, the
frequency g6pd deficient males (42/538, 7.8%) found higher than
females (13/477, 2.73%), (p < 0.0001). two non-synonymous mutations; g6pd-d
(mahidol)487a (48/54, 88.9%; 36 hemizygous males, 8 homozygous 4 heterozygous
females) g6pd-d (acores)595t (2/54, 3.7%) identified. remaining (4/54,
7.4%) individuals could characterized. molecular modeling dynamic
simulations performed g6pd wild-type (g6pd-wt) enzyme its
variants. in-silico results demonstrated alterations secondary
structures & crucial loss ligand-protein interactions, might result in
reduced enzyme function, leading enzyme deficiency. best our
knowledge, first report document g6pd-mahidol g6pd-acores
variants malaria-endemic regions northeast india, provided molecular 
insights varied genetic makeup studied population.
