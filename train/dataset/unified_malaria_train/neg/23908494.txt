molecular surveillance drug-resistant malaria parasites requires reliable,
timely, scalable methods. data may efficiently produced by
genotyping parasite populations using second-generation sequencing (sgs). we
designed validated sgs protocol quantify mutant allele frequencies in
the plasmodium falciparum genes dhfr dhps mixed isolates. applied 
new protocol field isolates children compared standard
genotyping using sanger sequencing. sgs protocol accurately quantified dhfr
and dhps allele frequencies mixture parasite strains. using sgs dna
that extracted pooled individual isolates, estimated mutant 
allele frequencies closely correlated estimated sanger
sequencing (correlations, >0.98). sgs protocol obviated molecular steps 
in conventional methods cost saving parasite populations >50. sgs
genotyping method efficiently reproducibly estimates parasite allele
frequencies within populations p. falciparum molecular epidemiologic
studies.
