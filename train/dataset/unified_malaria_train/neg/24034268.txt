background: circumsporozoite protein (csp) essential sporozoite formation 
and sporozoite invasion human hepatocyte. previously, recombinant p. vivax
csp based chimeric repeats (rpvcsp-c) representing two major alleles vk210 and
vk247 within central region designed. naturally acquired humoral immune 
responses study show antigenicity rpvcsp-c much higher of
native strain. however, serologic reactivity rpvcsp-c still unclear in
detail.
methods: present study, recognition rpvcsp-c vivax malaria typed vk210
and vk247 alleles assessed. vk210 typed vk247 typed sera adult
residents reacted specifically rpvcsp-c using protein array immunoblot
assay. additionally, anti-rpvcsp-c serum recognized fixed vk210 vk247
sporozoites immunofluorescence assay. furthermore, statistic analysis was
performed correlational detection.
results: rpvcsp-c reacted vk210 typed vk247 typed p. vivax
infected patient sera anti-rpvcsp-c immune serum also reacted vk210 
vk247 sporozoite parasites p. vivax specifically. positive
correlation increased antibody level, age patients also associated
with pvcsp repeat number, although level responses vary considerably
in reactivity rpvcsp-c negative high level within 
age group.
conclusions: data confirmed serologic reactivity novel rpvcsp-c 
in exposed vk210 vk247 populations. results strongly suggested
that recombinant csp biologically active potently immunogenic across
major strains raised prospect protein could used as
serologic marker.
