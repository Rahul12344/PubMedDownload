there increasing interest development effective mosquito repellents 
of natural origin reduce transmission diseases malaria yellow
fever. achieve employed vitro competition assay involving
odorant-binding proteins (obps) malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, 
a predominantly female expression bias identify plant essential oils (eos)
containing bioactive compounds target mosquito olfactory function. eos and
their fractions capable binding obps displayed repellence against
female mosquitoes laboratory repellent assay. repellent eos subjected
to gas chromatographic analysis linked antennogram (eag) recordings from
female a. gambiae identify biologically active constituents. among these
compounds cumin alcohol, carvacrol, ethyl cinnamate butyl cinnamate proved as
effective deet equivalent dose repellent assay, combinations 
of carvacrol either butyl cinnamate cumin alcohol proved be
significantly effective deet assay. tested spatial
repellents experimental shelters housing sleeping humans northern nigeria a
binary mixture carvacrol plus cumin alcohol caused mosquitoes leave
shelters significantly higher numbers induced deet female
anopheles spp. numbers equivalent deet culex spp.
mosquitoes. findings indicate approach identification of
biologically active molecules natural origin serving repellents for
mosquitoes.
