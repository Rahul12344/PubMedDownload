the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum dramatically remodels host red
blood cell enhance survival, using secretory membrane system it
establishes outside cell. cisternal organelles, called maurer's clefts,
act staging point forward trafficking virulence proteins the
red blood cell (rbc) membrane. ring-exported protein-1 (rex1) maurer's
cleft resident protein. show inducible knockdown rex1 causes stacking 
of maurer's cleft cisternae without disrupting organization the
knob-associated histidine-rich protein rbc membrane. genetic dissection of
the rex1 sequence shows loss repeat sequence domain results the
formation giant maurer's cleft stacks. stacked maurer's clefts are
decorated tether-like structures retain ability dock onto rbc
membrane skeleton. rex1 mutant parasites show deficient export major
virulence protein, pfemp1, red blood cell surface markedly reduced
binding endothelial cell receptor, cd36. rex1 predicted form a
largely α-helical structure, repetitive charge pattern repeat
sequence domain, providing potential insights role rex1 maurer's
cleft sculpting.
