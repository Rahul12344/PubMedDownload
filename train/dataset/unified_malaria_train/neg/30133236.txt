objective: investigate effect leptin transgenic plasmodium yoelii on
mouse body weight.
methods: construct leptin gene-containing crispr/cas9 recombinant plasmid 
which 5′utr 3′utr mif(macrophage migration inhibitory factor) of
plasmodium yoelli 17xnl strain two ends, exogenous mouse leptin gene was
inserted downstream mif coding region homologous recombination,
resulting pyc-mif-leptin recombinant plasmid. recombinant plasmid 
then electroporated p. 17xnl mature schizonts, transgenic
schizonts used infect kunming mouse via tail vein injection. the
trangenic p. clone screened pyrimethamine selection identified by
pcr. trangenic wild-type p. used infect c57bl/6 mouse
respectively. blood sample collected eye ball tail vein, and
immunofluorescence rt-pcr performed determine expression of
leptin protein parasites. finally, pbs (200 μl) containing trangenic or
wild-type p. (1 × 104) injected tail vein c57bl/6 mice(n =
5 respectively). negative control received volume pbs. changes 
of parasitemia body weight recorded every two days.
results: leptin-expressing recombinant plasmid pyc-mif-leptin constructed
successfully. results dna sequencing transgenic parasites confirmed the
integration leptin gene downstream mif gene successful
transcription. immunofluorescence results indicated successful expression of
mouse leptin protein. weight loss significant mice infected with
transgenic parasites day 17(17.26 ± 1.40)g, decreased 10.7%, the
other two groups. transgenic wild-type parasites began decline when
parasitemia reached 10%, transgenic parasites proliferated more
rapidly. disappeared 23 days.
conclusion: infection leptin transgenic parasites decreases body weight 
of infected mice.
