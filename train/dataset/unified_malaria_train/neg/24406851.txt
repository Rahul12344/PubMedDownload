given evolution spread resistance sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(sp) documented quick pace worldwide, present study
investigated mutant plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
108-asparagine (dhfr 108 n) key marker resistance combination
among parasite isolates hodeidah. association parasitologic indices
with dhfr 108 n mutant allele also studied. ninety patients with
microscopically confirmed p. falciparum infection hodeidah included 
the present study. polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism approach adopted molecular detection marker. the
dhfr 108 n detected among 61% p. falciparum isolates, pure
and mixed-type forms, hodeidah. age, gender residence patients were
not significant predictors presence mutant allele among parasite
isolates. contrast, history malaria antimalarial drug intake the
year preceding study well frequent antimalarial drug intake were
significantly associated mutant allele. high frequency dhfr 108 
n among parasites isolates makes role sp questionable partner with
outstanding effectiveness within act, least, near future. sp plus
artesunate monitored antimalarial efficacy regular
intervals, preferably molecular detection resistance-associated
mutations.
