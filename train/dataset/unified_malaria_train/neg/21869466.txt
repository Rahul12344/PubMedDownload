resistance antifolates plasmodium falciparum well described been
observed clinical settings decades. molecular level, point
mutations dhfr gene lead resistance identified, 
crystal structure wildtype mutant dihydrofolate reductase enzymes have
been solved complex native substrate drugs. however, only
beginning understand complexities evolutionary pressures lead 
to evolution drug resistance system. microbial systems allow 
heterologous expression malarial proteins provide tractable way to
investigate patterns evolution inform eventual understanding of
the complex factors influence evolution drug resistance in
clinical settings. paper review work escherichia coli and
saccharomyces cerevisiae expression systems explore fitness landscape of
mutations implicated drug resistance show (i) limited number of
evolutionary pathways resistance followed high probability; (ii)
fitness costs associated maintenance high levels resistance are
modest; (iii) different antifolates may exert opposing selective forces.
