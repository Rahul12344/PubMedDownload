in present study, identified characterised complete coding
sequence babesia orientalis apical membrane antigen 1 (designated bo-ama1); it
is 1803bp length encodes polypeptide 601 amino acids (aa). the
bo-ama-1 gene product (bo-ama1) predicted 67kda size contains a
signal peptide. mature bo-ama1 predicted one transmembrane region 
a short cytoplasmic tail (c-terminal domain). extracellular part bo-ama1
has three functional domains (di, dii diii) 14 conserved cysteine
residues. bo-ama1 fragment containing three domains (designated
bo-ama1-di/ii/iii) cloned plasmid vector pet-28a expressed 
recombinant (his-fusion) protein 53kda. antibodies serum b.
orientalis-infected water buffalo specifically recognised protein in
immunoblotting analysis. rabbit antibodies raised recombinant protein
were able detect native bo-ama1 (67kda) erythrocytes b.
orientalis-infected water buffalo. bo-ama1 new member ama1 family and
might good antigen specific detection antibodies produced b.
orientalis infected cattle. protein likely play critical roles 
host cell adherence invasion b. orientalis, ama1s reported other
organisms plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii. research
is required explore biological functions protein determine 
whether immunisation induce protective effects water buffalo against
b. orientalis infection.
