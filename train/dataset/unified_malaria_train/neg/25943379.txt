background: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) recommended drug for
intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp) african countries, 
including zambia. however, malaria still one leading causes of
morbidity mortality pregnant women despite reports greater 50% 
women taking least two doses sp iptp. studies shown resistance
to sp associated mutations dhfr dhps gene plasmodium
falciparum. study examined prevalence dhfr dhps polymorphisms 
p. falciparum found pregnant women nchelenge district.
method: cross-sectional study conducted 2013 nchelenge, a
holoendemic area malaria prevalence estimated 50% throughout year.
three rural health centres randomly selected census survey carried out
at health centre. questionnaire administered malaria testing done 
using rdt microscopy, collection dried blood spot. chelex
extraction done extract parasite dna dried blood spots followed by
nested pcr enzyme restriction digestion.
results: enrolled participants (n = 375), median age women 
23. prevalence malaria pcr 22%. pcr positive samples examined
(n = 72) showed high prevalence dhfr triple (asn-108 + arg-59 + ile-59)
mutant (68%) dhps double (gly -437 + glu-540) mutant (21%). quintuple
haplotype found 17% 2 samples additional gly-581mutation. 
addition 6% mutations val-16 found none found thr-108
respectively, confer resistance cycloguanil. multivariate analysis 
showed association malaria women aged 30-34 years
old p < 0.05(aor: 0.36) 95% ci.
conclusion: study showed high number mutations dhfr dhps
genes. high malaria endemicity general population area may
have contributed high prevalence resistant parasites pregnant women,
suggesting need examine efficacy sp given only
approved drug iptp zambia.
