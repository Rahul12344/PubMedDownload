background: currently, artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) the
first-line anti-malarial treatment malaria-endemic areas. however, resistance 
in plasmodium falciparum artemisinin-based combinations emerging the
greater mekong sub-region major problem hindering malaria elimination. to
continuously monitor potential spread act-resistant parasites, study 
assessed efficacy artemether-lumefantrine (al) falciparum malaria in
western myanmar.
methods: ninety-five patients malaria symptoms paletwa township, chin
state, myanmar screened p. falciparum infections 2015. after
excluding six patients parasite density 100 150,000/µl, 41
p. falciparum patients treated al followed 28 days. molecular
markers associated resistance 4-amino-quinoline drugs (pfcrt pfmdr1),
antifolate drugs (pfdhps pfdhfr) artemisinin (pfk13) genotyped to
determine prevalence mutations associated anti-malarial drug
resistance.
results: 41 p. falciparum patients (27 children 14 adults), the
28-day al therapeutic efficacy 100%, five cases (12.2%) parasite
positive day 3 microscopy. pfk13 gene, frequency nn insert
after position 136 100% day-3 parasite-positive group compared 
to 50.0% day-3 parasite-negative group, albeit difference not
statistically significant (p = 0.113). pfk13 k189t mutation (10.0%) found
in myanmar first time. pfcrt k76t a220s mutations fixed 
in parasite population. pfmdr1, y184f mutation present 23.3% of
the parasite population, found day-3 parasite-positive -negative 
parasites. g968a mutation pfmdr1 gene first reported myanmar.
prevalence mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes assessed 70%,
with exception pfdhps a581g mutation, 3.3%.
conclusions: al remained highly efficacious western myanmar. pfk13 mutations
associated artemisinin resistance found. high prevalence of
mutations pfcrt, pfdhfr pfdhps suggests high-degree resistance to
chloroquine antifolate drugs. pfmdr1 n86/184f/d1246 haplotype associated 
with selection al africa reached > 20% study. detection
of > 10% patients day-3 parasite-positive al treatment emphasizes 
the necessity continuously monitoring act efficacy western myanmar.
