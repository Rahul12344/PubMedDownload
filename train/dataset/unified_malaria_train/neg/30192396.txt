chikungunya virus (chikv) infection spatiotemporally related dengue virus
(denv) infection mostly undiagnosed due similar primary symptoms. 2013,
a high rate (36%) coinfection denv chikv reported odisha. hence,
the hospital-based study continued synthesis current epidemiological
understanding single distribution coinfection. suspected denv
patients serum samples tested denv chikv serology and
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. positive samples used
for analysis mutation, selection pressure, phylogenetic relationship.
clinical information also analyzed. among 648 (2015 2016) suspected denv 
patients, 141 (21.7%) positive denv (serotypes 1-3), 22 (3.4%) were
positive chikv (ecsa) 4 (2.8%) coinfected both. sequence
analysis showed four consistent mutations (m104v, v112a, k166n, f169l) in
cprm gene denv 2 two consistent mutations (m269v, d284e) e1 gene of
chikv. interestingly, chikv- e1 a226v mutation absent studied
population. also noticed peak incidence infections
occurs august-september 2015-16. moreover, plasmodium species, salmonella
typhi, rickettsial typhi infections also observed denv patients.
different etiology also detected undifferentiated fever patients 
mixed infections (malaria, s. typhi, r. typhi ). hence, investigation
shows significant reduction denv-chikv coinfection compared with
previous report, burden arboviruses acute undifferentiated fever in
odisha 2015-2016, highlighting importance epidemiological picture of
febrile patients appropriate patient management.
