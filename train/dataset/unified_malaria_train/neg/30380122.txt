trans-species polymorphism widely used key sign long-term
balancing selection across multiple species. however, sites often rare
in genome could result mutational processes technical artifacts. 
few methods yet available specifically detect footprints trans-species 
balancing selection without using trans-species polymorphic sites. study,
we develop summary- model-based approaches specifically
tailored uncover regions long-term balancing selection shared set of
species using genomic patterns intraspecific polymorphism interspecific
fixed differences. demonstrate trans-species statistics have
substantially higher power single-species approaches detect footprints of
trans-species balancing selection, robust affect all
tested species. apply model-based methods human chimpanzee 
whole-genome sequencing data. addition previously established major
histocompatibility complex malaria resistance-associated frem3/gype regions, 
we also find outstanding genomic regions involved barrier integrity innate
immunity, grik1/cldn17 intergenic region, slc35f1 abca13 
genes. findings echo significance pathogen defense also
reveal novel candidates maintaining balanced polymorphisms across human and
chimpanzee lineages. finally, show trans-species statistics 
applied work well arbitrary number species, integrate them
into open-source software packages ease use scientific community.
