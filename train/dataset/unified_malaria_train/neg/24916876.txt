introduction: chloroquine resistance plasmodium falciparum associated 
mutations pfcrt pfmdr1 genes. frequency distribution pfcrt k76t and
pfmdr1 n86y mutations association chloroquine susceptibility was
studied endemic area along indo-bangladesh border.
methodology: single-arm prospective study clinical parasitological
responses p. falciparum malaria patients chloroquine conducted vivo.
pcr-rflp assay used detect pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y mutations p.
falciparum. pcr products pfcrt gene sequenced,Â  translated and
aligned haplotyping.
results: 63 cases, 44 (69.8%) responded adequately chloroquine
treatment. pfcrt k76t mutation recorded 100% treatment failure
cases, whereas pfmdr1 n86y mutation found 52.6% cases only. early
treatment failure (84.2%) occurred frequently late treatment failure
(15.8%). kaplan-meier survival analysis showed probability estimate 
treatment success 7 15 days 0.84 (95% ci = 0.72-0.92) 0.70 (95%
ci = 0.57-0.80), respectively. sequence analysis 72 76 pfcrt gene codons
revealed presence two mutant (cvmnt, cviet) two wild (cvmnk, cviek)
haplotypes. mutant cviet haplotype predominantly distributed (42.1%).
conclusions: presence mutations pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y genes not
sufficient explain therapeutic efficacy chloroquine p. falciparum.
study suggests pfcrt k76t mutant haplotypes widely distributed are
spreading diligently, needs taken account devising an
antimalarial policy.
