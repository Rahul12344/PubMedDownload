background: confirmation artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance plasmodium 
falciparum along thai-myanmar border inspired global response to
contain monitor drug resistance avert disastrous consequences a
potential spread africa. however, resistance data myanmar sparse,
particularly high-risk areas limited health services decades of
displacement create conditions resistance spread. subclinical infections
may represent important reservoir resistance genes confer fitness
disadvantage relative wild-type alleles. study estimates prevalence
of resistance genotypes three previously unstudied remote populations in
myanmar tests priori hypothesis resistance gene prevalence would
be higher among isolates collected subclinical infections isolates
collected febrile clinical patients. systematic review resistance
studies provided context.
methods: community health workers karen kachin states area spanning
the indo-myanmar border collected dried blood spots 988 febrile clinical
patients 4,591 villagers subclinical infection participating routine 
prevalence surveys. samples positive p. falciparum 18 ribosomal rna by
real-time pcr genotyped p. falciparum multidrug resistance protein
(pfmdr1) copy number pfcrt k76t polymorphism using multiplex real-time
pcr.
results: pfmdr1 copy number increase pfcrt k76 polymorphism were
determined 173 269 isolates, respectively. mean pfmdr1 copy number was
1.2 (range: 0.7 3.7). pfmdr1 copy number increase present 17.5%, 9.6%
and 11.1% isolates karen kachin states indo-myanmar border,
respectively. pfmdr1 amplification prevalent subclinical isolates
(20.3%) clinical isolates (6.4%, odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1
- 12.5). pfcrt k76t prevalence ranged 90-100%.
conclusions: community health workers contribute molecular surveillance of
drug resistance remote areas myanmar. marginal displaced populations
under-represented among previous resistance investigations be
included resistance surveillance efforts, particularly genetic markers of
artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance identified. subclinical infections may
contribute epidemiology drug resistance, determination gene
amplification desiccated filter samples requires validation dna
concentration low.
