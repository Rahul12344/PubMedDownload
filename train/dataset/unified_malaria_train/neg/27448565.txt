background: drugs kill inhibit plasmodium gametocytes human host
could potentially synergize impact chemotherapeutic interventions by
blocking transmission. develop agents, reliable methods needed to
study vitro activity compounds gametocytes. study
describes novel assay characterizing activity anti-malarial drugs
against later stages plasmodium falciparum gametocyte development using
real-time pcr (qpcr).
methods: genes previously reported transcribed different sexual
stages gametocytogenesis selected study mrna expression
was measured gametocytogenesis course qpcr. genes mainly expressed the
later stages gametocyte development used surrogate measurement of
drug activity. distinguish cidal static drug effects, two
different experiments performed parallel, one constant drug pressure
throughout experiment (144 h), another gametocyte cultures
were exposed compound 48 h.
results: four p. falciparum genes coding proteins pf77, rom3, pfs25, and
pfg377 transcription specific late-stage gametocyte development were
identified. vitro anti-malarial activity compounds such
gametocytes assessed measuring mrna levels genes using qpcr. 
assay validated standard anti-malarial drugs (epoxomicin,
dihydroartemisinin, chloroquine, thiostrepton, methylene blue) compounds 
from gsk compound library known anti-gametocyte activity.
conclusions: study describes novel assay characterizing activity
of anti-malarial drugs later stages p. falciparum gametocyte
development using qpcr genetically unmodified parasites. method described 
is reliable user-friendly technique medium throughput could 
easily implemented laboratory.
