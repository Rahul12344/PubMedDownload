abscisic acid (aba) ancient stress hormone detectable wide
variety organisms regulates innate immunity inflammation.
previously, showed oral supplementation aba decreased parasitemia in
a mouse model malaria, decreased liver spleen pathology reduced
parasite transmission mosquitoes. here, report higher circulating aba 
levels associated reduced risk symptomatic malaria cohort 
plasmodium falciparum-infected ugandan children. understand possible
mechanisms aba protection malaria, returned mouse model show
that aba effects plasmodium yoelii 17xnl infection accompanied minimal
effects complete blood count blood chemistry analytes, suggesting a
benefit host health. addition, orally delivered aba induced patterns of
gene expression mouse liver spleen suggested enhancement host
anti-parasite defenses. test inferences, utilized passive
immunization knockout mice demonstrate aba supplementation increases 
circulating levels protective, parasite-specific igg requires caspase-1 to
reduce parasitemia. collectively, aba induces host responses ameliorate
infection disease animal model suggest studies aba 
in context human malaria warranted.
