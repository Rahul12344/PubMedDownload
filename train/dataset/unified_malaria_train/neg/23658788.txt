successful development plasmodium mosquito essential the
transmission malaria. major bottleneck parasite numbers occurs during
midgut invasion, partly consequence complex interactions 
endogenous microbiota mosquito immune response. previously identified 
srpn6 immune component restricts plasmodium berghei development in
the mosquito. demonstrate srpn6 differentially activated by
bacteria anopheles stephensi, bacteria exposure occurs the
lumenal surface midgut epithelium. data indicate assrpn6 is
strongly induced following exposure enterobacter cloacae, common component
of mosquito midgut microbiota. conclude assrpn6 vital component 
of e. cloacae-mediated immune response restricts plasmodium development 
in mosquito an. stephensi.
