egress malaria parasites host cell requires concerted rupture 
its enveloping membranes. hence, investigated role plasmodial
perforin-like protein pplp2 egress plasmodium falciparum from
erythrocytes. pplp2 expressed blood stage schizonts mature gametocytes.
the protein localizes vesicular structures, activated gametocytes
discharge pplp2 calcium-dependent manner. pplp2 comprises macpf domain and
recombinant pplp2 haemolytic activities towards erythrocytes. pplp2-deficient
[pplp2(-)] merozoites show normal egress dynamics erythrocytic
replication cycle, activated pplp2(-) gametocytes unable leave
erythrocytes stayed trapped within cells. parasitophorous
vacuole membrane ruptured normally, activated pplp2(-) gametocytes were
unable permeabilize erythrocyte membrane release erythrocyte
cytoplasm. consequence, transmission pplp2(-) parasites anopheles
vector reduced. pore-forming equinatoxin ii rescued pplp2(-) gametocyte 
exflagellation parasite transmission. pore sealant tetronic 90r4, 
other hand, caused trapping activated wild-type gametocytes within the
enveloping erythrocytes, thus mimicking pplp2(-) loss-of-function phenotype. 
we propose haemolytic activity pplp2 essential gametocyte
egress due permeabilization erythrocyte membrane depletion the
erythrocyte cytoplasm.
