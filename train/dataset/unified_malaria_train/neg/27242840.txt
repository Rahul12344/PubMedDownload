artemisia annua, annual herb used traditional chinese medicine, produces 
wealth monoterpenes sesquiterpenes, including well-known sesquiterpene
lactone artemisinin, active ingredient treatment malaria. we
report three new monoterpene synthases a. annua. glandular trichome
cdna library, monoterpene synthases aatps2, aatps5, aatps6, isolated 
and characterized. recombinant proteins aatps5 aatps6 produced
multiple products camphene 1,8-cineole major products, respectively, 
and aatps2 produced single product, Î²-myrcene. although mg(2+) mn(2+) 
were able support catalytic activities, altered product spectrum was
observed presence mn(2+) aatps2 aatps5. analysis extracts of
aerial tissues root a. annua gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
detected 20 monoterpenes, three enzymes constituted more
than 1/3 total. mechanical wounding induced expression three
monoterpene synthase genes, transcript levels aatps5 aatps6 also 
elevated treatments phytohormones methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid,
and gibberellin, suggesting role monoterpene synthases in
plant-environment interactions. three new monoterpene synthases reported here
further understanding molecular basis monoterpene biosynthesis and
regulation plant.
