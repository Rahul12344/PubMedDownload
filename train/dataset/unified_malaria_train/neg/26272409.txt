malaria devastating infectious disease caused blood-borne
apicomplexan parasites genus plasmodium. pathogens complex
lifecycle, includes development anopheline mosquito vector in
the liver red blood cells mammalian hosts, process takes days to
weeks, depending plasmodium species. productive transmission the
mammalian host mosquito requires transitioning asexual sexual
forms parasite. blood- stage parasites replicate cyclically mostly
asexual, although small fraction convert male female sexual
forms (gametocytes) reproductive cycle. despite many years of
investigation, molecular processes elicit sexual differentiation have
remained largely unknown. review, highlight several important recent
discoveries identified epigenetic factors specific transcriptional 
regulators gametocyte commitment development, providing crucial insights
into obligate cellular differentiation process.
