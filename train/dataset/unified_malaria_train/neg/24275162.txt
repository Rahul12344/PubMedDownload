autophagy catabolic pathway typically induced nutrient starvation to
recycle amino acids, also function removing damaged organelles. in
addition, pathway plays key role eukaryotic development. date, not
much known role autophagy apicomplexan parasites more
specifically human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. comparative
genomic analysis uncovered some, all, orthologs autophagy-related 
(atg) genes malaria parasite genome. here, using genome-wide silico
analysis, confirmed atg genes whose products required vesicle
expansion completion present, genes involved induction of
autophagy cargo packaging mostly absent. subsequently focused the
molecular cellular function p. falciparum atg8 (pfatg8), autophagosome 
membrane marker key component autophagy pathway, throughout the
parasite asexual sexual erythrocytic stages. context, showed 
pfatg8 distinct atypical role parasite development. pfatg8 localized
in apicoplast vesicles throughout cytosol parasite
development. immunofluorescence assays pfatg8 apicoplast-minus parasites
suggest pfatg8 involved apicoplast biogenesis. furthermore, treatment 
of parasite cultures bafilomycin 1 chloroquine, lysosomotropic
agents inhibit autophagosome lysosome fusion, resulted dramatic
morphological changes apicoplast, parasite death. furthermore, deep
proteomic analysis components associated pfatg8 indicated may
possibly involved ribophagy piecemeal microautophagy nucleus.
collectively, data revealed importance specificity autophagy
pathway malaria parasite offer potential novel therapeutic strategies.
