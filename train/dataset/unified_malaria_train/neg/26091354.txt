high throughput immunomics powerful platform discover potential targets
of host immunity develop diagnostic tests infectious diseases. we
screened sera plasmodium vivax-exposed individuals profile antibody
response blood-stage antigens p. vivax using p. vivax protein microarray.
a total 1936 genes encoding p. vivax proteins expressed, printed 
screened sera p. vivax-exposed individuals normal subjects. total
of 151 (7.8% 1936 targets) highly immunoreactive antigens identified,
including five well-characterized antigens p. vivax (etramp11.2, pv34, sub1,
rap2 msp4). among highly immunoreactive antigens, 5 antigens were
predicted adhesins maap, 11 antigens predicted merozoite
invasion-related proteins based homology p. falciparum proteins. there
are 40 proteins serodiagnostic potential antibody surveillance.
these novel plasmodium antigens identified provide clues understanding
host immune response p. vivax infection development antibody
surveillance tools.
