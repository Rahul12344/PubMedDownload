background: lactoferrin natural multifunctional protein known have
antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory activity. apart its
antimicrobial effects, lactoferrin known boost immune response by
enhancing antioxidants. lactoferrin exists various forms depending iron
saturation. present study done observe effect lactoferrin,
isolated bovine buffalo colostrum, red blood cells (rbcs) and
macrophages (human monocytic cell line-derived macrophages thp1 cells).
methods: lactoferrin obtained species different iron saturation 
forms used present study, treatment host cells given with
different forms lactoferrin different concentrations. treated host
cells used various studies, including morphometric analysis, viability
by mtt assay, survivin gene expression, production reactive oxygen species,
phagocytic properties, invasion assay, toll-like receptor-4, toll-like
receptor-9, mdr1 expression, investigate interaction between
lactoferrin host cells possible mechanism action regard to
parasitic infections.
results: mechanism interaction host cells lactoferrin have
shown various aspects gene expression cellular activity depending the
degree iron saturation lactoferrin. significant increase (p<0.05) in
production reactive oxygen species, phagocytic activity, toll-like
receptor expression observed host cells incubated iron-saturated
lactoferrin compared untreated control group. however, 
significant (p>0.05) change percentage viability different groups of
host cells treated, downregulation survivin gene expression found
at 48 hours post-incubation. upregulation toll-like receptor and
downregulation p-gp gene confirmed immunomodulatory potential of
lactoferrin protein.
conclusion: present study details interaction lactoferrin and
parasite host cells, ie, rbcs macrophages, using various cellular processes
and expression studies. study reveals possible mechanism action
against various intracellular pathogens toxoplasma, plasmodium,
leishmania, trypanosoma, mycobacterium. presence iron lactoferrin
plays important role enhancing various activities taking place inside
these cells. work provides lot information targeting lactoferrin 
against many parasitic infections rule exact pathways for
inhibition diseases caused intracellular microbes mainly targeting rbcs and
macrophages survival. therefore, initial study serve a
baseline evaluation mechanism action lactoferrin against
parasitic diseases, fully understood date.
