in nearly non-photosynthetic cells, pantothenate (vitamin b5) transport and
utilization prerequisites synthesis universal essential
cofactor coenzyme (coa). early studies showed human malaria parasites rely
on uptake pantothenate across parasite plasma membrane survival
within erythrocytes. recently, p. falciparum candidate pantothenate transporter
(pat) characterized functional complementation yeast. studies
revealed pfpat mediated survival yeast cells low pantothenate
concentrations restored sensitivity yeast cells lacking pantothenate
uptake fenpropimorph. addition, pfpat refractory deletion p.
falciparum vitro, nothing known vivo functions pat in
plasmodium life cycle stages. herein, used gene-targeting techniques delete
pat plasmodium yoelii. parasites lacking pat displayed normal asexual and
sexual blood stage development compared wild-type (wt) wt-like p230p(-)
parasites. however, progression ookinete oocyst stage and
sporozoite formation completely abolished pat(-) parasites. studies
provide first evidence essential role candidate pantothenate
transport malaria transmission anopheles mosquitoes. set the
stage development pat inhibitors multiple parasite life cycle 
stages.
