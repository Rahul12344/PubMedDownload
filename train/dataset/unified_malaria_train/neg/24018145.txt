telomere position effect efficiently controls silencing subtelomeric var
genes, involved antigenic variation human malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum. although, pforc1 found associated with
pfsir2 silencing complex, function telomere silencing remained
uncertain especially due apparent lack bah domain amino-terminal 
region. report pforc1 possesses sir3/orc1 like silencing activity.
using yeast surrogate organism shown pforc1 could complement
yeast sir3 activity telomere silencing sir2 dependent manner. by
constructing series chimera pforc1 scsir3 observed 
the amino-terminal domain pforc1 harbors silencing activity similar that
present amino-terminal domain scsir3. generated several
amino-terminal deletion mutants dissect silencing activity found 
that first seventy amino acids amino-terminal domain dispensable
for activity. thus results strongly supports pforc1 may role 
in telomere silencing parasite. finding help decipher the
mechanism telomere position effect p. falciparum.
