in hiv-1-infected patients, variation hla class locus associated with
disease progression, studies assessed influence hla alleles
on hiv-1 crf01_ae infection, dominant thailand. hypothesized 
alleles predicted confer effective immune responses, hla-b*46,
would protect disease progression. hla typing performed hiv-1
incident cases surviving 1998-1999 hiv-1-negative matched controls from
thai army cohorts enrolled 1991 1995. assessed associations
between class alleles disease progression subsequent hla typing.
ninety-nine hiv-1-incident cases followed median 3.7 years after
hla typing; time, 58 participants died. two alleles associated
with mortality: hla b*51 protective (3-year survival b*51(pos) vs. b*51(neg):
75% vs. 52%; p = 0.034) whereas cw*04 deleterious (3-year survival cw*04(pos)
vs. cw*04(neg): 39% vs. 60%; p = 0.027). hla-b*46 associated disease
progression. alleles present different frequencies hiv-1-incident compared 
with hiv-1-negative men included hla-a*02:03, b*35, b*15, c*08. 1. in
conclusion thai army cohort, hla-b*51 associated lower
mortality, confirming allele, protective clade b hiv-1
infection, similar effect hiv crf01_ae infection. deleterious effect
of hla-cw*04 must interpreted caution may linkage
disequilibrium disease-susceptible hla-b alleles. find that
hla-b*46 protective. findings may inform vaccine development areas 
of world hiv-1 crf01_ae infection prevalent.
