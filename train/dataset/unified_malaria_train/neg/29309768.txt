dihydroartemisinin (dha), main active metabolite artemisinin, been
used treat malaria anticancer activities. previous work shown that
dha negative impacts embryos rodents primates. however, whether dha
has adverse effects oocyte maturation unknown. present study, we
evaluated toxic effects possible mechanisms dha porcine oocyte
maturation. results showed exposure dha inhibited porcine oocyte
polar body extrusion, blocked cell cycle progression. meanwhile, early embryo
development parthenogenetic activation also impaired. dha disturbed
spindle morphology actin assembly porcine oocytes reducing
phosphorylation levels mapk. moreover, ros content increased the
mitochondrial membrane potential decreased oocytes treated dha. dha also 
increased levels intracellular mitochondrial calcium. furthermore,
annexin v-fitc staining showed early apoptosis occurred dha-treated
oocytes. mrna levels apoptosis-related genes bax casp3 increased,
and anti-apoptotic gene bcl2 decreased oocytes exposed dha. taken
together, results indicate dha exposure impairs porcine oocyte
maturation vitro via mechanisms involved cytoskeleton dynamics, oxidative
stress, calcium homeostasis, apoptosis.
