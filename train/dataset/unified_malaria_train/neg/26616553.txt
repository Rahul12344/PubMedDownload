although vector safe immunogenic humans, efforts remain on-going
to enhance immunogenicity various approaches using stronger
promoters boost transgene expression. previously reported endogenous
mva promoters pb8 pf11 increased transgene expression and
immunogenicity, compared conventional p7.5 promoter. here, show that
both promoters also rivalled mh5 promoter enhancing mva immunogenicity. we
investigated mechanisms behind improved immunogenicity show 
was result strong early transgene expression vivo, rather vitro
as would normally assessed. moreover, keeping tk gene intact resulted a
modest improvement immunogenicity. utilizing pb8 pf11 ectopic promoters 
at tk locus instead natural loci also increased transgene expression
and immunogenicity. addition reporter antigen, pf11 promoter was
tested expression two vaccine antigens cellular
immunogenicity significantly increased compared p7.5 promoter. 
data support use pf11 pb8 promoters improved immunogenicity in
future mva-vectored candidate vaccines.
