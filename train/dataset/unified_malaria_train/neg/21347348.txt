apicomplexan parasites responsible myriad diseases humans and
livestock; yet despite intensive effort, development effective sub-unit
vaccines remains long-term goal. antigenic complexity inability to
identify protective antigens pool induce response serious
challenges development new vaccines. using combination parasite
genetics selective barriers population-based genetic fingerprinting, 
have identified immunity important apicomplexan parasite of
livestock (eimeria spp.) targeted discrete regions the
genome. herein report identification six genomic regions and, within
two loci, identification true protective antigens confer
immunity sub-unit vaccines. first eimeria maxima homologue 
of apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) second previously
uncharacterised gene termed 'immune mapped protein-1' (imp-1).
significantly, homologues ama-1 antigen protective range of
apicomplexan parasites including plasmodium spp., suggest may be
some characteristic(s) protective antigens shared across diverse group of
parasites. interestingly, homologues imp-1 antigen, protective
against e. maxima infection, identified toxoplasma gondii neospora 
caninum. overall, study documents discovery novel protective antigens
using population-based genetic mapping approach allied protection-based 
screen candidate genes. identification ama-1 imp-1 represents a
substantial step towards development effective anti-eimerian sub-unit
vaccine raises possibility identification novel antigens 
apicomplexan parasites. moreover, validation parasite genetics approach to
identify effective antigens supports adoption parasite systems where
legitimate protective antigen identification difficult.
