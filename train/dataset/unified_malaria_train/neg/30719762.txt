artemisia annua natural source sesquiterpenoid artemisinin,
which widely used treat malaria. phytohormone jasmonic acid (ja) can
significantly promote artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua. aabhlh1 bind 
activate artemisinin biosynthetic genes, aaads aacyp71av1. this
study, proved aabhlh1 responsive meja treatment highly
expressed glandular trichome-enriched tissues, expression profile
was similar aaads. yeast two-hybrid assays showed aabhlh1
interacted nine aajaz proteins a. annua. functional analysis with
transgenic plants showed several artemisinin biosynthetic genes were
upregulated aabhlh1-oe transgenic a. annua lines downregulated in
aabhlh1-ear lines; furthermore, artemisinin content increased the
aabhlh1-oe lines decreased aabhlh1-ear lines. results
demonstrate ja-induced aabhlh1 positively regulates artemisinin
biosynthesis regulating biosynthetic genes, thus provide new insight
into regulatory mechanism ja-induced artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua.
