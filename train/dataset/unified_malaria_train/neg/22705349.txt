plasmodium malariae protozoan parasite causes malaria humans 
genetically indistinguishable plasmodium brasilianum, parasite infecting
new world monkeys central south america. p. malariae wide patchy
global distribution tropical subtropical regions, found south
america, asia, africa. however, little known regarding genetics of
these parasites similarity could 
are genomic sequences available simian plasmodium species.
this study presents first molecular epidemiological data p. malariae 
p. brasilianum brazil obtained different hosts uses explore
the genetic diversity relation geographical origin hosts. using
microsatellite genotyping, discovered 14 human samples obtained
from areas atlantic forest, 5 different multilocus genotypes were
recorded, sample infected mosquito region a
different haplotype found. also analyzed longitudinal change of
circulating plasmodial genetic profile two untreated non-symptomatic patients 
during 12-months interval. circulating genotypes two samples from
the patient presented nearly identical multilocus haplotypes (differing a
single locus). frequent haplotype persisted almost 3 years the
human population. allele pm09-299 described previously genetic marker
for south american p. malariae found samples. 3 non-human
primate samples amazon region, 3 different multilocus genotypes were
recorded indicating greater diversity among isolates p. brasilianum compared
to p. malariae thus, p. malariae might fact derive p. brasilianum 
has proposed recent studies. taken together, data show based 
the microsatellite data relatively restricted polymorphism p.
malariae parasites opposed geographic locations.
