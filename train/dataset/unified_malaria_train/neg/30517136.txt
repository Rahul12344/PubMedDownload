the malaria parasite replicates within erythrocytes. pathogenesis clinical
malaria large part due capacity parasite remodel host 
cell. this, intraerythrocytic stages plasmodium falciparum export more
than 300 proteins dramatically alter morphology infected
erythrocyte well mechanical adhesive properties. p. falciparum
plasmepsin v (pfpmv) aspartic protease processes proteins export
into host erythrocyte thought play key role parasite virulence
and survival. however, although standard techniques gene disruption well
as conditional protein knockdown previously attempted pfpmv
gene, complete gene removal knockdown achieved direct genetic proof
that pmv essential protein established. used a
conditional gene excision approach combining crispr-cas9 gene editing and
dicre-mediated recombination functionally inactivate pfpmv gene. the
resulting mutant parasites displayed severe growth defect. detailed phenotypic 
analysis showed development mutant parasites arrested early in
the ring-to-trophozoite transition erythrocytic cycle following gene
excision. findings first elucidate effects pmv gene
disruption, showing essential parasite viability asexual blood 
stages. mutant parasites used platform dissect the
plasmodium protein export pathway.
