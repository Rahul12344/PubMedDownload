plain-language-summary: bodies insects encased exoskeleton or
cuticle key survival. cuticle helps protect insects against
damage, prevents water loss defend pesticides. better
understanding role cuticle survival mosquitoes other
insects could lead new ways prevent spread diseases malaria.
the cuticle coated various molecules group chemicals called
hydrocarbons. coating made specialized cells called oenocytes and
helps protect insects. hydrocarbons also influence communications 
certain insects acting recognition signals. mosquitoes, oenocytes make
several hydrocarbons using set processes well understood, and
the types hydrocarbons make vary individuals same
species. unclear mixture hydrocarbons generated how
differences mixture determine mosquitoes adapt their
surroundings. grigoraki et al. studied genes active isolated
oenocytes mosquito anopheles gambiae, carries parasite that
causes malaria. study revealed set genes highly active in
oenocytes control production fatty acids, group molecules used to
make hydrocarbons. genes involved creating hydrocarbons also found.
grigoraki et al. investigated specific gene called fas1899 showed
that loss gene reduces overall hydrocarbon production 25%.
additionally, genes transporting recycling molecules producing
fats also shown active, may indicate oenocytes a
variety unexplored roles besides making hydrocarbons. grigoraki et al.
identify genes involved producing hydrocarbon coating mosquitoes
and demonstrate significance. work needed understand the
precise roles genes regulated adapt the
hydrocarbon coating different situations. help explain the
hydrocarbon coating changes mosquitoes, example response use 
insecticides climate change. information important adapt and
develop new tools improve mosquito control.
