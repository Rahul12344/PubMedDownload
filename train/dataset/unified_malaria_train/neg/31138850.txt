liver stage plasmodium parasites reside parasitophorous vacuole (pv) that
associates lysosomes. previously shown organelles can
have beneficial well harmful effects parasite. yet clear
how association lysosomes parasite controlled how
interactions organelles lead antagonistic outcomes. this
study used advanced imaging techniques characterize lysosomal interactions 
with pv. host cells harboring successfully developing parasites we
observed interaction events reach equilibrium pv membrane
(pvm). population arrested parasites, equilibrium appeared shift 
towards strongly increased lysosomal fusion pvm witnessed strong
pvm labeling lysosomal marker protein lamp1. followed by
acidification pv elimination parasite. systematically
investigate elimination arrested parasites, generated transgenic parasites 
that express photosensitizer killerred, leads parasite killing after
activation. work provides insights cellular details intracellular
killing lysosomal elimination plasmodium parasites independent cells of
the immune system.
