many malaria antigens contain multiple disulphide bonds involved formation
of inhibitory b-cell epitopes. producing properly folded malaria antigens in
sufficient quantities vaccination often challenge. 42-kda fragment
of plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (msp142 ) kind 
malaria antigen. study, investigated expression msp142 a
rice system (9522, cultivar oryza sativa ssp. japonica), used a
bioreactor protein production. msp142 gene synthesized according to
rice-preferred codons transformed rice plants via an
agrobacterium-mediated method. recombinant antigen efficiently expressed 
in rice seeds level 1.56% total soluble protein was
recognized conformational monoclonal antibody 5.2 (mab5.2) the
pooled sera p. falciparum malaria patients. rabbits immunized
intramuscularly purified msp142 formulated freund's adjuvant. high 
antibody titres msp142 elicited. rabbit immune sera reacted well
with native protein p. falciparum parasite strongly inhibited in
vitro growth blood-stage p. falciparum parasites, demonstrating that
transgenic rice become efficient bioreactor production malaria 
vaccine antigens.
