artemisia annua l. used throughout asia africa tea press juice to
treat malaria related symptomes (fever, chills). active ingredient,
artemisinin (ars), developed antimalarial drug used worldwide.
interestingly, bioactivity restricted malaria treatment. and
others found ars-type drugs also reveal anticancer vitro vivo. 
this review, give systematic overview literature published the
past two decades end 2016. like natural products, ars acts 
a multi-specific manner tumors. cellular response ars its
derivatives (dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, arteether) towards
cancer cells include oxidative stress response reactive oxygen species and
nitric oxide, dna damage repair (base excision repair, homologous
recombination, non-homologous end-joining), various cell death modes (apoptosis, 
autophagy, ferroptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, oncosis), inhibition of
angiogenesis tumor-related signal transduction pathways (e.g. wnt/β-catenin
pathway, ampk pathway, metastatic pathways, others) signal transducers
(nf-κb, myc/max, ap-1, crebp, mtor etc). ars-type drugs stairways to
the clinics. several published case reports pilot phase i/ii trials indicate 
clinical anticancer activity compounds. unexpected cases of
hepatotoxicity, combinations ars-type drugs complementary alternative
medicines recommended, controlled clinical trials prove the
safety non-approved combination treatments.
