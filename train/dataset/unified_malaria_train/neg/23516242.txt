major histocompatibility complex (mhc) genes believed play key role in
the genetic basis disease control. although numerous studies sought links
between mhc disease prevalence, many ignored ecological and
epidemiological aspects host-parasite interaction. consequently,
interpreting associations prevalence mhc difficult, whereas 
discriminating alleles qualitative resistance, quantitative resistance and
susceptibility remains challenging. moreover, studies date have
quantified associations genotypes disease status, overlooking the
complex relationship genotype properties mhc molecule that
interacts parasites. here, address problems demonstrate avian
malaria (plasmodium) parasite species-specific associations functional
properties mhc molecules (mhc supertypes) wild great tit (parus major)
population. show correctly interpreting associations
depends crucially understanding spatial variation risk infection and
the fitness effects infection. report single mhc supertype confers
qualitative resistance plasmodium relictum, whereas different mhc supertype 
confers quantitative resistance plasmodium circumflexum infections.
furthermore, demonstrate common functional properties plasmodium-resistance
alleles passerine birds, suggesting model system parasite-mhc
associations wild.
