neutrophil extracellular traps (nets), composed primarily dna proteases,
are released activated neutrophils contribute innate immune
response capturing pathogens. plasmodium falciparum, causative agent of
severe malaria, thrives host counteracting immune elimination. here, we
report discovery novel virulence factor p. falciparum, tatd-like
dnase (pftatd) expressed primarily asexual blood stage is
likely utilized parasite counteract nets. pftatd exhibits typical
deoxyribonuclease activity, expression higher virulent parasites
than avirulent parasites. p. berghei tatd-knockout parasite displays reduced
pathogenicity mice. mice immunized recombinant tatd exhibit increased
immunity lethal challenge. results suggest tatd-like dnase
is essential factor survival malarial parasites host 
a potential malaria vaccine candidate.
