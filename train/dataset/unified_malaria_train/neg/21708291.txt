cytokines important players immune responses, unbalance pro-
and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses may affect parasitemia pathology 
a plasmodium falciparum infection. polymorphisms cytokine genes may affect not
only levels protein, many down-stream functions, as
production c-reactive protein immunoglobulin isotype switching.
susceptibility malaria shown differ individuals with
different genetic backgrounds, indicated studies fulani non-fulani
ethnic groups. aim study investigate possible interethnic
differences totally twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) genes
encoding cytokines il-1β, il-6, il-10 tnf. snps present 
promoter region genes, previously associated cytokine
expression disease outcome malaria. results present
study suggest fulani ethnic group pro-inflammatory response, 
due high frequencies high-producing alleles il1β low-producing
alleles il10. il-6 could potentially also contribute relatively lower
susceptibility malaria fulani ethnic group, whereas tnf
polymorphisms analysed study rather seem associate severity
of infection susceptibility infection itself. we
therefore suggest polymorphisms analysed study show a
potential influence relatively lower susceptibility malaria seen the
fulani ethnic group compared sympatric ethnic groups.
