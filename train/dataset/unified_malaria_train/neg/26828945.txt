eukaryotic armadillo (arm) repeat proteins multifaceted prominent roles 
in cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation intracellular signaling among 
many others. one arm repeat containing protein, arm repeats (aro), 
recently demonstrated toxoplasma (tgaro) plasmodium (pfaro)
parasites targeted rhoptries late asexual stages. tgaro
has implicated play important role rhoptry positioning i.e.
directing rhoptry towards apical end parasite. here, report for
the first time pfaro exhibits dna binding property dynamic
sub-cellular localization nucleus (early schizont) rhoptry (late 
schizont) different stages asexual blood-stage life cycle.
pfaro possesses putative nuclear export signal (nes) nucleo-apical
shuttling sensitive leptomycin b (lmb) suggesting nuclear export 
was mediated crm1. importantly, pfaro specifically bound a-t rich dna
sequence p. falciparum gyrase (pfgyra) gene, suggesting dna
binding specificity pfaro likely due at-richness probe. 
is novel functional characteristic reported previously for
any p. falciparum arm containing protein suggests putative role pfaro
in gene regulation. study describes first time conserved p.
falciparum arm repeat protein high degree functional versatility.
