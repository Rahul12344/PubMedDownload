as malaria pushed back many frontiers global case numbers are
declining, accurate measurement prediction transmission becomes
increasingly difficult. low transmission settings characterised high
levels spatial heterogeneity, stands stark contrast widely
used assumption spatially homogeneous transmission used mathematical
transmission models malaria. present study individual-based
mathematical malaria transmission model incorporates multiple parasite
clones, variable human exposure duration infection, limited mosquito
flight distance importantly geographically heterogeneous human and
mosquito population densities used illustrate differences between
homogeneous heterogeneous transmission assumptions aiming predict
surrogate indicators transmission intensity population parasite
prevalence multiplicity infection (moi). traditionally highly malaria
endemic regions population harbours malaria parasites, humans
are often infected multiple parasite clones. however, studies shown
also areas low overall parasite prevalence, infection multiple
parasite clones common occurrence. mathematical models assuming homogeneous 
transmission humans mosquitoes cannot explain observations.
heterogeneity transmission arise many factors including acquired
immunity, body size occupational exposure. study, show that
spatial heterogeneity profound effect predictions moi parasite
prevalence. illustrate, models assuming homogeneous transmission
underestimate average moi low transmission settings compared field
data spatially heterogeneous models predict stable transmission much 
lower overall parasite prevalence. therefore important models
used guide malaria surveillance control strategies low transmission and
elimination settings take account spatial features specific
target area, including human mosquito vector distribution.
