drug resistance p. falciparum recognized crucial obstacle
to curbing mortality morbidity malaria. therefore determined the
baseline distribution pfcrt pfmdr1 genes associated resistance to
chloroquine pfdhfr gene associated resistance pyrimethamine p.
falciparum isolates collected two geographically distinct areas nigeria. 
we use rt-pcr assays sequencing determine prevalence these
mutations. combined prevalence pfcrt t76 mutation two sites was
92.3% 86% osogbo compared 93% lafia. sequencing analysis the
(pfcrt) k76t haplotype (amino acids 72-76) revealed cviet resistance 
haplotype present two areas. frequency pfmdr1 polymorphisms was
higher lafia (39%) compared osogbo (35%) combined
prevalence two sites 45.5%. prevalence pfdhfr triple
mutant alleles high locations. osogbo vs lafia prevalence for
pfdhfr mutations 84% vs 91%, 88% vs 87% 96% vs 96% i51, r59 n108,
respectively. none samples two locations t108 mutation.
the combined prevalence pfcrt pfmdr1 osogbo lafia 44.2% 
risk ratio 0.4164 combined prevalence pfcrt, pfmdr1 pfdhfr
was 40.4% risk ratio 1.081. results strongly suggest the
widespread distribution cq pyrimethamine resistance without marked
distinction two locations.
