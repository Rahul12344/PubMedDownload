in recent years, substantial increase imported plasmodium
vivax incidence henan province. china pre-elimination phase, the
surveillance imported malaria essential, good way to
distinguish imported cases indigenous cases. paper reports case 
39-year-old man acquired p. vivax staying indonesia one month in
2013, relapsed henan, china 2014. diagnosed vivax malaria
based rapid diagnostic test, giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear and
plasmodium species-specific nested pcr. genetic sequence the
circumsporozoite protein genes analysed genetic variations were
compared previously constructed database chinese isolates. results 
from circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene sequence analysis centered the
repeat patterns showed imported cases completely different sequences
from subtypes chinese isolates, well matched countries
travelled patient. imported vivax cases able clearly
distinguish indigenous vivax cases detecting csp gene were
able confim origin genotyping.
