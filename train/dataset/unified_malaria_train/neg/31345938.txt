polymorphisms genetic copy number influence gene expression, coding
sequence, zygosity, making powerful actors evolutionary process. 
copy number variants (cnvs) however understudied, difficult to
detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms. take advantage intense
selective pressures major malaria vector anopheles gambiae, caused 
widespread use insecticides malaria control, investigate role of
cnvs evolution insecticide resistance. using whole-genome
sequencing data 1142 samples an. gambiae 1000 genomes project, we
identified 250 gene-containing cnvs, encompassing total 267 genes which
28 gene families linked metabolic insecticide resistance, representing
significant enrichment families. five major gene clusters for
metabolic resistance contained cnvs, 44 different cnvs found
across clusters multiple cnvs frequently covering genes. these
44 cnvs widespread (45% individuals carry least one them) have
been spreading positive selection, indicated high local
frequencies extended haplotype homozygosity. results demonstrate the
importance cnvs response selection, highlighting urgent need 
identify contribution cnv insecticide resistance track
their spread use insecticides malaria endemic countries intensifies 
and operational deployment next-generation bed nets targeting metabolic
resistance gathers pace. detailed descriptions cnvs found across the
species range provide tools so.
