only adult female mosquitoes feed blood, genders take sugar meals. 
accordingly, several compounds associated blood feeding (i.e. vasodilators, 
anti-clotting, anti-platelets) found female glands, enzymes
associated sugar feeding antimicrobials (such lysozyme) found in
the glands sexes. performed de novo assembly reads adult aedes
aegypti female male salivary gland libraries (285 90 million reads,
respectively). mapping back reads assembled contigs, plus mapping
the reads publicly available ae. aegypti library adult whole bodies, 
we identified 360 transcripts (including splice variants alleles)
overexpressed tenfold glands compared whole bodies.
moreover, among these, 207 overexpressed fivefold female vs. male
salivary glands, 85 near equally expressed 68 overexpressed male
glands. call particular attention c-type lectins, angiopoietins,
female-specific antigen 5, 9.7 kda, 12-14 kda, 23.5 kda, 62/34 kda, 4.2 kda, 
proline-rich peptide, sg8, 8.7 kda family sgs fragments: polypeptides
are unknown function, due overexpression female salivary
glands putative secretory nature expected affect host physiology.
we also found many transposons (some novel) several endogenous 
viral transcripts (probably acquired horizontal transfer) are
overexpressed salivary glands may play role tissue-specific
gene regulation represent mechanism virus interference. work
contributes near definitive catalog male female salivary gland
transcripts ae. aegypti, help direct studies aiming at
the functional characterization many transcripts unknown function and
the understanding role vector-host interaction pathogen
