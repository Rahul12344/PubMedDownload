background: plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 3α (pvmsp3α) a
promising vaccine candidate shown strong association with
immunogenicity protectiveness. use however complicated evolutionary
plasticity features enhance immune evasion. low complexity regions (lcrs)
provide plasticity surface proteins plasmodium species, implication
in vaccine design remain unexplored. population genetic, comparative
phylogenetic structural biology analysis performed gene encoding
pvmsp3α.
results: three lcrs found pvmsp3α block ii. predicted tertiary
structure protein phylogenetic trees based region were
influenced presence lcrs. lcrs mainly b cell epitopes
within adjacent. addition repeat motif mimicking one b cell
epitopes found within pvmsp3a block ii low complexity region. this
particular b cell epitope also featured rampant alanine substitutions might
impair antibody binding.
conclusion: findings indicate pvmsp3α block ii possesses lcrs which
might confer strong phenotypic plasticity. phenomenon phenotypic
plasticity implication lcrs malaria immunology general vaccine
candidate genes particular merits exploration.
