the evolution obligate parasitic lifestyle often associated genomic
reduction, particular loss functions associated increasing
host-dependence. evident many parasites, perhaps extreme 
transitions free-living autotrophic algae obligate parasites. the
best-known examples apicomplexans plasmodium, which
evolved algae red secondary plastids. however, analogous transition 
also took place independently helicosporidia, obligate parasite
of animals intracellular infection mechanism evolved algae with
green primary plastids. characterised nuclear genome helicosporidium to
compare transition parasitism apicomplexans. the
helicosporidium genome small compact, even comparison the
relatively small genomes closely related green algae chlorella and
coccomyxa, functional level find almost evidence reduction. 
nearly ancestral metabolic functions retained, single major
exception photosynthesis, even reduction complete. great
majority genes light-harvesting complexes, photosystems, pigment
biosynthesis lost, photosynthesis-related
functions, calvin cycle, retained. rather loss whole function
categories, predominant reductive force helicosporidium genome a
contraction gene family complexity, even losses affect families 
associated genome maintenance expression, functions associated 
host-dependence. gene families appear expanded response to
parasitism, particular chitinases, including predicted digest the
chitinous barriers insect host remodel cell wall of
helicosporidium. overall, helicosporidium genome presents fascinating
picture early stages transition free-living autotroph to
parasitic heterotroph host-independence unexpectedly preserved.
