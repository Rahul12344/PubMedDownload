as first line medicine malaria treatment, artesunate (art) also shows
antitumor potential. however, little known effect art the
cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt). study, found that
art inhibited cell growth sk-hep1 sm7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines. microarray used identify differentially expressed protein-coding 
rnas (pcrna) long noncoding rnas (lncrna) sk-hep1 cells and
without art treatment. differentially expressed lncrna-rp11, related
to emt liver cancer cells-rp11 identified abioinformatics method
overexpressing silencing assays used verify role rp11 in
cancer cell emt. levels rp11- emt-related genes liver cancer
samples 75 patients detected using qualitative polymerase chain
reaction immunohistochemistry. identified 1334 pcrnas 1670 lncrna 
differential expression induced art. art inhibits emt, proliferation,
migration, invasion, adhesion liver cancer cells. rp11 depresses the
inhibitory effect art cancer cell emt. level rp11 associated with
cancer cell emt metastasis survival rate patient. data
suggest rp11-linking art cancer cell emt important art-inhibited
metastasis liver cancer.
