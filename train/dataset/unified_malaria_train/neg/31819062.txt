novel interventions leverage heterogeneity parasite transmission 
needed achieve malaria elimination. better understand spatial temporal 
dynamics transmission, applied amplicon next-generation sequencing two
polymorphic gene regions (csp ama1) cohort identified via reactive case 
detection high-transmission setting western kenya. april 2013 to
july 2014, enrolled 442 symptomatic children malaria, 442 matched
controls, household members groups. here, evaluate genetic
similarity infected individuals using three indices: sharing parasite 
haplotypes binary proportional scales l1 norm. symptomatic
children commonly share haplotypes household members.
furthermore, observe robust temporal structuring parasite genetic
similarity identify unique molecular signature outbreak. these
findings micro- macro-scale organization parasite populations
might harnessed inform next-generation malaria control measures.
