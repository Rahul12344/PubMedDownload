background: plasmodium falciparum malaria significant problem around the
world today, thus still need new control methods developed. 
because sporozoite displays dual infectivity mosquito salivary
glands vertebrate host tissue, good target vaccine development.
methods: p. falciparum gene, pf11_0394, chosen candidate study
due potential role invasion host tissues. gene, was
selected using data mining approach plasmodb, expressed the
transcriptional protein levels sporozoites likely encodes putative
surface protein. using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
and green fluorescent protein (gfp)-trafficking studies, transcript protein
expression profile pf11_0394 determined.
results: pf11_0394 protein orthologs plasmodium species and
apicomplexans, none outside group apicomplexa. pf11_0394 transcript
was found present sporozoite erythrocytic stages the
parasite life cycle, transcript detected axenic exoerythrocytic
stages. despite presence transcript throughout several life cycle stages, 
the pf11_0394 protein detected salivary gland sporozoites.
conclusions: pf11_0394 appears protein uniquely detected salivary
gland sporozoites. even though specific function pf11_0394 been
determined p. falciparum biology, could another candidate new
vaccine.
