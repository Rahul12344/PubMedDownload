the role atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters conferring insecticide
resistance received much attention recently. identify abc
transporters differentially expressed insecticide-resistant populations the
malaria vector, anopheles gambiae. although found little evidence the
orthologues multidrug resistance proteins described species are
associated resistance an. gambiae identify subset abc
proteins consistently differentially expressed pyrethroid-resistant
populations across africa. present information phylogenetic
relationship, primary sites expression potential role abc transporters 
in mediating mosquito's response insecticides. furthermore demonstrate 
that paralogous group eight abcg transporters, clustered chromosome 3r,
are highly enriched legs an. gambiae mosquitoes, consistent a
proposed role abc subfamily transport lipids outer surface 
of cuticle. finally, antibodies raised one highly
expressed abc transporters adult females, abcg7 (agap009850), localized this
transporter pericardial cells. data help prioritize members 
this gene family localization functional validation studies to
identify vivo function transporters mosquito determine
whether elevated expression members family contribute insecticide
resistance.
