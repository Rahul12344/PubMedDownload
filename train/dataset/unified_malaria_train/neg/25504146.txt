in insects, abc transporters shown contribute defence/resistance 
to insecticides reducing toxic concentrations cells/tissues. despite the
extensive studies detoxifying mechanism, temporal patterns abc 
transporter activation poorly investigated. using malaria vector
anopheles stephensi study system, investigated expression profile 
abc genes belonging different subfamilies permethrin-treated larvae at
different time points (30 min 48 h). results showed expression of
abcb abcg subfamily genes upregulated 1 h treatment, the
highest expression observed 6 h. therefore, future investigations the
temporal dynamics abc gene expression allow better implementation of
insecticide treatment regimens, including use specific inhibitors abc
efflux pumps.
