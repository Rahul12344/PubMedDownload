background: plasmodium vivax prevalent cause human malaria in
tropical regions outside african continent. lack routine continuous 
in vitro culture parasite makes difficult develop specific drugs
for disease. facilitate development anti-p. vivax drugs, bacterial
and yeast surrogate models expressing validated p. vivax target dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) generated; however, can
only used primary screening models significant differences in
enzyme expression level vivo drug metabolism surrogate models 
and p. vivax parasites.
methods: plasmodium falciparum plasmodium berghei parasites transfected 
with dna constructs bearing p. vivax dhfr-ts pyrimethamine sensitive (wild-type) 
and pyrimethamine resistant (mutant) alleles. double crossover homologous
recombination used replace endogenous dhfr-ts p. falciparum p. 
berghei parasites p. vivax homologous genes. integration pvdhfr-ts
genes via allelic replacement verified southern analysis the
transgenic parasites lines validated models standard drug screening assays.
results: transgenic p. falciparum p. berghei lines stably expressing
pvdhfr-ts replacing endogenous parasite dhfr-ts obtained. anti-malarial 
drug screening assays showed transgenic parasites expressing wild-type
pvdhfr-ts pyrimethamine-sensitive, whereas transgenic parasites expressing
mutant pvdhfr-ts pyrimethamine-resistant. growth sensitivity to
other types anti-malarial drugs transgenic parasites otherwise
indistinguishable parental parasites.
conclusion: permanent integration pvdhfr-ts gene genome, the
transgenic plasmodium lines expressing pvdhfr-ts genetically stable 
be useful screening anti-p. vivax compounds targeting pvdhfr-ts. similar
approach could used generate transgenic models specific targets
of interest, thus facilitating development anti-p. vivax drugs general.
