through rapid genetic adaptation natural selection, plasmodium falciparum
parasite--the deadliest cause malaria--is able develop
resistance antimalarial drugs, thwarting present efforts control it.
genome-wide association studies (gwas) provide critical hypothesis-generating
tool understanding occurs. however, p. falciparum, limited
amount linkage disequilibrium hinders power traditional array-based
gwas. here, demonstrate feasibility power improvements gained using
whole-genome sequencing association studies. analyzed data 45
senegalese parasites identified genetic changes associated the
parasites' vitro response 12 different antimalarials. increase
statistical power, adapted common test natural selection, xp-ehh
(cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity), used identify
genomic regions associated resistance drugs. using sequence-based
approach combination association selection-based tests, we
detected several loci associated drug resistance. loci included the
previously known signals pfcrt, dhfr, pfmdr1, well many genes not
previously implicated drug-resistance roles, including genes the
ubiquitination pathway. based success analysis presented this
study, demonstrated shortcomings array-based approaches, argue
for complete transition sequence-based gwas small, low
linkage-disequilibrium genomes like p. falciparum.
