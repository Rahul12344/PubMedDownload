in recent report, cellular receptor cd55 identified molecule

hypothesized genetic variants gene could affect severe malaria (sm)
susceptibility. performed high-resolution variant discovery rare common
genetic variants human cd55 gene. association testing variants in
over 1700 sm cases unaffected control individuals malaria-endemic
ashanti region ghana, west africa, performed basis single
variants, combined rare variant analyses, reconstructed haplotypes. total
of 26 genetic variants detected coding regulatory regions cd55
five variants previously unknown. none single variants, rare

cd55 gene context sm show genetic variants present a
ghanaian study group appear influence susceptibility disease.
