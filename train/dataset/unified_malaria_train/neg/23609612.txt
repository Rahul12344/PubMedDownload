malaria one strongest selective pressures recent human evolution.
african populations continue risk malarial infections.
however, studies re-sequenced malaria susceptibility loci across
geographically genetically diverse groups africa. examined nucleotide
diversity intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), malaria susceptibility
candidate locus, number human populations specific focus on
diverse african ethnic groups. used tests neutrality assess whether
natural selection impacted locus tested whether snp variation at
icam-1 correlated malaria endemicity. observe differing patterns of
nucleotide haplotype variation global populations higher levels of
diversity africa. although observe deviation neutrality based
on allele frequency distribution, observe several alleles icam-1,
including icam-1 (kilifi) allele, correlated malaria
endemicity. show icam-1 (kilifi) allele, common africa
and asia, exists distinct haplotype backgrounds likely arisen
more recently asia. results suggest correlation analyses allele
frequencies malaria endemicity may useful identifying candidate
functional variants play role malaria resistance susceptibility.
