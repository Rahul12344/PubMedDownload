objective: determine distribution duffy blood group genotypes in
balouch population major ethnic group living sub-tropical area 
south east iran.
methods: study, duffy blood group fy phenotypes determined using
indirect anti-globulin technique also genotype pcr-rflp 160 vivax
malaria patients 160 control individuals.
results: results showed common duffy genotype fya/fyb
(46.6%) followed fya/fya (15.3%), fya/fyo (14.4%), fyb/fyo (11.9%), fyb/fyb
(10%) fyo/fyo (1.9%). case individuals, frequency fya, fyb fyo
alleles 0.471, 0.431 0.097, respectively compaired 0.444, 0.353 and
0.203, respectively control (non-infected) group.
conclusions: data provide evidence individuals fya/fyb
genotype higher susceptibility malaria significant
associations duffy blood group variants susceptibility resistance 
to vivax malaria.
