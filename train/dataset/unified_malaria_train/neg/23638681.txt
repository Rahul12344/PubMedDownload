the advent techniques study palmitoylation whole proteome scale has
revealed important reversible modification plays role in
regulating multiple biological processes. palmitoylation control affinity
of protein lipid membranes, allows impact protein trafficking, 
stability, folding, signalling interactions. publication palmitome
of schizont stage plasmodium falciparum implicated role for
palmitoylation host cell invasion, protein export organelle biogenesis.
however, nothing known far repertoire protein s-acyl
transferases (pats) catalyse modification apicomplexa. undertook 
a comprehensive analysis repertoire asp-his-his-cys cysteine-rich
domain (dhhc-crd) pat family toxoplasma gondii plasmodium berghei by
assessing localization essentiality. unlike functional redundancies
reported eukaryotes, apicomplexan-specific dhhcs essential 
parasite growth, several targeted organelles unique phylum. of
particular interest dhhc7, localizes rhoptry organelles all
parasites tested, including major human pathogen p. falciparum. tgdhhc7
interferes localization rhoptry palmitoylated protein tgaro and
affects apical positioning rhoptry organelles. pat major
impact t. gondii host cell invasion, parasite's ability to
egress.
