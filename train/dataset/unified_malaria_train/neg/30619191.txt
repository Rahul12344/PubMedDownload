plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1, encoded var gene, 
immunodominant antigen mediating immune evasion humans. given time, 
a single var gene commonly expressed one parasite. however, regulation 
mechanism var transcription remains largely unknown. study, we
identified antisense long non-coding rna (aslncrna) derived var intron
as activation factor corresponding var gene. exogenous artificial 
var aslncrna transcribed t7 rna polymerase episome specifically
activate homologous var gene, exogenous aslncrna activates
transcription var mrna endogenous aslncrna manner independent of
the conserved intron sequence within var gene family. interestingly, the
newly activated var gene previously dominant var gene could be
co-expressed parasite nuclei, suggests the
aslncrna-mediated var gene activation could escape control mutually
exclusively expression var gene family. together, work shows var 
aslncrna activator responsible var gene transcriptional regulation.
