background: g6pd enzyme deficiency common enzymatic x-linked disorder.
deficiency g6pd enzyme cause free radical-mediated oxidative damage to
red blood cells, leading premature haemolysis. treatment plasmodium vivax
malaria primaquine poses potential risk mild severe acute haemolytic
anaemia g6pd deficient people. study, prevalence distribution 
of g6pd mutations investigated across broad areas ethiopia, tested
the association g6pd genotype phenotype goal provide
additional information relevant use primaquine malaria treatment.
methods: study examined g6pd mutations exons 3-11 344 febrile patient
samples collected seven sites across ethiopia. addition, g6pd enzyme 
level 400 febrile patient samples southwestern ethiopia determined by
the carestartâ„¢ biosensor. association g6pd phenotype genotype was
examined fisher exact test subset 184 samples.
results: mutations observed three positions g6pd gene. most
common g6pd mutation across sites a376g, detected 21 344 
(6.1%) febrile patients. thirteen homozygous eight were
heterozygous mutation. g267+119c/t mutation found 4 (1.2%)
individuals south ethiopia, absent sites. g1116a mutation was
also found 4 (1.2%) individuals east south ethiopia. 400
samples south, 17 (4.25%) shown g6pd-deficient. g6pd enzyme
level significantly different age gender. among subset 202
febrile patients diagnosed malaria, 11 (5.45%) g6pd-deficient.
these 11 infected samples diagnosed plasmodium vivax microscopy.
parasitaemia significantly different g6pd-deficient and
g6pd-normal infections.
conclusions: prevalence g6pd deficiency modest among febrile patients
in ethiopia. g6pd deficiency testing thus recommended administrating
primaquine radical cure p. vivax infected patients. present study 
not indicate significant association g6pd gene mutations enzyme
levels.
