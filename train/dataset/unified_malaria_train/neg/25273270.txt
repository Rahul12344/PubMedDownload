parasites still impose high death disability burden human populations,
and therefore likely act selective factors genetic adaptations.
genetic epidemiological investigation parasitic diseases aimed at
disentangling mechanisms underlying immunity pathogenesis looking 
associations linkages loci susceptibility phenotypes. until
recently, studies used candidate gene approach relatively
underpowered, attempts replicating findings different populations.
however, last 5 years, genome-wide and/or multicentre studies been
conducted severe malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, cardiac chagas disease,
providing novel important insights. furthermore, studies helminth
infections repeatedly shown involvement common loci regulating
susceptibility distinct diseases schistosomiasis, ascariasis,
trichuriasis, onchocherciasis. studies conducted, evidence is
increasing least identified susceptibility loci shared
not among parasitic diseases also immunological disorders as
allergy autoimmune disease, suggesting parasites may played role
in driving evolution immune system.
