we define neurodevelopment dynamic inter-relationship genetic,
brain, cognitive, emotional behavioural processes across developmental
lifespan. significant persistent disruption dynamic process through
environmental genetic risk lead neurodevelopmental disorders and
disability. research designed ameliorate neurodevelopmental disorders low- 
and middle-income countries, well globally, benefit enormously from
the ongoing advances understanding genetic epigenetic causes, as
modified environment culture. provide examples advances the
prevention treatment of, rehabilitation with,
neurodevelopment disorders low- middle-income countries, along with
opportunities strategic research initiatives. examples not
the possibilities strategic research, illustrate problems that,
when solved, could considerable impact low-resource settings. each
instance, research low- middle-income countries led innovations in
identification, surveillance treatment neurodevelopmental disorder.
these innovations also integrated genotypic mapping of
neurodevelopmental disorders, forming important preventative rehabilitative
interventions potential high impact. advances ultimately 
allow us understand epigenetic influences shape neurodevelopmental risk
and resilience time across populations. clearly, strategic
areas research opportunity involve cross-disciplinary integration the
intersection environment, brain behaviour neurodevelopment, and
genetic epigenetic science. junctions robust integrative
cross-disciplinary scientific approach catalysing creation technologies
and interventions old problems. approaches enable us achieve and
sustain united nations moral legal mandate child health full
