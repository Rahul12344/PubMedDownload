objective: determine expression pfg377 ortholog gene plasmodium
vivax, examine correlation mosquito infection.
methods: seventy clinical blood samples positive p. vivax microscopy, were
used mosquito infectivity assay. infectivity female anopheles dirus
was determined oocyst counts. transcripts pfg377 ortholog gene p. 
vivax blood samples infective non-infective mosquitoes examined 
using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr).
results: 70 p. vivax positive blood samples, 50 (71.4%) samples were
mosquito-infective 20 (28.6%) not. infective samples, expression 
level pfg377 ortholog gene significantly higher non-infective 
group (p<0.05). infective samples, expression level pfg377 ortholog
gene ≥100 copies/ml blood cut-off point correlated ≥10
oocysts/mosquito cut-off point average oocyst numbers ≥50% cut-off
point per cent infected mosquitoes (pearson's chi-square correlation, p=0.014 
and p=0.026, respectively).
conclusion: cut-off point expression level pfg377 ortholog gene
could used predict infectiousness p. vivax gametocytes leading to
mosquito infection parasite transmission field.
