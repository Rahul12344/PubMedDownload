in competition hosts, parasites antigens novel the

frequency-dependent selection structure parasite populations strains 
limited genetic overlap. causative agent malaria, plasmodium
falciparum, high recombination rates associated vast diversity its
highly antigenic multicopy var genes preclude clear clustering in
endemic regions. undermines definition strains specific,
temporally persisting gene variant combinations. use temporal multilayer
networks analyze genetic similarity parasites simulated data

over time, populations structured modules (i.e., groups) parasite
genomes whose var gene combinations similar within the
modules whose persistence much longer individual genomes 
that compose them. comparison neutral models retain parasite population

promotes persistence modules. modular structure is, turn,
associated slower acquisition immunity individual hosts. modules
thus represent dynamically generated niches host immune space, be

the organization var diversity parasite genomes, leaving a
persistence signature ecological time scales. multilayer networks extend the
