the interplay cellular molecular determinants lead severe
malaria adults unexplored. here, analyzed parasite virulence factors 
an infected adult population india investigated whether severe malaria
isolates impair endothelial protein c receptor (epcr), protein involved in
coagulation endothelial barrier permeability. severe malaria isolates
overexpressed specific members plasmodium falciparum var gene/pfemp1 (p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) family bind epcr, including dc8
var genes previously linked severe pediatric malaria. machine
learning analysis revealed dc6- dc8-encoding var transcripts in
combination high parasite biomass strongest indicators patient
hospitalization disease severity. found dc8 cidrÎ±1 domains from
severe malaria isolates substantial differences epcr binding affinity 
blockade activity ligand activated protein c. additionally, even low
level inhibition exhibited domains two cerebral malaria isolates was
sufficient interfere activated protein c-barrier protective activities in
human brain endothelial cells. findings demonstrate interplay between
parasite biomass specific pfemp1 adhesion types development adult
severe malaria, indicate low impairment epcr function may contribute 
to parasite virulence.
