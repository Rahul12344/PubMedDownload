endemic burkitt lymphoma (ebl) aggressive b cell lymphoma associated
with epstein-barr virus (ebv) plasmodium falciparum malaria co-infections.
central bl oncogenesis over-expression myc proto-oncogene 
is caused translocation ig enhancer approximation myc gene. 
while whole genome/transcriptome sequencing methods used define
driver mutations transcriptional dysregulation, microrna (mirna)
dysregulation differential expression yet fully characterized. we
hypothesized human ebv mirnas contribute ebl clinical
presentation, disease progression, poor outcomes. using sensitive precise
deep sequencing, identified mirnas 17 kenyan ebl patient tumor samples
and delineated complement host ebv mirnas. one human mirna,
hsa-mir-10a-5p found differentially expressed (de), being
down-regulated jaw tumors relative abdominal non-survivors compared 
to survivors. also examined ebv mirnas, made 2.7% mirna
composition ebl samples. however, find significant
associations regarding initial patient outcome anatomical presentation. gene
ontology analysis pathway enrichment previously validated targets of
mir-10a-5p suggest promote tumor cell survival well aid in
evasion apoptosis. examine mir-10a-5p regulatory effect gene expression 
in ebl, performed pairwise correlation coefficient analysis the
expression levels validated targets. found significant enrichment
of correlated target genes consistent mir-10a-5p impacting expression. the
functions genes correlation fit multiple target genes impacting
tumor resilience. observed downregulation mir-10a associated genes
suggests role mirna ebl patient outcomes potential a
predictive biomarker warrants investigation.
