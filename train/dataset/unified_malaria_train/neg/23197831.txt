plasmodium falciparum causes deadliest form human malaria. virulence
is attributed ability modify infected rbc evade human immune
attack antigenic variation. antigenic variation achieved tight
regulation antigenic switches variable surface antigens named "p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1" encoded var multicopy gene
family. individual parasites express single var gene time,
maintaining remaining var genes transcriptionally silent state. strict
pairing var gene promoters second promoter within intron found
in var gene required silencing counting var genes the
mechanism controls mutually exclusive expression. identified and
characterized insulator-like dna elements required pairing var
promoters introns thus essential regulating silencing and
mutually exclusive expression. elements, found regulatory regions of
each var gene, bound distinct nuclear protein complexes. alteration in
the specific, paired structure elements either deletion insertion 
of additional elements results unregulated var gene. propose model 
which silencing mutually exclusive expression var genes regulated by
the precise arrangement insulator-like dna pairing elements.
