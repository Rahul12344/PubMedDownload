background: 2005, democratic republic congo (drc) switched to
artesunate/amodiaquine first-line antimalarial response increasing
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance adopted intermittent preventive
treatment using sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine pregnancy.
objectives: determine prevalence molecular markers of
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance southwestern drc 10 years new
policy instituted.
methods: march 2014 december 2015, blood samples collected from
symptomatic patients presenting outpatient centres urban rural areas. a
total 2030 confirmed plasmodium falciparum isolates genotyped codons
associated sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance.
results: prevalence pfdhfr-n51i, c59r s108n pfdhps-a437g mutations
was consistently high; prevalence pfdhps-k540e mutation low but
increased since first report 2008 region, reaching 17.6% by
2015. pfdhps-a581g mutation increased ∼4.5% 2014 ∼14.0% 2015 at
urban sites rural areas remained low (∼4.0%). mutations
pfdhfr-i164l pfdhps-a613s detected first time drc. also, 11
(0.8%) isolates revealed presence newly described pfdhps-i431v
mutation. combining pfdhfr pfdhps alleles, quintuple sextuple mutations
were observed, emergence septuple (irni/iagega)- octuple
(irni/vagkgs)-mutant genotypes.
conclusions: intermittent preventive treatment using sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
during pregnancy remains warranted southwestern drc. however, expansion of
pfdhps-k540e mutation emergence mutants cause higher levels of
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance concerning may present challenge
for future preventive interventions country.
