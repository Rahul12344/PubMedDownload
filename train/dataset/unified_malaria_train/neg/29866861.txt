hsp90 inhibitors, well studied laboratory clinic antitumor
indications, promising activity protozoan pathogens, including
trypanosoma brucei causes african sleeping sickness, malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum progress experimental drugs toward
clinical use, adapted vitro dynamic hollow-fiber system deployed
artificial pharmacokinetics discover driver activity: either
concentration time. activities compounds three major classes of
hsp90 inhibitors development evaluated trypanosomes. all
circumstances, activities tested hsp90 inhibitors concentration
driven. optimally deploying drug match kinetic driver, efficacy
of given dose improved 5-fold, maximal efficacy achieved with
a significantly lower drug exposure. superiority concentration-driven
regimens evident vitro several logs drug exposure was
predictive efficacy mouse model african trypanosomiasis. studies
with p. falciparum, antimalarial activity similarly concentration driven.
this experimental strategy offers expedient versatile translational tool
to assess impact pharmacokinetics antiprotozoal activity. knowing
kinetic governance early drug development provides additional metric for
judging lead compounds allows incisive design animal efficacy studies.
