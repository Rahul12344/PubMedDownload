this study undertaken ascertain extent polymorphism the
c-terminal region plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein (msp-1) from
119 malaria patients tak province western border thailand, 
admitted bangkok hospital tropical diseases, faculty tropical
medicine, mahidol university, bangkok, thailand. p. falciparum infection was
confirmed microscopic examination peripheral blood smears. clinical
manifestations categorized 2 groups: uncomplicated (94 cases) and
complicated/severe (25 cases). 1,040 basepair fragment p. falciparum msp-1
gene compared msp-1 reference strains retrieved genbank. the
consensus sequences msp-1 block 16 showed belonged mad20 genotype, which
is major allele falciparum malaria western border thailand.
msp-1 block 16 amino acid fragment could separated 2 groups: similar 
dissimilar reference sequence. four variations msp-1 block 16 -1494k, 
d1510g, d1556n, k1696i. msp-1 block 16 diversity significantly
associated clinical manifestation although mad 20 genotype the
predominant genotype area. genetic data msp1 gene faciparum
malaria isolated western thai border contribute existing genetic
database thai p. falciparum strain.
