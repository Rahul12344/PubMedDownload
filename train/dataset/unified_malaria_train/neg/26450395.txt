we describe methods rapid generation transgenic rodent plasmodium
berghei (pb) parasites express human malaria parasite (hmp) proteins, using 
the recently developed gimo-based transfection methodology. three different
genetic modifications described resulting three types transgenic
parasites. (1) additional gene (ag) mutants. mutants hmp gene is
introduced "additional gene" silent/neutral locus pb genome
under control either constitutive stage-specific pb promoter. this
method uses gimo-transfection protocol ag mutants generated by
replacing positive-negative selection marker (sm) hdhfr::yfcu cassette a
neutral locus standard gimo mother line hmp gene expression
cassette, resulting sm free transgenic parasites. (2) double-step replacement 
(dsr) mutants. mutants coding sequence (cds) pb gene is
replaced cds hmp ortholog two-step gimo-transfection
procedure. process involves first replacement pb cds the
hdhfr::yfcu sm, followed insertion hmp ortholog locus
thereby replacing hdhfr::yfcu hmp cds. steps use the
gimo-transfection protocol, exploits positive selection pb
orthologous gene-deletion negative selection hmp gene-insertion,
resulting sm free transgenic parasites. (3) double-step insertion (dsi)
mutants. pb gene essential blood stage development dsr strategy
is possible. mutants hmp expression cassette first introduced
into neutral locus standard gimo mother line described ag mutants
but control elements pb orthologous gene; subsequently, pb
ortholog cds targeted deletion replacement pb cds 
hdhfr::yfcu sm, resulting transgenic parasites new gimo locus
permissive additional gene-insertion modifications.the different types of
transgenic parasites exploited examine interactions drugs/inhibitors
or immune factors hmp molecules vivo. mice either immunized with
hmp-vaccines treated specific drugs infected/challenged these
transgenic mutants evaluate drug vaccine efficacy vivo.
