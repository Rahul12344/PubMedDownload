chloroquine (cq) antimalarial drug elicits severe pruritus black
africans malaria fever. acute itching (2-7 days duration) exhibits age 
dependency racial genetic predilection. cq itch non-histaminergic,
which makes good model tool probe mechanisms chronic
itch. review focuses recently discovered mechanisms, neuroscience,
mediators, receptors implicated molecular studies cq pruritus.
cq pruritus mechanisms also compared itching following other
systemic diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, skin
disorders, burns. striking similarities cq itching pathways
and chronic itch secondary systemic disease without skin
lesions, previously highlighted. prominent among are
the shared roles skin, neural spinal μ opiate receptors, kappa opiate
receptor, nitric oxide, serotonin via 5ht1b/d receptors, cytokines, especially
interleukins, tumor necrosis factor. elaborate "cross talk" among
the diverse mediators receptors involved cq-induced pruritus. cq also
binds mas-related g protein coupled receptors mrgpra3/mrgprx1 present a
small proportion (4-5%) dorsal root ganglion neurons skin. mrgpra3 cq 
receptors coupled plc-β3 chloride channel initiate skin itch
action potentials c nerve fibers. mrgpra3/x1 couples trpa1 calcium
influx neuronal cells noncutaneous sites. central cq itch occurs via
gastrin-related peptide (grp) receptor (grpr) dorsal spinothalamic
tracts, well glutamic mediated grp projection parabrachial nucleus. 
possibility chronic itch therapy based personalized medicine, genetics, and
transcriptomics use itch "polypill/polycream" discussed.
