killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kirs) group natural killer
cell receptors (nkrs) regulate nk-cell-mediated production interferon
gamma (ifn-γ) response infection. receptors recently been
suggested influence severity clinical plasmodium falciparum malaria
infection. examined kir locus relation malaria children from
southwest nigeria. sequence specific priming (ssp)-pcr used detect kir
genes. presence absence fifteen different kir genes determined in
each individual proportions compared across 3 clinical groups;
asymptomatic malaria, uncomplicated clinical malaria severe clinical malaria.
the genes kir2dl5, kir2ds3 kir2ds5 present significantly higher
proportion individuals asymptomatic control group malaria
cases. furthermore, kir2ds3 kir2ds5 present higher proportion of
uncomplicated malaria cases severe malaria cases. carriage c-ab2 genotype
(which comprises centromeric kir genes including kir2dl5, kir2ds3 and
kir2ds5) decreases severity disease suggesting kir ab
profile might associated protection severe malaria infection this
population nigeria.
