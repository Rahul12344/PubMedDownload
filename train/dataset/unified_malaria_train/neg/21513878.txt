pactamycin, one densely functionalized aminocyclitol antibiotics, has
pronounced antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, antiplasmodial activities,
but development clinical drug hampered broad cytotoxicity.
efforts modulate biological activity structural modifications using
synthetic organic chemistry difficult complexity 
chemical structure. however, extensive biosynthetic studies genetic
engineering, able produce analogs pactamycin show potent
antimalarial activity, lack significant antibacterial activity, about
10-30 times less toxic pactamycin toward mammalian cells. results
suggest distinct ribosomal binding selectivity new mechanism(s) action
may involved plasmodial growth inhibition, may lead the
discovery new antimalarial drugs identification new molecular targets
within malarial parasites.
