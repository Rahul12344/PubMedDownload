background: use gene drive systems manipulate populations malaria
vectors currently investigated method malaria control. one
potential system uses driving endonuclease genes (degs) spread genes that
impose genetic load. previously, models shown introduction of
deg-bearing mosquitoes could suppress even extinguish vector populations in
spatially-heterogeneous environments constant time. this
study, stochastic spatially-explicit model mosquito ecologyÂ is combined with
a rainfall model enables generation variety daily precipitation
patterns. model used investigate releases deg cause 
a bias population sex ratios towards males affected seasonal random 
rainfall patterns. parameters rainfall model fitted using
data bamako, mali, mbita, kenya, evaluate release strategies in
similar climatic conditions.
results: landscapes abundant resources large mosquito populations the
spread deg reliable, irrespective variability rainfall. study 
thus focuses mainly landscapes low density mosquito populations the
spread deg may sensitive variation rainfall. found an
introduced deg spread target population reliably wet
conditions, yet established deg impact dry conditions. in
strongly seasonal environments, thus preferable release degs the
onset wet season maximize spread following dry season.
if variability rainfall substantial random component, net
increase probability deg release lead population
extinction, due increased impact deg manages establish in
these conditions. bamako, annual rainfall patterns characterized by
a long dry season, optimal release deg start wet season,
where population growing fastest. contrast release timing lower
importance less seasonal mbita.
conclusion: analysis suggests deg based methods malaria vector
control effective wide range climates. environments with
substantial temporal variation rainfall, careful timing releases which
accounts temporal variation population density substantially
improve probability mosquito suppression extinction.
