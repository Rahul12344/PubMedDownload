background: gabon, vector transmission poorly studied. since the
implementation roll back malaria recommendations, clinical studies have
shown decline burden malaria libreville, capital city of
gabon. better understand transmission dynamic libreville, an
entomological survey conducted five districts city.
methods: mosquitoes sampled human landing collection 1 year in
five districts libreville: alibandeng, beauséjour, camp des boys sotega.
mosquitoes identified morphologically molecular methods. the
plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoïte indices measured elisa, the
entomological inoculation rates (eir) calculated areas. molecular
assessments pyrethroid knock resistance (kdr) insensitive
acetylcholinesterase resistance conducted.
results: total 57,531 mosquitoes caught 341 person-nights (161
person-nights indoor 180 person-nights outdoor) among which, 4,223 were
anopheles gambiae s.l. average human biting rate fell 15.5 bites per
person rainy season 4.7 dry season. an. gambiae
complex population composed an. gambiae s.s molecular form (99.5%),
anopheles melas (0.3%) an. gambiae s.s. form (0.2%). thirty-three of
4,223 an. gambiae s.l. found infected p. falciparum (csp index =
0.78%). annual eir estimated 33.9 infected bites per person per year
ranging 13 alibandeng 88 sotega. insensitive ache mutation was
identified kdr-w kdr-e mutations present an. gambiae
molecular form higher frequency kdr-w allele (76%) kdr-e
allele (23.5%).
conclusion: malaria transmission libreville occurred mainly rainy
season also dry season five districts. transmission level
is high seems heterogeneous town. interestingly, the
highest eir recorded central urbanized quarter lowest
in peripheral area. decrease transmission usually seen peri-urban
areas urban centers probably dependent socio-economic level 
a quarter location city. urban malaria control programmes need
to consider socio economic level area rather location the
city order determine areas favourable malaria transmission.
