a challenge studying diverse multi-copy gene families deciphering distinct 
functional types within immense sequence variation. functional changes in
some cases tracked evolutionary history gene family; however 
phylogenetic approaches possible cases gene families diversify
primarily recombination. take network theoretical approach to
functionally classify highly recombining var antigenic gene family the
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. sample var dblÎ± sequence types 
local population ghana, classify 9,276 variants 48
functional types. approach first decompose sequence type 
constituent, recombining parts; use stochastic block model identify 
functional groups among parts; finally, classify sequence types based 
on functional groups contain. method functional
classification rely inferred phylogenetic history, it
rely inferring function based conserved sequence features. instead, it
infers functional similarity among recombining parts based sharing of
similar co-occurrence interactions parts. method therefore
group sequences undetectable sequence homology even distinct
origination. describing 48 var functional types allows us simplify the
antigenic diversity within dataset two orders magnitude. we
consider var functional types distributed isolates, find a
nonrandom pattern reflecting common var functional types non-randomly
distinct one another terms functional composition. the
coarse-graining var gene diversity biologically meaningful functional
groups important implications understanding disease ecology and
evolution system, well designing effective epidemiological
monitoring intervention.
