despite considerable success genome wide association (gwa) studies in
identifying causal variants many human diseases, success unraveling 
the genetic basis complex diseases mitigated. pathogen
population structure may impact upon infectious phenotype, especially with
the intense short-term selective pressure drug treatment exerts on
pathogens. rigorous analysis accounts repeated measures disentangles
the influence genetic environmental factors must performed. attempts
should made consider whether pathogen diversity impact upon host
genetic responses infection.we analyzed heritability two plasmodium
falciparum phenotypes, number clinical malaria episodes (pfa) the
proportion episodes positive gametocytes (pfgam), family-based 
cohort followed 19 years, time four successive drug
treatment regimes, documented appearance drug resistance. repeated
measures variance components analyses performed fixed
environmental, additive genetic, intra-individual maternal effects each

more detailed gwa studies. temporal changes individual genetic the

malaria parasite infection likely includes dominance/epistatic genetic effects
