mutations glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) gene result red
blood cells increased susceptibility oxidative damage. significant
haemolysis caused primaquine 8-aminoquinoline antimalarials
used radical treatment plasmodium vivax malaria. distribution 
phenotypes mutations causing g6pd deficiency male population of
migrants refugees malaria endemic region thailand-myanmar border 
were characterized. blood samples g6pd fluorescent spot test (fst), g6pd
genotyping, malaria testing taken 504 unrelated males karen 
burman ethnicities presenting outpatient clinics. overall frequency of
g6pd deficiency fst 13.7%. among deficient subjects, almost 90%
had mahidol variant (487g>a) genotype. remaining subjects chinese-4
(392g>t), viangchan (871g>a), aÃ§ores (595a>g), seattle (844g>c) mediterranean
(563c>t) variants. quantification g6pd activity performed using a
modification standard spectrophotometric assay subset 24 samples
with mahidol, viangchan, seattle chinese-4 mutations; samples showed a
residual enzymatic activity 10% normal diagnosed correctly by
the fst. studies needed characterise haemolytic risk using 
8-aminoquinolines patients genotypes.
