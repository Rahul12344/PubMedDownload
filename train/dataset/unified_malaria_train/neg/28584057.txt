persistent chronic infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) represents one
of common viral diseases humans. hepatitis b virus deploys the
hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) suppressor host defenses consisting 
rnai-based silencing viral genes. critical role countering
host defenses, hbx represents attractive target antiviral drugs. here, 
developed optimized loss-of-function screening procedure, identified 
a potential pharmacophore abrogated hbx rnai suppression activity. a
survey 14,400 compounds maybridge screening collection, prioritized 
candidate compounds via high-throughput screening based reversal green
fluorescent protein (gfp)-reported, rnai-mediated silencing hepg2/gfp-shrna 
rnai sensor line. screening yielded pharmacologically active compound,
n-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-n'-[3-(1h-imidazol-1-yl) propyl] thiourea (ir415), which
blocked hbx-mediated rnai suppression indicated gfp reporter assay. we
also found ir415 reversed inhibitory effect hbx protein activity
of dicer endoribonuclease. confirmed results primary
screen ir415-treated, hbv-infected hepg2 cells, exhibited marked
depletion hbv core protein synthesis down-regulation pre-genomic hbv
rna. using molecular interaction analysis system, confirmed ir415
selectively targets hbx concentration-dependent manner. screening assay 
presented allows rapid improved detection small-molecule inhibitors
of hbx related viral proteins. assay may therefore potentiate the
development next-generation rnai pathway-based therapeutics promises to
accelerate search novel effective drugs antiviral research.
