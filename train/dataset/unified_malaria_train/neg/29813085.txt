background: world health organization currently recommends artemisinin (along
with partner drug) global frontline treatment plasmodium falciparum 
malaria. artemisinin resistant p. falciparum found throughout greater
mekong subregion south east asia. several polymorphisms parasite's
kelch gene demonstrated confer artemisinin resistance. while
genotypes within greater mekong subregion thoroughly examined the
literature, p. falciparum populations within several areas (yet) have
endemic resistance underrepresented.
results: investigation characterised pfkelch13 propeller domains from
153 blood samples 140 imported cases p. falciparum malaria new south
wales 2010 2016. low level propeller domain diversity observed, 
including c580y coding mutation strongly associated artemisinin
resistance south east asia. resistance genotype found sample
originating papua new guinea, mutation, artemisinin treatment
failure, previously reported. sequencing panel geographically 
informative polymorphisms within organellar genomes identified c580y
parasite oceanic origins. patient data analysis revealed new south
wales, australia, p. falciparum malaria cases often originated regions 
limited drug resistance screening.
conclusions: c580y finding outside greater mekong subregion
supports consensus upscale molecular surveillance artemisinin
resistance outside south east asia. genetic screening results identify a
risk importing resistant falciparum malaria australia, supporting an
ongoing surveillance protocol pre-empt treatment failure contribute to
global data gathering.
