plasmodium falciparum like organisms dependent polyamines for
proliferation. polyamine biosynthesis parasites regulated unique
bifunctional s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase/ornithine decarboxylase
(pfadometdc/odc). limited biochemical structural information is
available bifunctional enzyme due low levels impurity an
instable recombinantly expressed protein native gene. describe
the high level expression stable monofunctional pfadometdc a
codon-harmonised construct, permitted biochemical characterisation
indicating similar catalytic properties adometdcs orthologous parasites. in
the absence structural data, far-uv cd showed least secondary
structure level, pfadometdc corresponds well human protein. the
kinetic properties monofunctional enzyme also found different
from pfadometdc/odc mainly evidenced increased k(m). deduced 
that complex formation pfadometdc pfodc could enable coordinated
modulation decarboxylase activities since convergence 
k(cat) lowering k(m). coordination results aligned
production decarboxylated adomet putrescine subsequent synthesis
of spermidine. furthermore, based results obtained study we
propose new adometdc subclass plasmodial adometdcs.
