studies vertebrate immunity traditionally focused professional cells, 
including circulating tissue-resident leukocytes. evidence that
non-professional cells also intrinsically essential (i.e. via their
effect leukocytes) protective immunity natural conditions infection 
has emerged three lines research human genetics. first, studies of
mendelian resistance infection revealed essential role of
darc-expressing erythrocytes protection plasmodium vivax infection,
and essential role fut2-expressing intestinal epithelial cells for
protection norovirus rotavirus infections. second, studies inborn 
errors non-hematopoietic cell-extrinsic immunity shown apol1 and
complement cascade components secreted hepatocytes essential for
protective immunity trypanosome pyogenic bacteria, respectively. third,
studies inborn errors non-hematopoietic cell-intrinsic immunity have
suggested keratinocytes, pulmonary epithelial cells, cortical neurons
are essential tissue-specific protective immunity human papillomaviruses, 
influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, respectively. various types of
genetic resistance predisposition infection human populations not
readily explained inborn variants genes operating leukocytes may,
therefore, involve defects cells. probing unchartered
territory human genetics reshaping immunology, scaling immunity to
infection immune system whole organism.
