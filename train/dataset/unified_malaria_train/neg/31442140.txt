detoxifying pathways mosquitoes neem (azadirachta indica) extracts
are still unclear. aim present study investigate role of
adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (abc) transporters process in
anopheles stephensi, one main malaria vectors southern asia.
third-stage larvae an. stephensi fed fish food alone in
combination neem extract 0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%. six abc-transporter genes
from 3 different subfamilies (b, c, g) analyzed assess relative
expression compared controls. bioassay also performed assess larval
mortality rate different concentrations combination verapamil, 
abc-transporter inhibitor. significant variation expression levels of
any transporter belonging b, c, g subfamilies detected.
furthermore, use verapamil induce increase mortality 
of tested neem extract concentrations, indicating abc transporters are
not involved detoxification neem extracts an. stephensi larvae.
