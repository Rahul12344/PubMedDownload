there increased interest potential zoonotic malarias. date,
plasmodium malariae infects humans remains indistinguishable plasmodium
brasilianum, widespread among new world primates. distributed throughout
tropical central south america, callitrichidae small arboreal
primates detection natural plasmodium infection extremely
rare. prior screening efforts limited small samples, use of
low-probability detection methods, both. rarely screening efforts
implemented longitudinal sampling design. annual mark-recapture
program two sympatric callitrichids, emperor (saguinus imperator) and
saddleback (saguinus fuscicollis) tamarins, whole blood samples screened for
plasmodium microscopy nested pcr cytochrome b gene across four
consecutive years (2012-2015). following first field season, approximately
50% samples collected subsequent year recaptured
individuals. particular, 245 samples 129 individuals, 11 samples
from 6 individuals positive plasmodium, one these
infections found s. imperator. importantly, cytochrome b sequences
were 100% identical former isolates p. malariae humans p.
brasilianum saimiri sp. chronic infections detected evidenced by
repeated infections (7) two individuals across 4-year study period.
furthermore, 4 5 infected emperor tamarins part single group
spanning entire study period. overall, low prevalence reported is
consistent previous findings. study identifies two new natural hosts
for p. brasilianum provides evidence support chronic infections in
wildlife populations. given callitrichids often found mixed-species
associations primates resilient human-disturbed
environments, could contribute maintenance p. malariae populations
if future work provides entomological epidemiological evidence indicating
human zoonotic infections.
