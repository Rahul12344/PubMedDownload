msp2 intrinsically disordered protein abundant merozoite
surface essential parasite plasmodium falciparum. naturally-acquired
antibody responses msp2 biased towards dimorphic sequences within the
central variable region msp2 linked naturally-acquired
protection malaria. phase iib study, msp2-containing vaccine induced
an immune response reduced parasitemias strain-specific manner. a
subsequent phase study vaccine contained dimorphic forms msp2
induced antibodies exhibited functional activity vitro. assessed 
the contribution conserved variable regions msp2 generation 
of strain-transcending antibody response generating msp2 chimeras that
included conserved variable regions 3d7 fc27 alleles. robust
anti-msp2 antibody responses targeting conserved variable regions were
generated mice, although fine specificity balance responses 
these regions differed amongst constructs tested. observed significant
differences antibody subclass distribution responses chimeras.
our results suggest chimeric msp2 antigens elicit broad immune
response suitable protection different strains p. falciparum.
