histone variants important components eukaryotic chromatin alter
chromatin structure confer specialized functions. h2b variant histones are
rare nature evolved independently phyla apicomplexa and
trypanasomatida. here, investigate apicomplexan-specific plasmodium
falciparum histone variant pf h2b.z show within nucleosomes pf h2b.z
dimerizes h2a variant pf h2a.z pf h2b.z pf h2a.z occupancy 
correlates subset genes examined. double-variant nucleosomes also
carry common markers euchromatin like h3k4me3 histone acetylation. pf
h2b.z levels elevated intergenic regions across genome, except 
var multigene family, pf h2a.z/pf h2b.z double-variant nucleosomes only
enriched promoter single active var copy enrichment is
developmentally regulated. importantly, pattern seems specific var
genes apply heterochromatic gene families involved red
blood cell invasion also subject clonal expression. thus, pf
h2a.z/pf h2b.z double-variant nucleosomes appear highly specific
function regulation p. falciparum virulence.
