hemolytic diseases associated elevated levels circulating free heme
that mediate endothelial dysfunction directly via redox reactions with
biomolecules indirectly upregulating enzymatic sources reactive species.
a key enzymatic source reactive species purine catabolizing
enzyme, xanthine oxidase (xo) oxidation hypoxanthine xanthine and
subsequent oxidation xanthine uric acid generates superoxide (o2•-) and
hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). xo studied 120 years, much
remains unknown regarding specific mechanistic roles enzyme in
pathologic processes. gap knowledge stems several interrelated
issues including: 1) lethality global xo deletion absence of
tissue-specific xo knockout models coalesced relegate proof-of-principle 
experimentation pharmacology; 2) xo mobile thus upregulated
locally secreted circulation impact distal vascular beds by
high-affinity association glycocalyx endothelium; 3)
endothelial-bound xo significantly resistant (> 50%) inhibition by
allopurinol, principle compound used xo inhibition clinic well 
as laboratory. known circulating xo elevated hemolytic
diseases including sickle cell, malaria sepsis, little understood
regarding role pathologies. such, aim review to
define current understanding regarding effect hemolysis (free heme) on
circulating xo levels well subsequent impact xo-derived oxidants 
hemolytic disease processes.
