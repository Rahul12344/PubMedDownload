development safe, effective affordable malaria vaccine central to
global disease control efforts. one highly regarded proteins for
inclusion asexual blood stage subunit vaccine 19-kda c-terminal
fragment merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1(19)). production vaccine
antigens plants potentially overcome cost delivery hurdles, set out
to produce msp1(19) plants, characterise protein test its
immunogenicity using mouse model. plasmodium yoelii msp1(19) (pymsp1(19)) was
produced nicotiana benthamiana using magniconÂ® deconstructed tmv-based
viral vector. pymsp1(19) yield least 23% total soluble protein (tsp;3-4
mg/g fwt) achieved using codon-optimised construct targeted to
the apoplast. freeze-dried leaf powder contained least 20 mg pymsp1(19) per
gram dry weight protein retained immunogenicity form more
than 2 years. characterisation studies, including sds-page, mass spectrometry and
circular dichroism, indicated plant-expressed pymsp1(19) similar 
its escherichia coli- saccharomyces cerevisiae-expressed counterparts.
purified plant-made pymsp1(19) induced strong immune responses following
intraperitoneal immunisation, although titres lower induced an
equivalent dose purified e. coli-expressed pymsp1(19). reason 
uncertain may due differences oligomerisation profile the
vaccines. plant-made pymsp1(19) vaccine also found orally
immunogenic delivered alone following immunisation pymsp1(19) dna 
vaccine. study adds increasing body research supporting the
feasibility plants factory production malaria antigens,
and safe affordable platform oral delivery temperature-stable
malaria vaccine.
