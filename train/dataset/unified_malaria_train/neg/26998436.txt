introduction: emergence chloroquine (cq) resistance plasmodium falciparum
has increased morbidity mortality falciparum malaria worldwide.
artemisinin-based combination therapies recommended world health
organization first line treatment falciparum malaria. numerous
molecular markers implicated cq artemisinin resistance.
materials methods: total 26 confirmed cases falciparum malaria (by
giemsa stained thick thin smear, quantitative buffy coat,
immunochromatographic test, polymerase chain reaction [pcr]) included 
the study. 5 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood sample was
collected stored -20Â°c till use. plasmodium dna extracted using qiaamp
whole blood dna extraction kit. pcr done amplify pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfserca,
and pfmrp1 genes amplicons obtained sequenced macrogen, inc.,
korea. single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) analysis done using bio-edit
sequence alignment editor.
results: four genes targeted, noted snp pfcrt gene alone. 
this snp (g > t) noted 658(th) position gene, seen in
13 patients. pfmdr1 pfserca genes present 9 14 patients
respectively. could find snps genes. snp pfcrt
gene significantly associated adverse outcome neither
altered disease progression.
conclusion: presence single snp may associated adverse
clinical outcome. sample size small, may able to
detect known unknown polymorphisms.
