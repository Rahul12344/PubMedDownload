background: differentiation gametocyte-producing plasmodium falciparum
clones depends high levels stage-specific transcripts high genetic
diversity selected genotyping marker obtained high-resolution typing 
method. analyzing consecutive samples one host, contribution each
infecting clone transmission dynamics gametocyte production in
multiclone infections studied.
methods: evaluated capillary electrophoresis based differentiation 6
length-polymorphic gametocyte genes. rna dna 25 µl whole blood 46
individuals burkina faso simultaneously genotyped.
results: highest discrimination power achieved pfs230 18 alleles,
followed pfg377 15 alleles. assays performed parallel rna
and dna, 85.7% pfs230 samples 59.5% pfg377 samples contained at
least one matching genotype dna rna.
conclusions: imperfect detection both, dna rna, identified as
major limitation investigating transmission dynamics, owing primarily 
volume blood processed incomplete representation clones 
sample tested. abundant low-density gametocyte carriers impede clone
detectability, may improved analyzing larger volumes detecting
initially sequestered gametocyte clones follow-up samples.
