background: drug resistance remains major public health challenge malaria
treatment eradication. individual loci associated drug resistance to
many antimalarials identified, epistasis other
resistance mechanisms yet elucidated.
results: previously described two mutations cytoplasmic prolyl-trna
synthetase (cprs) gene confer resistance halofuginone. describe here
the evolutionary trajectory halofuginone resistance two independent drug
resistance selections plasmodium falciparum. using novel methodology, 
discover unexpected non-genetic drug resistance mechanism p. falciparum
utilizes genetic modification cprs. p. falciparum first upregulates
its proline amino acid homeostasis response halofuginone pressure. show 
that non-genetic adaptation halofuginone likely mediated by
differential rna expression precedes mutation amplification cprs
gene. tracking evolution two drug resistance selections whole 
genome sequencing, demonstrate cprs locus accounts the
majority genetic adaptation halofuginone p. falciparum. further
validate copy-number variations cprs locus also contribute to
halofuginone resistance.
conclusions: provide three-step model multi-locus evolution of
halofuginone drug resistance p. falciparum. informed genomic approaches,
our results provide first comprehensive view evolutionary trajectory
malaria parasites take achieve drug resistance. understanding the
multiple genetic non-genetic mechanisms drug resistance informs we
will design pair future anti-malarials clinical use.
