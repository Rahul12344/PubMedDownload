objective: establish fluorescent quantitative pcr (fq-pcr) method for
quantitative detection species identification plasmodium sporozoites in
anopheles mosquitoes.
methods: one pair human plasmodium genus-specific primers based 18s rrna
genes used reaction system reaction condition fq-pcr were
optimized using mixture plasmodium 18s rrna gene recombinant plasmids
and anopheles dna template. specificity verified using four
plasmodium spp. 18s rrna gene plasmid dna well mosquito dna the
plasmodium species identified according value melting temperature
(tm). standard curve made using p. vivax 18s rrna gene recombinant
plasmids serially diluted negative anopheles dna template. the
sensitivity analysed using plasmid dna laboratory infected sporozoite 
positive mosquito dna, respectively. different parts different amounts of
anopheles dna added reaction system investigate influence of
anopheles dna assessment.
results: specific amplification mosquito dna human blood
dna. specific amplification plasmodium 18s rna gene recombinant
plasmids tm(s) p. malariae, p. falciparum, p. ovale p. vivax 
71.0, 72.7, 73.9 degrees c 75.9 degrees c, respectively, easy to
be identified. standard curve indicated good linear relationship between
the cycle threshold (ct) template concentration (r = -0.99). sensitivity 
was 50 copies plasmid dna one sporozoite positive mosquito dna diluted by
32 times mosquito dna. anopheles dna could inhibite fq-pcr reaction. the
ct value amplification showed good reproducibility within same
experiment among different experiments.
conclusion: novel sybr green based fq-pcr method developed study
shows high sensitivity specificity used quantitative
detection species identification sporozoites mosquitoes.
