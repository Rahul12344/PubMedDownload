background: anopheles maculipennis complex, historic vector malaria,
causes serious medical problems worldwide exhibits different behaviours.
studying odorant-binding proteins (obps), influence chemosensory
system behavioural responses, essential understanding population
structure developing effective control measures vector. the
present study designed identify analyse obp1 gene an.
maculipennis.
methods: adults an. maculipennis sensu stricto collected zanjan
province, northwest iran, gdnas female mosquitoes extracted.
fragments an. maculipennis obp1 (amacobp1) gene amplified using
degenerate specific primers, amplicons selected for
sequencing.
results: analysis amplified products identified sequence amacobp1 
gene 1341 bp long. gene contains three exons (5', internal, 3'of
160, 256, 18 bp, respectively) encodes 144 amino acids. sizes of
introns ii deduced gene 268 358 nucleotides, respectively. the
amino acid sequence c-terminal amacobp1 similar major
malaria vector anopheles species. however, n-terminal specific signal
peptide 19 amino acids. peptide conserved different studied
populations, sequence amino acids shows variation among
anopheline species.
conclusions: degenerate primers study suggested studying obp1
gene anopheles species. amacobp1 gene proposed molecular marker for
the detection intraspecific ecotypes diagnosis different species within
maculipennis group. moreover, n-terminal amacobp1 peptide recommended
as molecular marker identify amacobp1 expression patterns different
chemosensory organs assessing molecular mechanisms developing novel
behavioural disturbance agents control an. maculipennis.
