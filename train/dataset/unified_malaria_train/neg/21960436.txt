quinine used treatment plasmodium falciparum severe malaria.
however, drug's mode action mechanisms resistance still
poorly understood subject debate. effort clarify questions,
we used yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae model pharmacological studies
with quinine. following previous work examined yeast genomic
expression program response quinine, explore genome-wide screen
for altered susceptibility quinine using euroscarf collection yeast
deletion strains. identified 279 quinine-susceptible strains, among 112 
conferred hyper-susceptibility phenotype. expression genes, mainly
involved carbohydrate metabolism, iron uptake ion homeostasis functions,
is required quinine resistance yeast. sixty-two genes whose deletion leads
to increased quinine resistance also identified screen, including
several genes encoding ribosome protein subunits. well-known potential drug
targets plasmodium associated quinine action first time in
this study. suggested involvement phosphate signaling transport in
quinine tolerance also studied, activation phosphate
starvation-responsive genes observed mild-induced quinine stress.
finally, p. falciparum homology searches performed selected group of
41 genes. thirty-two encoded proteins possess homologs parasite, including
subunits parasitic vacuolar h(+)-atpase complex, ion phosphate
importers, several ribosome protein subunits, suggesting results
obtained yeast good candidates transposed explored p.
falciparum context.
