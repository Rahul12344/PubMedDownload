in study, explore blood parasite prevalence, infection intensity, and
co-infection levels urban population feral pigeons columba livia cape
town. analyze effect blood parasites host body condition the
association melanin expression host's plumage parasite
infection intensity co-infection levels. relating haemosporidian
parasite itself, study genetic diversity means dna barcoding
(cytochrome b) show geographic host distribution related parasite 
lineages pigeons worldwide. blood 195 c. livia individuals collected 
from april june 2018. morphometric measurements plumage melanism were
recorded every captured bird. haemosporidian prevalence infection
intensity determined screening blood smears parasite lineages dna 
sequencing. prevalence haemoproteus spp. high 96.9%. body condition
of hosts negatively associated infection intensity. however,
infection intensity unrelated plumage melanism. cytochrome b sequences
revealed presence four haemoproteus lineages population pigeons,
which show high levels co-occurrence within individual birds. three lineages
(haecol1, coliv03, coqui05) belong haemoproteus columbae differ by
0.1% 0.8% cytochrome b gene. another lineage (coliv06) differs 8.3% 
from latter ones linked morphospecies, yet. parasites of
the genera leucocytozoon plasmodium detected.
