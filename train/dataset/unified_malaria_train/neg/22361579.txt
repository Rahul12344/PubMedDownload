toxoplasma gondii belongs phylum apicomplexa, diverse group early
branching unicellular eukaryotes related dinoflagellates ciliates. like
several apicomplexa plasmodium (the causative agent malaria), t.
gondii human pathogen responsible potentially lethal disease called
toxoplasmosis. apicomplexa complex life cycles, involving intermediate 
hosts vectors, include obligatory intracellular developmental stages.
in case malaria toxoplasmosis, replicative process, leading
to ultimate lysis host cell, causing symptoms the
disease. toxoplasma, invasive fast-replicating form parasite
is called tachyzoite. autophagy fast-growing field of
research recent years, much known relevance this
catabolic process medically important apicomplexan parasites. vesicles
resembling autophagosomes described drug-treated plasmodium parasites
in early 1970s potential role autophagy organelle recycling
during differentiation plasmodium life stages also recently
described. interestingly, recent database searches identified putative
orthologs core machinery responsible formation autophagosomes
in several protists, including toxoplasma. spite apparently reduced
machinery (only one-third yeast atg genes appear conserved),
t. gondii seemed thus able perform macroautophagy, cellular functions 
of pathway parasite remained demonstrated.
