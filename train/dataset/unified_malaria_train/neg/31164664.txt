the evolution genetic mechanisms host immune evasion anti-malarial
resistance enabled plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite inflict high
morbidity mortality human populations. studies p. falciparum
genetic diversity focused single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps),
assisting identification drug resistance-associated loci the
chloroquine related crt sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine related dhfr. whilst larger
structural variants known impact adaptation, example, mdr1
duplications anti-malarial resistance, large-scale, genome-wide study 
clinical isolates undertaken using whole genome sequencing data. by
applying structural variant detection pipeline across whole genome sequence
data 2,855 clinical isolates 21 malaria-endemic countries, identified 
>70,000 specific deletions >600 duplications. structural variants are
rare (48.5% deletions 94.7% duplications found single isolates) 
with 2.4% deletions 0.2% duplications found >5% global isolates. 
a subset variants present high frequency drug-resistance related
genes including mdr1, gch1 promoter region, putative novel duplication 
of crt. regional-specific variants identified, companion visualisation
tool developed assist web-based investigation polymorphisms 
by wider scientific community.
