the malaria merozoite invades erythrocytes vertebrate host. iterative
rounds asexual intraerythrocytic replication result disease. proteases play
pivotal roles erythrocyte invasion, little understood mode 
of action. plasmodium falciparum malaria merozoite surface sheddase, pfsub2, 
is one poorly characterized example. examined molecular
determinants underlie mechanisms pfsub2 trafficked initially
to invasion-associated apical organelles (micronemes) across surface
of free merozoite. show authentic promoter activity important 
correct localization pfsub2, likely requiring canonical features within the
intergenic region 5' pfsub2 locus. demonstrate trafficking
of pfsub2 beyond early compartment secretory pathway requires
autocatalytic protease activity. finally, show pfsub2 transmembrane
domain required microneme targeting, cytoplasmic domain is
essential surface translocation protease parasite posterior
following discharge micronemes. interplay pre- post-translational
regulatory elements coordinate subcellular trafficking pfsub2 provides
the parasite exquisite control enzyme-substrate interactions.
