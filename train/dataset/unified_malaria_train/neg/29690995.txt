malaria major driving force evolution human genome. in
sub-saharan african populations, two neighbouring polymorphisms complement
receptor one (cr1) gene, named sl2 mccb, occur high frequencies,
consistent selection malaria. previous studies inconclusive.
using large case-control study severe malaria kenyan children and
statistical models adjusted confounders, estimate relationship between
sl2 mccb malaria phenotypes, find opposing associations.
the sl2 polymorphism associated markedly reduced odds cerebral malaria
and death, mccb polymorphism associated increased odds of
cerebral malaria. also identify apparent interaction sl2 and
α+thalassaemia, protective association sl2 greatest children 
normal α-globin. complex relationship three mutations may
explain previous conflicting findings, highlighting importance considering
genetic interactions disease-association studies.
