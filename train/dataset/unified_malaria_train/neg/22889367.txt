background: malaria caused plasmodium falciparum infects roughly 30,000
individuals haiti year. haiti used chloroquine (cq) first-line
treatment malaria many years result concerns that
malaria parasites may develop resistance cq time. therefore is
important prepare alternative malaria treatment options cq
resistance develop. many malaria-endemic regions, antifolates,
particularly pyrimethamine (pyr) sulphadoxine (sdx) treatment combination
(sp), used alternative cq resistance developed. this
study evaluated mutations dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and
dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes confer pyr sdx resistance,
respectively, p. falciparum provide baseline data haiti. study is
the first comprehensive study examine pyr sdx resistance genotypes p.
falciparum haiti.
methods: dna extracted dried blood spots genotyped pyr sdx
resistance mutations p. falciparum using pcr dna sequencing methods.
sixty-one samples genotyped pyr resistance codons 51, 59, 108 164
of dhfr gene 58 samples genotyped sdx resistance codons 436,
437, 540 dhps gene p. falciparum.
results: thirty-three percent (20/61) samples carried mutation codon 
108 (s108n) dhfr gene. mutations dhfr codons 51, 59, 164 were
observed samples. addition, mutations observed dhps
at three codons (436, 437, 540) examined. significant difference was
observed samples collected urban vs rural sites (welch's t-test
p-value = 0.53 permutations p-value = 0.59).
conclusion: study shown presence s108n mutation p.
falciparum confers low-level pyr resistance haiti. however, absence
of sdx resistance mutations suggests sp resistance may present in
haiti. results important implications ongoing discussions on
alternative malaria treatment options haiti.
