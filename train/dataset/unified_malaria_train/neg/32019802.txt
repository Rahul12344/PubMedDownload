throughout plasmodium berghei ls, covering early 2 h postinfection
(hpi) extending 48 hpi. data revealed hundreds genes are
differentially expressed 2 hpi multiple genes shown important
for later infection upregulated early 12 hpi. using hierarchical
clustering along coexpression analysis, identified clusters functionally 
enriched important liver-stage processes interactions host

correlated expression apiap2 transcription factors, showing
enrichment mostly uncharacterized dna binding motifs. finding indicates
potential ls targets transcription factors, also hinting at
alternative uncharacterized dna binding motifs transcription factors during
this stage. work presents window previously undescribed

investigated whole-transcriptome changes occurring early 2 hpi of
