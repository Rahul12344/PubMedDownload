we assessed prevalence plasmodium falciparum frequency dhfr
triple mutation associated antifolate drug resistance among p.
falciparum isolates obtained pregnant women ilorin, nigeria. study
included 179 women second third trimester pregnancy been
exposed intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp) with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. thick thin blood films pcr used for
malaria parasite detection. blood group hemoglobin concentration also
determined. mutations p. falciparum dhfr analyzed sequencing dna
obtained blood spots filter paper. prevalence p. falciparum the
population (pcr corrected) 44.1% (79/179) 66.7% 33.3% second 
and third trimester, respectively. primigravide (51.3%) infected than
multigravide (48.7%) difference statistically significant. women 
in blood group highest p. falciparum malaria infection (30.8%). the
mean hemoglobin concentration lower among infected malaria
parasite. also, women malaria parasite (38.4%) anemia compare
to without (21.4%). prevalence p. falciparum dhfr mutant alleles
was 64.1%, 61.5%, 38.5%, 12.8% i51, r59, n108 t108, respectively.
none samples l164 mutation. combined triple dhfr mutation (51 
+ 59 + 108) population 17.9% (7 39). also, prevalence the
triple mutant alleles significantly associated number doses 
sp taken women. findings highlight need regular assessment
of iptp/sp efficacy, evaluation possible alternative drugs.
