malaria worldwide disease caused plasmodium parasites. sesquiterpene
endoperoxide artemisinin isolated artemisia annua discovered has
been accepted use artemisinin-based combinatorial therapies, the
most effective current antimalarial treatment. however, quantity this
compound produced a.Â annua plant low, availability of
artemisinin insufficient treat infected patients. addition, the
emergence artemisinin-resistant plasmodium reported recently. several
techniques applied enhance artemisinin availability, studies
related mode action mechanism resistance malaria-causing 
parasites ongoing. review, summarize application modern
technologies improve production artemisinin, including ongoing
research artemisinin biosynthetic genes artemisia species. the
current understanding mode action artemisinin well the
mechanism resistance compound plasmodium parasites also
presented. finally, current situation malaria infection future
direction antimalarial drug development discussed.
