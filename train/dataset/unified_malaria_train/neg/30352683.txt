correlating aberrant mirna levels imported malaria blood stage is
required better understand in vivo biological molecular processes that
are involved response plasmodium falciparum infection find new
biomarkers diagnosis tools. used parallel microarray-based approach to
investigate integrated view host mirna expression profile changes
in response p. falciparum infection whole blood obtained six subjects 
with adult imported falciparum malaria (aifm) six normal subjects. first
investigated functions 1007 significantly differentially expressed genes
from microarrays predicted 56 putative pathways participating malaria
pathogenesis, reflected systemic changes host falciparum
infection. then, validated silico-predicted targets 50
differentially modulated mirnas (7 upregulated 43 downregulated) examining
the actual mrna expression particular genes gene expression
profile database; putative target gene sets grouped functional
categories investigate roles differentially expressed mirnas. we
considered 36 intersecting putative pathways, involved in
multiple immune response processes, cell defense response, immune
response, tnf signaling pathway, cell receptor signaling pathway, may
actually regulated differentially expressed mirnas. additionally, we
identified five enriched upregulated mirna sets (mir-3135b, mir-6780b-5p,
mir-1246, mir-6126, mir-3613-5p) potential blood biomarkers of
immunopathological status prediction early host responses, disease
prognosis, severe outcomes aifm.
