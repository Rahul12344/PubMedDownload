malaria transmitted motile sporozoites injected dermis an
infected female anopheles mosquito. inside mosquito vector, sporozoites
egress midgut-associated oocysts eventually penetrate acinar cells
of salivary glands. parasite-encoded factors exclusive vital roles the
insect vector studied classical reverse genetics. here, we
characterized vivo roles plasmodium berghei falstatin/icp (inhibitor of
cysteine proteases). protein previously suggested act protease
inhibitor erythrocyte invasion. show targeted gene disruption that
loss icp function affect growth inside mammalian host causes 
a complete defect sporozoite transmission. sporogony occurred normally in
icp(-) parasites, hemocoel sporozoites showed defect continuous gliding

considered ideal drug targets treatment wide range diseases,
including cancer parasitic infections. protozoan parasites, including
leishmania, trypanosoma, plasmodium, cysteine proteases play important roles 
in life cycle progression. mouse malaria model provides unprecedented
opportunity study roles parasite-encoded inhibitor cysteine

found evidence icp influences disease progression parasite virulence. 
instead, discovered factor necessary parasite movement and
