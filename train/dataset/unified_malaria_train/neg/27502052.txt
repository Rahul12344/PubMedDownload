excess cellular heme toxic, malaria parasites regulate levels during
hemoglobin digestion. aminoacyl-trna synthetases ubiquitous enzymes, of
these, arginyl-trna synthetase (rrs) unique enzymatic product of
charged trna required protein synthesis degradation. show that
plasmodium falciparum arginyl-trna synthetase (pfrrs) active, cytosolic,
and monomeric enzyme. high-resolution crystal structure highlights critical
structural differences human enzyme. show hemin binds to
and inhibits aminoacylation activity pfrrs. hemin induces dimeric form
of pfrrs that is thus rendered enzymatically dead unable to recognize
its cognate trna(arg). excessive hemin in chloroquine-treated malaria parasites
results significantly reduced charged trna(arg) levels, thus suggesting
deceleration protein synthesis. these data together suggest the
inhibition of plasmodium falciparum arginyl-trna synthetase synergized
with existing antimalarials potent drug cocktails malaria
parasites.
