objective: investigate mutation genes associated drug resistance
(pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr k13） imported plasmodium falciparum shandong
province.
methods: blood collected 94 falciparum malaria cases returned from
africa 2014. genomic dna p. falciparum extracted blood
samples nested pcr performed using primers specifically designed for
pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr k13. pcr products sequenced. gene mutations
were analyzed sequence alignment.
results: 94 imported cases 18 african countries. nested pcr was
successful dna blood samples except pfcrt amplification in
one sample. sequence analysis revealed three types mutations pfcrt k76t
（36.6%, 34/93）, pfmdr1 n86y （21.3%, 20/94）, pfdhfr s108n （98.9%, 93/94）
（χ2=127.5， p<0.05）. k13 c580y mutation found. co-occurrence k76t,
n86y, s108n found 6 blood samples （6.5%）, imported from
liberia（2）, angola（1）, equatorial guinea（1）, congo（1）, guinea（1）.
co-occurrence k76t s108n mutations found 28 samples（30.1%）, and
that n86y s108n 14 samples （15.1%）. forty-four samples（47.3%） harbored 
s108n mutation only, one sample null mutations.
conclusion: mutations pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr imported
plasmodium falciparum shandong province. mutation found k13
gene.
