the objective work compare quality, purity quantity dna
isolated dried blood spots (dbs) three methods (chelex-100, qiaamp dna
mini kit, te (tris edta)-buffer). sample collection performed six
districts odisha, india screened cases clinical malaria dengue 
and vector density. mosquito abdomens spotted whatman 3mm (merck) filter 
paper dried 10 min room temperature. dna isolated dbs using
three methods (chelex-100, qiaamp dna mini kit, te-buffer), pcr used 
to determine feeding behaviours vector mosquitoes. dna quantified
using uv-spectrophotometer, q-pcr used determine target gene
copy number compare methods. qiaamp dna mini kit method used as
the reference method. yield purity dna extracted chelex-100 and
te 14-72 ng/µl 1.51-1.85 9-50 ng/µl 1.68-2.1, respectively. dna 
extracted using chelex-100 method stored 1 month - 20 °c 
was suitable later use. chelex-100 method sensitivity 99.5% 
specificity 78%. bland-altman plot suggested chelex-100 method 
similar qiaamp dna mini kit method determining feeding behaviours 
of vector mosquitoes. chelex-100 method simple, cost-effective, safe
and requires minimal time dna extraction dried blood spots. malaria
and dengue research, detecting feeding behaviours mosquito dna from
dried blood spots filter paper pcr easy, minimally invasive and
inexpensive molecular technique performed remote areas.
