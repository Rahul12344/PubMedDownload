we characterized complete nucleic amino acid sequences plasmodium 
inui circumsporozoite protein (pincsp) gene analyzed nucleotide diversity
across entire pincsp gene using 7 field isolates strains taiwan 
ii obtained formosan macaques (macaca cyclopis) taiwan. length the
circumsporozoite protein ( csp ) gene ranged 1077 1125 bp. size
polymorphisms due variations number tandem repeat units. the
non-repetitive (nr) region exhibited high homology (99.1 ∼ 100 98.7 ∼ 100% at
the nucleotide amino acid levels, respectively) conserved among the
variants (nucleotide diversities, π, 5'nr 3'nr regions 0.00364
and 0.00392, respectively). central repetitive (cr) region, decomposed 
the sequences 2 kinds repeating amino acid motifs, i.e., repeat unit
r1, pa(p/a)(p/a)a(e)gg (n  =  11-13), following repeat unit r2:
p(a/g)(a/p/g)(p/q)aq(n/k) (n  =  9-10). analyzing repeat sequences showed
evidence 3 genetic mechanisms generating variations repeats 
pincsp gene, i.e., point mutation, insertion, recombination. findings
suggest polymorphisms pincsp gene essentially limited cr
region, showed much greater variability terms length, number of
repeats, sequence.
