multidrug-resistant plasmodium falciparum greater mekong subregion of
southeast asia major threat malaria elimination requires close
surveillance. study, collected 107 longitudinal clinical samples p.
falciparum 2007-2012 malaria hypoendemic region china-myanmar 
border measured vitro susceptibilities 10 antimalarial drugs.
overall, parasites significantly different ic50 values drugs
tested compared reference 3d7 strain. parasites also genotyped 
seven genes associated drug resistance including pfcrt, pfmdr1,
pfmrp1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfnhe1, pfk13 genes. despite withdrawal of
chloroquine antifolates treating p. falciparum, parasites remained
highly resistant drugs mutations pfcrt, pfdhfr, pfdhps genes 
were highly prevalent almost reached fixation study parasite
population. except pyronaridine, quinine lumefantrine, tested
drugs exhibited significant temporal variations least years, 
only chloroquine piperaquine clear temporal trend continuous
increase ic50s. pfmrp1 gene, several mutations associated with
altered sensitivity number drugs tested including chloroquine,
piperaquine, lumefantrine dihydroartemisinin. association pfk13
mutations resistance multiple drugs suggests potential evolution pfk13
mutations amid multidrug resistance genetic background. furthermore, network
analysis drug resistance genes indicated certain haplotypes associated
multidrug resistance persisted years, albeit year-to-year
fluctuations predominant haplotypes.
