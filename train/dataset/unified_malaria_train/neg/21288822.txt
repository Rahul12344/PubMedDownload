background: 2005, ghana adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (act)
for primary treatment falciparum malaria. comprehensive study the
drug-resistance-associated mutations genetic lineages lead a
better understanding evolution antimalarial drug resistance this
region.
methods: pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhps, dhfr mutations associated chloroquine 
(cq) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance microsatellite loci
flanking genes genotyped plasmodium falciparum isolates ghana.
results: prevalence mutations associated cq sp resistance
was high ghana. however, observed decrease prevalence pfcrt
k76t mutation northern ghana change drug policy cq act.
analysis genetic diversity differentiation microsatellite loci flanking
all 4 genes indicated strong selection, cq
and sp use. triple-mutant pfcrt dhfr alleles ghana derived from
southeast asia, whereas double-mutant dhfr, dhps, pfmdr1 alleles 
african lineage.
conclusion: possible role pfmdr1 amodiaquine mefloquine 
resistance, demonstrating selection pfmdr1 defining lineages resistant 
alleles african population holds great importance.
