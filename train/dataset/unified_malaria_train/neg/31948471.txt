background: klebsiella pneumoniae leading cause bloodstream infection
(bsi). strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) or
carbapenemases considered global priority pathogens new treatment
and prevention strategies urgently required, due severely limited
therapeutic options. south southeast asia major hubs for
antimicrobial-resistant (amr) k. pneumoniae also characteristically
antimicrobial-sensitive, community-acquired "hypervirulent" strains. the
emergence hypervirulent amr strains lack data exopolysaccharide
diversity pose challenge k. pneumoniae bsi control strategies worldwide.
methods: conducted retrospective genomic epidemiology study 365 bsi k.
pneumoniae seven major healthcare facilities across south southeast
asia, extracting clinically relevant information (amr, virulence, k antigen
loci) using kleborate, k. pneumoniae-specific genomic typing tool.
results: k. pneumoniae bsi isolates highly diverse, comprising 120
multi-locus sequence types (sts) 63 k-loci. esbl carbapenemase gene
frequencies 47% 17%, respectively. aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc),
associated hypervirulence, detected 28% isolates. importantly, 7% 
of isolates harboured iuc plus esbl and/or carbapenemase genes. latter
represent genotypic amr-virulence convergence, generally considered a
rare phenomenon particularly common among south asian bsi (17%). of
greatest concern, identified seven novel plasmids carrying iuc amr
genes, raising prospect co-transfer phenotypes among k.
pneumoniae.
conclusions: k. pneumoniae bsi south southeast asia caused by
different sts predominating regions, higher
frequency acquired virulence determinants. k. pneumoniae carrying iuc and
amr genes also detected higher rates reported elsewhere.
the study demonstrates genomics-based surveillance-reporting full molecular
profiles including sts, amr, virulence serotype locus information-can help
standardise comparisons sites identify regional differences in
pathogen populations.
