are developed tested, including pfspz vaccine, pfspz are
attenuated irradiation, pfspz-cvac, fully infectious pfspz are
attenuated vivo concomitant administration anti-malarial drug, and
pfspz-ga1, pfspz attenuated gene knockout. forty-three
research groups 15 countries, organized international pfspz consortium 
(i-pfspz-c), collaborating advance program providing intellectual,
clinical, financial support. fourteen clinical trials products 
been completed usa, europe africa, two underway least 12
more planned 2015-2016 us (four trials), germany (2 trials),
tanzania, kenya, mali, burkina faso, ghana equatorial guinea. sanaria
anticipates application license first generation product early late
