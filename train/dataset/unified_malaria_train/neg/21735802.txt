we compared light microscopy examination semi-nested multiplex pcr
(snm-pcr) assay endemic areas islamic republic iran. total 68
individuals malaria-positive suspected malaria symptoms included in
the study. giemsa-stained thick blood films examined light
microscope malaria parasites 100 200 fields. dna extracted from
blood samples snm-pcr based amplification small sub-unit
ribosomal rna (ssrrna) gene sequences applied. microscopical examination
showed 48.5% (33.8% p. vivax 14.7% p.falciparum) 50% (35.3% p. vivax
and 14.7% p. falciparum) samples positive 100 200 fields
respectively. snm-pcr showed results 200 field microscopy.
