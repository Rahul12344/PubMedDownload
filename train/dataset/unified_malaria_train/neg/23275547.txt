molecular interactions parasite host key ability 
the parasite enter host persist. understanding genes and
proteins involved interactions limited. better understand these
processes would advantageous range methods predict pairs of
genes involved interactions. correlated gene expression profiles be
used identify molecular interactions within species. extended
the concept different species, showing genes correlated expression
are likely encode proteins, directly indirectly participate in
host-parasite interaction. go examine predictions molecular
interactions malaria parasite mammalian host insect 
vector. approach could applied study interaction species,
for example, host parasites pathogens, also symbiotic
and commensal pairings.
