plasmodium parasites two actin isoforms. actin ubiquitously expressed, 
while second actin isoform expressed sexual stages ookinetes.
reverse genetic analysis revealed two phenotypes parasites lacking the
protein: block male gametogenesis (exflagellation) second phenotype in
oocyst development, dependent upon expression gene female
gametocytes. here, report genetic complementation two independent 
mutants lacking actin ii fully restore wild-type function. constructs
were integrated c-rrna locus, previously used expression of
transgenes, order determine dependence expression actin ii
flanking genomic regions. partial restoration male gametogenesis achieved 
when transgene contained, addition coding region, 1.2 kb upstream
of actin ii open reading frame. another transgene, comprised 2.7 kb 
actin ii 5' flanking regions cognate 3' downstream sequence, fully
restored exflagellation. however, complemented strains, oocyst
development severely impaired compared wt. data suggest that
male gametocyte expression actin ii dependent upon extensive flanking
regions, female expression requires even longer genomic sequences for
correct expression gene.
