although effectiveness bcg vaccination preventing adult pulmonary
tuberculosis (tb) highly variable, epidemiologic studies suggested 
that bcg provides general health benefits vaccinees including reducing
the impact asthma, leprosy, possibly malaria. evaluate whether 
bcg immunization protects malarial parasitemia define molecular
correlates non-specific immunity, mice vaccinated bcg 
challenged 2 months later asexual blood stage plasmodium yoelii 17xnl (pynl)
parasites. following challenge pynl, significant decreases parasitemia
were observed bcg vaccinated mice relative naïve controls. identify
immune molecules may associated bcg-induced protection, gene
expression evaluated rt-pcr i) naïve controls, ii) bcg-vaccinated mice,
iii) pynl infected mice iv) bcg vaccinated/pynl infected mice 0, 1, 5, and
9 days p. yoelii infection. expression results showed i) bcg
immunization induces expression least 18 genes including the
anti-microbial molecules lactoferrin, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil major
basic protein cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (cramp); ii) 
active pynl infection suppresses expression important immune response
molecules; iii) extent pynl-induced suppression specific genes is
reduced bcg-vaccinated/pynl infected mice. validate gene expression
data, demonstrated pre-treatment malaria parasites lactoferrin or
the cathelicidin ll-37 peptide decreases level pynl parasitemias mice. 
overall, study suggests bcg vaccination induces expression of
non-specific immune molecules including antimicrobial peptides may provide 
an overall benefit vaccinees limiting infections unrelated pathogens
such plasmodium parasites.
