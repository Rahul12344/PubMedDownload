the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum requires efficient egress of
an infected red blood cell pathogenesis. egress event highly
coordinated mediated several signaling proteins, including the
plant-like pfalciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (pfcdpk5). knockdown of
pfcdpk5 results egress block parasites trapped inside host 
cells. mechanism pfcdpk5-dependent block, however, remains unknown.
here, show pfcdpk5 colocalizes specialized set parasite
organelles known micronemes required discharge, implicating
failure step cause egress defect pfcdpk5-deficient
parasites. furthermore, show pfcdpk5 cooperates pfalciparum
cgmp-dependent kinase (pfpkg) fully activate protease cascade critical for
parasite egress. pfcdpk5-dependent arrest overcome hyperactivation 
of pfpkg physical disruption arrested parasite, show that
both treatments facilitate release micronemes required egress. our
results define molecular mechanism pfcdpk5 function elucidate the
complex signaling pathway parasite egress.importance signs symptoms of
clinical malaria result replication parasites human blood.
efficient egress malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum infected
red blood cell critical pathogenesis. pfalciparum calcium-dependent
protein kinase 5 (pfcdpk5) essential parasite egress. following pfcdpk5
knockdown, parasites remain trapped inside host cell egress, but
the mechanism block remains unknown. show pfcdpk5 colocalizes
with parasite organelles known micronemes. demonstrate pfcdpk5 is
critical discharge micronemes failure step is
the molecular mechanism parasite egress arrest. also show that
hyperactivation cgmp-dependent kinase pkg overcome arrest. our
data suggest small molecules inhibit egress signaling pathway could
be effective antimalarial therapeutics.
