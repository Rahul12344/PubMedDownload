the severe form malaria cerebral malaria caused plasmodium
falciparum. standard malaria diagnosis giemsa stained peripheral blood smear
but false negative findings always reported. moreover, mixed infections are
underestimated routine microscopy. many methods developed to
overcome disadvantages specific sensitive molecular
diagnosis. specific malaria genes amplified polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) many post-pcr methods created. developed gold fabricated
quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) post-pcr method malaria diagnosis. in
this work cheaper silver fabricated qcm developed identify single
and mixed infection p. falciparum plasmodium vivax. biotinylated
malaria probe immobilized silver surface via specific avidin-biotin
interaction. target dna fragment 18s rrna gene amplified and
hybridized qcm immobilized probe. mass changes due dna hybridization
were indicated changes quartz resonance frequencies. validation showed that
malaria silver qcm high diagnostic potency. evaluation suspected 67
febrile blood samples malaria endemic area demonstrated malaria
silver qcm could identify false negative misdiagnosis cases routine
microscopy. analysis cost malaria silver qcm $1/sample analysis
time 30 min blood collection. malaria silver qcm stable at
tropical temperature 6 months. thus, transported used
in remote endemic area. thus, malaria silver qcm accurate, precise,
rapid, cheap, field applicable.
