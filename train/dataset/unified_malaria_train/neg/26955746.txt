this review describes protease inhibitors (pis) target inhibit
proteases, protein digesting enzymes. proteases play crucial task many
biological events including digestion, blood coagulation, apoptosis etc.
regardless crucial roles, need checked regularly pis as
their excess may possibly damage host organism. basis amino acid
composition pis protease-pi enzymatic reactions occur i.e. serine,
cysteine, aspartic acid, classified. nowadays, various pis being
worked upon fight various parasitic viral diseases including malaria,
schistosomiasis, colds, flu', dengue etc. prevent ongoing process begun
by carcinogen exposure keeping check metastasis. also possess
potential reduce carcinogen-induced, increased levels gene amplification to
almost normal levels. pis principally used treatment of
hypertension congestive heart failure blocking conversion angiotensin i
to angiotensin ii example angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis).
also pis target amyloid β-peptide (aβ) level brain prime responsible 
for development alzheimer's disease (ad). also, pis inhibit enzymatic activity
of hiv-1 protease receptor (pr) preventing cleavage events gag gag-pol 
that result production non-virulent virus particles.
