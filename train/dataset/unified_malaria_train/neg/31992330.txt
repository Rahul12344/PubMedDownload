background: 2017, nearly 80% malaria morbidity mortality occurred in
sub-saharan african (ssa) countries india. rapid diagnostic tests (rdts),
especially targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) plasmodium
falciparum, become important diagnostic tool malaria-endemic
areas. however, chances rdt-oriented successful treatment increasingly
jeopardized appearance mutants deletions pfhrp2 pfhrp3
genes. systematic review meta-analysis determines prevalence of
field p. falciparum isolates deletion pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes and
their proportion among false-negative results pfhrp2-based rdts ssa and
india.
methods: eight electronic databases used searching potentially relevant 
publications systematic review analysis, wherein main methodological 
aspects included studies analysed missing links included 
studies identified.
results: total 19 studies included, 16 ssa 3 india. the
pooled prevalence pfhrp2 deletions 8 5% 16 4% pfhrp3
gene deletions africa india, respectively. pooled proportion pfhrp2
gene deletions found among false negative pfhrp2-based rdts results about
27.0 69.0% africa india, respectively.
conclusions: review study indicates relatively high proportion both
pfhrp2/3 genes deletions p. falciparum isolates among false-negative
malaria cases using pfhrp2-based rdt results ssa india. recently the
deletions pfhrp2/3 genes also reported two african countries
(nigeria sudan). review emphasizes importance extensive
studies standardization studies addressing pfhrp2/3 gene deletions 
malarious areas.
