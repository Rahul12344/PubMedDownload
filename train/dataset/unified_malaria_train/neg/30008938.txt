non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) common type lung cancer,
accounting ~80% lung cancer cases. aim present study to
identify key genes pathways nsclc, order improve understanding of
the mechanism lung cancer. gse33532 gene expression dataset, containing 20
normal 80 nsclc samples, used. gene ontology (go) kyoto encyclopedia 
of genes genomes (kegg) analyses performed obtain enrichment data
of differently expressed genes (degs). disease modules within nsclc were
constructed cytoscape, using protein-protein interaction (ppi) search
tool retrieval interacting genes database. addition, kaplan
meier plotter kmplot used assess top hub genes ppi network. 
a result, 1,795 genes identified nsclc; 729 upregulated 1,066
were downregulated. results go analysis indicated upregulated
degs significantly enriched 'biological processes' (bp), including 'cell 
cycle nuclear division'; downregulated degs also significantly
enriched bp, including 'response wounding', 'anatomical structure
morphogenesis' 'response stimulus'. upregulated degs also enriched in
'cell cycle', 'dna replication' 'tumor protein 53 signaling pathway',
while downregulated degs also enriched 'complement coagulation
cascades', 'malaria' 'cell adhesion molecules'. top 9 hub genes were
cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk1), polo-like kinase 1, aurora kinase b, cell
division cycle 20, baculoviral initiator apoptosis repeat containing 5,
mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase b, proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(pcna), centromere protein mad2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, the
kmplot results revealed high expression levels genes resulted
in significantly low survival rates, compared low expression samples
(p<0.05), exception pcna cdk1. pathway crosstalk analysis,
26 nodes 41 interactions divided two groups: one module two 
groups primarily included 'metabolism amino acid' primarily
contained 'tumor necrosis signaling' pathways. conclusion, present study
assisted improving understanding molecular mechanisms underlying
nsclc development, results may help understanding biological
mechanism nsclc.
