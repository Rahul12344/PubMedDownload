insulin insulin-like growth factor signaling (iis) regulates cell death,
repair, autophagy, renewal response stress, damage, pathogen
challenge. therefore, iis fundamental lifespan disease resistance.
previously, showed insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) within a
physiologically relevant range (0.013-0.13 µm) human blood reduced development
of human parasite plasmodium falciparum indian malaria mosquito
anopheles stephensi. low igf1 (0.013 µm) induced foxo p70s6k activation in
the midgut extended mosquito lifespan, whereas high igf1 (0.13 µm) not.
in study physiological effects low high igf1 examined in
detail infer mechanisms dichotomous effects mosquito resistance
and lifespan. following ingestion, low igf1 induced phosphorylation midgut
c-jun-n-terminal kinase (jnk), critical regulator epithelial homeostasis,
but high igf1 not. low high igf1 induced midgut mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ros) synthesis nitric oxide (no) synthase gene expression,
responses necessary sufficient mediate igf1 inhibition p.
falciparum development. however, increased ros apoptosis-associated caspase-3
activity returned baseline levels following low igf1 treatment, were
sustained high igf1 treatment accompanied aberrant expression of
biomarkers mitophagy, stem cell division proliferation. low igf1-induced 
ros likely moderated jnk-induced epithelial cytoprotection well as
p70s6k-mediated growth inhibition apoptosis lifetime a.
stephensi facilitate midgut homeostasis enhanced survivorship. hence,
mitochondrial integrity homeostasis midgut, key signaling center for
iis, targeted coordinately optimize mosquito fitness anti-pathogen
