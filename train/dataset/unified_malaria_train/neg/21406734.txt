background & objectives: comparative genomics evolutionary analyses of
conserved genes enabled us understand complexity genomes of
closely related species. example: β-globin gene present human hemoglobin
is one gene experienced many genetic changes many related taxa
and produced 600 variants. one variant, hbs causes sickle-cell
anemia humans offers protection severe malaria due plasmodium
falciparum. present study, characterized performed evolutionary
comparative analyses ?-globin gene different related unrelated taxa
to comprehensive view evolution.
methods: dna protein sequences β-globin gene downloaded ncbi and
characterized detail nine eutherian (homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, macaca 
mulatta, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, bos taurus, canis familiaris, equus
caballus, oryctolagus cuniculus), dinosaurian (gallus gallus) neopterygii
(danio rerio) taxa. three eutherian (papio anubis, ovis aries sus
scrofa) taxa included analysis protein level included 
at gene level owing lack genomic information. computational and
phylogenetic analyses performed using evolutionary comparative approach.
results: results comparative phylogenetic analyses revealed less
conservation genetic architecture β-globin compared protein
architecture eutherian taxa. dinosaurian neopterygii taxa served 
as outgroups varied gene protein levels.
interpretation & conclusion: remarkably, primates eutherian taxa
including p. anubis showed nine codon position differences absolute
similarity h. sapiens p. troglodytes. absolute conservation coding
region equus caballus (horse) observed. results discussed an
inference role evolutionary forces maintaining close
similarities variations across closely related taxa. further, need to
utilize comparative approaches understanding disease causing genes'
evolution closely related taxa hoped for.
