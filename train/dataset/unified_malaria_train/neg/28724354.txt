background: malaria remains major public health burden resistance has
emerged every antimalarial market, including frontline drug,
artemisinin. limited understanding plasmodium biology hinders the
elucidation resistance mechanisms. regard, systems biology approaches 
can facilitate integration existing experimental knowledge further
understanding mechanisms.
results: here, developed novel genome-scale metabolic network
reconstruction, ipfal17, asexual blood-stage p. falciparum parasite to
expand understanding metabolic changes support resistance. we
identified 11 metabolic tasks evaluate ipfal17 performance. flux balance
analysis simulation gene knockouts enzyme inhibition predict candidate
drug targets unique resistant parasites. moreover, integration clinical
parasite transcriptomes ipfal17 reconstruction reveals patterns
associated antimalarial resistance. results predict artemisinin
sensitive resistant parasites differentially utilize scavenging and
biosynthetic pathways multiple essential metabolites, including folate and
polyamines. findings consistent experimental literature, while
generating novel hypotheses artemisinin resistance parasite biology. we
detect evidence resistant parasites maintain greater metabolic flexibility, 
perhaps representing incomplete transition metabolic state most
appropriate nutrient-rich blood.
conclusion: using systems biology approach, identify metabolic shifts
that arise support resistant phenotype. perspective allows
us productively analyze interpret clinical expression data the
identification candidate drug targets treatment resistant
parasites.
