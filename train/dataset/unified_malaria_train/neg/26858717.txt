the importance host parasite genetic factors malaria resistance or
susceptibility investigated since middle last century.
nowadays, diseases affect man, malaria still plays one highest
levels selective pressure human genome. susceptibility malaria depends
on exposure profile, epidemiological characteristics, several components of
the innate adaptive immune system influences quality immune
response generated plasmodium lifecycle vertebrate host. it
is well known parasite's enormous capacity genetic variation in
conjunction host genetics polymorphism also associated wide
spectrum susceptibility degrees complicated severe forms disease.
in scenario, variations genes major histocompatibility complex
(mhc) associated host resistance susceptibility malaria been
identified used markers host-pathogen interaction studies, mainly those
evaluating impact immune response, acquisition resistance, or
increased susceptibility infection vulnerability disease. however, due
to intense selective pressure, number cases, mortality rates, the
majority reported associations reported concerned plasmodium falciparum
malaria. studies mhc polymorphism association plasmodium
vivax, widespread plasmodium prevalent species
outside african continent, less frequent equally important. despite
punctual contributions, accumulated evidences human genetic control 
in p. vivax infection disease. herein, review current knowledge the
field mhc derived molecules (hla class i, class ii, tnf-Î±, lta, bat1, 
ctl4) regarding p. vivax malaria. discuss particularly results p. vivax
studies hla class ii polymorphisms relation host susceptibility,
naturally acquired immune response specific antigens implication 
of knowledge overcome parasite immune evasion. finally, potential
impact polymorphisms development vaccine candidate antigens
against p. vivax studied.
