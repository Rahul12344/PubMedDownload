mechanisms drug resistance plasmodium vivax difficult study
partially difficulties culturing parasite vitro. this
hampers monitoring drug resistance research develop evaluate new drugs.
there urgent need novel method study mechanisms p. vivax drug
resistance. paper report development application first 
plasmodium falciparum expression system stably express p. vivax dhfr-ts
alleles. used piggybac transposition system rapid integration of
wild-type, single mutant (117n) quadruple mutant (57l/58r/61m/117t) pvdhfr-ts
alleles p. falciparum genome. majority (81%) integrations
occurred non-coding regions genome; however, levels pvdhfr
transcription driven p. falciparum dhfr promoter different
between integrants non-coding coding regions. integrated quadruple
pvdhfr mutant allele much less susceptible antifolates wild-type 
and single mutant pvdhfr alleles. resistance phenotype stable without
drug pressure. integrated clones susceptible novel antifolate
jpc-2067. therefore, piggybac expression system provides novel and
important tool investigate drug resistance mechanisms gene functions p.
