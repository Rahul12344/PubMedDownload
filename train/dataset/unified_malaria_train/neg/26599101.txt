progress towards genetic sequencing human parasites provided the
groundwork post-genomic approach develop novel antigens the
diagnosis treatment parasite infections. fully utilize genomic
data, however, high-throughput methodologies required functional analysis
of proteins encoded genomic sequences. study, investigated 
cell-free expression situ immobilization parasite proteins novel
platform discovery antigenic proteins. pcr-amplified parasite dna 
immobilized microbeads also functionalized capture synthesized
proteins. microbeads incubated reaction mixture cell-free 
synthesis, proteins expressed microbead-immobilized dna instantly
immobilized microbeads, providing physical linkage the
genetic information encoded proteins. approach situ expression and
isolation enables streamlined recovery analysis cell-free synthesized
proteins also allows facile identification genes coding antigenic
proteins direct pcr microbead-bound dna.
