background: plasmodium ovale widely distributed across tropical regions and
has two closely related distinct species, namely p. ovale curtisi p.
ovale wallikeri. combining genetic characterization immunogenicity of
merozoite surface protein-8 (msp-8) supports considering msp-8 candidate
target blood-stage vaccines malaria. however, previous studies
have focused characterizing genetic diversity immunogenicity of
pomsp-8.
methods: blood samples collected 42 patients infected p. ovale.
the patients migrant workers returning jiangsu province africa; 
genomic dna extracted blood samples sequencing protein
expression. recombinant pomsp-8 (rpomsp-8) proteins expressed and
purified assess immune responses balb/c mice.
results: sequences p. ovale curtisi p. ovale wallikeri msp8 genes 
were completely conserved isolate. rpomsp-8 proteins were
successfully expressed purified ~70Â kda proteins. antibodies raised
against rpomsp-8 mice showed appropriate immunoreactivity, evidenced by
immunoblotting. specific antibodies detected day 7
post-immunization, levels increased throughout whole immunization
period. rpomsp-8-raised antibodies high endpoint titers (1:5,120,000) and
high avidity (pocmsp-8: 94.84%, powmsp-8: 92.69%). cross-reactivity between
rpocmsp-8 rpowmsp-8 observed anti-pomsp8-specific antibody.
conclusions: remarkable conservation high immunogenicity observed both
rpomsp-8s. intriguingly, cross-reaction rpocmsp-8 rpowmsp-8 was
detected, suggesting single pomsp8-based construction might applicable 
for species.
