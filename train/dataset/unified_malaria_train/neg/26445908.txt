background: schistosomiasis considered second malaria most
devastating parasitic disease tropical countries. schistosome cercariae invade
the host penetrating skin migrate though lungs portal
circulation final destination hepatic portal system and
eventually mesenteric veins. previous studies shown cytotoxic
pathways target schistosomulum lung-stage involve nitric oxide (no)
produced macrophages. contrast, skin-stage schistosomulas evade
clearance, indicating might freed macrophage no-mediated
cytotoxicity achieve immune evasion; however, critical molecules and
mechanisms involved remain unknown.
methods: recombinant sjca8 (rsjca8), 8-kda calcium-binding protein is
stage-specifically expressed cercaria early skin-stage schistosomulas of
schistosoma japonicum, incubated mouse raw264.7 macrophages. effects 
macrophage proliferation determined using cell counting kit-8. next,
transwell assay carried investigate role rsjca8 in
macrophage migration. effects rsjca8 macrophage apoptosis were
evaluated using confocal microscopy flow cytometry. additional impacts of
rsjca8 release lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages well
as underlying mechanisms explored using fluorescent probe, nitric oxide 
signaling pathway microarray, quantitative real-time pcr, mutagenesis, and
neutralizing antibody approaches.
results: rsjca8 exhibited striking inhibitory effect macrophage migration,
but markedly increase cell proliferation apoptosis. additionally,
rsjca8 potently inhibited release lps-stimulated macrophages dose- and
time-dependent manner, inhibitory mechanism closely associated with
intracellular ca(2+) levels, up-regulation catalase expression, the
down-regulation expression 47 genes, including myc, gadd45a, txnip,
fas, sod2, nos2, hmgb1. vaccination rsjca8 increased concentration in
the challenging skin area infected mice reduced number migrated
schistosomula skin penetration cercariae.
conclusions: findings indicate sjca8 might novel molecule that
plays critical role immune evasion s. japonicum cercaria the
process skin penetration. inhibitory impacts rsjca8 macrophage
migration [ca(2+)]i-dependent release suggest might represent novel
vaccine candidate chemotherapeutic target prevention treatment of
schistosomiasis.
