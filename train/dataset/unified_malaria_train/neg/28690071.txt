background: plasmodium vivax infection remains major public health problem,
especially along thailand border regions. examined genetic diversity
of parasite analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) the
p. vivax rhomboid-like protease 1 gene (pvrom1) parasites collected from
western (tak province, thai-myanmar border) eastern (chanthaburi province,
thai-cambodia border) regions.
methods: data collected cross-sectional survey, consisting 47 45
p. vivax-infected filter paper-spotted blood samples western eastern
regions thailand, respectively september 2013 may 2014. extracted
dna examined presence p. vivax using plasmodium species-specific
nested pcr. pvrom1 gene pcr amplified, sequenced snp diversity was
analyzed using f-stat, dnasp, mega lian programs.
results: comparison sequences 92 pvrom1 831-base open reading frames
with reference sequence (genbank acc. no. xm001615211) revealed 17
samples total 8 polymorphic sites, consisting singleton (exon 3, nt 
645) parsimony informative (exon 1, nt 22 39; exon 3, nt 336, 537 and
656; exon 4, nt 719 748) sites, resulted six different deduced
pvrom1 variants. non-synonymous synonymous substitutions ratio estimated by
the dnasp program 1.65 indicating positive selection, z-tests of
selection showed significant deviations neutrality pvrom1 samples
from western region thailand. addition mcdonald kreitman test (mk) showed
not significant, fst values different two regions the
regions combined. interestingly, pvrom1 exon 2 conserved
sequences among four exons.
conclusions: relatively high degree pvrom1 polymorphism suggests 
protein important parasite survival face changes insect
vector human populations. polymorphisms could serve sensitive
marker studying plasmodial genetic diversity. significance pvrom1
conserved exon 2 sequence remains investigated.
