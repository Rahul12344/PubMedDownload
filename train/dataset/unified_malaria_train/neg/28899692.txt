besnoitia besnoiti apicomplexan parasite responsible bovine
besnoitiosis, chronic debilitating disease causes systemic skin
manifestations sterility bulls. neither treatments vaccines are
currently available. search therapeutic candidates, calcium-dependent 
protein kinases arisen promising drug targets apicomplexans
(e.g. neospora caninum, toxoplasma gondii, plasmodium spp. eimeria spp.) 
are effectively targeted bumped kinase inhibitors. study, we
identified cloned gene coding bbcdpk1. impact library of
nine bumped kinase inhibitor analogues activity recombinant bbcdpk1 was
assessed luciferase assay. afterwards, screened for
efficacy besnoitiabesnoiti tachyzoites grown marc-145 cells. primary
tests 5µm revealed eight compounds exhibited 90% inhibition 
invasion proliferation. compounds bki 1294, 1517, 1553 1571 were
further characterised, ec99 (1294: 2.38µm; 1517: 2.20µm; 1553: 3.34µm; 1571: 
2.78µm) determined quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in
3-day proliferation assays. exposure infected cultures ec99
concentrations drugs 48h parasiticidal. lack of
parasiticidal action confirmed transmission electron microscopy, which
showed bumped kinase inhibitor treatment interfered cell cycle
regulation non-disjunction tachyzoites, resulting formation of
large multi-nucleated complexes co-existed viable parasites within the
parasitophorous vacuole. however, possible that, face active
immune response, parasite clearance may occur. summary, bumped kinase
inhibitors may effective drug candidates control besnoitiabesnoiti
infection. vivo experiments planned, attainment and
maintenance therapeutic blood plasma levels calves, without toxicity, has
been demonstrated bkis 1294, 1517 1553.
