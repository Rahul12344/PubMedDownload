plasmodium infections responsible millions cases malaria âˆ¼1
million deaths annually. recently, showed sterile protection (95%) in
balb/c mice required plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein
(cs(252-260))-specific memory cd8 cells exceeding threshold 1% all
pbls. importantly, known plasmodium species affect threshold 
cs-specific memory cd8 cells required protection. furthermore, c57bl/6 mice
immunized radiation-attenuated parasites difficult protect
against plasmodium sporozoite challenge similarly immunized balb/c mice;
however, known whether result different cd8 cell
specificity, functional attributes cd8 cells, mouse strain-specific
factors expressed nonhematopoietic cells. article, show more
cs-specific memory cd8 cells required protection p. yoelii
sporozoite challenge protection p. berghei sporozoite challenge.
furthermore, p. berghei cs(252)-specific cd8 cells exhibit reduced protection
against p. berghei sporozoite challenge context c57bl/6 c57bl/10
non-mhc-linked genes cb6f1 b10.d2 mice, respectively. generation and
immunization reciprocal chimeric mice balb/c b10.d2 strains
revealed b10 background factors expressed nonhematopoietic cells
increased threshold required protection cd8 cell-extrinsic
mechanism. finally, reduced cs-specific memory cd8 cell protection p.
yoelii-infected balb/c p. berghei-infected b10.d2 mice correlated with
increased rates plasmodium amplification liver. thus, plasmodium
species strain-specific background genes nonhematopoietic cells determine 
the threshold memory cd8 cells required protection.
