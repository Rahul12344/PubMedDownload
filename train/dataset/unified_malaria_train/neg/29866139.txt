background: cerebral malaria (cm) lethal outcome plasmodium
infection. clear correlations expression inflammatory
cytokines, severe coagulopathies, mortality human cm. however, the
mechanisms intertwining coagulation inflammation pathways, their
roles cm, beginning understood. mice cells deficient 
in regulatory cytokine il-10 (il-10 ko), infection plasmodium chabaudi
leads hyper-inflammatory response lethal outcome prevented
by anti-tnf treatment. however, inflammatory cells adherent within the
vasculature present brain parenchyma, suggesting novel form of
cerebral inflammation. previously documented behavioral dysfunction and
microglial activation infected il-10 ko animals suggestive neurological
involvement driven inflammation. order understand relationship of
intravascular inflammation parenchymal dysfunction, studied congestion 
of vessels leukocytes fibrin(ogen) relationship glial cell
activation congested vessels brains p. chabaudi-infected il-10 ko
mice.
methods: using immunofluorescence microscopy, describe severe thrombotic
congestion animals. stained immune cell surface markers (cd45,
cd11b, cd4), fibrin(ogen), microglia (iba-1), astrocytes (gfap) brain 
at peak behavioral symptoms. finally, investigated roles of
inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (tnf) coagulation the
pathology observed using neutralizing antibodies low-molecular weight heparin
to inhibit inflammation coagulation, respectively.
results: many blood vessels brain congested thrombi containing
adherent leukocytes, including cd4 cells monocytes. despite containment 
the pathogen leukocytes within vasculature, activated microglia and
astrocytes prevalent parenchyma, particularly clustered near vessels 
with thrombi. neutralization tnf, coagulation cascade, significantly
reduced thrombus formation gliosis p. chabaudi-infected il-10 ko
mice.
conclusions: findings support contribution cytokines, coagulation,
and leukocytes within brain vasculature neuropathology malaria
infection. strikingly, localization inflammatory leukocytes within
intravascular clots suggests mechanism interaction two cascades
by cytokines drive local inflammation without considerable cellular
infiltration brain parenchyma.
