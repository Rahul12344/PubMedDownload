fluorescence situ hybridization coupled flow cytometry (fish-flow) a
highly quantitative, high-throughput platform allowing precise quantification 
total mrna transcripts single cells. undiagnosed infections posing a
significant health burden worldwide, latent tuberculosis asymptomatic 
recurrent malaria, important challenge develop accurate diagnostic
tools. antigen-specific cells create persistent memory pathogens, making
them useful diagnosis infection. stimulation memory response initiates 
t-cell transitions functional states. numerous studies shown that
changes protein levels lag real-time t-cell transitions. however, analysis 
the single-cell transcriptional level determine differences. fish-flow is
a powerful tool study functional states t-cell subsets and
to identify gene expression profiles antigen-specific cells during
disease progression. advances instrumentation, fluorophores, fish
methodologies broaden deepen use fish-flow, changing the
immunological field allowing determination functional immune signatures 
the mrna level development new diagnostic tools.
