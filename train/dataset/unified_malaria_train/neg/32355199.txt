the democratic republic congo (drc) harbors 11% global malaria cases,
yet little known spatial genetic structure parasite
population country. sequence 2537 plasmodium falciparum infections,
including nationally representative population sample drc samples from
surrounding countries, using molecular inversion probes - high-throughput
genotyping tool. identify east-west divide haplotypes known confer
resistance chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. furthermore, identify
highly related parasites large geographic distances, indicative gene flow
and migration. results consistent background isolation by
distance combined effects selection antimalarial drug resistance.
this study provides high-resolution view parasite genetic structure across a
large country africa provides baseline study implementation
programs may impact parasite populations.
