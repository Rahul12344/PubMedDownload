nonlinear dynamic processes involving differential regulation of
transcription factors considered impact reprogramming stem cells,
germ cells, somatic cells. here, fused two multinucleate plasmodial cells 
of physarum polycephalum mutants defective different sporulation control genes
while different physiological states. resulting heterokaryons
established one two significantly different expression patterns marker
genes plasmodial halves fused synchronized
spontaneously. spontaneous synchronization suggests switch-like control
mechanisms spread finally control entire plasmodium result of
cytoplasmic mixing. regulatory molecules due large volume the
vigorously streaming cytoplasm define concentrations acting the
population nuclei global setting switches. mixing large
cytoplasmic volume expected damp stochasticity individual nuclei
deliver certain rnas low copy number cytoplasm. conclude that
spontaneous synchronization, damping molecular noise gene expression by
the large cytoplasmic volume, option take multiple macroscopic samples
from plasmodium provide unique options studying dynamics of
cellular reprogramming single cell level.
