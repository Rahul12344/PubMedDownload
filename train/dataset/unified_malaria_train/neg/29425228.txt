kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (kshv) etiological agent kaposi's sarcoma 
(ks). kshv hiv infections endemic uganda, ks among the
most common cancers hiv-infected individuals. recent studies examined use 
of small rnas biomarkers disease, including micrornas (mirnas), viral 
and tumor-derived mirnas detected exosomes individuals with
kshv-associated malignancies. current study, host viral
extracellular mature mirna expression profiles analyzed blood of
ks-negative individuals uganda, comparing without kshv
detectable oropharynx. observed increased levels cellular
oncogenic mirnas decreased levels tumor-suppressor mirnas plasma of
infected individuals exhibiting oral kshv shedding. changes host
oncomirs exacerbated people co-infected hiv, partially reversed 
after 2 years anti-retroviral therapy. also detected kshv mirnas plasma 
of kshv infected individuals determined expression levels
correlated kshv plasma viremia. deep sequencing revealed expected profile
of small cellular rnas plasma, mirnas constituting major rna biotype.
in contrast, composition small rnas exosomes highly atypical with
high levels yrna low levels mirnas. mass spectrometry analysis the
exosomes revealed eleven different peptides derived malaria parasite,
plasmodium falciparum, small rna sequencing confirmed widespread plasmodium
co-infections ugandan cohorts. proteome analysis indicated exosomal
protein profile consistent erythrocyte keratinocyte origins the
plasma exosomes. strong correlation observed abundance of
plasmodium proteins cellular markers malaria. plasmodium falciparum 
an endemic pathogen uganda, study shows co-infection other
pathogens, kshv, severely impact small rna repertoire,
complicating use exosome mirnas biomarkers disease.
