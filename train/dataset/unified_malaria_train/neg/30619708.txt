avian haemosporidian infections widespread result decline of
wild bird populations cases contribute extinction species. we
determined prevalence genetic diversity avian haemosporidia 93
samples 22 landbird species south africa (n = 76) west africa
(n = 17), six intra-african migrants one palearctic
migrant. samples analysed presence avian haemosporidian dna
using real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) nested pcr assays targeting specific 
mitochondrial genes parasites. cytochrome b (cytb) gene was
sequenced samples tested positive phylogenetic analysis was
conducted order determine relationship new sequences with
previously published sequences malavi database. overall prevalence
of avian haemosporidiosis 68.82% (95% ci: 56.4%-78.87%) 82.80% (95% ci:
65.68%-86.11%) determined qpcr nested pcr respectively. eighteen
(19.36%; 95% ci; 10.78%-29.97%) samples mixed infections. infection
prevalence haemosporidian spp. significantly higher (p < 0.05) in
samples west africa. forty-six mitochondrial sequences obtained 14
avian species grouped three distinct clusters haemoproteus (36),
leucocytozoon (8) plasmodium (2). represent eight published nine
new cytb lineages. common lineage haemoproteus sp. (vimwe1) which
was identified two bird species west africa seven bird species from
south africa. study adds knowledge host-parasite relationships 
avian haemosporidia afrotropical birds.
