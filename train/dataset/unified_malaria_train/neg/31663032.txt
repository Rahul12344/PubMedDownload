larval therapy lucilia sericata promising strategy wound healing.
axon guidance molecules play vital roles development nervous
system also regulate capacity neuronal restoration wound healing.
netrin-1, one proteins larvae secrete, plays useful role cell
migration nerve tissue regeneration. unc-5 receptor combines a
netrin-1 signal transmits signal one side membrane the
other side, initiating change cell activity. current study, we
identified full length unc-5 receptor mrna l. sericata using
different sets primers, including exon junction specific region primers.
the coding sequence (cds) unc-5 receptor sequenced identified to
include 633 base-pair nucleic acids, blast analysis nucleotide
sequence revealed 96% identity lucilia cuprina netrin-1 unc-5 receptor. 
the protein residue included 210 amino acids (aa) coded protein 24
kd weight. gene lacked signal peptide. furthermore, upa domain is
conserved unc-5. lied interval 26-131 aa. identified cds
of netrin-1 unc-5 receptor l. sericata. could applied research
activities implementing new essential component design wound healing.
