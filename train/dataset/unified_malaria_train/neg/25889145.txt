background: renewed effort develop novel malaria control strategies
as even well-implemented existing malaria control tools may fail block
transmission regions. currently, transgenic implementations the
sterile insect technique (sit) release insects dominant
lethal, homing endonuclease genes, flightless mosquitoes development.
these implementations involve release transgenic male mosquitoes whose
matings wild females produce either viable offspring female
offspring. technologies infancy, little known 
the relative efficiencies various implementations.
methods: paper describes agent-based modelling emerging theoretical
implementations transgenic sit anopheles gambiae control of
malaria. reports female suppression affected sit
implementation, number released males, competitiveness released
males.
conclusions: simulation experiments suggest late-acting bisex lethal
gene efficient four implementations simulated. they
demonstrate 1) relative impact release size campaign's effectiveness 
2) late-acting genes preferred ability exploit density
dependent larval mortality 3) late-acting bisex lethal genes achieve elimination 
before female-killing counterparts.
