understanding genetic diversity, extent distribution variant forms 
plasmodium vivax parasites crucial development effective control
measures orissa, hyperendemic state eastern part india, the
polymorphic nature p. vivax isolates largely lacking. result the
study analyzing two highly polymorphic single copy genes p. vivax
circumsporozoite protein (pvcs) p. vivax merozoite surface protein 3α
(pvmsp3α) shows parasite population highly heterogenous (33 distinct 
genotype 35 isolates) orissa. however, observation the
multiplicity infection value 1.34 high frequency distribution of
certain genotype respect individual marker (the vk247b allele a
frequency 0.37; vk210e 0.25 vk210c 0.14) suggests the
parasite population likely selective pressure may either be
due preferential production sporozoites carrying variants the
available anopheline mosquito species state selection particular
genotypes host immune pressure. moreover, although p. vivax south-east asia
indicates overall predominance vk210 thought best
adapted variant pvcs repeat type, almost equal prevalence repeat
type pvcs; vk210 vk247 present study unexpected needs
further study clarification.
