malaria mosquito-borne disease affecting millions people every year. 
rodent parasite plasmodium berghei served model human malaria
transmission studies played pivotal role dissecting mosquito immune 
response infection. 6-cysteine protein p47, known important for
p. berghei female gamete fertility, shown serve different function in
plasmodium falciparum, protecting ookinetes mosquito immune response.
here, investigate function p. berghei p47 anopheles gambiae mosquito
infections. show p47 expressed surface female
gametocytes ookinetes serves distinct functions promoting
gametocyte-to-ookinete development protecting ookinetes mosquito
complement-like response, respectively. latter function essential, as
ookinetes lacking p47 targeted killing traversing mosquito
midgut cells eliminated upon exposure hemolymph proteins the
complement-like system. silencing key factors complement-like system
restores oocyst development disease transmission rodent hosts. data
establish dual role p. berghei p47 vivo reinforce use this
parasite study impact mosquito immune response human malaria
transmission.
