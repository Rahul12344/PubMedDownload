malarial rhythmic fevers consequence synchronous bursting red

here, hypothesized intrinsic clock parasite plasmodium chabaudi
underlies 24-hour-based rhythms rbc bursting mice. show that
parasite rhythms flexible lengthen match rhythms hosts with
long circadian periods. also show malaria rhythms persist even host 
food intake evenly spread across 24 hours, suggesting host feeding cues
are required synchrony. moreover, find parasite population
remains synchronous rhythmic even arrhythmic clock mutant host. thus,
we propose parasite rhythms generated parasite, possibly to
anticipate circadian environment.
