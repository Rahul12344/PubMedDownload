background: despite development malaria control programs, billions of
people still risk infectious disease. recently, idea the
transmission-blocking vaccine, works interrupting infection of
mosquitoes parasites, gained attention promising strategy malaria
control eradication. date, limited number surface proteins 
identified mosquito-stage parasites investigated potential targets 
transmission-blocking vaccines. therefore, development effective
transmission-blocking strategies epidemic areas, necessary identify
novel zygote/ookinete surface proteins candidate antigens.
methods: since expression many zygote/ookinete proteins regulated
post-transcriptionally, proteins regulated well-known translational
mediators focused. silico screening, cpw-wpc family proteins were
selected potential zygote/ookinete surface proteins. experiments were
performed rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium yoelii xnl. mrna protein
expression profiles examined rt-pcr western blotting, respectively,
over course life cycle malaria parasite. protein function was
also investigated generation gene-disrupted transgenic parasites.
results: cpw-wpc protein family, named unique wxc repeat domains,
is highly conserved among plasmodium species. revealed cpw-wpc mrna
transcripts transcribed gametocytes, cpw-wpc proteins expressed 
in zygote/ookinete-stage parasites. localization analysis reveals one the
cpw-wpc family members, designated pycpw-wpc-1, novel zygote/ookinete
stage-specific surface protein. targeted disruption pycpw-wpc-1 gene
caused obvious defects ookinete oocyst formation, suggesting that
pycpw-wpc-1 essential mosquito-stage parasite development.
conclusions: demonstrated pycpw-wpc-1 classified novel,
post-transcriptionally regulated zygote/ookinete surface protein. additional
studies required determine whether cpw-wpc family members also
present ookinete surface share similar biological roles during
mosquito-stage parasite development. investigations cpw-wpc family
proteins may facilitate understanding parasite biology mosquito stage
and development transmission-blocking vaccines.
