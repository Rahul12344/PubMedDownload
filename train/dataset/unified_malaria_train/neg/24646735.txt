characteristic features plasmodium falciparum malaria polyclonal b cell
activation altered composition blood b cell compartment, including 
expansion cd21(-)cd27(-) atypical memory b cells. baff key cytokine b 
cell homeostasis, potential contribution modulation blood b
cell pool malaria remains elusive. controlled human malaria model
(chmi) malaria-naive dutch volunteers, therefore examined dynamics of
baff induction b cell subset activation composition, investigate
whether changes linked malaria-induced immune activation and, in
particular, induction baff. alterations b cell composition chmi
closely resembled observed endemic areas. found distinct
kinetics proliferation individual b cell subsets across developmental 
stages. proliferation peaked either immediately blood-stage infection at
convalescence, subsets directly associated peak
parasitemia. concomitantly, plasma baff levels chmi increased and
correlated membrane-expressed baff monocytes dendritic cells, well
as blood-stage parasitemia parasite-induced ifn-γ. correlating increased
plasma baff ifn-γ levels, igd(-)cd38(low)cd21(-)cd27(-) atypical b cells
showed strongest proliferative response memory b cell subsets. this
provides unique evidence link malaria-induced immune activation and
temporary expansion b cell subset. finally, baseline baff-r levels before
chmi predictive subsequent changes proportions individual b cell
subsets. findings suggest important role baff facilitating b cell 
subset proliferation redistribution consequence malaria-induced
immune activation.
