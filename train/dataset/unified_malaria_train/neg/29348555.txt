malaria fever pervasive quite tropical developing regions
causing high morbidity mortality. causal organism protozoan parasite
of genus plasmodium spreads human host bite hitherto
infected female anopheles mosquito. course biting, salivary protein
of anopheles helps blood feeding behavior ability elicit the
host immune response. study represents series immunoinformatics
approaches design multi-epitope subunit vaccine using anopheles mosquito
salivary proteins. designed subunit vaccine evaluated immunogenicity,
allergenicity physiochemical parameters. enhance stability vaccine 
protein, disulfide engineering performed region high mobility. codon 
adaptation silico cloning also performed ensure higher
expression designed subunit vaccine e. coli k12 expression system. finally,
molecular docking simulation study performed vaccine protein 
tlr-4 receptor, determine binding free energy complex stability.
moreover, designed subunit vaccine found induce anti-salivary immunity
which may ability prevent entry plasmodium sporozoites into
the human host.
