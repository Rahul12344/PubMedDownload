nuclear factor 90 (nf90) dual dna- rna-binding protein expressed
ubiquitously mammalian cells, including monocytes. here, elucidate the
function nf90 immune response, analyzed systematically influence
on gene expression programs human monocytic cell line thp-1 expressing
normal reduced nf90 levels. rna sequencing analysis revealed many mrnas
showing differential abundance nf90-silenced cells, many encoding
proteins implicated response immune stimuli malaria infection. 
transcription (e.g. tnf, lilrb1, ccl2 mrnas) modulated by
silencing nf90. ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (rip) analysis further
revealed subset mrnas associated directly nf90. to
understand nf90 influenced globally immune response malaria infection,
lysates red blood cells infected plasmodium falciparum (irbc lysates) 
uninfected/mock-infected (urbc lysates) used treat thp-1 cells a
surrogate malaria infection. nf90 affected stability target
mrnas, influenced generally translation secretion encoded
cytokines treatment either urbc irbc lysates. taken together, these
results indicate nf90 contributes repressing immune response cells
responding p. falciparum infection suggest nf90 therapeutic 
target malaria.
