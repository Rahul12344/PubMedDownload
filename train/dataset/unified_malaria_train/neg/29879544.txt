aging accompanied imbalanced bone remodeling, elevated osteocyte apoptosis,
and decreased bone mass mechanical properties; improved pharmacologic
approaches counteract bone deterioration aging needed. examined
herein effect mefloquine, drug used treat malaria systemic lupus 
erythematosus shown ameliorate bone loss glucocorticoid-treated
patients, bone mass mechanical properties young old mice. young
3.5-month-old old 21-month-old female c57bl/6 mice received daily injections 
of 5 mg/kg/day mefloquine 14 days. aging resulted expected changes 
bone volume mechanical properties. old mice mefloquine administration
reversed lower vertebral cancellous bone volume bone formation; had
modest effects cortical bone volume, thickness, moment inertia.
mefloquine administration change levels circulating bone
formation markers p1np alkaline phosphatase, whereas levels resorption 
marker ctx showed trends towards increase mefloquine treatment. addition,
and expected, aging bones exhibited accumulation active
caspase3-expressing osteocytes higher expression apoptosis-related genes
compared young mice, altered mefloquine administration at
either age. young animals, mefloquine induced higher periosteal bone
formation, lower endocortical bone formation. further, osteoclast numbers
were higher endocortical bone surface circulating ctx levels were
increased, mefloquine- compared vehicle-treated young mice. consistent with
this, addition mefloquine bone marrow cells isolated young mice led to
increased osteoclastic gene expression tendency towards increased
osteoclast numbers vitro. taken together findings identify age and
bone-site specific skeletal effects mefloquine. further, results highlight
a beneficial effect mefloquine administration vertebral cancellous bone
mass old animals, raising possibility using pharmacologic
inhibitor preserve skeletal health aging.
