community prevalence infection widely used, standardized metric for
evaluating malaria endemicity. conventional methods measuring prevalence
include light microscopy rapid diagnostic tests (rdts), detection
thresholds inadequate diagnosing low-density infections. significance
of submicroscopic malaria infections poorly understood madagascar, a
country heterogeneous malaria epidemiology. cross-sectional community survey
in western foothills madagascar march 2014 transmission season 
found malaria infection predominantly submicroscopic asymptomatic.
prevalence plasmodium infection diagnosed microscopy, rdt, molecular
diagnosis 2.4%, 4.1%, 13.8%, respectively. diagnostic discordance
was greatest plasmodium vivax infection, 98.5% submicroscopic.
village location, insecticide-treated bednet ownership, fever were
significantly associated infection outcomes, presence another
infected individual household. duffy-negative individuals diagnosed
with p. vivax, reduced odds relative duffy-positive hosts. the
observation high proportions submicroscopic infections calls wider
assessment parasite reservoir regions island, particularly
given country's current focus malaria elimination poorly
documented distribution non-p. falciparum parasite species.
