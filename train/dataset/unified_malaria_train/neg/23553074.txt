we applied, first time, next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology on
egyptian mummies. seven ngs datasets obtained five randomly selected third
intermediate graeco-roman egyptian mummies (806 bc-124ad) two unearthed
pre-contact bolivian lowland skeletons generated characterised. the
datasets contrasted three recently published ngs datasets obtained from
cold-climate regions, i.e. saqqaq, denisova hominid alpine
iceman. analysis done using one million reads newly generated or
published dataset. blastn megablast results analysed using megan
software. distinct ngs results replicated specific sensitive
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) protocols ancient dna dedicated laboratories. 
here, provide unambiguous identification authentic dna egyptian mummies.
the ngs datasets showed variable contents endogenous dna harboured tissues.
three five mummies displayed human dna proportion comparable human
read count saqqaq permafrost-preserved specimen. furthermore, a
metagenomic signature unique mummies displayed. applying "bacterial
fingerprint", discrimination among mummies remains warm areas
outside egypt possible. due absence adequate environment
monitoring, bacterial bloom identified analysing different biopsies
from mummies taken lapse time 1.5 years. plant kingdom
representation mummy datasets unique could partially associated
with use embalming materials. finally, ngs data showed presence of
plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii dna sequences, indicating malaria and
toxoplasmosis mummies. demonstrate endogenous ancient dna be
extracted mummies serve proper template ngs technique,
thus, opening new pathways investigation future genome sequencing of
ancient egyptian individuals.
