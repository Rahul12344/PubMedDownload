many mosquito species serve vectors diseases malaria yellow
fever, wherein pathogen transmission tightly associated reproductive 
requirement taking vertebrate blood meals. toxorhynchites one three
known mosquito genera host-seek initiates egg development in
the absence blood-derived protein bolus. remarkable differences make
toxorhynchites attractive comparative reference understanding mosquito
chemosensation pertains host-seeking. performed deep transcriptome
profiling adult female toxorhynchites amboinensis bodies, antennae and
maxillary palps, identified 25,084 protein-coding "genes" de novo
assembly. phylogenomic analysis 4,266 single-copy "genes" t. amboinensis,
aedes aegypti, anopheles gambiae, culex quinquefasciatus robustly supported
ae. aegypti closest relative t. amboinensis, two species
diverged approximately 40 ma. identified large number t. amboinensis
chemosensory "genes," majority orthologs mosquitoes.
finally, cross-species expression analyses indicated patterns of
chemoreceptor transcript abundance similar chemoreceptors 
conserved t. amboinensis ae. aegypti, whereas t. amboinensis appeared
deficient variety expressed, lineage-specific chemoreceptors. our
transcriptome assembly t. amboinensis represents first comprehensive
genomic resource nonblood-feeding mosquito establishes foundation for
future comparative studies blood-feeding nonblood-feeding mosquitoes. we
hypothesize chemosensory genes display discrete patterns evolution
and abundance t. amboinensis blood-feeding mosquitoes likely to
play critical roles host-seeking hence vectorial capacity.
