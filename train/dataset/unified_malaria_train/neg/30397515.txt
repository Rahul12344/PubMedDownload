artemether-lumefantrine (al) artesunate-amodiaquine (as-aq) most
commonly used artemisinin-based combination therapies (act) treatment of
plasmodium falciparum africa. treatments remain efficacious, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance
1 (pfmdr1) gene may compromise sensitivity. al as-aq exert opposing selective
pressures: parasites genotype 86y, y184 1246y partially resistant to
as-aq treatment, n86, 184 f d1246 favoured al treatment. through
a systematic review, identified 397 surveys measuring prevalence pfmdr1
polymorphisms positions 86 184 1246 30 countries africa. temporal
trends snp frequencies introduction al as-aq first-line
treatment analysed 32 locations, selection coefficients estimated. we
examined associations antimalarial policies, consumption, transmission
intensity rate snp selection. 1246y frequency decreased average more
rapidly locations national policy recommended al (median selection
coefficient(s) -0.083), compared policies as-aq al as-aq
(median s=-0.035 0.021, p<0.001 respectively). 86y frequency declined

more rapid decline countries al policies (p=0.055). however, trends

broad increase sensitivity parasites as-aq, 7-10 years al
