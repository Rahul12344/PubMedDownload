we evaluated clinical efficacy artesunate-mefloquine (asmq) fixed-dose
combination treat uncomplicated malaria juruá valley, main plasmodium
falciparum transmission hotspot brazil. november 2010 february
2013, enrolled 162 patients aged 4-73 years, fever history fever,
and single-species p. falciparum infection confirmed microscopy and
polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 154 patients completed 42-day
follow-up presented adequate clinical parasitologic response. asmq was
well tolerated adverse event caused treatment interruption. gametocytes
were detected 46.3% patients; 35.2% gametocytes enrollment, whereas
others developed patent gametocytemia 1-14 days starting asmq. day 3 
treatment, subjects cleared asexual parasitemia, parasite dna
remained pcr detectable 37.6% them. day-3 pcr positivity associated
with prolonged gametocyte carriage. found molecular evidence resistance 
to either mq (pfmdr1 gene amplification) (mutations selected kelch13
gene domains known associated resistance) local p.
falciparum population. results strongly support use asmq a
first-line regimen treat uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria northwestern
brazil, underscore need gametocytocidal drugs reduce the
transmission potential asmq-treated patients (clinicaltrials.gov number
nct01144702).
