ir-tex application written shiny (an r package) allows exploration 
of expression (as well assigning functions to) transcripts whose
expression associated insecticide resistance phenotypes anopheles
gambiae mosquitoes. application used online downloaded used
locally anyone. local application modified add new insecticide
resistance datasets generated multiple -omics platforms. guide
demonstrates add new datasets handle missing data. furthermore, ir-tex
can completely easily recoded use-omics datasets experimental 
data, making valuable resource many researchers. protocol illustrates
the utility ir-tex identifying new insecticide resistance candidates using 
the microsomal glutathione transferase, gstms1, example. this
transcript upregulated multiple pyrethroid resistant populations c√¥te
