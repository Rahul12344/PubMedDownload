background: efforts control malaria demanding due drug-resistant
parasites, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes poor health infrastructure in
malaria-endemic countries. therefore, research development additional 
malaria control methods crucial. host-parasite interactions, surface
antigens secreted proteins likely involved infectivity and
invasion host tissues therefore effective targets control by
vaccines, drug therapy, novel mosquito control methods. effort to
identify characterize genes may role host-parasite
interaction, study describes expression profile plasmodium falciparum
pf3d7_1363700.
methods: p. falciparum gene, pf3d7_1363700, identified search the
annotated plasmodium genome database. protein alignments pf3d7_1363700
orthologues various plasmodium species performed demonstrate protein
similarity. transcript expression profiles pf3d7_1363700 determined via
reverse-transcriptase pcr protein expression investigated by
immunofluorescence assays, western blot analysis green fluorescent
trafficking studies.
results: pf3d7_1363700 protein demonstrates significant similarity with
orthologues plasmodium species appears unique to
apicomplexans. pf3d7_1363700 transcription profile demonstrated expression
during intra-erythrocytic, oocyst sporozoite, salivary gland sporozoite
stages pf3d7_1363700 protein detected the
intra-erythrocytic stages.
conclusions: research utilized silico approach identify a
well-conserved protein known pf3d7_1363700. molecular, biochemical and
cellular analyses, pf3d7_1363700 discovered an
intra-erythrocytic-specific stage protein unique apicomplexans.
