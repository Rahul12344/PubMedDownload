malaria causes approximately 212 million cases 429 thousand deaths annually. 
plasmodium falciparum responsible vast majority deaths (99%) than
others. virulence p. falciparum mostly associated immune
response-evading ability. different mechanisms evade anopheles
mosquito human host immune responses. immune-evading mechanisms mosquito
depend mainly pfs47 gene inhibits janus kinase-mediated activation.
host complement factor also protects human complement immune attack of
extracellular gametes anopheles mosquito midgut. human host, evasion
largely results antigenic variation, polymorphism, sequestration. they
also induce kupffer cell apoptosis preerythrocytic stage interfere
with phagocytic functions macrophage hemozoin erythrocytic stage.
lack major histocompatibility complex-i molecule expression surface red
blood cells also avoids recognition cd8+ cells. complement proteins could
allow entry parasite red blood cell. intracellular survival
also assists escape malarial parasite. invading, evading, immune
response mechanisms malaria vector human host critical design 
appropriate vaccine. result, receptors ligands involved different
stages malaria parasites elucidated.
