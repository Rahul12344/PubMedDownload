sickle cell disease (scd), caused mutation β-globin gene hbb, is
widely distributed malaria endemic regions. cardiopulmonary complications 
major causes morbidity mortality. hemoglobin ss (hb ss) represents large
proportion scd americas, united kingdom, certain regions africa 
while higher proportions hemoglobin sc observed burkina faso and
hemoglobin sβ-thalassemia greece india. coinheritance α-thalassemia and
persistence hemoglobin f production observed highest frequency in
certain regions india middle east. confirmed push and
walk-phasst studies, hb ss, absence co-inheriting alpha-thalassemia, low
hemoglobin f levels tend associated hemolysis, lower hemoglobin
oxygen saturations, greater proportions elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet
velocity brain natriuretic peptide, increased left ventricular mass
index. identification additional genetic modifiers improve prediction 
cardiopulmonary complications scd.
