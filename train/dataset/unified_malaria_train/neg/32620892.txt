the genomes plasmodium spp. encode number different multigene families
that thought play critical role survival. however, the
exception p. falciparum var genes, little known the
biological roles multigene families. using recently
developed selection linked integration method, able activate 
expression single member multigene family choice plasmodium
spp. endogenous promoter. demonstrate usefulness approach
by activating expression unique var, rifin stevor p. falciparum
as well yir p. yoelii. characterization selected parasites reveals
differences different families terms mutual exclusive control, 
co-regulation, host adaptation. results support application
of approach study multigene families plasmodium other
organisms.
