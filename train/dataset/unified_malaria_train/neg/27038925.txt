background: transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) promising strategy for
malaria control elimination. however, candidate tbv antigens currently
limited, highlighting urgency identifying new antigens tbv
development.
methods: using combination bioinformatic analysis functional studies 
the rodent malaria model plasmodium berghei, identified conserved plasmodium
protein pbph (pbanka_041720) containing pleckstrin homology (ph) domain. the
expression pbph detected western blot indirect immunofluorescence
assay (ifa). function pbph tested genetic knockout. tb activity
was confirmed vitro ookinete conversion assay mosquito feeding.
results: pbph detected western blot highly expressed sexual stages
(gametocytes ookinetes). ifa revealed localizations pbph surface of
gametes, zygotes, ookinetes. deletion pbph gene affect asexual
growth, significantly reduced formation gametocytes, ookinetes, and
oocysts, indicating pbph protein required parasite sexual
development. recombinant pbph expressed purified bacteria elicited
strong antibody responses mice antibodies significantly inhibited
exflagellation male gametocytes formation ookinetes a
concentration-dependent manner. mosquito feeding experiments confirmed that
mosquitoes fed mice immunized pbph 13 % reduction prevalence
of infection almost 48 % reduction oocyst density.
conclusions: pbph highly conserved plasmodium gene required for
parasite sexual development. pbph protein expressed surface gametes 
and ookinetes. immunization mice recombinant pbph protein induced 
strong antibody responses effectively reduced formation male gametes 
and ookinetes vitro blocked transmission parasites mosquitoes.
these results highlight pbph potential tbv candidate worth future
investigations human malaria parasites.
