the duffy (fy) antigens act receptors chemokines well plasmodium
vivax invade human rbcs. recent study correlated occurrence the
fy*a allele duffy gene decreased susceptibility vivax malaria, 
epidemiological correlation distribution fy*a allele and
incidences vivax malaria established far. furthermore, such
correlations exist, whether natural selection mediated association, an
important question. since india highly endemic p. vivax malaria with
variable eco-climatic varying vivax malaria epidemiology across different
regions, question could well answered indians. this, have
genotyped fy gene -33(rd) 125(th) nucleotide positions 250 
indians sampled six different zonal plus one tribal population covering 
whole india studied possible correlations eco-climatic vivax
malaria incidences. fy*o allele found, however, fy*a fy*b
alleles forming fy*a/fy*a, fy*a/fy*b fy*b/fy*b genotypes widely
distributed among indians. five seven population samples significantly
deviated hardy-weinberg equilibrium expectation, two alleles (fy*a
and fy*b) homozygote genotype, fy*b/fy*b clinically distributed over
the population coordinates. furthermore, vivax malaria incidences past
five years significantly negatively positively associated the
frequencies fy*a fy*b alleles, respectively. northern indians were
highly differentiated zonal population samples fy gene, 
evidenced reconstructed neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. results 
specify role natural selection distribution fy gene polymorphism
in india. furthermore, hypotheses part fy*a allele in
conferring protection vivax malaria could validated following population
genetic studies vivax malaria epidemiological setting, india.
