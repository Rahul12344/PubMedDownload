plasmodium spp. haemosporidian protozoans alternate live cycles
between bloodsucking culicidae dipterans vertebrate hosts (mammals, reptiles,
and birds). birds, parasites causative agents so-called
avian malaria, disease associated considerable declines extinctions in
the avifauna different geographical regions. work, applied a
multidisciplinary approach, light microscopy cytochrome oxidase b (cyt b)
gene sequence analysis, characterization plasmodium spp. found in
association wild birds genus turdus, collected atlantic forest
fragments southeastern brazil. total 90 analyzed birds, 58 (47 turdus
rufiventris, 9 turdus leucomelas, 1 turdus albicollis, 1 turdus flavipes)
were positively infected plasmodium unalis, haemosporidian was
previously detected turdus fuscater colombia penguins brazil, but
has never found association turdus species present
work. moreover, 7 new sequences p. unalis cyt b gene clustered a
monophyletic clade previously characterized p. unalis sequences mean 
genetic divergence 1.6% maximum divergence 3.1%, indicating 
a high degree intraspecific polymorphism within parasitic species.
together, data highlight existence high degree intraspecific
variation within p. unalis highlight importance integrative taxonomy
to accurate identification characterization avian haemosporidian
parasites.
