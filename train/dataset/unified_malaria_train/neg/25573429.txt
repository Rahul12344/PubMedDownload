the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum possesses sophisticated systems 
of protein secretion modulate host cell invasion remodeling. the
present study, provide insights function ap-1 complex p.
falciparum. utilized gfp fusion constructs live cell imaging, well as
fixed parasites immunofluorescence analysis, study adaptor protein mu1
(pfμ1) mediated protein trafficking p. falciparum. trophozoites pfμ1 showed
similar dynamic localization several golgi/er markers, indicating
golgi/er localization. treatment transgenic parasites brefeldin altered
the localization golgi-associated pfμ1, supporting localization studies.
co-localization studies showed considerable overlap pfμ1 resident
rhoptry proteins, rhoptry associated protein 1 (rap1) cytoadherence linked
asexual gene 3.1 (clag3.1) schizont stage. immunoprecipitation experiments
with pfμ1 pfrap1 revealed interaction, may mediated an
intermediate transmembrane cargo receptor. specific role pfμ1 in
trafficking suggested treatment alf4, resulted shift 
predominantly er-associated compartment consequent decrease in
co-localization golgi marker grasp. together, results suggest a
role ap-1 complex rhoptry protein trafficking p. falciparum.
