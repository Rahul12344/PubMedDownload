as plasmodium parasite transitions mammalian mosquito host, it
has adjust quickly new environments. palmitoylation, reversible and
dynamic lipid post-translational modification, plays central role regulating
this process implicated functions parasite morphology,
motility host cell invasion. proteins associated gliding
motility machinery described palmitoylated, palmitoyl
transferase responsible regulating gliding motility previously been
identified. here, characterize two palmityol transferases gene tagging
and gene deletion approaches. identify dhhc3, palmitoyl transferase, a
mediator ookinete development, crucial role gliding motility in
ookinetes sporozoites, co-localize protein marker the
inner membrane complex ookinete stage. ookinetes sporozoites lacking
dhhc3 impaired gliding motility exhibit strong phenotype vivo;
with ookinetes significantly less infectious mosquito host and
sporozoites non-infectious mice. importantly, genetic complementation of
the dhhc3-ko parasite completely restored virulence. generated parasites
lacking dhhc3, well palmitoyl transferase dhhc9, found an
enhanced phenotype double knockout parasites, allowing insights into
the functional overlap compensational nature large family pbdhhcs. 
these findings contribute understanding organization mechanism 
of gliding motility machinery, becoming increasingly clear, is
mediated palmitoylation.
