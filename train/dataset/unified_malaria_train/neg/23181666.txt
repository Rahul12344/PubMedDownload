background: post-genomic era malaria research provided unprecedented
insights biology plasmodium parasites. due large evolutionary 
distance model eukaryotes, however, lack profound understanding many
processes plasmodium biology. one example cell nucleus, controls 
the parasite genome development- cell cycle-specific manner through
mostly unknown mechanisms. study important organelle detail, we
conducted integrative analysis p. falciparum nuclear proteome.
results: combined high accuracy mass spectrometry bioinformatic approaches
to present first time experimentally determined core nuclear proteome 
for p. falciparum. besides large number factors implicated known nuclear 
processes, one-third detected proteins carry functional annotation,
including many phylum- genus-specific factors. importantly, extensive
experimental validation using 30 transgenic cell lines confirmed high
specificity inventory, revealed distinct nuclear localization
patterns hitherto uncharacterized proteins. further, detailed analysis
identified novel protein domains potentially implicated gene transcription
pathways, sheds important new light nuclear compartments processes
including regulatory complexes, nucleolus, nuclear pores, nuclear import 
pathways.
conclusion: study provides comprehensive new insight biology 
plasmodium nucleus serve important platform dissecting general
and parasite-specific nuclear processes malaria parasites. moreover, the
first nuclear proteome characterized protist organism, provide 
important resource studying evolutionary aspects nuclear biology.
