background: deforestation amazon social vulnerability its
settler communities associated increased malaria incidence. the
feeding biology important malaria vectors region, notably
nyssorhynchus darlingi, compounds efforts control vectors reduce
transmission become known "frontier malaria". exploring
anophelinae mosquito diversity fundamental understanding species
responsible transmission developing appropriate management and
intervention strategies malaria control amazon river basin.
methods: study describes anophelinae mosquito diversity settler
communities affected frontier malaria states acre, amazonas and
rondônia analysing coi gene data using cluster tree-based species
delimitation approaches.
results: total, 270 specimens collection sites sequenced these
were combined 151 reference (genbank) sequences analysis assist in
species identification. conservative estimates found number species
collected sites 23 (mptp partition) 27 (strict abgd
partition) species, 13 appeared new. nyssorhynchus
triannulatus nyssorhynchus braziliensis displayed exceptional levels of
intraspecific genetic diversity was little support putative
species complex status.
conclusions: study demonstrates anophelinae mosquito diversity
continues underestimated poorly sampled areas frontier malaria 
a major public health concern. findings help shape future studies of
vector incrimination transmission dynamics areas support efforts
to develop effective vector control transmission reduction strategies in
settler communities amazon river basin.
