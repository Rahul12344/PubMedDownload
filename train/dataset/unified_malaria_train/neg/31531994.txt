translational control regulates levels protein synthesized its
transcript key rapid adjustment gene expression response 
environmental stimuli. regulation translation special importance for
malaria parasites, pass complex life cycle includes various 
replication phases different organs human mosquito hosts 
sexual reproduction phase mosquito midgut. particular, quiescent
transmission stages rely translational control rapidly adapt new
environment, switch human mosquito vice versa.
three control mechanisms currently proposed plasmodium, (1) global
regulation acts translation initiation complex; (2) mrna-specific
regulation, involving cis control elements, mrna-binding proteins and
translational repressors; (3) induced mrna decay ccr4-not rna 
exosome complex. main molecules controlling translation highly conserved 
in malaria parasites increasing number studies shed light the
interwoven pathways leading downregulation protein synthesis in
the diverse plasmodial stages. highlight recent findings translational
control life cycle progression plasmodium discuss molecules
involved regulating protein synthesis.
