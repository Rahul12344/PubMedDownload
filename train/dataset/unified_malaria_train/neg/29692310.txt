plasmodium falciparum gametocytes develop 9-12 days sequestered in
deep tissues. emergence bloodstream, circulate varied
amounts time certain host factors might influence further
development. aimed evaluate potential association patient clinical
parameters gametocyte development carriage via vivo methods.
seventy-two patients enrolled three hospitals volta region of
ghana 2016. clinical parameters documented patients, and
gametocyte prevalence microscopy estimated 12.5%. measuring rna
transcripts representing two distinct gametocyte developmental stages using
reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr), we
obtained precise estimate gametocyte carriage also inferring
gametocyte maturation. fifty-three percent study participants harbored
parasites expressing transcripts immature gametocyte-specific gene
(pf3d7_1477700), whereas 36% harbored pf3d7_1438800 rna-positive parasites, which
is enriched mid mature gametocytes, suggesting presence more
immature stages. linear logistic regression showed patients older 5
years less 16 years likely carry gametocytes expressing
both pf3d7_1477700 pf3d7_1438800 compared younger participants, and
gametocytemia likely mildly anemic individuals compared those
with severe/moderate anemia. data provide evidence greater
number malaria patients harbor gametocytes typically estimated by
microscopy suggest possible association age, fever, anemia, and
gametocytemia.
