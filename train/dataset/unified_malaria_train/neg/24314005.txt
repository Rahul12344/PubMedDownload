background: emergence pyrethroid resistance malaria vector,
anopheles arabiensis, threatens undermine considerable gains made towards 
eliminating malaria zanzibar. previously, resistance restricted the
island pemba mosquitoes unguja, larger two islands of
zanzibar, susceptible. here, characterised mechanism(s) responsible
for resistance zanzibar using combination gene expression target-site
mutation assays.
methods: resistance bioassays conducted using 1-5d old adult anopheles
gambiae s.l. collected 2011 2013 across archipelago. synergist
assays p450 inhibitor piperonyl-butoxide performed 2013. members
of an. gambiae complex pcr-identified screened target-site
mutations (kdr ace-1). gene expression pyrethroid resistant an. arabiensis
from pemba analysed using whole-genome microarrays.
results: pyrethroid resistance present across entire zanzibar
archipelago. survival pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin bioassays conducted
in 2013 23.5-54.3% unguja 32.9-81.7% pemba. present evidence
that resistance mediated, part least, elevated p450 monoxygenases.
whole-genome microarray scans showed enriched gene terms in
resistant an. arabiensis pemba associated p450 activity and
synergist assays pbo completely restored susceptibility pyrethroids in
both islands. cyp4g16 consistently over-expressed gene resistant 
mosquitoes compared two susceptible strains unguja dar es salaam.
expression p450 enriched abdomen thought play a
role hydrocarbon synthesis. microarray qpcr detected several additional
genes putatively involved pathway enriched pemba pyrethroid
resistant population hypothesise resistance may be, part, related 
to alterations structure mosquito cuticle. none kdr
target-site mutations, associated pyrethroid/ddt resistance an. gambiae
elsewhere africa, found islands.
conclusion: consequences resistance phenotype discussed in
relation future vector control strategies zanzibar support ongoing
malaria elimination efforts islands.
