the inflammasomes control bioactivity pro-inflammatory cytokines the
interleukin (il)-1 family. inflammasome assembled nlrp3 been
predominantly studied homogeneous cell populations in vitro, neglecting the
influence cellular interactions occur in vivo. here, show that
platelets boost inflammasome capacity human macrophages neutrophils
and critical il-1 production monocytes. platelets license nlrp3
transcription, thereby enhancing asc oligomerization, caspase-1 activity, and
il-1β secretion. platelets influence il-1β production in vivo, blood platelet
counts correlate plasmatic il-1β levels malaria. furthermore, reveal
an enriched platelet gene signature among highest-expressed transcripts in
il-1β-driven autoinflammatory diseases. platelet effect independent of
cell-to-cell contact, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids,
and host platelet cytokines, involves triggering of
calcium-sensing receptors macrophages. hence, platelets provide additional 
layer regulation inflammasomes il-1-driven inflammation.
