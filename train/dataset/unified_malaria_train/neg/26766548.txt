background: characterizing parasite dynamics population structure
provides useful information understand dynamic transmission to
better target control interventions. despite considerable efforts its
control, vivax malaria remains major health problem peru. study, 
have explored population genetics plasmodium vivax isolates iquitos, 
the main city peruvian amazon, 25 neighbouring peri-urban well as
rural villages along iquitos-nauta road.
methodology/ results: april december 2008, 292 p. vivax isolates were
collected successfully genotyped using 14 neutral microsatellites. analysis
of molecular data revealed similar proportion monoclonal polyclonal 
infections urban areas, rural areas monoclonal infections were
predominant (p = 0.002). multiplicity infection higher urban (moi =
1.5-2) compared rural areas (moi = 1) (p = 0.003). level genetic
diversity similar areas (he = 0.66-0.76, p = 0.32) though genetic
differentiation areas substantial (phipt = 0.17, p<0.0001). principal
coordinate analysis showed marked differentiation parasites urban 
and rural areas. linkage disequilibrium detected areas ([formula: 
see text] = 0.08-0.49, p<0.0001). gene flow among areas was
stablished bayesian analysis migration models. recent bottleneck
events detected 4 areas recent parasite expansion one the
isolated areas. total, 87 unique haplotypes grouped 2 3 genetic clusters
described sub-structured parasite population.
conclusion/significance: study shows sub-structured parasite population
with clonal propagation, components recently affected by
bottleneck events. iquitos city main source parasite spreading 
the peripheral study areas. routes transmission gene flow the
reduction parasite population described important public
health perspective well formulation future control policies.
