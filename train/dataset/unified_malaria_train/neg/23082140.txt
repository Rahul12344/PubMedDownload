background: pyruvate kinase (pk) deficiency, causing hemolytic anemia, been
associated malaria protection prevalence sub-saharan africa 
known far. work shows results study undertaken determine pk
deficiency occurrence sub-saharan african countries, well finding a
prevalent pk variant underlying deficiency.
materials methods: blood samples individuals four malaria endemic
countries (mozambique, angola, equatorial guinea sao tome principe) 
analyzed order determine pk deficiency occurrence detect possible
high frequent pk variant mutation. association mutation and
malaria ascertained association studies involving sample groups 
individuals showing different malaria infection outcome status.
results: percentage individuals showing reduced pk activity maputo
was 4.1% missense mutation g829a (glu277lys) pklr gene (only
identified three individuals worldwide date) identified high
frequency. heterozygous carrier frequency 6.7% 2.6%. a
significant association detected either pk reduced activity or
allele 829a frequency malaria infection outcome, although variant was
more frequent among individuals uncomplicated malaria.
conclusions: first study occurrence pk deficiency in
several areas africa. common pklr mutation g829a (glu277lys) identified.
a global geographical co-distribution malaria high frequency pk
deficiency seems occur suggesting malaria may selective force
raising frequency 277lys variant.
