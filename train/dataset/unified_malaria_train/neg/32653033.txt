background: plasmodium falciparum-resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp)
has largely reported among pregnant women. however, profile of
resistance markers sp dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) general population varied frequently
monitored. currently, sp used partner drug artemisinin combination
therapy (sp-artesunate) sub-saharan african countries a
prophylactic drug intermittent preventive treatment malaria during
pregnancy infants seasonal malaria chemoprevention (smc). profiling of
p. falciparum-resistant genotypes sp dynamic critical providing data
that would useful malaria control programmes. study assessed the
profile dhfr dhps genes genotypes among individuals malaria lagos,
nigeria.
methods: molecular markers sp resistance identified nested pcr and
sequenced among malaria positive dried blood spots (dbs) collected from
individuals attending health facilities january 2013 february 2014 and
during community surveys october 2010 september 2011 across different
local government areas lagos state, nigeria.
results: total 242 167 samples sequenced dhfr dhps,
respectively. sequence analysis dhfr showed 95.5% (231/242), 96.3%
(233/242) 96.7% (234/242) samples n51i, c59r s108n mutant
alleles, respectively. prevalence dhps mutation codons a437g, a613s,
s436a, a581g, i431v k540e 95.8% (160/167), 41.9% (70/167), 41.3%
(69/167), 31.1% (52/167), 25.1% (42/167), 1.2% (2/167) respectively. the
prevalence triple mutations (cirni) dhfr 93.8% 44.3% single
dhps haplotype mutation (sgkaa). partial sp-resistance due quadruple dhfr-dhps
haplotype mutations (cirni-sgkaa) octuple haplotype mutations (cirni-vagkgs) 
with rate 42.6% 22.0%, respectively reported.
conclusions: increased prevalence dhfr triple haplotype mutations
when compared previous reports environment aligned high
prevalence locations nigeria countries africa. also,
high prevalence dhfr dhps mutant alleles occurred study areas in
lagos, nigeria five eight years introduction artemisinin
combination therapy underscores need continuous monitoring.
