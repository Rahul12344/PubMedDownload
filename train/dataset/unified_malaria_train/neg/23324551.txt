background: subtelomeric multigene families malaria parasites encode virulent 
determinants. published genome sequence plasmodium vivax revealed the
largest subtelomeric multigene family human malaria parasites, vir
super-family, presently composed 346 vir genes subdivided 12 different
subfamilies based sequence homologies detected blast.
results: novel computational approach used redefine vir genes. first, 
protein-weighted graph built based blast alignments. graph was
processed ensure edge weights exclusively based blast
score two corresponding proteins, strongly dependant their
graph neighbours associations. markov clustering algorithm was
applied protein graph. next, homology block concept used to
further validate clustering approach. finally, proteome-wide analysis was
carried predict new vir members. results showed (i) three previous
subfamilies cannot longer classified vir genes; (ii) previously
unclustered vir genes clustered vir subfamilies; (iii) 39 hypothetical 
proteins predicted vir proteins; (iv) many findings are
supported number structural functional evidences, sub-cellular
localization studies, gene expression analysis chromosome localization (v)
this approach used study multigene families malaria.
conclusions: methodology, resource new classification vir genes 
contribute new structural framing multigene family other
multigene families malaria parasites, facilitating design experiments
to understand role pathology, turn may help furthering vaccine 
development.
