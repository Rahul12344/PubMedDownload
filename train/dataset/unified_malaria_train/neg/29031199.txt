artesunate (art) semi-synthetic derivative artemisinin used
preferentially treatment malaria china. art strong
anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic properties. although the
pharmacological effect art osteoarthritis (oa) unknown, evidence
suggests art might regulate osteoclastogenesis nf-κb signaling. in
this study explored therapeutic effect art anterior cruciate
ligament transection (aclt)-induced oa model. found art effectively
relieved aclt-induced osteoarthritis, demonstrated improvement
expression pathological genes. demonstrated art markedly
reduced oa-associated osteoclastogenesis angiogenesis. addition, art also 
regulated inflammatory response inhibited activation janus
kinase/signal transducers activators transcription (jak/stat) signaling in
aclt rats. taken together study identified novel function art and
provided molecular basis art potential applications treatment oa 
and joint disorders.
