conventional control strategies mosquito-borne pathogens malaria 
dengue complemented development transgenic mosquito
strains reprogrammed generate beneficial phenotypes conditional
sterility pathogen resistance. widespread success site-specific
nucleases transcription activator-like effector nucleases (talens) and
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/cas9 model 
organisms also suggests reprogrammable gene drive systems based these
nucleases may capable spreading beneficial phenotypes wild mosquito
populations. using mosquito aedes aegypti, determined mutations in
the foki domain used talens generate obligate heterodimeric complexes
substantially significantly reduce gene editing rates. found that
crispr/cas9-based editing mosquito ae. aegypti also highly variable,
with majority guide rnas unable generate detectable editing. first
evaluating candidate guide rnas using transient embryo assay, able to
rapidly identify highly effective guide rnas; focusing germ line-based
experiments cohort resulted consistently high editing rates of
24-90%. microinjection double-stranded rnas targeting ku70 lig4, both
essential components end-joining response, increased recombination-based
repair early embryos determined plasmid-based reporters. rnai-based
suppression ku70 concurrent embryonic microinjection site-specific
nucleases yielded consistent gene insertion frequencies 2-3%, similar to
traditional transposon- Ï†c31-based integration methods without the
requirement initial docking step. studies greatly accelerate 
investigations mosquito biology, streamline development transgenic
strains field releases, simplify evaluation novel cas9-based gene 
drive systems.
