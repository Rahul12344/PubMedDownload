plasmodium development within mosquito vector essential step malaria
transmission, illustrated world regions malaria successfully
eradicated via vector control. innate immune system mosquitoes is
able completely clear plasmodium infection, preventing parasite transmission
to humans. understanding biological basis phenomenon expected to
inspire new strategies curb malaria incidence countries vector
control via insecticides unpractical, inefficient insecticide
resistance genes spread across mosquito populations. several aspects of
mosquito biology condition success parasite colonizing its
vector begin understood molecular level, wealth recently
published data highlights multifaceted nature mosquito response
against parasite invasion. brief review, attempt provide an
integrated view challenges faced parasite successfully invade
its mosquito host, discuss possible intervention strategies could
exploit knowledge fight human malaria.
