plasmodium falciparum merozoites use diverse alternative erythrocyte receptors
for invasion variably express cognate ligands encoded erythrocyte
binding antigen (eba) reticulocyte binding-like homologue (rh) gene families.
previous analyses conducted parasites single populations areas of
endemicity revealed wide spectrum invasion phenotypes expression
profiles, although comparisons across studies limited use of
different protocols. direct comparisons within among populations,
clinical isolates three different west african sites endemicity (in
ghana, guinea, senegal) cryopreserved cultured ex vivo thawing
in single laboratory assay invasion target erythrocytes pretreated with
enzymes affecting receptor subsets. complete invasion assay data 67 isolates
showed differences among populations broad range phenotypes
measured neuraminidase treatment (overall mean, 40.6% inhibition) trypsin
treatment (overall mean, 83.3% inhibition). effects chymotrypsin treatment
(overall mean, 79.2% inhibition) showed heterogeneity across populations
(kruskall-wallis p = 0.023), although full phenotypic range seen each.
schizont-stage transcript data panel 8 invasion ligand genes (eba175,
eba140, eba181, rh1, rh2a, rh2b, rh4, rh5) obtained 37 isolates,
showing similar ranges variation population except eba175 levels 
tended higher parasites ghana senegal (whereas
levels eba181 rh2b lower parasites ghana). broad
diversity invasion phenotypes gene expression seen within local
population, minimal differences among them, consistent hypothesis 
of immune selection maintaining parasite variation.
