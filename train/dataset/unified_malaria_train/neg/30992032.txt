background: mosquito-borne diseases affect millions worldwide, malaria alone
killing 400 thousand people per year affecting hundreds millions. 
date, best strategy prevent disease remains insecticide-based mosquito
control. however, insecticide resistance well economic social factors
reduce effectiveness current methodologies. alternative control
technologies development, including genetic control sterile
insect technique (sit). sit pivotal tool integrated agricultural pest
management could used improve malaria vector control. apply sit 
and newer technologies disease transmitting mosquitoes, 
essential releases composed males minimal female contamination. 
the removal females essential requirement released females can
themselves contribute towards nuisance biting disease transmission. thus,
females need eliminated cohorts prior release. manual
separation anopheles gambiae pupae adult mosquitoes based morphology 
time consuming, feasible large scale limited the
implementation sit technique. doublesex (dsx) gene one the
effector switches sex determination process sex differentiation in
insects. males females specific splicing variants are
expressed across different life stages. using rna interference (rnai) to
reduce expression female specific (dsxf) variant gene proven
to detrimental effects females mosquito species, as
aedes aegypti. tested oral rnai dsx (agdsxf) an. gambiae.
methods: studied expression pattern dsx gene an. gambiae g3 
strain. knocked agdsxf expression larvae oral delivery of
double stranded rna (dsrna) produced bacteria observed effects in
adults.
results: results show feeding agdsxf dsrna effectively reduce
(> 66%) mrna female dsx transcript concomitant
reduction number female larvae achieve adulthood. control groups
produced 52% (± 3.9% se) adult males 48% (± 4.0% se) females, agdsxf
dsrna treated groups 72.1% (± 4.0% se) males vs 27.8% females (± 3.3% se). in
addition, female adults produce fewer progeny, 37.1% (± 8.2% se) less than
the controls. knockdown sex-specific impact total numbers
of viable male adults, male dsx transcripts male fitness parameters
such longevity body size.
conclusions: findings indicate rnai could used improve novel
mosquito control strategies require efficient sex separation male-only
release an. gambiae targeting sex determination genes agdsxf. the
advantages using rnai controlled setting mosquito rearing are
numerous, dose time exposure controlled, possibility of
off-target effects waste female production would significantly
reduced.
