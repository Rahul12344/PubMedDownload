background: declining anti-malarial efficacy artemisinin-based combination
therapy, reduced plasmodium falciparum susceptibility individual
anti-malarials documented across expanding area southeast asia
(sea). genotypic markers complement phenotypic studies assessing efficacy 
of individual anti-malarials.
methods: markers pfmdr1 pfcrt genotyped parasite samples obtained
in 2011-2014 14 trac (tracking resistance artemisinin collaboration) sites 
in mainland southeast asia using combination pcr next-generation
sequencing methods.
results: pfmdr1 amplification, marker mefloquine lumefantrine
resistance, highly prevalent mae sot thailand-myanmar border (59.8%
of isolates) common (more 10%) sites central myanmar, eastern
thailand western cambodia; however, prevalence lower previously 
documented pailin, western cambodia. pfmdr1 y184f mutation common,
particularly around cambodia, f1226y mutation found about
half samples mae sot. functional significance two mutations
remains unclear. previously documented pfmdr1 mutations absent very
rare region. pfcrt mutation k76t associated chloroquine
resistance found 98.2% isolates. cviet haplotype made 95% or
more isolates western sea cvidt haplotype common (30-40% of
isolates) north northeastern cambodia, southern laos, southern
vietnam.
conclusions: findings generate cause concern regarding mid-term
efficacy artemether-lumefantrine myanmar, absence of
resistance-conferring pfmdr1 mutations svmnt pfcrt haplotypes suggests that
amodiaquine could efficacious component anti-malarial regimens sea.
