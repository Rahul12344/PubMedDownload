host transcriptional responses high- low-virulent avian malaria parasites.

the transcriptional response hosts genetically similar pathogens vary
substantially, important implications disease severity host fitness.
a low pathogen load theoretically elicit high low host responses, as
the outcome depends effectiveness host suppressing the
pathogen ability pathogen evade immune system. here, we
investigate transcriptional response eurasian siskins (spinus spinus) to
two closely related lineages malaria parasite plasmodium relictum. birds
were infected either high-virulent lineage p. relictum sgs1, the
low-virulent sister lineage p. relictum grw4, sham-injected (controls). blood 
samples rna sequencing collected four time points course
of infection, totaling 76 transcriptomes 19 birds. hosts infected sgs1 
experienced 87% parasitemia major transcriptome shifts throughout the
infection, multiple genes showed strong correlation parasitemia. in
contrast, grw4-infected hosts displayed low parasitemia (maximum 0.7%) a
minor transcriptional response. furthermore demonstrate baseline gene
expression levels hosts prior infection irrelevant immunocompetence
markers, could predict future pathogen load. study shows that
the magnitude host transcriptional response differ markedly from
related parasites different virulence, enables better understanding
of molecular interactions taking place hosts parasites.
