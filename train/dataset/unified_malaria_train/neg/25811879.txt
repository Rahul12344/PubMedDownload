we report study genome-wide, dense snp (âˆ¼ 900k) copy number polymorphism
data indigenous southern africans. demonstrate genetic contribution 
southern eastern african populations, involved admixture between
indigenous san, niger-congo-speaking populations eurasian ancestry. this
finding illustrates need account stratification genome-wide
association studies, admixture mapping would likely successful
approach populations. developed strategy detect signature of
selection prior following putative admixture events. several genomic
regions show unusual excess niger-kordofanian, unusual deficiency of
both san eurasian ancestry, considered footprints selection
after population admixture. several snps strong allele frequency differences
were observed predominantly admixed indigenous southern african
populations, ancestral eurasian populations. interestingly, many
candidate genes, identified within genomic regions showing signals
for selection, associated southern african-specific high-risk, mostly
communicable diseases, malaria, influenza, tuberculosis, human
immunodeficiency virus/aids. observation suggests potentially important
role genes might played adapting environment.
additionally, analyses haplotype structure, linkage disequilibrium,
recombination, copy number variation genome-wide admixture highlight, and
support unique position san relative african non-african
populations. study contributes better understanding population
ancestry selection south-eastern african populations; data and
results obtained support research genetic contributions to
infectious well non-communicable diseases region.
