background: sulphadoxine pyrimethamine anti-folate drugs show
synergistic anti-malarial effect. point mutations dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) dihydropteorate synthatase (dhps) cause anti-folate drug resistance
phenotype human malaria parasites. study presents pattern point
mutations dhfr/dhps genes among indian sub-continent.
methods: microscopically diagnosed one hundred plasmodium vivax field isolates
were collected five widely separated geographical regions india. dhfr and
dhps genes pcr amplified sequenced. previously published mutations data 
were collected analyzed using chi square test identify geographical
cluster mutant/wild type genotypes.
results: sequence analysis revealed single (s58r), double (s58r/s117n) and
quadruple (f57l/s58r/t61m/s117t/) point mutations dhfr single (a383g) to
double (a383g/a553g) mutations dhps p. vivax field isolates. addition,
three new mutations also observed dhfr. both, dhfr dhps genes
revealed tandem repeat variations field isolates. dhps revealed low
mutation frequency (14.0%) compared dhfr (50.70%). comparative analysis
revealed progressive increase frequency quadruple mutant dhfr genotype
(p<0.001) within five years north-eastern state (kamrup, assam). frequency 
dhfr genotypes revealed three distinct geographical clusters wild (northern
india), double mutant (southern india), quadruple mutant (north-eastern and
island regions india) indian sub-continent.
conclusion: study suggests sp may susceptible p. vivax india,
except andaman north-eastern state. distinction geographical regions
with sensitive resistant parasite phenotypes would highly useful for
designing administering national anti-malarial drug policy.
