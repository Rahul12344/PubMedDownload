the introduction transgenes plasmodium falciparum, highly virulent
human malaria parasite, conducted either single crossover
recombination using episomal plasmids. however, techniques remain
insufficient low transfection efficiency low frequency 
recombination. improve genetic manipulation p. falciparum, developed
the centromere plasmid new genetic tool. first, attempted clone of
the predicted centromeres p. falciparum e. coli cells failed
because high a/t contents sequences. overcome difficulty,
we identified common sequence features centromere plasmodium spp.
and designed small centromere retained features. centromere
plasmid constructed small centromere sequence, pfcen, segregated into
daughter parasites approximately 99% efficiency, resulting stable
maintenance plasmid p. falciparum even absence drug
selection. result demonstrated small centromere sequence harboured 
in pfcen could function actual centromere p. falciparum. addition,
transgenic parasites rapidly generated using pfcen using
the control plasmid, contain centromere sequence. furthermore, 
in contrast control plasmid, pfcen form concatemers and, thus, was
maintained single copy multiple cell divisions. unique properties
of pfcen plasmid solve current technical limitations genetic 
manipulation p. falciparum, thus, plasmid become standard
genetic tool study parasite.
