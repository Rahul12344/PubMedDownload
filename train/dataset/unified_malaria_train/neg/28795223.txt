the goal study design single tube pcr test detection and
differentiation babesia species dna samples obtained diverse
biological materials. multiplex, single tube pcr test designed for
amplification approximately 400Â bp region babesia 18s rrna gene.
universal primers designed match dna multiple babesia spp. have
low levels similarity dna sequences intracellular protozoa and
babesia hosts. pcr products amplified babesia dna isolated human,
dog, rodent, deer, tick samples subjected high-resolution melting
analysis babesia species identification. designed test allowed detection 
and differentiation four babesia species, three zoonotic (b. microti, b.
divergens, b. venatorum) one generally considered
zoonotic-babesia canis. detection identification four species
were possible based hrm curves pcr products samples obtained
from following: humans, dogs, rodents, ticks. cross-reactivity with
dna babesia hosts plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii observed.
the lack cross-reactivity p. falciparum dna might allow using assay
in endemic malaria areas. designed assay first pcr-based test for
detection differentiation several babesia spp. medical veterinary
importance, single tube reaction. results study show the
designed assay babesia detection identification could practical 
inexpensive tool diagnostics screening studies diverse biological
materials.
