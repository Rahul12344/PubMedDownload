toll-like receptors (tlrs) play important role regulating immune responses 
during pathogen infection. however, roles tlrs cells reside the
mesenteric lymph node (mln) fully elucidated course s.
japonicum infection. study, lymphocytes mesenteric lymph node 
(mln) s. japonicum-infected mice isolated expression roles of
tlr2, tlr3, tlr4, tlr7 cd4+ cd8+ cells compared. found 
that expression tlr7 increased mln cells s.
japonicum-infected mice, particularly cd4+ cd8+ cells (p < 0.05). r848, 
a tlr7 agonist, could enhance production ifn-γ mln cells of
infected mice (p < 0.05), especially cd8+ cells (p < 0.01). tlr7 gene
knockedout (ko) mice, s. japonicum infection caused significant decrease (p
< 0.05) expression cd25 cd69, well production ifn-γ
and il-4 inducted pma plus ionomycin cd4+ cd8+ cells.
furthermore, decreased level ifn-γ il-4 supernatants sea- or
swa-stimulated mesenteric lymphocytes detected (p < 0.05). results
indicated s. japonicum infection could induce tlr7 expression cells
in mln c57bl/6 mice, tlr7 mediates cell response early phase 
of infection.
