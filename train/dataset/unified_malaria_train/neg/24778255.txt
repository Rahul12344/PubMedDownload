mosquito salivary glands important roles blood feeding pathogen
transmission. however, biological relevance many salivary components has
yet determined. aegyptin, secreted salivary protein aedes aegypti,
binds collagen inhibits platelet aggregation adhesion. used a
transgenic approach study relevance aegyptin mosquito blood feeding.
aedes aegypti manipulated genetically express gene-specific inverted-repeat
rna sequences exhibited significant reductions aegyptin mrna accumulation
(85-87%) protein levels (>80-fold) female mosquito salivary glands.
transgenic mosquitoes longer probing times (78-300 s, p < 0.0001) when
feeding mice compared controls (15-56 s), feeding success reduced,
and feeding took smaller blood meals. however, differences feeding
success blood meal size found membrane feeding experiments using
defibrinated human blood. salivary gland extracts transgenic mosquitoes
failed inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation vitro. reductions of
aegyptin affect salivary adp-induced platelet aggregation inhibition or
disturb anticlotting activities. results demonstrate relevance of
aegyptin a. aegypti blood feeding, providing support the
hypothesis platelet aggregation inhibition vital salivary function in
blood feeding arthropods. suggested multiple mosquito
salivary components mediating platelet aggregation (i.e., aegyptin, apyrase, d7) 
represent functional redundancy. findings support hypothesis;
instead, indicate multiple salivary components work synergistically and
are necessary achieve maximum blood feeding efficiency.
