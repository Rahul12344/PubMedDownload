immunization attenuated whole plasmodium sporozoites constitutes promising
vaccination strategy. compared replication-deficient parasites, immunization
with replication-competent parasites confers better protection also induces a
type ifn (ifn-1) response, whether ifn-1 response beneficial or
adverse effects vaccine-induced adaptive immunity known. here, show 
that ifn-1 signaling-deficient mice immunized replication-competent
sporozoites exhibit superior protection infection. correlates with
superior cd8 cell memory including reduced expression exhaustion markers
pd-1 lag-3 cells increased numbers memory cd8 cells 
liver. moreover, adoptive transfer memory cd8 cells livers of
previously immunized ifn-1 signaling-deficient mice confers greater protection
against liver stage parasites. however, the detrimental role ifn-1 signaling
is cd8 cell intrinsic. together, data demonstrate liver
stage-engendered ifn-1 signaling impairs hepatic cd8 cell memory via cd8 t
cell-extrinsic mechanism.
