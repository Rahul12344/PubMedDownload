during blood-stage plasmodium infection, large-scale invasion rbcs often
occurs generation cellular immune responses. plasmodium berghei 
anka (pba)-infected c57bl/6 mice, cd4(+) cells controlled parasite numbers
poorly, instead providing early help pathogenic cd8(+) cells. expression
analysis revealed transcriptional signature cd4(+) cells from
pba-infected mice dominated type ifn (ifn-i) ifn-γ-signalling
pathway-related genes. role ifn-i blood-stage plasmodium infection
had yet established. here, observed ifn-α protein production the
spleen pba-infected c57bl/6 mice first 2 days infection. mice
deficient ifn-i signalling reduced parasite burdens, displayed none of
the fatal neurological symptoms associated pba infection. ifn-i
substantially inhibited cd4(+) t-bet(+) t-cell-derived ifn-γ production, and
prevented emerging th1 response controlling parasites. experiments
using bm chimeric mice revealed ifn-i signalled predominantly via
radio-sensitive, haematopoietic cells, suppress cd4(+) cells via
direct signalling cell type. finally, found ifn-i suppressed
ifn-γ production, hampered efficient control parasitaemia mice infected
with non-lethal plasmodium chabaudi. thus, elucidated novel regulatory 
pathway primary blood-stage plasmodium infection suppresses cd4(+)
t-cell-mediated parasite control.
