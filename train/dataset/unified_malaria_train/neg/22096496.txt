despite clear public health benefit insecticide-treated bednets (itns),
the impact malaria transmission-reduction vector control spread of
drug resistance well understood. present study, effect of
sustained transmission reduction itns prevalence plasmodium
falciparum gene mutations associated resistance antimalarial drugs
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) chloroquine (cq) children age 
five years investigated itn trial asembo area, western kenya.
during itn trial, national first line antimalarial treatment changed from
cq sp. smear-positive samples collected cross sectional surveys prior 
itn introduction (baseline, n = 250) five years post-itn intervention (year 5
survey, n = 242) genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) at
dhfr-51, 59, 108, 164 dhps-437, 540 (sp resistance), pfcrt-76 and
pfmdr1-86 (cq resistance). association drug resistance mutations 
and epidemiological variables evaluated. significant increases 
the prevalence sp dhps mutations dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant, a
significant reduction proportion mixed infections detected dhfr-51, 
59 dhps-437, 540 snps baseline year 5 survey. change
in high prevalence pfcrt-76 pfmdr1-86 mutations. multivariable
regression analysis showed current antifolate use year survey
were significantly associated sp drug resistance mutations. these
results suggest increased antifolate drug use due drug policy change
likely led high prevalence sp mutations 5 years post-itn intervention
and reduced transmission apparent effect existing high prevalence
of cq mutations. evidence current study sustained
transmission reduction itns reduces prevalence genes associated with
malaria drug resistance.
