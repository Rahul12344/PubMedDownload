salivary gland proteins adult female anopheles barbirostris species a2, a
potential vector plasmodium vivax thailand, analyzed using proteomic
approach (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed nanolc-ms).
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed approximately 75 well-resolved spots
on reference gel. protein spots displayed relative molecular
masses 14 85 kda isoelectric points ranging 3.9 10. the
proteome profiles a. barbirostris species a2 female salivary glands were
affected aging. typical electrophoretic pattern female salivary
glands reached 48 h post emergence, suggesting maturation salivary 
glands saliva contents blood feeding. proteins involved blood feeding,
i.e., putative 5' nucleotidase/apyrase, anti-platelet protein, long form d7
salivary protein, d7-related 1 protein, gsg6 salivary protein, start to
accumulate emergence gradually increase becoming predominant within 48
h. different salivary components expressed within region the
female glands. blood-feeding proteins detected distal-lateral
lobes and/or medial lobes. proteins detected and/or identified approach
could tested strategies developed control pathogen disease
transmission. moreover, information 2d map female salivary gland 
could used comparison related species a. barbirostris
complex distinguish species members complex.
