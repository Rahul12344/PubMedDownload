we previously showed treatment mice flt3 ligand (flt3l) prevents
development lethal experimental cerebral malaria inhibits parasitemia
during plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection. study, investigated
the mechanisms underlying reduction parasitemia flt3l-treated mice.
studies using gene knockout mice antibody treatment indicated the
anti-parasitemia effect flt3l mediated innate immune system was
dependent myd88, ifn-γ, il-12 natural killer (nk) cells. number nk 
cells ability produce ifn-γ enhanced flt3l-treated mice.
phagocytic activity splenocytes increased flt3l-treated mice pba 
infection compared untreated mice, activity mainly
mediated accumulation f4/80(mid) cd11b(+) cells spleen. 
myd88(-/-) ifn-γ(-/-) mice, proportion f4/80(mid) cd11b(+) cells was
not increased spleen flt3l-treated mice infection. these
correlations suggest nk cells produce ifn-γ flt3l-treated mice, and
accumulation f4/80(mid) cd11b(+) cells spleen promoted ifn-γ
-dependent manner, culminating inhibition parasitemia. findings
imply flt3l promotes effective innate immunity malaria infection
mediated interplay among varieties innate immune cells.
