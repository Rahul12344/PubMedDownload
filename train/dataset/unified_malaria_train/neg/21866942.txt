decoquinate single-digit nanomolar activity vitro blood stage
plasmodium falciparum parasites, causative agent human malaria. vitro
evolution decoquinate-resistant parasites subsequent comparative genomic
analysis drug-sensitive parental strain revealed resistance conferred 
by two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms gene encoding
cytochrome b. resultant amino acid mutations, a122t y126c, reside within 
helix c ubiquinol-binding pocket cytochrome b, essential subunit 
the cytochrome bc(1) complex. cytochrome bc(1) inhibitors, 
atovaquone, decoquinate low nanomolar activity vitro liver stage
p. yoelii provides partial prophylaxis protection administered to
infected mice 50 mg kg(-1). addition, transgenic parasites expressing yeast
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase >200-fold less sensitive decoquinate, which
provides additional evidence drug inhibits parasite's mitochondrial
electron transport chain. importantly, decoquinate exhibits limited
cross-resistance panel atovaquone-resistant parasites evolved harbor
various mutations cytochrome b. basis difference revealed 
molecular docking studies, inhibitors shown have
distinctly different modes binding within ubiquinol-binding site of
cytochrome b.
