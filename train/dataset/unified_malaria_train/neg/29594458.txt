malaria remains deadly parasitic disease caused plasmodium, claiming almost 
half million lives every year. parasite genetics biology often
the major targets many studies, becoming evident host genetics
plays crucial role outcome infection. similarly, plasmodium
infections mice also rely heavily genetic background mice, and
often correlate observations human studies, due high genetic
homology humans. such, murine models malaria useful tool for
understanding host responses plasmodium infections, well dissecting 
host-parasite interactions various genetic manipulation techniques.
reverse genetic approach quantitative trait loci studies random
mutagenesis screens employed discover novel host genes affect
malaria susceptibility mouse models, targeted studies utilize
mouse models validate observation human studies. herein, review the
findings past present studies murine models hepatic and
erythrocytic stages malaria speculate current mouse models
benefit recent development crispr/cas9 gene editing technology.
