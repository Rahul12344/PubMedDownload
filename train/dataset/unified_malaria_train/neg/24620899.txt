background: plasmodium falciparum aetiological agent malaria, deadly
infectious disease vaccine yet licensed. proteins
displayed merozoite cell surface long considered attractive
vaccine targets direct exposure host antibodies; however,
progress understanding functional role targets hindered 
by technical challenges associated expressing proteins a
functionally active recombinant form. address this, method enables 
systematic expression functional extracellular plasmodium proteins was
previously developed, used create library 42 merozoite proteins.
methods: compile comprehensive library recombinant proteins
representing repertoire p. falciparum merozoite extracellular proteins for
systematic vaccine functional studies, genome-wide expression profiling was
used identify additional candidates. candidate proteins recombinantly
produced integrity expression levels tested western
blotting elisa.
results: twenty-five additional genes upregulated late
schizogony, predicted encode secreted cell surface proteins, were
identified expressed soluble recombinant proteins. band consistent 
the entire ectodomain observed immunoblotting majority the
proteins expression levels quantified. using sera from
malaria-exposed immune adults, immunoreactivity 20 recombinant proteins
was assessed, merozoite ligands found carry heat-labile
epitopes. facilitate systematic comparative studies across entire library,
multiple plasmodium proteins simultaneously purified using custom-made
platform.
conclusions: library recombinant p. falciparum secreted cell surface
proteins expanded 20 additional proteins, shown express at
usable levels contain conformational epitopes. resource extracellular
p. falciparum merozoite proteins, contains 62 full-length ectodomains, 
will valuable tool elucidating function proteins 
blood stages infection, facilitate comparative assessment blood
stage vaccine candidates.
