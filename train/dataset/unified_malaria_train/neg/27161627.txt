dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) known sulfa drug target malaria
treatment, existing bifunctional enzyme together with
hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (hppk). polymorphisms key
residues plasmodium falciparum dhps (pfdhps) characterized and
linked sulfa drug resistance malaria. genetic sequencing p. vivax dhps
(pvdhps) clinical isolates shown several polymorphisms positions 
equivalent pfdhps genes conferring sulfa drug resistance,
suggesting mechanism sulfa drug resistance p. vivax similar seen
in p. falciparum characterize role polymorphisms pvdhps sulfa
drug resistance, various mutants recombinant pvhppk-dhps enzymes were
expressed characterized. moreover, due lack continuous vitro
culture system p. vivax parasites, surrogate p. berghei model expressing
pvhppk-dhps genes established demonstrate relationship between
sequence polymorphisms sulfa drug susceptibility test activities
of pvdhps inhibitors transgenic parasites. enzyme activity and
transgenic parasite growth sensitive sulfadoxine different degrees,
depending number mutations accumulated dhps. ki values 50% 
effective doses higher mutant pvdhps enzymes wild-type enzymes.
altogether, study provides first evidence sulfa drug resistance the
molecular level p. vivax furthermore, enzyme inhibition assay in
vivo screening system useful tools screening new compounds their
activities pvdhps.
