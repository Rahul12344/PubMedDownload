plasmodium cynomolgi malaria parasite typically infects asian macaque
monkeys, humans rare occasions. p. cynomolgi serves model system 
the human malaria parasite plasmodium vivax, shares important 
biological characteristics formation dormant liver stage preference
to invade reticulocytes. genomes three p. cynomolgi strains been
sequenced, genetic diversity p. cynomolgi widely investigated. to
address developed first panel p. cynomolgi microsatellite markers 
to genotype eleven p. cynomolgi laboratory strains 18 field isolates from
sarawak, malaysian borneo. found diverse genotypes among the
laboratory strains, though two nominally different strains found be
genetically identical. also investigated sequence polymorphism two
erythrocyte invasion gene families, reticulocyte binding protein duffy
binding protein genes, strains. also observed copy number variation
in rbp genes.
