objectives lupus classical systemic autoimmune disease genetics one 
of well known causative factors disease pathogenesis. toll-like
receptors major pattern recognition receptors associated innate
immunity also act interface adaptive immunity. genetic
polymorphisms genes encoding tlrs implicated development of
infections, malignancies autoimmune diseases. tlr9 member tlr family,
and recognizes cpg dna motifs pathogens. though incidence rate of
lupus asians reported low (30 - 50/100,000 population), poor disease
prognosis due higher incidence renal complications aggressive disease
worsens scenario. ability tlr9 detect elicit immune response
against double-stranded dna makes tlr9 relevant factor tested its
association clinical serological phenotypes lupus. however, lack 
of relevant genetic data normative frequencies tlr9 (rs187084)
polymorphism may serve constraint derive sample size conduct case 
control association studies. hence study conducted establish the
normative frequency tlr9 (rs187084) polymorphism indian tamils. materials
and methods tlr9 (rs187084) polymorphism screened south indian tamils 
( n = 208) pcr-rflp. results discussion observed higher occurrence of
the mutant allele (65%) south indian tamils. gender disparity respect 
to mutant allele frequency observed. higher incidence mutant
allele genders suggests population undergone genetic
selection pressure evolutionary genetic measure withstand prevailing
endemic infections like tb malaria. though enhanced expression tlr9
was protective infections, may also influence development of
autoimmune diseases. conclusion higher incidence thetlr9 (rs187084)
over-expression mutation indian tamils suggestive genetic adaptation
or selection pressure withstand prevailing endemic infectious and
parasitic diseases. however, genetic adaptation poses greater risk to
develop autoimmune diseases like sle etc complex gene environment
interactions. normative frequency tlr9 (rs187084) polymorphism
established population could used define sample size for
future case control studies.
