background: plasmodium falciparum merozoites free invasive forms invade 
host erythrocytes iterative cycles presence different arms the
immune system. variant antigens known play role immune evasion and
several gene families coding variant antigens identified p.
falciparum. however, none reported expressed the
surface merozoites.
methods: flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting assays
were performed assess surface exposure, membrane association stage
specific expression stevor family variants proteins, respectively.
results: using polyclonal antibody (anti-pfl2610w) broad specificity
towards different stevor variants, stevor proteins identified the
surface non-permeabilized/non-fixed merozoites flow cytometry assays.
anti-pfl2610w antibody showed several stevors expressed the
trophozoite stage parasite one variant integrated the
merozoite membrane. moreover, antibody failed identify stevors the
surface parent schizont infected erythrocytes (ie) although were
readily identified schizont ie permeabilized.
conclusions: data suggest role stevor immune evasion p.
falciparum merozoites allow successful invasion erythrocytes. additionally,
the expression stevors schizont stage may represent step 
biogenesis process merozoite surface coat.
