background: rodent malaria models extensively used predict treatment
outcomes human infections. constant need improve refine
these models innovating ways apply new scientific findings cutting edge
technologies. addition, accordance three r's animal use 
research, vivo studies constantly refined avoid unnecessary pain 
and distress experimental animals using preemptive euthanasia soon
as main scientific study objective accomplished.
methods: new methodology described manuscript uses whole-body
bioluminescence signal emitted transgenic, luciferase-expressing plasmodium
berghei parasites assess parasite load predicted parasitaemia (plpp) in
drug control treated female icr-cd1 mice infected 1 × 105
luciferase-expressing p. berghei (anka strain) infected erythrocytes. this
methodology replace time-consuming expensive methods are
routinely used measure parasitaemia infected animals, as
giemsa-stained thin blood smears flow cytometry.
results: good correlation whole-body bioluminescence signal
and parasitaemia measured using giemsa-stained thin blood smears flow
cytometry respectively donor study mice modified thompson test. the
algebraic formulas represent correlations successfully used to
assess plpp donor study mice. addition, new methodology can
pinpoint sick animals 2-8 days would otherwise diagnosed
based behavioural signs malaria disease.
conclusions: new method predicting parasitaemia modified thompson 
test simple, precise, objective, minimizes false positive results can
lead premature removal animals study. furthermore, animal
welfare perspective replace, reduce, refine, new method facilitates
early removal sick animals study soon study objective 
achieved, many cases well clinical signs disease present.
