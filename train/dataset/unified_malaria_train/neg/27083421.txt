with renewed hope malaria elimination, interventions prevent
transmission parasites humans mosquitoes received elevated
attention. transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) targeting sexual stages 
well suited task. here, bioinformatic analysis, selected two 
putative plasmodium berghei ookinete-stage proteins (pbanka_111920, and
pbanka_145770) previously characterized ookinete protein pbanka_135340
(psop7) evaluation transmission-blocking potentials. fragments of
these predicted proteins expressed bacteria purified recombinant
proteins used immunize mice. antisera recombinant proteins 
recognized proteins predicted sizes ookinete lysates localized 
expression surface ookinetes. inclusion antisera vitro
ookinete culture significantly inhibited ookinete formation. mosquitoes fed on
mice immunized recombinant proteins also showed significantly reduced
oocyst densities (60.0-70.7%) modest reductions oocyst prevalence
(10.7-37.4%). data, together conservation genes in
plasmodium, suggest three ookinete proteins could new promising
targets tbvs worth future investigations human malaria
parasites.
