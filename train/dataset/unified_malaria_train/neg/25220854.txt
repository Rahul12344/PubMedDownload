gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (gnih) neuropeptide inhibitor of
gonadotropin secretion, first identified japanese quail
hypothalamus. gnih peptides share c-terminal lpxrfamide (x=l q) motif in
most vertebrates. receptor gnih (gnihr) seven-transmembrane g
protein-coupled receptor 147 (gpr147) inhibits camp production. gpr147 is
also named neuropeptide ff (npff) receptor 1 (npffr1), also binds npff
that c-terminal pqrfamide motif. understand evolutionary history 
the gnih system animal kingdom, searched receptors structurally
similar gnihr genome six mammals (human, mouse, rat, cattle, cat,
and rabbit), five birds (pigeon, chicken, turkey, budgerigar, zebra finch),
one reptile (green anole), one amphibian (western clawed flog), six fishes
(zebrafish, nile tilapia, fugu, coelacanth, spotted gar, lamprey), one
hemichordate (acorn worm), one echinoderm (purple sea urchin), one mollusk
(california sea hare), seven insects (pea aphid, african malaria mosquito, honey 
bee, buff-tailed bumblebee, fruit fly, jewel wasp, red flour beetle), one
cnidarian (hydra), constructed phylogenetic trees neighbor joining (nj)
and maximum likelihood (ml) methods. multiple sequence alignment the
receptors showed highly conserved seven-transmembrane domains well as
disulfide bridge sites first second extracellular loops,
including receptor hydra. nj ml analyses grouped receptors of
vertebrates npffr1 npffr2 (gpr74), receptors insects the
receptor sifamide peptides share c-terminal yrkppfngsifamide motif.
although human, quail zebrafish gnihr (npffr1) structurally similar
to sifamide receptor fruit fly famide peptide (fmrfamide, neuropeptide 
f, short neuropeptide f, drosulfakinin, myosuppressin, sifamide) receptor
families, amino acid sequences peptide coding regions gnih
precursors similar fmrfamide precursor fruit fly the
precursors famide peptide families. chromosome synteny analysis the
precursor genes human, quail zebrafish gnih fruit fly famide peptides 
further identified conserved synteny vertebrate gnih fruit fly fmrfa
precursor genes well famide peptide precursor genes. results
suggest gnih receptor pair sifamide receptor pair may
have diverged co-evolved independently vertebrates insects,
respectively, ancestral famide peptide receptor pair, during
diversification evolution deuterostomian protostomian species.
