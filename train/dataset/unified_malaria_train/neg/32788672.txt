cerebral malaria (cm) deadliest form severe plasmodium infections.
currently, limited understanding mechanisms plasmodium
parasites induce cm. mouse model cm, experimental cm (ecm), induced by
infection rodent parasite, plasmodium berghei anka (pbanka) been
extensively used study pathophysiology cm. recent genomic analyses
revealed coding regions pbanka closely related plasmodium
berghei nk65 (pbnk65), cause ecm, differ 21 single
nucleotide polymorphysims (snps). thus, snp-containing genes might contribute
to pathogenesis ecm. although majority snps located in
genes unknown function, one snp located dna binding site member
of plasmodium apiap2 transcription factor family, recently showed
functions virulence factor alternating host's immune response the
parasite. here, investigated impact snp development ecm.
our results using crispr-cas9 engineered parasites indicate despite its
immune modulatory function, snp neither necessary sufficient induce
ecm thus cannot account parasite strain-specific differences ecm
phenotypes.
