in senegal, antimalarial drugs used treatment prevention malaria are
one main reasons current success controlling malaria. however, 
the successful control malaria highly dependent continued effectiveness 
of drugs may compromised spread drug resistance.
therefore, surveillance drug resistance malaria parasites essential.
the objective pilot study test feasibility routinely
sampled malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) national scale assess the
temporal changes molecular profiles antimalarial drug resistance
markers plasmodium falciparum parasites. overall, 9,549 positive malaria rdts 
were collected 14 health facilities across country. limited random set
of rdts analyzed regarding pfcrt gene polymorphisms codon 72-76. overall,
a high varied prevalence (> 50%) wild-type cvmnk haplotype was
observed including higher cvmnk prevalence northern part (75%) compared 
with southern part country (59%). caution, study provides a
proof concept reuse discarded p. falciparum positive rdts be
applied large-scale surveillance antimalarial drug resistance.
