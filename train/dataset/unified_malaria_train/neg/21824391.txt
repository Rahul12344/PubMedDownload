background: frozen blood clots remaining serum collection often
disregarded source host pathogen dna due troublesome handling and
suboptimal outcome.
methods: high-speed shaking clot samples cell disruptor manufactured 
homogenization tissue faecal specimens evaluated processing frozen
blood clots dna extraction. method compared two commercial clot
protocols based chemical kit centrifugation plastic sieve,
followed dna extraction protocol. blood clots different levels
of parasitaemia (1-1,000 p/μl) prepared parasite cultures assess
sensitivity pcr detection. addition, clots retrieved serum samples
collected within two epidemiological studies kenya (n = 630) processed by
high speed shaking analysed pcr detection malaria parasites the
human α-thalassaemia gene.
results: high speed shaking succeeded fully dispersing clots the
method generated highest dna yield. level pcr detection p.
falciparum parasites human thalassaemia gene samples
optimally collected anticoagulant. commercial clot protocol and
centrifugation sieve failed fully dissolve clots resulted in
lower sensitivity pcr detection.
conclusions: high speed shaking simple efficacious method for
homogenizing frozen blood clots dna purification resulted pcr
templates high quality humans malaria parasites. novel
method enables genetic studies stored blood clots.
