protective vaccination induces self-healing otherwise fatal blood-stage
malaria plasmodium chabaudi female balb/c mice. trace processes
critically involved self-healing, liver, effector blood-stage
malaria, analyzed possible changes transcriptome in
vaccination-protected comparison non-protected mice toward end the
crisis phase. gene expression microarray analyses reveal vaccination does
not affect constitutive expression mrna lincrna. however, malaria induces 
significant (p < 0.01) differences hepatic gene lincrna expression in
vaccination-protected vs. non-vaccinated mice toward end crisis phase. 
vaccination-protected mice, infections induce up-regulations 276 genes 40 
lincrnas down-regulations 200 genes 43 lincrnas, respectively, by
>3-fold compared corresponding constitutive expressions. massive
up-regulations, partly >100-fold, found genes rhd, add2, ank1,
ermap, slc4a, encode proteins erythrocytic surface membranes, as
gata1 gfi1b, encode transcription factors involved erythrocytic
development. also, cldn13 previously predicted expressed erythroblast
surfaces up-regulated >200-fold, though claudins known main
constituents tight junctions acting paracellular barriers between
epithelial cells. genes up-regulated <100- >10-fold, can
be subgrouped genes encoding proteins known involved mitosis, cell
cycle regulation, dna repair. data suggest protective vaccination
enables liver respond p. chabaudi infections accelerated
regeneration extramedullary erythropoiesis crisis, contributes
to survival otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria.
