objective: determine hiv-1 risk groups impact transmitted diversity and
the tempo viral evolution population scale.
methods: investigated set previously described transmission chains
(n = 70) using population genetic approach, tested whether expected
differences proportions multivariant transmissions reflected varying
proportions transmitted diversity men sex men (msm) and
heterosexual (het) subpopulations - largest contributors hiv spread. to
assess evolutionary rate differences among different risk groups, compiled
risk group datasets subtypes a1, b crf01_ae, directly compared the
absolute substitution rate synonymous non-synonymous components.
results: sufficient demographic signal inform transmission model
in bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees using env data compare the
transmission bottleneck size msm het risk groups. found no
indications different proportion transmitted genetic diversity the
population level groups. direct rate comparisons the
risk groups, however, consistently recovered higher evolutionary rate the
male-dominated risk group compared het datasets.
conclusion: find risk group composition affects viral
evolutionary rate therefore potentially also adaptation rate. in
particular, risk group-specific sex ratios, variation within-host
evolutionary rates men women, impose evolutionary rate differences at
the epidemic level, cannot exclude role varying transmission rates.
