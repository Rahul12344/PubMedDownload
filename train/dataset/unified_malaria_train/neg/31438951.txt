background: ability plasmodium falciparum parasites develop resistance 
to widely used anti-malarials threatens malaria control elimination efforts. 
regular drug efficacy monitoring essential ensuring effective treatment
policies. low transmission settings therapeutic efficacy studies are
often feasible, routine surveillance molecular markers associated with
anti-malarial resistance provides alternative early detection of
emerging resistance. longitudinal survey changes prevalence of
selected molecular markers resistance conducted malaria-endemic
regions mpumalanga province, south africa, malaria elimination a
district-level pursued.
methods: molecular analyses determine prevalence alleles associated
with resistance lumefantrine (mdr86n, crt76k mdr1 copy number variation)
and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (dhfr triple, dhps double, sp quintuple) were
conducted 2001 2018, artemisinin resistance markers (kelch13
mutations) assessed 2018.
results: parasite dna successfully amplified 1667/2393 (70%) of
malaria-positive rapid diagnostic tests routinely collected primary health
care facilities. artemisinin resistance-associated kelch13 mutations nor
amplification mdr1 gene copy number associated lumefantrine
resistance observed. however, prevalence mdr86n crt76k
alleles increased markedly study period, isolates collected 
2018 carrying markers. sp quintuple mutation prevalence increased steadily 
from 14% 2001 96% 2018. mixed alleles codons assessed were
rare 2018.
conclusion: kelch13 mutations confirmed suspected associated with
artemisinin resistance identified 2018. although parasites carrying the
mdr86n crt76k alleles associated reduced lumefantrine susceptibility
were strongly selected study period, nearing fixation 2018, the
marker lumefantrine resistance, namely increased mdr1 copy number, not
observed study. increase mdr86n crt76k allele prevalence
together intense regional artemether-lumefantrine drug pressure, raises
concern regarding sustained artemether-lumefantrine efficacy. regular,
rigorous anti-malarial resistance marker surveillance across three south
african malaria-endemic provinces inform case management recommended.
