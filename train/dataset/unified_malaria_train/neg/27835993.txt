background: tick-borne babesia bigemina responsible acute potentially 
lethal hemolytic disease cattle. development genetic manipulation tools
necessary better understanding parasite biology currently limited by
the lack complete parasite genome experimental tools as
transfection. effective promoters, required regulate expression transgenes,
such elongation factor-1 alpha (ef-1α), identified other
apicomplexans babesia bovis plasmodium falciparum.
methods: b. bigemina ef-1a locus defined searching partial genome
library b. bigemina (sanger institute). presence intron 5'
untranslated region determined 5' rapid amplification cdna ends (race) 
analysis. promoter activity determined measurement luciferase
expression several time points electroporation, efficiency of
transfections normalization data determined quantitative pcr by
the percentage parasitized erythrocytes.
results: ef-1α locus contains two identical head head ef-1α genes
separated 1.425 kb intergenic (ig) region. significant sequence divergence
in regions upstream inverted repeats side b. bigemina
ig region suggest independent regulation mechanisms controlling expression of
each two ef-1α genes. plasmid constructs containing 5' 3' halves
of ig regions controlling expression luciferase gene containing 
3' region b. bigemina rap-1a gene, generated testing of
luciferase activity transiently transfected parasites. halves the
ef-1α ig region tested showed ability promote high level production of
luciferase. moreover, b. bigemina ef-1α promoters also active in
transiently transfected b. bovis conversely, b. bovis ef-1α promoter is
active transiently transfected b. bigemina.
conclusions: collectively data demonstrate existence two distinct
promoters homologous heterologous promoter function b. bigemina and
b. bovis described first time babesia species. study 
of significance development interspecies stable transfection systems for
b. bigemina b. bovis.
