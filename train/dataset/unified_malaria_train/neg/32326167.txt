artemisinin-based drugs effective medicine malaria
treatment. date, main method artemisinin production extraction
from wormwood plants artemisia annua l. due limitation source,
considerable efforts directed development methods for
artemisinin production using heterologous expression systems. artemisinin a
sesquiterpene lactone, synthesized cyclization farnesyl
diphosphate involved sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. chrysanthemum
species well a. annua, belong asteraceae family, been
characterized containing highly content sesquiterpenes their
precursors. makes chrysanthemum promising target production of
artemisinin heterologous host plants. chrysanthemum (c. morifolium ramat.) was
transformed agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying binary vectors p1240
and p1250, bearing artemisinin biosynthesis genes coding: amorpha-4,11-diene
synthase, artemisinic aldehyde Î´11(13) reductase, amorpha-4,11-diene
monooxygenase (p1240 targeted mitochondria p1250 targeted to
the cytosol), cytochrome p450 reductase a. annua, well yeast truncated
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme reductase. study obtained 8
kanamycin-resistant lines transformation p1240 2 lines from
p1250. target genes detected 2 1 transgenic lines 2
vectors. transformation frequency target genes 0.33% 0.17%
for p1240 p1250, relative total transformed explant numbers. rt-pcr
analysis revealed transcription transferred genes two lines
obtained transformation p1240 vector, confirming possibility
of transferring genetic modules encoding entire biochemical pathways the
chrysanthemum genome. holds promise development a
chrysanthemum-based expression system produce non-protein substances, 
artemisinin.
