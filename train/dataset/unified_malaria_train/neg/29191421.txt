the p23 proteins small acidic proteins aid functional cycle the
hsp90 molecular chaperone. co-chaperone acts temporarily inhibiting the
atpase activity hsp90 exhibits intrinsic chaperone activity, suggesting
independent roles. search p23 plasmodium falciparum genome led to
the identification two putative proteins showing 13% identity other
and approximately 20% identity human p23. understand presence two
p23 proteins organism, generated recombinant p23 proteins (pfp23a 
pfp23b) investigated structure function. proteins presented
some similarities dissimilarities structural contents showed different
chemical thermal stabilities, pfp23a stable pfp23b,
suggesting proteins may present different functions organism. 
both pfp23 proteins behaved elongated monomers solution capable of
preventing thermal-induced aggregation model client proteins with
different efficiencies. finally, pfp23 proteins inhibited atpase activity
of recombinant p. falciparum hsp90 (pfhsp90). results validate studied 
proteins p23 proteins co-chaperones pfhsp90.
