north-east india, corridor south-east asia, believed play an
important role transmitting drug resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria to
india south asia. north-east india first place india record the
emergence drug resistance chloroquine well as
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine. presently chloroquine resistance widespread all
over north-east india resistance anti-malarials increasing.
in study vivo therapeutic efficacy molecular assays used to
screen spectrum drug resistance chloroquine and
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine circulating p. falciparum strains. total of
220 p. falciparum positives subjects enrolled study therapeutic
assessment chloroquine sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine assessment point 
mutations conferring resistances drugs carried genotyping
the isolates following standard methods. overall clinical failures in
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine chloroquine found 12.6 69.5%
respectively, overall treatment failures recorded 13.7 81.5% in
the two arms. nearly (99.0%) isolates mutant pfcrt genotype (76 t),
while 68% mutant pfmdr-1 genotype (86 y). mutation dhps 437 codon 
most prevalent one dhfr codon 108 showed 100% mutation. total 23
unique haplotypes dhps locus 7 dhfr locus found while
dhps-dhfr combined loci revealed 49 unique haplotypes. prevalence double,
triple quadruple mutations common 1 haplotype found all
five mutated codons (f/agegs/t) dhps locus. detection quadruple mutants (51
i/59 r/108 n/164 l) present study, earlier recorded car nicobar
island, india only, indicates presence high levels resistance to
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine north-east india. associations resistant
haplotypes clinical outcomes emerging resistance in
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine relation efficacy currently used
artemisinin combination therapy discussed.
