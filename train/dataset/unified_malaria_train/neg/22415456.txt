malaria genetic variation extensively characterized, level of
epigenetic plasticity remains largely unexplored. provide comprehensive
characterization transcriptional variation lethal malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, based highly accurate transcriptional
analysis isogenic parasite lines grown homogeneous conditions. this
analysis revealed extensive transcriptional heterogeneity within genetically
homogeneous clonal parasite populations. show clonally variant expression
controlled epigenetic level intrinsic property specific genes and
gene families, majority participate host-parasite interactions.
intrinsic transcriptional variability restricted genes involved in
immune evasion, also affects genes linked lipid metabolism, protein
folding, erythrocyte remodeling, transcriptional regulation, among others,
indicating epigenetic variation results antigenic functional
variation. observed general association heterochromatin marks and
clonally variant expression, extending previous observations specific genes
to essentially variantly expressed gene families. results suggest 
phenotypic variation functionally unrelated p. falciparum gene families is
mediated common mechanism based reversible formation h3k9me3-based
heterochromatin. changing environments, diversity confers fitness a
population. results support idea p. falciparum uses bet-hedging
strategy, alternative directed transcriptional responses, adapt to
common fluctuations environment. consistent idea, found 
transcriptionally different isogenic parasite lines markedly differed their
survival heat-shock mimicking febrile episodes adapted periodic
heat-shock pattern consistent natural selection pre-existing
parasites.
