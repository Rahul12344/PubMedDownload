a source antimicrobial, antioxidant antiplasmodial compounds was
evaluated. cultivable bacterial community studied isolation,
cultivation 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-three bacterial strains were
isolated identified proteobacteria (α γ classes) actinobacteria
phyla. furthermore, three different bacterial morphotypes localized
extracellularly within sponge tissues revealed microscopic
observations. bacterial strains assigned seven different genera, namely
vibrio, photobacterium, shewanella, pseudomonas, ruegeria, pseudovibrio and
citricoccus. strains affiliated genus differentiated
according genetic dissimilarities using random amplified polymorphic dna
(rapd) analyses. eleven bacterial strains selected evaluation their
bioactivities. three isolates pseudovibrio p1ma4, vibrio p1manal1 citricoccus
p1s7 revealed antimicrobial activity; citricoccus p1s7 vibrio p1manal1
isolates also exhibited antiplasmodial activity, two vibrio isolates p1ma8 
and p1ma5 displayed antioxidant activity. data confirmed importance
