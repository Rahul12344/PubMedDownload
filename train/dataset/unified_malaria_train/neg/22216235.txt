research biology malaria parasites greatly benefited the
application reverse genetic technologies, particular analysis
of gene deletion mutants studies transgenic parasites express
heterologous mutated proteins. however, transfection plasmodium limited 
by paucity drug-selectable markers hampers subsequent genetic
modification mutant. report development novel 'gene
insertion/marker out' (gimo) method two rodent malaria parasites, uses 
negative selection rapidly generate transgenic mutants ready subsequent
modifications. created reference mother lines p. berghei anka
and p. yoelii 17xnl serve recipient parasites gimo-transfection.
compared existing protocols gimo-transfection greatly simplifies speeds up
the generation mutants expressing heterologous proteins, free of
drug-resistance genes, requires far fewer laboratory animals. addition 
demonstrate gimo-transfection also simple fast method genetic
complementation mutants gene deletion mutation. implementation
of gimo-transfection procedures greatly enhance plasmodium reverse-genetic
research.
