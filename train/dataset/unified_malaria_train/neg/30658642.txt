background: prior project, handful online visualizations
existed exploring published literature molecular markers of
antimalarial drug resistance, none specifically markers associated
with plasmodium falciparum resistance partner drugs artemisinin-based
combination therapy (act). molecular information collected studies with
different designs, using variety molecular methodologies data analysis
strategies, making difficult compare across studies. purpose this
project develop free online tool, visualizes widely published 
data molecular markers antimalarial drug resistance, starting two 
genes pfcrt pfmdr-1, associated resistance three common
partner drugs; amodiaquine, lumefantrine mefloquine.
methods: literature review conducted, standardized method used to
extract data publications, critical decisions visualization were
made. global geospatial database developed specific pfmdr1 pfcrt
single nucleotide polymorphisms pfmdr1 copy number variation. informatics 
framework developed allowed flexibility development tool 
time efficient adaptation different source data.
results: database discussed paper pfmdr1 pfcrt marker
prevalence information, 579 geographic sites 76 different countries,
including results 86,000 samples 456 articles published january
2001-may 2017. act partner drugs molecular surveyor launched the
worldwide antimalarial resistance network (wwarn) march 2015 has
attracted 3000 unique visitors since then. presented demonstration
of surveyor database explored monitor local, temporal changes
in prevalence molecular markers. publications may 2017 were
included, however online act partner drug molecular surveyor continuously 
updated new data relevant markers.
conclusions: wwarn act partner drugs molecular surveyor summarizes data on
resistance markers pfmdr1 pfcrt genes. database fully
accessible, providing users rich resource explore analyze, thus
utilize centralized, standardized database different purposes. this
open-source software framework adapted data, demonstrated by
the subsequent launch artemisinin molecular surveyor vivax
surveyor.
