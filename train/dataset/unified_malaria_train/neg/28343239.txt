killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kirs) modulate disease progression 
pathogens including hiv, malaria, hepatitis c. cynomolgus rhesus macaques
are widely used nonhuman primate models study human pathogens, so,
considerable effort put characterizing kir genetics. however,
previous studies relied cdna cloning sanger sequencing lack 
throughput current sequencing platforms. study, present high
throughput, full-length allele discovery method utilizing pacific biosciences
circular consensus sequencing (ccs). also describe new approach macaque
exome sequencing (mes) development rhexome1.0, adapted target
capture reagent includes macaque-specific capture probe sets. using
sequence reads generated whole genome sequencing (wgs) mes inform
primer design, able increase sensitivity kir allele discovery. 
we demonstrate increased sensitivity defining nine novel alleles within a
cohort mauritian cynomolgus macaques (mcm), geographically isolated
population restricted kir genetics thought completely
characterized. finally, describe approach genotyping kirs directly 
sequence reads generated using wgs/mes reads. findings presented expand 
our understanding kir genetics mcm associating new genes eight 
kir haplotypes demonstrating existence least one kir3ds gene
associated every haplotype.
