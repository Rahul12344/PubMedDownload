the circumsporozoite protein (csp) thrombospondin-related adhesion protein
(trap) major targets pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine development.
however, csp-based vaccine rts,s provides marginal protection,
highlighting need innovative vaccine design development. we
design characterize expression folding p. berghei (pb) p.
falciparum (pf) trap-csp fusion proteins, evaluate immunogenicity and
sterilizing immunity mice. trap n-terminal domains fused csp
c-terminal Î±tsr domain without csp repeat region, expressed in
mammalian cells, evaluated without n-glycan shaving. pb pf
fusions expressed substantially better trap csp components 
alone; furthermore, fusions csp component could purified to
homogeneity well folded monomeric. yields trap csp
fragments insufficient, immunized balb/c mice pb trap-csp fusions in
addavax adjuvant tested effects absence presence csp repeats
and absence presence high mannose n-glycans total antibody titer and
protection infection mosquito bite 2.5 months 6 months the
last immunization. fusions containing repeats completely protective
against challenge re-challenge, lacking repeats were
significantly less effective. results correlated higher total antibody
titers repeats present. results show trap-csp fusions increase
protein antigen production, potential yield effective vaccines, and
also guide design effective proteins encoded nucleic acid-based
and virally vectored vaccines.
