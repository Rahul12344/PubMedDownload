a reduction global burden malaria past two decades has
encouraged efforts regional malaria elimination. despite need target
all plasmodium species, current focus mainly directed towards plasmodium
falciparum, lesser extent p. vivax. substantial lack data 
on global local transmission patterns neglected malaria parasites
p. malariae p. ovale spp. used species-specific real-time pcr assay
targeting plasmodium 18s rrna gene evaluate temporal trends the
prevalence human malaria parasites 22-year period rural
village tanzania.we tested 2897 blood samples collected five
cross-sectional surveys conducted 1994 2016. infections p.
falciparum, p. malariae, p. ovale spp. detected throughout study
period, p. vivax detected. 1994 2010, found more
than 90% reduction odds infection detected species. odds
of p. falciparum infection reduced 2016, odds p.
malariae p. ovale spp. infection increased 2- 6-fold, respectively,
compared 2010. 2016, non-falciparum species occurred often as
mono-infections. results demonstrate persistent transmission p. ovale 
spp., lesser extent p. malariae despite continued decline p.
falciparum transmission. illustrates transmission patterns the
non-falciparum species necessarily follow p. falciparum,
stressing need attention towards non-falciparum malaria africa.
malaria elimination require better understanding epidemiology p.
malariae p. ovale spp. improved tools monitoring transmission 
all plasmodium species, particular focus towards identifying asymptomatic 
carriers infection designing appropriate interventions enhance malaria 
control.
