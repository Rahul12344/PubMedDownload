hypothetical proteins comprise roughly half predicted gene complement of
toxoplasma gondii plasmodium falciparum represent largest class of
uniquely functioning proteins parasites. following idea that
functional relationships informed timing gene expression, we
devised strategy identify core set apicomplexan cell division cycling
genes important roles parasite division, includes many
uncharacterized proteins. assembled expanded list orthologs t. 
gondii p. falciparum genome sequences (2781 putative orthologs), compared
their mrna profiles synchronous replication, sorted resulting set 
of dual cell cycle regulated orthologs (744 total) protein pairs conserved
across many eukaryotic families versus unique apicomplexa. the
analysis identified 100 ortholog gene pairs unknown function t.
gondii p. falciparum displayed co-conserved mrna abundance, dynamics 
cyclical expression similar peak timing spanned complete division
cycle parasite. unknown cyclical mrnas encoded diverse set of
proteins wide range mass showed remarkable conservation the
internal organization ordered versus disordered structural domains. a
representative sample cyclical unknown genes (16 total) epitope tagged 
t. gondii tachyzoites yielding discovery new protein constituents the
parasite inner membrane complex, key mitotic structures invasion organelles. 
these results demonstrate utility using gene expression timing dynamic
profile identify proteins unique roles apicomplexa biology.
