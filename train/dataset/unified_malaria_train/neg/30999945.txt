background: plasmodium vivax contains approximately 5400 coding genes, 
40% code hypothetical proteins functionally
characterized. previous preliminary screening using pooled serum samples,
numerous hypothetical proteins selected among highly
transcribed schizont-stage parasites, highly antigenic p. vivax
candidates including hypothetical proteins identified. however, their
immunological functional activities p. vivax remain unclear. these
candidates, investigated p. vivax 50-kda protein (pv50, pvx_087140)
containing highly conserved signal peptide shows high transcription levels
in blood-stage parasites.
results: recombinant pv50 expressed cell-free expression system used
for igg prevalence analysis patients vivax malaria healthy
individuals. immune responses analyzed immunized mice mouse
antibodies used detect subcellular localization protein in
blood-stage parasites immunofluorescence assay. protein array method was
used evaluate protein-protein interactions predict protein functional
activities invasion parasites erythrocytes. recombinant pv50
showed igg prevalence patient samples sensitivity 42.9% and
specificity 93.8% compared healthy individuals. non-cytophilic 
antibodies igg1 igg3 major components involved antibody
response pv50-immunized mice. pv50 localized surface merozoites 
a specific interaction pv50 pvmsp1 detected, suggesting that
pv50-pvmsp1 forms heterodimeric complex p. vivax.
conclusions: increased immune responses caused native p. vivax parasites 
detected, confirming immunogenic effects. study provides method for
detecting new malaria antigens, pv50 may vivax malaria vaccine candidate
with pvmsp1.
