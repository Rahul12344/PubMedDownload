background: purpose studying functional human dendritic cells (dcs) in
a humanized mouse model mimics human immune system (his), model
referred mice established.
methods: human immune system mice made engrafting nod/scid/il2rgammanull 
(nsg) mice human hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) following transduction 
of genes encoding human cytokines human leukocyte antigen (hla)-a2.1 by
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (aav9) vectors.
results: results indicate human dc subsets, cd141+cd11c+ and
cd1c+cd11c+ myeloid dcs, distribute throughout several organs mice
including blood, bone marrow, spleen, draining lymph nodes. cd141+cd11c+ 
and cd1c+cd11c+ human dcs isolated mice immunized adenoviruses
expressing malaria/human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) epitopes able to
induce proliferation malaria/hiv epitopes-specific human cd8+ cells in
vitro. upregulation cd1c also observed human cd141+ dcs 1 day after
immunization adenovirus-based vaccines.
conclusions: establishment humanized mouse model mounts functional
human dcs enables preclinical assessment immunogenicity human vaccines 
in vivo.
