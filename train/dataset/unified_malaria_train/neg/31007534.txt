background: several studies reported strong resistance anopheles
gambiae s.l. complex species pyrethroids. voltage-dependent sodium channel
(vgsc) gene main target pyrethroids ddt. benin, frequency of
the resistant allele (l1014f) gene varies along north-south transect.
monitoring evolution resistance necessary better appreciate the
genetic structure vector populations localities subject intensive
use chemicals associated control initiatives. purpose this
study map distribution pyrethroid insecticide resistance alleles of
the kdr gene malaria vectors different regions ecological facies in
order identify evolutionary forces might basis anopheline
population dynamics.
methods: characterization anopheles gambiae s.l. populations and
resistance mechanisms performed using adult mosquitoes obtained larvae 
collected four agroecological zones southern benin. genomic dna
extraction performed whole mosquitoes.the extracted genomic dna 
were used molecular identification species anopheles gambiae s.l.
complex identification genotypes related pyrethroid resistance as
the kdr gene amino acid position 1014 sodium channel. molecular speciation and
genotyping kdr resistant alleles (1014) done using pcr.genepop software
version 4.2 used calculate allelic genotypic frequencies each
agroecological zone. p value allelic frequency determined using
the binomial test function r version 3.3.3. hardy-weinberg equilibrium was
checked population genetics software version 1.3.8.1. observed 
heterozygosity expected heterozygosity well fixation index 
genetic differentiation index within populations calculated
using genepop software version 4.2.
results: study period, anopheles coluzzii major species all
agroecological zones anopheles gambiae scarcely represented. regardless
of species, resistant homozygote individuals (l1014f/l1014f) dominant in
all agroecological zones, showing strong selection resistant allele
(l1014f). populations showed deficit heterozygosity. genetic
differentiation observed different populations two
species. anopheles coluzzii, small differentiation among the
populations central cotton bar-lands zones. genetic
differentiation modest among population fisheries zone
(fst = 0.1295). genetic differentiation high population of
anopheles gambiae bar-lands zone (fst = 0.2408).
conclusion: study revealed use insecticides benin years
has altered genetic structure anopheles gambiae s.s. populations all
agroecological zones southern benin. would desirable orientate vector
control efforts towards use insecticides pyrethroids ddt or
combinations insecticides different modes action.
