male female gametocytes infectious forms critical malaria
transmission targets intervention. gametocytes generally produced in
relatively small numbers, difficult obtain pure male and
female gametocytes various studies. male female gametocytes expressing
unique fluorescence reporters generated plasmodium falciparum 
and plasmodium berghei parasites, allows isolation large numbers pure
male female gametocytes greatly contributed understanding of
gametocyte biology. establish plasmodium yoelii another model studying 
gametocytogenesis, generate parasite line male female
gametocytes expressing gfp mcherry reporter, respectively, using
crispr/cas9-mediated gene editing method. first inserted genes encoding intact
fluorescence proteins downstream parasite coding region ccp2 dhc1
genes, respectively, generating knockin parasites producing ccp2::mcherry
(female) dhc1::gfp (male) gametocytes. next obtained parasite clone
carrying double-fluorescent reporters genetically crossing ccp2::mcherry
and dhc1::gfp lines. resulting double-labeled dfsc7 parasite displays normal 
development whole life cycle expresses fluorescence proteins
in male female gametocyte separately. parasite strain provides new
platform facilitating studies gametocyte biology malaria transmission.
