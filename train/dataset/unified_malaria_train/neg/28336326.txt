the development spread multidrug-resistant strains malarial parasites
have led overwhelming increase resistance current antimalarial
drugs. urgent need alternative antimalarial drugs directed of
the current studies toward folkloric medicine approaches. interestingly, the
zizyphus spina cristi leaf extract (zle) found exhibit antiplasmodial
activity. study evaluated protective effect zle plasmodium
berghei-induced cerebral tissue injuries mice. male c57bl/6 mice received an
injection p. berghei-infected red blood cells. mice divided three
groups (control, infected, zle-treated), subjected histological, 
biochemical, molecular analyses. murine malaria infections induced
significant weight loss; however, upon zle treatment, weight mice was
markedly restored. additionally, infected mice showed brain histopathological
changes induction oxidative damage. significantly, zle treatment restored 
the levels oxidative markers antioxidant enzyme normal ranges. 
mrna expression several genes brain mice including cacnb4, adam23,
glrb, vdac3, cabp1 significantly upregulated p. berghei infection.
in contrast, zle markedly reduced mrna expression genes. to
conclude, results indicate zle could play important role reducing 
the destructive effect p. berghei-induced cerebral malaria owing its
antiplasmodial antioxidant activities.
