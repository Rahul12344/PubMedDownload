k+ channels integral membrane proteins, contribute maintain vital
parameters cellular membrane potential cell volume. malaria
parasites encode two k+ channel homologues, kch1 kch2, are
well-conserved among members plasmodium genus. rodent malaria
parasite p. berghei, functional significance k+ channel homologue pbkch2
was studied using targeted gene knock-out. knockout parasites were
characterized mouse model terms growth-kinetics infectivity the
mosquito vector. furthermore, using tracer-uptake technique 86rb+ k+ 
congener, k+ transporting properties knockout parasites were
assessed.results: genetic disruption kch2 grossly affect phenotype
in terms asexual replication pathogenicity mouse model. contrast
to kch1-null parasites, kch2-null parasites fully capable forming oocysts
in female anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. 86rb+ uptake kch2-deficient
blood-stage p. berghei parasites (kch2-null) differ of
wild-type (wt) parasites. two-thirds 86rb+ uptake wt in
kch2-null parasites could inhibited k+ channel blockers could be
inferred presence functional kch1 kch2 knockout parasites. kch2 is
therefore required transport k+ p. berghei essential 
mosquito-stage sporogonic development parasite.
