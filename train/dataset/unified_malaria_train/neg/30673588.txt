prevalence responses anthropic factors differ across hosts parasite
species. analyzed spatiotemporal variation avian haemosporidian
prevalence bird assemblages mooswald forest (i.e., urban greenspace;
freiburg, germany), response local environmental features (e.g., water
sources, human presence (visited)/absence (unvisited)) bird-level traits
(e.g., body condition, age, sex) 2 years. used nested pcr protocol
(mitochondrial (mt)dna cytochrome b (cyt b) gene) microscopy determine
haemosporidian infections. prevalence analyzed using general linear
multi-model (glmulti) approach akaike information criterion corrected for
small samples (aicc), subsequent model inferences using glmm best
selected model, considering bird species random factor. analyses were
conducted main understory bird species (blackcap - sylvia atricapilla,
chaffinch - coereba flaveola, great tit - parus major, blue tit - cyanistes
caeruleus, european robin - erithacus rubecula, blackbird - turdus merula, song
thrush - turdus philomelos). conducted spatial autocorrelation
analyses haemosporidian infections, classification regression
trees (carts) focal species. analyzed total 544 samples seven bird
species. 2011 prevalence haemoproteus/plasmodium 25.8% 11.7% for
leucocytozoon. 2013 prevalence haemoproteus/plasmodium 26.5% 35.5%
for leucocytozoon. haemosporidian prevalence significantly different 
some focal species. negative association distance the
nearest water source prevalence year 2011, opposite pattern
for year 2013. however, analyzed six focal species separately,
such relationship could change negative positive one, there
could relationship all. leucocytozoon higher prevalence in
the section forest visited humans. find spatial
autocorrelation prevalence across study site, were
statistically significant local spatial clusters visited section. although
there similar responses prevalence factors, infection patterns
were generally bird species-specific. thus, prevalence labile
epidemiological parameter, varying spatiotemporally idiosyncratic way.
