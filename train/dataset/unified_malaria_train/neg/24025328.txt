gene regulation apicomplexan parasites, phylum containing important
protozoan parasites plasmodium toxoplasma, poorly understood. 
life cycle toxoplasma gondii complex, multiple proliferation and
differentiation steps, tachyzoite proliferation relevant 
pathogenesis humans animals. tachyzoites express invasion virulence
factors crucial survival manipulation host cell
functions. expression factors tightly controlled the
tachyzoite cell cycle permit correct packaging newly formed apical
secretory organelles named micronemes rhoptries daughter cells.
however, little known factors control expression genes
encoding virulence factors present parasite-specific secretory
organelles. report plant-like nuclear factor tgap2xi-5 targets more
than 300 gene promoters actively controls transcription genes.
most target genes, including essential parasite
virulence, showed peak expression phases cell cycle.
furthermore, identified cis-regulatory element recognized tgap2xi-5 and
demonstrated ability actively drive gene transcription. results
demonstrated tgap2xi-5 novel dna sequence-specific transcription factor
associated promoter activation. tgap2xi-5 may regulate gene transcription of
crucial virulence factors t. gondii.
