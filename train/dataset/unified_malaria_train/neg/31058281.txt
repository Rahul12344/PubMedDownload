malaria parasites face dynamically changing environments strong selective
constraints within human mosquito hosts. survive hostile shifting
conditions, plasmodium switches transcriptional programs development and
has evolved mechanisms adjust phenotype heterogeneous patterns 
gene expression. vitro studies culture-adapted isolates served set 
the link chromatin structure functional gene expression. yet,
experimental evidence limited certain stages parasite the
vertebrate, i.e. blood, precise mechanisms underlying dynamic
regulatory landscapes development adaptation within-host
conditions remain poorly understood. review, discuss available data on
transcriptional epigenetic regulation plasmodium mosquito stages the
context sporogonic development phenotypic variation, including both
bet-hedging environmentally triggered direct transcriptional responses. 
this, advocate mosquito offers vivo biological model investigate 
the regulatory networks, transcription factors chromatin-modifying enzymes
and modes interaction regulatory sequences, might be
responsible plasticity plasmodium genome dictates stage- 
cell type-specific blueprints gene expression.
