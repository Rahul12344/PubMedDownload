objective: interleukin-4 (il-4) strong chondroprotective cytokine and
polymorphisms within gene may risk factor osteoarthritis (oa). we
aimed investigate genotype allele frequencies il-4 gene intron 3
variable number tandem repeats (vntr) polymorphism patients knee oa in
a turkish population.
methods: study included 202 patients knee oa 180 healthy controls.
genomic dna isolated il-4 gene 70 bp vntr polymorphism determined by
using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) specific primers followed by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis.
results: result show statistically significant difference
between knee oa patients control group respect il-4 genotype
distribution allele frequencies (p=0.000, or: 0.20, 95% ci: 0.10-0.41, or:
0.22, 95% ci: 0.12-0.42, respectively).
conclusions: findings suggest association il-4 gene
intron 3 vntr polymorphism susceptibility person development of
knee oa. result, il-4 gene intron 3 vntr polymorphism could genetic
marker oa turkish study population. first association study
that evaluates associations il-4 gene vntr polymorphism knee oa.
