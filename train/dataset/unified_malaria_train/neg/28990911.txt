contributions species plasmodium falciparum human malaria in
sub-saharan africa uncertain. collected blood children aged 6 months 
to 10 years diagnosed malaria giemsa-stained blood smears (176 subjects) 
or histidine rich protein-2-based rapid diagnostic tests (323 subjects) 2016; 
50 samples 10 sites across uganda studied identify infecting
species. 499 available samples, 474 demonstrated plasmodial infection by
polymerase chain reaction amplification 18s ribosomal rna genes, including p. 
falciparum 472, plasmodium malariae 22, plasmodium ovale 15, and
plasmodium vivax four; 435 pure p. falciparum, two contain p.
falciparum, remainder mixed infections including p. falciparum. 
prevalence nonfalciparum species varied geographically. stratifying based on
recent history indoor residual spraying (irs) insecticides, nonfalciparum
infections seen 27/189 (14.8%) samples sites received and
13/285 (4.6%) samples sites receive irs since 2010 (p =
0.0013). overall, 39/474 (8.2%) samples individuals diagnosed malaria
included nonfalciparum infections. thus, substantial proportion episodes 
malaria uganda include infections plasmodial species p.
falciparum.
