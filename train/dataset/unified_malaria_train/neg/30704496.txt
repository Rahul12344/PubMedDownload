background: malaria important disease many tropical countries. rapid
diagnostic tests (rdts) valuable tools diagnosing malaria remote
areas. majority rdts used diagnosis plasmodium falciparum are
based detection specific histidine-rich proteins (pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3). last decade, threat posed lack expression of
these antigens variability proteins diagnosis malaria
has widely discussed. aim study evaluate genetic
diversity pfhrp2 pfhrp3 p. falciparum isolates collected three
central american countries.
methods: dna samples amplified sequenced assess diversity of
nucleotides amino acids. search known epitopes within amino acid
sequence carried out, sensitivity sequences evaluated
according predictive model. phylogenetic analysis carried out
including homologous sequences different regions world. protein
structures predicted silico.
results: five different patterns pfhrp2 one pattern pfhrp3 were
identified. isolates central america show high level genetic diversity 
in pfhrp2; however, amino acid sequences seem contain enough motifs 
detected rdts currently available.
conclusion: unlikely variability pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes
has significant impact ability rdts detect pfhrp antigens 
in central america.
