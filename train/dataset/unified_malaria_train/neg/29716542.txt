background: plasmodium falciparum virulent malaria parasite capable
of parasitizing human erythrocytes. identification genes related this
capability enhance understanding molecular mechanisms underlying
human malaria lead development new therapeutic strategies for
malaria control. availability several malaria parasite genome
sequences, performing computational analysis practical strategy to
identify genes contributing disease.
results: here, developed used virtual genome method assign 33,314
genes three human malaria parasites, namely, p. falciparum, p. knowlesi 
p. vivax, three rodent malaria parasites, namely, p. berghei, p. chabaudi and
p. yoelii, 4605 clusters. cluster consisted genes whose protein
sequences significantly similar considered virtual gene.
comparing enriched values clusters human malaria parasites with
those rodent malaria parasites revealed 115 p. falciparum genes putatively
responsible parasitizing human erythrocytes. genes mainly located
in chromosome internal regions participate many biological processes, 
including membrane protein trafficking thiamine biosynthesis. meanwhile, 289 
p. berghei genes included rodent parasite-enriched clusters. are
located subtelomeric regions encode erythrocyte surface proteins.
comparing cluster values p. falciparum p. vivax p. knowlesi 
revealed 493 candidate genes linked virulence. encode proteins
present erythrocyte surface participate cytoadhesion, virulence
factor trafficking, erythrocyte invasion, many genes unknown function
were also identified. cerebral malaria characterized accumulation of
infected erythrocytes trophozoite stage brain microvascular. discover
cerebral malaria-related genes, fast fourier transformation (fft) introduced 
to extract genes highly transcribed trophozoite stage. finally, 55
candidate genes identified. considering parasite-infected erythrocyte
surface protein 2 (piesp2) contains gap-junction-related neuromodulin_n domain
and anti-piesp2 might provide protection malaria, chose piesp2
for experimental study.
conclusions: analysis revealed limited number genes linked human
disease p. falciparum genome. genes could interesting targets for
further functional characterization.
