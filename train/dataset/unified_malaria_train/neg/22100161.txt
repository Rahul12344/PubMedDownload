many microbial pathogens, including malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum,
vary surface protein expression evade host immune responses. p. falciparium
antigenic variation linked var gene family-encoded clonally variant surface
protein expression. mututally exclusive var gene expression partially
controlled spatial positioning; silent genes retained distinct
perinuclear sites relocated transcriptionally active locations for
monoallelic expression. show var introns control process and
that var intron addition relocalizes episomes random perinuclear
position. var intron-regulated nuclear tethering repositioning linked
to 18 bp nuclear protein-binding element recruits actin protein
complex. pharmacologically induced f-actin formation, restricted 
nuclear periphery, repositions intron-carrying episomes var genes and
disrupts mutually exclusive var gene expression. thus, actin polymerization
relocates var genes repressive active perinuclear compartment, which
is crucial p. falciparium phenotypic variation pathogenesis.
