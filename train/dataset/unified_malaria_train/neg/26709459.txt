the genetic variation responsible sickle cell allele (hbs) enables
erythrocytes resist infection malaria parasite, p. falciparum. the
molecular basis resistance, known multifactorial, remains 
incompletely understood. recent studies found differential expression of
erythrocyte micrornas, translocated malaria parasites, affect gene
regulation parasite growth. mirnas later shown inhibit mrna
translation forming chimeric rna transcript via 5' rna fusion discreet 
subsets parasite mrnas. here, techniques used study the
functional role putative mechanism underlying erythrocyte micrornas the
gene regulation translational potential p. falciparum, including the
transfection modified synthetic micrornas host erythrocytes, be
detailed.Â  finally, polysome gradient method used determine extent of
translation transcripts. together, techniques allowed us to
demonstrate dysregulated levels erythrocyte micrornas contribute to
cell-intrinsic malaria resistance sickle erythrocytes.
