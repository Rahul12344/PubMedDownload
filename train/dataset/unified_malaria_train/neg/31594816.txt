understanding mechanisms behind host cell invasion plasmodium falciparum
remains major hurdle developing antimalarial therapeutics target the
asexual cycle symptomatic stage malaria. host cell entry enabled by
a multitude precisely timed tightly regulated receptor-ligand
interactions. cyclic nucleotide signaling implicated regulating
parasite invasion, important downstream effector camp-signaling
pathway protein kinase (pka), camp-dependent protein kinase. is
increasing evidence p. falciparum pka (pfpka) responsible for
phosphorylation cytoplasmic domain p. falciparum apical membrane
antigen 1 (pfama1) ser610, camp-dependent event crucial for
successful parasite invasion. present study, crispr-cas9 conditional
gene deletion (dimerizable cre) technologies implemented generate p.
falciparum parasite line expression catalytic subunit pfpka
(pfpkac) conditional control, demonstrating highly efficient dimerizable
cre recombinase (dicre)-mediated gene excision complete knockdown protein 
expression. parasites lacking pfpkac show severely reduced growth one
intraerythrocytic growth cycle deficient host cell invasion, as
highlighted live-imaging experiments. furthermore, pfpkac-deficient parasites 
are unable phosphorylate pfama1 ser610. work identifies an
essential role pfpkac p. falciparum asexual life cycle also
confirms pfpkac kinase responsible phosphorylating pfama1
ser610.importance malaria continues present major global health burden,
particularly low-resource countries. plasmodium falciparum, parasite
responsible severe form malaria, causes disease rapid and
repeated rounds invasion replication within red blood cells. invasion into
red blood cells essential p. falciparum survival, molecular events
mediating process gained much attention potential therapeutic
targets. effective vaccine available, emergence of
resistance antimalarials, urgent need development new
therapeutics. research used genetic techniques provide evidence 
essential protein kinase involved p. falciparum invasion. work adds the
current understanding parasite signaling processes required invasion,
highlighting pka potential drug target inhibit invasion treatment
of malaria.
