the spread anti-malarial drug resistance challenge malaria control
and elimination strategies, routine monitoring resistance-associated
molecular markers commonly used anti-malarial drugs important.
therefore, present investigation, extent mutations/haplotypes in
dhfr dhps genes plasmodium falciparum isolates (n=72) analyzed seven
years introduction sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) plus artesunate
(as) first-line anti-malarial treatment iran using pcr-rflp methods. the
results showed majority patients (97.2%) carried 59r and
108n mutations pure form wild-type genotype positions n51 i164.
additionally, significant increase (p<0.05) observed frequency of
r59n108/g437 haplotype (79.2%) 2012-2014. raise the
significant increase (p<0.05) frequency 437g mutation (81.9%), which
more likely due availability sp anti-malarial drug for
treatment falciparum patients malaria-endemic areas iran. however,
no quintuple mutations associated treatment failure detected. in
conclusion, present results along vivo assays suggest seven
years adoption sp-as first-line treatment iran, drug 
remains efficacious treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria, a
partner drug malaria-endemic areas.
