background: complete malaria eradication optimal use transmission-reducing
interventions require knowledge submicroscopic infectious reservoirs among
asymptomatic individuals. even submicroscopic levels plasmodium falciparum
gametocytes infect mosquitoes promote onward transmission. efforts
to identify gametocyte carriers use polymerase chain reaction amplification of
the gametocyte-specific transcript pfs25.
methods: expand repertoire biomarkers available superior gametocyte
detection, compared gene expression profiles gametocytes and
asynchronous blood-stage p. falciparum parasites microarray technology. this
allowed identification 56 molecules abundantly expressed gametocyte
stage parasite. analytical sensitivity gametocyte detection was
evaluated 25 genes highest expression levels.
results: one candidate, pfg17, exhibited superior analytical sensitivity 
a panel gametocyte-spiked whole blood, detecting 10 gametocytes/ml; in
comparison, pfs25 detected 25.3 gametocytes/ml. pfg17 also exhibited
superior clinical sensitivity, identifying 19.1% samples blood-film
microscopy-negative ghanaian children 40% samples asymptomatic
adults gametocyte positive.
conclusions: cumulatively, results suggest pfg17 excellent biomarker
for detecting asymptomatic infectious reservoirs otherwise missed most
sensitive molecular method available. study also improved repertoire 
of transmission-stage antigens available evaluation candidate vaccines.
