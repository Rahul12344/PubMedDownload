in low-endemic areas malaria transmission, asymptomatic individuals play an
important role reservoirs malarial infection. understanding dynamics
of asymptomatic malaria crucial efficient control regions.
genetic host factors toll-like receptor (tlr) polymorphisms may play a
role maintenance elimination infection. study, effect of
tlr polymorphisms susceptibility malaria investigated among
individuals living atlantic forest são paulo, southern brazil. a
hundred ninety-five brazilian individuals enrolled actively followed
up malaria three years. twenty-four polymorphisms five toll-like
receptor (tlr) genes genotyped rflp, direct sequencing fragment
analysis. genotypes analyzed risk malaria. ongoing plasmodium
vivax p. malariae infection, identified positive results pcr
tests previous p. vivax malaria, assumed antiplasmodial antibodies
against pvmsp119 detected elisa. evaluation genomic ancestry was
conducted using biallelic ancestry informative markers results used 
as correction statistical analysis. nine snps one microsatellite 
found polymorphic three variant alleles tlr genes associated to
malaria susceptibility. regression coefficient estimated snp
tlr9.-1237.t/c indicated presence least one allele c increased, on
average, 2.3 times malaria odds, compared individuals allele c 
this snp. however, individuals sex, age household, the
presence least one allele c snp tlr9.-1486.t/c reduced, average, 1.9 
times malaria odds, compared individuals allele c. moreover, 
allele c plus allele tlr6.p249s individuals sex, age and
ancestry, reduced, average, 4.4 times malaria odds. findings indicate 
a significant association tlr9.-1237.t/c gene polymorphism malarial
infection contribute better knowledge role tlrs malaria
susceptibility epidemiological setting different settings.
