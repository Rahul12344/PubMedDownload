fusidic acid known antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial activities.
fusidic acid blocks translation elongation factor g gene plasmodium
falciparum. present study, inhibitory effects fusidic acid the
in vitro growth bovine equine babesia parasites evaluated. the
inhibitory effect fusidic acid vivo growth babesia microti was
also assessed. vitro growth four babesia species tested was
significantly inhibited (p<0.05) micromolar concentrations fusidic acid
(ic(50) values=144.8, 17.3, 33.3, 56.25 μm babesia bovis, babesia
bigemina, babesia caballi, theileria equi, respectively). combinations of
fusidic acid diminazene aceturate synergistically potentiated inhibitory
effects vitro b. bovis b. caballi. b. microti-infected mice, fusidic
acid caused significant (p<0.05) inhibition growth b. microti the
dose 500 mg/kg bw relative control group. results indicate that
fusidic acid might incorporated treatment babesiosis.
