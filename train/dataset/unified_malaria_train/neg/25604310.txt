background: recent studies demonstrated deletion histidine-rich
protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene (pfhrp2) field isolates plasmodium falciparum,
which could result false negative test results pfhrp2-based rapid
diagnostic tests (rdts) used malaria diagnosis. although primary
diagnosis malaria honduras determined based microscopy, rdts may be
useful remote areas. study, investigated whether are
deletions pfhrp2, pfhrp3 respective flanking genes 68 p.
falciparum parasite isolates collected city puerto lempira, honduras.
in addition, investigation considered possible correlation between
parasite population structure distribution gene deletions by
genotyping seven neutral microsatellites.
methods: sixty-eight samples used study, obtained a
previous chloroquine efficacy study, utilized analysis. samples
were genotyped pfhrp2, pfhrp3 flanking genes pcr. samples were
then genotyped seven neutral microsatellites order determine the
parasite population structure puerto lempira time sample collection.
results: found samples positive pfhrp2 flanking 
genes chromosome 8. however, 50% samples positive pfhrp3 
and neighboring genes rest either pfhrp3-negative 
deleted combination pfhrp3 neighbouring genes chromosome 13.
population structure analysis predicted least two distinct
parasite population clusters sample population. also determined
that greater proportion parasites pfhrp3-(and flanking gene) deletions 
belonged one cluster compared other.
conclusion: findings indicate p. falciparum parasite population in
the municipality puerto lempira maintains pfhrp2 gene that
pfhrp2-based rdts could considered use region; however continued
monitoring parasite population useful detect parasites with
deletions pfhrp2.
