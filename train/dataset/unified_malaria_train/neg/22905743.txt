background: incidence malaria sri lanka significantly declined in
recent years. similar trends seen kataragama, known malaria endemic
location within southern province country, past five years.
this descriptive study anti-malarial antibody levels selected host
genetic mutations residents kataragama, low malaria transmission
conditions.
methods: sera collected 1,011 individuals residing kataragama and
anti-malarial antibodies total ige levels measured standardized
elisa technique. host dna extracted used genotyping selected snps 
in known genes associated malaria. antibody levels analysed in
relation past history malaria (during past 10 years), age, sex, the
location residence within kataragama selected host genetic markers.
results: significant increase antibodies plasmodium falciparum
antigens ama1, msp2, nanp plasmodium vivax antigen msp1 individuals with
past history malaria observed compared not. a
marked increase anti-msp1(pf) anti-ama1(pv) also evident in
individuals 45-59 years (when compared age groups). allele
frequencies two snps genes code il-13 trim-5 found be
significantly different experienced one malaria
attacks within past 10 years not. antibody levels were
classified low-high binary trait, significant associations found with
four snps anti-ama1(pf); two snps anti-msp1(pf); eight snps for
anti-nanp(pf); three snps anti-ama1(pv); seven snps anti-msp1(pv); and
nine snps total ige. eleven snps significant associations 
anti-malarial antibody levels found non-synonymous.
conclusions: evidence suggestive age-acquired immunity study
population spite low malaria transmission levels. several snps in
linkage disequilibrium significant association elevated antibody
levels, suggesting host genetic mutations might individual 
collective effect inducing or/and maintaining high anti-malarial antibody
levels.
