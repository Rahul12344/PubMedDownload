background: artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (as + sp) recommended
throughout india first-line treatment uncomplicated falciparum
malaria. due presence several eco-epidemiological zones malaria 
variable drug pressure, necessary evaluate efficacy this
combination different regions india. objective study use
clinical molecular methods monitor efficacy + sp three
diverse sites.
methods: study undertaken three high endemic sites central and
eastern india. patients uncomplicated falciparum malaria enrolled and
followed 28 days. molecular genotyping conducted merozoite surface
protein (msp1 msp2) differentiate re-infection recrudescence
and dhfr dhps genes monitor antifolate drug resistance.
results: all, 149 patients enrolled three sites. crude cure
rates 95.9%, 100%, 100% ranchi, keonjhar, west garo hills
respectively. pcr-corrected cure rates 100% sites. dhfr, 27% of
isolates triple mutations, 46% isolates double-mutants. most
prevalent mutation s108n followed c59r. 164 l mutation observed in
43/126 (34%) isolates. dhps, (76%) isolates wild-type. only
2.5% (2/80) isolates showed double mutation. dhfr-dhps two locus mutation were
observed 16% (13/80) isolates. parasite clearance time related with
antifolate mutations.
conclusions: + sp combination therapy remained effective falciparum
malaria despite common mutations promoting resistance antifolate drugs.
although prevalence double triple mutations dhfr high, the
prevalence dhfr-dhps two locus mutations low. even isolates dhfr
triple dhfr-dhps two locus mutations achieved adequate clinical and
parasitological response.
