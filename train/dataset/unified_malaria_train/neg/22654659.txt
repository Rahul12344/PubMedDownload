the introduction ten years ago rna interference (rnai) tool molecular
exploration trypanosoma brucei led surge understanding 
pathogenesis biology human parasite. particular, genome-wide
rnai screen recently combined next-generation illumina sequencing
to expose catalogues genes associated loss fitness distinct
developmental stages. present, technology restricted rnai-positive 
protozoan parasites, excludes t. cruzi, leishmania major, plasmodium
falciparum. therefore, elucidating mechanism rnai identifying the
essential components pathway fundamental improving rnai efficiency 
in t. brucei transferring rnai tool rnai-deficient pathogens. here
we used comparative genomics rnai-positive -negative trypanosomatid
protozoans identify repertoire factors t. brucei. addition the
previously characterized argonaute 1 (ago1) protein cytoplasmic and
nuclear dicers, tbdcl1 tbdcl2, respectively, identified rna
interference factors 4 5 (tbrif4 tbrif5). tbrif4 3'-5' exonuclease
of dnaq superfamily plays critical role conversion duplex
sirnas single-stranded form, thus generating tbago1-sirna complex
required target-specific cleavage. tbrif5 essential cytoplasmic rnai
and appears act tbdcl1 cofactor. availability core rnai
machinery t. brucei provides platform gain mechanistic insights this
ancient eukaryote identify minimal set components required to
reconstitute rnai rnai-deficient parasites.
