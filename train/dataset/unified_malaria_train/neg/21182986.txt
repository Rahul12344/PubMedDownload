the merozoite surface protein (msp) family involved initial interaction
between merozoites erythrocytes plasmodium species, members are
therefore becoming major targets vaccine development. considering that
antigens included subunit malaria vaccine accessible the
immune system lack genetic diversity limited polymorphism, we
have analyzed genetic diversity three msp genes (msp-7a, msp-7k and
msp-10) different geographical regions colombia. results showed that
these genes follow neutral model evolution also display low genetic
diversity. strong conservation found msp-7 haplotypes isolates from
geographically different regions suggests proteins could be
good components vaccine plasmodium vivax malaria, thereby avoiding
strain-specific immune responses.
