approximately 200,000,000 people schistosomiasis (schistosome infection).
among schistosomes, schistosoma haematobium responsible most
infections, present 110 million people globally, mostly in
sub-saharan africa. pathogen causes astonishing breadth sequelae:
hematuria, anemia, dysuria, stunting, uremia, bladder cancer, urosepsis, and
human immunodeficiency virus coinfection. refined estimates impact of
schistosomiasis quality life suggest rivals malaria. despite s.
haematobium's importance, relevant research lagged. here, review advances 
that deepen knowledge s. haematobium. three sets breakthroughs will
accelerate discoveries pathogenesis urogenital schistosomiasis (ugs):
(1) comparative genomics, (2) development functional genomic tools, and
(3) use animal models explore s. haematobium-host interactions.
comparative genomics s. haematobium feasible, given sequencing of
multiple schistosome genomes. features s. haematobium genome are
conserved among platyhelminth species others unique s.
haematobium may provide novel diagnostic drug targets ugs. although there
are technical hurdles, integrated use approaches elucidate
host-pathogen interactions infection inform development
of techniques investigating schistosomes human snail hosts and
the development therapeutics vaccines control ugs.
