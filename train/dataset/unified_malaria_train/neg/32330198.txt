malaria, caused protozoan parasite plasmodium transmitted anopheles
mosquitoes, represents major threat human health. plasmodium's infection
cycle anopheles vector critical transmission parasite
between humans. midgut-stage bottleneck infection largely imposed by
the mosquito's innate immune system. micrornas (mirnas, small noncoding rnas that
bind target rnas regulate gene expression) also involved regulating 
immunity anti-plasmodium defense mosquitoes. here, characterized
the mosquito's mirna responses plasmodium infection using improved
crosslinking immunoprecipitation (clip) method, termed covalent ligation of
endogenous argonaute-bound rnas (clear)-clip. three candidate mirnas' influence
on p. falciparum infection midgut microbiota studied through
transgenically expressed mirna sponges (mir-sps) midgut fat body tissues. 
mir-sps mediated conditional depletion aga-mir-14 aga-mir-305, not
aga-mir-8, increased mosquito resistance p. falciparum p. berghei
infection, enhanced mosquitoes' antibacterial defenses. transcriptome
analysis revealed depletion aga-mir-14 aga-mir-305 resulted an
increased expression multiple immunity-related anti-plasmodium genes in
mosquito midguts. overall fitness cost conditionally expressed mir-sps was
low, one eight fitness parameters adversely affected. taken
together, results demonstrate targeting mosquito mirna conditional
expression mir-sps may potential development malaria control
through genetically engineered mosquitoes.
