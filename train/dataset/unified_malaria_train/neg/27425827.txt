invasion hepatocytes sporozoites essential plasmodium initiate
infection mammalian host. parasite's subsequent intracellular
differentiation liver first developmental step mammalian
cycle. despite biological significance, surprisingly little known the
signalling pathways required sporozoite invasion. report sporozoite
invasion hepatocytes requires signalling two second-messengers - cgmp 
mediated parasite's cgmp-dependent protein kinase (pkg), ca2+ ,
mediated parasite's calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (cdpk4).
sporozoites expressing mutated form plasmodium berghei pkg carrying a
deletion cdpk4 gene defective invasion hepatocytes. using
specific potent inhibitors plasmodium pkg cdpk4, demonstrate that
pkg cdpk4 required sporozoite motility, pkg regulates the
secretion trap, adhesin essential motility. chemical inhibition
of pkg decreases parasite egress hepatocytes inhibiting either the
formation release merosomes. contrast, genetic inhibition cdpk4 
not significantly decrease number merosomes. revealing requirement 
for pkg cdpk4 plasmodium sporozoite invasion, work enables better
understanding kinase pathways act different plasmodium stages.
