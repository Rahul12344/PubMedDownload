frozen blood samples 13 species free-ranging birds (n = 65) captive
chilean flamingos (phoenicopterus chilensis) (n = 46) housed outdoors the
chicago area screened plasmodium. use modified polymerase 
chain reaction, 20/65 (30.8%) free-ranging birds 26/46 (56.5%) of
flamingos classified positive parasite genus. dna sequencing 
the parasite cytochrome b gene positive samples demonstrated eight
species free-ranging birds infected five different plasmodium spp.
cytochrome b lineages, positive chilean flamingos infected with
plasmodium spp. cytochrome b lineages closely related organisms the
novyella subgenus. results show chilean flamingos may harbor
subclinical malaria infections frequently previously estimated, and
that may increased susceptibility plasmodium species.
