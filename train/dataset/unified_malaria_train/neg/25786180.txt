antibodies play major roles immunity malaria; however, limited
understanding mechanisms mediating protection major barrier vaccine
development. demonstrated acquired human anti-malarial antibodies
promote complement deposition merozoite mediate inhibition of
erythrocyte invasion c1q fixation activation classical
complement pathway. antibody-mediated complement-dependent (ab-c') inhibition was
the predominant invasion-inhibitory activity human antibodies; antibodies
were non-inhibitory without complement. inhibitory activity mediated
predominately via c1q fixation, merozoite surface proteins 1 2 were
identified major targets. complement fixation antibodies strongly 
associated protection clinical malaria high-density
parasitemia prospective longitudinal study children. ab-c' inhibitory
activity could induced human immunization candidate merozoite
surface-protein vaccine. findings demonstrate human anti-malarial
antibodies evolved function fixing complement potent
invasion-inhibitory activity protective immunity.
