the pathogenesis human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum interlinked 
with timely control gene expression complex life cycle. this
organism, gene expression partially controlled epigenetic mechanisms, 
the regulation is, hence, paramount importance parasite. the
p. falciparum (pf)-gcn5 histone acetyltransferase (hat), essential enzyme,
acetylates histone 3 regulates global gene expression parasite. here, 
we show existence novel proteolytic processing pfgcn5 is
crucial activity vivo find cysteine protease-like enzyme 
required processing pfgcn5 protein. immunofluorescence and
immuno-electron microscopy analysis suggest processing event occurs in
the vicinity digestive vacuole parasite following trafficking
through classical er-golgi secretory pathway, subsequently reaches 
the nucleus. furthermore, blocking pfgcn5 processing leads concomitant 
reduction occupancy gene promoters reduced h3k9 acetylation
level promoters, highlighting important correlation the
processing event pfgcn5 activity. altogether, study reveals unique
processing event nuclear protein pfgcn5 unforeseen role food
vacuolar cysteine protease. leads possibility development new
antimalarials targets.this article associated first person
