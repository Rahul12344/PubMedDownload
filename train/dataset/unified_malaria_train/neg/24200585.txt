tetrahymena thermophila widely used unicellular eukaryotic model organism in
biological research contains 1000 protein kinases phosphatases 
with specificity ser/thr/tyr residues. however, dozen
phosphorylation sites t. thermophila known, presenting major obstacle to
further understanding regulatory roles reversible phosphorylation in
this organism. study, used high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based
proteomics conduct global site-specific phosphoproteome profiling t.
thermophila. total, 1384 phosphopeptides 2238 phosphorylation sites from
1008 t. thermophila proteins identified combined use peptide 
prefractionation, tio2 enrichment, two-dimensional lc-ms/ms analysis. the
identified phosphoproteins implicated regulation various biological
processes transport, gene expression, mrna metabolic process.
moreover, integrated analysis t. thermophila phosphoproteome gene
network revealed potential biological functions many previously
unannotated proteins predicted putative kinase-substrate pairs. data
provide first global survey phosphorylation t. thermophila using a
phosphoproteomic approach suggest wide-ranging regulatory scope this
modification. provided dataset valuable resource future
understanding signaling pathways important model organism.
