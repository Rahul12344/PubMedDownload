whole-genome comparisons provide insight genome evolution informing on
gene repertoires, gene gains/losses, genome organization. our
knowledge eukaryotic genome evolution derived studies of
multicellular model organisms. eukaryotic phylum apicomplexa contains
obligate intracellular protist parasites responsible wide range human
and veterinary diseases (e.g., malaria, toxoplasmosis, theileriosis). have
developed silico protein-encoding gene based pipeline investigate
synteny across 12 apicomplexan species six genera. genome rearrangement
between lineages extensive. syntenic regions (conserved gene content and
order) rare lineages appear totally absent across the
phylum, group three genes found chromosome same
order within 25 kb up- downstream orthologous genes. conserved synteny
between major lineages limited small regions plasmodium and
theileria/babesia species, within conserved regions, number
of proteins putatively targeted organelles. observed overall lack of
synteny surprising considering divergence times apparent absence
of transposable elements (tes) within species examined. tes are
ubiquitous groups eukaryotes studied date shown 
to involved genomic rearrangements. appears different
criteria governing genome evolution within apicomplexa relative other
well-studied unicellular multicellular eukaryotes.
