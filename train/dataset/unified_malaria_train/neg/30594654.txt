pyrimethamine resistance major concern control human
haemoprotozoa, especially plasmodium species. currently, little
understanding pyrimethamine resistance developed plasmodium vivax in
the natural field conditions. here, present first time evidence of
positive selection pressure dihydrofolate reductase locus its
consequences emergence spread pyrimethamine resistance p.
vivax punjab province pakistan. first, examined dihydrofolate
reductase locus 38 p. vivax isolates look evidence positive
selection pressure human patients. s58r (aga)/s117n (aac) double mutation 
was common, detected 10/38 isolates. single mutation s117n (aac),
i173l (ctt) s58r (aga) snps detected 8/38, 2/38 1/38 isolates,
respectively. f57l/i (tta/ata) t61m (atg) snps detected any
isolates examined. although soft hard selective sweeps occurred
with striking differences isolates, predominance hard
sweeps. single resistance haplotype present high frequency 9/14
isolates, providing strong evidence single emergence resistance the
single mutation, characteristics hard selective sweeps. contrast, 5/14
isolates carried multiple resistance haplotypes high frequencies, providing an
evidence emergence resistance recurrent mutations, characteristics
of soft selective sweeps. phylogenetic relationship analysis suggests that
s58r (aga)/s117n (aac) s117n (aac) mutations arose multiple times a
single origin spread multiple different cities punjab province
through gene flow. interestingly, i173l (ctt) mutation present a
single haplotype, suggesting arises rarely spread between
cities. work shows need responsible use existing new
antimicrobial drugs combinations, control movement infected
patients mosquito vector control strategies.
