background: natural killer complex (nkc) genetic region highly linked
genes encoding several receptors involved control nk cell function. the
nkc highly polymorphic allelic variability various nkc loci been
demonstrated inbred mice, providing evidence nkc haplotypes. using
balb.b6-cmv1r congenic mice, nkc genes c57bl/6 mice introduced
into balb/c background, previously shown nkc genetic
determinant malarial pathogenesis. c57bl/6 alleles associated with
increased disease-susceptibility balb.b6-cmv1r congenic mice increased
cerebral pathology death rates p. berghei anka infection cerebral
malaria-resistant balb/c controls.
methods: investigate regions nkc involved susceptibility
to experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), intra-nkc congenic mice generated by
backcrossing recombinant f2 progeny (balb/c x balb.b6-cmv1r) f1 intercross
to balb/c mice infected p. berghei anka.
results: results revealed c57bl/6 alleles two locations nkc
contribute development ecm. increased severity severe disease in
intra-nkc congenic mice associated higher parasite burdens but
correlated significantly enhanced systemic ifn-Î³ response infection and
an increased recruitment cd8+ cells brain infected animals.
conclusions: polymorphisms within nkc modulate malarial pathogenesis and
acquired immune responses infection.
