decades unmanaged insecticide use routine exposure agrochemicals have
left many populations malaria vectors americas resistant multiple
classes insecticides, including pyrethroids. molecular basis pyrethroid
resistance relatively uncharacterised american malaria vectors, preventing 
the design suitable resistance management strategies. using whole
transcriptome sequencing, characterized mechanisms pyrethroid
resistance anopheles albimanus peru guatemala. an. albimanus were
phenotyped either deltamethrin alpha-cypermethrin resistant. rna 1)
resistant, 2) unexposed, 3) susceptible laboratory strain an. albimanus 
was sequenced analyzed using rna-seq. expression profiles three groups
were compared based current annotation an. albimanus reference
genome. several candidate genes associated pyrethroid resistance other
malaria vectors found overexpressed resistant an. albimanus. in
addition, gene ontology terms related serine-type endopeptidase activity,
extracellular activity chitin metabolic process also commonly
overexpressed field caught resistant unexposed samples peru 
and guatemala compared susceptible strain. cytochrome p450 cyp9k1
was overexpressed 14x deltamethrin 8x alpha-cypermethrin-resistant
samples peru 2x deltamethrin-resistant samples guatemala,
relative susceptible laboratory strain. cyp6p5 overexpressed 68x in
deltamethrin-resistant samples peru deltamethrin-resistant
samples guatemala. comparing overexpressed genes between
deltamethrin-resistant alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples peru, a
single p450 gene, cyp4c26, overexpressed 9.8x (p<0.05) in
alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples. peruvian deltamethrin-resistant samples,
the knockdown resistance mutation (kdr) variant alleles position 1014 were
rare, approximately 5% frequency, alpha-cypermethrin-resistant
samples, frequency alleles approximately 15-30%. functional
validation candidate genes kdr mutation resistance marker for
alpha-cypermethrin confirm role mechanisms conferring
pyrethroid resistance.
