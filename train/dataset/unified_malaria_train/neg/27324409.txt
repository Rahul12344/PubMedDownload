malaria parasites synthesize fatty acids via type ii fatty acid synthesis
(fasii) pathway located apicoplast. fasii pathway pursued
as anti-malarial drug target, surprisingly little known role 
in lipid metabolism. characterize apicoplast glycerol 3-phosphate
acyltransferase acts immediately downstream fasii human (plasmodium
falciparum) rodent (plasmodium berghei) malaria parasites investigate how
this enzyme contributes incorporating fasii fatty acids precursors for
membrane lipid synthesis. apicoplast targeting p. falciparum p.
berghei enzymes confirmed fusion n-terminal targeting sequence to
gfp 3' tagging full length protein. activity p. falciparum
enzyme demonstrated complementation mutant bacteria, critical
residues putative active site identified site-directed mutagenesis.
genetic disruption p. falciparum enzyme demonstrates dispensable 
blood stage parasites, even conditions known induce fasii activity.
disruption p. berghei enzyme demonstrates dispensable blood and
mosquito stage parasites, essential development late liver
stage, consistent requirement fasii rodent malaria models.
however, p. berghei mutant liver stage phenotype found partially
phenocopy loss fasii, suggesting newly made fatty acids take multiple
pathways apicoplast giving new insight role fasii
and apicoplast glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase malaria parasites.
