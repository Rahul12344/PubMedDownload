mosquito-borne diseases, well known malaria, among the
leading causes human deaths worldwide. vector control important part
of global strategy management mosquito-associated diseases, and
insecticide application important component effort. however, 
mosquito-borne diseases resurgent, largely insecticide
resistance developed mosquito vectors drug resistance of
pathogens. large number studies shown multiple, complex resistance
mechanisms-in particular, increased metabolic detoxification insecticides 
decreased sensitivity target proteins-or genes likely responsible 
insecticide resistance. gene overexpression amplification, mutations in
protein-coding-gene regions, frequently implicated well. however, no
comprehensive understanding resistance mechanisms regulation involved
has yet developed. article reviews current knowledge molecular
mechanisms, genes, gene interactions, gene regulation governing the
development insecticide resistance mosquitoes discusses potential
impact latest research findings basic practical aspects of
mosquito resistance research.
