chemokine receptors ligands crucial extensive immune response against
infectious diseases malaria, leishmaniasis, hiv tuberculosis a
wide variety diseases. role chemokines evidenced the
activation regulation immune cell migration important immune 
response diseases. outcome disease determined complex
interaction among pathogen, host genetic variability surrounding milieu.
variation expression function chemokines caused genetic polymorphisms
could associated attenuated immune responses. exploration chemokine
genetic polymorphisms therapeutic response, gene regulation disease
outcome important. infectious agents human host alter expression of
chemokines via epigenetic alterations thus contribute disease
pathogenesis. although fragmentary data available chemokine genetic
variations contribution diseases, unequivocal conclusion been
arrived yet. therefore, aim investigate association ccr5-ccl5 and
ccr2-ccl2 genetic polymorphisms different infectious diseases,
transcriptional regulation gene, disease severity response therapy.
furthermore, role epigenetics genes related chemokines and
infectious disease also discussed.
