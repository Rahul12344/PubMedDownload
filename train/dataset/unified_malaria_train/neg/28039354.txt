we assessed plasmodium falciparum drug resistance markers parasites collected 
in 2012, 2013, 2015 3 sites uganda. prevalence frequency of
parasites mutations putative transporters previously associated with
resistance aminoquinolines, increased sensitivity lumefantrine (pfcrt
76t; pfmdr1 86y 1246y), decreased markedly sites. antifolate
resistance mutations common, apparent emergence mutations (pfdhfr
164l; pfdhps 581g) associated high-level resistance. k13 mutations linked to
artemisinin resistance uncommon increase time. changing
malaria treatment practices accompanied profound changes markers 
of resistance.
