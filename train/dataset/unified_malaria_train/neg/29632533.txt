systems biology potential identify gene signatures associated with
vaccine immunogenicity protective efficacy. main objective study 
was identify optimal postvaccination time points evaluating peripheral
blood rna expression profiles relation vaccine immunogenicity potential
efficacy recipients candidate tuberculosis vaccine m72/as01. this
phase ii open-label study (nct01669096; https://clinicaltrials.gov/), healthy
bacillus calmette-guérin-primed, hiv-negative adults administered two doses 
(30 days apart) m72/as01. twenty subjects completed study 18 subjects 
received two doses. blood samples collected pre-dose 1, pre-dose 2, 1,
7, 10, 14, 17, 30 days post-dose 2. rna expression whole blood (wb) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) quantified using microarray
technology. serum interferon-gamma responses m72-specific cd4+ cell
responses vaccination, observed safety profile similar to
previous trials. two different approaches utilized analyze rna
expression data. first, kinetic analysis rna expression changes using blood 
transcription modules revealed early (1 day post-dose 2) activation several
pathways related innate immune activation, wb pbmc. second, using 
a previously identified gene signature classifier, optimal postvaccination
time points identified. since m72/as01 efficacy remains established, a
pbmc-derived gene signature associated protective efficacy a
similarly adjuvanted candidate malaria vaccine used proxy this
purpose. approach based assumption as01 adjuvant used in
both studies could induce shared innate immune pathways. subjects classified
as gene signature positive (gs+) gene signature negative (gs-). assignments of
subjects gs+ gs- groups confirmed significant differences rna
expression gene signature genes pbmcs 14 days post-dose 2 relative
to prevaccination wb samples 7, 10, 14, 17 days post-dose 2
relative prevaccination. hence, comparison prevaccination, 7, 10,
14, 17 days postvaccination appeared suitable time points for
identifying potentially clinically relevant transcriptome responses m72/as01
in wb samples.
