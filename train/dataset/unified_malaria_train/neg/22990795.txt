exoerythrocytic plasmodium parasites infect hepatocytes develop huge
multinucleated schizonts inside parasitophorous vacuole. finally, thousands 
merozoites formed released host cell cytoplasm complete
disintegration parasitophorous vacuole membrane. this, turn, results in
death detachment infected hepatocyte, followed formation of
merosomes. fast growth parasite host cell detachment hallmarks
of liver stage development easily monitored. here, describe 
translate observations assays characterizing parasite development.
additionally, recently introduced techniques tools analyze and
manipulate liver stage parasites also discussed.
