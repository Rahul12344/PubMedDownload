rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) malaria restricted biomarkers 
antibody-mediated detection. however, expression commonly used biomarkers 
varies geographically sensibility immunodetection affected by
batch-to-batch differences limited thermal stability. study aimed
to overcome limitations identifying potential biomarker by
developing molecular sensors based aptamer technology. using gene expression
databases, ribosome profiling analysis, structural modeling, find the
high mobility group box 1 protein (hmgb1) plasmodium falciparum highly
expressed, structurally stable, present along blood-stages p.
falciparum infection. develop biosensors, used vitro evolution
techniques produce dna aptamers recombinantly expressed hmg-box, the
conserved domain hmgb1. evolutionary approach evaluating dynamics
of aptamer populations suggested three predominant aptamer motifs.
representatives aptamer families tested binding parameters the
hmg-box domain using microscale thermophoresis rapid kinetics. dissociation
constants aptamers varied two orders magnitude nano- and
micromolar ranges aptamer-hmg-box interaction occurred few
seconds. specificity aptamer binding hmg-box p. falciparum
compared human homolog depended ph conditions. altogether, study
proposes hmgb1 candidate biomarker set sensing aptamers be
further developed rapid diagnostic tests p. falciparum detection.
