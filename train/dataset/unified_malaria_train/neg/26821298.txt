mixed infections different species genetic lineages haemosporidian
parasites (haemosporida) predominate wildlife, infections are
particularly virulent. however, currently used polymerase chain reaction
(pcr)-based detection methods often read mixed infections. sensitivity 
different pcr assays detection mixed infections insufficiently
tested, knowledge essential studies addressing parasite diversity 
in wildlife. here, applied five different pcr assays, broadly used
in wildlife avian haemosporidian research, compared sensitivity in
detection experimentally designed mixed infections haemoproteus and
plasmodium parasites. three pcr assays use primer sets amplify
fragments cytochrome b gene (cyt b), one cytochrome oxidase subunit (coi)
gene, one target apicoplast genome. collected blood wild-caught birds
and, using microscopic pcr-based methods applied parallel, identified
single infections ten haemosporidian species similar parasitemia. then,
we prepared 15 experimental mixes different haemosporidian parasites, which
often present simultaneously wild birds. similar concentration total
dna used parasite lineage preparation mixes. positive
amplifications sequenced, presence mixed infections reported 
by visualising double-base calling sequence electropherograms. study
shows use single pcr assay markedly underestimates biodiversity 
of haemosporidian parasites. application least 3 pcr assays parallel
detected majority, still lineages present mixed infections. we
determined preferences different primers detection parasites belonging
to different genera haemosporidians mixed infections.
