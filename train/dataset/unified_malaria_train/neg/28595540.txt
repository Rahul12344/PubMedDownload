background: malaria lethal disease causing mortality millions each
year. drug resistance malarial parasite spurred effects discover
effective antimalarial drug targets drugs. objective current study
is identify drug targets malarial parasite. genes unique, non-homologous
to humans essential parasite identified using blastn comparing
genomes parasite host.
objective: open blastp used filter targets specific to
plasmodium species later subjected gene property analysis identify
65 potential targets. screening potential drug targets drug target
properties like virulence enzyme identified three drug targets virulence
property eleven enzymatic nature.
method: thirteen knockouts related potential drug targets already tested 
in plasmodium species, non-plasmodium species rodent malaria, lending
credence approach. 3-d structures 27 drug targets predicted using 
i-tasser server apicoplast import protein tic20 best modeled protein. 
gene ontology studies analysis motifs nuclear localization signal
(nls) established apicoplast import protein tic20 import protein. silico
docking studies used establish druggability apicoplast import
protein tic20.
result conclusion: silico docking studies 3-d structure generated using
i-tasser quinine, chloroquine, artesunate active site apicoplast
import protein tic20 established apicoplast import protein tic20 promising
therapeutic molecular target.
