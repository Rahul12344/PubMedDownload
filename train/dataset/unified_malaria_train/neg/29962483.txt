anopheles (anopheles) lindesayi giles consists 5 subspecies. japan, only
one subspecies, an. l. japonicus yamada, reported. geographical
populations morphologically diverse; however, regarded single
subspecies. study, re-evaluated taxonomic status an. l.
japonicus japan, another subspecies, an. l. pleccau, distributed
in taiwan, comparative morphological molecular analyses based gene 
sequences mitochondrial dna cytochrome c oxidase (coi) ribosomal dna
internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2). nucleotide sequence divergence was
calculated using kimura-two-parameter (k2p) distance model. phylogenetic
trees based coi its2 sequences showed 3 distinct clades: eastern japan,
western japan, ryukyus. sequences ryukyu specimens were
located within clade sequences taiwanese
specimens. regarding coi sequences, 3 geographical groups japan were
genetically distinct. following morphological characteristics distinguished
the groups: larval seta 1-s, pupal setae 5 segments iv-vii, pupal
setae 6 segments iv-vii. based results, revealed an. l.
japonicus included 3 genetically morphologically distinct groups: 2 groups of
an. l. japonicus group ryukyus, synonym an. l.
pleccau.
