in addition used treat malaria, artemisinin (art) used an
anti-inflammatory antitumor agent. study, evaluated effects of
art osteoclast formation activation development breast
cancer cells bone. evaluate effect art osteoclast differentiation
in vitro, treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmms) various
concentrations art evaluated expression genes proteins involved
in osteoclast formation. also performed cell counting kit-8 assays evaluate
the toxicity art bmms mda-mb-231 cells. also performed transwell
assays, wound-healing assays, colony formation assays, cell apoptosis assays 
to evaluate effect art mda-mb-231 cells. also evaluated effect
of art vivo osteoclast bone resorption assay using nude mouse model.
we demonstrated art inhibits differentiation establishment of
osteoclasts even though art toxic osteoclasts. addition, art reduced
expression genes involved osteoclast formation inhibited osteoclast
bone resorption concentration-dependent manner. based data, we
believe art inhibit proliferation breast cancer cells activating
apoptosis pathways, inhibit osteoclast formation differentiation by
inhibiting activation cathepsin k, atpase h+ transporting v0 subunit d2,
nuclear factor activated cells 1, calcitonin receptor, and
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase inhibiting nuclear factor-κb
activation.
