artemisinin derivatives used combination antimalarial drugs for
treatment multidrug-resistant malaria worldwide. clinical resistance to
artemisinin recently emerged southeast asia, yet vitro phenotypes for
discerning mechanism(s) resistance remain elusive. here, describe novel
phenotypic resistance traits expressed artemisinin-resistant plasmodium
falciparum. resistant parasites exhibit altered patterns development 
result reduced exposure drug susceptible stage development
in erythrocytes (trophozoites) increased exposure resistant stage
(rings). addition, novel vitro delayed clearance assay (dca) that
assesses drug effects asexual stages found correlate parasite
clearance half-life vivo well mutations kelch domain gene
associated resistance (pf3d7_1343700). importantly, resistance
phenotypes stable cloned parasites 2 years without drug
pressure. results demonstrate artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum evolved
a novel mechanism phenotypic resistance artemisinin drugs linked to
abnormal cell cycle regulation. results offer insights novel
mechanism drug resistance p. falciparum new tools monitoring the
spread artemisinin resistance.
