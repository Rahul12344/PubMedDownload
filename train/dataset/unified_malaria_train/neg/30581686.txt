introduction: zoonotic malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi currently
become dominant form infection humans malaysia an
emerging infectious disease southeast asian countries. p41 a
merozoite surface protein belonging 6-cysteine family a
well-characterized vaccine candidate p. vivax p. falciparum; however, no
study done orthologous gene p. knowlesi. study
investigates level polymorphism, haplotypes natural selection pk41 
genes clinical isolates malaysia.
method: thirty-five full-length pk41 sequences clinical isolates malaysia
along four laboratory lines (along h-strain) downloaded from
public databases. comparative analysis species, orthologous p41 genes
from p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. coatneyi p. cynomolgi also downloaded. 
genetic diversity, polymorphism, haplotype natural selection determined 
using dnasp 5.10 software. phylogenetic relationships pk41 genes were
determined using mega 5.0 software.
results: analysis 39 full-length pk41 sequences along h-strain
identified 36 snps (20 non-synonymous 16 synonymous substitutions) resulting 
in 31 haplotypes. nucleotide diversity across full-length gene low and
was similar ortholog p. vivax; pv41. domain-wise amino acid analysis of
the two s48/45 domains indicated low level polymorphisms domains,
and glutamic acid rich region extensive size variations. central
domain, upstream glutamate rich region, unique two six (k-e)n repeat 
region identified within clinical isolates. overall, pk41 genes 
indicative negative/purifying selection due functional constraints.
domain-wise analysis s48/45 domains also indicated purifying selection.
however, analysis tajima's across genes identified non-synonymous snps
in s48/45 domain ii high positive values indicating possible epitope
binding regions. 6-cysteine residues within s48/45 domains were
conserved within clinical isolates indicating functional conservation of
these regions. phylogenetic analysis full-length pk41 genes indicated
geographical clustering identified three subpopulations p. knowlesi; one
originating laboratory lines two originating sarawak, malaysian
borneo.
conclusion: first study report polymorphism natural
selection pk41 genes clinical isolates malaysia. results reveal
that low level polymorphism s48/45 domains, indicating that
this antigen could potential vaccine target. however, genetic molecular 
immunology studies involving higher number samples various parts of
malaysia would necessary validate antigen's candidacy vaccine
target p. knowlesi.
