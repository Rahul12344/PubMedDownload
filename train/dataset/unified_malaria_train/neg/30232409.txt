during blood stage development malaria parasite resides membrane-bound
compartment, termed parasitophorous vacuole (pv). reasons this
intravacuolar life style molecular functions parasite-specific
compartment remain poorly defined, mainly due limited knowledge
about molecular make-up unique niche. used silico
down-scaling approach select plasmodium-specific candidates harbour
signatures pv residency. live co-localisation five endogenously tagged
proteins confirmed expression pv plasmodium berghei blood liver
stages. er retention ruled addition respective carboxyterminal 
tetrapeptides secreted reporter protein. although five pv proteins are
highly expressed, four proved dispensable parasite development the
mammalian mosquito host, revealed targeted gene deletion. good
agreement redundant roles, knockout parasites displayed no
detectable deficiencies protein export, sequestration, pv morphology.
together, approach improved catalogue plasmodium pv proteome and
provides experimental genetics evidence functional redundancy several pv
proteins.
