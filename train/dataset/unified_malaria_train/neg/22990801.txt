we describe two improved assays vitro vivo screening inhibitors 
and chemicals antimalarial activity blood stages rodent
malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei. assays based determination
of bioluminescence small blood samples produced reporter parasites 
expressing luciferase. luciferase production increases parasite develops
in red blood cell numbers parasites increase infection.
in first assay, vitro drug luminescence (itdl) assay, vitro
development ring-stage parasites mature schizonts presence and
absence candidate inhibitor(s) quantified measuring luciferase activity 
after parasites allowed mature schizonts culture. the
second assay, vivo drug luminescence (ivdl) assay, vivo parasite growth
(using standard 4-day suppressive drug test) quantified measuring the
luciferase activity circulating parasites samples tail blood of
drug-treated mice.
