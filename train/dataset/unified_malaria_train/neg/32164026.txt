biogeography known shaped diversity evolutionary history of
avian haemosporidian parasites across neotropics. however, paucity of
information exists temperate neotropics especially nonpasserine 
hosts. understand effect biogeography temperate neotropics on
haemosporidians nonpasserine hosts screened ducks (anseriformes) from
central chile presence parasites. forty-two individuals 4
duck species (anas flavirostris, anas georgica, mareca sibilatrix, spatula
cyanoptera cyanoptera) collected assessed haemosporidian parasite
infections real-time polymerase chain reaction screening subsequent
sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. haemoproteus (subgenus
haemoproteus) plasmodium detected 2 host species, a. georgica s. 
c. cyanoptera, leucocytozoon found. overall haemosporidian prevalence was
low (14.2%), prevalence plasmodium (11.9%) substantially
greater haemoproteus (4.8%). six haemosporidian cytochrome b
lineages recovered, 2 haemoproteus 4 plasmodium, 6 lineages
identified first time. phylogenetic reconstruction, chilean
plasmodium lineages closely related south american lineages from
passerine birds known lineages anseriforms. subgenus
haemoproteus known nonpasseriformes never identified any
anseriform host; however, recovered 2 lineages subgenus, one from
each a. georgica s. c. cyanoptera. work needed determine if
this presents true parasitism ducks spillover infection. results
of phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrate unique evolutionary history these
chilean parasites, differing known host group. unique
geography chile, large part country relatively isolated by
the atacama desert north andes east south, would
present opportunities parasite diversification. work needed to
investigate strongly biogeographical isolation shaped the
haemosporidian parasites area. results add growing body of
evidence nonpasserine hosts support unique lineages haemosporidian
parasites, also demonstrating role biogeography haemosporidian
parasite diversity temperate neotropics.
