the development artemisinin (art)-resistant parasites southeast asia (sea) 
threatens malaria control globally. mutations kelch 13 (k13)-propeller
domain useful identifying art resistance sea. art combination
therapy (act) remains highly efficacious treatment uncomplicated
malaria sub-saharan africa (ssa). however, crucial efficacy 
act closely monitored. toward effort, study profiled prevalence 
of k13 nonsynonymous mutations different malaria ecological zones kenya and
in different time periods, (pre) (post) introduction act 
as first-line treatment malaria. nineteen nonsynonymous mutations were
present pre-act samples (n = 64) compared 22 post-act samples 
(n = 251). eight mutations present pre- post-act
parasites. interestingly, seven shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms
were higher frequencies pre-act post-act parasites. a578s 
mutation reported ssa v568g mutation reported sea found in
both pre- post-act parasites, frequencies declining post-act.
d584y r539k mutations found post-act parasites; changes these
codons also reported sea different amino acids. n585k
mutation described first time study present post-act 
parasites, prevalent mutation frequency 5.2%. this
study showed type, prevalence, frequency k13 mutations varied
based malaria ecological zones also pre- post-act time
periods.
