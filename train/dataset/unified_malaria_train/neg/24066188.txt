background: aquaporin (aqp) water channels important water homeostasis in
all organisms. malaria transmission dependent anopheles mosquitoes. water
balance major factor influencing mosquito survival, may indirectly
affect pathogen transmission.
methodology/principal findings: obtained full-length mrna sequences for
anopheles gambiae aquaporin 1 (agaqp1) identified two splice variants the
gene. vitro expression analysis showed variants transported water
and inhibited hg(2+). one splice variant (agaqp1a) exclusively
expressed adult female ovaries indicating function mosquito reproduction.
the splice variant (agaqp1b) expressed midgut, malpighian
tubules head adult mosquitoes. immunolabeling showed in
malpighian tubules, agaqp1 expressed principal cells proximal
portion stellate cells distal portion. moreover, agaqp1 is
expressed johnston's organ (the "ear"), important courtship
behavior.
conclusions significance: results suggest agaqp1 may play roles
associated mating (courtship) reproduction addition water
homeostasis important african malaria vector.
