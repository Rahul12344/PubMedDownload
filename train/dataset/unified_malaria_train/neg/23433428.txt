background: molecular phylogenetic relationships population structure 
the species anopheles triannulatus complex: anopheles triannulatus s.s.,
anopheles halophylus putative species anopheles triannulatus c were
investigated.
methods: mitochondrial coi gene, nuclear white gene rdna its2 of
samples include known geographic distribution taxa were
analyzed. phylogenetic analyses performed using bayesian inference, maximum 
parsimony maximum likelihood approaches.
results: data set analyzed septely yielded different topology none
provided evidence seption an. halophylus an. triannulatus c,
consistent hypothesis two undergoing incipient speciation. 
the phylogenetic analyses white gene found three main clades, whereas 
statistical parsimony network detected single metapopulation anopheles 
triannulatus s.l. seven coi lineages detected phylogenetic network
analysis. contrast, network, phylogenetic analyses, strongly
supported three its2 groups. combined data analyses provided best resolution 
of trees, two major clades, amazonian (clade i) and
trans-andean + amazon delta (clade ii). clade consists multiple subclades:
an. halophylus + an. triannulatus c; trans-andean venezuela; central
amazonia + central bolivia; atlantic coastal lowland; amazon delta. clade ii 
includes three subclades: panama; cis-andean colombia; cis-venezuela. the
amazon delta specimens clades, likely indicating local sympatry.
spatial molecular variance analyses detected nine groups, corroborating 
of subclades obtained combined data analysis.
conclusion: combination three molecular markers provided best
resolution differentiation within an. triannulatus s.s. an. halophylus
and c. latest two species seem closely related analyses
performed conclusive regarding species differentiation. studies 
including new molecular markers would desirable solve species status
question. besides, results study indicate trans-andean origin an.
triannulatus s.l. potential implications malaria epidemiology remain to
be investigated.
