the dominant cause malaria malaysia plasmodium knowlesi, zoonotic 
parasite cynomolgus macaque monkeys found throughout south east asia.
comparative genomic analysis parasites adapted vitro growth either
cynomolgus human rbcs identified genomic deletion includes gene
encoding normocyte-binding protein xa (nbpxa) parasites growing cynomolgus 
rbcs human rbcs. experimental deletion nbpxa gene parasites 
adapted growth human rbcs (which retain ability grow cynomolgus
rbcs) restricted cynomolgus rbcs, demonstrating gene is
selectively required parasite multiplication growth human rbcs.
nbpxa-null parasites could bind human rbcs, invasion cells was
severely impaired. therefore, nbpxa identified key mediator p.
knowlesi human infection may target vaccine development this
emerging pathogen.
