background: study aimed investigating natriuretic peptide b (nppb)
coexpression genes pathways involved heart failure (hf) among
patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm).
methods: microarray dataset gse26887, containing 19 postischemic hf patients'
peripheral blood samples (7 t2dm 12 without t2dm), examined to
detect genes coexpressed nppb using corr.test function r
packet. furthermore, using online analytical tools, determined kyoto
encyclopedia genes genomes (kegg) pathway enrichment analysis, gene
ontology (go) annotation, protein-protein interaction (ppi) network the
coexpression genes. modules hub genes ppi network then
identified using cytoscape software.
results: patients t2dm, total 41 biological processes (bp), 20
cellular components (cc), 13 molecular functions (mf), 41 pathways were
identified. furthermore, total 61 bps, 16 ccs, 13 mfs, 22 pathways in
patients without t2dm identified. groups patients, 17 bps, 10
ccs, 6 mfs, 13 pathways enriched. also identified 173 intersectional 
coexpression genes (63 positively, 106 negatively, 4 differently coexpressed 
in patients without t2dm, respectively) types patients, which
were enriched 16 bps, 8 ccs, 3 mfs, 8 kegg pathways. moreover, ppi
network (containing 237 edges 170 nodes) top module significantly
enriched 4 bps (tricarboxylic acid metabolic process, citrate metabolic
process, tricarboxylic acid cycle, aerobic respiration) 3 pathways
(citrate cycle, malaria parasite metabolic pathway, age-rage signaling
pathway diabetic complications) constructed. decr1, bgn, timp1, vcan, 
ctcf top hub genes.
conclusions: findings may elucidate functions roles nppb gene 
in patients postischemic hf facilitate hf management.
