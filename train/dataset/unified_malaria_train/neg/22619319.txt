the clinical outcome plasmodium falciparum infections ranges asymptomatic
parasitemia severe malaria syndromes associated high mortality. the
virulence p. falciparum infections associated type p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) expressed surface of
infected erythrocytes anchor vascular lining. although var2csa,
the var gene encoding pfemp1 associated placental malaria, was
discovered 2003, identification var/pfemp1 variants associated with
severe malaria children remained elusive. identify var/pfemp1 variants 
associated severe disease outcome, compared var transcript levels in
parasites 88 children severe malaria 40 children admitted the
hospital uncomplicated malaria. transcript analysis performed by
rt-quantitative pcr using set 42 primer pairs amplifying var
subtype-specific loci covering var/pfemp1 subtypes. addition, we
characterized near-full-length sequence prominently expressed var
genes three patients diagnosed severe anemia and/or cerebral malaria. the
combined analysis showed severe malaria syndromes, including severe anemia
and cerebral malaria, associated high transcript levels pfemp1 domain
cassette 8-encoding var genes. transcript levels group var genes, including 
genes encoding domain cassette 13, also significantly higher patients
with severe syndromes compared uncomplicated malaria. study 
specifies var/pfemp1 types expressed severe malaria children, and
thereby provides unique targets future efforts prevent treat severe
malaria infections.
