in dna vaccination, cd4(+) t-cell help enhanced fusion gene
encoding immunization protein foreign gene part providing t(h)
epitopes. study effect helper epitope localization protein
molecule, influence vicinity helper epitope, impact 
chimeric protein cellular localization, fused helper epitope p30 from
tetanus toxin (tt, aa 947-967) n- c-terminus mutated e7
oncoprotein (e7ggg) human papillomavirus type 16, enlarged p30 epitope
with flanking residues containing potential protease-sensitive sites and
altered cellular localization fusion constructs signal sequences.
the p30 epitope enhanced e7-specific response, constructs without
added signal sequences. localization fusion proteins the
endoplasmic reticulum endo/lysosomal compartment, tt-specific t(h)2
response increased. synthetic pan dr epitope (padre) induced stronger
e7-specific response p30 epitope stimulatory effect not
limited nuclear/cytoplasmic localization e7 antigen. results
suggest optimization immune responses adding helper epitopes to
dna vaccines delivered gene gun, cellular localization antigen 
needs taken account.
