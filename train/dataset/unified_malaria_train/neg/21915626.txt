of parasitic diseases, malaria number one killer. despite
tremendous efforts disease control research, nearly million people,
primarily children, still die disease year, partly due drug
resistance lack effective vaccine. many parasite antigens been
identified evaluated vaccine development; however, none approved
for human use. antigenic variation, complex life cycle, inadequate
understanding mechanisms parasite-host interaction host immune
response contribute lack effective vaccine malaria control. 
in recent search genome-wide polymorphism plasmodium falciparum, several 
molecules found recognized sera patients infected p. 
falciparum parasite. here, expressed 350-amino acid n terminus one
of homologous candidate antigen genes rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium yoelii (py01157, putative dentin phosphorin) bacteria and
evaluated immune response protection generated immunization with
the recombinant protein. showed recombinant protein recognized by
sera mice humans infected malaria parasites. partial
protection observed challenge non-lethal p. yoelii 17xnl not
with lethal p. yoelii 17xl parasite. tests using full-length
protein conserved c terminus may provide additional information whether
this protein potential malaria vaccine.
