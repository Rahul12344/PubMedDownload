human malaria important parasitic infection responsible significant
number deaths worldwide, particularly tropical subtropical regions. the
recent scenario worsened mainly emergence drug-resistant
malaria parasites potential spread across world. drug-resistant
parasites possess defective mismatch repair (mmr); therefore, essential
to explore mechanism detail determine underlying cause. recently,
artemisinin-resistant parasites reported exhibit nonsynonymous
single nucleotide polymorphisms genes involved mmr pathways mutl
homolog (mlh) uvrd. plasmodium falciparum mlh endonuclease required 
restore defective mmr drug-resistant w2 strain p. falciparum. although 
the role helicases eukaryotic mmr questioned, identification
and characterization uvrd helicase cross-talk mlh p.
falciparum suggests possible involvement uvrd mmr. comparative
genome-wide analysis revealed presence uvrd helicase plasmodium
species, absent human host. therefore, pfuvrd may emerge a
suitable drug target control malaria. review study focused recent
developments mmr biochemistry, emerging importance uvrd helicase,
possibility involvement mmr emerging cross-talk mmr
components drug resistance malaria parasite.
