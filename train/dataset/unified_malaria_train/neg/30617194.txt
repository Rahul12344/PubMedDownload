although generally curable intensive chemotherapy resource-rich settings,
burkitt lymphoma (bl) remains deadly disease older patients in
sub-saharan africa. epstein-barr virus (ebv) positivity feature than
90% cases malaria-endemic regions, 30% elsewhere. however, the
molecular features bl comprehensively evaluated taking into
account tumor ebv status geographic origin. integrative analysis of
whole-genome transcriptome data, show striking genome-wide increase in
aberrant somatic hypermutation ebv-positive tumors, supporting link 
ebv activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aicda) activity. addition to
identifying novel candidate bl genes sin3a, usp7, chd8, we
demonstrate ebv-positive tumors significantly fewer driver mutations,
especially among genes roles apoptosis. also found immunoglobulin
variable region genes disproportionally used encode clonal b-cell
receptors (bcrs) tumors. include ighv4-34, known produce
autoreactive antibodies, igkv3-20, feature described b-cell
malignancies yet bl. results suggest tumor ebv status defines
a specific bl phenotype irrespective geographic origin, particular
molecular properties distinct pathogenic mechanisms. novel mutation
patterns identified imply rational use dna-damaging chemotherapy 
patients bl targeted agents cdk4/6 inhibitor palbociclib 
others, whereas importance bcr signaling bl strengthens potential
benefit inhibitors pi3k, syk, src family kinases among patients.
