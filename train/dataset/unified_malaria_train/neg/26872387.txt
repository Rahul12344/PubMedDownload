background: burden malaria vietnam drastically reduced, prompting
the national malaria control program officially engage elimination efforts.
plasmodium vivax becoming increasingly prevalent, remaining major problem in
the country's central southern provinces. better understanding p. vivax 
genetic diversity structure local parasite populations provide
baseline data evaluation improvement current efforts control
and elimination. aim study examine population genetics and
structure p. vivax isolates four communities tra leng commune, nam tra
my district quang nam, central vietnam.
methodology/principal findings: p. vivax mono infections collected 234
individuals april 2009 december 2010 successfully analyzed using
a panel 14 microsatellite markers. isolates displayed moderate genetic
diversity (he = 0.68), significant differences study communities.
polyclonal infections frequent (71.4%) mean multiplicity infection
of 1.91 isolates/person. low significant genetic differentiation (fst value
from -0.05 0.18) observed community across river the
other communities. strong linkage disequilibrium ([formula: see text] = 0.113, p 
< 0.001) detected across communities, suggesting gene flow within and
among them. using multiple approaches, 101 haplotypes grouped two
genetic clusters, 60.4% haplotypes admixed.
conclusions/significance: area central vietnam, malaria
transmission decreased significantly past decade, moderate
genetic diversity high occurrence polyclonal infections. local human
populations frequent social economic interactions facilitate gene
flow inbreeding among parasite populations, decreasing population
structure. findings provide important information parasites populations
circulating study area relevant current malaria elimination
efforts.
