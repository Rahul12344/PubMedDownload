background: malaria endemic regions, plasmodium falciparum infection is
characterized extensive genetic diversity. describing diversity provides 
important information local malaria situation. study conducted
to evaluate extent genetic diversity p. falciparum pawe district,
north west ethiopia, using highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2
gene.
methods: atotal 92 isolates patients uncomplicated p. falciparum
attending pawe health centre collected september december 2013.
genomic dna extracted using chelex method analyzed length
polymorphism following gel electrophoresis dna products nested pcr of
msp2 (block 3), targeting allelic families fc27 3d7/ic.
results: twenty-two different msp2 alleles, 11 corresponding the
3d7/ ic 11 fc27 allelic family. frequency isolates msp2 
3d7/ic allelic familywas higher (51%) compared fc27 (49%). majority the
isolates (76%) contained multiple infections andthe overall mean multiplicity 
infection 2.8 (ci 95% 2.55-3.03). heterozygosity index 0.66 msp2.
there statically significant difference multiplicity infection
by age parasite density.
conclusions: results study show p.falciparum polymorphismsare
extensive northwest ethiopia infections composed of
multiple clones.
