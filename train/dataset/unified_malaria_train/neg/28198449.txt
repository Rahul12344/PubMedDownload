vacuolar iron transporters (vits) poorly understood family integral
membrane proteins function iron homeostasis via sequestration of
labile fe2+ vacuolar compartments. report heterologous
overexpression purification pfvit, vacuolar iron transporter homologue
from human malaria-causing parasite plasmodium falciparum. use synthetic, 
codon-optimised dna enabled overexpression functional pfvit inner
membrane escherichia coli which, turn, conferred iron tolerance the
bacterial cells. cells expressed pfvit decreased levels total
cellular iron compared cells express protein. qualitative
transport assays performed inverted vesicles enriched pfvit revealed that
the transporter catalysed fe2+/h+ exchange driven proton electrochemical
gradient. furthermore, pfvit transport function system not
require presence plasmodium-specific factor post-translational
phosphorylation. pfvit purified monomer and, measured intrinsic
protein fluorescence quenching, bound fe2+ detergent solution low
micromolar affinity. study pfvit provides material future detailed
biochemical, biophysical structural studies advance understanding the
vacuolar iron transporter family membrane proteins important human
pathogens.
