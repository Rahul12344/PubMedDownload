background: transgenic mosquito strains developed contribute 
control dengue malaria transmission. one approach uses genetic
manipulation confer conditional, female-specific dominant lethality
phenotypes. engineering female-specific flightless phenotype provides a
sexing mechanism essential male-only mosquito, release approaches result
in population suppression target vector species.
methods: approach uses female-specific gene promoter and
antibiotic-repressible lethal factor produce sex-specific flightless
phenotype adapted human malaria vector, anopheles stephensi.
transposon- site-specific recombination-mediated technologies used to
generate number transgenic an. stephensi lines combined through
mating produced phenotype flight-inhibited females flight-capable
males.
results: data shown demonstrate successful engineering a
female-specific flightless phenotype malaria vector. flightless
phenotype repressible addition tetracycline larval diet.
this conditional phenotype allows rearing strains routine
laboratory conditions. minimal level tetracycline rescues the
flightless phenotype higher found environmental contaminant in
circumstances intensive use antibiotics.
conclusions: studies support development flightless female
technology applications malaria control programmes target the
vectors.
