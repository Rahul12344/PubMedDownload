malaria mosquito borne infectious disease caused protozoa genus
plasmodium. five species plasmodium found infect humans.
plasmodium falciparum cause severe malaria leading higher morbidity and
mortality malaria four species. antimalarial resistance 
major obstacle control malaria. mefloquine used combination with
artesunate uncomplicated p. falciparum south east asia has
developed established mefloquine resistance region. here,
gel-enhanced liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (gelc-ms/ms)-based
proteomics label-free quantification used explore protein
profiles mefloquine-sensitive -induced resistant p. falciparum. thai p. 
falciparum isolate (s066) used model research. data revealed
for first time 69 proteins exhibited least 2-fold differences in
their expression levels two parasite lines. these, 36 were
up-regulated 33 down-regulated mefloquine-resistant line compared
with mefloquine-sensitive line. findings consistent of
past studies, multidrug resistance protein pgh1 showed up-regulation
pattern consistent expected average 3-copy pfmdr1 gene number.
pgh1 eight up-regulated proteins (i.e., histo-aspartyl protease
protein, exportin 1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 8,
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, serine rich protein homologue, exported
protein 1, atp synthase beta chain phospholipid scramblase 1) further
validated expression levels using reverse transcriptase quantitative
real-time pcr. data support up-regulation status the
mefloquine-resistant parasite line candidate genes referred above. 
therefore, gelc-ms/ms-based proteomics combined label-free quantification is
a reliable approach exploring mefloquine resistance biomarkers p.
falciparum. identification proteins leads better understanding of
mefloquine resistant mechanisms malaria parasites.
