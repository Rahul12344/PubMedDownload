understanding molecular mechanisms underlying cellular defense against
xenobiotic compounds main research issue medical veterinary
entomology, insecticide/acaricide resistance major threat control 
of arthropods. abc transporters recognized component detoxifying 
mechanism arthropods. investigated possible involvement abc
transporters defense organophosphate insecticide temephos the
malarial vector anopheles stephensi. performed bioassays larvae an.
stephensi, using insecticide alone combination abc-transporter
inhibitors, assess synergism compounds. next, investigated
the expression profiles six abc transporter genes larvae exposed to
temephos. surprisingly, neither bioassays gene expression analyses provided
any evidence major role abc transporters defense temephos 
an. stephensi. thus decided review existing literature generate record
of studies failed reveal role abc transporters against
particular insecticides/acaricides. review scientific literature led 
the recovery 569 papers abc transporters; among these, 50 involved
arthropods, 10 reported negative results. study an. stephensi and
accompanying literature review highlight heterogeneity exists abc
transporter involvement defense/resistance mechanisms arthropods.
