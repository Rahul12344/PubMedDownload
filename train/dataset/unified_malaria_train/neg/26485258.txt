plasmodium malariae widely distributed across tropics, causing symptomatic
malaria humans 72-hour fever periodicity, may present latency
periods lasting many decades. delayed occurrence symptoms observed in
humans using chemoprophylaxis, patients received therapies targeting p.
falciparum intraerythrocytic asexual stages, investigators addressed
the biological basis ability p. malariae persist human host. 
to investigate interesting features p. malariae epidemiology, we
assembled, here, extensive case series p. malariae malaria patients
presenting non-endemic china, sweden, uk returned travel in
endemic countries, mainly africa. 378 evaluable p. malariae cases, 100 
(26.2%) reported using least partial chemoprophylaxis, resembling pattern 
seen relapsing parasites p. ovale spp. p. vivax. contrast, for
only 7.5% imported uk cases non-relapsing p. falciparum any
chemoprophylaxis use reported. genotyping parasites six patients
reporting use atovaquone-proguanil chemoprophylaxis reveal mutations
at codon 268 cytb locus p. malariae mitochondrial genome. while
travellers p. malariae malaria significantly likely report
prophylaxis use endemic country travel p. falciparum
infections, atovaquone-proguanil prophylaxis breakthrough associated with
pmcytb mutations. preliminary studies, together consistent
observations remarkable longevity p. malariae, lead us propose
re-examination dogma species relapsing parasite.
further studies needed investigate favoured hypothesis, namely p.
malariae initiate latent hypnozoite developmental programme human
hepatocyte: validated explain consistent observations of
remarkable longevity parasitism, even presence antimalarial
prophylaxis treatment.
