background: absence microscopy, plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
proteins 2 (pfhrp2)-based rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) recommended the
diagnosis falciparum malaria, particularly endemic regions. however,
genetic variability pfhrp2 gene threatens usefulness test due
to impact rdt sensitivity. study aimed investigate diversity
of pfhrp2 malaria cases among children ghana.
methods: cross-sectional study conducted adidome government hospital
in volta region ghana. total 50 children mean age of
6.6 ± 3.5 years diagnosed falciparum malaria included. blood samples
were collected complete blood count, malaria parasite identification and
counting using auto analyzer microscopy, respectively. dna isolated 
blood-spotted whatman filters, amplified sequenced. nucleotide sequences were
translated silico corresponding amino acids deduced amino acids
sequences analyzed diversity using mega x.
results: number repeats number repeat within pfhrp2 varied
between isolates. twelve rare pfhrp2 repeat types, two previously
unreported, identified study. hrp2 sequence obtained this
study shared high similarities isolates kenya. using baker's regression
model, group b highest occurring type (58.0%). screening sequences
for epitopes recognized pfhrp2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs), the
predominant motif ahhaadahh, recognized c1-13 mabs.
conclusion: study reports diversity p. falciparum hrp2 samples from
ghanaian children symptomatic malaria. findings study highlight 
the existence extra amino acid repeat types adds pfhrp2 antigenic
variability.
