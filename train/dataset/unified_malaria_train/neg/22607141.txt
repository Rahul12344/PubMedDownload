α-lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid; la) vital co-factor α-ketoacid
dehydrogenase complexes glycine cleavage system. recent years was
shown biosynthesis salvage la plasmodium necessary the
parasites complete complex life cycle. la salvage requires two lipoic
acid protein ligases (lpla1 lpla2). lpla1 confined mitochondrion
while lpla2 located mitochondrion apicoplast. lpla1
exclusively uses salvaged la lipoylates α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase h-protein glycine cleavage
system. lpla2 cannot compensate loss lpla1 function blood stage
development suggesting specific function lpla2 yet be
elucidated. la salvage essential intra-erythrocytic liver stage
development plasmodium thus offers great potential future drug or
vaccine development. la biosynthesis, comprising octanoyl-acyl carrier protein
(acp) : protein n-octanoyltransferase (lipb) lipoate synthase (lipa), is
exclusively found apicoplast plasmodium generates la de novo
from octanoyl-acp, provided type ii fatty acid biosynthesis (fas ii)
pathway also present organelle. la co-factor the
acetyltransferase subunit apicoplast located pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh),
which generates acetyl-coa, feeding fas ii. la biosynthesis vital for
intra-erythrocytic development plasmodium, deletion several genes
encoding components fas ii pdh detrimental liver stage development 
of parasites indirectly suggesting applies la biosynthesis. 
these data provide strong evidence la salvage biosynthesis vital for
different stages plasmodium development offer potential drug and
vaccine design malaria.
