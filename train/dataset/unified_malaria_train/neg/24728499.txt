leucocytozoon parasites infect many species avian hosts, including domestic
chicken, inflict heavy economic loss poultry industry. although
the prevalence distribution two leucocytozoon species (l. sabrazesi l.
caulleryi) reported china previously, many questions
related parasite infection remain unanswered, including population
diversity transmission dynamics domestic chickens. surveyed
chicken blood samples seven sites four provinces china identify
leucocytozoon infection, characterized parasite diversity within individual
infected hosts sampling sites, investigated dynamics of
gametocytemia chickens time. found high infection rates three of
the seven sites. clustering parasite sequences mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase iii (coxiii) cytochrome b (cytb) genes showed lack grouping
according geographic origins individual hosts carrying large numbers l.
sabrazesi strains. monitoring gametocytemia blood samples infected
chickens time showed 'relapse' persistence low-level gametocytemia for
4-5 months, could explored vivo model testing drugs against
liver stages apicomplexan parasites. study provides important information
on population diversity transmission dynamics l. sabrazesi disease
control.
