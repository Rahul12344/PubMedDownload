background: 2014/2015 ebolavirus outbreak resulted 28,000 cases 
and 11,323 reported deaths, march 2016. domestic transmission guinea
strain associated outbreak occurred mainly six african countries, and
international transmission reported four countries. outbreak management
was limited inability rapidly diagnose infected cases. further
fifteen countries africa predicted risk ebolavirus outbreaks
in future consequence climate change urbanization. early
detection cases reduction transmission rates critical prevent and
manage future severe outbreaks. designed rapid assay detection of
ebolavirus using recombinase polymerase amplification, rapid isothermal
amplification technology combined portable lateral flow
detection technology. developed rapid assay operates 30 min was
comparable real-time taqman™ pcr.
methods: designed, screened, selected optimized oligonucleotides using np
coding region ebola zaire virus (guinea strain). determined the
analytical sensitivity ebola rapid molecular test testing selected
primers probe tenfold serial dilutions (1.34 × 1010- 1.34 × 101
copies/μl) cloned np gene mayinga strain zaire ebolavirus pcaggs
vector, serially diluted cultured ebolavirus established real-time
taqman™ pcr performed using abi7500 fast mode. tested extracted
and reverse transcribed rna cultured zaire ebolavirus strains - mayinga,
gueckedou c05, gueckedou c07, makona, kissidougou kiwit. determined the
analytical specificity assay related viruses: marburg, ebola reston
and ebola sudan. tested dengue virus 1-4, plasmodium falciparum
and west nile virus (kunjin strain).
results: assay detection limit 134 copies per μl plasmid
containing np gene ebolavirus mayinga, cultured ebolavirus was
highly specific zaire ebolavirus species, including guinea strain
responsible 2014/2015 outbreak. assay detect related viruses 
like marburg, reston, sudan viruses, pathogens likely isolated
from clinical samples.
conclusions: assay could suitable implementation district and
primary health laboratories, heating block centrifuge required
for operation. technique could provide pathway rapid screening of
patients animals improved management outbreaks.
