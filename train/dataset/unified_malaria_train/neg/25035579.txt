present study reports prevalence distribution pfcrt k76t mdr1 n86y
mutations malaria endemic areas sonitpur district assam. 163
individuals tested malaria, 67 (spr = 41.1 %) detected positive for
malaria infection using rapid detection kit field pcr assay the
laboratory. nested pcr-rflp assay used amplify pfcrt k76t mdr1 n86y
genes flanking k76t n86y mutations. p. falciparum abundant
(91.04 %) among three plasmodium species reported prevalence was
significantly higher compared p. vivax p. malariae (χ(2) = 150.76;
p ≤ 0.0001; df = 2). malaria equally distributed among age groups and
both sexes. hemoglobin contents severe anaemic patients significant 
linear decreasing trend among patients increase age (χ(2) = 4.33;
p = 0.03), whereas non severe anaemic patients exhibited significant linear
increasing trend among patients increase age (χ(2) = 18.38;
p ≤ 0.0001). pfcrt k76t mutation recorded 44 (72.13 %) isolates, whereas
mdr1 n86y mutation could detected 28 (41.79 %) isolates only. 32.7 %
of samples pfcrt k76t mdr n86y mutations. number pfcrt k76t
mutant isolates significantly higher wild type. however no
significant difference observed among number isolates mdr1 n86y
mutant wild isolates.
