transmission-blocking vaccines (tbv) interrupt malaria parasite transmission 
hence form important component malaria eradication. mosquito midgut
exopeptidases aminopeptidase n & carboxypeptidase b demonstrated tbv
potential. present study, cloned characterized carboxypeptidase a
(cpa) midgut important malarial vector, anopheles stephensi.
clustalw amino acid alignment silico 3-dimensional structure analysis of
cpa predicted presence active sites involved zinc substrate binding
that conserved among known mosquito species. real-time pcr analysis
demonstrated cpa predominantly expressed midgut throughout the
mosquito life cycle gene significantly elevated p.
berghei-infected mosquitoes compared uninfected blood-fed controls. high
midgut cpa activity correlated prominent mrna levels observed.
peptide-based anti-cpa antibodies raised cross-reacted specifically 
∼48kda ∼37kda bands, correspond zymogen active forms cpa.
further, addition cpa-directed antibodies p. berghei-containing blood
meal significantly reduced mosquito infection rate test group compared
to control blocked parasite development midgut. results
support development a. stephensi cpa candidate tbv.
