anopheles funestus one major vectors malaria africa. cytogenetic 
studies conducted populations west africa shown variable degrees 
polymorphism genetic structure leading description two
chromosomal forms called "folonzo" "kiribina" exhibit limited gene flow.
because studies allopatric populations showed bionomical heterogeneities, 
present study undertaken three consecutive years (2006, 2007, and
2008) area sympatry senegal, order assess bionomical
characteristics compare epidemiologic role malaria transmission.
overall, two forms coexisted study area; kiribina form 
abundant exhibiting higher biting rates. based enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, anthropophilic rates statistically comparable and
were, respectively, 30.7% 28.6% kiribina folonzo. plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite rates also comparable 2.7% kiribina
and 3.1% folonzo. forms involved malaria transmission; kiribina 
being responsible 68% transmission. thus, due limited gene flow
between two forms, introduction transgene plasmodium resistance in
one two forms could disadvantage implementation control
strategies based use plasmodium-refractory genetically modified
individuals. nevertheless, could represent advantage limiting the
insurgence insecticide resistance gene spread forms be
taken account implementation control strategies.
