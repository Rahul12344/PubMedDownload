plasmodium falciparum capacity escape actions essentially all
antimalarial drugs. atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter proteins known 
cause multidrug resistance large range organisms, including the
apicomplexa parasites. p. falciparum genome analysis revealed two genes
coding multidrug resistance protein (mrp) type abc transporters:
pfmrp1, previously associated decreased parasite drug susceptibility, and
the poorly studied pfmrp2. role pfmrp2 polymorphisms modulating
sensitivity antimalarial drugs established. herein report a
comprehensive account pfmrp2 genetic variability 46 isolates from
thailand. notably high frequency 2.8 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps)/kb identified gene, including novel snps. additionally, 
we found pfmrp2 harbors significant number microindels, previously
not reported. also investigated potential association identified
pfmrp2 polymorphisms altered vitro susceptibility several
antimalarials used artemisinin-based combination therapy parasite
clearance time. association analysis suggested pfmrp2 polymorphisms modulate 
parasite's vitro response quinoline antimalarials, including chloroquine,
piperaquine, mefloquine, association vivo parasite clearance. 
conclusion, study reveals pfmrp2 gene diverse abc
transporter known p. falciparum potential role antimalarial drug
resistance.
