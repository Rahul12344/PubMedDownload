similar thalassaemia syndromes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency highly prevalent areas historically exposed malaria. the
present study, used quantitative molecular methods determine the
prevalence g6pd deficiency population 1508 immigrants denmark. we
found allele frequency 2.4 2.9% female immigrants.
furthermore, mutation pattern studied population showed high
prevalence g6pd a-(202a) variant african african-american
immigrants, high prevalence g6pd mediterranean variant mediterranean 
european western asian immigrants, substantial heterogeneity the
variants found eastern asian/pacific immigrants. inasmuch many the
patients included investigation various thalassaemic syndromes, we
were able evaluate effects interaction low mean
corpuscular haemoglobin (mch) value g6pd activity, particularly in
heterozygous females. activity level markedly influenced mch value
in females normal g6pd activity, heterozygous homozygous
females. comparison patients normal g6pd activity heterozygous
females indicated considerable overlap activity levels. help separating
heterozygous females females wild-type genes, dna analysis is
necessary female activity level 4.0 4.9 u/g hgb
corresponding 50-60% median activity unaffected males.
