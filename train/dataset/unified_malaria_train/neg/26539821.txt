background: chloroquine combined primaquine recommended
antimalarial treatment plasmodium vivax malaria infections six decades but
the efficacy treatment regimen threatened chloroquine resistance
(cqr). single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) multidrug resistance gene,
pvmdr1 putative determinants cqr extent emergence at
population level remains explored.
objective: study describe prevalence snps pvmdr1 among
samples collected seven p. vivax endemic countries looked molecular
evidence drug selection characterising polymorphism microsatellite (ms) 
loci flanking pvmdr1 gene.
methods: examined prevalence snps pvmdr1 gene among 267 samples 
collected pakistan, afghanistan, sri lanka, nepal, sudan, são tomé and
ecuador. measured diversity four microsatellite (ms) markers flanking
the pvmdr1 gene look evidence selection mutant alleles.
results: snp polymorphism pvmdr1 gene largely confined codons
t958m, y976f f1076l. 2.4% samples wildtype three codons
(tyf, n = 5), 13.3% (n = 28) samples single mutant myf, 63.0% of
samples (n = 133) double mutant myl, 21.3% (n = 45) triple mutant
mfl. clear geographic differences prevalence pvmdr mutation
combinations observed. significant linkage disequilibrium (ld) between
pvmdr1 ms alleles found populations sampled ecuador, nepal sri 
lanka, significant ld pvmdr1 combined 4 ms locus haplotype 
was seen ecuador sri lanka. combining 5 loci, high level
diversity, measured expected heterozygosity (he), seen complete
sample set (he = 0.99), estimates individual loci ranged from
0.00-0.93. although pvmdr1 haplotypes consistently associated with
specific flanking ms alleles, significant differentiation between
geographic sites could indicate directional selection local drug
pressure.
conclusions: observations suggest pvmdr1 mutations emerged independently
on multiple occasions even within population. sri lanka population
analysis multiple sites showed evidence local selection geographical
dispersal pvmdr1 mutations sites.
