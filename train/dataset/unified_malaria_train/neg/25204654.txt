the universally conserved kinase-associated endopeptidase 1 (kae1) protein family
has established roles n(6)-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine trna modification,
transcriptional regulation, telomere homeostasis. functions are
performed complex conserved core protein binding partners. herein we
describe localization, essentiality, protein-protein interactions for
kae1 human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. found the
parasite expresses one kae1 protein cytoplasm second protein 
apicoplast, chloroplast remnant organelle involved fatty acid, heme, and
isoprenoid biosynthesis. analyze protein interaction networks both
kae1 pathways, developed new proteomic cross-validation approach. this
strategy compares immunoprecipitation-ms data sets across different cellular
compartments enrich biologically relevant protein interactions. our
results show cytoplasmic kae1 forms complex bud32 cgi121 in
other organisms, whereas apicoplast kae1 makes novel interactions multiple
proteins apicoplast. quantitative rt-pcr immunoprecipitation studies
indicate apicoplast kae1 partners interact specifically the
apicoplast ribosomes proteins involved ribosome function. together,
these data indicate expanded, apicoplast-specific role kae1 the
parasite.
