background: epidemiological control malaria hampered the
appearance parasite resistance anti-malarial drugs resistance of
mosquito vectors control measures. also associated weak
transmission control, mostly due poor control asymptomatic patients
associated host-vector transmission. highlights importance of
studying parasite's sexual forms (gametocytes) involved this
phase parasite's life-cycle. african asian strains plasmodium 
falciparum fully characterized regarding sexual forms' production;
however, latin-american strains characterized. study was
aimed characterizing colombian fcb2 strain gametocyte producer able
to infect mosquitoes.
methods: gametocyte production induced vitro cultured p. falciparum
fcb2 3d7 strains. pfap2g pfs25 gene expression detected fcb2
strain gametocyte culture rt-pcr. comparative analysis gametocytes obtained
from strains made (counts morphological changes). vitro zygote
formation fcb2 gametocytes induced incubating gametocyte culture
sample 27 °c 20 min. controlled anopheles albimanus infection made
using artificial feed system cultured fcb2 gametocytes (14-15 days old). 
mosquito midgut dissection carried analyzing oocysts.
results: fcb2 strain expressed pfap2g, pfs16, pfg27/25 pfs25 sexual
differentiation-related genes vitro sexual differentiation induction,
producing gametocytes conserved expected morphological features. the
amount fcb2 gametocytes produced similar 3d7 strain. fcb2
gametocytes differentiated zygotes ookinetes vitro
low-temperature stimulus infected an. albimanus mosquitoes, developing to
oocyst stage.
conclusions: even history long-term fcb2 strain vitro culture
maintenance, retained sexual differentiation ability. gametocytes 
produced preserved parasite forms' usual characteristics an.
albimanus infection capability, thus enabling use tool studying
sexual form biology, an. albimanus infection comparative analysis and
anti-malarial drug vaccine development.
