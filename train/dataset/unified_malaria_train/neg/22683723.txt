plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase, key enzyme anaerobic glycolysis, been
shown potential immunodiagnostic marker well novel target for
chemotherapy. cloned, overexpressed immunochemically characterized
the recombinant lactate dehydrogenase plasmodium knowlesi, fifth human
malaria parasite. p. knowlesi lactate dehydrogenase (pkldh) gene pcr
amplified 0.9 kb pcr product cloned pgem-t easy vector. sequencing
and blast analysis revealed open reading frame 316 amino acids pkldh
showing 96.8% homology plasmodium vivax ldh around 90% plasmodium
falciparum, plasmodium malariae plasmodium ovale ldhs. pkldh gene was
subcloned pgex-6p1 expression vector sds-page analysis revealed that
about 70% fusion protein present soluble fraction. fusion
protein cleaved prescission protease recombinant pkldh (34 kda) 
affinity purified homogeneity. purified pkldh exhibited high reactivity
with polyclonal monoclonal antibodies plasmodial ldh. polyclonal 
antibody produced purified recombinant pkldh rabbits showed high elisa
reactivity native recombinant pkldh could detect parasite ldh
in malaria infected blood samples sandwich elisa. purified recombinant
pkldh used produce p. knowlesi specific monoclonal antibodies for
specific diagnosis p. knowlesi infection humans.
