background: genome sequencing many eukaryotic pathogens volume data
available public resources created clear requirement consistent
vocabulary describe range developmental forms parasites. consistent 
labeling experimental data external data, databases literature,
is essential integration, cross database comparison, knowledge discovery.
the primary objective work develop dynamic controlled
vocabulary used various parasites. paper describes the
ontology parasite lifecycle (opl) discusses application parasite
research.
results: opl based basic formal ontology (bfo) follows the
rules set obo foundry consortium. first version opl models
complex life cycle stage details range parasites, trypanosoma
sp., leishmaniasp., plasmodium sp., shicstosoma sp. addition, ontology
also models necessary contextual details, host information, vector
information, anatomical locations. opl primarily designed serve a
reference ontology parasite life cycle stages used database
annotation purposes lab data integration information retrieval 
as exemplified application section below.
conclusion: opl freely available http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/opl.owl and
has submitted bioportal site ncbo obo foundry. we
believe database phenotype annotations using opl help run
fundamental queries databases know gene functions find
intervention targets various parasites. opl continuous
development new parasites and/or terms added.
