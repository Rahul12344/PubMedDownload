background: plasmodium cysteine repeat modular proteins (pcrmp) family 
of four conserved proteins malaria parasites, contain number motifs 
implicated host-parasite interactions. analysis mutants rodent
parasite plasmodium berghei lacking expression pcrmp1 2 showed these
proteins essential targeting p. berghei sporozoites mosquito
salivary gland and, hence, transmission mosquito mouse.
methods: work, role remaining pcrmp family members, pcrmp3 and
4, investigated throughout plasmodium life cycle generation and
analysis p. berghei gene deletion mutants, δpcrmp3 δpcrmp4. role of
pcrmp members transmission hepatic stages plasmodium
lifecycle evaluated light- electron microscopy analysis of
liver stage development hepg2 cells vitro infecting mice mutant
sporozoites. addition, mice immunized live δpcrmp3 δpcrmp4
sporozoites evaluate immunization potential genetically-attenuated 
parasite-based vaccine.
results: disruption pcrmp3 pcrmp4 p. berghei revealed are
also essential transmission parasite mosquito vector,
although acting distinct way pbcrmp1 2. mutants lacking expression of
pcrmp3 pcrmp4 show normal blood stage development oocyst formation 
mosquito develop morphologically normal sporozoites, a
defect egress oocysts enter salivary glands. sporozoites
extracted oocysts perform gliding motility invade infect hepatocytes
but undergo development proliferation. furthermore, study 
shows immunization δcrmp3 δcrmp4 sporozoites confer
protective immunity upon subsequent challenge.
conclusions: pcrmp3 4 play multiple roles plasmodium life cycle;
they essential establishment sporozoite infection mosquito 
salivary gland, subsequently development hepatocytes. however,
although δpcrmp3 δpcrmp4 parasites completely growth-impaired the
liver, immunization live sporozoites induce protective immune
responses shown genetically-attenuated parasites.
