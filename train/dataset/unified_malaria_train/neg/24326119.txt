epigenetic regulation plasmodium falciparum genome.

recent research highlighted unique aspects chromatin biology the
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. erythrocytic lifecycle p.
falciparum maintains genome primarily unstructured euchromatin. indeed
there clear role chromatin-mediated silencing majority the
developmentally expressed genes p. falciparum. however discontinuous stretches
of heterochromatin critical variegated expression contingency genes
that mediate key pathogenic processes malaria. range invasion of
erythrocytes antigenic variation solute transport growth adaptation in
response environmental changes. despite lack structure within euchromatin
the nucleus maintains functional compartments regulate expression many
genes nuclear periphery, particularly genes clonally variant
expression. typical components chromatin regulatory machinery are
present p. falciparum; however, appear evolved novel
species-specific functions, e.g. dynamic regulation histone variants at
virulence gene promoters. parasite also appears repeatedly acquired
chromatin regulatory proteins lateral transfer endosymbionts and
from host. p. falciparum chromatin regulators successfully targeted
with multiple drugs laboratory studies; hopefully functional divergence 
from human counterparts allow development parasite-specific
inhibitors.
