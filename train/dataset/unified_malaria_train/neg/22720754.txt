background: several electroporation protocols exist transfect exogenous dna
into plasmodium falciparum. date, however, subjective analysis their
relative efficiencies reported.
methods: time-course luciferase reporter expression used provide an
objective quantitative analysis absolute efficiency three
electroporation techniques; direct electroporation ring stage infected
erythrocytes, preloading erythrocytes novel "double-tap" protocol that
combines approaches.
results: preloading erythrocytes shows mean efficiency 9.59 x 10(-6),
some 5-180 fold efficient matched experiments utilizing the
"double-tap" direct electroporation ring stage infected erythrocytes
alone, respectively.
conclusion: evidence presented provides first quantitative assessment of
both absolute relative efficiencies key molecular tool used study
the biology pathogenesis important human pathogen.
