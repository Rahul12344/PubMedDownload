transgenic reporter lines malaria parasites express fluorescent or
luminescent proteins valuable tools drug vaccine screening assays 
well interrogate parasite gene function. different plasmodium falciparum
(pf ) reporter lines exist, however nearly created african
nf54/3d7 laboratory strain. describe generation novel reporter
lines, using crispr/cas9 gene modification, standard pf nf54
background recently described cambodian p. falciparum nf135.c10 line.
sporozoites line show effective hepatocyte invasion enhanced
liver merozoite development compared pf nf54. first generated pf nf54
reporter parasites analyze two novel promoters constitutive high
expression mcherry-luciferase gfp blood mosquito stages. the
promoter sequences selected based available transcriptome data are
derived two housekeeping genes, i.e., translation initiation factor sui1,
putative (sui1, pf3d7_1243600) 40s ribosomal protein s30 (40s,
pf3d7_0219200). generated characterized reporter lines pf
nf135.c10 line express gfp driven sui1 40s promoters well 
by previously used ef1α promoter (gfp@ef1α, gfp@sui1, gfp@40s). gfp@40s
reporter line showed strongest gfp expression liver stages compared 
other two lines. strength reporter expression 40s promoter
throughout complete life cycle, including liver stages, makes transgenic
lines expressing reporters 40s promoter valuable novel tools analyses 
of p. falciparum.
