background: malaria remains major global health burden despite the
intensification control efforts, due partly lack effective
vaccine. information genetic diversity natural parasite populations
constitutes major impediment vaccine development efforts limited in
some endemic settings. present study characterized diversity investigating
msp1 block 2 polymorphisms relationship allele families 
ethnodemographic indices clinical phenotype.
method: individuals asymptomatic parasitaemia (ap) uncomplicated malaria 
(um) enrolled rural, semi-rural semi-urban localities varying
altitudes along slope mount cameroon. p. falciparum malaria parasitaemic
blood screened light microscopy depleted leucocytes using cf11
cellulose columns parasite dna genotyped nested pcr.
results: length polymorphism assessed 151 field isolates revealing 64 (5) 
and 274 (22) distinct recombinant major msp1 allelic fragments (genotypes)
respectively. family specific allelic types (k1, mad20 ro33) well as
mr observed different locations, k1 abundant. eighty 
seven (60 %) individuals harbored one parasite clone, a
significant proportion (p = 0.009) rural compared settings. ap
individuals higher (p = 0.007) k1 allele frequencies lower (p = 0.003)
mean multiplicity genotypes per infection (2.00 ± 0.98 vs. 2.56 ± 1.17)
compared um patients.
conclusions: results indicate enormous diversity p. falciparum the
area suggests allele specificity complexity may relevant 
progression symptomatic disease.
