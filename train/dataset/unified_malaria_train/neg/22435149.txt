malaria chronic disease caused parasitic protozoa plasmodia species.
four plasmodium species causing malaria human (p. vivax p. ovale, p.
malariae p. falciparum). malaria classifies one serious
diseases tropical subtropical countries p. falciparum represents the
major cause death malaria species. approximately 40% world
population resides areas active malaria transmission. treatment and
prophylaxis measures important reduce morbidity mortality rate of
infection. last two decades, significant number malaria drug resistance
cases (mainly p. falciparum) reported endemic areas choroquine
components. parasite showed enormous amount antigenic variation immune
pressure leading emergence vaccine resistant strains. similarly, drug
pressure allows mutations settle target genes. becoming more
and clearer continuous exposure drug, parasite accumulates
more number mutations genes. artemisinin only
available drug globally effective. review concentrates the
current situation malaria drug resistance including epidemiological
distribution, mechanism malaria resists certain drugs role
of recent advances facilities molecular biology evaluate impact drug
resistance new drug-based strategies saudi arabia.
