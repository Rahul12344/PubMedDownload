plasmodium parasites, causative agent malaria infections, rapidly evolve
drug resistance escape detection human immune response via the
incredible mutability genome. understanding genetic mechanisms by
which plasmodium parasites develop antimalarial resistance essential to
understanding drugs fail clinic designing next generation
of therapies. systematic genomic analysis 262 plasmodium falciparum clones
with stable vitro resistance 37 diverse compounds potent antimalarial 
activity undertaken main goal identifying new drug targets.
despite several challenges inherent method vitro drug resistance
generation followed whole genome sequencing, study able identify 
likely drug target resistance gene every compound resistant
parasites could generated. known novel p falciparum resistance mediators
were discovered along several new promising antimalarial drug targets.
surprisingly, gene amplification events contributed one-third drug
resistance acquisition events. study serve model drug discovery 
and resistance analyses similar microbial pathogens amenable vitro
culture.
