malaria threatens millions people annually burden human health and
economic development. unfortunately terms disease control, effective
vaccines available efficacy treatment limited drug
resistance. genetic manipulation plasmodium falciparum hampered due 
absence robust methods genetic analyses. electroporation-based
transfection methods allowed study gene function p. falciparum,
with low efficiency. lipid nanoparticle developed allowed nuclear
targeting pdna increased efficiency reporter assay, compared to
traditional electroporation method. method first time,
facilitated transfection using circular linear dna p. falciparum
thereby serving alternative electroporation increase in
transfection efficiency. availability robust method functional genomic
studies organisms may catalyst discovery novel targets for
developing drugs vaccines.
