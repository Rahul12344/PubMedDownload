although common plants, proteins currently known localized 
to plastid mitochondrion plasmodium falciparum. one such
protein p. falciparum glutathione peroxidase-like thioredoxin peroxidase
(pftpx(gl)) show, immunofluorescence imaging bioinformatics
predictions, localized apicoplast, mitochondrion cytosol.
the distribution pftpx(gl) random population, protein
localizing one organelle parasites others. has
been proposed targeting organelle occurs via independent pathways
that proceed via golgi. however, pftpx(gl), incubation low
temperature (15 °c) brefeldin treatment reversibly blocked targeting to
these organelles, suggesting involvement novel trafficking route, most
probably via endoplasmic reticulum golgi. idea supported 
by lack cleavage putative n-terminal signal sequence pftpx(gl), 
and n-terminal extension compromise pftpx(gl) enzyme activity. in
the context evolution, common pathway dual localization single 
gene product, primitive endoplasmic reticulum-golgi route, may have
been retained opposed optimization individual organellar import
pathways.
