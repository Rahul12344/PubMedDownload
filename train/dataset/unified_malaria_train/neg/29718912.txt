mosquitoes incriminated vectors many crippling diseases, including
malaria, west nile fever, dengue fever, neglected tropical diseases
(ntds). micrornas (mirnas) interact multiple target genes elicit
biological functions mosquitoes. however, characterization function of
individual mirnas potential targets fully determined to
date. conducted systematic review published literature following prisma
guidelines. summarize information mirnas mosquitoes better
understand metabolism, development, responses microorganisms.
depending study, found mirnas dysregulated species-,
sex-, stage-, tissue/organ-specific manner. aberrant mirna expressions were
observed development, metabolism, host-pathogen interactions, insecticide 
resistance. note, many mirnas down-regulated upon pathogen infection. the
experimental studies expanded identification mirna target 3'
untranslated regions (utrs) mrnas mosquitoes 5' utrs mrnas the
virus. addition, discuss current trends mosquito mirna research and
offer suggestions future studies.
