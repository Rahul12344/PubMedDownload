the emergence drug resistance continuously threatens global control of
infectious diseases, including malaria caused protozoan parasite
plasmodium falciparum critical parasite determinant p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), primary mediator chloroquine
(cq) resistance (cqr), pleiotropic modulator susceptibility several
first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy partner drugs. aside the
validated cqr molecular marker k76t, p. falciparum parasites acquired at
least three additional pfcrt mutations, whose contributions resistance and
fitness heretofore unclear. focusing quadruple-mutant ecuadorian
pfcrt haplotype ecu1110 (k76t/a220s/n326d/i356l), genetically modified the
pfcrt locus isogenic, asexual blood stage p. falciparum parasites using
zinc-finger nucleases, producing possible combinations intermediate pfcrt 
alleles. analysis included related quintuple-mutant pfcrt haplotype 7g8
(ecu1110 + c72s) widespread throughout south america western
pacific. drug susceptibilities vitro growth profiles combinatorial 
pfcrt-modified parasites used simulate mutational trajectories
accessible parasites evolved cqr. results uncover unique
contributions parasite drug resistance growth mutations beyond k76t
and predict critical roles cq metabolite monodesethyl-cq related 
quinoline-type drug amodiaquine driving mutant pfcrt evolution. modeling
outputs highlight influence parasite proliferation rates alongside
gains drug resistance dictating successful trajectories. findings
suggest p. falciparum parasites navigated constrained pfcrt adaptive
landscapes means probabilistically rare mutational bursts led the
infrequent emergence pfcrt alleles field.
