malarial parasites evolved resistance previously used therapies, 
recent evidence suggests emerging resistance first-line artemisinins. to
identify antimalarials novel mechanisms action, developed a
high-throughput screen targeting apicoplast organelle plasmodium
falciparum. antibiotics known interfere organelle, as
azithromycin, exhibit unusual phenotype whereby progeny drug-treated
parasites die. screen exploits phenomenon assaying "delayed
death" compounds exhibit higher potency two cycles of
intraerythrocytic development compared one. report primary assay
employing parasites integrated copy firefly luciferase reporter gene
and secondary flow cytometry-based assay using nucleic acid stain paired with
a mitochondrial vital dye. screening u.s. national institutes health
clinical collection identified known novel antimalarials including
kitasamycin. inexpensive macrolide, used agricultural applications,
exhibited vitro ic(50) 50 nm range, comparable 30 nm activity
of control drug, azithromycin. imaging pharmacologic studies confirmed
kitasamycin action apicoplast, vivo activity observed a
murine malaria model. assays provide foundation high-throughput
campaigns identify novel chemotypes combination therapies treat
multidrug-resistant malaria.
