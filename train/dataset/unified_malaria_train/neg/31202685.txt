crispr/cas9 powerful genome editing method greatly facilitated
functional studies many eukaryotic organisms including malaria parasites. due 
to lack genes encoding enzymes necessary non-homologous end
joining dna repair pathway, genetic manipulation malaria parasite genomes is
generally accomplished homologous recombination requiring presence of
dna templates. recently, alternative double-strand break repair pathway,
microhomology-mediated end joining, found plasmodium falciparum
parasite. taking advantage mmej pathway, developed mmej-based
crispr/cas9 (mcrispr) strategy efficiently generate multiple mutant parasites 
simultaneously genes repetitive sequences. proof principle, we
successfully produced various size mutants central repeat region the
plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein without use template
dna. monitoring mixed parasite populations individual parasites with
different sizes csp-crr showed csp-crr plays role the
development mosquito stages, severe developmental defects parasites
with large deletions repeat region. however, majority csp
mutant parasite clones grew similarly wild type p. yoelii 17xl parasite in
mice. study develops useful technique efficiently generate mutant
parasites deletions insertions, shows csp-crr plays role
in parasite development mosquito.
