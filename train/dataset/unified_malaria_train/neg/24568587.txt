a novel class imidazopyridazines identified whole cell screening a
softfocus kinase library synthesized evaluated antiplasmodial
activity k1 (multidrug resistant strain) nf54 (sensitive strain).
structure-activity relationship studies led identification highly
potent compounds strains. compound 35 highly active (ic50: k1 = 
6.3 nm, nf54 = 7.3 nm) comparable potency artesunate, 35 exhibited 
98% activity vivo p. berghei mouse model (4-day test peters) 4 × 
50 mg/kg po. compound 35 also assessed p. falciparum vivo
scid mouse model efficacy found consistent in
vitro activity. furthermore, 35 displayed high (78%) rat oral bioavailability
with good oral exposure plasma half-life. mice exposure dose 
10-fold lower rat, suggesting lower oral absorption and/or higher
metabolic clearance mice.
