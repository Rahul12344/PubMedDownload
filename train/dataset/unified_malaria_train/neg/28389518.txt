evidence accumulated years clearly indicates antiparasite immune
responses efficiently control malaria parasite infection development
stages, certain circumstances prevent parasite infection.
translating findings vaccines immunotherapeutic interventions has
been difficult part extraordinary biological complexity this
parasite, several developmental stages expressing unique sets of
stage-specific genes multiple antigens, antigenically
diverse. nevertheless, last 30 years major advances resulted in
characterization number vaccine candidates, exploration repertoire
of host immune responses various parasite stages, also identification 
of significant hurdles need overcome. important, advances
strengthened concept induction host immune responses target 
all developmental stages plasmodium efficiently control abrogate
plasmodium infections strongly support notion effective vaccine
can developed. vaccine would critical component programs aimed
at controlling eradicating malaria.
