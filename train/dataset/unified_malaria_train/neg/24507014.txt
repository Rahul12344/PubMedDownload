malaria parasites increase erythrocyte permeability diverse solutes including 
anions, cations, organic solutes, characterized several
independent methods. past decade, patch-clamp studies determined
that permeability results one ion channels infected
erythrocyte host membrane. however, biological role(s) served these
channels, any, remain controversial. recent studies implicate plasmodial
surface anion channel (psac) role parasite nutrient acquisition. a
debated alternative role remodeling host ion composition benefit of
the parasite appears nonessential. channel activity the
associated clag3 genes strictly conserved malaria parasites,
channel-mediated permeability attractive target development new
therapies.
