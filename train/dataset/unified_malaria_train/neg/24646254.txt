molecular, catalytic structural properties glyoxalase pathway enzymes of
many species known. current research focused regulation of
activity expression glo1 (glyoxalase i) glo2 (glyoxalase ii) their
role health disease. human glo1 mre (metal-response element), ire
(insulin-response element), e2f4 (early gene 2 factor isoform 4), ap-2α
(activating enhancer-binding protein 2α) (antioxidant response-element)
regulatory elements hotspot copy number variation. human glo2
gene, hagh (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase), regulatory p53-response
element. glo1 linked healthy aging, obesity, diabetes diabetic
complications, chronic renal disease, cardiovascular disease, disorders and
multidrug resistance cancer chemotherapy. mathematical modelling the
glyoxalase pathway predicts pharmacological levels increased glo1
activity markedly decrease cellular methylglyoxal related glycation, and
pharmacological glo1 inhibition markedly increases cellular methylglyoxal and
related glycation. glo1 inducers development sustain healthy aging 
for treatment vascular complications diabetes disorders, and
cell-permeant glo1 inhibitors development treatment of
multidrug-resistant tumours, malaria potentially pathogenic bacteria and
fungi.
