malaria still major health problem worldwide. study aimed to
investigate hepatoprotective role indigofera oblongifolia leaf extracts
(ile) mice hepatic injury induced plasmodium chabaudi. female c57bl/6 
mice treated 100 mg/kg ile infection erythrocytes
parasitized p. chabaudi. day 7 post-infection, extract improved the
histological alteration induced parasite. evidenced the
decreased histological index induced ile. moreover, ile able increase
the hepatic antioxidant capacity could significantly improve decrease 
erythrocyte count hemoglobin content mice blood plasma due infection.
ile also able upregulate expression 24 genes related metabolism 
and 3 genes related immune response. furthermore, extract able 
to downregulate expression 35 genes related metabolism 82 genes 
related immune response. moreover, microarray study showed ile
regulated change gene expression induced parasite. among these
genes, quantified expression cd209f, cyp7a1, hsd3b5, sult2a3, lcn2,
cci8, nos2, saa3-mrnas. genes regulated ile. therefore, our
results revealed protective role indigofera oblongifolia hepatic
injury induced blood stage malaria.
