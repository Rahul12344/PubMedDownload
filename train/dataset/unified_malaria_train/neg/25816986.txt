malaria remains one world's deadliest diseases. plasmodium falciparum is
responsible severe lethal form human malaria. p. falciparum's
life cycle involves two obligate hosts: human mosquito. initial entry
into hosts, malaria parasites face onslaught first line host 
defence, complement system. review, discuss complex
interaction complement malaria infection terms hosts immune
responses, parasite survival pathogenesis severe forms malaria. will
focus role complement receptor 1 associated polymorphisms in
malaria immune complex clearance, mediator parasite rosetting an
entry receptor p. falciparum invasion. complement evasion strategies p.
falciparum parasites also highlighted. sexual forms malaria
parasites recruit soluble human complement regulator factor h evade
complement-mediated killing within mosquito host. novel evasion strategy is
the deployment parasite organelles divert complement attack infective 
blood stage parasites. finally outline future challenge understand 
implications exploitation mechanisms interplay successful
infection host pathogenesis observed severe malaria.
