antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum mediated mutually exclusive 
expression mechanism limits expression individual member the
multicopy var gene family. process determines antigenic adhesive
phenotype infected red blood cell. previously, showed var gene
switching influenced chromosomal position. here, address whether var
gene transcription follows general conserved pattern long-term laboratory
parasites recently culture-adapted field parasites. activation var 
gene family monitored biological replicates parasite isolate every
3-5 generations 3 months. used transgenic parasites carrying a
drug-selectable marker defined var locus characterize var gene activation
after exclusive expression transgene. transgenic parasites exhibited a
repeatable hierarchy var gene activation fluctuating transcriptional
activity transgenic var locus. transcriptional profiling wild-type
laboratory field parasites showed universal bias toward transcription of
upsc var genes fluctuating transcriptional activity dominant var
promoter. data suggest existence intrinsic var gene transcription
program independent genetic background.
