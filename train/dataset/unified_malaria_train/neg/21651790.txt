background: insects, including anopheles mosquitoes, dscam (down syndrome cell
adhesion molecule) appears involved phagocytosis pathogens, shows
pathogen-specific splice-form expression divergent pathogen (or parasite)
types (e.g. bacteria plasmodium plasmodium berghei and
plasmodium falciparum). here, data presented first study dscam
expression response genetic diversity within parasite species.
methods: independent field laboratory studies, measure dscam
splice-form diversity compared mosquitoes fed blood free 
of p. falciparum mosquitoes exposed either single mixed genotype
infections p. falciparum.
results: significant increases anopheles gambiae dscam (agdscam) receptor
diversity observed parasite-exposed mosquitoes, weak evidence
that agdscam diversity rises upon exposure mixed genotype parasite
infections found. finally, cluster agdscam exon 4 variants become
especially common plasmodium invasion identified.
conclusions: data clearly indicate agdscam diversity increases
with p. falciparum exposure, suggest agdscam diversity rises
further response increased parasite diversity.
