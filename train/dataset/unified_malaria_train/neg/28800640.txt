the genome malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum contains surf gene
family encodes large transmembrane proteins unknown function. some
surf alleles appear expressed sexual stages, others occur asexual
blood stage forms may associated virulence-associated processes and
undergo transcriptional switching. accessed transcription surf genes
along multiple invasions real time pcr. based observation persistent
expression gene surf4.1, created parasite line expresses a
conditionally destabilized surfin4.1 protein. upon destabilization the
protein, interference parasite growth morphological changes were
detected. however, observed strong increase transcript quantities 
surf4.1 sometimes surf genes knocked-down parasites. this
effect reversible surfin4.1 stabilized days of
destabilization, longer destabilization periods resulted transcriptional
switch away surf4.1. tested longer transcript half-life was
responsible increased transcript detection surfin4.1 knocked-down
parasites, alteration found compared control parasite lines. this
suggests specific feedback expressed surfin protein transcript
pointing novel type regulation, inedited plasmodium.
