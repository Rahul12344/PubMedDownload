the malarial life cycle involves repeated rounds intraerythrocytic replication
interspersed host cell rupture releases merozoites rapidly invade
fresh erythrocytes. apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1) merozoite protein 
plays critical role invasion. antibodies ama1 prevent invasion and
can protect malaria vivo, ama1 interest malaria vaccine 
candidate. ama1 efficiently shed invading parasite surface,
predominantly juxtamembrane cleavage membrane-bound protease called 
sub2, also limited intramembrane cleavage. investigated the
structural requirements shedding plasmodium falciparum ama1 (pfama1), 
the consequences inhibition. mutagenesis intramembrane cleavage
site targeted homologous recombination abolished intramembrane cleavage with
no effect parasite viability vitro. examination pfsub2-mediated shedding
of episomally-expressed pfama1 revealed position cleavage is
determined primarily distance parasite membrane. certain
mutations pfsub2 cleavage site block shedding, parasites expressing
these non-cleavable forms pfama1 background expression wild
type gene invade replicate normally vitro. non-cleavable pfama1 is
also functional invasion. however - contrast intramembrane cleavage 
site - mutations block pfsub2-mediated shedding could stably
introduced genomic pfama1 locus, indicating shedding pfama1
by pfsub2 essential. remarkably, parasites expressing shedding-resistant forms
of pfama1 exhibit enhanced sensitivity antibody-mediated inhibition of
invasion. drugs inhibit pfsub2 activity block parasite replication
and may also enhance efficacy vaccines based ama1 merozoite
surface proteins.
