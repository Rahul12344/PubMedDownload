background: piggybac transposon system provides powerful forward genetics
tool study gene function plasmodium parasites via random insertion
mutagenesis phenotypic screening. identification genotype piggybac 
mutants plasmodium genome thus indispensable step forward genetic
analysis. several pcr-based approaches used identify piggybac
insertion sites plasmodium falciparum plasmodium berghei, are
tedious inefficient. next generation sequencing produce large amounts 
sequence data particularly suitable genome-wide association studies.
in study, next generation sequencing technology employed to
efficiently identify piggybac insertion sites genome p. berghei.
methods: plasmodium berghei parasites co-transfected piggybac donor and
helper plasmids. initially, classical inverse pcr method used identify
the existence piggybac insertions p. berghei genome. whole genome
of post-transfection parasites subsequently sequenced pcr-free
paired-end module using illumina hiseq sequencing system. two distinct
methods ('blast method' 'soap method') employed identify piggybac
insertion sites p. berghei genome illumina sequencing data. the
identified piggybac insertions tested half-nested pcr.
results: inverse pcr method resulted low yield ten individual
insertions identified. conversely, 47 piggybac insertions identified from
about 1 gb illumina sequencing data via two distinct analysis methods. the
majority identified piggybac insertions confirmed half-nested pcr. 
addition, 1,850 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified alignment
of illumina sequencing data p. berghei anka strain used study 
with reference genome sequences.
conclusion: study demonstrates high-throughput genome sequencing
approach efficient tool identification piggybac-mediated
insertions plasmodium parasites.
