background: control malaria, caused plasmodium falciparum, hampered 
by relentless evolution drug resistance. artemisinin derivatives
are used effective anti-malarial therapy, resistance to
artemisinin would catastrophic. indeed, studies suggest artemisinin
resistance already appeared natural infections. understanding the
mechanisms resistance would help prolong effective lifetime these
drugs. genetic markers resistance therefore required urgently. previously,
a mutation de-ubiquitinating enzyme shown confer artemisinin
resistance rodent malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi.
methods: here, mutant p. chabaudi malaria parasite immediate
progenitor, vivo artemisinin resistance phenotypes mutations
arising using illumina whole-genome re-sequencing compared.
results: increased artemisinin resistance phenotype accompanied one
non-synonymous substitution. mutated gene encodes μ-chain ap2
adaptor complex, component endocytic machinery. homology models indicate
that mutated residue interacts cargo recognition sequence. natural 
infections human malaria parasite p. falciparum, 12 polymorphisms (nine
snps three indels) identified orthologous gene.
conclusion: increased artemisinin-resistant phenotype occurs along a
mutation functional element ap2 adaptor protein complex. this
suggests endocytosis trafficking membrane proteins may involved,
generating new insights possible mechanisms resistance. genotypes 
this adaptor protein evaluated role artemisinin responses in
human infections p. falciparum.
