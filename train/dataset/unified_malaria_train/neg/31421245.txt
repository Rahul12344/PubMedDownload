plasmodium knowlesi important causative agent malaria humans of
southeast asia. macaques natural hosts parasite, little is
conclusively known patterns transmission within these
hosts. here, apply comprehensive phylogenetic approach test patterns 
of cryptic population genetic structure p. knowlesi isolated humans 
and long-tailed macaques state sarawak malaysian borneo. our
approach differs previous investigations exhaustive use of
archival 18s small subunit rrna (18s) gene sequences plasmodium and
hepatocystis species, inclusion insertion deletion information 
phylogenetic inference, application bayesian phylogenetic inference to
this problem. report distinct clades p. knowlesi predominantly
contained sequences either human macaque hosts paralogous a-type 
s-type 18s gene loci. report significant partitioning sequence distances
between host species across types loci, confirmed sequences of
the locus type showed significantly biased assortment different clades 
depending host species. results support zoonotic potential of
plasmodium knowlesi, also suggest humans may preferentially infected 
with certain strains parasite. broadly, patterns could arise through
preferential zoonotic transmission parasite lineages disposition 
parasites transmit within, rather between, human macaque hosts.
available data insufficient address hypotheses. results suggest 
that epidemiology p. knowlesi may complicated previously
assumed, highlight need renewed vigorous explorations of
transmission patterns fifth human malarial parasite.
