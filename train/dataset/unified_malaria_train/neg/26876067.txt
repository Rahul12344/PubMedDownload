background: plasmodium vivax considered benign increasingly
associated complicated malaria spectrum complications vast
and like plasmodium falciparum. clinical data important respect to
the immunopathological status patient. several genes like vir genes
and pvcrt-o speculated attributing severity p. vivax malaria.
methods: present study carried transcription analysis five
vir genes (vir 14-related, vir 12, vir 17-like, putative vir 14 vir
10-related) pvcrt-o gene severe (n=12) non-severe (n=7) p. vivax
clinical infections studied correlation genes clinical
disease severity.
results: study revealed multiorgan involvement severe vivax cases with
severe thrombocytopenia anemia, predominantly occurring symptoms. four
out five vir genes pvcrt-o showed significant increase expression
levels severe infections compared non-severe infections indicating
their possible role changing pathogenesis p. vivax.
conclusions: increased virulence vivax malaria seems result of
multifactorial parameters changing phenotypically well genotypically.
however studies needed understand still nascent severity p.
vivax malaria.
