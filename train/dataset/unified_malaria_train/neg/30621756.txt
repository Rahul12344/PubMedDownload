background: anopheles funestus among major malaria vectors kenya and
sub-saharan africa recently implicated persistent malaria
transmission. however, ecology genetic diversity remain poorly understood
in kenya.
methods: using 16 microsatellite loci, examined genetic structure an.
funestus sampled 11 locations (n = 426 individuals) across wide
geographical range kenya spanning coastal, western rift valley areas.
results: kenyan an. funestus resolved three genetically distinct clusters. the
largest cluster (fun1) broadly included samples western rift valley
areas kenya two clusters identified coastal kenya (fun2 fun3),
not previously reported. geographical distance effect population
differentiation an. funestus. found significant variation mean
plasmodium infectivity clusters (Ï‡2 = 12.1, df = 2, p = 0.002) and
proportional malaria prevalence different risk zones kenya.
notably, variation estimated effective population sizes 
clusters, suggesting possible differential impact anti-vector interventions in
represented areas.
conclusions: heterogeneity among kenyan populations an. funestus impact
malaria vector control practical implications development of
gene-drive technologies. difference plasmodium infectivity effective
population size clusters could suggest potential variation in
phenotypic characteristics relating competence insecticide resistance. this
is worth examining future studies.
