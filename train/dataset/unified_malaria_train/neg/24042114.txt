innate immune recognition malaria parasites critical first step 
development host response. present, toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) is
thought play central role sensing malaria infection. however, and
others observed tlr9(-/-) mice, contrast mice deficient the
downstream adaptor, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (myd88),
exhibit deficiencies immune function early infection the
malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi, implying another myd88-dependent
receptor also contributes antimalarial response. use
candidate-based screening identify tlr7 key sensor early p. chabaudi
infection. show tlr7 mediates rapid systemic response infection
through induction cytokines type interferons (ifn-i), interleukin
12, gamma interferon. tlr7 also required induction ifn-i other
species strains plasmodium, including etiological agent human
disease, p. falciparum, suggesting malaria parasites harbor common
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (pamp) recognized tlr7. contrast to
the nonredundant requirement tlr7 early immune activation, sensing through
both tlr7 tlr9 required proinflammatory cytokine production and
immune cell activation peak parasitemia. findings indicate that
tlr7 plays central role early immune activation malaria infection,
whereas tlr7 tlr9 contribute combinatorially immune responses infection
progresses.
