the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) structural
family functions acquired immune system prokaryotes. gene editing
techniques co-opted crispr associated cas nucleases allow the
precise genetic modification human cells, zebrafish, mice, other
eukaryotes. indeed, approach used induce variety of
modifications including directed insertion/deletion (indel) bases, gene
knock-in, introduction mutations alleles target gene, and
deletion small dna fragments. thus, crispr technology offers precise
molecular tool directed genome modification range potential
applications; further, high mutation efficiency, simple process, low cost
provide additional advantages prior editing techniques. paper will
provide overview basic structure function crispr gene
editing system well current potential applications research on
parasites.
