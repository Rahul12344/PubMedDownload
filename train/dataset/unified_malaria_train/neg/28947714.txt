the apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) plasmodium spp. merozoite surface
antigen essential recognition invasion erythrocytes.
polymorphisms occurring surface antigen cause major obstacles in
developing effective malaria vaccines based ama-1. objective study
was characterize ama1 gene plasmodium knowlesi isolates sabah. dna was
extracted blood samples collected keningau, kota kinabalu kudat.
the pkama1 gene amplified using nested pcr subjected bidirectional
sequencing. analysis dna sequence revealed nucleotide
polymorphisms synonymous concentrated domain pkama-1. forteen
haplotypes identified based amino acid variations haplotype k5 was
the common haplotype. dn/ds ratios implied purifying selection was
prevalent pkama1 gene. fu li's f values provided evidence of
negative selection acting domain ii pkama1. lownucleotide diversitywas also
detected pkama1 sequences,which similar reports pkama1 from
peninsular malaysia sarawak. presence purifying selection low
nucleotide diversity indicated domain ii pkama1 used target
for vaccine development.
