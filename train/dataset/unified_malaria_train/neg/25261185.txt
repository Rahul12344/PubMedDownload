background: plasmodium erythrocyte invasion genes play key role malaria
parasite transmission, host-specificity immuno-evasion. however, the
evolution genes responsible remains understudied. investigating these
genes avian malaria parasites, diversity particularly high, offers
new insights processes confer malaria pathogenesis. parasites
can pose significant threat birds since birds play crucial ecological
roles serve important models disease dynamics. comprehensive
knowledge genetic factors involved avian malaria parasite invasion is
lacking hampered difficulties obtaining nuclear data from
avian malaria parasites. thus first illumina-based de novo transcriptome
sequencing analysis chicken parasite plasmodium gallinaceum was
performed assess evolution essential plasmodium genes.
methods: white leghorn chickens inoculated intravenously erythrocytes
containing p. gallinaceum. cdna libraries prepared rna extracts
collected infected chick blood sequencing run hiseq2000
platform. orthologues identified transcriptome sequencing characterized
using phylogenetic, ab initio protein modelling comparative and
population-based methods.
results: analysis transcriptome identified several orthologues required
for intra-erythrocytic survival erythrocyte invasion, including rhoptry
neck protein 2 (ron2) apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1). ama-1 avian
malaria parasites exhibits high levels genetic diversity evolves under
positive diversifying selection, ostensibly due protective host immune
responses.
conclusion: erythrocyte invasion plasmodium parasites require ama-1 ron2
interactions. ama-1 ron2 p. gallinaceum evolutionarily and
structurally conserved, suggesting proteins may play essential roles
for avian malaria parasites invade host erythrocytes. addition, host-driven
selection presumably results high levels genetic variation found in
ama-1 avian plasmodium species. findings implications for
investigating avian malaria epidemiology population dynamics. moreover, 
work highlights p. gallinaceum transcriptome important public resource 
for investigating diversity evolution essential plasmodium genes.
