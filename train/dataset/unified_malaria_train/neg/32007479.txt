establishing vitro "red blood cell matrix" would allow uninterrupted
access stable, homogeneous reticulocyte population would facilitate the
establishment continuous, long-term vitro plasmodium vivax blood stage
cultures. study, explored suitability erythroleukemia 
k562 cell line continuous source reticulocytes investigated
regulatory factors behind terminal differentiation (and enucleation, in
particular) cell line used drive reticulocyte
production process. duffy blood group antigen receptor (fy), essential p.
vivax invasion, stably introduced k562 cells lentiviral gene
transfer. mirna-26a-5p mirna-30a-5p downregulated promote erythroid
differentiation enucleation, resulting tenfold increase the
production reticulocytes stimulation induction cocktail compared
with controls. results suggest interplay mechanisms action of
mirna-26a-5p mirna-30a-5p, makes necessary downregulate both
mirnas achieve stable enucleation rate fy receptor expression. the
context establishing p. vivax-permissive, stable, reproducible
reticulocytes, higher enucleation rate may desirable, may achieved 
by targeting regulatory mechanisms fy-k562 cells; promoting the
shift hemoglobin production fetal adult may also necessary. despite
the fact k562 erythroleukemia cell lines neoplastic origin, cell
line offers versatile model system research regulatory mechanisms
underlying erythropoiesis.
