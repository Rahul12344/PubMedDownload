korean isolates.

background: assaying parasitic lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) widely
used rapid diagnostic test (rdt), efficacy serological
effectiveness diagnosis, antibody detection ability, known. the
genetic variation korean isolates analysed, recombinant protein pldh
was evaluated serodiagnostic antigen detection plasmodium vivax
malaria.
methods: genomic dna purified, pldh gene p. vivax amplified
from blood samples 20 patients. samples came five epidemic areas:
bucheon-si, gimpo-si, paju-si gyeonggi province, gangwha-gun incheon
metropolitan city, cheorwon-gun gangwon province, south korea, 2010
to 2011. antigenicity recombinant protein pldh tested western
blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results: sequence analysis 20 korean isolates p. vivax showed open
reading frame (orf) 951 nucleotides encoded deduced protein 316 amino
acids (aa). orf showed 100% identity p. vivax belem strain
(dq060151) p. vivax hainan strain (fj527750), 89.6% homology plasmodium 
falciparum fcc1_hn (dq825436), 90.2% homology plasmodium berghei (ay437808),
96.8% homology plasmodium knowlesi (jf958130), 90.2% homology with
plasmodium reichenowi (ab122147). single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) at
nucleotide 456 (t c) also observed isolate bucheon, did
not change amino acid sequence. expressed recombinant protein a
molecular weight approximately 32Â kda, analysed sodium dodecyl
sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis. 40 p.
vivax patients, 34 (85.0%) positive elisa.
conclusions: pldh genes 19 isolates p. vivax identical, except one
for snp nucleotide 456. observation indicates gene is
relatively stable. based results, relationship antibody
production pldh pattern disease onset investigated
further using pldh serodiagnosis.
