polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) gene
impact sensitivity multiple antimalarials. africa, polymorphisms n86y
and d1246y common various impacts sensitivity different drugs.
to gain insight fitness consequences polymorphisms, cultured
parasites isolated children malaria tororo, uganda, the
multiplicity infection high, used pyrosequencing follow polymorphism
prevalences culture time. 71 cultures, parasites 69 were
successfully analyzed n86y parasites 68 successfully analyzed at
d1246y 3 36 days culture. position 86, sequences 39/69
(56.5%) parasites remained stable (>90% prevalence 2 17 time points),
with 82.1% stable 86y mutation. position 1246, the
sequences 31/68 (45.6%) parasites remained stable, 64.5% being
stable wild-type d1246 sequence (p = 0.0002 comparison stable
mutant genotypes two alleles). defining allele selection ≥15% change
in prevalence first last samples assessed, position 86, 11
samples showed selection, selection toward 86y occurring 72.7% of
alleles; position 1246, 14 samples showed selection, selection toward
d1246 occurring 64.3% alleles (p = 0.11 comparison selection of
mutations two alleles). among 7 samples selection both
alleles, 5 showed selection 86y d1246. overall, consistent trends in
the direction selection seen, although differences statistically
significant. results suggest fitness advantages parasites pfmdr1
86y mutation wild-type d1246, highlighting complex interplay drug
resistance fitness malaria parasites. (this study registered at
