objectives: vivax malaria reemerged become endemic korea. study
aimed analyze longitudinal cross-sectional genetic diversity of
this malaria based p vivax merozoite surface protein (pvmsp) gene
parasites recently found korean peninsula.
methods: pvmsp-1 gene sequence analysis p vivax isolates (n = 835) during
the 1996-2010 period longitudinally analyzed isolates the
korean peninsula south korea, demilitarized zone north korea
collected 2008-2010 enrolled overall analysis msp-1 gene
diversity.
results: new recombinant subtypes severe multiple-cloneinfection rates were
observed recent vivax parasites. regional variation also observed the
study sites.
conclusion: study revealed great complexity genetic variation and
rapid dissemination genes p vivax. also showed interesting patterns of
diversity depending, region korean peninsula. understanding the
parasiteninsula. genetic variation may help analyze trends assess
the extent endemic malaria korea.
