despite reductions malaria episodes deaths past decade, 
still significant need effective tools combat serious global
disease. positive results phase iii trial rts,s directed the
circumsporozoite protein plasmodium falciparum established vaccine
against malaria provide partial protection children endemic areas, 
its limited efficacy relatively short window protection mandate new
generations efficacious vaccines must sought. evidence shows that
anti-parasite immune responses control infection stages as
well, translating experimental findings vaccines blood stages 
has disappointing clinical efforts test transmission blocking
vaccine beginning. difficulties include biological complexity the
organism large array stage-specific genes many the
erythrocytic stages antigenically diverse. addition, appears necessary 
to elicit high long-lasting antibody titers, address redundant pathways
of merozoite invasion, still seek surrogate markers protective immunity.
most vaccine studies focused single antigens apparent 
functional role, likely restrictive, broad,
multi-antigen, multi-stage vaccines need investigation. finally, novel
tools biological insights involving parasite sexual stages mosquito
vector provide new avenues reducing blocking malaria transmission.
