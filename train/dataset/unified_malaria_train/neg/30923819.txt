background: insecticide resistance poses serious threat insecticide-based
interventions africa. fear resistance escalation could
jeopardize malaria control efforts. monitoring cases aggravation of
resistance intensity impact efficacy control tools crucial
to predict consequences resistance.
methods: resistance levels anopheles funestus population palmeira,
southern mozambique, characterized impact efficacy of
various insecticide-treated nets established.
results: dramatic loss efficacy long-lasting insecticidal nets
(llins), including piperonyl butoxide (pbo)-based nets (olyset plus), was
observed. an. funestus population consistently (2016, 2017, 2018)
exhibited high degree pyrethroid resistance. molecular analyses revealed
that resistance escalation associated massive overexpression of
the duplicated cytochrome p450 genes cyp6p9a cyp6p9b, also fixation
of resistance cyp6p9a_r allele population 2016 (100%) contrast 
to 2002 (5%). however, low recovery susceptibility pbo synergist
assay suggests resistance mechanisms could involved.
conclusions: loss efficacy pyrethroid-based llins without pbo 
is concern effectiveness insecticide-based interventions, action
should taken prevent spread super-resistance.
