in mosquitoes, discovery numerous interactions components of
the microbiota host immune response opens attractive possibility
of development novel control strategies mosquito borne diseases.
we focused attention asaia, symbiont several mosquito vectors
who proposed one potential tool paratransgenic
applications; although extensively characterized, interactions the
mosquito immune system never investigated. report study aimed 
at describing interactions asaia immune system two vectors
of malaria, anophelesstephensi an. gambiae. introduction asaia
isolates induced activation basal level mosquito immunity lower
the development malaria parasite an. stephensi. findings confirm 
expand potential asaia mosquito borne diseases control, only
through paratransgenesis, also natural effector mosquito immune
priming.
