understanding malaria parasites gain entry human red blood cells is
essential developing strategies stop blood stage infection. plasmodium
vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes, immature red blood cells.
the organism two erythrocyte-binding protein families: namely, the
duffy-binding protein (pvdbp) reticulocyte-binding protein (pvrbp)
families. several members pvrbp family bind reticulocytes, specifically
suggesting role mediating host cell selectivity p. vivax. here, we
present, knowledge, first high-resolution crystal structure an
erythrocyte-binding domain pvrbp2a, solved 2.12 å resolution. the
monomeric molecule consists 10 α-helices one short β-hairpin, and,
although structural fold similar pfrh5--the essential invasion 
ligand plasmodium falciparum--its surface properties distinct provide 
a possible mechanism recognition alternate receptors. sequence alignments 
of crystallized fragment pvrbp2a pvrbps highlight conserved
placement disulfide bonds. pvrbp2a binds mature red blood cells through
recognition erythrocyte receptor neuraminidase- and
chymotrypsin-resistant trypsin-sensitive. examining patterns of
sequence diversity within field isolates, identified mapped
polymorphic residues pvrbp2a structure. using mutagenesis, also
defined critical residues required erythrocyte binding. characterization 
of structural features govern functional erythrocyte binding the
pvrbp family provides framework generating new tools block p. vivax
blood stage infection.
