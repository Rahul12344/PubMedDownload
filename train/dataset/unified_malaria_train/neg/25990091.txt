viral protein r (vpr) hiv-1 plays important role viral replication in
macrophages. various lines evidence suggest expression vpr in
macrophages causes immunopathogenesis; however, underlying mechanism not
yet fully understood. study, shown recombinant vpr (rvpr)
induces retrotransposition long interspersed element-1 raw264.7, a
macrophage-like cell line, activates reverse transcriptase-dependent
immunotoxic cascades including production ifn-β phosphorylation signal 
transducer activator transcription 1 (stat1). knockout experiments based
on crispr/cas9 nickase system demonstrated cyclic guanosine
monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cgas) stimulator of
interferon gene (sting) responsible ifn-β production stat1
phosphorylation, respectively. moreover, rvpr found increase production of
glutaminase c, regulator glutamate synthesis, also dependent the
cgas-sting pathway. taken together reports glutaminase c involved in
the pathogenesis hiv-associated neurocognitive disorder (hand) vpr is
detectable cerebrospinal fluid hiv-1-positive patients, possible role
of vpr-induced l1-rtp immunotoxic cascades development hand is
discussed.
