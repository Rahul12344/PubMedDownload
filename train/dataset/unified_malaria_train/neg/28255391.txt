despite declining number malaria cases iran, increased prevalence of
malaria supposed due migration eastern neighboring countries 
iran, abundant plasmodium vivax (p. vivax). circumsporozoite
protein (csp) p. vivax, one candidate antigens antimalaria
vaccine. diversity p. vivax populations circulating iran been
investigated using circumsporozoite protein (csp) study. hundred and
eighteen blood samples collected patients diagnosed p. vivax
malaria south iran 2007-2008. samples analyzed using
nested pcr/ rflp 18 sequenced. genotyping pvcsp gene showed that
vk210 type predominant (95%) south iran. sequence analysis pvcsp
gene revealed 6 distinct allelic variants vk210 type. present data
indicate degree genetic diversity among p. vivax
populations hormozgan province iran. seems neighbors iran,
vk210 type predominant, probably due similar vector malaria these
regions.
