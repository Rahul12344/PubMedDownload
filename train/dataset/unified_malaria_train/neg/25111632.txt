malaria, infectious disease caused eukaryotic parasites genus
plasmodium, afflicts hundreds millions people every year. parasite
and host utilize protein kinases regulate essential cellular processes.
bioinformatic analyses parasite genomes predict least 65 protein kinases,
but biological functions therapeutic potential largely unknown. 
profiled 1358 small-molecule kinase inhibitors evaluate role the
human malaria kinomes plasmodium infection liver cells, the
parasites' obligatory transient developmental stage precedes the
symptomatic blood stage. screen identified several small molecules that
inhibit parasite load liver cells, nanomolar efficacy, each
compound subsequently assessed activity blood-stage malaria. most
of screening hits inhibited liver- blood-stage malaria parasites,
which dissimilar gene expression profiles infect different host cells.
evaluation existing kinase activity profiling data library members
suggests several kinases essential malaria parasites, including
cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), glycogen synthase kinases, and
phosphoinositide-3-kinases. cdk inhibitors found bind plasmodium
protein kinase 5, likely compounds target multiple parasite 
kinases. dual-stage inhibition identified kinase inhibitors makes them
useful chemical probes promising starting points antimalarial
development.
