rna interference (rnai) quickly proven immensely useful tool for
studying gene function validation potential drug targets almost all
organisms possess required set proteins interference pathway. 
in protozoan parasites like plasmodium, toxoplasma, entamoeba, giardia,
trypanosoma, leishmania, set enzymes represented divergently.
hitherto, rnai-related genes like dicer argonaute identified 
plasmodium leishmania species, respectively. however, non-canonical
rnai-related pathways might present parasites, recently
demonstrated plasmodium. review, discuss existing challenges and
future directions developing rnai tool studying gene function as
a possible clinical application plasmodium.
