recent literature suggested important function native amyloid precursor
protein (app) amine oxidase implicating protection brain cells from
catecholamine-induced toxicity. however, role catecholamines regulation
of native app explored. report dopamine (da), one of
the prominent catecholamine neurotransmitters brain, down-modulates
native app protein several neuronal cell types. using sh-sy5y cells model, 
we detected alteration transcript expression unaffected translation
suggested da might induce app degradation. actually found da
treatment decreased stability app. lysosomal blockers inhibited da-induced
app degradation, specific proteasomal blocker failed so. detected
the role cathepsin b da-induced app degradation using pharmacological
inhibitor specific sirna. also revealed da could increase cathepsin b
expression transcript protein levels. using antioxidant n-acetyl
cysteine, detected increased level reactive oxygen species generation 
was found responsible induced cathepsin b expression da resultant app 
degradation. study reveals existence reciprocal regulation a
catecholamine amine oxidase implicating brain catecholamine
homeostasis.
