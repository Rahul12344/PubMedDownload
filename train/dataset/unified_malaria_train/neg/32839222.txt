delayed clearance plasmodium falciparum artemisinin-based combination
therapies (acts) already observed african isolates. here, aimed to
investigate prevalence polymorphisms two genes correlated delayed 
parasite clearance, p. falciparum kelch 13 (pfk13) ubiquitin-specific
protease 1 (pfubp1), among returning travellers african countries reported
in eastern china provide baseline data antimalarial drug resistance
(art) surveillance evaluation. total 153 filter-paper blood spots
collected 2017-2019 uncomplicated p. falciparum cases anhui and
shandong provinces included study. among them, 3.3% (5/153) the
isolates carried pfk13 mutations, 3 harboured synonymous
mutation, c469c. total 13.1% (20/153) isolates found contain 
pfubp1 mutations, non-synonymous. pfubp1 genotypes associated
with art resistance occurred study included e1528d (6.5%, 10/153)
and d1525e (2.6%, 4/153). however, high prevalence previously unreported
mutation e1531d (5.9%, 9/153) also detected. addition, 2 types of
deletions (encoding kid kie, respectively) 2 types insertions
(encoding kye kydkyd, respectively) found 16 isolates 6 isolates,
respectively. study showed limited variation pfk13 among returning
travellers african countries suggested potential molecular
markers, pfubp1, use surveillance african isolates act
susceptibility studies. clinical trials research way to
investigate pfk13 pfubp1 mutations, well candidate
molecular markers, roles delaying parasite clearance.
