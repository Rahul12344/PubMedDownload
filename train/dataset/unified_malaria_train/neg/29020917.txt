background: asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus highly invasive
species competent vector several arboviruses (e.g. dengue, chikungunya,
zika) parasites (e.g. dirofilaria) public health importance. compared to
other mosquito species, ae. albopictus females exhibit generalist host seeking 
as well aggressive biting behaviour responsible high
degree nuisance. several complex mosquito behaviours host seeking,
feeding, mating oviposition rely olfactory stimuli target range of
sensory neurons localized mainly specialized head appendages antennae,
maxillary palps mouthparts.
results: aim describe ae. albopictus olfactory repertoire have
used rna-seq reveal transcriptome profiles female antennae and
maxillary palps. male heads whole female bodies employed reference
for differential expression analysis. relative transcript abundance within
each tissue (tpm, transcripts per kilobase per million) pairwise
differential abundance different tissues (fold change values false
discovery rates) evaluated. contigs upregulated antennae (620) and
maxillary palps (268) identified relative go pfam enrichment
profiles analysed. chemosensory genes described: overall, 77 odorant binding
proteins (obp), 82 odorant receptors (or), 60 ionotropic receptors (ir) 30
gustatory receptors (gr) identified comparative genomics and
transcriptomics. addition, orthologs genes expressed female/male
maxillary palps and/or antennae involved thermosensation (e.g. pyrexia and
arrestin1), mechanosensation (e.g. piezo painless) neuromodulation were
classified.
conclusions: provide first detailed transcriptome main ae.
albopictus sensory appendages, i.e. antennae maxillary palps. deeper
knowledge olfactory repertoire tiger mosquito help better
understand biology may pave way design new attractants/repellents.
