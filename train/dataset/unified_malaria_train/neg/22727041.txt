background: first natural infection plasmodium knowlesi humans was
recorded 1965 peninsular malaysia. extensive research conducted
and postulated rare incident simian malaria will
not easily transmitted humans. however, turn 21st century,
knowlesi malaria prevalent throughout southeast asia life threatening.
thus, longitudinal study initiated determine vectors, seasonal
variation preference humans macaques.
methods: monthly mosquito collections carried kuala lipis, pahang,
peninsular malaysia, using human-landing collection monkey-baited traps at
ground canopy levels. mosquitoes identified anopheline
mosquitoes dissected gut gland examined oocysts and
sporozoites. nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) conducted positive
samples, followed sequencing csp gene.
results discussion: anopheles cracens predominant mosquito biting
humans well macaques. comprised 63.2% total collection and
was species positive sporozoites p. knowlesi. exophagic
and enter houses. besides an. cracens, anopheles kochi also found 
the monkey-bait trap. species preferred bite monkeys ground level
compared canopy.
conclusion: anopheles cracens, belongs dirus complex, leucosphyrus
subgroup, leucosphyrus group mosquitoes, confirmed only
vector site pahang study. predominant
mosquito study sites deforestation humans villages are
entering deeper forests, nearer mosquitoes macacques. the
close association humans macaques mosquitoes led zoonotic
transmission malaria.
