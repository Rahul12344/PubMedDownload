protein kinases (pks) class druggable targets trypanosoma brucei, the
causative agent human african trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), yet little 
is known pks essential survival mammals. recent
kinome-wide rnai screen 176 individual bloodstream form trypanosoma brucei
lines identified pks required proliferation culture. order assess
which pks also potential virulence factors essential vivo, lines were
pooled, inoculated mice, screened loss fitness 48â€‰h rnai.
the presence trypanosomes bloodstream assessed using rnai target
sequencing (ritseq) compared growth culture. identified 49 pks 
a significant loss fitness vivo two independent experiments, a
strong correlation vitro vivo loss fitness majority.
nine pks pronounced growth defect vivo, vitro. amongst
these pks several putative functions related stress responses
mediated pi3k/tor mapk signaling cascades, act protect
the parasite complement-mediated osmotic lysis. identification 
virulence-associated pks provides new insights t. brucei-host interaction
and reveals novel potential protein kinase drug targets.
