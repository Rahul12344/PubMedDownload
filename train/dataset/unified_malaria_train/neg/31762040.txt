natural killer cells employ diverse arsenal effector mechanisms target
intracellular pathogens. differentiation natural killer (nk) cell activation
pathways occurs along continuum reliance innate pro-inflammatory
cytokines stress-induced host ligands interaction signals
derived acquired immune responses. importantly, degree functional
differentiation nk cell lineage influences magnitude specificity
of interactions host cells infected viruses, bacteria, fungi, and
parasites. individual humans possess vast diversity distinct nk cell clones,
each capacity vary along functional differentiation pathway,
which - combined - results unique individual responses different
infections. summarize nk cell differentiation events, review
evidence direct interaction malaria-infected host cells nk cells 
assess innate inflammatory signals induced malaria parasite-associated
molecular patterns influence indirect activation function nk cells.
finally, discuss evidence anti-malarial immunity develops parallel
with advancing nk differentiation, coincident loss reliance on
inflammatory signals, refined capacity nk cells target malaria
parasites precisely, particularly antibody-dependent mechanisms.
