background: peroxisomes ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles that
compartmentalize variety metabolic pathways primarily related to
the oxidative metabolism lipids detoxification reactive oxygen
species. importance peroxisomes underscored serious human diseases, 
which caused disorders peroxisomal functions. eukaryotic lineages,
however, lost peroxisomes. organisms mainly anaerobic protists some
parasitic lineages including plasmodium parasitic platyhelminths. we
performed systematic in-silico analysis peroxisomal markers among metazoans 
to assess presence peroxisomes peroxisomal enzymes.
results: analyses reveal obvious loss peroxisomes tested flukes,
tapeworms, parasitic roundworms order trichocephalida. intriguingly,
peroxisomal markers absent genome free-living tunicate
oikopleura dioica, inhabits oxygen-containing niches sea waters. we
further map presence predicted subcellular localization putative
peroxisomal enzymes, showing organisms without peroxisomal markers
the set enzymes highly reduced none contains predicted 
peroxisomal targeting signal.
conclusions: shown several lineages metazoans independently lost 
peroxisomes loss peroxisomes exclusively associated 
adaptation anaerobic habitats parasitic lifestyle. although reason
for loss peroxisomes o. dioica unclear, organisms lacking
peroxisomes, including free-living o. dioica, share certain typical
r-selected traits: high fecundity, limited ontogenesis relatively low
complexity gene content. hypothesize peroxisomes generally the
first compartment lost evolutionary reductions eukaryotic
cell.
