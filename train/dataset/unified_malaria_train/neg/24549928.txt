juzen-taiho-to immunostimulatory herbal formulation clinically used
in east asia cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy radiation. the
formulation stimulates various leukocytes, including t, b, nk cells and
macrophages. although juzen-taiho-to known contain numerous compounds 
various pharmacological activities, clear compounds are
responsible stimulation individual cell types. here, conducted what
we call "biomarker-guided screening" purify compounds responsible the
macrophages stimulatory activity. end, gene expression analyzed 
dna array macrophages treated juzen-taiho-to dmso (vehicle control),
which identified intercellular adhesion molecule 1 biomarker macrophage
stimulation juzen-taiho-to. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction assay intercellular adhesion molecule 1 used guide 
the purification active compounds. screening resulted purification 
of glycolipid mixture, containing β-glucosylceramides. glycolipid mixture
potently stimulated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression primary
dendritic cells well primary cd14+ (macrophages) cells. the
identification glycolipid mixture opens opportunity further
studies understand plant-derived glycolipids stimulate macrophages and
dendritic cells safe effective manner demonstrated juzen-taiho-to.
