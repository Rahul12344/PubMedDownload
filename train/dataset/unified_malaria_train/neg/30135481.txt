artemisinin rapidly effective drug plasmodium falciparum malaria 
treatment currently clinical use. emerging artemisinin-resistant parasites
pose great global health risk. present, level artemisinin resistance 
is still relatively low evidence pointing towards trade-off between
artemisinin resistance fitness loss. show artemisinin-resistant 
p. falciparum isolates cambodia manifested fitness loss, showing fewer
progenies intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle. loss fitness 
was exacerbated condition low exogenous amino acid supply. the
resistant parasites failed undergo maturation, whereas drug-sensitive
counterparts able complete erythrocytic cycle conditions of
amino acid deprivation. artemisinin-resistant phenotype stable, and
loss phenotype associated changes expression putative
target, exp1, membrane glutathione transferase. analysis snps haemoglobin
processing genes revealed associations parasite clearance times, suggesting 
changes haemoglobin catabolism may contribute artemisinin resistance. these
findings fitness protein homeostasis could provide clues contain
emerging artemisinin-resistant parasites.
