background: fight malaria caused plasmodium falciparum, the
successes achieved artemisinin endangered resistance parasites 
to drug. whole genome sequencing approach artemisinin resistant parasite
line discovered k13 gene associated drug resistance. vitro vivo
studies indicated mutations k13 gene linked artemisinin
resistance.
methodology: literatures published april, 2015 december, 2016 
k13 mutant alleles artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum and
relevant literatures comprehensively reviewed.
results: date, 13 non-synonymous mutations k13 gene observed to
have slow parasite clearance. worldwide mapping k13 mutant alleles shown 
mutants associated artemisinin resistance confined southeast asia
and china invade african countries. although vitro ring stage
survival assay 0-3 h recently developed assay, useful rapid
detection artemisinin resistance associated k13 allelic marker the
parasite. recently, dissemination k13 mutant alleles recommended be
investigated identity haplotypes. significant characteristics well
described alleles reports mentioned review benefit of
future studies.
conclusion: according updates review, concluded
artemisinin resistance disseminate india african countries within
short period whereas regular tracking mutants necessary.
