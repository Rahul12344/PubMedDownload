plasmodium falciparum causes lethal form human malaria a
global health concern. parasite responds antimalarial therapies by
developing drug resistance. continuous development new antimalarials 
novel mechanisms action priority drug combination therapies. use 
of transition-state analog inhibitors block essential steps purine salvage 
has proposed new antimalarial approach. mutations reduce
transition-state analog binding also expected reduce essential
catalytic function target. previously reported inhibition 
host p. falciparum purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pfpnp) by
dadme-immucillin-g (dadme-immg) causes purine starvation parasite death in
vitro primate infection models. p. falciparum cultured incremental
dadme-immg drug pressure initially exhibited increased pfpnp gene copy number and
protein expression. increased drug pressure, additional pfpnp gene copies
appeared point mutations catalytic site residues involved drug
binding. mutant pfpnps resistant clones demonstrated reduced affinity for
dadme-immg, also reduced catalytic efficiency. catalytic defects were
partially overcome gene amplification region expressing pfpnp. crystal 
structures native mutated pfpnps demonstrate altered catalytic site
contacts dadme-immg. point mutations gene amplification required 
to overcome purine starvation induced dadme-immg. resistance developed slowly,
over 136 generations (2136 clonal selection). transition-state analog inhibitors 
against pfpnp slow induce resistance may promise malaria
therapy.
