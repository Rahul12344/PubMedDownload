background: mutational analysis plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene 
is routinely performed track emergence spread artemisinin
resistance. surveillance resistance markers impeded difficulty
of extracting sufficient dna low parasite density infections common in
low-transmission settings, southeast asia. problem overcome
by collecting large volumes venous blood. efficient methods extracting and
amplifying k13 dried blood spots (dbs) would facilitate resistance
surveillance.
methods: methods k13 amplification standard whatman 3mm dbs (stored 
14 days 28 °c 80% relative humidity) optimized systematically
testing different extraction conditions. conditions improved parasite dna
recovery assessed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) 18s rdna 
were tested impact k13 pcr amplification.
results: optimized protocol amplification k13 dbs markedly
more sensitive standard methods using commercial kits. using method,
k13 successfully amplified laboratory-created dbs samples parasite 
densities low 500 parasites/ml. importantly, method recovers dna
and rna, making compatible rna-based ultrasensitive techniques currently 
in use.
conclusions: optimized dbs protocol facilitate drug resistance
surveillance, especially low-transmission settings clinical malaria
infections high parasite densities rare.
