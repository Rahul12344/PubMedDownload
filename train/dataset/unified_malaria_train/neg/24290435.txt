amongst host genetic factors, cytokine gene polymorphism anticipated be
an important factor qualitative, quantitative time secretion play an
important role disease outcome. investigated association cytokine
promoter snps risk plasmodium falciparum malaria disease severity 
a case control study malaria endemic karbi anglong district assam, india.
frequency il-8-251t/a (p=0.03 p=0.01) tgf-β1-509c/t (p=0.02 and
p=0.03) higher malaria comparison control participants and
non-malarial fever controls. interestingly, higher frequency mutant allele
of il-10-819t/c observed non-malarial fever controls compared malaria
thus suggesting role distinguishing marker two disease groups.
higher il-8 expression increased frequency il-8-251t/a complicated
malaria (p=0.002) reported indicating role susceptibility to
complicated malaria. conclusion, study suggests role mutant
genotype il-8-251t/a marker complicated malaria population.
surprisingly, decreased expression tgf-β1 uncomplicated malaria even in
presence high expressing mutant genotype observed needs be
investigated context pool activated cells producing cytokine.
