background: plasmodium vivax resistance chloroquine (cq) reported
from many endemic regions world. plasmodium vivax responsible 95%
of malaria cases afghanistan cq first-line treatment given for
vivax malaria. pvmdr-1 pvcrt-o (k10 insertion) genes possible markers
for cq-resistance p. vivax isolates. studies done the
presence absence molecular markers cq-resistance p. vivax in
afghanistan. present work aimed evaluate frequency mutations the
pvmdr-1 k10 insertion pvcrt-o genes p. vivax.
methods: plasmodium vivax isolates collected laghman, baghlan khost
provinces. investigation polymorphisms desired regions pvmdr-1 and
pvcrt-o genes, sequencing applied pcr products. new asymmetric qpcr 
and melting analysis assay based unlabelled probe developed scanning of
k10 insertion pvcrt-o gene.
results: analysis sequencing data pvmdr-1 gene showed wild type
y976 k997 mutant m958 l1076 33 isolates three provinces. of
the 36 samples evaluated k10 insertion pvcrt-o, 2/18(11%), 0/10(0%) and
0/8(0%) isolates laghman, baghlan khost province, respectively,
possessed k10 insertion, confirmed either sequencing unlabelled probes.
conclusion: two samples k10 insertion 33 samples pvmdr1
polymorphism, indicating possibility cq resistance p. vivax
populations afghanistan. furthermore, unlabelled probes simple and
inexpensive alternative tools screening p. vivax mutations.
