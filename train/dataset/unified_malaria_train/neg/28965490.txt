background: interventions currently used 'infectious diseases
of poverty', remain highly debilitating deadly endemic
countries, especially malaria, schistosomiasis, echinococcosis african
sleeping sickness. however, major limitations current 'traditional' methods
for diagnosis neither simple convenient population surveillance, 
showed low sensitivity specificity. access novel technologies the
development adequate reliable tools expressly needed. collaborative 
project african network drugs diagnostics innovation partner 
institutions africa china aims screen suitable serological biomarkers
for diagnostic pipelines 'diseases poor'.
methods: parasite-specific exposed versus unexposed individuals screened and
sera urine/stools collected case-control studies china and
african countries. target genes/open reading frames selected, be
cloned cell-free expressed, quantified immuno-detected. target
antigens/epitopes probed screened sera exposed unexposed
individuals using high-throughput antigen screening platform study
progresses. specificity sensitivity highly immunoreactive biomarkers
will evaluated well, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays dipsticks.
discussion: roadmap explicitly unfolds integrated operating procedures
with focus malaria schistosomiasis, identification suitable
biomarkers aid prioritization diagnostics population use.
however, need validate new diagnostic comparison 
with standard methods field deployable tests region. expectations
for future seek regulatory approval promote use diagnostics
in endemic areas.
