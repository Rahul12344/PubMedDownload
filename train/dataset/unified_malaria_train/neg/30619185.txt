plasmodium infection pregnancy causes placental malfunction reducing fetus
sustainability leading abortions, stillbirths, low birth weight or
premature delivery. accumulation infected erythrocytes (ie) placenta is
a key factor placental malaria pathogenesis role played fetal
trophoblast contact maternal blood neglected. explore the
hypothesis interactions plasmodium-ie fetal trophoblast cells
impact vasoactive alterations underlying placental dysfunction. screened
gene expression key mediators vasoactive pathways. found mrna of
bradykinin receptor 2 (b2r) nitric oxide synthase (enos), well levels
of bradykinin (bk), decreased late gestation placentas pregnant
plasmodium berghei-infected mice. co-culturing mouse trophoblasts ie
down-regulated b2r transcription interleukin (il)-6 secretion a
b2r-signaling dependent manner. ie showed increased levels surface b2r and
enhanced capacity bind bk. propose down-regulation b2r signaling in
the course ie-trophoblast interactions due bk sequestration ie. in
corroboration, levels bk lower infected placentas positive
correlation b2r gene expression fetal weight disrupted infection.
this indicates deregulation bk-b2r pathway associated placental
dysfunction provoked malaria infection. found upon inhibition 
of b2r signaling, trophoblasts engulf ie lesser extent show reduced
