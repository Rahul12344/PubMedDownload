many important pathogens hiv/aids, influenza, malaria, dengue and
meningitis generally exist phenotypically distinct serotypes compete 
hosts. models used study diseases appear meta-population systems.
herein, revisit one multiple strain models used to
investigate dynamics infectious diseases co-circulating serotypes 
strains, provide analytical results underlying numerical investigations. 
in particular, establish necessary conditions local asymptotic
stability steady states existence oscillatory behaviors via
hopf bifurcation. addition, show existence discrete antigenic
forms among pathogens either fully partially self-organize, (i)
strains exhibit strain structures coexist (ii) antigenic variants sort 
into non-overlapping minimally overlapping clusters either undergo the
principle competitive exclusion exhibiting discrete strain structures, or
co-exist cyclically.
