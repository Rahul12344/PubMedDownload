evidence domestic transmission (autochthonous) reported. the
present study, isolate plasmodium vivax autochthonous clinical case
was subjected phylogenetic analysis genes encoding merozoite
surface protein 1 (msp-1) circumsporozoite protein (csp). msp
region, strain related strains brazil, south korea, turkey 
thailand, whereas csp region, strains brazil, colombia new
guinea. present study establishes first time greece basis
