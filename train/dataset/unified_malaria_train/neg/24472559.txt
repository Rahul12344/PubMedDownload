endo-parasites affect humans include plasmodium, causative agent of
malaria, remains one leading causes death human beings.
despite decades research, vaccines endo-parasites remain
elusive. part due hyper-variability parasites surface
proteins. generally surface proteins encoded large family of
genes, one dominantly expressed certain life stages. another
layer complexity introduced alternative splicing these
surface proteins. resulting isoforms may differ regard
to cell localisation, substrate affinities functions. may even differ in
structure extent longer recognised host's immune
system. many cases leads changes n terminus proteins. 
the geographical localisation endo-parasitic infections around tropics and
the highest incidences hiv-1 infection areas, adds layer
of complexity parasitic infections affect host immune system resulting 
higher hiv infection rates, faster disease progression, increase the
severity infections complications hiv diagnosis. review discusses 
some examples parasite surface proteins alternatively spliced in
trypanosomes, plasmodium parasitic worm schistosoma well role 
alternate splicing may play interaction hiv these
endo-parasites.
