mmv007564 novel antimalarial benzimidazolyl piperidine chemotype identified 
in cellular screens. identify genetic determinant mmv007564 resistance,
parasites cultured presence compound generate resistant
lines. whole genome sequencing revealed distinct mutations gene named
plasmodium falciparum cyclic amine resistance locus (pfcarl), encoding a
conserved protein unknown function. mutations pfcarl strongly
associated resistance structurally unrelated class compounds, the
imidazolopiperazines, including kaf156, currently clinical trials. data
demonstrate pfcarl mutations confer resistance two distinct compound
classes, benzimidazolyl piperidines imidazolopiperazines. however, mmv007564 
and imidazolopiperazines, kaf156 gnf179, different timings action
in asexual blood stage different potencies liver sexual
blood stages. data suggest pfcarl multidrug-resistance gene
rather common target benzimidazolyl piperidines and
imidazolopiperazines.
