three groups 10 different patients received 3 g, 6 g, 12 g l-arginine as
a half-hour infusion. remaining 43 received saline placebo. a

used explore optimal dosing regimens l-arginine. pk model describing
arginine concentrations patients moderately severe malaria extended
with two pharmacodynamic biomeasures, intermediary biochemical step (no
production) endothelial function (rh-pat index). linear model described the
relationship arginine concentrations exhaled no. concentrations
were linearly related rh-pat index. simulations dosing schedules using this
pkpd model predicted time within therapeutic range would increase with
increasing arginine dose. however, simulations demonstrated regimens of
continuous infusion longer periods would prolong time within the
therapeutic range even more. optimal dosing regimen l-arginine likely 
to administration schedule dependent. studies necessary to
characterize effects continuous infusions l-arginine and
