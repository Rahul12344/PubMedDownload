naturally acquired blood-stage infections malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum typically harbour multiple haploid clones. apparent number of
clones observed single infection depends diversity the
polymorphic markers used analysis, relative abundance rare
clones, frequently fail detected among pcr products derived from
numerically dominant clones. however, minority clones clinical interest as
they may harbour genes conferring drug resistance, leading enhanced survival
after treatment possibility subsequent therapeutic failure. we
deployed new generation sequencing derive genome data five non-propagated 
parasite isolates taken directly 4 different patients treated clinical
malaria uk hospital. analysis depth coverage length sequence
intervals paired reads identified previously described novel
gene deletions amplifications. full-length sequence data extracted 6 
loci considered selection antimalarial drugs, known and
previously unknown amino acid substitutions identified. full mitochondrial
genomes extracted sequencing data isolate, are
compared panel polymorphic sites derived published or
unpublished publicly available data. finally, genome-wide analysis clone
multiplicity performed, number infecting parasite clones estimated
for isolate. patient harboured least 3 clones p. falciparum by
this analysis, consistent results obtained conventional pcr analysis of
polymorphic merozoite antigen loci. conclude genome sequencing of
peripheral blood p. falciparum taken directly malaria patients provides high
quality data useful drug resistance studies, genomic structural analyses 
population genetics, also robustly represents clonal multiplicity.
