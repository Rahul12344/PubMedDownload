the cell wall-targeting echinocandin antifungals, although potent well
tolerated, inadequate treating fungal infections due narrow
spectrum activity propensity induce pathogen resistance. a
promising strategy overcome drawbacks combine echinocandins a
molecule improves activity also disrupts drug adaptation pathways.
in study, show puupehenone (puup), marine-sponge-derived
sesquiterpene quinone, potentiates echinocandin drug caspofungin (cas) in
cas-resistant fungal pathogens. conducted rna sequencing (rna-seq)
analysis, followed genetic molecular studies, elucidate puup's
cas-potentiating mechanism. found combination cas puup blocked
the induction cas-responding genes required adaptation cell wall
stress cell wall integrity (cwi) pathway. analysis showed
that puup inhibited activation slt2 (mpk1), terminal mitogen-activated
protein (map) kinase pathway. also found puup induced heat shock 
response genes inhibited activity heat shock protein 90 (hsp90).
molecular docking studies predicted puup occupies binding site hsp90
required interaction hsp90 cochaperone cdc37. thus, we
show puup potentiates cas activity previously undescribed mechanism
which involves disruption hsp90 activity cwi pathway. given the
requirement hsp90-cdc37 complex slt2 activation, suggest that
inhibitors complex would disrupt cwi pathway synergize with
echinocandins. therefore, identification puup's cas-potentiating mechanism
has important implications development new antifungal combination
therapies.importance fungal infections cause fatalities worldwide year 
than malaria tuberculosis. currently available antifungal drugs various
limitations, including host toxicity, narrow spectrum activity, pathogen
resistance. combining drugs small molecules overcome these
limitations useful strategy extending clinical use. have
investigated molecular mechanism marine-derived compound
potentiates activity antifungal echinocandin caspofungin. findings
revealed mechanism, different previously reported caspofungin
potentiators, potentiation achieved disruption hsp90
activity signaling cell wall integrity pathway, processes that
play important roles adaptation caspofungin fungal pathogens. given 
the importance stress adaptation development echinocandin
resistance, work serve starting point development new
combination therapies likely effective less prone to
pathogen resistance.
