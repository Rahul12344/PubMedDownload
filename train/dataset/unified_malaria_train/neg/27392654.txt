malaria humans caused six species plasmodium parasites, 
nuclear genome sequences two plasmodium ovale spp., p. ovale curtisi 
p. ovale wallikeri, plasmodium malariae yet analyzed. we
present analysis nuclear genome sequences three parasites, and
describe gene family expansions therein. plasmodium ovale curtisi p. ovale
wallikeri genetically distinct morphologically indistinguishable have
sympatric ranges tropics africa, asia oceania. p. ovale
spp. show expansion surfin variant gene family, amplification of
the plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) superfamily results an
approximately 30% increase genome size. comparison, also analyzed 
the draft nuclear genome p. malariae, malaria parasite causing mild malaria 
symptoms quartan life cycle, long-term chronic infections, wide
geographic distribution. plasmodium malariae shows moderate level of
expansion pir genes, unique expansions highly diverged transmembrane 
protein family 550 members gamete p25/27 gene family. the
observed diversity p. ovale wallikeri p. ovale curtisi surface
antigens, combined phylogenetic separation, supports consideration
that two parasites given species status.
