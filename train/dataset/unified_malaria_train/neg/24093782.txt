objective: investigate distribution patterns pfcrt pfmdr1
polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) isolates collected from
the malaria endemic area thailand along thai-myanmar border.
methods: dried blood spot samples collected 172 falciparum malaria
patients prior received treatment. samples extracted using chelex to
obtain parasite dna. pcr-rflp employed detect pfcrt mutation codons 76,
220, 271, 326, 356 371, pfmdr1 mutation codon 86. pfmdr1 gene copy
number determined sybr green real-time pcr.
results: mutant alleles pfcrt wild type allele pfmdr1 found in
almost samples. pfmdr1 gene copy number isolates collected areas 
ranged 1.0 5.0 copies proportion isolates carrying>1 gene copies
was 38.1%. distribution patterns pfcrt pfmdr1 mutations were
similar p. falciparum isolates areas. however, significant
differences number pfmdr1 copies prevalence isolates carrying>1
gene copies observed among isolates collected different areas. the
median pfmdr1 copy number p. falciparum collected kanchanaburi mae
hongson 2.5 2.0, respectively half isolates
carried>1 gene copies.
conclusions: observation pfmdr1 wild type increasing gene copy
number may suggest declining artesunate-mefloquine treatment efficacy p.
falciparum isolates border area.
