background: south asia, epidemiology malaria complex, and
transmission mainly occurs remote areas near international borders. vector
control implemented key strategy malaria prevention decades.
a rising threat efficacy vector control efforts development of
insecticide resistance, thus important monitor type frequency of
insecticide resistant alleles disease vectors an. sinensis along
the china-vietnam border. information needed synthesize effective
malaria vector control strategies.
methods: total 208 adults an. sinensis, collected seven sites in
southwest guangxi along china-vietnam border, inspected the
resistance-conferring g119s mutation acetylcholinesterase (ache) pcr-rflp
(polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism) kdr
mutations voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) sequencing. addition, 
the evolutionary origin an. sinensis vgsc gene haplotypes analyzed using
network 5.0.
results: frequencies mutant 119s ache 0.61-0.85 the
seven an. sinensis populations. susceptible homozygote (119gg) detected in
three seven sites (dxec, lzsk fcgdx). low frequencies kdr
(0.00-0.01) detected seven populations, individuals being
susceptible homozygote (1014ll). 1014f mutation detected the
southeast part (fcgdx) low frequency 0.03. 1014s mutation was
distributed six seven populations frequencies ranging 0.04 to
0.08, absent jxxw. diverse haplotypes 1014l 1014s found an.
sinensis along china-vietnam border, one 1014f haplotype was
detected study. consistent previous report, resistant 1014s
haplotypes single origin.
conclusions: g119s mutation ache present high frequencies
(0.61-0.85) an. sinensis populations along china-vietnam border,
suggesting vector control authorities cautious when
considering carbamates organophosphates chemicals vector control. 
low frequencies (0.00-0.11) kdr populations suggest pyrethroids 
remain suitable use an. sinensis regions.
