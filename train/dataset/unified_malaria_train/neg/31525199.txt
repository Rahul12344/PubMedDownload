dengue one serious mosquito-borne infectious diseases the
world. aedes albopictus invasive mosquito one primary
vectors dengue. vector control using insecticides viable strategy 
to prevent dengue virus transmission. guangzhou, 2014 pandemic,
massive insecticides implemented. massive insecticide use may lead to
the development resistance, reports available status of
insecticide resistance guangzhou 2014. study, ae. albopictus
were collected four districts varied dengue virus transmission
intensity guangzhou 2015 2017. adult ae. albopictus insecticide
susceptibility deltamethrin (0.03%), permethrin(0.25%), ddt(4%), malathion
(0.8%) bendiocarb (0.1%) determined standard tube test, and
larval resistance bioassays conducted using temephos, bacillus thuringiensis
israelensis (bti), pyriproxyfen (ppf) hexaflumuron. mutations the
voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene acetylcholinesterase (ache) gene
were analyzed. effect cytochrome p450s resistance ae. albopictus
to deltamethrin tested using synergistic agent piperonyl butoxide (pbo). 
the results showed ae. albopictus populations rapidly developed very
high resistances multiple commonly used insecticides study areas except
malathion, bti hexaflumuron. found 1534 codon mutations vgsc gene
that significantly correlated resistance pyrethroids ddt,
and 11 synonymous mutations also found gene. resistance to
deltamethrin significantly reduced pbo may generated
cross-resistance ppf. fast emerging resistance ae. albopictus may affect
mosquito management threaten prevention control dengue, similar to
the resistance anopheles mosquitoes prevented elimination malaria
and call timely guided insecticide management.
