recent advances scale diversity population genomic datasets for
bacteria provide potential genome-wide patterns co-evolution be
studied resolution individual bases. describe new statistical
method, genomedca, uses recent advances computational structural biology
to identify polymorphic loci strongest co-evolutionary pressures.
we apply genomedca two large population data sets representing major human
pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) streptococcus pyogenes
(group streptococcus). pneumococcus identified 5,199 putative epistatic 
interactions 1,936 sites. three-quarters links between
sites within pbp2x, pbp1a pbp2b genes, sequences are
critical determining non-susceptibility beta-lactam antibiotics. a
network-based analysis found genes also coupled encoding
dihydrofolate reductase, changes underlie trimethoprim resistance.
distinct antibiotic resistance genes, large network component 384
protein coding sequences encompassed many genes critical basic cellular
functions, another distinct component included genes associated with
virulence. group streptococcus (gas) data set population represents a
clonal population relatively little genetic variation high level of
linkage disequilibrium across genome. despite this, able pinpoint 
two rna pseudouridine synthases, strongly linked separate
set loci across chromosome, representing biologically plausible targets of
co-selection. population genomic analysis method applied identifies
statistically significantly co-evolving locus pairs, potentially arising from
fitness selection interdependence reflecting underlying protein-protein
interactions, genes whose product activities contribute phenotype.
this discovery approach greatly enhances future potential epistasis
analysis systems biology, complement genome-wide association studies 
as means formulating hypotheses targeted experimental work.
