the macaque parasite plasmodium knowlesi significant concern malaysia
where cases human infection increasing. parasites infecting humans
originate genetically distinct subpopulations associated the
long-tailed (macaca fascicularis (mf)) pig-tailed macaques (macaca nemestrina 
(mn)). used new high-quality reference genome re-evaluate previously
described subpopulations among human macaque isolates malaysian-borneo
and peninsular-malaysia. nuclear genomes dimorphic, expected, new
evidence chromosomal-segment exchanges subpopulations found. a
large segment chromosome 8 originating mn subpopulation and
containing genes encoding proteins expressed mosquito-borne parasite stages,
was found mf genotypes. contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes
partitioned 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked nuclear genomic
dimorphism. subpopulations diverged isolation re-connected,
possibly due deforestation disruption wild macaque habitats. the
resulting genomic mosaics reveal traits selected host-vector-parasite
interactions setting ecological transition.
