BACKGROUND: Symptoms of primary HIV infection, including fever, rash, and
headache, are nonspecific and are often described as flu-like. COVID-19
vaccination side effects, such as fever, which occur in up to 10% of people
following COVID-19 vaccination, can make the diagnosis of acute HIV infection
even more challenging.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old man presented with fever and headache following 
COVID-19 vaccination. The symptoms were initially thought to be vaccine side
effects. A diagnostic workup was conducted due to persisting fever and headache
> 72 h following vaccination, and he was diagnosed with Fiebig stage II acute HIV
infection, 3 weeks after having unprotected anal intercourse with another man.
CONCLUSION: Thorough anamnesis is key to estimating the individual risk of
primary HIV infection, in patients presenting with flu-like symptoms. Early
diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy is associated with better
prognosis and limits transmission of the disease.
