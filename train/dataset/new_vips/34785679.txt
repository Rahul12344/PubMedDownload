COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness, but several clinical
reports have described gastrointestinal symptoms. This is particularly true in
children in whom gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent and viral shedding
outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. These observations raise
the question of whether the virus can replicate within the stomach. Here we
generate gastric organoids from fetal, pediatric, and adult biopsies as in vitro 
models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To facilitate infection, we induce reverse
polarity in the gastric organoids. We find that the pediatric and late fetal
gastric organoids are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, while viral
replication is significantly lower in undifferentiated organoids of early fetal
and adult origin. We demonstrate that adult gastric organoids are more
susceptible to infection following differentiation. We perform transcriptomic
analysis to reveal a moderate innate antiviral response and a lack of
differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, 
we show that the virus can efficiently infect the gastric epithelium, suggesting 
that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
