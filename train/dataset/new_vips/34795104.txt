Almost half of the world population has received at least one dose of vaccine
against the COVID-19 virus. However, vaccine hesitancy amongst certain
populations is driving new waves of infections at alarming rates. The popularity 
of online social media platforms attracts supporters of the anti-vaccination
movement who spread misinformation about vaccine safety and effectiveness. We
conducted a semantic network analysis to explore and analyze COVID-19 vaccine
misinformation on the Reddit social media platform.
