INTRODUCTION: BK polyomavirus (BKV) is a common infection among kidney transplant
recipients (KTR). Risk factors and outcomes based on donor characteristics remain
largely unknown.
METHODS: In this study, we aimed to analyze the impact of donor factors through a
paired kidney analysis. We included 289 pairs of adult deceased donor transplants
(578 KTRs total); each pair had received kidneys from the same donor. Recipient
pairs were divided into three groups: "no BK group" if neither KTR developed BK
viremia (n = 336), "discordant" if the only one did (n = 176), and "concordant"
if both did (n = 66). Acute rejection (AR), graft failure, and BK nephropathy
(BKN) were outcomes of interest.
RESULTS: Donors in the concordant group were younger, had lower KDPI, and were
less likely to be DCD. In multivariate analyses, KTRs who had a donor with a
higher BMI (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; p = .009) were less likely to develop
BKV. Concordance was not associated with AR (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.51-1.34; p =
.45), graft failure (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.42-7.50; p = .43) or BKN (HR: 1.02; 95% 
CI: 0.51-2.03; p = .96).
DISCUSSION: Our study suggests lower donor BMI is associated with BKV infection, 
and concordance or discordance between paired kidney recipients is not associated
with poor outcomes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
