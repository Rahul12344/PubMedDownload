High-throughput sequencing from symptomatic tomato and pepper plants collected in
Panama rendered the complete genome of the southern tomato virus (isolate
STV_Panama) and bell pepper endornavirus (isolate BPEV_Panama), and
almost-complete genomes of three other BPEV isolates. Tomato chlorosis virus,
tomato mosaic virus, and impatiens necrotic spot virus were also detected.
Analysis of the complete genome of STV and BPEV worldwide isolates revealed
nucleotide diversities of 0.004246 and 0.070523, respectively. Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis showed two main groups for each virus (I and II), and
several subgroups for BPEV (IA, IB, IC, IIA and IIB). Isolate STV_Panama
clustered with NC_12-03-08 from USA and Tom3-T from France (99.97% nucleotide
identity) in Group I and BPEV_Panama was close to the Canadian isolate
BPEV_Ontario (99.66% nucleotide identity) in Subgroup IB. No correlation was
observed between geographic and genetic distances for both viruses. Panamanian
BPEV isolates were divergent, belonging to Groups I and II (nucleotide identities
> 87.33%). Evolutionary analysis showed purifying selection in all encoding
regions of both viruses, being stronger in the overlapping region of both STV
genes. Finally, recombination was detected in BPEV but not in STV. This is the
first report of STV and BPEV in Panama.
