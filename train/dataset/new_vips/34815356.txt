BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) benefit patients with multiple
cancer types, however, additional predictive biomarkers of response are needed.
CD274 (programmed cell death ligand-1, PD-L1) gene rearrangements are positively 
associated with PD-L1 expression and may confer benefit to ICI, thus a pan-cancer
characterization of these alterations is needed.
METHODS: We analyzed 283,050 patient samples across multiple tumor types that
underwent comprehensive genomic profiling for activating CD274 rearrangements and
other alterations. The DAKO 22C3 Tumor Proportion Scoring (TPS) method was used
for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing in a small subset with available
data (n=55,423). A retrospective deidentified real-world clinico-genomic database
(CGDB) was examined for ICI treatment outcomes. We also report a detailed case of
CD274-rearranged metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.
RESULTS: We identified 145 samples with functional rearrangements in CD274. There
were significant enrichments for PIK3CA, JAK2, PDCD1LG2, CREBBP, and PBRM1
co-mutations (ORs=2.1, 16.7, 17.8, 3.6, and 3.4, respectively, p<0.01). Genomic
human papillomavirus (HPV)-16, Epstein-Barr virus, and mismatch repair genes also
co-occurred (OR=6.2, 8.4, and 4.3, respectively, p<0.05). Median tumor mutational
burden (TMB) was higher compared with CD274 wild-type samples (7.0 vs 3.5
mutations/Mb, p=1.7e-11), with disease-specific TMB enrichment in non-small cell 
lung, colorectal, unknown primary, and stomach cancers. PD-L1 IHC skewed toward
positivity (N=39/43 samples with ≥1% positivity). Of eight patients from the
CGDB, three remained on ICI treatment after 6 months. Separately, one patient
with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma experienced a pathologic complete response 
on chemoimmunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: CD274 gene rearrangements are associated with increased PD-L1 IHC
scores, higher TMB, and potential clinical benefit in ICI-treated patients with
cancer.
