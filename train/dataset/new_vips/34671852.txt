Bocaviruses are typical zoonotic pathogens with a wide range of hosts. Here, we
report the detection of human bocavirus (HBoV) in Rattus norvegicus captured in
China and the results of sequencing and phylogenetic analysis based on the
partial VP1 region and the entire viral genome. A total of 357 fecal samples from
rats were collected in 2015-2017 and analyzed for HBoV using PCR. The detection
rate of HBoV was 0.84% (3/357). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus is
genetically closely related to HBoV-2. R. norvegicus may be a carrier of HBoV,
and its impact on public health merits attention.
