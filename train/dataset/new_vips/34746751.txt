The goal of this paper is to discuss the role religions are playing to stem the
tide against the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Ghana. Focusing on the
ubiquity of religions in Ghana, the paper argues that religious experts deploy
their ability to invoke the transcendental being to compel adherents to comply
with the lockdown rules, as well as follow precautionary measures to fight the
virus in Ghana. The paper also maintains that the state has, in the face of the
current crisis, passed a law that could be inimical to the future of religious
freedom in the country. Methodologically, I draw on critical reflections on
electronic and social media reports about religion and humanitarian services in
Ghana to argue that religions are bridging the mundane and spiritual gaps to aid 
the state, while the state is also creatively engaging religions to invest in
prayers and also pass laws that are potentially inimical to the future of
religious freedom.
