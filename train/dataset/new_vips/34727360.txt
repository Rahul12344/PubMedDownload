Medically important arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV),
and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are primarily transmitted by the globally
distributed mosquito Aedes aegypti. Increasing evidence suggests that the
transmission of some viruses can be influenced by mosquito-specific and
mosquito-borne viruses. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and
bioinformatics have expanded our knowledge on the richness of viruses harbored by
mosquitoes. HTS was used to characterize the presence of virus sequences in
wild-caught adult Ae. aegypti from Tocantins (TO) state, Brazil. Samples of
mosquitoes were collected in four cities of Tocantins state and submitted to RNA 
isolation, followed by sequencing at an Illumina HiSeq platform. Our results
showed initially by Krona the presence of 3% of the sequenced reads belonging to 
the viral database. After further analysis, the virus sequences were found to
have homology to two viral families found in insects Phenuiviridae and
Metaviridae. Three possible viral strains including putative new viruses were
detected and named Phasi Charoen-like phasivirus isolate To-1 (PCLV To-1), Aedes 
aegypti To virus 1 (AAToV1), and Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (AAToV2). The results
presented in this work contribute to the growing knowledge about the diversity of
viruses in mosquitoes and might be useful for future studies on the interaction
between insect-specific viruses and arboviruses.
