BACKGROUND: Previous works have observed that younger infants with chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are more responsive to antiviral treatment.
However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the dynamic
changes of HBV quasispecies in infants with immunoprophylaxis failure were
investigated to provide virological explanations for clinical management on
infantile antiviral therapy.
METHODS: Thirteen 7-month-old infants with immunoprophylaxis failure and their
mothers were enrolled from a prospective cohort, and 8 of them were followed up
to 3 years old. The sequences of HBV quasispecies were analyzed by the
full-length genome clone-based sequencing, and compared among mothers and their
infants at different ages.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the complexity, mutation frequency and genetic
distance of HBV quasispecies decreased significantly at full-length, partial open
reading frames and regulatory regions of HBV genome at nucleotide level in
7-month-old infants comparing with their mothers, whereas increased significantly
to near the maternal level when infants grew up to 3 years old. Furthermore,
similar changes were also found in Core, PreS2, RT and P regions of HBV genome at
amino acid level, especially for potential NAs-resistant mutants in RT region and
immune-escape mutants in Core and PreS2 regions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered the evolution of HBV quasispecies in infancy
after mother-to-child transmission, which may provide the virological evidence
for explaning that younger children are more responsive to antiviral therapy.
