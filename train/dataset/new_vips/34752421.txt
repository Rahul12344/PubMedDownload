The increasing frequency of pathogenic coronaviruses in the human population has 
raised public health concerns about possible future pandemics. It is critical to 
understand whether immune responses to the current circulating coronaviruses
provide protection against related viruses or those that may emerge in the
future. In this issue of the JCI, Dangi, Palacio, et al. detail the extent of
coronavirus cross-protection following both vaccination and natural infection and
ultimately use murine models to highlight the mechanism behind this heterotypic
immunity. This study provides insight into the possibility of a pan-coronavirus
vaccine that could protect humans against future coronavirus outbreaks.
