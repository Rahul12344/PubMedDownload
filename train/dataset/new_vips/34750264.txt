COVID-19 has had worse health, education, and labor market effects on groups with
low socioeconomic status (SES) than on those with high SES. Little is known,
however, about whether COVID-19 has also had differential effects on noncognitive
skills that are important for life outcomes. Using panel data from before and
during the pandemic, we show that COVID-19 affects one key noncognitive skill,
that is, prosociality. While prosociality is already lower for low-SES students
prior to the pandemic, we show that COVID-19 infections within families amplify
the prosociality gap between French high school students of high and low SES by
almost tripling its size in comparison to pre-COVID-19 levels.
