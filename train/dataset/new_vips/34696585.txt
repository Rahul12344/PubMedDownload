The early diagnosis of diseases plays a vital role in healthcare and the
extension of human life. Graphene-based biosensors have boosted the early
diagnosis of diseases by detecting and monitoring related biomarkers, providing a
better understanding of various physiological and pathological processes. They
have generated tremendous interest, made significant advances, and offered
promising application prospects. In this paper, we discuss the background of
graphene and biosensors, including the properties and functionalization of
graphene and biosensors. Second, the significant technologies adopted by
biosensors are discussed, such as field-effect transistors and electrochemical
and optical methods. Subsequently, we highlight biosensors for detecting various 
biomarkers, including ions, small molecules, macromolecules, viruses, bacteria,
and living human cells. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of
graphene-based biosensors and related broad research interests are discussed.
