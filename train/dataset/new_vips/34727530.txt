Wearing a face mask has become a necessity following the outbreak of the
coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, where its effectiveness in containing the
pandemic has been confirmed. Nevertheless, the pandemic has revealed major
deficiencies in the ability to manufacture and ramp up worldwide production of
efficient surgical-grade face masks. As a result, many researchers have focused
their efforts on the development of low cost, smart and effective face covers. In
this article, following a short introduction concerning face mask requirements,
the different nanotechnology-enabled techniques for achieving better protection
against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are reviewed, including the development of
nanoporous and nanofibrous membranes in addition to triboelectric nanogenerators 
based masks, which can filter the virus using various mechanisms such as
straining, electrostatic attraction and electrocution. The development of
nanomaterials-based mask coatings to achieve virus repellent and sterilizing
capabilities, including antiviral, hydrophobic and photothermal features are also
discussed. Finally, the usability of nanotechnology-enabled face masks is
discussed and compared with that of current commercial-grade N95 masks. To
conclude, we highlight the challenges associated with the quick transfer of
nanomaterials-enabled face masks and provide an overall outlook of the importance
of nanotechnology in counteracting the COVID-19 and future pandemics.
