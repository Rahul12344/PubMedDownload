Lessons Learned from COVID-19: The Youth Sports World Going Forward.

Subramanyam V, Kinderknecht J.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic profoundly impacted athletes and
organizations of all ages and calibers. As optimism grows and restrictions lift, 
the mindset of youth sports shifts to prospection. Using the lessons learned
during the cancelled, postponed, or modified 2020-2021 season, stakeholders
should envision a different playing field moving forward. The void of youth
sports highlighted the many values it brings to athletes physically, mentally,
and socially. The regionality of sport during the pandemic highlighted resource
and funding disparities among communities. Consideration must be given to the
overall health of the student-athlete and how to return to competition and
spectatorship safely and responsibly. The pandemic required youth sport to
collaborate with public health with the hope of creating a semblance of normalcy 
in upcoming seasons. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(11):e470-e473.].
