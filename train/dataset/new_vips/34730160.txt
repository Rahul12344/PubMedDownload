This communication describes a novel water-soluble membrane prepared from
chitosan intended for SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid collection and detection. The
CSH membrane formed from nanofibers shows promising potential in the quantitative
determination of the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acids at a concentration of 102
copies per L in air. The sponge-like structure which allows gas to pass through
for collection of viral nucleic acids potentially provides simple, fast, and
reliable sampling as well as detection of various types of airborne viruses.
