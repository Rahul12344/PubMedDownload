Lentiviral vectors (LVs), derived from human immunodeficiency virus, are powerful
tools for modifying the genes of eukaryotic cells such as hematopoietic stem
cells and neural cells. With the extensive and in-depth studies on this gene
therapy vehicle over the past two decades, LVs have been widely used in both
research and clinical trials. For instance, third-generation and self-inactive
LVs have been used to introduce a gene with therapeutic potential into the host
genome and achieve targeted delivery into specific tissue. When LVs are employed 
in leukemia, the transduced T cells recognize and kill the tumor B cells; in
β-thalassemia, the transduced CD34+ cells express normal β-globin; in adenosine
deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency, the autologous CD34+ cells 
express adenosine deaminase and realize immune reconstitution. Overall, LVs can
perform significant roles in the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases, 
hemoglobinopathies, B cell leukemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this
review, we discuss the recent developments and therapeutic applications of LVs.
The safe and efficient LVs show great promise as a tool for human gene therapy.
