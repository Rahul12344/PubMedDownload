Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019 and the
pandemic continues for more than one year, a vast amount of drug research has
been conducted and few of them got FDA approval. Our objective is to prioritize
repurposable drugs using a pipeline that systematically integrates the
interaction between COVID-19 and drugs, deep graph neural networks, and in
vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all available drugs
(n = 3635) related to COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a
COVID-19 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes,
pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to
derive the candidate drug's representation based on the biological interactions. 
We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then
validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and
population-based treatment effect. We highlight the top 22 drugs including
Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further
pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. In
summary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deep
neural networks, and multiple evidence can facilitate the rapid identification of
candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
