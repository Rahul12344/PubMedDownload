The aim of this study was to analyze university Health Sciences students'
self-perception regarding gender stereotypes, and to explore whether there was
any association between gender stereotypes and clinical/socio-demographic
variables.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 252 
university students who completed a self-administrated online questionnaire
(18.3% males, 81.7% females). We evaluated the self-perception of gender
stereotypes as determined using the BSRI-12 questionnaire and explored the
association of this measure with the impact of perceived stress measured using a 
modified scale (PSS-10-C) as well as anxiety and depression according to scores
on the Goldberg scale (GADS).
RESULTS: According to the students' self-perception of gender stereotypes, 24.9% 
self-perceived themselves as feminine, 20.1% as masculine, 24.9% as androgynous, 
and 30% as undifferentiated. The degree determines self-identification with
gender stereotypes. Nursing and Occupational Therapy are studied mostly by women,
28.4% and 45%, respectively, while Physiotherapy is studied mainly by men
(71.2%). Females indicated more anxiety (75.7%) and depression (81.7%) than males
(52.9% and 67.3%, respectively). In contrast, males developed more stress (88.5%)
than females (74.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: University degree, anxiety, depression, and stress determined
self-identification with gender stereotypes. The results of this study indicate
that gender roles influence the possibility of developing mental disorders and
should be taken into account in future studies.
