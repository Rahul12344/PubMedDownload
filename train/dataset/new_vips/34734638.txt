Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is 
an emerging public health concern in the state of Michigan. Although Michigan has
one of the highest incidence rates of EEE in the United States, much of the
information known about cases in humans, equines, and other animals residing in
Michigan is unpublished. This article summarizes such information and explores
spatial trends in the historic distribution of EEE in Michigan. Outbreaks in
Michigan have occurred over an 80-yr interval, involving only horses in 1942-1943
and 1973-1976, and then episodically from 1980 to 2020, and involving horses,
humans, and wild and domestic animals. An estimated 1,036 equine cases (confirmed
and suspected) and 36 confirmed human cases have occurred, including 10 in 2019
(6 deaths) and 4 in 2020 (2 deaths). Human cases ranged in age from 1 to 81 yr;
70% were male, and fatality rate of 34.3%. Equine and human cases occurred from
July to October, peaked in August, and cluster in space in southwestern and
southeastern lower Michigan. Cases occurred in glacial outwash and ice-contact
landscapes in glacial interlobate zones. EEE virus (EEEV) was recovered from
Culiseta melanura, Coquillettidia perturbans, five species of Aedes, and other
mosquito species near horse and human case sites. Virus isolations or presence of
neutralizing antibodies in several passerine species of birds suggest broad
EEEV-bird associations. White-tailed deer and other wildlife were also affected. 
Geographic spread to northern areas of the state suggests expansion of this
disease system into new and unsuspected foci.
