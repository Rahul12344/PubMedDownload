Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is closely associated to liver injury with
diverse clinical features in adolescents and adults. It is often manifested as
infectious mononucleosis syndrome, sometimes causing self-limited acute
hepatitis, with mild to moderate elevation of liver transaminases, and relative
increase in age-related conditions. EBV infection can also cause cholestatic
hepatitis, with elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase as the
main manifestations, accompanied by varying degrees of jaundice. A small number
of patients with severe EBV infection may experience liver failure, and if left
untreated in time, it may lead to high mortality. In addition, EBV infection is
also associated with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, autoimmune liver
disease, etc.

EB病毒（EBV）感染与青少年和成人肝损伤密切相关，临床特征多样。常表现为传染性单核细胞增多症时的急性自限性肝炎，特点是以转氨酶轻、中度升高为主，随年龄增加病情相
对加重。EBV感染还可致淤胆型肝炎，以碱性磷酸酶和γ-谷氨酰转移酶升高为主要表现，伴不同程度黄疸。少数EBV感染严重者可出现肝衰竭，如果不能及时治疗，病死率较高。
此外，EBV感染与慢性肝炎、肝硬化、自身免疫性肝病等有一定关联。.
