PURPOSE: Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a modified herpes simplex virus
type-1 used as intralesional immunotherapy in stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma patients.
Recently, Stahlie et al. published a predictive model for complete response (CR) 
to T-VEC. This study was designed to validate this model externally in an
independent, American patient cohort.
METHODS: In total, 71 stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma patients treated with T-VEC at
Moffitt Cancer Center were included. A second nomogram was built incorporating
the same predictive factors: tumor size (diameter of largest metastasis), type of
metastases (cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal), and number of metastases (cutoff:
< 20 and > 20). Predictive accuracy was assessed through calculation of overall
performance, discriminative ability, and calibration.
RESULTS: The two cohorts were similar in many clinicopathologic factors and only 
differing in tumor mutational status and use of systemic therapy prior to T-VEC. 
In the validation cohort, 37 (52%) patients showed CR, 22 (31%) partial response 
(PR), 2 (5.6%) stable disease (SD), and 10 (15%) progressive disease (PD). Of
those who demonstrated a CR, 16 (43%) recurred. Overall performance was good
(0.164), and discriminative power resulted in fair discriminative ability
(0.827). The calibration curve showed slight underestimation for predicted
probabilities > 0.15 and slight overestimation <0.15.
CONCLUSIONS: The original model as well as the validation model show comparable
and good predictive accuracy. The validation model reinforces the conclusion that
for the best response to T-VEC, it should be used early on in the course of the
disease, when the tumor burden is cutaneous with smaller diameter and fewer of
metastases.
