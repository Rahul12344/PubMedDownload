A number of framework amides with a ginsenol backbone have been synthesized using
the Ritter reaction. We named the acetamide as Ginsamide. A method was developed 
for the synthesis of the corresponding amine and thioacetamide. The new compounds
revealed a high activity against H1N1 influenza, which was confirmed using an
animal model. Biological experiments were performed to determine the mechanism of
action of the new agents, a ginsamide-resistant strain of influenza virus was
obtained, and the pathogenicity of the resistant strain and the control strain
was studied. It was shown that the emergence of resistance to Ginsamide was
accompanied by a reduction in the pathogenicity of the influenza virus.
