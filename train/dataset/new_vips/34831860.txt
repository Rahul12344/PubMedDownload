The prevalence of allergic diseases is regarded as one of the key challenges in
health worldwide. Although the precise mechanisms underlying this rapid increase 
in prevalence are unknown, emerging evidence suggests that genetic and
environmental factors play a significant role. The immune system, microbiota,
viruses, and bacteria have all been linked to the onset of allergy disorders in
recent years. Avoiding allergen exposure is the best treatment option; however,
steroids, antihistamines, and other symptom-relieving drugs are also used.
Allergen bioinformatics encompasses both computational tools/methods and
allergen-related data resources for managing, archiving, and analyzing
allergological data. This study highlights allergy-promoting mechanisms,
algorithms, and concepts in allergen bioinformatics, as well as major areas for
future research in the field of allergology.
