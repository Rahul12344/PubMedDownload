BACKGROUND: Studies of outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 are uncommon.
We studied: 1) association of symptoms with reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results; and 2) association of initial RT-PCR cycle 
threshold (Ct) in relation to duration of RT-PCR positivity in outpatients with
mild or moderate COVID-19.
METHODS: This was a cohort study of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and at
least one symptom. Participants had repeat nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom
checklists every 3-5 days until two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative.
RT-PCR tests were used to assess viral load. Antibody tests for COVID-19 were
performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after symptom onset.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (nine females) were enrolled, ranging in age from
19-58 (median age 28 years). All patients reported at least one symptom, with a
median of six symptoms per patient. Symptoms persisted for 6-67 days (median
duration 18 days). In all 25 patients, blood samples collected a median of 13
days after symptom onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15 (60%).
After a median of 28 days following symptom onset, 23/23 patients with available 
samples tested positive for antibodies. The longest duration of positive RT-PCR
test was 49 days from first positive PCR test (Mean = 27.4, SD = 12.5, Median =
24). Initial Ct was significantly associated with longer duration (Î² = -1.3, SE =
0.3, p<0.01 per 1 cycle higher) of RT-PCR positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 outpatients, RT-PCT tests
remained positive for as long as 49 days and test positivity and symptom duration
correlated with initial viral load.
