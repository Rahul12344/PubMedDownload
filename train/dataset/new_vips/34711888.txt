We quantified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air of different hospital
settings and the autopsy room of the largest medical centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to determine the presence of the
envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the nucleocapsid protein genes. The E-gene was
detected in 5 out of 6 samples at the ICU-COVID-19 ward and in 5 out of 7 samples
at the ward-COVID-19. Similarly, in the non-dedicated facilities, the E-gene was 
detected in 5 out of 6 samples collected in the ICU and 4 out of 7 samples in the
ward. In the necropsy room, 6 out of 7 samples were positive for the E-gene. When
both wards were compared, the non-COVID ward presented a significantly higher
concentration of the E-gene than in the COVID-19 ward (p = 0.003). There was no
significant difference in E-gene concentration between the ICU-COVID-19 and the
ICU (p = 0.548). Likewise, there was no significant difference among E-gene
concentrations found in the autopsy room versus the ICUs and wards (dedicated or 
not) (p = 0.245). Our results show the widespread presence of aerosol
contamination in different hospital units.
