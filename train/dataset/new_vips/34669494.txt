OBJECTIVE: To describe the in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) features of the
corneal epithelium and stroma in dogs and cats with herpetic dendritic ulcerative
keratitis.
ANIMALS: 6 client-owned dogs and 10 client-owned cats with herpetic dendritic
ulcerative keratitis (affected group) and 10 dogs and 10 cats from
specific-pathogen-free laboratory colonies (nonaffected group).
PROCEDURES: After complete ophthalmic examination, IVCM corneal examination was
performed on the clinically diseased eyes of animals in the affected group and on
both eyes of animals in the nonaffected group. Results by species were compared
between groups.
RESULTS: In the affected group, all 6 dogs had unilateral ocular lesions (total, 
6 eyes examined), whereas 7 cats had unilateral lesions and 3 cats had bilateral 
lesions (total, 13 eyes examined). For the nonaffected group, 20 cat eyes and 20 
dog eyes were examined. Corneal epithelial morphological abnormalities were
identified in all examined eyes of animals in the affected group and in no
examined eyes of the nonaffected group. Hyperreflective punctate opacities and
inflammatory cells were present in all epithelial layers in examined eyes of
affected animals but were absent in nonaffected animals. Similarly, Langerhans
cells and anterior stromal dendritic cells were identified in corneas of eyes
examined for animals in the affected group but not in any eye of animals in the
nonaffected group. Stromal changes were less consistent in the affected group,
but absent in the nonaffected group.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that herpetic dendritic
ulcerative keratitis in dogs and cats is associated with microanatomic corneal
abnormalities that can be detected by IVCM.
