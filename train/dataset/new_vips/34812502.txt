BACKGROUND: After hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination, patients should be
followed up due to risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Growth differentiation
factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine induced by mitochondrial dysfunction or oxidative
stress. Aim To evaluate the prognostic value of GDF15 for HCC occurrence after
HCV elimination.
METHODS: We measured GDF15 levels in stored serum from patients with chronic HCV 
infection without a history of HCC who had achieved sustained virological
response with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). The patients were randomly
divided into derivation (n = 964) and validation (n = 642) cohorts.
RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, serum GDF15 levels were higher in those with
HCC occurrence after DAA treatment than in those without. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards analysis revealed baseline GDF15 (>1350 pg/mL, HR 2.54), AFP
(>5 ng/mL, HR 2.00), and the FIB-4 index (>3.25, HR 2.69) to be independent risk 
factors for HCC. Scoring based on GDF15, AFP and the FIB-4 index stratified HCC
occurrence risk. In the validation cohort, the cumulative HCC occurrence rate at 
3 years was 0.64%, 3.27% and 15.3% in low-score (N = 171), medium-score (N = 300)
and high-score (N = 166) groups, respectively. In the total cohort, scoring
divided patients with a FIB-4 index ≤3.25, whose HCC occurrence rate was 2.0% at 
3 years, into medium-score and low-score groups with HCC occurrence rates at
3 years of 3.76% and 0.24%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum GDF15 predicts de novo HCC occurrence. Scoring using GDF15,
AFP, and the FIB-4 index can predict de novo HCC occurrence risk after HCV
elimination.
