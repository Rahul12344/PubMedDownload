OBJECTIVES: We aimed to comprehensively explore the etiology of granulomatous
lobular mastitis (GLM) to optimize treatment programs.
METHODS: We collected 30 fresh mastitis samples for metagenomic next-generation
sequencing, morphological observation, and analysis of the clinical information.
RESULTS: Of the 30 samples, 25 were GLM; pathogens were detected in 17, these
were: Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (10 of 25, 40%); C. kroppenstedtii and
Pseudomonas oleovorans (3 of 25, 12%); C. kroppenstedtii and human
gammaherpesvirus 4 (1 of 25, 4%); Acinetobacter baumannii and C. kroppenstedtii
(1 of 25, 4%); P. oleovorans (1 of 25, 4%); and Tepidiphilus thermophilus (1 of
25, 4%). Abnormal sex hormone levels (mainly prolactin) and/or autoimmune
function were found in 12 of the 25 samples. Lipophilic antibiotics (rifampicin) 
were found to work effectively in patients with slow-healing wounds after
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The main pathogenic factor of GLM is C. kroppenstedtii infection,
but other unusual pathogens (P. oleovorans, human gammaherpesvirus 4, A.
baumannii, T. thermophilus) are likely to be closely related to GLM, particularly
human gammaherpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus)-associated mastitis, which may be a
new entity of mastitis. Abnormal levels of sex hormones and autoimmune function
are also common causes. Therefore, lipophilic antibiotics (rifampicin) and
prolactin inhibitors may be an effective treatment.
