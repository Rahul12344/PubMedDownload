The NHS Five Year Forward View focuses on expansion and development of community 
services and out-of-hospital care. Hospital at Home is a concept that provides
acute active treatment that would traditionally be provided in an inpatient
setting, involving nursing staff and therapists. As well as being financially
favourable, it is important to acknowledge that often, for a multitude of
reasons, people prefer to remain at home rather than be admitted to hospital for 
treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has further reiterated that patients are at risk
of nosocomial infection. More importantly Hospital at Home care has consistently 
been associated with greater satisfaction compared to acute hospital care for
both patients and their family members.
