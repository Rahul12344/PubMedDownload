Varying differentiation of myeloid cells is common in tumors, inflammation,
autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases. The release of cytokines from
myeloid cells is an important driving factor that leads to severe COVID-19 cases 
and subsequent death. This review briefly summarizes the results of single-cell
sequencing of peripheral blood, lung tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 
patients and describes the differentiation trajectory of myeloid cells in
patients. Moreover, we describe the function and mechanism of abnormal
differentiation of myeloid cells to promote disease progression. Targeting
myeloid cell-derived cytokines or checkpoints is essential in developing a
combined therapeutic strategy for patients with severe COVID-19.
