Group-I Fowl adenovirus (FAdV) is still widespread in China's chicken farms,
leading to huge economic losses. The traditional PCR method, which can detect all
serotypes at the same time, is not sensitive enough to obtain accurate results,
especially in some samples containing only a low titer of virus, such as
contaminated live vaccine. In order to solve this problem, this study developed a
dot blot assay based on the above PCR method. A total of 6 probes targeting the
conserved region of FAdV were designed and systematically optimized through
sensitivity, accuracy, and stability analyses. Results showed that it is not only
suitable for 12 serotypes, but also effectively improve the sensitivity, which
increased more than 100 times in comparison with PCR assay. Moreover, this
sensitivity was increased 100 times when detecting contaminated live vaccine
samples, showing the great prospect of this method in daily monitoring.
