Chronic viral infections subvert protective B cell immunity. An early type I
interferon (IFN-I)-driven bias to short-lived plasmablast differentiation leads
to clonal deletion, so-called "decimation," of antiviral memory B cells.
Therefore, prophylactic countermeasures against decimation remain an unmet need. 
We show that vaccination-induced CD4 T cells prevented the decimation of naïve
and memory B cells in chronically lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV)-infected mice. Although these B cell responses were largely T independent 
when IFN-I was blocked, preexisting T help assured their sustainability under
conditions of IFN-I-driven inflammation by instructing a germinal center B cell
transcriptional program. Prevention of decimation depended on T cell-intrinsic
Bcl6 and Tfh progeny formation. Antigen presentation by B cells, interactions
with antigen-specific T helper cells, and costimulation by CD40 and ICOS were
also required. Importantly, B cell-mediated virus control averted Th1-driven
immunopathology in LCMV-challenged animals with preexisting CD4 T cell immunity. 
Our findings show that vaccination-induced Tfh cells represent a cornerstone of
effective B cell immunity to chronic virus challenge, pointing the way toward
more effective B cell-based vaccination against persistent viral diseases.
