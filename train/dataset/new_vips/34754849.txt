BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has markedly
influenced the endoscopic patterns. Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an essential technique for pancreatobiliary
disease but increases the risk of exposure to the virus-containing body fluid;
however, the impact of COVID-19 on ERCP is unknown.
AIM: To compare the number of endoscopic activities and to analyze the clinical
outcomes of ERCPs before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Daegu, South Kore.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients aged ≥ 18 years who
underwent ERCP between February 18 and March 28, 2020, at a tertiary hospital.
ERCP indications and endoscopic details were compared with those from the same
period in 2018 and 2019 as control groups.
RESULTS: Of the 269 ERCP procedures, 113 (42.0%) cases were performed as
emergency procedures. The number of ERCP procedures in 2018 and 2019 decreased by
20.2% and 56.6%, respectively, compared with that in 2020 (P < 0.01); among the
113 emergency ERCPs, the observed numbers in 2018 (n = 42) and 2019 (n = 55)
dramatically dropped by 61.9% and 70.9%, respectively, compared with that in 2020
(n = 16). Of the 16 cases in 2020, stone removal was performed in five, biliary
stenting in five, sphincterotomy in five, and nasobiliary drainage in one. No
case of ERCP-related infection in medical workers or other patients has been
reported.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak significantly reduced the number of ERCPs;
however, there is no difference in the indications and endoscopic interventions
before and during the COVID-19 outbreak.
