Various stressors such as viral infection lead to the suppression of
cap-dependent translation and the activation of the integrated stress response
(ISR), since the stress-induced phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor 2 [eIF2(αP)] tightly binds to eIF2B to prevent it from exchanging guanine 
nucleotide molecules on its substrate, unphosphorylated eIF2. Sandfly fever
Sicilian virus (SFSV) evades this cap-dependent translation suppression through
the interaction between its nonstructural protein NSs and host eIF2B. However,
its precise mechanism has remained unclear. Here, our cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) analysis reveals that SFSV NSs binds to the α-subunit of eIF2B in a
competitive manner with eIF2(αP). Together with SFSV NSs, eIF2B retains
nucleotide exchange activity even in the presence of eIF2(αP), in line with the
cryo-EM structures of the eIF2B•SFSV NSs•unphosphorylated eIF2 complex. A
genome-wide ribosome profiling analysis clarified that SFSV NSs expressed in
cultured human cells attenuates the ISR triggered by thapsigargin, an endoplasmic
reticulum stress inducer. Furthermore, SFSV NSs introduced in rat hippocampal
neurons and human induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived motor neurons
exhibits neuroprotective effects against the ISR-inducing stress. Since ISR
inhibition is beneficial in various neurological disease models, SFSV NSs may be 
a promising therapeutic ISR inhibitor.
