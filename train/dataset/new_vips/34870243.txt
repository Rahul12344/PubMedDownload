In this protocol, we describe global proteome profiling for the respiratory
specimen of COVID-19 patients, Patients suspected with COVID-19, and H1N1
patients. In this protocol, details for identifying host, viral or bacterial
proteome (Meta-proteome) are provided. Major steps of the protocol include virus 
inactivation, protein quantification and digestion, desalting of peptides,
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) based analysis, and downstream
bioinformatics analysis.
