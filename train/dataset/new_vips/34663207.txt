BACKGROUND: Host inflammation contributes to determine whether SARS-CoV-2
infection causes mild or life-threatening disease. Tools are needed for early
risk assessment.
METHODS: We studied in 111 COVID-19 patients prospectively followed at a single
reference Hospital fifty-three potential biomarkers including alarmins,
cytokines, adipocytokines and growth factors, humoral innate immune and
neuroendocrine molecules and regulators of iron metabolism. Biomarkers at
hospital admission together with age, degree of hypoxia, neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine
were analysed within a data-driven approach to classify patients with respect to 
survival and ICU outcomes. Classification and regression tree (CART) models were 
used to identify prognostic biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among the fifty-three potential biomarkers, the classification tree
analysis selected CXCL10 at hospital admission, in combination with NLR and time 
from onset, as the best predictor of ICU transfer (AUC [95% CI] = 0.8374
[0.6233-0.8435]), while it was selected alone to predict death (AUC [95%
CI] = 0.7334 [0.7547-0.9201]). CXCL10 concentration abated in COVID-19 survivors 
after healing and discharge from the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 results from a data-driven analysis, that accounts for
presence of confounding factors, as the most robust predictive biomarker of
patient outcome in COVID-19.
