The Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line is among the most commonly used
cell lines for the production of influenza virus vaccines. As cell culture-based 
manufacturing is poised to replace egg-based processes, increasing virus
production is of paramount importance. To shed light on factors affecting virus
productivity, we isolated a subline, H1, which had twice the influenza virus A
(IAV) productivity of the parent (P) through cell cloning, and characterized H1
and P in detail on both physical and molecular levels. Transcriptome analysis
revealed that within a few hours after IAV infection, viral mRNAs constituted
over one fifth of total mRNA, with several viral genes more highly expressed in
H1 than P. Functional analysis of the transcriptome dynamics showed that H1 and P
responded similarly to IAV infection, and were both subjected to host shutoff and
inflammatory responses. Importantly, H1 was more active in translation and RNA
processing intrinsically and after infection. Furthermore, H1 had more subdued
inflammatory and antiviral responses. Taken together, we postulate that the high 
productivity of IAV hinges on the balance between suppression of host functions
to divert cellular resources and the sustaining of sufficient activities for
virus replication. Mechanistic insights into virus productivity can facilitate
the process optimization and cell line engineering for advancing influenza
vaccine manufacturing.
