False negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 are common and have important public health
and medical implications. We tested the hypothesis of diurnal variation in viral 
shedding by assessing the proportion of positive versus negative SARS-CoV-2
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and cycle time
(Ct) values among positive samples by the time of day. Among 86,342 clinical
tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in a regional health 
care network in the southeastern United States from March to August 2020, we
found evidence for diurnal variation in the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2
tests, with a peak around 1400 h and 1.7-fold variation over the day after
adjustment for age, sex, race, testing location, month, and day of week and lower
Ct values during the day for positive samples. These findings have important
implications for public health testing and vaccination strategies.
