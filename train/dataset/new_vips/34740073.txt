As COVID-19 spread across Brazil, it quickly reached remote regions including
Amazon's ultra-peripheral locations where patient transportation through rivers
is added to the list of obstacles to overcome. This article analyses the
pandemic's effects in the access of riverine communities to the prehospital
emergency healthcare system in the Brazilian Upper Amazon River region. To do so,
we present two studies that by using a Resilience Engineering approach aimed to
predict the functioning of the Brazilian Mobile Emergency Medical Service (SAMU) 
for riverside and coastal areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the normal
system functioning. Study I, carried out before the pandemic, applied
ethnographic methods for data collection and the Functional Resonance Analysis
Method - FRAM for data analysis in order to develop a model of the mobile
emergency care in the region during typical conditions of operation. Study II
then estimated how changes in variability dynamics would alter system functioning
during the pandemic, arriving at three trends that could lead the service to
collapse. Finally, the accuracy of predictions is discussed after the pandemic
first peaked in the region. Findings reveal that relatively small changes in
variability dynamics can deliver strong implications to operating care and safety
of expeditions aboard water ambulances. Also, important elements that add to the 
resilient capabilities of the system are extra-organizational, and thus during
the pandemic safety became jeopardized as informal support networks grew fragile.
Using FRAM for modelling regular operation enabled prospective scenario analysis 
that accurately predicted disruptions in providing emergency care to riverine
population.
