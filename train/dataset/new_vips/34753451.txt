BACKGROUND: The global spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia is still
continuing, and a new round of more serious outbreaks has even begun in some
countries. In this context, this paper studies the dynamics of a type of delayed 
reaction-diffusion novel coronavirus pneumonia model with relapse and
self-limiting treatment in a temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment.
METHODS: First, focus on the self-limiting characteristics of COVID-19,
incorporate the relapse and self-limiting treatment factors into the diffusion
model, and study the influence of self-limiting treatment on the diffusion of the
epidemic. Second, because the traditional Lyapunov stability method is difficult 
to determine the spread of the epidemic with relapse and self-limiting treatment,
we introduce a completely different method, relying on the existence conditions
of the exponential attractor of our newly established in the infinite-dimensional
dynamic system to determine the diffusion of novel coronavirus pneumonia. Third, 
relapse and self-limiting treatment have led to a change in the structure of the 
delayed diffusion COVID-19 model, and the traditional basic reproduction number
[Formula: see text] no longer has threshold characteristics. With the help of the
Krein-Rutman theorem and the eigenvalue method, we studied the threshold
characteristics of the principal eigenvalue and found that it can be used as a
new threshold to describe the diffusion of the epidemic.
RESULTS: Our results prove that the principal eigenvalue [Formula: see text] of
the delayed reaction-diffusion COVID-19 system with relapse and self-limiting
treatment can replace the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] to
describe the threshold effect of disease transmission. Combine with the latest
official data and the prevention and control strategies, some numerical
simulations on the stability and global exponential attractiveness of the
diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and the USA are given.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the comparison of numerical simulations, we find that
self-limiting treatment can significantly promote the prevention and control of
the epidemic. And if the free activities of asymptomatic infected persons are not
restricted, it will seriously hinder the progress of epidemic prevention and
control.
