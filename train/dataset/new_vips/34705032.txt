CONTEXT.—: The histologic features in patients with acute-on-chronic liver
failure (ACLF) are evolving and histologic indicators of patients' poor prognosis
are not yet fully established.
OBJECTIVE.—: To evaluate the independent histologic predictors of 28-day
mortality in ACLF patients on core-needle liver biopsies.
DESIGN.—: Core-needle biopsies from patients with a diagnosis of ACLF (n = 152)
as per the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria were included
during 8 years. Liver biopsies from 98 patients with compensated chronic liver
disease were included as disease controls for histologic comparison. Features of 
ongoing changes, such as hepatic necrosis, hepatic apoptosis, cholestasis,
hepatocyte degeneration, bile ductular proliferation, Mallory Denk bodies,
steatosis, and extent of liver fibrosis, were analyzed for predicting short-term 
mortality (28 days). A P value of <.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS.—: In our cohort of ACLF patients, the following etiologies for acute
decompensation were identified: alcohol, 47 of 152 (30.9%); sepsis, 24 of 152
(15.7%); hepatotropic viruses, 20 of 152 (13.1%); drug-induced liver injury, 11
of 152 (7.2%); autoimmune flare, 9 of 152 (5.9%); mixed etiologies, 5 of 152
(3.2%); and cryptogenic, 36 of 152 (23.6%). On histologic examination, hepatic
necrosis (P < .001), dense lobular inflammation (P = .03), cholestasis (P <
.001), ductular reaction (P = .001), hepatocyte degeneration (P < .001), and
absence of advanced fibrosis stages (P < .001) were identified significantly more
in ACLF patients than in disease controls on univariate analysis. On multivariate
Cox regression analysis, the absence of advanced Ishak histologic activity index 
fibrosis stages (P = .02) and the presence of dense lobular inflammation (P =
.04) were associated with increased 28-day mortality in ACLF patients. After
adjusting the clinical causes of acute decompensation, only dense lobular
inflammation was found as an independent predictor of short-term mortality (P =
.04) in ACLF patients.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Dense lobular necroinflammatory activity is a clinically
independent histologic predictor of 28-day short-term mortality in patients with 
ACLF.
