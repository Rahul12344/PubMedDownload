BACKGROUND: England's COVID-19 roadmap out of lockdown policy set out the
timeline and conditions for the stepwise lifting of non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) as vaccination roll-out continued, with step one starting on
March 8, 2021. In this study, we assess the roadmap, the impact of the delta
(B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2, and potential future epidemic trajectories.
METHODS: This mathematical modelling study was done to assess the UK Government's
four-step process to easing lockdown restrictions in England, UK. We extended a
previously described model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to incorporate vaccination 
and multi-strain dynamics to explicitly capture the emergence of the delta
variant. We calibrated the model to English surveillance data, including hospital
admissions, hospital occupancy, seroprevalence data, and population-level PCR
testing data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, then modelled the
potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for
relaxing NPIs. We estimated the resulting number of daily infections and hospital
admissions, and daily and cumulative deaths. Three scenarios spanning a range of 
optimistic to pessimistic vaccine effectiveness, waning natural immunity, and
cross-protection from previous infections were investigated. We also considered
three levels of mixing after the lifting of restrictions.
FINDINGS: The roadmap policy was successful in offsetting the increased
transmission resulting from lifting NPIs starting on March 8, 2021, with
increasing population immunity through vaccination. However, because of the
emergence of the delta variant, with an estimated transmission advantage of 76%
(95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69-83) over alpha, fully lifting NPIs on June
21, 2021, as originally planned might have led to 3900 (95% CrI 1500-5700) peak
daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario. Delaying until
July 19, 2021, reduced peak hospital admissions by three fold to 1400 (95% CrI
700-1700) per day. There was substantial uncertainty in the epidemic trajectory, 
with particular sensitivity to the transmissibility of delta, level of mixing,
and estimates of vaccine effectiveness.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID-19
hospital admissions resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if
the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. 
However, with the delta variant, it might not be possible to fully lift NPIs
without a third wave of hospital admissions and deaths, even if vaccination
coverage is high. Variants of concern, their transmissibility, vaccine uptake,
and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic
control measures.
