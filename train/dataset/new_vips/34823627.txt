Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are lung-resident myeloid cells that sit at the
interface of the airway and lung tissue. Under homeostatic conditions, their
primary function is to clear debris, dead cells and excess surfactant from the
airways. They also serve as innate pulmonary sentinels for respiratory pathogens 
and environmental airborne particles and as regulators of pulmonary inflammation.
However, they have not typically been viewed as primary therapeutic targets for
respiratory diseases. Here, we discuss the role of AMs in various lung diseases, 
explore the potential therapeutic strategies to target these innate cells and
weigh the potential risks and challenges of such therapies. Additionally, in the 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the role AMs play in severe disease 
and the therapeutic strategies that have been harnessed to modulate their
function and protect against severe lung damage. There are many novel approaches 
in development to target AMs, such as inhaled antibiotics, liposomal and
microparticle delivery systems, and host-directed therapies, which have the
potential to provide critical treatment to patients suffering from severe
respiratory diseases, yet there is still much work to be done to fully understand
the possible benefits and risks of such approaches.
