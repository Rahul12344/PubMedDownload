OBJECTIVES: In 2012, onetime hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening was recommended
for all baby boomers (people born during 1945-1965) in the United States, but
only 4.0%-12.9% of baby boomers have ever had a screening ordered by a health
care provider. This study examined the HCV screening prevalence among adult
patients in a large academic health care system and assessed factors associated
with the completion of screening when ordered for baby boomers.
METHODS: We defined HCV screening completion as the completion of an HCV antibody
test when it was ordered. We used electronic health records to examine HCV
screening completion rates among adults (N = 106 630) from August 1, 2015,
through July 31, 2020, by birth cohort. Among baby boomers whose health care
provider ordered HCV screening, we examined frequency and percentages of HCV
screening completion by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We
conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess
factors associated with HCV screening completion among baby boomers.
RESULTS: During the study period, 73.0% of baby boomers completed HCV screening
when it was ordered. HCV completion did not differ by sex or race and ethnicity
among baby boomers. Baby boomers with Medicare supplemental health insurance
compared with commercial health insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.87) and 
those seeing only advanced practice professionals compared with specialty care
physicians (aOR = 2.24) were more likely to complete HCV screening when it was
ordered.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncompletion of HCV screening is one of many barriers along the HCV
treatment continuum. Our findings suggest a need for interventions targeting
systems, health care providers, and patients to increase HCV screening rates in
the United States.
