The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic devastated the world economy. Global
infections and deaths altered the behaviors of generations. The Internet acted as
an incredible vehicle for communication but was also a source of unfounded
rumors. Unfortunately, this freedom of information sharing and fear of COVID-19
fostered unfounded claims about transmission (e.g., 5G networks spread the
disease). With negligible enforcement to stop the spread of rumors and government
officials spouting unfounded claims, falsities became ubiquitous. Organizations, 
public health officials, researchers, and businesses spent limited resources
addressing rumors instead of implementing policies to overcome challenges (e.g., 
speaking to defiant mask wearers versus safe reopening actions). The researchers 
defined COVID-19 transmission misinformation as false beliefs about the spread
and prevention of contracting the disease. Design and validation of the 12-item
COVID-19 Transmission Misinformation Scale (CTMS) provides a measure to identify 
transmission misinformation believers. Indirect COVID-19 transmission
misinformation beliefs with a fear of COVID-19 decreased wearing a mask in public
intentions. Callousness exacerbated COVID-19 transmission misinformation beliefs 
as a moderator.
