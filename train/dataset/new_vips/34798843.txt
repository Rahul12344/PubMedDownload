BACKGROUND: This study seeks to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on knowledge,
attitude, and infection control behaviors among dentists.
METHODS: Changes in knowledge, attitude, and infection control behaviors reported
in 2020 (COVID-19 period) were compared to the historical control of the
non-COVID-19 period in 2018. A proportional random sampling method was used to
select the study samples from 400 dental institutions. The response rate was 69% 
in 2018 and 62.8% in 2020. A total of 276 dentists in 2018 and 251 dentists in
2020 responded to this questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was used to
assess the associations between factors and recommended infection control
practices.
RESULTS: High rates of correct COVID-19 knowledge (94.76%), fears of being
infected with the virus (94%) and use of personal protective equipment (mask,
glove and protection gown; 95%) were reported. We found that knowledge regarding 
environmental infection control, HIV transmission, and the window of HIV
transmission were significantly higher in the post-COVID-19 period compared with 
the pre-COVID-19 period. High compliance rates of wearing mask, gloves and
protection were reported. The number of dentists wearing a hair cap and a
protective eye mask/face shield during the pandemic significantly increased
compared with that noted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with
the use of a hair cap and an eye mask/face shield differed between the pre- and
post-COVID-19 periods. The factors associated with compliance regarding
environment infection control also differed between the pre- and post-COVID-19
periods.
CONCLUSION: The significant impact of COVID-19 on the knowledge, attitude, and
infection control behaviors among dental care workers was observed in the current
study. In particular, the use of hair caps and protective eye mask or face
shields as well as environmental disinfection protocols has significantly
improved. Trial registration TMU-JIRB: N201804006.
