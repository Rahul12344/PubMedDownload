AIM: To evaluate the effects of hsa-miRNA-143-3p on the cytodifferentiation of
human stem cells from the apical papillary (hSCAPs) and the post-transcriptional 
regulation of Nuclear factor I-C (NFIC).
METHODOLOGY: miRNA expression profiles in human immature permanent teeth and
during hSCAP differentiation were examined. hSCAPs were treated with miR-143-3p
overexpression or silencing viruses, and the proliferation and odontogenic and
osteogenic differentiation of these stem cells, and the involvement of the NFIC
pathway, were investigated. Luciferase reporter and NFIC mutant plasmids were
used to confirm NFIC mRNA as a direct target of miR-143-3p. NFIC expression
analysis in the miR-143-3p overexpressing hSCAPs was used to investigate whether 
miR-143-3p functioned by targeting NFIC. Student's t-test and chi-square tests
were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: miR-143-3p expression was screened by microarray profiling and was found
to be significantly reduced during hSCAP differentiation (P < 0.05).
Overexpression of miR-143-3p inhibited the mineralization of hSCAPs significantly
(P < 0.05) and downregulated the levels of odontogenic differentiation markers
[NFIC (P < 0.05), DSP (P < 0.01) and KLF4 (P < 0.01)], whereas silencing of
miR-143-3p had the opposite effect. The luciferase reporter gene detection and
bioinformatic approaches identified NFIC mRNA as a potential target of
miR-143-3p. NFIC overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-143-3p on
the odontogenic differentiation of hSCAPs.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-143-3p maintained the stemness of hSCAPs and modulated their
differentiation negatively by directly targeting NFIC. Thus, inhibition of this
miRNA represents a potential strategy to promote the regeneration of damaged
tooth roots.
