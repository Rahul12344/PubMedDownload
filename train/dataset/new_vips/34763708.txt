OBJECTIVES: Accelerated atherosclerosis in older HIV-infected patients has been
attributed to persistent immune activation and high burden cytomegalovirus (CMV),
as demonstrated in transplant recipients and the general population. Here we
assess CMV and inflammatory markers linked with vascular health in young adult
patients treated in Indonesia.
STUDY DESIGN: HIV-infected adults (n = 32) were examined when they began
antiretroviral therapy (ART) with < 200 CD4 T-cells/µl (V0) and after 60 months
(V60). Age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 32) were assessed once.
METHODS: Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) was assessed by ultrasound on brachial
arteries at V60 and in HC. Plasma markers of immune activation and endothelial
activation, and CMV antibodies (lysate, gB, IE-1) were assessed in all samples.
Results were assessed using bivariate (non-parametric) and multivariable
analyses.
RESULTS: Levels of inflammatory biomarkers and CMV antibodies declined on ART,
but the antibodies remained higher than in HC. FMD values were similar in
patients and HC at V60. In HIV patients, levels of CMV lysate antibody correlated
inversely (r = - 0.37) with FMD. The optimal model predicting lower FMD values
(adjusted R2 = 0.214, p = 0.012) included CMV lysate antibodies and chondroitin
sulphate. In HC, levels of sTNFR correlated inversely with FMD (r = - 0.41) and
remained as a risk factor in the optimal multivariable model, with CMV
glycoprotein-B (gB) antibody predicting a healthier FMD (adjusted R2 = 0.248,
p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels CMV antibodies optimally predict vascular health
measured by FMD in HIV patients. However in healthy controls, sTNFR marks risk
and CMV gB antibody may be protective.
