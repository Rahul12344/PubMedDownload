Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has affected hundreds of millions of
people globally. The development of safe and effective vaccines represents an
urgent demand. A total of 136 participants were recruited in this study,
including 75 men and 61 women. The participants were divided into two groups:
those who were virus naïve (never infected) and those who had recovered from
COVID-19. Each group included individuals who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech
BNT162b2 mRNA or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine. Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure anti-S IgG antibody
concentrations in sequential serum samples obtained before vaccine
administration, after the first vaccine dose, and after the second vaccine dose. 
We compared the antibody responses of individuals with confirmed prior COVID-19
infection with those of individuals without prior evidence of infection. All
participants who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 who received one dose
of either the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1
COVID-19 vaccine showed significant anti-S IgG antibody levels. No sex-related
differences were observed when we compared antibody levels between men and women.
In infection-naïve participants ≥60 years, a second vaccine dose was necessary to
achieve higher levels of antibody when comparing the IgG antibody levels after
receiving the first and second dose.
