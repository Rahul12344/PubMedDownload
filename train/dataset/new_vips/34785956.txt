Introduction: Since the launch of universal "test and treat" approach in 2016,
there has been a significant increase in persons initiated on antiretroviral
therapy (ART) on the same-day of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis in 
low-income settings. However, there are limited studies that investigated the
effect of rapid treatment initiation on adherence. In this study, we compared
adherence to ART in people who started ART on the same-day of HIV diagnosis and
those started more than 7 days after HIV diagnosis.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using routinely collected
data from multiple ART clinics. Participants were at least 15 years old, were
newly diagnosed and started on ART between October 2016 and July 2018 in the
Amhara region of Ethiopia. We used doubly-robust multivariable logistic
regression model to estimate the adjusted effects on adherence.
Results: A total of 415 individuals who started ART on the same-day of HIV
diagnosis and 527 individuals who started 7 days after their HIV diagnosis were
included in the analysis. The proportion of participants who reported optimal
adherence was significantly lower in the same-day group at 6- and 12-months
(absolute risk difference of 6.5%; 95% CI: 1.1%, 11.9% and 6.8%; 95% CI: 1.2%,
12.5%, respectively) compared to the >7 days group. After adjusting for baseline 
and non-baseline covariates, the same-day group was less likely to have optimal
adherence both at 6- and 12-months (adjusted RR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.94 and
RR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.95, respectively) compared to the >7 days group.
Conclusion: We observed lower optimal adherence among individuals who started ART
on the same-day of HIV diagnosis compared to those who started ART >7 days after 
their HIV diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying
adherence barriers, providing support, and ensuring treatment readiness before
initiating individuals on same-day ART.
