Background and Purpose: The advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been
implicated in different diseases' pathogenesis, but their role in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) is still a matter of debate. This study aims to investigate the
association of AGEs with HCC development in patients with hepatitis C-related
cirrhosis.
Methods: Only 153 of the 181 non-diabetic patients with cirrhosis were
consecutively involved in this pilot cohort prospective study, along with 34
healthy control participants. Demographic characteristics, biochemical
parameters, clinical data, and AGEs levels in all subjects at the starting point 
and every year after that for two years were assessed. Multivariable Cox
regression analysis was used to settle variables that could predict HCC
development within this period.
Results: HCC developed in 13 (8.5%) patients. Univariate Cox regression analysis 
reported that body mass index (P=0.013), homeostatic model assessment-insulin
resistance (P=0.006), alpha-fetoprotein (P <0.001), and AGEs levels (P <0.001)
were related to HCC development. After adjusting multiple confounders, the
multivariable Cox regression model has revealed that AFP and AGEs were the
powerful parameters related to the HCC occurrence (all P<0.05). AGEs at a cutoff 
value of more than 79.6 ng/ml had 100% sensitivity, 96.4% specificity, and 0.999 
area under the curve (all P<0.001), using the receiver operating characteristic
curve, for prediction of HCC development.
Conclusion: This work suggests that AGEs are associated with an increased
incidence of HCC, particularly in cirrhosis, which is encouraging in decreasing
the risk of HCC in these patients.
