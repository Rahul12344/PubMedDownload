BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter medication overdose is a difficult diagnostic
challenge for many physicians as common drug screening assays cannot detect these
substances. We present a case of acute psychosis, serotonin syndrome, and
anticholinergic overdose-like properties in the setting of Coricidin HBP Cough & 
Cold tablets, known by their street name Triple-C. This is the first case report 
we are aware of involving a patient presenting with these symptoms and requiring 
critical-care-level support.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old African American female with a past medical
history of anxiety, childhood asthma, previous methamphetamine abuse, and
coronavirus disease 2019 infection in August 2020 was brought to the emergency
department by the local police department with altered mental status. Initial
blood work, including extended drug screens, were unremarkable for a definitive
diagnosis. This patient required critical-care-level support and high sedation
because of her symptoms. Collateral history revealed the patient regularly
consumed Triple-C daily for the 6 weeks prior to admission. A trial off sedation 
was attempted after 24 hours with no complications. The patient admitted to
regular Triple-C consumption and auditory hallucinations since adolescence. She
was discharged safely after 48 hours back into the community. She was lost to
follow-up with psychiatry and internal medicine; however, she was evaluated in
the emergency room 1 month later with a similar psychiatric presentation.
CONCLUSION: Overdose of Triple-C should be kept in the differential diagnosis of 
patients presenting with a triad of psychosis, serotonin syndrome, and
anticholinergic overdose, in the setting of unknown substance ingestion.
