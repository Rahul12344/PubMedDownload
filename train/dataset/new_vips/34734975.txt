Importance: A comprehensive understanding of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination
requires consideration of disease attenuation, determined as whether people who
develop COVID-19 despite vaccination have lower disease severity than
unvaccinated people.
Objective: To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19
vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19
hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association 
with progression to critical disease.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513
adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome
data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through 
July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021.
Exposures: COVID-19 vaccination.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination
and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those
hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an
alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized
for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without
progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were
measured with multivariable logistic regression.
Results: Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%]
women; 23.0% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and
20.1% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with
COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted
for 84.2% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 
was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases,
15.8%; controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and
Delta variants (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association
was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI,
0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised patients (40.1% vs 58.8%; aOR, 0.49; 95% CI,
0.35-0.69) (P < .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with
BNT162b2 (5.8% vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% 
vs 8.3%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P < .001). Among 1197 patients
hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28
was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0% vs 24.7%; aOR,
0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58).
Conclusions and Relevance: Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was
significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and
disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are
consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared
with absence of vaccination.
