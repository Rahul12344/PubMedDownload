OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine a threshold cutoff for hepcidin, ferritin, and 
the hepcidin-to-ferritin ratio in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in chronic
hepatitis C virus (HCV)-free ß-thalassemia major patients with iron overload.
METHODS: This 1:1-matched case-control study included 102 individuals (3-30 yr.);
51 patients with iron overload anemia, and 51 apparently healthy individuals.
RESULTS: The highest areas under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic)
curves (AUC-ROCs) for the diagnosis of patients vs. controls had overlapping 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs): serum hepcidin (0.758; 0.64-0.87; P ˂ 0.001), serum
ferritin (1.000; 1.00-1.00; P ˂ 0.001), and the hepcidin/ferritin ratio (1.000;
1.00-1.00; P ˂ 0.001). For differentiation of patients with liver fibrosis stages
of F0-F1 vs. F2-F4 and F0-F1 vs. F3-F4, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) with P-values ˂ 0.001 were the only statistically 
significant parameters, while the AUC-ROCs of the hepcidin/ferritin ratio (0.631,
P = 0.188 and 0.684, P = 0.098) exhibited 90% and 89.5% sensitivity,
respectively, in staging liver fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: The hepcidin/ferritin ratio is suggested as an aspartate
aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) to differentiate liver
fibrosis patients. This ratio may have excellent sensitivity in the prediction of
liver fibrosis.
