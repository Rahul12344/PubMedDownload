Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a specific high frequency cell
surface marker of prostate cancers. Theranostic approaches targeting PSMA show no
major adverse effects and rule out off-tumor toxicity. A PSMA-retargeted oHSV
(R-405) was generated which both infected and was cytotoxic exclusively for
PSMA-positive cells, including human prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, and
spared PSMA-negative cells. R-405 in vivo efficacy against LLC1-PSMA and
Renca-PSMA tumors consisted of inhibiting primary tumor growth, establishing
long-term T immune response, immune heating of the microenvironment,
de-repression of the anti-tumor immune phenotype, and sensitization to checkpoint
blockade. The in situ vaccination protected from distant challenge tumors, both
PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative, implying that it was addressed also to LLC1
tumor antigens. PSMA-retargeted oHSVs are a precision medicine tool worth being
additionally investigated in the immunotherapeutic and in situ vaccination
landscape against prostate cancers.
