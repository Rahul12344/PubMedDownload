Health care workers (HCWs) working in different health care facilities are
exposed to many hazards, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
questionnaire-based cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence,
pattern, and risk factors of occupational health hazards faced by 438 randomly
selected HCWs from northern Saudi Arabia. The HCWs are commonly exposed to needle
stick injuries (34.5%) under the biological hazards category; and work-related
stress (69.6%) under the non-biological hazards categories. The significant
associated factors were work setting (ref: Primary Health Center: Adjusted OR
(AOR) = 2.81, 95%CI = 1.21-4.59, p = 0.017), smoking status (ref.: non-smoker:
AOR = 1.73, 95%CI = 1.03-2.91, p = 0.039), and mean sleeping duration per day
(AOR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.04-1.43, p = 0.014) for biological, and smoking status
(ref: non-smoker: AOR = 2.16, 95%CI = 1.09-3.29, p = 0.028), and mean sleeping
duration per day (AOR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.07-1.70, p = 0.013) for non-biological
categories. This study revealed several risk factors and occupational health
hazards that HCWs are exposed to during their work time. Periodic training and
follow-up assessments regarding bio-safety measures for the HCWs should be
implemented. Finally, future explorative studies are warranted on the feasibility
of implementing rotation-based postings for the HCWs in different health care
settings.
