The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, and then the virus has 
spread throughout the world, which led to lockdown in different countries,
including Iran. Restrictions on transportation and travel of personnel caused
some shortages in aquaculture, particularly in shrimp farms. This study aims to
evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the shrimp farming industry in
Iran. An online questionnaire was designed to collect information from shrimp
farmers, material suppliers, food preparing factories, managers of shrimp
hatchery centers, and shrimp exporters. Our results showed that the COVID-19
outbreak has significantly decreased the shrimp annual sales, export, and price
in Iran. Also, the production of larvae was affected by COVID-19. Shrimp farming 
industries are still subject to impacts of the pandemic by reducing hatchery
production, shrimp demand, and increasing production and transportation costs.
