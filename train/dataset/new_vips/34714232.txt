INTRODUCTION: The safety and effectiveness of natalizumab in patients with
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) has been demonstrated in clinical
trials. However, due to the limitations of these trials, it is important to know 
how the condition behaves under long-term clinical practice conditions.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effectiveness of natalizumab in patients
with RRMS by means of annual evaluation of the "no evidence of disease activity" 
(NEDA) parameter, which includes number of relapses, disability (measured with
the Expanded Disability Status Scale), and brain MRI parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with RRMS
from 3 centres who were treated with one or more doses of natalizumab. Each year,
we evaluated NEDA status and safety based on the percentage of patients who
discontinued treatment with natalizumab and experienced adverse reactions.
RESULTS: The study included 89 patients, most of whom received treatment for 2 to
4 years, with a follow-up period of up to 7 years. Natalizumab significantly
reduces the radiological and clinical progression of the disease, as well as the 
annual rate of relapses. The NEDA parameter demonstrates the effectiveness of the
drug, with values of 75.28% for year one and 66.67% for year 7. Twenty-five
patients (28.1%) dropped out after a median of 4 years. Fourteen of these
patients (56%) dropped out due to the appearance of anti-JC virus antibodies,
either in isolation or associated with another cause. Four dropouts (16%) were
due to treatment ineffectiveness, with one patient dying due to progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Natalizumab is highly effective as measured by the NEDA long-term
remission parameter.
