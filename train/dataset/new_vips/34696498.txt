Human norovirus (HuNoV) infection is a global health and economic burden.
Currently, there are no licensed HuNoV vaccines or antiviral drugs available. The
protease encoded by the HuNoV genome plays a critical role in virus replication
by cleaving the polyprotein and is an excellent target for developing
small-molecule inhibitors. The current strategy for developing HuNoV protease
inhibitors is by targeting the enzyme's active site and designing inhibitors that
bind to the substrate-binding pockets located near the active site. However,
subtle differential conformational flexibility in response to the different
substrates in the polyprotein and structural differences in the active site and
substrate-binding pockets across different genogroups, hamper the development of 
effective broad-spectrum inhibitors. A comparative analysis of the available
HuNoV protease structures may provide valuable insight for identifying novel
strategies for the design and development of such inhibitors. The goal of this
review is to provide such analysis together with an overview of the current
status of the design and development of HuNoV protease inhibitors.
