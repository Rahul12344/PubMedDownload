Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the
mental health of the population in general, and in college students in
particular. Dental students have seen their teaching altered and their clinical
practice reduced. This study was aimed at conducting a systematic review and
meta-analysis of studies reporting levels of depression among dental students
during the COVID-19 and estimating the pooled prevalence of depression. Materials
and Methods: Medline via PubMed and other databases were searched for studies on 
the prevalence of depression in dental undergraduates, published from 1 December 
2019 to 1 September 2021. The pooled proportions of depression were calculated
with random effects models. Results: We identified 13 studies from 9 countries.
The pooled prevalence of depression in dental students was 37% (95% CI: 26-49%)
with no variation due to gender, response rate or methodological quality. We only
found a significantly higher prevalence of depression in studies from Asia
compared to Europe and America. Conclusions: Our results suggest that dental
students are suffering from higher levels of depression compared with the general
population or other college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with
differences across regions. Measures to improve mental health and wellbeing of
dental students during the pandemic are needed.
