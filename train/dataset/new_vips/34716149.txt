Acute COVID-19 usually lasts 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. We report two
cases of COVID-19-associated organising pneumonia (OP) occurring beyond 4 weeks
from the acute onset of symptoms. Both tested positive for SARS reverse
transcription-PCR 2 months before presentation with a resolution of respiratory
symptoms. The first case presented with residual fatigue and worsening exertional
dyspnoea. Chest CT revealed an OP pattern. The second case presented with
worsening cough and new-onset pleuritic chest pain with persistent radiological
consolidation. A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed OP. Both patients responded
well to 12 weeks of steroid therapy. This case illustrates the rare presentation 
of OP as a late sequela of COVID-19 and the good response to steroid therapy.
