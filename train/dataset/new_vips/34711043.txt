OBJECTIVES: to assess the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
symptoms in a sample of Italian citizens during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave 
and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, housing conditions,
and lifestyles modifications.
DESIGN: cross-sectional survey.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between 21st April and 7th June 2020, a
self-administered online questionnaire aiming at investigating mental well-being 
and lifestyle habits during the lockdown period was disseminated online.
Respondents were recruited through a snowball sampling.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PTSD symptoms were assessed using a validated screening
tool, the SPAN (Startle, Physiological arousal, Anger, Numbness) questionnaire.
RESULTS: the study population is composed of 6,687 participants, of whom 71.5%
were females. The mean age of the sample was 48.7 years. Globally, 43.8% of the
participants reported symptoms of PTSD, especially females. PTSD prevalence
showed a decreasing trend across age groups. The likelihood of PTSD symptoms was 
higher among those who increased alcohol consumption, decreased physical
activity, and experienced restless sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms emerged from this survey,
especially among women and younger subjects. Preventive strategies should be
implemented to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable citizens in a
period of emergency.
