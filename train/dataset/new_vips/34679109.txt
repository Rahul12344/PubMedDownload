BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics
and outcome of patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia
admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care center in the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE) and to identify early risk factors for in-hospital mortality 
in these patients.
METHODS: A total of 371 adult patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICU of Al Ain 
Hospital between March 16 and July 19, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed
using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) on
nasopharyngeal swabs were included.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53 years (standard deviation = 13). Patients
were mostly male (n = 314 [84.6%]) and of South Asian origin (n = 231 [62.3%]).
Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 182 (49.1%) patients for a median
of 11 days (25-75% interquartile range: 6-17). During the ICU stay, renal
replacement therapy was required in 87 (23.5%) and vasopressor therapy in 190
(51.2%) patients. ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQ: 5-17) and 18 (IQ: 
13-29) days, respectively and ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 20.2%.
In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable,
greater Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on ICU admission,
diarrhea prior to hospital admission, greater, admission from hospital ward, and 
higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio on admission 
to the ICU were independently associated with higher risk of in-hospital
mortality.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital
in the UAE, COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with high morbidity and mortality
rates. Identifying patients at high risk of death may help detect future
therapeutic targets.
