A causal relationship between plasma ceramide concentration and respiratory
distress symptoms in COVID-19 patients is inferred. In this study, plasma samples
of 52 individuals infected with COVID-19 were utilized in a lipidomic analysis.
Lipids belonging to the ceramide class exhibited a 400-fold increase in total
plasma concentration in infected patients. Further analysis led to the
demonstration of concentration dependency for severe COVID-19 respiratory
symptoms in a subclass of ceramides. The subclasses Cer(d18:0/24:1),
Cer(d18:1/24:1), and Cer(d18:1/22:0) were shown to be increased by 48-, 40-, and 
33-fold, respectively, in infected plasma samples and to 116-, 91- and 50-fold,
respectively, in plasma samples with respiratory distress. Hence, monitoring
plasma ceramide concentration, can be a valuable tool for measuring effects of
therapies on COVID-19 respiratory distress patients.
