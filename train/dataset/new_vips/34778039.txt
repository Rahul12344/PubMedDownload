Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that arises from the mucosal
epithelium of the nasopharynx, and its prognosis is relatively favorable. The
5-year overall survival rate in patients with locally advanced NPC currently
exceeds 80%, but the development of individualized diagnosis and treatment at the
molecular level is relatively lacking. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is the
generic term for tumor cells that are present in the peripheral
blood circulation. As a new biomarker with good clinical application prospects,
the detection of CTCs has the advantages of being non-invasive, simple, and
repeatable. By capturing and detecting CTCs in peripheral blood and monitoring
the dynamic variation of its type and quantity, we can assess the biological
characteristics of tumor in a timely manner and evaluate the therapeutic effect
and prognosis of patients in advance, which will help to develop individualized
treatments of tumors. The primary purposes of this review were the clinical
application of CTCs in tumor stage determination, treatment efficacy evaluation, 
and prognosis prediction of NPC. In addition, we estimated the correlation
between Epstein-Barr virus infection and CTCs and analyzed the difference in
karyotypes and specific markers expressed on CTCs. We believe that our study will
provide new insights and biomarkers for the individualized treatment of patients 
with NPC.
