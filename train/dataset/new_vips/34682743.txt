Healthcare workers (HCW) play a vital role in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control.
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and
the risk of COVID-19 infections in a cohort of HCW from four different risk
groups (from intensive care unit to administration) of a hospital of a primary
care level in rural Germany. The outcomes were monthly measures of antibody
seroprevalence over a period of 6 months. Overall, a seroprevalence of 13.41% was
determined, with significantly higher prevalence rates among HCW working in areas
with more frequent contact to confirmed or suspected cases (30.30%, p = 0.003).
The group specific differences in the risk of infection from COVID-19 were
detected, as HCW groups with frequent exposure seemed to have an increased risk
(RR = 3.18, p = 0.02; CI95 1.09-9.24). The findings contribute to the
epidemiological understanding of the virus spread in an unvaccinated population
group, which is highly relevant for the pandemic management.
