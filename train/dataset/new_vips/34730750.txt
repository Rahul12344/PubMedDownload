The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is significantly causing
unprecedented clinical, socioeconomic, and public health challenges globally. The
successful global administration of effective, safe and sustainable vaccine(s) is
widely believed to be crucial in mitigating as well as preventing COVID-19.
However, the rising cases of severe adverse events following immunization (AEFI) 
with COVID-19 vaccines including thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and in some
instances, death have created serious global concerns and could enormously
contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Although the complete underlying pathophysiology
and immunopathology of the COVID-19 vaccines related to AEFI, including
thrombosis and/or anaphylaxis, are yet to be determined, exploring possible
immuno-hypersensitivity could be crucial in the mechanisms associated with these 
reactions, thereby mitigating their occurrences as well as restoring confidence
in vaccine administration for a COVID-19 free world.
