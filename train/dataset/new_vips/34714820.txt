BACKGROUND: We investigated safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the
heterologous 2-dose Ebola vaccination regimen in healthy and HIV-infected adults 
with different intervals between Ebola vaccinations.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled
Phase II trial, 668 healthy 18- to 70-year-olds and 142 HIV-infected 18- to
50-year-olds were enrolled from 1 site in Kenya and 2 sites each in Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, and Uganda. Participants received intramuscular Ad26.ZEBOV
followed by MVA-BN-Filo at 28-, 56-, or 84-day intervals, or saline. Females
represented 31.4% of the healthy adult cohort in contrast to 69.7% of the
HIV-infected cohort. A subset of healthy adults received booster vaccination with
Ad26.ZEBOV or saline at Day 365. Following vaccinations, adverse events (AEs)
were collected until 42 days post last vaccination and serious AEs (SAEs) were
recorded from signing of the ICF until the end of the study. The primary endpoint
was safety, and the secondary endpoint was immunogenicity. Anti-Ebola virus
glycoprotein (EBOV GP) binding and neutralising antibodies were measured at
baseline and at predefined time points throughout the study. The first
participant was enrolled on 9 November 2015, and the date of last participant's
last visit was 12 February 2019. No vaccine-related SAEs and mainly
mild-to-moderate AEs were observed among the participants. The most frequent
solicited AEs were injection-site pain (local), and fatigue, headache, and
myalgia (systemic), respectively. Twenty-one days post-MVA-BN-Filo vaccination,
geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EBOV 
GP binding antibodies in healthy adults in 28-, 56-, and 84-day interval groups
were 3,085 EU/mL (2,648 to 3,594), 7,518 EU/mL (6,468 to 8,740), and 7,300 EU/mL 
(5,116 to 10,417), respectively. In HIV-infected adults in 28- and 56-day
interval groups, GMCs were 4,207 EU/mL (3,233 to 5,474) and 5,283 EU/mL (4,094 to
6,817), respectively. Antibody responses were observed until Day 365. Ad26.ZEBOV 
booster vaccination after 1 year induced an anamnestic response. Study
limitations include that some healthy adult participants either did not receive
dose 2 or received dose 2 outside of their protocol-defined interval and that the
follow-up period was limited to 365 days for most participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccination was well tolerated and
immunogenic in healthy and HIV-infected African adults. Increasing the interval
between vaccinations from 28 to 56 days improved the magnitude of humoral immune 
responses. Antibody levels persisted to at least 1 year, and Ad26.ZEBOV booster
vaccination demonstrated the presence of vaccination-induced immune memory. These
data supported the approval by the European Union for prophylaxis against EBOV
disease in adults and children ≥1 year of age.
