Tilapia Lake Virus Disease (TiLVD) is caused by Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV), and it
has a cumulative mortality rate of up to 90% in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis
niloticus). TiLV is a negative enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with 10
genomic segments. Segment 5 (S5) and segment 6 (S6) were predicted to include a
signaling peptide, suggesting that the encoded proteins of these two segments may
exist as part of the virus envelope. Based on bioinformatic predictions, the S5
and S6 proteins in this study were produced, including S527-343, S527-172,
S5196-272, S630-317, S630-190, and S6200-317. All proteins were tested for their 
expression in Escherichia coli. Only S5196-272 and S6200-317 were expressed as
soluble and insoluble proteins, respectively. The soluble protein was purified
using affinity chromatography, whereas the insoluble protein was solubilized
using 6 M urea lysis buffer before purification. Both proteins were further
purified using gel filtration chromatography, and the results showed a symmetric 
peak of both proteins suggested a high degree of uniformity in the conformation
of these proteins. Antigenicity results indicated that these proteins were
recognized by serum from TiLV-infected fish. The immunization tests revealed that
serum antibodies levels in Nile tilapia produced by S5196-272 and S6200-317 were 
significantly increased (p-value < 0.05) at 7 days post-immunization (dpi)
compared to antibody levels on Day 0 (D0). All the results combined suggested a
potential vaccine candidate of S5 and S6 for TiLV protection in Nile tilapia.
