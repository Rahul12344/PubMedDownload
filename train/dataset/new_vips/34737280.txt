Phosphorothioate (PT) modification by the dnd gene cluster is the first
identified DNA backbone modification and constitute an epigenetic system with
multiple functions, including antioxidant ability, restriction modification, and 
virus resistance. Despite these advantages for hosting dnd systems, they are
surprisingly distributed sporadically among contemporary prokaryotic genomes. To 
address this ecological paradox, we systematically investigate the occurrence and
phylogeny of dnd systems, and they are suggested to have originated in ancient
Cyanobacteria after the Great Oxygenation Event. Interestingly, the occurrence of
dnd systems and prophages is significantly negatively correlated. Further, we
experimentally confirm that PT modification activates the filamentous phage SW1
by altering the binding affinity of repressor and the transcription level of its 
encoding gene. Competition assays, concurrent epigenomic and transcriptomic
sequencing subsequently show that PT modification affects the expression of a
variety of metabolic genes, which reduces the competitive fitness of the marine
bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3. Our findings strongly suggest that a
series of negative effects on microorganisms caused by dnd systems limit
horizontal gene transfer, thus leading to their sporadic distribution. Overall,
our study reveals putative evolutionary scenario of the dnd system and provides
novel insights into the physiological and ecological influences of PT
modification.
