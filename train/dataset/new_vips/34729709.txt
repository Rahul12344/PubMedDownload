Bovine vaccinia (BV) is an infectious disease caused by Vaccinia virus (VACV)
characterized by vesicular and exanthematic lesions, mainly in cattle. Although
BV has been described in some Brazilian regions in the last decades, official
information regarding the current prevalence in bovine herds of Midwestern Brazil
is lacking. Thus, the current study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence and risk
factors associated with BV in cattle in the Distrito Federal (DF), Brazil. Sera
of 312 cows of 64 herds were tested by virus-neutralizing test for VACV
antibodies. Herd and animal seroprevalence were estimated to be 33.3% (CI 95%:
18.2-48.3%) and 10.6% (CI 95%: 1.0-20.2%), respectively. Seropositive cows were
detected in dairy, beef, and mixed-purpose farms. The results of an
epidemiological questionnaire showed that no risk factor analyzed was positively 
associated with seropositivity to VACV. There was no significant association
between type of milking (manual/mechanic) and seropositivity to VACV; however,
most seropositive cows were present in farms with high daily milk production and 
high number of lactating and adult cows. Our results indicate that VACV
circulates in many regions of DF with considerable prevalence in dairy cows.
Control measures to restrict VACV circulation and consequences of the infection
may be advisable.
