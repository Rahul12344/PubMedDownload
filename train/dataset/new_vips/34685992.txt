Ubiquitous in citrus plants, Hesperidin and Hesperetin flavanones possess several
biological functions, including antiviral activity. Arbovirus infections pose an 
ever-increasing threat to global healthcare systems. Among the severe arboviral
infections currently known are those caused by members of the Flavivirus genus,
for example, Dengue Virus-DENV, Yellow Fever Virus-YFV, and West Nile Virus-WNV. 
In this study, we characterize the inhibitory effect of Hesperidin and Hesperetin
against DENV2, YFV, and WNV NS2B/NS3 proteases. We report the noncompetitive
inhibition of the NS2B/NS3pro by the two bioflavonoids with half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values <5 µM for HST and <70 µM for HSD. The
determined dissociation constants (KD) of both flavonoids is significantly below 
the threshold value of 30 µM. Our findings demonstrate that a new generation of
anti-flavivirus drugs could be developed based on selective optimization of both 
molecules.
