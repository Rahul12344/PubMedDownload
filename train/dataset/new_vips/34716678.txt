There is an unmet need for safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines that are stable and can be cost-effectively
produced at large scale. Here, a biopolymer particle (BP) vaccine technology that
can be quickly adapted to new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 is used.
Coronavirus antigen-coated BPs are described as vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The 
spike protein subunit S1 or epitopes from S and M proteins (SM) plus/minus the
nucleocapsid protein (N) are selected as antigens to either coat BPs during
assembly inside engineered Escherichia coli or BPs are engineered to specifically
ligate glycosylated spike protein (S1-ICC) produced by using baculovirus
expression in insect cell culture (ICC). BP vaccines are safe and immunogenic in 
mice. BP vaccines, SM-BP-N and S1-ICC-BP induced protective immunity in the
hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model as shown by reduction of virus titers up to
viral clearance in lungs post infection. The BP platform offers the possibility
for rapid design and cost-effective large-scale manufacture of ambient
temperature stable and globally available vaccines to combat the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
