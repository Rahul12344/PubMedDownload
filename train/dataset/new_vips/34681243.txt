Phage therapy is the use of bacterial viruses as antibacterial agents. A primary 
consideration for commercial development of phages for phage therapy is the
number of different bacterial strains that are successfully targeted, as this
defines the breadth of a phage cocktail's spectrum of activity. Alternatively,
phage cocktails may be used to reduce the potential for bacteria to evolve phage 
resistance. This, as we consider here, is in part a function of a cocktail's
'depth' of activity. Improved cocktail depth is achieved through inclusion of at 
least two phages able to infect a single bacterial strain, especially two phages 
against which bacterial mutation to cross resistance is relatively rare. Here, we
consider the breadth of activity of phage cocktails while taking both depth of
activity and bacterial mutation to cross resistance into account. This is done by
building on familiar algorithms normally used for determination solely of phage
cocktail breadth of activity. We show in particular how phage cocktails for phage
therapy may be rationally designed toward enhancing the number of bacteria
impacted while also reducing the potential for a subset of those bacteria to
evolve phage resistance, all as based on previously determined phage properties.
