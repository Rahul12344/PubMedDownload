Accumulating mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein can increase the
possibility of immune escape, challenging the present COVID-19 prophylaxis and
clinical interventions. Here, 3 receptor binding domain (RBD) specific monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs), 58G6, 510A5 and 13G9, with high neutralizing potency blocking 
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus display remarkable efficacy against authentic B.1.351 
virus. Surprisingly, structural analysis has revealed that 58G6 and 13G9 both
recognize the steric region S470-495 on the RBD, overlapping the E484K mutation
presented in B.1.351. Also, 58G6 directly binds to another region S450-458 in the
RBD. Significantly, 58G6 and 510A5 both demonstrate prophylactic efficacy against
authentic SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses in the transgenic mice expressing human 
ACE2 (hACE2), protecting weight loss and reducing virus loads. Together, we have 
evidenced 2 potent neutralizing Abs with unique mechanism targeting authentic
SARS-CoV-2 mutants, which can be promising candidates to fulfill the urgent needs
for the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.
