BACKGROUND: There have been over 30 million cases of COVID-19 in India and over
430,000 deaths. Transmission rates vary from region to region, and are influenced
by many factors including population susceptibility, travel and uptake of
preventive measures. To date there have been relatively few studies examining the
impact of the pandemic in lower income, rural regions of India. We report on a
study examining COVID-19 burden in a rural community in Tamil Nadu.
METHODS: The study was undertaken in a population of approximately 130,000
people, served by the Rural Unit of Health and Social Affairs (RUHSA), a
community health center of CMC, Vellore. We established and evaluated a COVID-19 
PCR-testing programme for symptomatic patients-testing was offered to 350
individuals, and household members of test-positive cases were offered antibody
testing. We also undertook two COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys in the same
community, amongst 701 randomly-selected individuals.
RESULTS: There were 182 positive tests in the symptomatic population (52.0%).
Factors associated with test-positivity were older age, male gender, higher
socioeconomic status (SES, as determined by occupation, education and housing), a
history of diabetes, contact with a confirmed/suspected case and attending a
gathering (such as a religious ceremony, festival or extended family gathering). 
Amongst test-positive cases, 3 (1.6%) died and 16 (8.8%) suffered a severe
illness. Amongst 129 household contacts 40 (31.0%) tested positive. The two
seroprevalence surveys showed positivity rates of 2.2% (July/Aug 2020) and 22.0% 
(Nov 2020). 40 tested positive (31.0%, 95% CI: 23.02 - 38.98). Our estimated
infection-to-case ratio was 31.7.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple approach using community health workers and a
community-based testing clinic can readily identify significant numbers of
COVID-19 infections in Indian rural population. There appear, however, to be low 
rates of death and severe illness, although vulnerable groups may be
under-represented in our sample. It's vital these lower income, rural populations
aren't overlooked in ongoing pandemic monitoring and vaccine roll-out in India.
