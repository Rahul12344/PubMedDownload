BACKGROUND: The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was withdrawn from the National
Immunization Program in 1993 because aseptic meningitis was reported as a
post-vaccination adverse reaction in Japan. This study aimed to measure the
uptake of and determinants influencing mumps vaccination, including concerns
about adverse reactions.
METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional survey for all parents whose children 
underwent 18-month health checkups in Kanazawa City between October 2019 and
February 2020. Community nurses interviewed the parents using a unified
questionnaire, and 1422 parents responded.
RESULTS: Based on records from maternal and child health handbooks, the mumps
vaccination rate was 55.6%. The most common reason for parents not vaccinating
their children against mumps was that "it is not a routine vaccine" (35.9%),
whereas "concern about adverse reactions" accounted for only 2.2%. In
multivariate analysis, the significantly positive factors associated with
vaccination against mumps were children whose parents knew that adverse reactions
were fever, rash, diarrhea, and vomiting; had received a recommendation for
vaccination from their family members; had read the Vaccination Guide issued by
the city; vaccinated with other voluntary vaccines or treated for
gastroenteritis; and had a deep general understanding of vaccination. Conversely,
the significantly negative factor was children whose parents had not received any
recommendation for vaccination.
CONCLUSION: The mumps vaccination rate could be improved by adding the mumps
vaccine in the routine vaccination program and educating parents by disseminating
correct information on mumps and the mumps vaccine, and by primary care
physicians routinely recommending vaccination.
