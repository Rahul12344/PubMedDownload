The interaction of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and chemotherapy may
result in worse outcomes. However, there may be more indirect effects of COVID.
We report 3 cases in which treatment was delayed because of COVID-related
inability or reluctance to travel. Oncology programs should consider such
indirect effects when devising treatments.
