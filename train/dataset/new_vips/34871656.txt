Previous studies showed that the water extract (PVW) from Spica of Prunella
vulgaris Linn. (Labiatae) exerts anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) activity.
Evaluation the antiviral activity of the graded ethanol precipitations indicated 
that 30% ethanol precipitate (PVE30) was the active principle of water extract
(PVW). Further activity-oriented separation of PVE30 through salting-out method
revealed that the anti-HSV activity of P. vulgaris glycoconjugates (PVG) was more
potent than PVE30 and PVW, 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS,
FT-IR and NMR techniques identified PVG as a type of
polyphenolic-protein-polysaccharides (PPPs) with an average molecular weight of
41.69 kDa. PVG was composed of dibenzylbutyrolactone lignan units, and rich in
galacturonic acid, xylose, rhamnose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose monosaccharide 
units, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Further in vitro antiviral testing
confirmed that PVG substantially and stably inhibited acyclovir (ACV) resistant
HSV strains; its inhibitory action was even better than the positive control ACV.
Overall, our findings support PVG as a potential drug resource for anti-HSV
therapy.
