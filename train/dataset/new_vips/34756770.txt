Emerging evidence suggest a possible association between immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) and some formulations of COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a retrospective
case series of ITP following vaccination with Vaxzevria ChadOx1-S (AstraZeneca)
and mRNA Comirnaty BNT162b2 COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines and compare the
incidence to expected background rates for Victoria during the first six months
of the Australian COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in 2021. Cases were identified by
reports to the Victorian state vaccine safety service, SAEFVIC, of individuals
aged 18 years or older presenting with thrombocytopenia following COVID-19
vaccination without evidence of thrombosis. Twenty-one confirmed or probable
cases of ITP were identified following receipt of AstraZeneca (n = 17) or
Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 4) vaccines. This translates to an observed incidence of 8
per million doses for AstraZeneca vaccine, twice the expected background rate of 
4.1 per million. The observed rate for Pfizer-BioNTech was consistent with the
expected background rate. The median time to onset for the cases post AstraZeneca
vaccination was 10 days (range 1-78) and median platelet nadir 5 × 109/L (range
0-67 × 109/L). Hospital presentations or admissions for management of symptoms
such as bleeding occurred in 18 (86%) of the cases. The majority of cases
(n = 11) required intervention with at least 2 therapy modalities. In conclusion,
we observed a substantially higher than expected rate of ITP following
AstraZeneca vaccination. ITP is the second haematological adverse event, distinct
from that of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), observed following 
AstraZeneca vaccination.
