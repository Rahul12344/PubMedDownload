Common reference methods for COVID-19 diagnosis include thermal cycling
amplification (e.g. RT-PCR) and isothermal amplification methods (e.g. LAMP and
RPA). However, they may not be suitable for direct detection in environmental and
biological samples due to background signal interference. Here, we report a rapid
and label-free interference reduction nucleic acid amplification strategy
(IR-NAAS) that exploits the advantages of luminescent iridium(III) probes,
time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) and multi-branch rolling circle
amplification (mbRCA). Using IR-NAAS, we established a luminescence approach for 
diagnosing COVID-19 RNAs sequences RdRp, ORF1ab and N with a linear range of
0.06-6.0 × 105 copies/mL and a detection limit of down to 7.3 × 104 copies/mL.
Moreover, the developed method was successfully applied to detect COVID-19 RNA
sequences from various environmental and biological samples, such as domestic
sewage, and mice urine, blood, feces, lung tissue, throat and nasal secretions.
Apart from COVID-19 diagnosis, IR-NAAS was also demonstrated for detecting other 
RNA viruses, such as H1N1 and CVA10, indicating that this approach has great
potential approach for routine preliminary viral detection.
