Understanding the diversity and circulation dynamics of seasonal influenza
viruses is key to public health decision-making. The limited genetic information 
of pre-pandemic seasonal IAVs in Chile has made it difficult to accurately
reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of these viruses within the country.
The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of
pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile. We sequenced the complete genome of 42
historic IAV obtained between 1996 and 2007. The phylogeny was determined using
HA sequences and complemented using other segments. Time-scale phylogenetic
analyses revealed that the diversity of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile
was influenced by continuous introductions of new A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 lineages and 
constant viral exchange between Chile and other countries every year. These
results provide important knowledge about genetic diversity and evolutionary
patterns of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile, which can help design
optimal surveillance systems and prevention strategies. However, future studies
with current sequences should be conducted.
