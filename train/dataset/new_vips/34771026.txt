Early diagnosis with rapid detection of the virus plays a key role in preventing 
the spread of infection and in treating patients effectively. In order to address
the need for a straightforward detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessment
of viral spread, we developed rapid, sensitive, extraction-free one-step reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse
transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) tests for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. We analyzed over 700 matched pairs of saliva and 
nasopharyngeal swab (NSB) specimens from asymptomatic and symptomatic
individuals. Saliva, as either an oral cavity swab or passive drool, was
collected in an RNA stabilization buffer. The stabilized saliva specimens were
heat-treated and directly analyzed without RNA extraction. The diagnostic
sensitivity of saliva-based RT-qPCR was at least 95% in individuals with
subclinical infection and outperformed RT-LAMP, which had at least 70%
sensitivity when compared to NSBs analyzed with a clinical RT-qPCR test. The
diagnostic sensitivity for passive drool saliva was higher than that of oral
cavity swab specimens (95% and 87%, respectively). A rapid, sensitive one-step
extraction-free RT-qPCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in passive drool saliva is 
operationally simple and can be easily implemented using existing testing sites, 
thus allowing high-throughput, rapid, and repeated testing of large populations. 
Furthermore, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals in an asymptomatic 
screening program and can help improve voluntary screening compliance for those
individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.
