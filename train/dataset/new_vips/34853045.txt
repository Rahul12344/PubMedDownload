We describe the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to our institution with
hypoxia and widespread pulmonary infiltrates managed initially as COVID-19 before
receiving a new diagnosis of HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with widespread
pulmonary and skeletal involvement. Initial differential diagnoses included
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, disseminated mycobacterial infection and
bacillary angiomatosis. A bone marrow biopsy showed heavy infiltration by spindle
cells, staining strongly positive for human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) and CD34,
suggesting symptomatic, disseminated KS as the unifying diagnosis. The patient
commenced cytotoxic therapy with weekly paclitaxel, with a clinical and
radiological response. To our knowledge, this case is among the most severe
described in the literature, which we discuss, along with how COVID-19 initially 
hindered developing a therapeutic allegiance with the patient.
