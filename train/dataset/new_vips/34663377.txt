BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) resides latently in cells of the myeloid
compartment, including CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and circulating
monocytes. Healthy hosts maintain the virus latently, and this infection is, for 
the most part, asymptomatic. However, given the proper external cues, HCMV
reactivates from latency, at which point the virus disseminates, causing disease.
The viral and cellular factors dictating the balance between these phases of
infection are incompletely understood, though a large body of literature support 
a role for viral-mediated manipulation of host cell signaling.
MAIN BODY: To establish and maintain latency, HCMV has evolved various means by
which it usurps host cell factors to alter the cellular environment to its own
advantage, including altering host cell signaling cascades. As early as virus
entry into myeloid cells, HCMV usurps cellular signaling to change the cellular
milieu, and this regulation includes upregulation, as well as downregulation, of 
different signaling cascades. Indeed, given proper reactivation cues, this
signaling is again altered to allow for transactivation of viral lytic genes.
CONCLUSIONS: HCMV modulation of host cell signaling is not binary, and many of
the cellular pathways altered are finely regulated, wherein the slightest
modification imparts profound changes to the cellular milieu. It is also evident 
that viral-mediated cell signaling differs not only between these phases of
infection, but also is myeloid cell type specific. Nonetheless, understanding the
exact pathways and the means by which HCMV mediates them will undoubtedly provide
novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
