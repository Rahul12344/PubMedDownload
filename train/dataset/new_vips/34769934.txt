Understanding of strategies to support individuals recovering from coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. 'Long COVID' is a multisystem disease
characterised by a range of respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
neurological, and musculoskeletal symptoms extending beyond 12 weeks. The aim of 
this study was to explore individuals' experiences of recovering from COVID-19 to
provide a better understanding of the acute and long-term impact of the disease
on physical activity (PA). Individualised semi-structured interviews were
conducted with 48 adults recovering from COVID-19 at 6-11 months post-infection. 
An inductive thematic analysis approach was used, reaching saturation at 14
interviews (10 female; 47 Â± 7 years). Four overarching themes were identified:
(i) Living with COVID-19, including managing activities of daily living; (ii)
Dealing with the Unknown and self-management strategies; (iii) Re-introducing
physical activity; and (iv) Challenges of returning to work. The return to PA,
whether through activities of daily living, work or exercise, is often associated
with the exacerbation of symptoms, presenting a range of challenges for
individuals recovering from COVID-19. Individually tailored support is therefore 
required to address the unique challenges posed by COVID-19.
