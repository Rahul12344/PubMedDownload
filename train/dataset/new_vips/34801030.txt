BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the practices and resilience of most
healthcare workers, including dieticians. In addition to offering critical care
to COVID-19 patients, dieticians play a major role in preventing and managing
conditions known to affect COVID-19, such as obesity and metabolic disorders. The
objective of this study was to examine the conditions and changes in the work
environment as well as resilience and its correlates among dieticians during the 
COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
METHODS: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted among dieticians
practicing in the UAE (n = 371), using a web-based questionnaire. The
questionnaire addressed, in addition to the sociodemographic information, the
practice-related characteristics and resilience of participants. For the latter
the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale© was used. Descriptive statistics as well as
simple and multiple linear regressions were used in the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of participants, 26.4% reported not having access to personal protective
equipment and 50% indicated being concerned for their safety and health.
Furthermore, considerable proportions of participants were not satisfied (45%)
with the support nor with the appreciation (37.7%) they received during the
pandemic. One in four dieticians considered quitting his/her job. While 65.8% of 
participants reported counseling COVID-19 patients, a third did not use any
online platform for counseling. The most cited challenge to dietetic practice
during the pandemic was 'maintaining work-life balance' (43.1%). The mean CD-RISC
score was 72.0 ± 14.0. After adjustment, working in a hospital or public clinic
(as opposed to private clinic), having a condition preventing face-to-face
counseling, considering quitting job and feeling neutral or dissatisfied with the
appreciation were associated with lower resilience scores, while counseling
COVID-19 patients was associated with higher scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fairly high resilience among dieticians practicing in
the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of this study highlighted a
few challenges, mainly related to safe practice environment, support for online
counseling, and maintaining work-life balance. Concerted efforts of policy and
decision makers ought to develop targeted programs for dieticians to ensure their
retention and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
