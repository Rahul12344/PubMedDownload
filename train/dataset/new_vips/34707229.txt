The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) mediates viral entry into the host cell.
Although the highly dynamic nature of Env intramolecular conformations has been
shown with single molecule spectroscopy in vitro, the bona fide Env intra- and
intermolecular mechanics when engaged with live T cells remains unknown. We used 
two photon fast fluorescence lifetime imaging detection of single-molecule
Förster Resonance Energy Transfer occurring between fluorescent labels on HIV-1
Env on native virions. Our observations reveal Env dynamics at two levels:
transitions between different intramolecular conformations and intermolecular
interactions between Env within the viral membrane. Furthermore, we show that
three broad neutralizing anti-Env antibodies directed to different epitopes
restrict Env intramolecular dynamics and interactions between adjacent Env
molecules when engaged with living T cells. Importantly, our results show that
Env-Env interactions depend on efficient virus maturation, and that is disrupted 
upon binding of Env to CD4 or by neutralizing antibodies. Thus, this study
illuminates how different intramolecular conformations and distribution of Env
molecules mediate HIV-1 Env-T cell interactions in real time and therefore might 
control immune evasion.
