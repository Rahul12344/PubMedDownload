BACKGROUND: To determine the exposure risk for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) during
neurology practice. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly
being recognized mandating high level of participation by neurologists.
METHODS: An American Academy of Neurology survey inquiring about various aspects 
of COVID-19 exposure was sent to a random sample of 800 active American Academy
of Neurology members who work in the United States. Use of second tier protection
(1 or more including sterile gloves, surgical gown, protective goggles/face
shield but not N95 mask) or maximum protection (N95 mask in addition to second
tier protection) during clinical encounter with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
patients was inquired.
RESULTS: Of the 81 respondents, 38% indicated exposure to COVID-19 at work, 1% at
home, and none outside of work/home. Of the 28 respondents who did experience at 
least 1 symptom of COVID-19, tiredness (32%) or diarrhea (8%) were reported. One 
respondent tested positive out of 12 (17%) of respondents who were tested for
COVID-19 within the last 2 weeks. One respondent received health care at an
emergency department/urgent care or was hospitalized related to COVID-19. When
seeing patients, maximum protection personal protective equipment was used either
always or most of the times by 16% of respondents in outpatient setting and 56%
of respondents in inpatient settings, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The data could enhance our knowledge of the factors that contribute 
to COVID-19 exposure during neurology practice in United States, and inform
education and advocacy efforts to neurology providers, trainees, and patients in 
this unprecedented pandemic.
