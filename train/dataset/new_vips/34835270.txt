Dengue is an important public health problem worldwide, with India contributing
nearly a third of global dengue disease burden. The measurement of neutralizing
antibody responses is critical for understanding dengue pathophysiology, vaccine 
development and evaluation. Historically, dengue virus neutralization titers were
measured using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs), which were later
adapted to focus reduction neutralization tests (FRNTs). Given the slow and
laborious nature of both these assays, there has been interest in adapting a
high-throughput flow cytometry based neutralization assay. However, flow
cytometry based assays typically underestimate neutralization titers, and in
situations where the titers are low they can even fail to detect neutralization
activity. In this study, by evaluating graded numbers of input Vero cell numbers 
and viral inoculum, we optimized the flow cytometry based neutralization assay in
such a way that it is sensitive and scores titers that are in concordance with
focus reduction neutralization tests for each of the four dengue virus serotypes 
(p < 0.0001). Given that dengue is a global public health concern, and several
research groups are making efforts to understand its pathophysiology and
accelerate vaccine development and evaluation both in India and worldwide, our
findings have timely significance for facilitating these efforts.
