COVID-19 messages vary around the world, and populations receive these messages
in different ways. Children are a vulnerable audience, especially in terms of
risk communication. As messages are being developed, communicated, and
disseminated about this pandemic, it is important to know the relation between
COVID-19 knowledge and concern among preadolescents. In Spring 2020, children (N=
4,249) from 8 global regions completed an online survey (Mage= 11.0, 54% female, 
46% male). We assessed children's COVID-19 knowledge by asking about prevention
and symptoms, as well as myths about the virus. We also assessed children's
concerns by asking about worries about self and others getting sick, missing
school, and interruption of activities. Our analyses revealed different relations
between knowledge and concern by region. Among children from Sub-Saharan Africa, 
the Arabian region, Asia, and North America, there was a positive relation
between knowledge and concern. For those from Latin America, Oceania, Europe, and
Southeast Asia, the relation was flat or negative. When producing messages for
children during a public health crisis, health communicators must know that more 
knowledge is not always associated with less concern.
