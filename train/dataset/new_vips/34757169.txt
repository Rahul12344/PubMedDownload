Potato virus X (PVX) is the type potexvirus of economic significance. The
pathogen is distributed worldwide, threatening solanaceous plants in particular. 
Based on the coat protein (CP) gene, PVX isolates are classified into two major
genotypes (I and II). To gain more insights into the molecular epidemiology and
evolution of PVX, recombination analyses were conducted and significant signals
were detected. Bayesian coalescent method was then applied to the time-stamped
entire CP sequences. According to the estimates, the global subtype I-1 went into
expansion in the 20th century and was evolving at a moderate rate. Based on the
CP phylogenies, a divergence scenario was proposed for PVX. Surveys of codon
usage variation showed that PVX genes had additional bias independent of
compositional constraint. In codon preference, PVX was both similar to and
different from the three major hosts, potato (Solanum tuberosum), tobacco
(Nicotiana tabacum), and tomato (S. lycopersicum). Moreover, the suppression of
CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies was observed in PVX.
