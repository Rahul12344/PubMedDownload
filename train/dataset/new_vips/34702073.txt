Canine distemper virus (CDV) and phocine distemper virus (PDV) are major
pathogens to terrestrial and marine mammals. Yet little is known about the timing
and geographical origin of distemper viruses and to what extent it was influenced
by environmental change and human activities. To address this, we (i) performed
the first comprehensive time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the two
distemper viruses, (ii) mapped distemper antibody and virus detection data from
marine mammals collected between 1972 and 2018, and (iii) compiled historical
reports on distemper dating back to the eighteenth century. We find that CDV and 
PDV diverged in the early seventeenth century. Modern CDV strains last shared a
common ancestor in the nineteenth century with a marked radiation during the
1930s-1950s. Modern PDV strains are of more recent origin, diverging in the
1970s-1980s. Based on the compiled information on distemper distribution, the
diverse host range of CDV and basal phylogenetic placement of terrestrial
morbilliviruses, we hypothesize a terrestrial CDV-like ancestor giving rise to
PDV in the North Atlantic. Moreover, given the estimated timing of distemper
origin and radiation, we hypothesize a prominent role of environmental change
such as the Little Ice Age, and human activities like globalization and war in
distemper virus evolution.
