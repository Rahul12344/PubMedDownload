BACKGROUND: High cure rates with licensed durations of therapy for chronic
hepatitis C virus suggest that many patients are overtreated. New strategies in
individuals who find it challenging to adhere to standard treatment courses could
significantly contribute to the elimination agenda.
OBJECTIVES: To compare cure rates using variable ultrashort first-line treatment 
stratified by baseline viral load followed by retreatment, with a fixed 8-week
first-line treatment with retreatment with or without adjunctive ribavirin.
DESIGN: An open-label, multicentre, factorial randomised controlled trial.
RANDOMISATION: Randomisation was computer generated, with patients allocated in a
1 : 1 ratio using a factorial design to each of biomarker-stratified variable
ultrashort strategy or fixed duration and adjunctive ribavirin (or not), using a 
minimisation algorithm with a probabilistic element.
SETTING: NHS.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 202 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) infected with chronic
hepatitis C virus genotype 1a/1b or 4 for ≥ 6 months, with a detectable plasma
hepatitis C viral load and no significant fibrosis [FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, 
France) score F0–F1 or biopsy-proven minimal fibrosis], a hepatitis C virus viral
load < 10,000,000 IU/ml, no previous exposure to direct-acting antiviral therapy 
for this infection and not pregnant. Patients co-infected with human
immunodeficiency virus were eligible if human immunodeficiency virus viral load
had been < 50 copies/ml for > 24 weeks on anti-human immunodeficiency virus
drugs.
INTERVENTIONS: Fixed-duration 8-week first-line therapy compared with variable
ultrashort first-line therapy, initially for 4–6 weeks (continuous scale)
stratified by screening viral load (variable ultrashort strategy 1, mean 32 days 
of treatment) and then, subsequently, for 4–7 weeks (variable ultrashort strategy
2 mean 39 days of duration), predominantly with ombitasvir, paritaprevir,
ritonavir (Viekirax®; AbbVie, Chicago, IL, USA), and dasabuvir (Exviera®; AbbVie,
Chicago, IL, USA) or ritonavir. All patients in whom first-line treatment was
unsuccessful were immediately retreated with 12 weeks’ sofosbuvir, ledipasvir
(Harvoni®, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and ribavirin.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was overall sustained virological
response (persistently undetectable) 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12).
RESULTS: A total of 202 patients were analysed. All patients in whom the primary 
outcome was evaluable achieved SVR12 overall [100% (197/197), 95% confidence
interval 86% to 100%], demonstrating non-inferiority between fixed- and
variable-duration strategies (difference 0%, 95% confidence interval –3.8% to
3.7%, prespecified non-inferiority margin 4%). A SVR12 following first-line
treatment was achieved in 91% (92/101; 95% confidence interval 86% to 97%) of
participants randomised to the fixed-duration strategy and by 48% (47/98; 95%
confidence interval 39% to 57%) allocated to the variable-duration strategy.
However, the proportion achieving SVR12 was significantly higher among those
allocated to variable ultrashort strategy 2 [72% (23/32), 95% confidence interval
56% to 87%] than among those allocated to variable ultrashort strategy 1 [36%
(24/66), 95% confidence interval 25% to 48%]. Overall, a SVR12 following
first-line treatment was achieved by 72% (70/101) (95% confidence interval 65% to
78%) of patients treated with ribavirin and by 68% (69/98) (95% confidence
interval 61% to 76%) of those not treated with ribavirin. A SVR12 with variable
ultrashort strategies 1 and 2 was 52% (25/48) (95% confidence interval 38% to
65%) with ribavirin, compared with 44% (22/50) (95% confidence interval 31% to
56) without. However, at treatment failure, the emergence of viral resistance was
lower with ribavirin [12% (3/26), 95% confidence interval 2% to 30%] than without
[38% (11/29), 95% confidence interval 21% to 58%; p = 0.01]. All 10 individuals
who became undetectable at day 3 of treatment achieved first-line SVR12
regardless of treatment duration. Five participants in the variable-duration arm 
and five in the fixed-duration arm experienced serious adverse events (p = 0.69),
as did five participants receiving ribavirin and five participants receiving no
ribavirin.
CONCLUSIONS: SVR12 rates were significantly higher when ultrashort treatment
varied between 4 and 7 weeks, rather than between 4 and 6 weeks. We found no
evidence of ribavirin significantly affecting first-line SVR12, with unsuccessful
first-line short-course therapy also not compromising subsequent retreatment with
sofosbuvir, ledipasvir and ribavirin.
FUTURE WORK: A priority for future work needs to be the development and
evaluation of robust predictive measures to identify those patients who can be
cured with ultrashort courses of therapy.
