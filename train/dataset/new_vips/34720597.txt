Introduction: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection has emerged as a
global health burden affecting nearly 292 million people. Tenofovir alafenamide
(TAF) is an effective treatment for CHB patients. However, the detailed mechanism
underlying the antiviral activity of TAF remains unclear.
Methods: In this study, we investigated the antiviral effect of exosomes derived 
from the serum of CHB patients treated with TAF (Exo-serum) and TAF-treated
macrophages (MP) (Exo-MP(TAF)).
Results: RNAseq analysis was also performed to determine the associated long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The results demonstrated that both Exo-serum and
Exo-MP(TAF) could be taken up by HepAD38 cells and exhibited potent antiviral
activities, as manifested by significantly downregulating the levels of hepatitis
B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, HBV DNA, and covalently closed circular
DNA. The antiviral effect of Exo-serum was more potent than those of TAF
treatment alone. RNAseq analysis revealed that lncRNA HOTTIP was upregulated
significantly in Exo-serum. Further, lncRNA HOTTIP knockdown reversed the
antiviral effect of Exo-MP(TAF) on HepAD38 cells, whereas lncRNA HOTTIP knockdown
exerted the opposite roles.
Discussion: Taken together, these results suggest that exosomal lncRNA HOTTIP is 
essential for the antiviral activity of TAF and provide a novel understanding of 
the exosome-mediated mechanism underlying HBV infection.
