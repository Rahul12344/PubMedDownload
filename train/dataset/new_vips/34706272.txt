Anti-viral monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments may provide immediate but
short-term immunity from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk
populations, such as people with diabetes and the elderly; however, data on their
efficacy in these populations are limited. We demonstrate that prophylactic mAb
treatment blocks viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts
in aged, type 2 diabetic rhesus macaques. mAb infusion dramatically curtails
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated stimulation
of interferon-induced chemokines and T cell activation, significantly reducing
development of interstitial pneumonia. Furthermore, mAb infusion significantly
dampens the greater than 3-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2-induced effector CD4
T cell influx into the cerebrospinal fluid. Our data show that neutralizing mAbs 
administered preventatively to high-risk populations may mitigate the adverse
inflammatory consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
