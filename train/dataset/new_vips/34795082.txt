Generating evidence based on real-world data is gaining importance in research
not least since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Common Data Model of Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a research infrastructure that implements 
FAIR principles. Although the transfer of German claim data to OMOP is already
implemented, drug data is an open issue. This paper provides a concept to prepare
electronic health record (EHR) drug data for the transfer to OMOP based on
requirements analysis and descriptive statistics for profiling EHR data developed
by an interdisciplinary team and also covers data quality issues. The concept not
only ensures FAIR principles for research, but provides the foundation for German
drug data to OMOP transfer.
