Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) (ISG15) is a
ubiquitin-like modifier induced during infections and involved in host defense
mechanisms. Not surprisingly, many viruses encode deISGylating activities to
antagonize its effect. Here we show that infection by Zika, SARS-CoV-2 and
influenza viruses induce ISG15-modifying enzymes. While influenza and Zika
viruses induce ISGylation, SARS-CoV-2 triggers deISGylation instead to generate
free ISG15. The ratio of free versus conjugated ISG15 driven by the papain-like
protease (PLpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 correlates with macrophage polarization
toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and attenuated antigen presentation. In vitro
characterization of purified wild-type and mutant PLpro revealed its strong
deISGylating over deubiquitylating activity. Quantitative proteomic analyses of
PLpro substrates and secretome from SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages revealed
several glycolytic enzymes previously implicated in the expression of
inflammatory genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Collectively,
our results indicate that altered free versus conjugated ISG15 dysregulates
macrophage responses and probably contributes to the cytokine storms triggered by
SARS-CoV-2.
