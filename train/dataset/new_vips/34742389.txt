Plants become a promising biofactory for the large-scale production of
recombinant proteins due to low cost, scalability, and safety. Agroinfiltration
of plant leaves with a plant viral vector carrying a gene of interest is a rapid 
and efficient method for protein production in plants. Currently this method is
in use for producing a wide range of proteins for multiple applications,
including vaccine antigens, antibodies, and protein nanoparticles such as
virus-like particles. A number of pharmaceutical proteins produced by transient
expression are currently in clinical development. Here, we describe potato virus 
X based vector pEff-GFP enabling fast and high-level expression of recombinant
proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The pEff vector provides green
fluorescent protein expression levels of up to 30% of total soluble protein
(about 1mg per g of fresh leaf tissue) and was successfully applied for the
production of the immunogens of potential clinical interest.
