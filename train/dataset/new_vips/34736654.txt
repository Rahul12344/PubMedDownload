Herein, we show differences in blood serum of asymptomatic and symptomatic
pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and correlate them with laboratory indexes,
ATR FTIR and multivariate machine learning methods. We collected the sera of
COVID-19 diagnosed pregnant women, in the second trimester (n = 12),
third-trimester (n = 7), and second-trimester with severe symptoms (n = 7)
compared to the healthy pregnant (n = 11) women, which makes a total of 37
participants. To assign the accuracy of FTIR spectra regions where peak shifts
occurred, the Random Forest algorithm, traditional C5.0 single decision tree
algorithm and deep neural network approach were used. We verified the
correspondence between the FTIR results and the laboratory indexes such as: the
count of peripheral blood cells, biochemical parameters, and coagulation
indicators of pregnant women. CH2 scissoring, amide II, amide I vibrations could 
be used to differentiate the groups. The accuracy calculated by machine learning 
methods was higher than 90%. We also developed a method based on the dynamics of 
the absorbance spectra allowing to determine the differences between the spectra 
of healthy and COVID-19 patients. Laboratory indexes of biochemical parameters
associated with COVID-19 validate changes in the total amount of proteins,
albumin and lipase.
