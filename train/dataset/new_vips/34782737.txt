A harmonized balance between positive and negative regulation of pattern
recognition receptor (PRR)-initiated immune responses is required to achieve the 
most favorable outcome for the host. This balance is crucial because it must not 
only ensure activation of the first line of defense against viral infection but
also prevent inappropriate immune activation, which results in autoimmune
diseases. Recent studies have shown how signal transduction pathways initiated by
PRRs are positively and negatively regulated by diverse modulators to maintain
host immune homeostasis. However, viruses have developed strategies to subvert
the host antiviral response and establish infection. Viruses have evolved
numerous genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins that antagonize the host immune
system. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge regarding key host 
factors that regulate innate immune signaling molecules upon viral infection and 
discusses evidence showing how specific viral proteins counteract antiviral
responses via immunomodulatory strategies.
