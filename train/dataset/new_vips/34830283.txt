RAS (rat sarcoma virus) mutant cancers remain difficult to treat despite the
advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Targeted therapies against the
components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including RAS,
RAF, MEK, and ERK, have demonstrated activity in BRAF mutant and, in limited
cases, RAS mutant cancer. RAS mutant cancers have been found to activate adaptive
resistance mechanisms such as autophagy during MAPK inhibition. Here, we review
the recent clinically relevant advances in the development of the MAPK pathway
and autophagy inhibitors and focus on their application to RAS mutant cancers. We
provide analysis of the preclinical rationale for combining the MAPK pathway and 
autophagy and highlight the most recent clinical trials that have been launched
to capitalize on this potentially synthetic lethal approach to cancer therapy.
