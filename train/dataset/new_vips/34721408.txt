Children have reduced severity of COVID-19 compared to adults and typically have 
mild or asymptomatic disease. The immunological mechanisms underlying these
age-related differences in clinical outcomes remain unexplained. Here, we
quantify 23 immune cell populations in 141 samples from children and adults with 
mild COVID-19 and their PCR-negative close household contacts at acute and
convalescent time points. Children with COVID-19 displayed marked reductions in
myeloid cells during infection, most prominent in children under the age of five.
Recovery from infection in both children and adults was characterised by the
generation of CD8 TCM and CD4 TCM up to 9 weeks post infection.
SARS-CoV-2-exposed close contacts also had immunological changes over time
despite no evidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR testing. This
included an increase in low-density neutrophils during convalescence in both
exposed children and adults, as well as increases in CD8 TCM and CD4 TCM in
exposed adults. In comparison to children with other common respiratory viral
infections, those with COVID-19 had a greater change in innate and T
cell-mediated immune responses over time. These findings provide new mechanistic 
insights into the immune response during and after recovery from COVID-19 in both
children and adults.
