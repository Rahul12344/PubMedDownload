BACKGROUND: School closures and family economic instability caused by the
COVID-19 lockdown measures have threatened the mental health and academic
progress of adolescents. Through secondary data analysis of World Vision Asia
Pacific Region's COVID-19 response-assessments in May-June 2020, this study
examined whether adolescents' study, physical, and leisure activities,
psychosocial status, and sources of COVID-19 information differed by gender.
METHODS: The assessments used cross-sectional surveys of adolescents in poor
communities served by World Vision (n = 5552 males and n = 6680 females) aged
10-18 years old in six countries. The study households of adolescents were
selected either by random sampling or non-probability convenience sampling and
assessed using telephone or in-person interviews. Multivariate logistic
regression analyses examined the relationship between gender and psychosocial
status; daily activities (e.g., play, study); and sources of information about
COVID-19.
RESULTS: Participation in remote education was low (range: 0.5-20.7% across
countries), with gender difference found only in Vietnam. Compared to males,
female adolescents were less likely to play physically with a range of AOR:
0.36-0.55 (n = 5 countries) or play video games with a range of AOR: 0.55-0.72
(n = 2 countries). Female adolescents were more likely to feel isolated or
stressed (India, AOR = 1.13, 95%CI:1.00, 1.26); feel unsafe (the Philippines,
AOR = 2.22, 95%CI:1.14, 4.33; Vietnam, AOR = 1.31, 95%CI:1.03, 1.47); be
concerned about education (India, AOR = 1.24, 95%CI:1.09, 1.41; Myanmar,
AOR = 1.59, 95%CI:1.05, 2.40); or be concerned about household income (India,
AOR = 1.13, 95%CI:1.00, 1.28; Vietnam, AOR = 1.31, 95%CI:1.09, 1.58). Female
adolescents were also less likely to obtain COVID-19 related information through 
internet/social media (Bangladesh, AOR = 0.51, 95%CI:0.41, 0.64; India,
AOR = 0.84, 95%CI:0.73, 0.96; and Myanmar, AOR = 0.65, 95%CI:0.43, 0.97) and
mobile call or short message (India, AOR = 0.88, 95%CI:0.80, 0.98) but more
likely to get the information from friends (Vietnam, AOR = 1.18, 95%CI:1.02,
1.36) and family (Bangladesh, AOR = 1.44, 95% CI:1.21, 1.70; India, AOR = 1.29,
95% CI:1.15, 1.45).
CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of gender differences in the impacts of COVID-19 on
adolescents' schooling, physical, and mental health can inform adolescent
protection interventions. Psychosocial support during response and recovery
phases needs to pay special attention to gender differences, since female
adolescents' psychosocial status is at higher risk when facing the challenges of 
this pandemic.
