Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant health burden and leading cause of
virus-induced cancers. However, studies have been hampered due to restricted
tropism that makes production and purification of high titer virus problematic.
This issue has been overcome by developing alternative HPV production methods
such as virus-like particles (VLPs), which are devoid of a native viral genome.
Structural studies have been limited in resolution due to the heterogeneity,
fragility, and stability of the VLP capsids. The mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1)
presented here has provided the opportunity to study a native papillomavirus in
the context of a common laboratory animal. Using cryo EM to solve the structure
of MmuPV1, we achieved 3.3 Ã… resolution with a local symmetry refinement method
that defined smaller, symmetry related subparticles. The resulting
high-resolution structure allowed us to build the MmuPV1 asymmetric unit for the 
first time and identify putative L2 density. We also used our program ISECC to
quantify capsid flexibility, which revealed that capsomers move as rigid bodies
connected by flexible linkers. The MmuPV1 flexibility was comparable to that of a
HPV VLP previously characterized. The resulting MmuPV1 structure is a promising
step forward in the study of papillomavirus and will provide a framework for
continuing biochemical, genetic, and biophysical research for papillomaviruses.
