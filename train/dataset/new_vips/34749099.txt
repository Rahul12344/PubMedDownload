Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a deadly pathogen that still plagues
suckling piglets. However, there is still no anti-PEDV drug available in clinics.
To develop potential anti-PEDV drugs, the antiviral activity of Alpiniae
oxyphyllae fructus polysaccharide 3 (AOFP3) against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2
cells were assessed in our present study. The structural characterization of
AOFP3 was studied by using HPAEC, GC-MS, FT-IR and NMR techniques. At the same
time, the anti-PEDV activity of AOFP3 was investigated by performing RT-qPCR,
Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. The results showed that AOFP3
(44.4 kDa) was composed of glucose and galacturonic acid at a molar ratio of
77.54:22.46 and consisted of →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→,
T-α-D-Glcp-(1→ and →4)-α-D-GalAp-(1→. AOFP3 significantly decreased PEDV titer in
IPEC-J2 cells and prevented cellular damage of IPEC-J2 cells caused by PEDV
infection. Furthermore, AOFP3 showed an antioxidative activity in inhibiting PEDV
reproduction. Therefore, AOFP3 was expected to be a material of anti-PEDV drug.
