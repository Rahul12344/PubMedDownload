Female reproductive tract infections (FRTIs) have a huge impact on women's health
including their reproductive health in rural areas. Immunomodulation by helminth 
infections could influence the occurrence of FRTIs. This study aimed to
investigate the association between FRTIs, hookworm infections, and
sociodemographic factors in six rural areas of the central region of Togo. A
semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographical information,
and parasitological assessments were used to diagnose helminth infections.
Moreover, cytobacteriological examination of vaginal swabs was performed for the 
diagnosis of candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis (BV), and real-time PCR method
was used to determine sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Finally, a logistic
regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship and association of
these factors to FRTIs. The prevalence of FRTIs was 82.3% including STIs
(74.38%), BV (31.79%), and vulvovaginal candidiasis (9.85%). In detail, FRTIs
were caused by bacteria such as Ureaplasma parvum (50%), Ureaplasma urealyticum
(26.5%), and Mycoplasma hominis (17.5%) and viruses such us cytomegalovirus (5%) 
and human papilloma virus (HPV) (20%). No cases of Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema
pallidum, or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were observed. Interestingly, women who
had hookworm infections were at high risk of HPV. The use of condoms was a
protective factor [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.23; 95% CI [0.11-0.51)], while
the use of contraceptive methods was a risk factor [aOR = 2.49; 95% CI
(1.19-5.19)] for STIs. The risk of BV was lower among participants who had more
than four pregnancies [aOR = 0.27; 95% CI (0.11-0.65)]. Furthermore, women who
had ever been paid for sexual intercourse were at high probability risk of
vulvovaginal candidiasis [aOR = 16.92; 95% CI (1.46-196.48)]. This study
highlighted risk factors associated with FRTIs, the control of which would help
to reduce the incidence of these diseases. Health-care professionals could
develop education and sensitization strategies based on these risk factors, and
anti-hookworm treatment concepts may be taken into consideration to minimize the 
risk of HPV infections.
