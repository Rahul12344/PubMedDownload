Every year, Agroscope examines nearly 300,000 tubers for the presence of viruses,
as regulated for the certification of seed potatoes intended for Swiss growers.
Since 2016, this examination has been performed via RT-qPCR on dormant tubers
directly after harvest. This method offers fast results and eliminates the need
for the use of Rindite, which is a toxic and polluting gaseous compound
previously used in Switzerland to break the dormancy of seed tubers. The
implementation of this molecular analytical method for the routine diagnosis of
regulated viruses makes it possible to conduct additional analyses via Illumina
sequencing to assess the conformity of the primers and probes used with the
sequences of the different viral isolates. This form of quality control in
routine diagnosis is a source of information that can answer more fundamental
scientific questions related to the epidemiology of viral strains related to
certification. The datasets produced in this framework can also be used to
explore the diversity of rare or unknown virus species in potato
crops.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary
