Background: Highlighted by the current opioid epidemic, identifying novel
therapies to treat chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain is a critical need. To
develop these treatments, it is necessary to have viable targets in the brain to 
act on. Historically, neural tracing studies have been extremely useful in
determining connections between brain areas but do not provide information about 
the functionality of these connections. Combining optogenetics and behavioral
observation allows researchers to determine whether a particular brain area is
involved in the regulation of such behavior. The addition of multi-channel
electrophysiological recording provides information on real-time neuronal
activity in the specific neuronal pathway.
Methods: Male C57/BL/6J mice (8-week-old) underwent either chronic constriction
injury of infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION) or a sham surgery and were injected with
either channelrhodopsin (ChR2) or a control virus in the hypothalamic A11
nucleus. Two weeks after CCI-ION, they were tested in real-time place preference 
(RTPP), while neuronal activity in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) 
was recorded.
Results: Optogenetic excitation of the A11 neurons results in more time spent in 
the stimulation chamber during RTPP testing. Additionally, stimulation of the A11
results in a greater number of neuronal activity increase in the Sp5C in animals 
with the injection of AAV carrying ChR2 compared to animals injected with a
control virus or that underwent a sham surgery.
Conclusion: In vivo multi-channel electrophysiological recording, optogenetic
stimulation, and behavioral observation can be combined in a mouse model of
chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain to validate brain areas involved in the
modulation of such pain.
