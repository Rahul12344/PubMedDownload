Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and its infection may cause
severe neurodegenerative diseases. The outbreak of ZIKV in 2015 in South America 
has caused severe human congenital and neurologic disorders. Thus, it is vitally 
important to determine the inner mechanism of ZIKV infection. Here, our data
suggested that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 38 (USP38) played an important
role in host resistance to ZIKV infection, during which ZIKV infection did not
affect USP38 expression. Mechanistically, USP38 bound to the ZIKV envelope (E)
protein through its C-terminal domain and attenuated its K48-linked and
K63-linked polyubiquitination, thereby repressed the infection of ZIKV. In
addition, we found that the deubiquitinase activity of USP38 was essential to
inhibit ZIKV infection, and the mutant that lacked the deubiquitinase activity of
USP38 lost the ability to inhibit infection. In conclusion, we found a novel host
protein USP38 against ZIKV infection, and this may represent a potential
therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection.
