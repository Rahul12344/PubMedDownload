Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can progress to severe pneumonia with
respiratory failure and is aggravated by the deregulation of the immune system
causing an excessive inflammation including the cytokine storm. Since 2019,
several studies regarding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and COVID-19 
infections is increasing all over the world. In addition, thanks to new
scientific findings, we actually know better why certain conditions are
considered a higher risk in both situations. There are instances when having an
autoimmune disease increases susceptibility to COVID-19 complications, such as
when autoantibodies capable of neutralizing type I IFN are present, and other
situations in which having COVID-19 infection precedes the appearance of various 
autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, including multisystem inflammatory
syndrome in children (MIS-C), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia (AIHA), thus, adding to the growing mystery surrounding the SARS-CoV-2
virus and raising questions about the nature of its link with autoimmune and
autoinflammatory sequelae. Herein, we discuss the role of host and virus genetics
and some possible immunological mechanisms that might lead to the disease
aggravation.
