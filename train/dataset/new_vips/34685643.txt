Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as novel mediators of
intercellular communication. They work via delivering the sequestered cargo to
cells in the close vicinity, as well as distant sites in the body, regulating
pathophysiological processes. Cell death and inflammation are biologically
crucial processes in both normal physiology and pathology. These processes are
indistinguishably linked with their effectors modulating the other process. For
instance, during an unresolvable infection, the upregulation of specific immune
mediators leads to inflammation causing cell death and tissue damage. EVs have
gained considerable interest as mediators of both cell death and inflammation
during conditions, such as sepsis. This review summarizes the types of
extracellular vesicles known to date and their roles in mediating immune
responses leading to cell death and inflammation with specific focus on sepsis
and lung inflammation.
