The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires the continued
development of safe, long-lasting, and efficacious vaccines for preventive
responses to major outbreaks around the world, and especially in isolated and
developing countries. To combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), we characterize a temperature-stable vaccine candidate (TOH-Vac1)
that uses a replication-competent, attenuated vaccinia virus as a vector to
express a membrane-tethered spike receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen. We
evaluate the effects of dose escalation and administration routes on vaccine
safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity in animal models. Our vaccine induces high
levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and favorable T cell responses,
while maintaining an optimal safety profile in mice and cynomolgus macaques. We
demonstrate robust immune responses and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2
variants after only a single dose. Together, these findings support further
development of our novel and versatile vaccine platform as an alternative or
complementary approach to current vaccines.
