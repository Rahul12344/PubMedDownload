Arglabin (l(R),10(S)-epoxy-5(S),5(S),7(S)-guaia-3(4),ll(13)-dien-6,12-olide), is 
a natural sesquiterpene γ-lactone which was first isolated from Artemisia
glabella. The compound has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity
through inhibition of the NLR Family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome and production of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin
(IL)-1β and IL-18. A more hydrophilic derivative of the compound also exhibited
antitumor activity in the breast, colon, ovarian, and lung cancer. Some other
synthetic derivatives of the compound have also been synthesized with antitumor, 
cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Since both NLRP3
inflammasome and cytokine storm are associated with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 
and its lethality, compounds like arglabin might have therapeutic potential to
attenuate the inflammasome-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or the
cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.
