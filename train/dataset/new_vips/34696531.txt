Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes transient acute infection, and little is known of 
viral shedding via the duodenum and into the intestinal environment, including
the gut microbiome, from the period of infection until after the recovery of
symptoms. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to comprehensively observe the
amount of virus excreted into the intestinal tract, the changes in the intestinal
microbiome, and the level of inflammation during the healing process. We used
blood and stool specimens from patients with human immunodeficiency virus who
were infected with HAV during the HAV outbreak in Japan in 2018. Moreover, we
observed changes in fecal HAV RNA and quantified the plasma cytokine level and
gut microbiome by 16S rRNA analysis from clinical onset to at least 6 months
after healing. HAV was detected from clinical onset up to a period of more than
150 days. Immediately after infection, many pro-inflammatory cytokines were
elicited, and some cytokines showed different behaviors. The intestinal
microbiome changed significantly after infection (dysbiosis), and the dysbiosis
continued for a long time after healing. These observations suggest that the
immunocompromised state is associated with prolonged viral shedding into the
intestinal tract and delayed recovery of the intestinal environment.
