In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 spread
rapidly worldwide. Portable nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 are critically
important for diagnostics. In this study, we used an isothermal amplification
method-Multienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification (MIRA)-for rapid detection of
SARS-CoV-2. We designed the primers and probes in ORF1ab and N gene of
SARS-CoV-2. The amplicons could be monitored by lateral flow dipsticks (LFDs).
The reaction temperature, time, concentrations of primers and probes, and working
volume were optimized. Four commercial swab collection buffers were used to test 
the amplification efficacy of our assay without RNA extraction. Our assay was
able to amplify duplex targets of SARS-CoV-2 in one single reaction using
one-step RT-MIRA. The assay worked well in a low volume of 10 μl at 38°C for 20
min. Using three collection buffers without guanidinium, our assay was able to
amplify efficaciously without RNA extraction. The 95% limit of detection (LoD) of
the RT-MIRA assay was 49.5 (95% CI, 46.8-52.7) copies/ml for ORF1ab gene and 48.8
(95% CI, 46.5-52.6) copies/ml for N gene. There is no cross-reaction with other
human respiratory pathogens, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza A virus,
influenza B virus, human adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human
parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus 229E in our assay. The precision evaluation 
revealed that the C50-20% to C50+20% range bounds the C5-C95 interval. This assay
also showed high anti-interference ability. The extraction-free RT-MIRA and qPCR 
detection results of 243 nucleic acid specimens from suspected patients or
national references showed a 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 94.2%-100.0%)
positive predictive value and a 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 92.7%-100.0%)
negative predictive value. Compared with qPCR, the kappa value of the two assays 
was 1.00 (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, we provide a portable and visualized method
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 without RNA extraction, allowing its application in
SARS-CoV-2 on-site detection.
