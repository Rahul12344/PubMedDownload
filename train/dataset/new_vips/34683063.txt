BACKGROUND: When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most Chinese university 
students were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus, considering
the great impact of the lockdown on young people habits and their psychological
well-being. This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and its associated factors among Chinese university students who are
isolated at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: 4520 participants from five universities in China were surveyed by online
questionnaire and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) was adopted as a
screening instrument.
RESULTS: Exposure to virus was significantly related to PTSD outcomes. The most
important predictors for PTSD outcomes were parents' relationship and the way
parents educated, and university-provided psychological counseling was a
protective factor against developing PTSD.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had adverse psychological consequences on
Chinese university students who were isolated at home due to the relatively high 
prevalence rate of PTSD which was reported. Adverse parental relationships and
the extreme way parents educate their children could be the major risk factors
for PTSD outcomes. Psychological interventions need to be made available to
home-quarantined university students, and those in the worst-hit and exposed
areas to virus should be given priority focus.
