BACKGROUND: The impact of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and other
lifestyle-related factors on severe COVID-19 risk is understudied. The present
study aims to investigate lifestyle-related and socioeconomic factors as possible
predictors of COVID-19, with special focus on CRF, and to further study whether
these factors may attenuate obesity- and hypertension-related risks, as well as
mediate associations between socioeconomic factors and severe COVID-19 risk.
METHODS: Out of initially 407,131 participants who participated in nationwide
occupational health service screening between 1992 and 2020, n = 857 cases (70%
men, mean age 49.9 years) of severe COVID-19 were identified. CRF was estimated
using a sub-maximum cycle test, and other lifestyle variables were self-reported.
Analyses were performed including both unmatched, n = 278,598, and sex-and
age-matched, n = 3426, controls. Severe COVID-19 included hospitalization,
intensive care or death due to COVID-19.
RESULTS: Patients with more severe COVID-19 had significantly lower CRF, higher
BMI, a greater presence of comorbidities and were more often daily smokers. In
matched analyses, there was a graded decrease in odds for severe COVID-19 with
each ml in CRF (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.970 to 0.998), and a two-fold increase in
odds between the lowest and highest (< 32 vs. ≥ 46 ml·min-1·kg-1) CRF group.
Higher BMI (per unit increase, OR = 1.09, 1.06 to 1.12), larger waist
circumference (per cm, OR = 1.04, 1.02 to 1.06), daily smoking (OR = 0.60, 0.41
to 0.89) and high overall stress (OR = 1.36, 1.001 to 1.84) also remained
significantly associated with severe COVID-19 risk. Obesity- and blood
pressure-related risks were attenuated by adjustment for CRF and lifestyle
variables. Mediation through CRF, BMI and smoking accounted for 9% to 54% of the 
associations between low education, low income and blue collar/low skilled
occupations and severe COVID-19 risk. The results were consistent using either
matched or unmatched controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Both lifestyle-related and socioeconomic factors were associated
with risk of severe COVID-19. However, higher CRF attenuated the risk associated 
with obesity and high blood pressure, and mediated the risk associated with
various socioeconomic factors. This emphasises the importance of interventions to
maintain or increase CRF in the general population to strengthen the resilience
to severe COVID-19, especially in high-risk individuals.
