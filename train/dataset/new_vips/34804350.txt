Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is characterized by cutaneous lesions that are often papular 
and present variably depending on the stage of progression. We describe a patient
with a fibroma-like nodule, a lesion not commonly associated with KS. Previously 
observed in lymphedematous human immunodeficiency virus-associated KS, the
occurrence of this nodule in the absence of chronic lymphedema suggests an
alternative etiology.
