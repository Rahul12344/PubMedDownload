Although reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR remains the gold standard to
perform viral detection, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) is already used to perform diagnosis of various
infections. This work reports the results of a multicentric study performed in
Sicily to evaluate the diagnostic power of an RT-LAMP kit for the diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection on a total of 551 samples collected in January and February 
2021, revealing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative
predictive values ≥95%. Our results suggest the potential employment of this kit 
as a screening test to be used where fast and reliable results are demanded
without the need for expensive instruments and highly-skilled personnel.
