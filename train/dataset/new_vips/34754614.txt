Background and Objective: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed human
immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection from a death sentence to a chronic
syndrome, allowing infected individuals to lead near-normal lives, including
achieving pregnancy and bearing children. Notwithstanding, concerns remain about 
the effects of ART in pregnancy. Previous studies suggested contradictory
associations between ART and pregnancy. This study determined birth outcomes in
pregnant women who accessed ART between 2004 and 2017 at a major tertiary
hospital in North Central Nigeria.
Methods: This was a retrospective study of 5,080 participants. Ethical clearance 
was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Harvard T. H. Chan School
of Public Health Boston. A pro forma for data abstraction was designed and used
to collect data. Abstracted data were sorted and managed using SPSS® version 22. 
The Chi-square test was used to calculate the proportions of pregnancy outcomes. 
One-way analysis of variance was used to test the effect of antiretroviral drug
regimens on mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery. All levels of
significance were set at p 0.05.
Results: Pregnancy outcomes were recorded as live birth (99.8%), stillbirth
(0.2%), preterm delivery (6.6%), and low birth weight (23%). There was a
statistically significant association between ART in pregnancy and low birth
weight {χ2 [(5, n = 3439) = 11.99, p = 0.04]}. The highest mean birth weights
were recorded in participants who received drug combinations with protease
inhibitors or efavirenz, in contrast to participants who received Nevirapine,
stavudine and Emtricitabine/Tenofovirbased regimens. However, there was no
significant difference in the gestational age of babies at birth for the six ART 
regimens in the study.
Conclusion and Global Health Implications: Findings support the benefits of ART
in pregnancy, which is in line with the testing and treatment policies of the
90-90-90 targets for ending HIV by the year 2030.
