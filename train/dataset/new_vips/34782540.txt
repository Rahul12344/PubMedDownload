Background & objectives: Since the bacterium, Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) has
acquired resistance to almost all commercially available antibiotics, the search 
for alternative treatment options continues to be need of the hour. Bacteriophage
therapy seems to be the most promising amongst various proposed alternatives
(e.g. antimicrobial peptides, bacteriocin, probiotics, etc.). The present study, 
therefore, aimed to evaluate the effect of different dosages of specific phages
in immunocompromised rodents in a septicaemia model caused by AB mimicking real
clinical situations.
Methods: The three most active and unique phages (ɸAb4, ɸAb7 and ɸAb14) were
selected for this study. A constant dose (100 μl of 108 pfu/ml) of AB was given
in all the experiments. Five different sets of experiments were designed:
prophylactic administration of phage cocktail in the volume of 100 μl (109
pfu/ml) before and simultaneous with the bacterial challenge; and therapeutic
i.e. administration of phage cocktail six, 12 and 24 h after bacterial challenge.
Since there were deaths in mice when phage was given 24 h after bacterial
challenge, the reduced dosage i.e. 100 μl of 107, 10[6], 105 pfu/ml of phage
cocktail was also evaluated.
Results: The administration of 100 μl (109 pfu/ml) of phage cocktail after six,
12 and 24 h of the bacterial challenge resulted in the mortality ranging between 
20 to 60 per cent. However, no mortality could be observed with simultaneous or
prophylactic administration of phages with the bacterial challenge. No mortality 
was observed with reduced doses of the cocktail (10[6] and10[5] pfu/ml).
Interpretation & conclusions: As per the results of this study, it may be
concluded that even if patients with acute infections report late to the
hospital, a relatively low dose of the phage cocktail may be therapeutically
beneficial.
