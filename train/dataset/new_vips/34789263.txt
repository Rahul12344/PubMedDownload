BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains one of the most dreadful female malignancies
globally, in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial functions. Circular RNAs
have drawn great attention in cancer research area and propofol is a widely
applied intravenous anesthetic agent.
METHODS: In the current study, we explored the function of circular RNA nucleolar
and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (circNOLC1) in CSCs of breast cancer and the
inhibitory impact of propofol on circNOLC1.
RESULTS: The expression of circNOLC1 was induced in breast cancer tissues
compared with the non-tumor tissues. The silencing of circNOLC1 was able to
repress the viability of breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the numbers of colony
formation were suppressed by circNOLC1 knockdown in breast cancer cells. The
inhibition of circNOLC1 reduced the invasion and migration ability of breast
cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of E-cadherin were enhanced but
Vimentin levels were reduced by the silencing of circNOLC1. The repression of
circNOLC1 decreased the side population (SP) ratio in breast cancer cells.
Meanwhile, the sphere formation ability of breast cancer cells was attenuated by 
the silencing of circNOLC1. The levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily 
G member 2 (ABCG2), c-Myc, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus
integration site 1 (Bmi1), and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2) were
repressed by the depletion of circNOLC1 in the cells. Regarding to the mechanism,
circNOLC1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for microRNA-365a-3p
(miR-365a-3p) and the inhibition of miR-365a-3p rescued circNOLC1
depletion-repressed proliferation and cancer stem cell activity of breast cancer.
MiR-365a-3p targeted signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
in breast cancer cells and circNOLC1 enhanced STAT3 expression by sponging
miR-365a-3p. The overexpression of STAT3 could reverse miR-365a-3p or circNOLC1
depletion-inhibited proliferation and cancer stem cell properties of breast
cancer. Interestingly, the expression of circNOLC1 and STAT3 was repressed by the
treatment of propofol. The enrichment of STAT3 on circNOLC1 promoter was
inhibited by propofol. The expression of circNOLC1 was suppressed by the
silencing of STAT3 in the cells. The inhibition of circNOLC1 expression by
propofol was rescued under the co-treatment of STAT3 overexpression. The
overexpression of circNOLC1 rescued propofol-attenuated proliferation and cancer 
stem cell functions in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we concluded that circNOLC1 contributes to CSCs properties and
progression of breast cancer by targeting miR-365a-3p /STAT3 axis and propofol
inhibited circNOLC1 by repressing STAT3 in a feedback mechanism.
