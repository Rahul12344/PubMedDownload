Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to
efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific
targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with 
transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types.
Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent
reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although
nonamplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression,
immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used
to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were
injected into the neocortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak
but consistent nonamplified off-target double inverted open reading frame (DIO)
expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry
reporter revealed notable Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression
of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV 
serotype, or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had
functional effects via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs
(DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 (compound 21) had no effect on contextual fear 
conditioning or c-Fos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry+ cells of C57BL/6J mice.
Together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have off-target expression in 
wild-type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of
experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that
could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.
