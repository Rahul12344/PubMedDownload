Various living organisms have proven to influence human health significantly,
either in a commensal or pathogenic manner. Harnessing the creatures may
remarkably improve human healthcare and cure the intractable illness that is
challenged using traditional drugs or surgical approaches. However, issues
including limited biocompatibility, poor biosafety, inconvenience for personal
handling, and low patient compliance greatly hinder the biomedical and clinical
applications of living organisms when adopting them for disease treatment.
Microneedle arrays (MNAs), emerging as a promising candidate of biomedical
devices with the functional diversity and minimal invasion, have exhibited great 
potential in the treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases, which is expected to 
improve organism-based therapies. In this review, we systemically summarize the
technologies employed for the integration of MNAs with specific living organisms 
including diverse viruses, bacteria, mammal cells and so on. Moreover, their
applications such as vaccination, anti-infection, tumor therapy and tissue
repairing are well illustrated. Challenges faced by current strategies, and the
perspectives of integrating more living organisms, adopting smarter materials,
and developing more advanced technologies in MNAs for future personalized and
point-of-care medicine, are also discussed. It is believed that the combination
of living organisms with functional MNAs would hold great promise in the near
future due to the advantages of both biological and artificial species.
