BACKGROUND: Dutch standard diabetes care is generally protocol-driven. However,
considering that general practices wish to tailor diabetes care to individual
patients and encourage self-management, particularly in light of current COVID-19
related constraints, protocols and other barriers may hinder implementation. The 
impact of dispensing with protocol and implementation of self-management
interventions on patient monitoring and experiences are not known. This study
aims to evaluate tailoring of care by understanding experiences of well-organised
practices 1) when dispensing with protocol; 2) determining the key conditions for
successful implementation of self-management interventions; and furthermore
exploring patients' experiences regarding dispensing with protocol and
self-management interventions.
METHODS: in this mixed-methods prospective study, practices (n = 49) were invited
to participate if they met protocol-related quality targets, and their adult
patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes were invited if they had received
protocol-based diabetes care for a minimum of 1 year. For practices, study
participation consisted of the opportunity to deliver protocol-free diabetes
care, with selection and implementation of self-management interventions. For
patients, study participation provided exposure to protocol-free diabetes care
and self-management interventions. Qualitative outcomes (practices: 5 focus
groups, 2 individual interviews) included experiences of dispensing with protocol
and the implementation process of self-management interventions, operationalised 
as implementation fidelity. Quantitative outcomes (patients: routine registry
data, surveys) consisted of diabetes monitoring completeness, satisfaction,
wellbeing and health status at baseline and follow-up (24 months).
RESULTS: Qualitative: In participating practices (n = 4), dispensing with
protocol encouraged reflection on tailored care and selection of various
self-management interventions A focus on patient preferences, team collaboration 
and intervention feasibility was associated with high implementation fidelity
Quantitative: In patients (n = 126), likelihood of complete monitoring decreased 
significantly after two years (OR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.5), p < 0.001) Satisfaction
decreased slightly (- 1.6 (95% CI -2.6;-0.6), p = 0.001) Non-significant declines
were found in wellbeing (- 1.3 (95% CI -5.4; 2.9), p = 0.55) and health status
(- 3.0 (95% CI -7.1; 1.2), p = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: To tailor diabetes care to individual patients within well-organised
practices, we recommend dispensing with protocol while maintaining one structural
annual monitoring consultation, combined with the well-supported implementation
of feasible self-management interventions. Interventions should be selected and
delivered with the involvement of patients and should involve population
preferences and solid team collaborations.
