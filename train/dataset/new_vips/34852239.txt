The human monoclonal antibody C10 exhibits extraordinary cross-reactivity,
potently neutralizing Zika virus (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue virus
(DENV1-DENV4). Here we describe a comparative structure-function analysis of C10 
bound to the envelope (E) protein dimers of the five viruses it neutralizes. We
demonstrate that the C10 Fab has high affinity for ZIKV and DENV1 but not for
DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. We further show that the C10 interaction with the latter
viruses requires an E protein conformational landscape that limits binding to
only one of the three independent epitopes per virion. This limited affinity is
nevertheless counterbalanced by the particle's icosahedral organization, which
allows two different dimers to be reached by both Fab arms of a C10
immunoglobulin. The epitopes' geometric distribution thus confers C10 its
exceptional neutralization breadth. Our results highlight the importance not only
of paratope/epitope complementarity but also the topological distribution for
epitope-focused vaccine design.
