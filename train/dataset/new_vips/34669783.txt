Due to the high transfusion volume, polytransfused patients with sickle cell
disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia are constantly exposed to parenterally
transmitted infections. Currently, we have little information about the virome of
such patients and how the virological composition might be influenced by the
hemotherapy procedures that these patients receive. The objective of this study
was to compare the viral diversity between these two groups with respect to the
viral abundance and how it might be affected by the specific conditions of these 
groups. We sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared the virome 
of 30 patients with beta-thalassemia major, 45 with SCD, and 16 blood donors from
the Blood Center of Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. Predominantly, commensal viruses
including Torque teno virus (TTV) genotypes and human pegiviris-1 (HPgV-1) were
identified in each group. Strikingly, while HPgV-1 reads were dominant in the SCD
group, thalassemic patients showed high TTV abundance, expressed both in viral
reads and genotypes. We speculated that the commensal virome of polytransfused
patients might be influenced by the transfusion frequency and disease
characteristics and that commensal viruses might be used as important genetic
biomarkers for these hematological disturbances. Nevertheless, more specific
studies are necessary to confirm a relationship between blood virome and
transfusion treatment.
