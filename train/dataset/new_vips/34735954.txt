Controlling importation and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from overseas travelers is essential for countries,
such as Australia, New Zealand, and other island nations, that have adopted a
suppression strategy to manage very low community transmission. Wastewater
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has emerged as a promising tool employed in public
health response in many countries globally. This study aimed to establish whether
the surveillance of aircraft wastewater can be used to provide an additional
layer of information to augment individual clinical testing. Wastewater from 37
long-haul flights chartered to repatriate Australians was tested for the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Children 5 years or older on these flights tested negative for
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (deep nasal and oropharyngeal
reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR swab) 48 h before departure. All passengers
underwent mandatory quarantine for 14-day post arrival in Howard Springs, NT,
Australia. Wastewater from 24 (64.9 %) of the 37 flights tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. During the 14 day mandatory quarantine, clinical testing
identified 112 cases of COVID-19. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in repatriation
flight wastewater using pooled results from three RT-qPCR assays demonstrated a
positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.5 %, a negative predictive value (NPV) of
76.9 % and 83.7% accuracy for COVID-19 cases during the post-arrival 14-day
quarantine period. The study successfully demonstrates that the surveillance of
wastewater from aircraft for SARS-CoV-2 can provide an additional and effective
tool for informing the management of returning overseas travelers and for
monitoring the importation of SARS CoV-2 and other clinically significant
pathogens.
