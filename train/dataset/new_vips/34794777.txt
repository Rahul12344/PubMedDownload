OBJECTIVE: Prehospital emergency anesthesia in the form of rapid sequence
intubation (RSI) is a critical intervention delivered by advanced prehospital
critical care teams. Our previous simulation study determined the feasibility of 
in-aircraft RSI. We now examine whether this feasibility is preserved in a
simulated setting when clinicians wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for
aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) for in-aircraft, on-the-ground RSI.
METHODS: Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex is a helicopter emergency medical
service that uses an AW169 cabin simulator. Wearing full AGP PPE (eye protection,
FFP3 mask, gown, and gloves), 10 doctor-paramedic teams performed RSI in a
standard "can intubate, can ventilate" scenario and a "can't intubate, can't
oxygenate" (CICO) scenario. Prespecified timings were reported, and participant
feedback was sought by questionnaire.
RESULTS: RSI was most commonly performed by direct laryngoscopy and was
successfully achieved in all scenarios. The time to completed endotracheal
intubation (ETI) was fastest (287 seconds) in the standard scenario and slower
(370 seconds, P = .01) in the CICO scenario. The time to ETI was not
significantly delayed by wearing PPE in the standard (P = .19) or CICO variant
(P = .97). Communication challenges, equipment complications, and PPE
difficulties were reported, but ways to mitigate these were also reported.
CONCLUSION: In-aircraft RSI (aircraft on the ground) while wearing PPE for AGPs
had no significant impact on the time to successful completion of ETI in a
simulated setting. Patient safety is paramount in civilian helicopter emergency
medical services, but the adoption of in-aircraft RSI could confer significant
patient benefit in terms of prehospital time savings, and further research is
warranted.
