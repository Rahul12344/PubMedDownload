BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers have reported increased anxiety while working in
hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of healthcare students in a 
health crisis has been discussed among clinicians and researchers. The
simultaneous international shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) during
the first wave of the pandemic potentially exposed healthcare workers and
students to the virus during their work and clinical training. Our aim was
therefore to evaluate the extent to which paramedic students in Oslo, Norway,
were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were involved in voluntary and/or paid
healthcare-related work. An evaluation was also made of the students'
COVID-19-related symptoms and of their health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
during the first wave of the pandemic.
METHODS: Paramedic students (n = 155) at Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway,
were invited to complete an online survey five months after the first cases of
COVID-19 were detected. The university was situated in the epicenter of the
pandemic in Norway. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics,
independent sample t-tests, and linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 109 respondents (70.3%), 40 worked in patient-related healthcare 
work. Of those, seven (17.5%) students experienced insufficient supplies of PPE, 
six (15.0%) participated in aerosol-generating procedures without adequate PPE,
and nine (22.5%) experienced insufficient time to don PPE. Seventy-five (70.1%)
students experienced no COVID-19-related symptoms, and no students tested
positive for COVID-19. HRQoL was scored 0.92 (sd 0.12), which was significantly
higher than for the general population before the pandemic (p = 0.002). Students 
continued with their education and participated in a variety of pandemic-related 
emergency tasks during the first wave of the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Paramedic students were valuable contributors to the national
pandemic response. Despite potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in unpredictable
emergency settings with limited supplies of personal protection equipment, no
students tested positive for COVID-19. Their health-related quality of life
remained high. Students' participation and utilization in similar health crises
should be considered in future health crises.
