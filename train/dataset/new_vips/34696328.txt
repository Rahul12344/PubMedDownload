Phage therapy (PT) shows promising potential in managing biofilm infections,
which include refractory orthopedic infections. We report the case of a
13-year-old girl who developed chronic polymicrobial biofilm infection of a
pelvic bone allograft after Ewing's sarcoma resection surgery. Chronic infection 
by Clostridium hathewayi, Proteus mirabilis and Finegoldia magna was worsened by 
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus exhibiting an inducible
Macrolides-Lincosamides-Streptogramin B resistance phenotype (iMLSB). After
failure of conventional conservative treatment, combination of in situ anti-S.
aureus PT with surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy led to
marked clinical and microbiological improvement, yet failed to prevent a
recurrence of infection on the midterm. This eventually led to surgical graft
replacement. Multiple factors can explain this midterm failure, among which
incomplete coverage of the polymicrobial infection by PT. Indeed, no phage
therapy against C. hathewayi, P. mirabilis or F. magna could be administered.
Phage-antibiotic interactions were investigated using OmniLog® technology. Our
results suggest that phage-antibiotic interactions should not be considered
"unconditionally synergistic", and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Specific pharmacodynamics of phages and antibiotics might explain these
differences. More than two years after final graft replacement, the patient
remains cured of her sarcoma and no further infections occurred.
