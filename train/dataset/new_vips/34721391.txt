Background: Atopic march refers to the natural history of atopic dermatitis (AD) 
in infancy followed by subsequent allergic rhinitis and asthma in later life.
Respiratory viruses interact with allergic sensitization to promote recurrent
wheezing and the development of asthma. We aimed to evaluate whether influenza
vaccination reduces asthma risk in people with AD.
Methods: This cohort study was conducted retrospectively from 2000 to 2013 by the
National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients with newly
diagnosed AD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification code 691) were enrolled as the AD cohort. We matched each vaccinated
patient with one non-vaccinated patient according to age and sex. We observed
each participant until their first asthma event, or the end of the study on
December 31, 2013, whichever came first.
Results: Our analyses included 4,414 people with a mean age of 53 years. Of
these, 43.8 were male. The incidence density of asthma was 12.6 per 1,000
person-years for vaccinated patients, and 15.1 per 1000 person-years for
non-vaccinated patients. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of asthma in the
vaccinated cohort relative to the non-vaccinated cohort was 0.69 (95% CI =
0.55-0.87). Vaccinated patients had a lower cumulative incidence of asthma than
unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated participants in all age and sex groups trended 
toward a lower risk of asthma. People will reduce more asthma risk when taking
shots every year.
Conclusion: Influenza vaccination was associated with lower asthma risk in
patients with AD.
