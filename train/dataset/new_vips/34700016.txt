PURPOSE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common blood-borne infection in the 
United States, and a leading cause of liver disease, transplant, and mortality.
CDC HCV elimination goals include reducing HCV-related mortality by 65% (from
2015) by 2030.
METHODS: We used vital registry data (CDC WONDER) to estimate overall and
demographic-specific HCV-related mortality from 1999 to 2019 in San Francisco and
then used an exponential model to project progress toward HCV elimination. Local 
trends were compared to state and national trends.
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2019, there were 1819 HCV-related deaths in San
Francisco, representing an overall age-adjusted mortality rate of 9.4 (95% CI
9.0, 9.9) per 100,000 population. The age-adjusted HCV-related mortality rates
were significantly higher among males (13.7), persons aged 55 years and older
(28.0), Black and/or African Americans (32.2) compared to other racial groups,
and Hispanic/Latinos (11.6) compared to non-Hispanic and/or Latinos. Overall and 
in most subgroups, mortality rates were lowest between 2015 and 2019. Since 2015,
San Francisco observed a significantly larger reduction in agbe-adjusted
HCV-related mortality than California or the U.S. Projected age-adjusted
HCV-related mortality rates for San Francisco for 2020 and 2030 were 4.7 (95% CI 
3.5, 6.2) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.7, 1.8), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on trends between 2015 and 2019, San Francisco, California,
and the U.S. are projected to achieve 65% reduction in HCV-mortality at or before
2030. Based on current trends, San Francisco is projected to achieve this goal
earlier.
