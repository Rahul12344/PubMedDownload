The year 2019 has seen an emergence of the novel coronavirus named severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease of
2019 (COVID-19). Since the onset of the pandemic, biological and
interdisciplinary research is being carried out across the world at a rapid pace 
to beat the pandemic. There is an increased need to comprehensively understand
various aspects of the virus from detection to treatment options including drugs 
and vaccines for effective global management of the disease. In this review, we
summarize the salient findings pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 biology, including
symptoms, hosts, epidemiology, SARS-CoV-2 genome, and its emerging variants,
viral diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, alternative antiviral strategies
and application of machine learning heuristics and artificial intelligence for
effective management of COVID-19 and future pandemics.
