Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex
multi-system disease with no cure and no FDA-approved treatment. Approximately
25% of patients are house or bedbound, and some are so severe in function that
they require tube-feeding and are unable to tolerate light, sound, and human
touch. The overall goal of this case report was to (1) describe how past events
(e.g., chronic sinusitis, amenorrhea, tick bites, congenital neutropenia,
psychogenic polydipsia, food intolerances, and hypothyroidism) may have
contributed to the development of severe ME/CFS in a single patient, and (2) the 
extensive medical interventions that the patient has pursued in an attempt to
recover, which enabled her to return to graduate school after becoming bedridden 
with ME/CFS 4.5 years prior. This paper aims to increase awareness of the harsh
reality of ME/CFS and the potential complications following initiation of any
level of intervention, some of which may be necessary for long-term healing.
Treatments may induce severe paradoxical reactions (Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction) 
if high infectious loads are present. It is our hope that sharing this case will 
improve research and treatment options for ME/CFS.
