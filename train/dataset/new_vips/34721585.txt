Background: Hepatitis E virus infection is an emerging disease with varied
courses in pregnancy. There is a dearth of statistics among pregnant women.
Aim: To evaluate the prevalence, associated factors, and pregnancy outcome in
women that tested positive for hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies in pregnancy.
Research Methods. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among pregnant women
at a teaching hospital in Nigeria. Relevant information was collected using a
structured questionnaire. Blood was collected from each of the participants, and 
the serum was used to determine the presence of hepatitis E immunoglobulin M
(IgM) and G (IgG). The data were analysed using SPSS version 23. Associations
between variables were determined at a p value of <0.05.
Results: A total of 200 pregnant women participated in this study. The prevalence
of HEV infection among pregnant women was 28.00% (56/200). The mean age was
30.11 ± 5.88. Hepatitis E infection was significantly associated with age (p
value = 0.028), method of faecal disposal (p value = 0.043), and source of
drinking water (p value = 0.039). A total of 9/200 (4.50%) stillbirths were
recorded with 3/9 (33.33%) in women that tested positive for HEV antibodies.
About 4/200(2.00%) miscarriages were recorded, and 2/4 (50.00%) were in women
that tested positive for HEV antibodies. Hepatitis E infection was not
significantly associated with perinatal outcome (p value = 0.45). Only 1/56
(0.50%) maternal death was recorded among women that tested positive to hepatitis
E, and none was recorded among those that tested negative to hepatitis E
antibodies.
Conclusion: There was a significant statistical association between HEV infection
and age, method of faecal disposal, and source of drinking water. This
underscores the importance of the provision of clean water and safe faecal
disposal. Hepatitis E virus infection did not significantly affect the foetal and
maternal outcomes.
