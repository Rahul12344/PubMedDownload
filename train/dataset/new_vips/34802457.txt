There is currently a critical need to determine the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2
vaccination for immunocompromised patients. In this study, we determined the
neutralizing antibody response in 160 cancer patients diagnosed with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lung cancer, breast cancer, and various non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas (NHL), after they received two doses of mRNA vaccines. Serum from 46
mRNA vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) served as healthy controls. We
discovered that (1) cancer patients exhibited reduced neutralizing antibody titer
(NT50) compared to HCWs; (2) CLL and NHL patients exhibited the lowest NT50
levels, with 50-60% of them below the detection limit; (3) mean NT50 levels in
patients with CLL and NHL was ~2.6 fold lower than those with solid tumors; and
(4) cancer patients who received anti-B cell therapy exhibited significantly
reduced NT50 levels. Our results demonstrate an urgent need for novel
immunization strategies for cancer patients against SARS-CoV-2, particularly
those with hematological cancers and those on anti-B cell therapies.
