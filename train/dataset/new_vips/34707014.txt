OBJECTIVES: To investigate the quality of life, self-assessment of mental and
physical health, and their related factors inpatients with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
METHODS: A total of 1 500 patients were selected from people living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA) users in the WeChat work account from a Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Self-made General Condition Questionnaires, Perceived Social
Support Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, Self-Stigma Scale,HIV/ AIDS Stress Scale,
Patients Health Questionnaire for Depression (PHQ-2), Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-2 Scale (GAD-2), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the 12-Item Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-12) were used to conduct a one-to-one questionnaire survey
through WeChat video in the selected samples. Binary unconditional logistic
regression was used to investigate the influential factors for PLWHA quality of
life and mental and physical health.
RESULTS: A total of 1 146 valid samples were obtained. The total mean score of
Social Support Scale was 52±15, and 49.0% (562/1 146) of PLWHA users had low
level social support (≤52 points); the total mean score of Life Satisfaction
Scale was 13 ± 4, and 54.7% (627/1 146) of PLWHA users had high life satisfaction
(>13 points); the total mean score of Self-Stigma Scale was 34 ± 8, and 52.2%
(598/1 146) of PLWHA users had high self-stigma (>34 points); the total mean
score of Stress Scale was 40±20, and 48.8% (559/1 146) of PLWHA users had high
stress (>40 points); 53.4% (612/1 146) of PLWHA users had depressive symptoms in 
the past 2 weeks, 63.3% (725/1 146) had anxiety symptoms, and 24.3% (278/1 146)
of PLWHA users had fair or very poor sleep quality in the past 1 month.There were
significant differences in the mean standard scores of the 8 dimensions of the
SF-12 scale in the PLWHA and the ordinary residents (all P<0.001). The results of
binary unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that the poor sleep
quality (OR=1.53, P<0.01), the HIV/AIDS-related stress (OR=1.42, P<0.05), the
abnormal indicators in the last physical examination (OR=1.49, P<0.01), and the
other chronic diseases in addition to HIV (OR=1.87, P<0.01) were risk factors for
poor physical health domains of PLWHA quality of life; and the poor life
satisfaction (OR=2.49, P<0.01), the suicidal ideation (OR=2.03, P<0.01), the
depression (OR=3.26, P<0.01), the anxiety (OR=3.58, P<0.01), the poor sleep
quality (OR=2.53, P<0.01), HIV/AIDS-related stress (OR=2.42, P<0.01), and the low
levels of social support (OR=1.46, P<0.05) were the risk factors for poor mental 
health domains in PLWHA quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the ordinary residents, the PLWHA have lower quality
of life, and we should focus on interventions to improve their physical and
mental health.

Publisher: 目的: 分析人类免疫缺陷病毒(human immunodeficiency virus，HIV)感染者/艾滋病(acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome，AIDS)患者(people living with
HIV/AIDS，PLWHA)的生命质量、自评心身健康状况及其相关因素。方法: 从某疾病预防控制中心微信工作号的PLWHA用户中抽取1
500人，采用一般情况调查表、领悟社会支持量表、生活满意度量表、歧视知觉量表、HIV/AIDS压力量表、病人健康问卷抑郁量表、广泛性焦虑量表、匹兹堡睡眠质量指数、
12条目简短生命质量量表(12-item short form health
survey，SF-12)等对受试者进行微信连线一对一问卷调查。采用二分类非条件logistic回归模型分析PLWHA生命质量、心身健康的影响因素。结果: 获得1
146名有效样本，社会支持量表总分为52±15，49.0%(562/1 146)的PLWHA社会支持水平较低；生活满意度量表总分为13±4，54.7%(627/1
146)的PLWHA生活满意度较高；歧视知觉量表总分为34±8，52.2%(598/1
146)的PLWHA歧视知觉较高；压力量表总分为40±20，48.8%(559/1 146)的PLWHA压力较大；过去2周内53.4%(612/1
146)的PLWHA有抑郁症状，63.3%(725/1 146)有焦虑症状，24.3%(278/1
146)在过去1个月内睡眠质量一般或很差。PLWHA与普通居民在SF-12量表8个维度标准分的差异均有统计学意义(均P<0.01)；logistic回归结果显示：
睡眠质量较差(OR=1.53，P<0.01)、压力较大(OR=1.42，P<0.05)、最近一次体检结果不正常(OR=1.49，P<0.01)、除艾滋病外患有其他
慢性病(OR=1.87，
P<0.01)是PLWHA生命质量生理健康领域较差的危险因素；生活满意度较低(OR=2.49，P<0.01)、有自杀意念(OR=2.03，P<0.01)、抑郁(O
R=3.26，P<0.01)、焦虑(OR=3.58，P<0.01)、睡眠质量较差(OR=2.53，P<0.01)、压力较大
(OR=2.42，P<0.01)、社会支持水平较低(OR=1.46，P<0.05)是PLWHA生命质量心理健康领域较差的危险因素。结论:
相对于普通居民而言，PLWHA生命质量较差，应注重采取相关干预措施以促进其心身健康。.
