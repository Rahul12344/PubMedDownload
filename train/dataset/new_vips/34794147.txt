INTRODUCTION: In the trials of corona virus vaccines, detailed analyses of
subsets of lymphocytes were not carried out. We present perhaps the most
comprehensive immunological analysis of 29 subsets of B and T cells in 2 healthy 
subjects receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine.
METHODS: Analyses were performed prior to vaccination, 3 weeks following the 1st 
dose, and 4 weeks following the 2nd dose. Total, naïve (TN), and different memory
and effector subsets (TCM, TEM, and TEMRA) of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; SARS-CoV-2
spike protein-specific tetramer+, and cytotoxic CD8+ T; subsets of T follicular
cells (TFH, TFH1, TFH2, TFH1/TFH17, and TFH17); B-cell subsets (mature B cells,
naive B cells, transitional B cells, marginal zone B cells, class-switched memory
B cells, germinal center B cells, and CD21low B cells), and plasmablasts; and
regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+ Treg, CD8+ Treg, Breg, and TFR cells) were evaluated
with specific monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: A lack of COVID-19 IgG antibodies after the 1st dose in one of 2
subjects was associated with increased regulatory lymphocytes and decreased
plasmablasts. Seroconversion after the 2nd dose in this subject was associated
with decreased TFR cells and increased plasmablasts. In both subjects, CD4 TEM
and CD8 TCM were markedly increased following the 2nd dose. TFH1 and regulatory
lymphocytes were increased (except Breg) following the 1st dose. A striking
increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells was observed following the 2nd dose.
CONCLUSION: Our data support the need for 2nd dose of vaccine to induce strong
SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell specific response and generation of memory subsets of CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells. Regulatory lymphocytes appear to play a role in the magnitude
of response.
