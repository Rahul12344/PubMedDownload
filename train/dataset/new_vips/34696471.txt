Coronavirus, an important zoonotic disease, raises concerns of future pandemics. 
The bat is considered a source of noticeable viruses resulting in human and
livestock infections, especially the coronavirus. Therefore, surveillance and
genetic analysis of coronaviruses in bats are essential in order to prevent the
risk of future diseases. In this study, the genome of HCQD-2020, a novel
alphacoronavirus detected in a bat (Eptesicus serotinus), was assembled and
described using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The
comparison of the whole-genome sequence and the conserved amino acid sequence of 
replicated proteins revealed that the new strain was distantly related with other
known species in the Alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic construction indicated 
that this strain formed a separated branch with other species, suggesting a new
species of Alphacoronavirus. Additionally, in silico prediction also revealed the
risk of cross-species infection of this strain, especially in the order
Artiodactyla. In summary, this study provided the genetic characteristics of a
possible new species belonging to Alphacoronavirus.
