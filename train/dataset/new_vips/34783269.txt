BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed and disrupted healthcare
services worldwide, particularly healthcare workers (HCW). HCW are essential
workers performing any job in a healthcare setting who are potentially directly
or indirectly exposed to infectious materials. Our retrospective cohort study
aimed to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infections among HCW in Jakarta and
neighbouring areas during the first three months of the pandemic.
METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimens from HCW working at private 
and public hospitals in Jakarta and neighbouring areas were screened for
SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020. Data on demography, clinical symptoms,
contact history, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected using
standardised forms.
RESULTS: Among 1201 specimens, 7.9% were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with
the majority coming from medical doctors (48.4%) and nurses (44.2%). 64.2% of the
positive cases reported to have contact with suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases,
including 32 (52.2%) with patient and 3 (6.6%) with co-worker. The symptomatic
HCW had a significantly lower median Ct value as compared to their asymptomatic
counterpart (p < .001). Tendency to have a higher prevalence of pneumonia was
observed in the age group of 40 - 49 and ≥50 years old.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted the necessity to implement proper preventive
and surveillance strategies for this high-risk population including adherence to 
strict PPE protocol and appropriate training.Key MessageHealthcare workers (HCW),
defined as those handling any job in a healthcare setting, are at the frontline
of risk of infection as SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through airborne
droplets and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. The aim of our study is
to attain a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the impact of COVID-19 on 
HCW during the earlier phase of the outbreak in Indonesia to develop effective
strategies that protect the health and safety of this workforce. Our findings
highlighted that COVID-19 infections in HCW were mostly acquired in healthcare
settings, with significant consequences of pneumonia and hospitalisation
occurring across all age groups.
