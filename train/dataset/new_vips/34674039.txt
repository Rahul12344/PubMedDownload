PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Aphasia is an acquired neurological language disorder after
brain damages. Persons with aphasia (PWA) are more susceptible to behavioral and 
emotional implications due to inherent communication and/or cognitive
difficulties. Currently, little is known regarding the impact of COVID-19 on PWA.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are now growing reports with evidence of neurological and 
dysexecutive syndromes subsequent to interference of brain functions in acute
patients with COVID-19, leading to variable aphasia-like symptoms. COVID-19
affected chronic PWA more in terms of disrupted communication and daily routines,
worsened psychosocial well-being, and difficulties getting aphasia services that 
adequately addressed their needs. Acute versus chronic PWA were
disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Recognizing, examining, and managing
COVID-19-related neurological and behavioral problems in PWA is not
straightforward. As we passed the 1-year mark and approaching the 2-year mark of 
the onset of COVID-19, more research is necessary to prioritize strategies for
improving current evidence-based care and rehabilitation of aphasia.
