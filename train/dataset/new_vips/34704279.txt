Very young age could be a potential risk factor for community-acquired severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, due to immature immune systems. We
retrospectively enrolled 39 infants up to 6 months of age who had presented to
our tertiary Italian children's hospital emergency room between 9 March 2020 and 
8 March 2021 and tested positive for the virus. Of those, 38 had a non-specific
mild or asymptomatic clinical course and only one patient was admitted to
intensive care with severe symptoms. We concluded that very young infants with
COVID-19 had a generally favourable disease course.
