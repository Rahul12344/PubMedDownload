Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem, in which the majority of cases
occur in population-dense developing countries. Despite advances in various
diagnostic TB modalities, extrapulmonary TB remains a challenge due to
complexities related to its diagnostic approach. Hereby, we present a rare case
of endocarditis and spondylodiscitis associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(MTB). This case report highlighted the challenges faced in diagnosing blood
culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNIE). We also emphasized the
importance of considering MTB as etiology of BCNIE, particularly in endemic TB
areas.
