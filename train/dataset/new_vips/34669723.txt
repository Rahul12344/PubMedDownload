BACKGROUND: Adherence to preventive measures of Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was among the means to tackle the transmission of the virus. However, 
reluctance to implement the recommended preventive measures has been reported to 
be a major problem everywhere including Oromia Regional State.
PURPOSE: This research was aimed to assess the level of adherence to COVID-19
preventive measures and associated factors in the study area.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted.
Sample of 2751 adults aged â‰¥ 18 years were used for the quantitative study. Also,
20 FGDs and 30 KIIs were conducted in the qualitative approach. The collected
data were entered into Epi info version 7.2.0.1 and analyzed using STATA 15. The 
qualitative data were entered into NVivo version 12 for its organization.
Bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to
determine the association between the study variables. Odds Ratio with its 95%CI 
was calculated and P- Value < 0.05 was used as a cut off points to declare the
significance.
RESULTS: The level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure was 8.3. Age [AOR,
4.00; 95% CI: 1.50, 10.45], Illiterate AOR, 0.38; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.93], read and
write [AOR, 0.26; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.72], attended primary [AOR, 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13,
0.70], occupation (AOR; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.96] and knowledge [AOR, 0.20; 95% CI:
0.01, 0.11] were factors associated with level of adherence to COVID-19
preventive measures. Political context, unemployment, livelihoods, and social
events were mentioned as reasons for the poor adherence to COVID-19 preventive
measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures in
the study area was low. Age, level of education, occupation, and knowledge were
factors associated with level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures.
Activities to increase the adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures should be
implemented by the concerned bodies.
