Without a doubt, the current global pandemic affects all walks of our life. It
affected almost every age group all over the world with a disease named COVID-19,
declared as a global pandemic by WHO in early 2020. Due to the high transmission 
and moderate mortality rate of this virus, it is also regarded as the panic-zone 
virus. This potentially deadly virus has pointed up the significance of COVID-19 
research. Due to the rapid transmission of COVID-19, early detection is very
crucial. Presently, there are different conventional techniques are available for
coronavirus detection like CT-scan, PCR, Sequencing, CRISPR, ELISA, LFA, LAMP.
The urgent need for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective detection and the
requirement to cut off shortcomings of traditional detection methods, make
scientists realize to advance new technologies. Biosensors are one of the
reliable platforms for accurate, early diagnosis. In this article, we have
pointed recent diagnosis approaches for COVID-19. The review includes basic
virology of SARS-CoV-2 mainly clinical and pathological features. We have also
briefly discussed different types of biosensors, their working principles, and
current advancement for COVID-19 detection and prevention.
