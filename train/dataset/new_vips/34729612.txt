OBJECTIVES: Dysphagia is a common symptom in patients hospitalized with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are limited data on the relation between
dysphagia and important hospital outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the
impact of dysphagia on hospital costs, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and
30-day readmission rates in HIV patients hospitalized with dysphagia.
METHODS: We used the Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify all adult
hospitalizations with HIV between January 2010 and September 2015. We stratified 
cases according to the presence of dysphagia (International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 787.2) as a primary or
secondary diagnosis, and compared clinical and hospital characteristics between
the two groups. Multivariable regression models were used to compare LOS, total
hospital costs, in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 30-day readmission
rates between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 206,332 hospitalized patients with HIV were included in the
study. Of these, 8699 (4.2%) patients had dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia were
more likely to have Candida esophagitis (26.8% vs 3.6%), esophageal strictures
(3.1% vs 0.2%), and malnutrition (41.6% vs 17.6%); and they were more likely to
undergo upper endoscopy (23.2% vs 3.8%) and percutaneous feeding tube placement
(9.2% vs 0.7%), all P < 0.0001. On multivariate analysis, dysphagia was
associated with longer LOS (12 vs 7.4 days; P < 0.0001), higher hospitalization
cost ($32,993 vs $21,813, P < 0.0001), and increased 30-day readmissions (24% vs 
20.8%, adjusted odds ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.25; P < 0.0001). 
Patients with dysphagia had higher in-hospital mortality (4.7% vs 3.5%) but this 
did not reach statistical significance (adjusted odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence 
interval 0.91-1.12; P = 0.86).
CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients with HIV, dysphagia is a significant
independent predictor of longer LOS, higher costs, and higher rates of 30-day
readmissions. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing treatment of 
dysphagia in patients with HIV to mitigate its negative impact on patient and
hospital outcomes.
