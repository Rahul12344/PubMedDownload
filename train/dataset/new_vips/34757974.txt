BACKGROUND: This study investigated the sustained virologic responses (SVRs)
among prisoners with hepatitis C virus (HCV) using universal test-and-treat
approach by prison health care workers in a central male prison in Thailand.
METHODS: A universal HCV screening was conducted in a maximum-security central
prison (Klong Prem Central Prison) in Thailand. HCV RNA-confirmed prisoners were 
treated with generic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by prison health care workers,
regardless of their HCV genotypes and duration of prison sentences. We evaluated 
the SVR rates at 12 weeks after completing direct acting antivirals (DAA)
treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 68 prisoners with detectable HCV RNA received DAA treatment. 
The median age and duration of prison sentences were 44 years (interquartile
range, 41-53) and 25 (interquartile range, 19-33) years, respectively.
Twenty-five percentage of the participants was coinfected with HIV, and 6% of the
participants was coinfected with hepatitis B virus. Among all prisoners who
received DAA treatment, 20 (29%) had genotype (GT)-1a, 3 (4%) had GT-1b, 22 (32%)
had GT-3a, 3 (4%) had GT-3b, and 7 (10%) had GT-6. Overall, improvements in liver
biomarkers were seen after HCV treatment, and SVR was achieved in 97% of the
participants with per-protocol analysis and in 90% of the participants with
intention-to-treat analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV treatment using DAA among prisoners through universal
test-and-treat approach led by prison health care workers is highly effective and
safe, and such model can potentially help to facilitate the goals of HCV
microelimination among prisoners in Thailand.
