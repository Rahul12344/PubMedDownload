As an alternative to traditional teaching, e-learning has enabled continuity of
learning for health professions students during the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. This review explored health professions students;
perceptions, acceptance, motivation, and engagement with e-learning during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review was conducted by consulting 5
databases: PubMed, ERIC (Ebsco), Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science. The 
quality of the included studies was assessed using the Medical Education Research
Study Quality Instrument. The research protocol was previously registered in the 
PROSPERO registry (CRD42021237055). From 250 studies identified, 15 were selected
with a total of 111,622 students. Mostly positive perceptions were reported in 7 
of 12 studies, which mainly focused on technology access, possession of basic
computer skills, pedagogical design of online courses, online interactions, and
learning flexibility. However, predominantly negative perceptions were identified
in 5 of 12 studies, which pointed out constraints related to internet
connections, the use of educational platforms, and acquisition of clinical
skills. Satisfactory levels of acceptance of distance learning were reported in 3
of 4 studies. For student motivation and engagement, 1 study reported similar or 
higher motivation than with traditional teaching, and another study indicated
that student engagement significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Health professions students showed a positive response to e-learning regarding
perceptions, acceptance, motivation, and engagement. Future research is needed to
remediate the lack of studies addressing health professions students’ motivation 
and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
