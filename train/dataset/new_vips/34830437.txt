Contamination of cells/tissues by infectious pathogens (e.g., fungi, viruses, or 
bacteria, including mycoplasma) is a major problem in cell-based transplantation.
In this study, we tested a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to provide
rapid, simple, and sensitive detection of mycoplasma contamination in laboratory 
cultures for clinical use. This mycoplasma PCR system covers the Mycoplasma
species (spp.) listed for testing in the 17th revision of the Japanese
Pharmacopoeia, and we designed it for use in transplantable retinal cells. Here, 
we analyzed mycoplasma contamination in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS
cell)-derived transplantable retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. In the spike
tests to RPE cells with nine species of class Mollicutes bacteria, including
seven Mycoplasma spp. and one of each Acholeplasma spp. and Ureaplasma spp.,
contamination at the concentration of 100 and 10 CFU/mL were detected with 100%
probability in all cases, while 1 CFU/mL had a detection rate of 0-75%. DNA
prepared from bacteria species other than class Mollicutes species was not
detectable, indicating the specificity of this PCR. While iPS cells and iPS-RPE
cells established in our laboratory were all negative by this PCR, some of the
commercially available cell lines were positive. Cells for transplantation should
never have infection, as once pathogens are implanted into the eyes, they can
cause severe intraocular inflammation. Thus, it is imperative to monitor for
infections in the transplants, although generally, mycoplasma infection is
difficult to detect.
