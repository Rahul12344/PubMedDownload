The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic forced healthcare workers to use all
their professional and personal skills to battle it. The unexpected onset of the 
disease has led to extraordinary pressure on healthcare workers and has
challenged their resilience. The study aimed to explore the subjective
experiences of 18 Israeli nurses who are directly treating COVID-19 patients, and
to identify the sources of resilience used by nurses to address national health
crises. The data were gathered via semi-structured interviews and thematically
analyzed. The analysis yielded three central analytic themes that described the
nurses' experiences during the pandemic: maneuvering between professional demands
and personal-family life; the nurses' coping strategies and resilience; and
nurses' use of metaphorical military language as a way of coping with the
difficulties. The findings show that in a time of severe health crisis, and
despite the fear of infection, nurses adhere to the values of the profession and 
are willing to fight the virus to save lives. The nurses' extensive use of
military metaphorical language reflected their experiences, strengthened them,
and provided them with a source of empowerment in the face of a common enemy that
needed to be overcome.
