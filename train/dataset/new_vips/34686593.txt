Many viruses directly engage and require the dynein-dynactin motor-adaptor
complex in order to transport along microtubules (MTs) to the nucleus and
initiate infection. HIV type 1 (HIV-1) exploits dynein, the dynein adaptor BICD2,
and core dynactin subunits but unlike several other viruses, does not require
dynactin-1 (DCTN1). The underlying reason for HIV-1's variant dynein engagement
strategy and independence from DCTN1 remains unknown. Here, we reveal that DCTN1 
actually inhibits early HIV-1 infection by interfering with the ability of viral 
cores to interact with critical host cofactors. Specifically, DCTN1 competes for 
binding to HIV-1 particles with cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP170), one of 
several MT plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) that regulate the stability of
viral cores after entry into the cell. Outside of its function as a dynactin
subunit, DCTN1 also functions as a +TIP that we find sequesters CLIP170 from
incoming particles. Deletion of the Zinc knuckle (Zn) domain in CLIP170 that
mediates its interactions with several proteins, including DCTN1, increased
CLIP170 binding to virus particles but failed to promote infection, further
suggesting that DCTN1 blocks a critical proviral function of CLIP170 mediated by 
its Zn domain. Our findings suggest that the unique manner in which HIV-1 binds
and exploits +TIPs to regulate particle stability leaves them vulnerable to the
negative effects of DCTN1 on +TIP availability and function, which may in turn
have driven HIV-1 to evolve away from DCTN1 in favor of BICD2-based engagement of
dynein during early infection.
