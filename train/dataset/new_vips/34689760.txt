BACKGROUND: Several specific risk scores for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
involving clinical and biochemical parameters have been developed from
higher-risk patients, in addition to validating well-established pneumonia risk
scores. We compared multiple risk scores in predicting more severe disease in a
cohort of young patients with few comorbid illnesses. Accurately predicting the
progression of COVID-19 may guide triage and therapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined 554 hospitalised COVID-19 patients in
Singapore. The CURB-65 score, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), ISARIC 4C
prognostic score (4C), CHA2DS2-VASc score, COVID-GRAM Critical Illness risk score
(COVID-GRAM), Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 index for COVID-19
Mortality (VACO), and the "rule-of-6" score were compared for three performance
characteristics: the need for supplemental oxygen, intensive care admission and
mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: A majority of patients were young (≤ 40 years, n = 372, 67.1%). 57
(10.3%) developed pneumonia, with 16 (2.9% of study population) requiring
supplemental oxygen. 19 patients (3.4%) required intensive care and 2 patients
(0.5%) died. The clinical risk scores predicted patients who required
supplemental oxygenation and intensive care well. Adding the presence of fever to
the CHA2DS2-VASc score and 4C score improved the ability to predict patients who 
required supplemental oxygen (c-statistic 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.94; and 0.84, 95%
CI 0.75-0.94 respectively).
CONCLUSION: Simple scores including well established pneumonia risk scores can
help predict progression of COVID-19. Adding the presence of fever as a parameter
to the CHA2DS2-VASc or the 4C score improved the performance of these scores in a
young population with few comorbidities.
