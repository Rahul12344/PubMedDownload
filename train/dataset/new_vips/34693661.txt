BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sequential therapy with molecular-targeted agents (MTAs) is 
considered effective for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
This study purposed to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapy with sorafenib
(SORA) as a first-line therapy and to investigate the therapeutic impact of SORA 
in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steato hepatitis
(NASH)-related HCC.
METHODS: We evaluated 504 HCC patients treated with SORA (Study-1). The times of 
administration for sorafenib from 2009 to 2015, 2016 to 2017, and 2018 and later 
were defined as the early-, mid-, and late-term periods, respectively. Among
them, 180 HCC patients treated with SORA in addition to MTAs in the mid- and
late-term periods were divided into groups based on disease etiology (NAFLD or
NASH [n = 37] and viral or alcohol [n = 143]), and outcomes were compared after
inverse probability weighting (IPW) (Study-2).
RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) of HCC patients who received sequential MTA
therapy after first-line SORA was significantly longer. The median survival times
(MST) were 12.6 versus 17.6 versus 17.4 months in the early-term group, mid-term 
group, and the later-time group (early vs. mid, p = 0.014, early vs. later.
p = 0.045), respectively. (Study-1). In Study-2, there was no significant
differences in OS between the Virus/alcohol group and the NAFLD/NASH group in
patients who received sequential therapy (MST was 23.4 and 27.0 months p = 0.173,
respectively). The NAFLD or NASH, female sex, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2b, 
and major Vp (Vp3/Vp4) were significant factors for OS treated with SORA.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy with SORA as the first-line treatment improved
the prognosis of unresectable HCC patients and was effective regardless of HCC
etiology.
