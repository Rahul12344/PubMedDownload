Z-DNA Binding protein 1 (ZBP1) activates Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 3
(RIPK3) -dependent cell death during lytic infection by members of the
orthomyxovirus, herpesvirus and poxvirus families. ZBP1 possesses two Zα domains 
capable of selective binding to Z-DNA, as well as to Z-RNA. We have now unveiled 
Z-RNA as the ligand that activates ZBP1 in cells infected with orthomyxoviruses
(influenza A and B viruses) and the poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV).
Orthomyxovirus Z-RNA is sensed by ZBP1 in the nucleus of infected cells,
resulting in nuclear activation of RIPK3, consequent rupture of the nucleus, and 
hyper-inflammatory 'nuclear necroptosis'. VACV-generated Z-RNA accumulates in the
cytoplasm, where it is sequestered from ZBP1 by E3, the viral E3L gene product.
In viruses where the E3 Zα domain has been mutated, ZBP1 senses Z-RNA and
triggers RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in the cytoplasm. Z-RNA is thus a new viral 
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP).
