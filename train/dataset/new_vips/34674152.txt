Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 cellular
entry. Here we studied the effects of common comorbidities in severe COVID-19 on 
ACE2 expression. ACE2 levels (by enzyme activity and ELISA measurements) were
determined in human serum, heart and lung samples from patients with hypertension
(n = 540), heart transplantation (289) and thoracic surgery (n = 49). Healthy
individuals (n = 46) represented the controls. Serum ACE2 activity was increased 
in hypertensive subjects (132%) and substantially elevated in end-stage heart
failure patients (689%) and showed a strong negative correlation with the left
ventricular ejection fraction. Serum ACE2 activity was higher in male (147%),
overweight (122%), obese (126%) and elderly (115%) hypertensive patients. Primary
lung cancer resulted in higher circulating ACE2 activity, without affecting ACE2 
levels in the surrounding lung tissue. Male sex resulted in elevated serum ACE2
activities in patients with heart transplantation or thoracic surgery (146% and
150%, respectively). Left ventricular (tissular) ACE2 activity was unaffected by 
sex and was lower in overweight (67%), obese (62%) and older (73%) patients with 
end-stage heart failure. There was no correlation between serum and tissular
(left ventricular or lung) ACE2 activities. Neither serum nor tissue (left
ventricle or lung) ACE2 levels were affected by RAS inhibitory medications.
Abandoning of ACEi treatment (non-compliance) resulted in elevated blood pressure
without effects on circulating ACE2 activities. ACE2 levels associate with the
severity of cardiovascular diseases, suggestive for a role of ACE2 in the
pathomechanisms of cardiovascular diseases and providing a potential explanation 
for the higher mortality of COVID-19 among cardiovascular patients. Abandoning
RAS inhibitory medication worsens the cardiovascular status without affecting
circulating or tissue ACE2 levels.
