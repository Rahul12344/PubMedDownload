Mirror syndrome (MS) or Ballantyne's syndrome is a rare maternal condition that
can be life-threatening for both mother and fetus. The condition is characterized
by maternal signs and symptoms similar to those seen in preeclampsia in the
setting of fetal hydrops. Despite recent advances in the field of maternal-fetal 
medicine, the etiopathogenesis of MS remains elusive. For patients and doctors,
the COVID-19 pandemic has become an extra hurdle to overcome. The following case 
illustrates how patients' non-compliance associated with mirror syndrome and
SARS-CoV-2 infection led to the tragic end of a 19-year-old patient. Therefore,
knowledge of the signs and symptoms of mirror syndrome should always be part of
the armamentarium of every obstetrician.
