Miniaturized electrokinetic methods have proven to be robust platforms for the
analysis and assessment of intact microorganisms, offering short response times
and higher integration than their bench-scale counterparts. The present review
article discusses three types of electrokinetic-based methodologies:
electromigration or motion-based techniques, electrode-based electrokinetics, and
insulator-based electrokinetics. The fundamentals of each type of methodology are
discussed and relevant examples from recent reports are examined, to provide the 
reader with an overview of the state-of-the-art on the latest advancements on the
analysis of intact cells and viruses with microscale electrokinetic techniques.
The concluding remarks discuss the potential applications and future directions.
