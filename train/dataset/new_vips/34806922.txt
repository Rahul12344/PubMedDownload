The current therapy for myocarditis is immunosuppressive therapy. However, in
rare cases in which patients do not respond to intervention, their condition can 
rapidly deteriorate to myocarditis with shock, which is characterized by
extensive and diffuse lymphocyte infiltration in the myocardium. Most cases of
myocarditis are caused by virus-mediated damage of cardiomyocytes, and its
clinical manifestations are ventricular arrhythmia and hemodynamic disturbances. 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an effective intervention, which regulates
hemodynamic stability and avoids systemic hypoperfusion. This intervention has
been used to sustain hemodynamic stability in patients with myocarditis and
shock. We report here early application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
for successful treatment of a patient with myocarditis and shock.
