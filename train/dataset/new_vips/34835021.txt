It is generally believed that a successful Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine should
induce neutralizing antibodies against the ZIKV envelope (E) protein to
efficiently halt viral infection. However, E-specific neutralizing antibodies
have been implicated in a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement, which
represents an ongoing concern in the flavivirus-vaccinology field. In this
report, we investigated the vaccination potential of replication-deficient
adenoviral vectors encoding the ZIKV non-structural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2)
and employed the strategy of linking the antigens to the MHC-II associated
invariant chain (li) to improve immunogenicity and by inference, the level of
protection. We demonstrated that li-linkage enhanced the production of anti-NS1
antibodies and induced an accelerated and prolonged polyfunctional CD8 T cell
response in mice, which ultimately resulted in a high degree of protection
against ZIKV infection of the CNS.
