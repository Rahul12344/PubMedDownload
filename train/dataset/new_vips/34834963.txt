Understanding the dynamic relationship between viral pathogens and cellular host 
factors is critical to furthering our knowledge of viral replication, disease
mechanisms and development of anti-viral therapeutics. CRISPR genome editing
technology has enhanced this understanding, by allowing identification of
pro-viral and anti-viral cellular host factors for a wide range of viruses, most 
recently the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. This review will discuss
how CRISPR knockout and CRISPR activation genome-wide screening methods are a
robust tool to investigate the viral life cycle and how other class 2 CRISPR
systems are being repurposed for diagnostics.
