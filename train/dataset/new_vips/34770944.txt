Investigation of the n-BuOH extract of the aerial parts of Elsholtzia bodinieri
led to the isolation of seven new triterpenoid saponins, Bodiniosides S-Y (1-7,
resp.). Their strictures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic
techniques, including HSQC, HSBC, and HSQC-TOCSY experiments, together with acid 
hydrolysis and GC analysis. The anti-influenza activities of compounds 1-7 were
evaluated against A/WSN/33/2009 (H1N1) virus in MDCK cells. The results showed
that compounds 2 and 5 exhibited moderate anti-influenza activities against
A/WSN/33/2009 (H1N1), with inhibition rates of 35.33% and 24.08%, respectively.
