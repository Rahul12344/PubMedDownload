AIM: During several local COVID-19 outbreaks in China in 2020, SARS-CoV-2 or its 
RNA was isolated or detected from frozen food or packages, revealing the lack of 
effective disinfection measures in the frozen food chain and risk of
transmission. We explored the possibility that disinfectant plus antifreeze could
be delivered as thermal fog to realize effective disinfection at subzero
temperatures.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected two disinfectant-antifreeze combinations,
didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) - propylene glycol (PPG) and peracetic
acid (PAA) - triethylene glycol (TEG) and each combination is used with a
custom-optimized thermal fogging machine. The two fogs were tested in -20 °C
freezer warehouses for their disinfection efficacy against a coronavirus porcine 
epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field strain, a swine influenza virus (SIV) field 
strain, and three indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and
Bacillus subtilis endospores. At -20 °C, the DDAB-PPG or PAA-TEG thermal fogs
settle within 3.5 to 4.5 hours, and effectively inactivated PEDV with median
tissue culture infective dose of 10-3.5 0.1 ml-1 and SIV-H1N1 with
hemagglutination titer of 26 ml-1 within 15-60 min. DDAB-PPG could inactivate S. 
aureus and E. coli vegetative cells (106 cfu ml-1 ) within 15-60 min but not
effective on B. subtilis spores, while PAA-TEG could disinfect B. subtilis spores
more effectively than for S. aureus and E. coli.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that a practical subzero temperature disinfection
technology was effective in killing enveloped viruses and vegetative bacteria or 
bacterial spores. DDAB-PPG or PAA-TEG thermal fogging may be a practical
technology for cold-chain disinfection.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This subzero temperature disinfection
technology could help to meet the urgent public health need of environmental
disinfection in frozen food logistics against pandemic and other potential
pathogens and to enhance national and international biosecurity.
