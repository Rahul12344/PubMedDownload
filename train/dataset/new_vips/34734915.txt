PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused extreme concern for patients with inborn errors 
of immunity (IEIs). In the first 6  months of the pandemic, the case fatality
rate among patients with IEIs resembled that of the general population (9%). This
review aims at summarizing what we have learned about the course and outcome of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with different IEIs and what this
can potentially teach us about the immune mechanisms that could confer protection
or predisposition to severe disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 649 patients with IEI and COVID-19 have been reported
in the last year and a half, spanning all groups of the International Union of
Immunological Societies classification of IEIs. For most patients, the underlying
IEI does not represent an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. In fact,
some IEI may even be protective against the severe disease due to impaired
inflammation resulting in less immune-mediated collateral tissue damage.
SUMMARY: We review the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large number 
of patients with IEI. Overall, we found that combined immunodeficiencies, immune 
dysregulation disorders, and innate immune defects impairing type I interferon
responses are associated with severe disease course.
