Background: Dengue virus (DENV) continues to be an epidemic with high mortality
rates. The clinical features, especially in the early phase of infection, are
nonspecific and there is no single marker that can be reliably deployed for
diagnostics. Further, serotype and genotype diversity is not clearly understood. 
This study was conceived to understand the performance characteristics of various
diagnostic markers; serotype and genotype distribution is thus a vital
requirement.
Methods: A subset of blood samples was obtained for all the clinically suspected 
Dengue cases during the period January to December 2017. The samples were tested 
for IgM and IgG antibodies and NS1 antigen by both ELISA and rapid tests.
Real-time PCR, Conventional PCR and sequencing was performed based on the
serology results. Correlation of the data with demographic and clinical details
was used to analyze the performance characteristics of various tests.
Results: Clinical signs and symptoms could not predict dengue positivity due to
lack of specific symptoms. The performance of IgM rapid test was found to be
lower than the ELISA method (53.5% agreement). The NS1 rapid and NS1 ELISA tests 
were comparable (89.2% agreement). Majority of the infections were caused due to 
DEN-2 serotype and phylogenetic analysis revealed all the sequenced DEN-2
serotypes belong to Genotype IV. Three sequences were deposited into NCBI GenBank
(GenBank accession number MW583116, MW579054 and MW579053).
Conclusion: Our comprehensive data suggests that NS1 ELISA and PCR are best used 
in the early phase of dengue infection (< 5 days post-onset of fever), whereas
IgM antibody detection is reliable only in the late phase. We also highlight the 
unreliable performance of rapid tests.
