When people think about hazards, the types that easily come to their mind include
natural hazards, such as earthquakes, tornados, and tsunamis, and manmade ones,
such as plane crashes, bomb explosions, and exposure to toxic industrial
chemicals. Disease outbreaks are a source of hazards that are often overlooked,
and the largely forgotten smallpox was an example of such disease. This article
provides a review of the emergency management practices that curtailed the
potentially devastating spread of smallpox at Meschede, Germany in 1970. Lessons 
that can be transferred to the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.
