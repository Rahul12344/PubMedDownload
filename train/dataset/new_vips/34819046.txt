BACKGROUND: NS5A and NS5B proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the main
targets of compounds that directly inhibit HCV infections. However, the emergence
of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) may cause substantial reductions in
susceptibility to inhibitors.
METHODS: Viral load and genotyping were determined in eighty-seven naïve
HCV-infected patients, and the amplified NS5A and NS5B regions were sequenced by 
Sanger sequencing. In addition, physicochemical properties, structural features, 
immune epitopes, and inhibitors-protein interactions of sequences were analyzed
using several bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: Several amino acid residue changes were found in NS5A and NS5B proteins;
however, we did not find any mutations related to resistance to the treatment in 
NS5B. Different phosphorylation and few glycosylation sites were assessed.
Disulfide bonds were identified in both proteins that had a significant effect on
the function and structure of HCV proteins. Applying reliable software to predict
B-cell epitopes, 3 and 5 regions were found for NS5A and NS5B, respectively,
representing a considerable potential to induce the humoral immune system.
Docking analysis determined amino acids involved in the interaction of inhibitors
and mentioned proteins may not decrease the drug efficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Strong interactions between inhibitors, NS5A and NS5B proteins and
the lack of efficient drug resistance mutations in the analyzed sequences may
confirm the remarkable ability of NS5A and NS5B inhibitors to control HCV
infection amongst Iranian patients. The results of bioinformatics analysis could 
unveil all features of both proteins, which can be beneficial for further
investigations on HCV drug resistance and designing novel vaccines.
