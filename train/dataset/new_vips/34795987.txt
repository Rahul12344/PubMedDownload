The aim of the study was to modernize the existing prognostic regression models
in the context of expanding knowledge about the new coronavirus
infection.Materials and Methods: The modification of models and the increase in
their predictive ability are based on collecting the available data from
international and Russian databases. We calculated the traditional descriptive
statistics and used the linear regression analysis for modeling. The work was
performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 and the R 3.6.0 (RStudio) software.
Results: Manifestations of the COVID-19 epidemic process in several countries
were studied; special attention was put to the number of deaths associated with
the infection. A significant proportion of severe cases were noted among patients
both in Russia and elsewhere. Considering that the disease incidence has reached 
its peak in China and Italy, we were able to improve the previously published
(Sovremennye tehnologii v medicine 2020, Vol. 12, No.2) regression models and to 
compare their performance. The first modified model is based on the absolute
increase in new cases of the infection: its regression coefficient is 0.16 (95%
CI 0.137-0.181). In the extended version of the updated model, we additionally
considered cases of aggravated COVID-19: the regression coefficients were 0.128
(95% CI 0.103-0.153) for model 2 and 0.053 (95% CI 0.029-0.077) for model 1.1;
p=0.0001.
Conclusion: Based on the most recent data (from January to May 2020) on the
incidence of COVID-19 in the world, we have developed more specific versions of
the basic and extended regression models of lethal outcomes. The resulting models
are optimized and extrapolated to the current epidemiological situation; they
will allow us to improve our analytical approach. For that purpose, data
collection is currently ongoing.
