Aphrocallistes vastus lectin (AVL) is a C-type marine lectin produced by sponges.
Our previous study demonstrated that genes encoding AVL enhanced the cytotoxic
effect of oncolytic vaccinia virus (oncoVV) in a variety of cancer cells. In this
study, the inhibitory effect of oncoVV-AVL on Hela S3 cervical cancer cells, a
cell line with spheroidizing ability, was explored. The results showed that
oncoVV-AVL could inhibit Hela S3 cells growth both in vivo and in vitro. Further 
investigation revealed that AVL increased the virus replication, promote the
expression of OASL protein and stimulated the activation of Raf in Hela S3 cells.
This study may provide insight into a novel way for the utilization of lection
AVL.
