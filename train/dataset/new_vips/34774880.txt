Despite the actual availability of COVID-19 vaccines to combat the pandemic, many
people are still vacillating in their decision to vaccinate. In this study, we
considered the effect of two relevant contextual issues on vaccination intention:
the number of people infected with COVID-19 is increasing, and the pace of
vaccination is gaining speed. Specifically, we hypothesized that having already
contracted SARS-CoV-2 (post-positive reluctance) could lead people to
underestimate the importance of vaccination. Moreover, as the number of
vaccinated people increases, more hesitant people could fall into the free-riding
intention category, benefitting from the immunity provided by others'
vaccinations. Vaccine hesitancy becomes more critical as the vaccination campaign
proceeds: at one point, it will be inevitable to deal with hesitant people. This 
study is part of a WHO Regional Office for Europe project and involved a
representative sample of 5006 Italians interviewed in January-February 2021. In
case of post-positive reluctance, both young age and female gender increase
vaccine hesitancy, while a high level of education reduces free-riding intention.
Considering post-positive reluctance and free riding, a protective effect on
hesitancy is associated with negative affective states, adherence to protective
behaviors, trust in health information sources, and resilience. In contrast,
increased vaccine hesitancy is associated with a high level of
conspiracy-mindedness and trust in media information sources. Recognizing and
studying the post-positive reluctance and the phenomenon of free-riding people
can help us to become more efficient in combatting the virus.
