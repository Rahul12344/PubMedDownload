OBJECTIVE: Estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among New York
City Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) healthcare workers during the first wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe demographic and occupational factors
associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers.
DESIGN: Descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study using a convenience
sample of data from SARS-CoV-2 serological tests accompanied by a demographic and
occupational survey administered to healthcare workers.
SETTING: A large, urban public healthcare system in NYC.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were employed by NYC H+H and either completed
serological testing at NYC H+H between 30 April 2020 and 30 June 2020, or
completed SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing outside of NYC H+H and were able to
self-report results from the same time period.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, stratified by key demographic and
occupational characteristics reported through the demographic and occupational
survey.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and twenty-seven survey respondents were included in
analysis. Participants had a mean age of 46 years (SD=12.19) and 543 (75%) were
women. Two hundred and fourteen (29%) participants tested positive or reported
testing positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG+).
Characteristics associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 serostatus were Black race
(25% IgG +vs 15% IgG-, p=0.001), having someone in the household with COVID-19
symptoms (49% IgG +vs 21% IgG-, p<0.001), or having a confirmed COVID-19 case in 
the household (25% IgG +vs 5% IgG-, p<0.001). Characteristics associated with
negative SARS-CoV-2 serostatus included working on a COVID-19 patient floor (27% 
IgG +vs 36% IgG-, p=0.02), working in the intensive care unit (20% IgG +vs 28%
IgG-, p=0.03), being employed in a clinical occupation (64% IgG +vs 78% IgG-,
p<0.001) or having close contact with a patient with COVID-19 (51% IgG +vs 62%
IgG-, p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore the significance that community factors and
inequities might have on SARS-CoV-2 exposure for healthcare workers.
