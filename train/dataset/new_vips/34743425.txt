INTRODUCTION: The current epidemiological situation dictates a detailed study of 
the effect of a new coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2) on various anatomical,
histological, physiological and biochemical parameters of the human body, which
has become an integral part of many medical research, including urology,
andrology, endocrinology.
OBJECTIVE: To study serum testosterone levels and testicular hemodynamics before 
and after infection with SARS-CoV-2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 patients were examined, before and after suffering
SARS-CoV-2 infection (who fell ill at the beginning of 2020). Average age 37.8
years (min=27, max=50). The level of total testosterone (s) in the blood serum
and hemodynamic parameters of the testicles (maximum and minimum blood flow
velocity and resistance index) were studied.
RESULTS: When studying the level of s 3 months after the transferred SARS-CoV-2, 
its decrease from the initial value was noted (r=0.47; p=0.35), and after 6
months (r=0.98; p<0.007) there was no recovery of the target level of Ts before
infection with SARS-CoV-2. Regarding the hemodynamics of the testicles, there was
also a decrease in Vmax and Vmin, and an increase in RI, which indicates a
deterioration in the blood flow of the testicles (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 affects the level of Ts in the blood serum and the
parameters of the hemodynamics of the testicles. The extent to which SARS-CoV-2
affects patient performance depends largely on the severity of the disease and to
a lesser extent on baseline performance.
