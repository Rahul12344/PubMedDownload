Krabbe Disease (KD) is an autosomal metabolic disorder that affects both the
central and peripheral nervous systems. It is caused by a functional deficiency
of the lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase (GALC), resulting in an
accumulation of the toxic metabolite, psychosine. Psychosine accumulation affects
many different cellular pathways, leading to severe demyelination. Although there
is currently no effective therapy for Krabbe disease, recent gene therapy-based
approaches in animal models have indicated a promising outlook for clinical
treatment. This review highlights recent findings in the pathogenesis of Krabbe
disease, and evaluates AAV-based gene therapy as a promising strategy for
treating this devastating pediatric disease.
