Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in various body fluids. Its presence
in semen has been tested with contradictory results. This study aimed to detect
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus using the real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in semen and seminal plasma
from men with active COVID-19 infection.
Methods: In a cross-sectional study at a COVID facility, men aged 20-45 years
with active COVID-19 infection provided semen samples within 7 days of symptom
onset or 5 days of nasopharyngeal rRT-PCR test positivity in asymptomatic men.
Testing of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using rRT-PCR and semen analysis was done for
sperm counts and motility as per the WHO (2010) standards.
Results: A total of 37 men with a mean age of 32.2 ± 5.6 years were tested. SARS 
CoV-2 virus could not be isolated in any of the samples. Further, microscopic
analysis done on 17 samples showed normal semen parameters during the active
phase of disease.
Conclusion: Men with mild COVID-19 disease or asymptomatic individuals do not
shed virus in their semen, ruling out sexual contact as a mode of transmission in
this subset of population.
