INTRODUCTION: Neurological problems may be part of severe and early course of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 associated encephalitis as an
evident etiology of altered consciousness has been rarely reported in the
literature.
CASE REPORT: A case of 66-year-old female presented with classic COVID-19
symptoms and associated diabetic ketoacidosis. Although diabetic ketoacidosis was
managed, the patient had persistent impaired level of consciousness with
recurrent attacks of left focal fits because of COVID-19-associated encephalitis.
However, the patient has markedly improved after recovering from COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: Neurologists should be involved in the evaluation and management of
COVID-19 patients who present with associated neurological problems.
