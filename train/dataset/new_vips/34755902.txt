During COVID-19 infection, reduced function of natural killer (NK) cells can lead
to both compromised viral clearance and dysregulation of the immune response.
Such dysregulation leads to overproduction of cytokines, a raised
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and monocytosis. This in turn increases IL-6
expression, which promotes scar and thrombus formation. Excess IL-6 also leads to
a further reduction in NK function through downregulation of perforin expression,
therefore forming a pathogenic auto-inflammatory feedback loop. The
perforin/granzyme system of cytotoxicity is the main mechanism through which NK
cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate virally infected host cells, as well 
as being central to their role in regulating immune responses to microbial
infection. Here, we present epidemiological evidence suggesting an association
between perforin expression and resistance to COVID-19. In addition, we outline
the manner in which a pathogenic auto-inflammatory feedback loop could operate
and the relationship of this loop to genes associated with severe COVID-19. Such 
an auto-inflammatory loop may be amenable to synergistic multimodal therapy.
