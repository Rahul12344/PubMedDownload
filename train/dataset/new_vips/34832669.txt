(1) Background: There is a strong need for prevention and treatment strategies
for COVID-19 that are not impacted by SARS-CoV-2 mutations emerging in variants
of concern. After virus infection, host ER resident sigma receptors form direct
interactions with non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins present in the replication
complex. (2) Methods: In this work, highly specific sigma receptor ligands were
investigated for their ability to inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and 
virus induced cellular toxicity. This study found antiviral activity associated
with agonism of the sigma-1 receptor (e.g., SA4503), ligation of the sigma-2
receptor (e.g., CM398), and a combination of the two pathways (e.g., AZ66). (3)
Results: Intermolecular contacts between these ligands and sigma receptors were
identified by structural modeling. (4) Conclusions: Sigma receptor ligands and
drugs with off-target sigma receptor binding characteristics were effective at
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in primate and human cells, representing a
potential therapeutic avenue for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
