Background: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide public health
problem that has been known in China since December 25, 2019. Phospholipids are
structural components of the mammalian cytoskeleton and cell membranes. They
suppress viral attachment to the plasma membrane and subsequent replication in
lung cells. In the virus-infected lung, phospholipids are highly prone to
oxidation by reactive oxygen species, leading to the production of oxidized
phospholipids (OxPLs).
Objective: This study was carried out to explain the correlation between the
level of plasma phospholipids in patients with COVID-19 infection and the levels 
of cytokine storms to assess the severity of the disease.
Methods: Plasma samples from 34 enrolled patients with mild, moderate, and severe
COVID-19 infection were collected. Complete blood count (CBC), plasma levels of
D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
phospholipids, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)α2, and cytokine storms were
estimated, and lung computed tomography (CT) imaging was detected.
Results: The CBC picture showed the presence of leukopenia, lymphopenia, and
eosinopenia in patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, a significant
increase was found in plasma levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-13 as well as sPLA2α2 activity 
compared to normal persons. However, plasma levels of phospholipids decreased in 
patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection, as well as significantly
decreased in levels of triacylglycerols and HDL-C in plasma from patients with
severe infection only, compared to normal persons. Furthermore, a lung CT scan
showed the presence of inflammation in a patient with mild, moderate, and severe 
COVID-19 infection.
Conclusions: This study shows that there is a correlation between plasma
phospholipid depletion and elevated cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19
infection. Depletion of plasma phospholipid levels in patients with COVID-19
infection is due to oxidative stress, induction of cytokine storm, and systemic
inflammatory response after endothelial cell damage promote coagulation.
According to current knowledge, patients with COVID-19 infection may need to
administer surfactant replacement therapy and sPLA2 inhibitors to treat
respiratory distress syndrome, which helps them to maintain the interconnected
surfactant structures.
