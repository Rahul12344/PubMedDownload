Immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) is a noninvasive imaging method 
that enables tracking of immune cells in living animals. We used a nanobody that 
recognizes mouse CD8α and labeled it with 89Zr to image mouse CD8+ T cells in the
course of an infection with influenza A virus (IAV). The CD8+ signal showed a
strong increase in the mediastinal lymph node (MLN) and thymus as early as 4 days
post-infection (dpi), and as early as 6 dpi in the lungs. Over the course of the 
infection, CD8+ T cells were at first distributed diffusely throughout the lungs 
and then accumulated more selectively in specific regions of the lungs. These
distributions correlated with morbidity as mice reached the peak of weight loss
over this interval. CD8+ T cells obtained from control or IAV-infected mice
showed a difference in their distribution and migration when comparing their fate
upon labeling ex vivo with 89Zr-labeled anti-CD8α nanobody and transfer into
infected versus control animals. CD8+ T cells from infected mice, upon transfer, 
appear to be trained to persist in the lungs, even of uninfected mice. Immuno-PET
imaging thus allows noninvasive, dynamic monitoring of the immune response to
infectious agents in living animals.
