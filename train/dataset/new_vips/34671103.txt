Since the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak appeared in Wuhan,
mainland China on December 31, 2019, the geographical spread of the epidemic was 
swift. Malaysia is one of the countries that were hit substantially by the
outbreak, particularly in the second wave. This study aims to simulate the
infectious trend and trajectory of COVID-19 to understand the severity of the
disease and determine the approximate number of days required for the trend to
decline. The number of confirmed positive infectious cases [as reported by
Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH)] were used from January 25, 2020 to March 31, 
2020. This study simulated the infectious count for the same duration to assess
the predictive capability of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model.
The same model was used to project the simulation trajectory of confirmed
positive infectious cases for 80 days from the beginning of the outbreak and
extended the trajectory for another 30 days to obtain an overall picture of the
severity of the disease in Malaysia. The transmission rate, β also been utilized 
to predict the cumulative number of infectious individuals. Using the SIR model, 
the simulated infectious cases count obtained was not far from the actual count. 
The simulated trend was able to mimic the actual count and capture the actual
spikes approximately. The infectious trajectory simulation for 80 days and the
extended trajectory for 110 days depicts that the inclining trend has peaked and 
ended and will decline towards late April 2020. Furthermore, the predicted
cumulative number of infectious individuals tallies with the preparations
undertaken by the MOH. The simulation indicates the severity of COVID-19 disease 
in Malaysia, suggesting a peak of infectiousness in mid-March 2020 and a probable
decline in late April 2020. Overall, the study findings indicate that outbreak
control measures such as the Movement Control Order (MCO), social distancing and 
increased hygienic awareness is needed to control the transmission of the
outbreak in Malaysia.
