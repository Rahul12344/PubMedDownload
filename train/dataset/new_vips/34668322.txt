BACKGROUND: Age and obesity status are associated with severe outcomes among
hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. It remains unclear whether age and
obesity are risk factors for milder COVID-19 illness.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals. Participants
recorded symptoms for 28 days and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology. Type, number, and 
duration of symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 laboratory parameters were compared by age
and obesity status.
RESULTS: Of 552 individuals enrolled from June 2020 to January 2021, 470 (85.1%) 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 including 261 (55.5%) adults ≥18 years, 61 (13.0%)
adolescents 12-17 years, and 148 (31.5%) children <12 years. Children had fewer
symptoms (median 2 vs. 3, p < 0.001) lasting fewer days (median 5 vs. 7,
p < 0.001) compared with adolescents/adults. Body mass index of 300 (63.8%)
individuals classified with overweight or obesity (OWOB). Individuals with OWOB
suffered more symptoms compared with individuals without OWOB (median 3 vs. 2,
p = 0.037), including more cough and shortness of breath (p = 0.023 and 0.026,
respectively). Adolescents with OWOB were more likely to be symptomatic (66.7%
vs. 34.2%, p = 0.008) and have longer respiratory symptoms (median 7 vs. 4 days, 
p = 0.049) compared with adolescents without OWOB. Lower RT-PCR Ct values were
found in children and symptomatic individuals compared with adolescent and adults
and asymptomatic individuals, respectively (p = 0.001 and 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and adults with OWOB experience more respiratory
symptoms from COVID-19 despite similar viral loads. These findings underscore the
importance of vaccinating individuals with OWOB.
