Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) led to significant morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. A systemic hyper-inflammation characterizes severe
COVID-19 disease, often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Blood biomarkers capable of risk stratification are of great importance
in effective triage and critical care of severe COVID-19 patients. Flow cytometry
and next-generation sequencing were done on peripheral blood cells and
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and cytokines were
measured from and mass spectrometry-based proteomics was done on plasma samples
from an Indian cohort of COVID-19 patients. Publicly available single-cell RNA
sequencing data were analyzed for validation of primary data. Statistical
analyses were performed to validate risk stratification. We report here higher
plasma abundance of suPAR, expressed by an abnormally expanded myeloid cell
population, in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The plasma suPAR level was
found to be linked to a characteristic plasma proteome, associated with
coagulation disorders and complement activation. Receiver operator characteristic
curve analysis to predict mortality identified a cutoff value of suPAR at
1,996.809 pg/ml (odds ratio: 2.9286, 95% confidence interval 1.0427-8.2257).
Lower-than-cutoff suPAR levels were associated with a differential expression of 
the immune transcriptome as well as favorable clinical outcomes, in terms of both
survival benefit (hazard ratio: 0.3615, 95% confidence interval 0.1433-0.912) and
faster disease remission in our patient cohort. Thus, we identified suPAR as a
key pathogenic circulating molecule linking systemic hyperinflammation to the
hypercoagulable state and stratifying clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19
patients with ARDS.
