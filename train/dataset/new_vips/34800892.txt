The human body is inhabited by a large and complex network of commensal and
predatory eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages collectively termed the virome.
Despite being the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities on
the planet, the impact of viruses on human health especially within the female
reproductive tract (FRT) remains understudied. To better appreciate current
knowledge regarding the dynamic role of viruses in FRT health and disease, in
this review we highlight the known constituents of the FRT virome, transkingdom
interactions within the FRT and their influence on gynecological disease. A
better understanding of the FRT virome may pave the way toward improved outcomes 
in gynecological, reproductive, and neonatal health.
