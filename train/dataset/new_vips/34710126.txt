BACKGROUND: Despite the development and enforcement of preventive guidelines by
governments, COVID-19 continues to spread across nations, causing unprecedented
economic losses and mortality. Public places remain hotspots for COVID-19
transmission due to large numbers of people present; however preventive measures 
are poorly enforced. Supermarkets are among the high-risk establishments due to
the high interactions involved, which makes compliance with the COVID-19
preventive guidelines of paramount importance. However, until now, there has been
limited evidence on compliance with the set COVID-19 prevention guidelines.
Therefore, this study aimed to measure compliance with the COVID-19 prevention
guidelines among supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality
Uganda.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among selected supermarkets in
Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality in September 2020. A total of 229
supermarkets (195 in Kampala City and 34 in Mukono Municipality) were randomly
selected for the study. Data were collected through structured observations on
the status of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, and entered using
the KoboCollect software, which was preinstalled on mobile devices (smart phones 
and tablets). Descriptive statistics were generated to measure compliance to the 
set COVID-19 Ministry of Health prevention guidelines using Stata 14 software.
RESULTS: Only 16.6% (38/229) of the supermarkets complied with the COVID-19
prevention and control guidelines. In line with the specific measures, almost all
supermarkets 95.2% (218/229) had hand washing facilities placed at strategic
points such as the entrance, and 59.8% (137/229) of the supermarkets surveyed
regularly disinfected commonly touched surfaces. Only 40.6% and 30.6% of the
supermarkets enforced mandatory hand washing and use of face masks respectively
for all customers accessing the premises. Slightly more than half, 52.4%
(120/229) of the supermarkets had someone or a team in charge of enforcing
compliance to COVID-19 measures and more than half, 55.5% (127/229) of the
supermarkets had not provided their staff with job-specific training/mentorship
on infection prevention and control for COVID-19. Less than a third, 26.2%
(60/229) of the supermarkets had an infrared temperature gun for screening every 
customer, and only 5.7% (13/229) of the supermarkets captured details of clients 
accessing the supermarket as a measure to ease follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed low compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, which
required mandatory preventive measures such as face masking, regular
disinfection, social distancing, and hand hygiene. This study suggests the need
for health authorities to strengthen enforcement of these guidelines, and to
sensitise the supermarket managers on COVID-19 in order to increase the uptake of
the different measures.
