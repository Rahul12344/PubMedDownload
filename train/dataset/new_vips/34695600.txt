COVID-19 has swept globally and Pakistan is no exception. To investigate the
initial introductions and transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, we
performed the largest genomic epidemiology study of COVID-19 in Pakistan and
generated 150 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected before 
June 2, 2020. We identified a total of 347 mutated positions, 31 of which were
over-represented in Pakistan. Meanwhile, we found over 1000 intra-host
single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Several of them occurred concurrently,
indicating possible interactions among them or coevolution. Some of the
high-frequency iSNVs in Pakistan were not observed in the global population,
suggesting strong purifying selections. The genomic epidemiology revealed five
distinctive spreading clusters. The largest cluster consisted of 74 viruses which
were derived from different geographic locations of Pakistan and formed a deep
hierarchical structure, indicating an extensive and persistent nation-wide
transmission of the virus that was probably attributed to a signature mutation
(G8371T in ORF1ab) of this cluster. Furthermore, 28 putative international
introductions were identified, several of which are consistent with the
epidemiological investigations. In all, this study has inferred the possible
pathways of introduction and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which could
aid ongoing and future viral surveillance and COVID-19 control.
