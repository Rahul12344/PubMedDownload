Subspecialty surgical training is an integral part of continuous professional
development. It represents a unique opportunity for surgeons to enhance and
develop specific advanced skills in their sub-disciplines. Hence, hands-on
training in an international training centre abroad allows one to bring home new 
technical and management skills in the expansion of Malaysian surgical services
to raise to be on par with the international standards. The unexpected onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic brought in previously unknown hindrances to the training
both locally and abroad but our success in engagement with international centres 
despite the pandemic restrictions serves as a valuable experience towards
maintaining international networking for future collaborations.
