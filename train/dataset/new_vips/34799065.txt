BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In-person Objective Structured Clinical Examinations
(OSCEs) are used as assessments in most pharmacy programs, however, reports of
virtual OSCEs and skills assessments are limited. With a pivot to virtual OSCEs
necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider core
competencies assessed as well as logistics, technology, and other factors.
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: The virtual redesign of a Capstone OSCE for
third professional year pharmacy students at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic.
FINDINGS: Core components of pivoting an in-person Capstone OSCE to virtual
included an initial assessment of what was planned, what competencies were being 
assessed, and how this could be accomplished in the virtual realm. Key
stakeholders such as students, testing and evaluation services, and faculty were 
included in the planning process. In addition to changes in OSCE delivery,
grading processes and remediation were also modified.
SUMMARY: This Capstone OSCE merged virtual education and skills-based assessments
together out of necessity and provides an example of flexibility and nimbleness
in times of great change. Although further assessment is needed, processes used
and lessons learned are helpful for future, intentional planning of virtual or
partially virtual skills assessments.
