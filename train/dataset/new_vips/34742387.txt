Baculovirus-insect cell expression (BEV) has become one of the most widely used
eukaryotic systems for heterologous protein expression. The combination of
engineered baculovirus genomes together with a variety of compatible vectors,
robust insect cell lines, serum-free media and commercial kits have made it a
standard workhorse in many "non-virology-expert" laboratories. Despite these
significant improvements, the BEV system still has major drawbacks, primarily the
time required to amplify recombinant virus and its inherent instability. Here we 
present an easy-to-adopt simplified and shortened protocol.
