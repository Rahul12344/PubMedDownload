In order to prevent new pathogen outbreaks and avoid possible new global health
threats, it is important to study the mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis,
screen new antiviral agents and test new vaccines using the best methods. In the 
last decade, organoids have provided a groundbreaking opportunity for modeling
pathogen infections in human brains, including Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. ZIKV 
is a member of the Flavivirus genus, and it is recognized as an emerging
infectious agent and a serious threat to global health. Organoids are 3D complex 
cellular models that offer an in-scale organ that is physiologically alike to the
original one, useful for exploring the mechanisms behind pathogens infection;
additionally, organoids integrate data generated in vitro with traditional tools 
and often support those obtained in vivo with animal model. In this mini-review
the value of organoids for ZIKV research is examined and sustained by the most
recent literature. Within a 3D viewpoint, tissue engineered models are proposed
as future biological systems to help in deciphering pathogenic processes and
evaluate preventive and therapeutic strategies against ZIKV. The next steps in
this field constitute a challenge that may protect people and future generations 
from severe brain defects.
