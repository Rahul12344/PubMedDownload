The genus Protoparvovirus (family Parvoviridae) includes several viruses of
carnivores. We describe a novel fox protoparvovirus, which we named Newlavirus as
it was discovered in samples from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Analysis of 
the full non-structural protein (NS1) sequence indicates that this virus is a
previously uncharacterized species. Newlavirus showed high prevalence in foxes
from both the mainland (Labrador, 54/137, 39.4%) and the island of Newfoundland
(22/50, 44%) but was not detected in samples from other carnivores, including
coyotes (n = 92), lynx (n = 58), martens (n = 146), mink (n = 47), ermines (n =
17), dogs (n = 48), and ringed (n = 4), harp (n = 6), bearded (n = 6), and harbor
(n = 2) seals. Newlavirus was found at similar rates in stool and spleen (24/80, 
30% vs. 59/152, 38.8%, p = 0.2) but at lower rates in lymph nodes (2/37, 5.4%, p 
< 0.01). Sequencing a fragment of approximately 750 nt of the capsid protein gene
from 53 samples showed a high frequency of co-infection by more than one strain
(33.9%), high genetic diversity with 13 genotypes with low sequence identities
(70.5-87.8%), and no geographic segregation of strains. Given the high
prevalence, high diversity, and the lack of identification in other species,
foxes are likely the natural reservoir of Newlavirus, and further studies should 
investigate its distribution.
