Viral infections are among the most complex medical problems and have been a
major threat to the economy and global health. Several epidemics and pandemics
have occurred due to viruses, which has led to a significant increase in
mortality and morbidity rates. Natural products have always been an inspiration
and source for new drug development because of their various uses. Among
all-natural sources, plant sources are the most dominant for the discovery of new
therapeutic agents due to their chemical and structural diversity. Despite the
traditional use and potential source for drug development, natural products have 
gained little attention from large pharmaceutical industries. Several plant
extracts and isolated compounds have been extensively studied and explored for
antiviral properties against different strains of viruses. In this review, we
have compiled antiviral plant extracts and natural products isolated from plants 
reported since 2015.
