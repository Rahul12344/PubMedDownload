This debate examines the impact of infodemics - an over-abundance of information 
- on social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of its external
effects, social distancing behavior (SDB) shares fundamental properties with
public goods, whose potential for undersupply has been examined extensively in
the social sciences. Although the negative effects of infodemics have been
emphasized by governments and international organizations, theoretical models
suggest that infodemics may work as a mitigation mechanism. That is, infodemics
may enhance people's SDBs. Based on original survey data, we show that media
exposure can positively increase SDB. We conclude by discussing two public health
implications. First, the media plays an important role in motivating SDB. Second,
even if infodemics can increase SDB, we must be wary of their ability to pose
other, non-negligible dangers.
