OBJECTIVE: A positive relationship between the recently emerged Corona Virus
Disease-19 (COVID-19) and diabetes has been inferred, but not confirmed, in
children. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible impact of 
COVID-19 on new-onset Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in a pediatric population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of all children and adolescents
diagnosed with T1DM during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March
2020-February 2021) in Western Greece (population coverage ≈1,000,000). The
incidence and severity of T1DM, the age and sex of the participants and HbA1c and
c-peptide concentrations at diagnosis were recorded and compared to those of the 
previous year (pre-COVID-19 year).
RESULTS: 21 children aged 8.03±0.90 years old were diagnosed with T1DM in the
COVID-19 year and 17, aged 9.44±3.72 years old, in the pre-COVID-19 year. A
different seasonality pattern of new onsets was observed during the COVID-19 year
compared to the previous year, with increasing trend from spring to winter
(spring: 9.5% vs. 23.5%, autumn: 23.8% vs. 29.4%, summer: 19% vs. 11.8%, winter: 
47.6% vs. 35.3%). Also, compared to the preceding year, HbA1c was significantly
higher (p=0.012) and the incidence and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis greater 
(p=0.045, p=0.013, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report a different seasonality pattern
and increased severity of new-onset T1DM during the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic. Future research should further investigate the possible role of
SARS-CoV-2 and the different pattern of overall infection incidence during the
COVID-19 year.
