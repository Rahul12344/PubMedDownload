Purpose: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have exhibited
preeminent diagnosis and treatment performances, but their low internalization
severely limits predesigned functions. The low cell internalization is now an
urgent bottleneck problem for almost all nanomaterials. To achieve more
internalization of SPIONS, recombinant M13 phage was designed for targeted
delivery and smart release.
Methods: M13 phages were designed to co-express exogenous SPARC binding peptide
(SBP) and cathepsin B cleavage peptide (DFK), formed recombinant DFK-SBP-M13.
3.37± 0.06 nm of SPIONs were modified by 3, 4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (DHCA) 
to gain 10.80 ± 0.21 nm of DHCA-coated SPIONs, i.e., DHCA@SPIONs. Upon adjusting 
the proportions of DHCA@SPIONs and DFK-SBP-M13, the multi-carboxyl SPIONs
assembled onto recombinant M13 phages via covalent bonding. The assemblies were
co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells to interpret their internalization and smart
release.
Results: The "corn-like" SPIONs@DFK-SBP-M13 (261.47±3.30 nm) assemblies have not 
been reported previously. The assembly was stable, dispersible, superparamagnetic
and biocompatible. After co-cultivation with MDA-MB-231 cells, the
SPIONs@DFK-SBP-M13 assemblies quickly bond to the cell surface and are
internalized. The enrichment rate of SPIONs@DFK-SBP-M13 assembly was 13.9 times
higher than free SPIONs at 0.5 h, and intracellular Fe content was 3.6 times
higher at 1 h. Furthermore, the DFK peptides favored cathepsin B to cleave SPIONs
from the M13 templates resulting in release of SPIONs inside cells.
Conclusion: The novel SPIONs@DFK-SBP-M13 assembly can rapidly deliver SPIONs to
the targeted sites and enabled smart release. The combination of genetic
recombination and nanotechnology is beneficial for designing and optimizing some 
new nanomaterials with special functions to achieve wider applications.
