RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses represent a unique
class of processive nucleic acid polymerases, carrying out DNA-independent
replication/transcription processes. Although viral RdRPs have versatile global
structures, they do share a structurally highly conserved active site comprising 
catalytic motifs A-G. In spite of different initiation modes, the nucleotide
addition cycle (NAC) in the RdRP elongation phase probably follows consistent
mechanisms. In this chapter, representative structures of picornavirus RdRP
elongation complexes are used to illustrate RdRP NAC mechanisms. In the
pre-chemistry part of the NAC, RdRPs utilize a unique palm domain-based active
site closure that can be further decomposed into two sequential steps. In the
post-chemistry part of the NAC, the translocation process is stringently
controlled by the RdRP-specific motif G, resulting in asymmetric movements of the
template-product RNA. Future efforts to elucidate regulation/intervention
mechanisms by mismatched NTPs or nucleotide analog antivirals are necessary to
achieve comprehensive understandings of viral RdRP NAC.
