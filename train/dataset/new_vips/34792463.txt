The dominant narrative through the pandemic focused on the perils associated with
the transmission of COVID-19. This led to restrictive policies in long-term care 
that prevented family caregivers from being physically present to participate in 
their loved ones' care. There is growing evidence that such policies resulted in 
harm to residents, family members and staff. The path forward highlights the need
for balanced policies and practices to ensure that compassionate, person-centred 
and partnered care is not lost, whether in times of calm or crisis.
