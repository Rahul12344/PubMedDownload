The association between alcohol and liver disease, including alcoholic hepatitis,
cirrhosis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, has been
well described, but the same cannot be said for the association between smoking, 
water pipe or tobacco chewing. A review of cumulative evidence suggests that
smoking is independently a risk factor for liver fibrosis and contributes to
carcinogenesis in HCC. Smoking-related fibrosis has been reported in patients
with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis, alcoholic
liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis. Heavy smoking leads to systemic
inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and results in tissue
hypoxia, as well as free radical damage. Other than damaging the liver, patients 
also suffer from the systemic effects of the 4000 chemicals associated with
tobacco, which include nitrosamines, aromatic hydrocarbons, nicotine,
nornicotine, and other alkaloids. These include respiratory ailments, cancer of
the lungs, oral cavity, esophagus, pancreas and colon, atherosclerotic vascular
disease, and stroke.
