Context: The rapid outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become a significant global health 
concern, highlighting the dire need for antiviral therapeutic agents.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronavirus plays crucial roles in RNA
synthesis, and hence remains the druggable target for the treatment of this
disease. The most potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of viral RdRp are members of
nucleoside analogs (NAs). However, SARS-CoV-2 proved to be a challenging one for 
the novel NA drug designing strategy because coronavirus possesses an exonuclease
(ExoN) domain that is capable of excising NAs, thus showing resistance to
existing antiviral drugs.
Aim: The objective of our study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease (nsp14)
protein sequence of Wuhan-type virus with those of Indian SARS-Cov-2 isolates and
to study the effect of multiple mutations on the secondary structure alterations 
of proteins.
Subjects and Methods: Multiple-sequence alignment of exonuclease amino-acid
sequences followed by phylogenetic analysis and prediction of its secondary
structure of the protein was performed.
Results: Altogether, seven mutations were detected in the nsp14 of Indian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Subsequently, prediction of their secondary structures
revealed that mutations altered the structural stability of exonuclease proteins.
Conclusions: Present findings, therefore, further suggest that evolvability of
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily associated with the onset of multiple novel mutations
that rapidly spread at several new locations of the viral genome and also
provides important insight to develop specific control strategies to fight
against COVID-19 infections.
