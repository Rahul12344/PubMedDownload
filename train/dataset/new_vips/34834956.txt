Important lessons have been learned by the Israeli veterinary community regarding
Simbu serogroup viruses infections. This serogroup of viruses might cause the
births of neonatal malformation in susceptible ruminant's populations. Until
2012, only Akabane virus was connected with the births of malformed ruminants in 
Israel. However, serological and genomic detection tests, coupled with viral
isolations, revealed that more than a single Simbu serogroup serotype could be
present concurrently in the same farm or even in the same animal. From 2012 to
date, Aino, Shuni, Shamunda, Satuperi, Peaton, Schmallenberg, and Sango viruses
have been found in Israel either by serological or genomic investigation. Israel 
is located in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, a terrestrial and climatic bridge 
between the three old continents. The Eastern Mediterranean shores benefit from
both the tropical/subtropical and the continental climatic conditions. Therefore,
the Eastern Mediterranean basin might serve as an optimal investigatory compound 
for several arboviral diseases, acting as a sentinel. This review summarizes
updated information related to the presence of Simbu serogroup viruses in Israel.
