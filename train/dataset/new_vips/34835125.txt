A cytokine storm is an abnormal discharge of soluble mediators following an
inappropriate inflammatory response that leads to immunopathological events.
Cytokine storms can occur after severe infections as well as in non-infectious
situations where inflammatory cytokine responses are initiated, then exaggerated,
but fail to return to homeostasis. Neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and
natural killer cells are among the innate leukocytes that contribute to the
pathogenesis of cytokine storms. Neutrophils participate as mediators of
inflammation and have roles in promoting homeostatic conditions following
pathological inflammation. This review highlights the advances in understanding
the mechanisms governing neutrophilic inflammation against viral and bacterial
pathogens, in cancers, and in autoimmune diseases, and how neutrophils could
influence the development of cytokine storm syndromes. Evidence for the
destructive potential of neutrophils in their capacity to contribute to the onset
of cytokine storm syndromes is presented across a multitude of clinical
scenarios. Further, a variety of potential therapeutic strategies that target
neutrophils are discussed in the context of suppressing multiple inflammatory
conditions.
