We present the case of a 78-year-old African American man with a history of human
immunodeficiency virus diagnosed in 2007 who was newly diagnosed with pancreatic 
cancer. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed during the initial 
inpatient visit of pancreatic cancer diagnosis due to persistent dysphagia. Due
to PEG placement and the patient's wish to continue his previous antiretroviral
therapy, the patient crushed his fixed-dose bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir
alafenamide under the direction of a physician and has maintained virologic
suppression.
