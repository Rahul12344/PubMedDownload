Diagnostic testing that facilitates containment, surveillance, and treatment of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or future
respiratory viruses, depends on a sample collection device that efficiently
collects nasopharyngeal tissue and that can be manufactured on site when an
outbreak or public health emergency is declared by a government. Here two novel
stereolithography-based three-dimensional (3D)-printed nasopharyngeal swabs are
reported which are made using a biocompatible and sterilizable photoresist. Such 
swabs are readily manufactured on-site and on-demand to ensure availability, if
supply chain shortages emerge. Additionally, the 3D-printed swabs easily adapt to
current workflow and testing procedures in hospital clinical laboratories to
allow for effortless scaling up of test kits. Finally, the 3D-printed
nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrate concordant SARS-CoV-2 testing results between
the 3D-printed swabs and the COPAN commercial swabs, and enable detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples obtained from autopsies.
