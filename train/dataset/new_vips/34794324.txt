Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by insulin
deficiency and resultant hyperglycemia. Complex interactions of genetic and
environmental factors trigger the onset of autoimmune mechanisms responsible for 
development of autoimmunity to β cell antigens and subsequent development of T1D.
A potential role of virus infections has long been hypothesized, and growing
evidence continues to implicate enteroviruses as the most probable triggering
viruses. Recent studies have strengthened the association between enteroviruses
and development of autoimmunity in T1D patients, potentially through persistent
infections. Enterovirus infections may contribute to different stages of disease 
development. We review data from both human cohort studies and experimental
research exploring the potential roles and molecular mechanisms by which
enterovirus infections can impact disease outcome. Expected final online
publication date for the Annual Review of Medicine, Volume 73 is January 2022.
