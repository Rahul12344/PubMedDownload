The human and economic toll of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
and the unknowns regarding the origins of the virus, with a backdrop of enormous 
advances in technologies and human understanding of molecular virology, have
raised global concerns about the safety of the legitimate infectious disease
research enterprise. We acknowledge the safety and security risks resulting from 
the broad availability of tools and knowledge, tools and knowledge that can be
exploited equally for good or harm. The last 2 decades have shown us that the
risks are real. They have also shown us that more traditional top-down
regulations alone are not the answer. We encourage government to be thoughtful
and nuanced in dealing with this significant challenge and to carefully consider 
human factors and the important role of organizational-level leadership before
simply layering an additional bureaucratic burden on the enterprise without
understanding value and cost.
