Enteropathogenic parasites can infect a wide range of mammals, including humans, 
supposing an important zoonotic risk. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging
foodborne pathogen of increasing public health relevance, affecting both human
and animal populations. Because both microorganisms share faecal-oral
transmission route they may constitute an excellent model to evaluate the
interplay between them. Thus, we aim to evaluate the viral-parasite interactions 
at the enteric interface in swine. We included pigs of two different breeds
farming in South Spain under different production systems. We compared the HEV
prevalence by the presence of Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp.,
Balantioides coli, Blastocystis sp., and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in faecal
samples. The HEV prevalence was 13.1 (62 out 475, 95% CI: 10.2-16.4). Those pigs 
infected with Cryptosporidium spp. showed a higher prevalence of HEV (30.8% vs.
12%; p = 0.012). In the same way, animals bearing E. bieneusi seem to have a
higher rate of HEV infection (24.2% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.06). According to their
location in the gut, animals bearing intracellular enteroparasites showed a
higher HEV prevalence than those uninfected (29.6% vs. 12.7%; p = 0.038),
meanwhile those carrying extracellular enteroparasites had a lower likelihood to 
be infected by HEV than those uninfected (12.1% vs. 23.1%; p = 0.071). Those
animals bearing both type of enteroparasites showed a similar prevalence of HEV
infection than those exhibiting negative for both (20.8% vs. 26.1%; p = 0.763).
Our study provides evidence that intracellular and extracellular enteroparasites 
modulate the susceptibility to HEV infection in pigs. Meanwhile, the presence of 
extracellular enteroparasites shows a protective effect on the risk of HEV
acquisition in swine, whereas intracellular enteroparasites seems to have the
opposite effect, favouring the HEV infection. This article is protected by
