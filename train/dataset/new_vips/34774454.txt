BACKGROUND: A barrier to HIV-1 cure rests in the persistence of proviral DNA in
infected CD4+ leukocytes. The high HIV-1 mutation rate leads to viral diversity, 
immune evasion, and consequent antiretroviral drug resistance. While
CRISPR-spCas9 can eliminate latent proviral DNA, its efficacy is limited by HIV
strain diversity and precision target cell delivery.
METHODS: A library of guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to disrupt five HIV-1 exons
(tat1-2/rev1-2/gp41) was constructed. The gRNAs were derived from a conseensus
sequence of the transcriptional regulator tat from 4004 HIV-1 strains. Efficacy
was affirmed by gRNA cell entry through transfection, electroporation, or by
lentivirus or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery. Treated cells were evaluated for
viral excision by monitoring HIV-1 DNA, RNA, protein, and progeny virus levels.
FINDINGS: Virus was reduced in all transmitted founder strains by 82 and 94%
after CRISPR TatDE transfection or lentivirus treatments, respectively. No
recorded off-target cleavages were detected. Electroporation of TatDE
ribonucleoprotein and delivery of LNP TatDE gRNA and spCas9 mRNA to latently
infected cells resulted in up to 100% viral excision. Protection against
HIV-1-challenge or induction of virus during latent infection, in primary or
transformed CD4+ T cells or monocytes was achieved. We propose that multi-exon
gRNA TatDE disruption delivered by LNPs enables translation for animal and human 
testing.
INTERPRETATION: These results provide "proof of concept' for CRISPR gRNA
treatments for HIV-1 elimination. The absence of full-length viral DNA by LNP
delivery paired with undetectable off-target affirms the importance of payload
delivery for effective viral gene editing.
