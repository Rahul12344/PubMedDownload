OBJECTIVES: Sleep disturbances are prevalent problems among human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. The recognition of comorbid sleep 
disorders in patients with HIV is currently hampered by limited knowledge of
sleep-related symptoms, sleep architecture, and types of sleep disorders in this 
population. We aimed to compare the differences in sleep-related symptoms and
polysomnography-based sleep disorders between HIV-infected persons and controls.
METHODS: The study evaluated 170 men with a Pittsburgh sleep quality index scores
greater than 5, including 44 HIV-infected men and 126 male controls who were
frequency-matched by sex, age (±3.0 years) and BMI (±3.0 kg/m2). For all
participants, an overnight sleep study using a Somte V1 monitor was conducted.
Differences in sleep-related symptoms and sleep disorders between HIV-infected
patients and controls were examined using t-tests or chi-square tests.
RESULTS: HIV-infected persons with sleep disturbances more often had
psychological disturbances (72.7% vs. 40.5%, p < 0.001) and suspected rapid eye
movement behavior disorder (25.0% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.01) than controls.
Sleep-disordered breathing was less common in HIV-infected persons than in
controls (56.8% vs. 87.3%, p < 0.001). The mean percentage of rapid eye movement 
sleep was higher among HIV-infected patients than among controls (20.6% vs.
16.6%, p < 0.001). Nocturia was more common in HIV-infected persons than in
controls (40.9% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological disturbances and sleep-disordered breathing can be
possible explanations of sleep disturbances in HIV-infected persons in whom
sleep-disordered breathing is notable. Further studies are warranted to examine
the underlying factors of rapid eye movement behavior disorder among HIV-infected
persons with sleep disturbances.
