Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are a major cause of
gastroenteritis epidemics in both children and adults. Stool samples were
collected from 113 Tunisian children with acute gastroenteritis in 2001 and 2002 
and were retrospectively tested for HuNoVs. Fifteen (13.2%) of the 113 samples
were positive for HuNoVs, all of which were genogroup II strains, and the
GII.4-2004/Hunter variant was predominant (67%). We reconstituted the temporal
circulation of HuNoV strains in central Tunisia between 2003 and 2012 using HuNoV
isolates reported in our previous studies. A comparative analysis showed a
dynamic change in the molecular profile of the HuNoV strains over a 12-year
period. We found that GII.4-2004/Hunter strains were circulating as early as June
2002 and that GIX.1[GII.P15] HuNoVs were already circulating four years before
this genotype was first reported in Japan in 2006. Our data suggest that epidemic
strains of HuNoV circulate for several years in the pediatric population before
becoming predominant. This study suggests that children from low-income countries
with poor sanitation may play a significant role in the molecular evolution of
noroviruses and the global emergence of new epidemic strains.
