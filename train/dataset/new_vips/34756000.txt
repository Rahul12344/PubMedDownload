Nephrology nurses face health and wellness challenges due to significant
work-related stressors. This survey, conducted online between July 24 and August 
17, 2020, assessed the psychological well-being of nephrology nurses in the
United States during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 393). Respondents reported
feeling burned out from work (62%), symptoms of anxiety (47% with Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] scores ≥ 5), and major depressive episodes (16% with
Patient Health Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2] scores ≥ 3). Fifty-six percent (56%) of
survey respondents reported caring for COVID-19 patients, and 62% were somewhat
or very worried about COVID-19. Factors, including high workload, age, race, and 
the COVID-19 pandemic, may partially explain the high proportion of nephrology
nurses who reported symptoms of burnout, anxiety, and depression.
