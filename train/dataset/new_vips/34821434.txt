OBJECTIVE: We studied regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen metabolism
(rCMRO2) in whole brain, white matter, gray matter, and lenticular nuclei in
people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) as well as HIV associated
neurocognitive disorder (HAND).
METHODS: Treatment-naive PLHIV underwent neurocognitive assessment and magnetic
resonance (MR) measurement of rCBF and rCMRO2 with repeat after 12 months of
anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Age-sex-matched controls underwent single MR
measurements. We compared rCBF and rCMRO2 amongst symptomatic, asymptomatic,
normal HAND and controls using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Longitudinal
analysis HAND worsening (≥1 category) was assessed after 12-months of ART and
correlated with rCBF andrCMRO2 measured by MRI using paired-sample t-test.
RESULTS: Thirty PLHIV completed baseline and 12-month assessments (29 with rCMRO2
measurement). At baseline HAND assessment, 13% had no cognitive impairment (NO), 
27% had Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI), 60% had Mild Neurocognitive
Disorder (MND), and none had HIV-associated dementia (HAD). At 12 months, 13% had
NO, 20% had ANI, 50% had MND, and 17% had HAD). . In those without HAND worsening
(N=21) rCMRO2 remained stable and in those with HAND worsening (N=8) rCMRO2
measurement declined from baseline to 12-months in white matter (2.05±0.40 to
1.73±0.51, p=0.03) and lenticular nuclei (4.32±0.39 to 4.00±0.51, p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In recently diagnosed PLHIV, we found no association between rCBF or
rCMRO2 and cognitive impairment at baseline. There was a reduction in rCMRO2 in
those with worsening of cognitive function at 12 months on ART. Reduction in
rCMRO2 may be a biomarker of cognitive decline in PLHIV.
