This study sought to investigate the risk factors of poor psychosomatic health
among students during the quarantine of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A survey was conducted on-line, on a sample of 1978 respondents in Poland. The
study was carried out towards the end of the summer 2020 semester. The
questionnaire used in the study was designed so that it allows for the
observation of the main risk factors which have an impact on the students' mental
health. Variance analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used to
determine the predictors of mental health problems. The results indicate that
average and high levels of psychosomatic disorders were observed among 61% of
respondents. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that an increase in the 
level of educational burnout, a decreased life satisfaction, and use of negative 
strategies of coping with stress, were accompanied by a deteriorated mental
condition of students. Moreover, it was observed that female respondents scored
higher on the scale of disorders in comparison to males.
