A proteome-wide study of the virus kingdom based on 1.713 million protein
sequences from 19,128 virus proteomes was conducted to construct an overall
proteome map of the virus kingdom. Viral proteomes encode an average of 386.214
amino acids per protein with the variation in the number of protein-coding
sequences being host-specific. The proteomes of viruses of fungi hosts (882.464) 
encoded the greatest number of amino acids, while the viral proteome of bacterial
host (210.912) encoded the smallest number of amino acids. Viral proteomes were
found to have a host-specific amino acid composition. Leu (8.556%) was the most
abundant and Trp (1.274%) the least abundant amino acid in the collective
proteome of viruses. Viruses were found to exhibit a host-dependent molecular
weight and isoelectric point of encoded proteins. The isoelectric point (pI) of
viral proteins was found in the acidic range, having an average pI of 6.89.
However, the pI of viral proteins of algal (pI 7.08) and vertebrate (pI 7.09)
hosts was in the basic range. The virtual 2D map of the viral proteome from
different hosts exhibited host-dependent modalities. The virus proteome from
algal hosts and archaea exhibited a bimodal distribution of molecular weight and 
pI, while the virus proteome of bacterial host exhibited a trimodal distribution,
and the virus proteome of fungal, human, land plants, invertebrate, protozoa, and
vertebrate hosts exhibited a unimodal distribution.
