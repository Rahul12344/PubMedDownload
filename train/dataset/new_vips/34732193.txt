BACKGROUND: Despite the abundance of clinical data available for Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19), little research on the psychological well-being of
breast cancer survivors has been published. We investigate the extent to which
self-compassion accounted for the association between psychological well-being
(depression, anxiety) and death anxiety in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied. Participants were recruited 
from three departments of oncology in Zanjan, Iran. Data were collected from 210 
breast cancer patients. Participants completed self-report measures. Pearson
correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship among the study
variables. Bootstrapping analyses were used to test the significance of indirect 
effects.
RESULTS: Correlational analyses revealed that depression and anxiety were
significantly and positively related to death anxiety (r = 0.77, p < 0.01;
r = 0.85, p < 0.01, respectively) and negatively to self-compassion (r = - 0.48, 
p < 0.01; r = - 0.53, p < 0.01, respectively). Bootstrapping analyses revealed
significant indirect effects of depression (β = 0.065, SE = 0.35, p < 0.03, 95%
CI [LL = - 0.0083, UL: - 0.1654]) and anxiety (β = 0.089, SE = 0.09, p < 0.04,
95% CI [LL = - 0.0247, UL: - 0.1987]) on death anxiety through self-compassion.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that self-compassion may be
considered as one treatment strategy to improve psychological well-being of
cancer patients in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
