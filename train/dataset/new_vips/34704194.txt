INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common bloodborne chronic
infection in the US. Following approval of highly effective, direct-acting
antivirals in 2014, the diagnostic and treatment rates for HCV infection in the
US have evolved. This study assessed the number of individuals with HCV screening
or diagnostic testing and the clinical characteristics and treatment of
HCV-infected individuals between 2017 and 2019.
METHODS: Individuals screened for HCV antibody and/or tested for HCV ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) from 2017 to 2019 by two large US laboratory companies were included
in this analysis. Clinical characteristics, such as HCV genotype, fibrosis stage,
HIV coinfection and demographics, were assessed in HCV RNA-positive individuals. 
HCV treatment and subsequent achievement of sustained virologic response were
imputed using data-driven algorithms based on successive viral load decline and
negativity.
RESULTS: From 2017 to 2019, the number of individuals tested for HCV antibody
increased by 5.7%, from 7,580,303 in 2017 to 8,009,081 in 2019. The percentage of
individuals tested who were HCV antibody positive was stable, ranging from 5.0%
in 2017 to 4.9% in 2018 and 2019. The number of HCV RNA-positive individuals
decreased by 5.0% from 382,500 in 2017 to 363,532 in 2019. Of HCV RNA-positive
individuals, the proportions with genotype (GT) 3 and minimal fibrosis increased 
over time; proportions of individuals aged < 40 years increased, while the
proportion aged 50 to 59 years decreased. Treatment rates increased from 23.4% in
2017 to 26.8% in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of HCV antibody-positive individuals remained stable 
from 2017 to 2019. The number of individuals tested HCV RNA positive decreased
over the years. Demographics shifted toward a younger population with less
fibrosis and higher rates of GT3. More than 70% of diagnosed individuals were not
treated during this interval, highlighting a need for unfettered access to
treatment.
