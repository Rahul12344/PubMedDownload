The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly threatened the health and well-being of
humanity. Contact tracing (CT) as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention is
essential to containing the spread of such an infectious disease. However,
current CT solutions are fragmented with limited use of sensing and computing
technologies in a scalable framework. These issues can be well addressed with the
use of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Therefore, we need to overview 
the principle, motivation, and architecture for a generic IoT-based CT system
(IoT-CTS). A novel architecture for IoT-CTS solutions is proposed with the
consideration of peer-to-peer and object-to-peer contact events, as well as the
discussion on key topics, such as an overview of applicable sensors for CT needs 
arising from the COVID-19 transmission methods. The proposed IoT-CTS architecture
aims to holistically utilize essential sensing mechanisms with the analysis of
widely adopted privacy-preserving techniques. With the use of generic
peer-to-peer and object-to-peer sensors based on proximity and environment
sensing mechanisms, the infectious cases with self-directed strategies can be
effectively reduced. Some open research directions are presented in the end.
