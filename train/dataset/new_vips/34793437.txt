Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
COVID-19, is of zoonotic origin. Evolutionary analyses assessing whether
coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 infected ancestral species of modern-day
animal hosts could be useful in identifying additional reservoirs of potentially 
dangerous coronaviruses. We reasoned that if a clade of species has been
repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may
exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform
comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover
evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid
substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface,
whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian
clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze
aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that
causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates. Altogether,
our results suggest that the rodent and primate lineages may have had ancient
exposures to viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, respectively.
