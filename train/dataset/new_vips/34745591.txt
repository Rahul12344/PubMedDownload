Home testing is an emerging innovation that can enable nations and health care
systems to safely and efficiently test large numbers of patients to manage
COVID-19 and other viral outbreaks.  In this position paper, we explore the
process of moving home testing across the translational continuum from labs to
households, and ultimately into practice and communities for optimal public
health impact. We focus on the four translational science drivers to accelerate
the implementation of systems-wide home testing programmes 1) collaboration and
team science, 2) technology, 3) multilevel interventions, and 4) knowledge
integration. We use the Socio Ecological Model (SEM) as a framework to illustrate
our vision for the ideal future state of a comprehensive system of stakeholders
utilising tech-enabled home testing for COVID-19 and other virus outbreaks, and
we suggest SEM as a tool to address key translational readiness and response
questions.
