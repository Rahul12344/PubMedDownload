Esophagitis caused by Herpes Simplex virus is a well-recognized opportunistic
infection in the immunocompromised or severely ill host. However, it is uncommon 
in otherwise immunocompetent host. It usually responds well to a course of
acyclovir. We report a case of young female without any other immunocompromised
state who presented with severe dysphagia. She was diagnosed endoscopically and
later with histopathology and recovered well after a course of acyclovir.
