ABSTRACT: The present study is aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and
safety of tenofovir (TDF) and telbivudine (TBV) in interrupting hepatitis B virus
(HBV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and to provide evidence-based
treatment options to clinicians and patients.Hepatitis B e-antigen
(HBeAg)-positive pregnant women (644 in total) with high HBV DNA load
(≥2 × 105 IU/mL) and who received TDF (n = 214) or TBV (n = 380) in the second or
third trimester, or received no treatment (n = 50) were included in this
retrospective analysis.HBV DNA levels in mothers at delivery were significantly
lower than baseline in the 2 treatment groups. HBV DNA levels in the TDF group
were significantly different between the mothers receiving treatment in the
second trimester and those receiving treatment in the third trimester; however,
significant difference was not observed in the TBV group. The proportion of
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive infants at the age of 7 to 12 months
in the TDF, TBV, and control groups were 0.00% (0/174), 0.30% (1/331), and 5.0%
(2/40) with a significant difference between the treatment groups and the control
group, but no difference between the TDF and TBV group (P > .05). However, no
serious adverse events were observed in infants and mothers of all groups.TBV and
TDF can effectively reduce the HBV DNA level and MTCT rate in pregnant women with
high HBV DNA load (≥2 × 105 IU/mL); both antiviral drugs are safe for infants and
mothers. Since TDF was more effective in reducing HBV DNA levels during the
second trimester, its use during the period is recommended to prevent HBV MTCT.
