Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) have long been recognized as critical viral pathogens
within the poultry industry, associated with severe economic implications
worldwide. This specific group of viruses is responsible for a broad spectrum of 
diseases in birds, and an increasing occurrence of outbreaks was observed in the 
last ten years. Since their first discovery forty years ago in South Korea,
twelve antigenically distinct serotypes of fowl adenoviruses have been described.
This comprehensive review covers the history of fowl adenovirus outbreaks in
South Korea and updates the current epidemiological landscape of serotype
diversity and replacement as well as challenges in developing effective broadly
protective vaccines. In addition, transitions in the prevalence of dominant fowl 
adenovirus serotypes from 2007 to 2021, alongside the history of intervention
strategies, are brought into focus. Finally, future aspects are also discussed.
