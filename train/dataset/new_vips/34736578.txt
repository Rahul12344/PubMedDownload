Health problems of women experiencing homelessness are driven either from the
usual background characteristics of this population, or from the homeless
lifestyle. Apart from poverty and unemployment, transition to homelessness is
often associated with substance abuse, history of victimization, stress, poor
mental health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Water insecurity can
undermine bodily hygiene and dental health, posing a greater risk of dehydration 
and opportunistic infections. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions like
heat waves and natural disasters increases morbidity, accelerates aging, and
reduces life expectancy. Nutrition-wise, a high prevalence of food insecurity,
obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies are apparent due to low diet quality and 
food waste. Poor hygiene, violence, and overcrowding increase the susceptibility 
of these women to communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted ones and 
COVID-19. Furthermore, established cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus
are often either undertreated or neglected, and their complications are more
widespread than in the general population. In addition, lack of medical screening
and contraception non-use induce a variety of reproductive health issues. All
these health conditions are tightly related to violations of human rights in this
population, including the rights to housing, water, food, reproduction, health,
work, and no discrimination. Thus, the care provided to women experiencing
homelessness should be optimized at a multidimensional level, spanning beyond the
provision of a warm bed, to include access to clean water and sanitation,
psychological support and stress-coping strategies, disease management and acute 
health care, food of adequate quality, opportunities for employment and support
for any minor dependants.
