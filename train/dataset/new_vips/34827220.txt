Despite decades of intensive research on bacteriophage lambda, a relatively
uncharacterized region remains between the exo and xis genes. Collectively,
exo-xis region genes are expressed during the earliest stages of the lytic
developmental cycle and are capable of affecting the molecular events associated 
with the lysogenic-lytic developmental decision. In Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
(STEC) and enterohemorragic E. coli (EHEC) that are responsible for food- and
water-borne outbreaks throughout the world, there are distinct differences of
exo-xis region genes from their counterparts in lambda phage. Together, these
differences may help EHEC-specific phage and their bacterial hosts adapt to the
complex environment within the human intestine. Only one exo-xis region protein, 
Ea8.5, has been solved to date. Here, I have used the AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold
machine learning algorithms to predict the structures of six exo-xis region
proteins from lambda and STEC/EHEC phages. Together, the models suggest possible 
roles for exo-xis region proteins in transcription and the regulation of RNA
polymerase.
