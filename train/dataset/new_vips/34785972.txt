A cooperative control strategy is proposed for the air conditioning (AC) system
and ventilation system to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and save the
energy of the AC system. This strategy integrates the dynamic model of the
AC-cabin system, infection risk assessment, model predictive control (MPC) of the
thermal environment inside the cabin, and ventilation control that considers
passengers' sneezing. Unlike other existing AC system models, the thermal-health 
model established can describe not only the system performance but also the virus
concentration and risk of COVID-19 infection using the Wells-Riley assessment
model. Experiments are conducted to verify the prediction accuracy of the
AC-cabin model. The results prove that the proposed model can accurately predict 
the evolution of cabin temperature under different cases. The cooperative control
strategy of the AC system integrates the MPC-based refrigeration algorithm for
the cabin temperature and intermittent ventilation strategy to reduce the risk of
COVID-19 infection. This strategy well balances the control accuracy, energy
consumption of the AC system, and the risk of COVID-19 infection, and greatly
reduces the infection risk at the expense of a little rise in the energy
consumption.
