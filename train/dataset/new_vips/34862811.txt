Despite their considerable prevalence, dynamics of hospital-associated COVID-19
are still not well understood. We assessed the nature and extent of air- and
surface-borne SARS-CoV-2 contamination in hospitals to identify hazards of viral 
dispersal and enable more precise targeting of infection prevention and control. 
PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medrxiv, and Biorxiv were searched for
relevant articles until June 1, 2021. In total, 51 observational cross-sectional 
studies comprising 6258 samples were included. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one
in six air and surface samples throughout the hospital and up to 7.62 m away from
the nearest patients. The highest detection rates and viral concentrations were
reported from patient areas. The most frequently and heavily contaminated types
of surfaces comprised air outlets and hospital floors. Viable virus was recovered
from the air and fomites. Among size-fractionated air samples, only fine aerosols
contained viable virus. Aerosol-generating procedures significantly increased
(ORair  = 2.56 (1.46-4.51); ORsurface  = 1.95 (1.27-2.99)), whereas patient
masking significantly decreased air- and surface-borne SARS-CoV-2 contamination
(ORair  = 0.41 (0.25-0.70); ORsurface  = 0.45 (0.34-0.61)). The nature and extent
of hospital contamination indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is likely dispersed conjointly
through several transmission routes, including short- and long-range aerosol,
droplet, and fomite transmission.
