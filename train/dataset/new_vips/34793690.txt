During July 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
B.1.617.2 variant infections, including vaccine breakthrough infections, occurred
after large public gatherings in Provincetown, Massachusetts, USA, prompting a
multistate investigation. Public health departments identified primary and
secondary cases by using coronavirus disease surveillance data, case
investigations, and contact tracing. A primary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2
detected <14 days after travel to or residence in Provincetown during July 3-17. 
A secondary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2 detected <14 days after close contact 
with a person who had a primary case but without travel to or residence in
Provincetown during July 3-August 10. We identified 1,098 primary cases and 30
secondary cases associated with 26 primary cases among fully and non-fully
vaccinated persons. Large gatherings can have widespread effects on SARS-CoV-2
transmission, and fully vaccinated persons should take precautions, such as
masking, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly during substantial or
high transmission.
