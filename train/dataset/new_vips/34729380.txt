Preclinical studies on gene delivery into mouse lymphocytes are often hampered by
insufficient activity of lentiviral (LV) and adeno-associated vectors (AAVs) as
well as missing tools for cell type selectivity when considering in vivo gene
therapy. Here, we selected designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) binding to 
murine CD8. The top-performing DARPin was displayed as targeting ligand on both
vector systems. When used on engineered measles virus (MV) glycoproteins, the
resulting mCD8-LV transduced CD8+ mouse lymphocytes with near-absolute (>99%)
selectivity. Despite its lower functional titer, mCD8-LV achieved 4-fold higher
gene delivery to CD8+ cells than conventional VSV-LV when added to whole mouse
blood. Addition of mCD8-LV encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific
for mouse CD19 to splenocytes resulted in elimination of B lymphocytes and
lymphoma cells. For display on AAV, the DARPin was inserted into the GH2-GH3 loop
of the AAV2 capsid protein VP1, resulting in a DARPin-targeted AAV we termed
DART-AAV. Stocks of mCD8-AAV contained similar genome copies as AAV2 but were
>20-fold more active in gene delivery in mouse splenocytes, while exhibiting >99%
specificity for CD8+ cells. These results suggest that receptor targeting can
overcome blocks in transduction of mouse splenocytes.
