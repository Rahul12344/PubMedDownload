BACKGROUND: Hainan province is a very popular leisure tourist arriving city in
China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China and rapidly in early 
2020, and due to its rapid worldwide spread, the World Health Organization
declared COVID-19 as a global emergency. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Hainan
province, many businesses and economies were influenced in this unexpected event,
especially in tourism.
METHODS: This study used 2 classical forecasting methods to predict the number of
tourists on Hainan Leisure Island from September to December in the second half
of 2020 and to summarize the COVID-19 fighting experience during the pandemic. In
addition, the Hainan government implemented epidemic control measures to resume
production and work, and promote new tourism measures to acquire superior
COVID-19 protection.
RESULTS: Winter's method provides a statistical model for predicting the number
of visitors to Hainan under normal conditions. The trend analysis method
considers the impact of the black swan event, an irregular event, and only uses
the data under the influence of the event to predict according to the trend.
CONCLUSION: If the impact of the black swan event (COVID-19) continues, the
prediction can be made using this method. In addition, the Hainan government has 
undertaken timely and effective measures against COVID-19 to promote leisure
tourism development.
