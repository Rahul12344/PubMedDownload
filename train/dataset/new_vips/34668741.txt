The supply of testing equipment is vital in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
We compared the diagnostic efficacy and tolerability of molded plastic (FinSwab; 
Valukumpu, Finland) versus flocked nylon (FLOQSwab; Copan, Italy) nasopharyngeal 
swabs in a clinical setting. Adults (n = 112) with suspected symptomatic COVID-19
infection underwent nasopharyngeal sampling with FinSwab and FLOQSwab from the
same nostril at a drive-in coronavirus testing station. In a subset of 36
patients the samples were collected in a randomized order to evaluate the
discomfort associated with sampling. SARS-CoV-2 and 16 other respiratory viruses,
as well as human β-actin mRNA were analyzed by using reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) assays. Among the 112 patients (mean age, 38 [standard deviation (SD),
14] years) β-actin mRNA was found in all samples. There was no difference in the 
β-actin mRNA cycle threshold (CT) values between FinSwab (mean, 22.3; SD, 3.61)
and FLOQSwab (mean, 22.1; SD, 3.50; P = 0.46) swabs. There were 31 virus-positive
cases (26 rhinovirus, 4 SARS-CoV-2, and 1 coronavirus-OC43), 24 of which were
positive in both swabs; 3 rhinovirus positives were only found in the FinSwab,
and similarly 4 rhinovirus positives were only found in the FLOQSwab. Rhinovirus 
CT values were similar between swab types. Of the 36 patients, 22 (61%) tolerated
the sampling with the FinSwab better than with the FLOQSwab (P = 0.065). The
molded plastic nasopharyngeal swab (FinSwab) was comparable to the standard
flocked swab in terms of efficacy for respiratory virus detection and
tolerability of sampling. IMPORTANCE We demonstrate that a molded plastic swab is
a valid alternative to conventional brush-like swabs in collection of a
nasopharyngeal sample for virus diagnostics.
