Ibrutinib is a targeted therapy drug that blocks the activity of Bruton's
tyrosine kinase, and it is an approved treatment for several mature B-cell
malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Side effects include 
infections, cytopenia, nausea, and diarrhoea. In this report, we describe a case 
of hepatitis B reactivation in a female CLL patient undergoing treatment with
ibrutinib. Diagnosis was confirmed with highly elevated hepatitis B virus DNA and
a prior blood sample confirmed previous exposure. Ibrutinib was paused, and
antiviral therapy was initiated with prompt clinical improvement. Ibrutinib was
reinitiated shortly after clinical improvement. Thus, our case report
demonstrates that systematic HBV screening is essential before starting treatment
with ibrutinib. We suggest that antiviral prophylaxis is considered for patients 
at risk of reactivation, and ibrutinib may be continued following HBV
reactivation with proper antiviral treatment.
