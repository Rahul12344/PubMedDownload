"A World Upside Down": Experiences of Informal Caregivers During the COVID-19
Pandemic.

McLennon SM, Lekhak N.

The caregiving process may result in negative outcomes for caregivers. The
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed additional challenges for
family caregivers of older adults with chronic illnesses. Little is known about
the additional impact of the pandemic on caregivers. The purpose of the current
study was to understand the effects of the pandemic on the caregiving experience.
A qualitative descriptive content analysis was conducted on nine blogs of
caregivers of older adults. Blogs were identified using purposive sampling.
Bloggers were American, middle-aged, and caring for an older adult with dementia.
Caregivers reported "a world upside down" and change that contributed to
uncertainty; the need for support; and how isolation, depressive symptoms, and
threat contributed to negative psychological well-being. Managing and struggling 
in response to caregiving challenges and wishing for resolution were also
reported. Blogs of caregivers of older adults with chronic illness yielded
important information that may be useful to clinicians. [Journal of
Gerontological Nursing, 47(11), 11-14.].
