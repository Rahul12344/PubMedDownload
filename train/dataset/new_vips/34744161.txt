are autoimmune and not neutralizing.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity decreases the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG
antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. How obesity impacts the quality of 
the antibodies secreted, however, is not understood. Therefore, the objective of 
this study is to evaluate the presence of neutralizing versus autoimmune
antibodies in COVID-19 patients with obesity.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Thirty serum samples from individuals who tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR were collected from inpatient and outpatient
settings. Of these, 15 were lean (BMI < 25) and 15 were obese (BMI ≥ 30). Control
serum samples were from 30 uninfected individuals, age-, gender-, and
BMI-matched, recruited before the current pandemic. Neutralizing and autoimmune
antibodies were measured by ELISA. IgG autoimmune antibodies were specific for
malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and
for adipocyte-derived protein antigens (AD), markers of virus-induced cell death 
in the obese adipose tissue.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces neutralizing antibodies in all lean but
only in few obese COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection also induces anti-MDA
and anti-AD autoimmune antibodies more in lean than in obese patients as compared
to uninfected controls. Serum levels of these autoimmune antibodies, however, are
always higher in obese versus lean COVID-19 patients. Moreover, because the
autoimmune antibodies found in serum samples of COVID-19 patients have been
correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a general marker of
inflammation, we also evaluated the association of anti-MDA and anti-AD
antibodies with serum CRP and found a positive association between CRP and
autoimmune antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the quality of
the antibody response in COVID-19 patients with obesity, particularly the
presence of autoimmune antibodies, and identify biomarkers of self-tolerance
breakdown. This is crucial to protect this vulnerable population at higher risk
of responding poorly to infection with SARS-CoV-2 than lean controls.
