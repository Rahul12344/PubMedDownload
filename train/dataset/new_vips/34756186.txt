BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and 
spreading globally, including in populations with high vaccination rates. We
aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and
unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community.
METHODS: Between Sept 13, 2020, and Sept 15, 2021, 602 community contacts
(identified via the UK contract-tracing system) of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases
were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19
in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples
from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed
contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could
provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory
tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts
exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We
compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta
infection (n=29) with unvaccinated individuals with delta (n=16), alpha (B.1.1.7;
n=39), and pre-alpha (n=49) infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological 
analysis were to assess the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household contacts
stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases' vaccination status.
Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences 
in the peak viral load, viral growth rate, and viral decline rate between
participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status.
FINDINGS: The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25% (95%
CI 18-33) for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38% (24-53) in
unvaccinated individuals. The median time between second vaccine dose and study
recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals
(median 101 days [IQR 74-120]) than for uninfected individuals (64 days [32-97], 
p=0·001). SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases
was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25% [95%
CI 15-35] for vaccinated vs 23% [15-31] for unvaccinated). 12 (39%) of 31
infections in fully vaccinated household contacts arose from fully vaccinated
epidemiologically linked index cases, further confirmed by genomic and
virological analysis in three index case-contact pairs. Although peak viral load 
did not differ by vaccination status or variant type, it increased modestly with 
age (difference of 0·39 [95% credible interval -0·03 to 0·79] in peak log10 viral
load per mL between those aged 10 years and 50 years). Fully vaccinated
individuals with delta variant infection had a faster (posterior probability
>0·84) mean rate of viral load decline (0·95 log10 copies per mL per day) than
did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (0·69), alpha (0·82), or delta (0·79)
variant infections. Within individuals, faster viral load growth was correlated
with higher peak viral load (correlation 0·42 [95% credible interval 0·13 to
0·65]) and slower decline (-0·44 [-0·67 to -0·18]).
INTERPRETATION: Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and
accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless, fully vaccinated individuals with
breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and
can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully
vaccinated contacts. Host-virus interactions early in infection may shape the
entire viral trajectory.
