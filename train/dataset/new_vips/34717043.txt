Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from Leviviridae virions contain substantial 
amounts of cellular and plasmid-derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide
serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye thiazole
orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying
length, end-functionalized with TO, were loaded into VLPs up to approximately
50 % of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules 
per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO-PEG binding included a
significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid
pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20-120 hours following
simple reversible first-order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a
simple general method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of
functional molecules inside nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of
modifications to the capsid protein.
