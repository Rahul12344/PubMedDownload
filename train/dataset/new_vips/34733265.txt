The cationic proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin 26 (IL-26) shows antibacterial 
activity and inhibits the replication of cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus.
This study evaluates the early microbicidal activities of IL-26 against major
bacterial species including multi-resistant variants and Candida albicans.
Recombinant IL-26 was bacterially expressed and studied for its microbicidal
effects in culture. We show that IL-26 has strong 90% bactericidal activities
against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Acinetobacter baumannii. Similarly, IL-26 sensitivity was also detectable in
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and
carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii clinical isolates. Additionally, a significant,
albeit weak fungicidal effect against Candida albicans was observed. Activities
against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 
not detectable. The proinflammatory cytokine and kinocidin IL-26 shows strong
bactericidal activities against A. baumannii and, almost selectively, against
Gram-positive bacteria.
