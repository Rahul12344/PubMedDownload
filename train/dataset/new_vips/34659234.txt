T-cell antigen receptors (TRs) in vertebrates can be divided into αβ or γδ,
encoded by TRA/D, TRG, or TRB loci. TRs play a central role in mammal cellular
immunity, which occurs by rearrangement of V, D, J, and C genes in the loci. The 
bat is the only mammal with flying ability and is considered the main host of
zoonotic viruses, an important public health concern. However, at present, little
is known about the composition of bat TR genes. Based on the whole genome
sequence of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and referring
to the TR/IG annotation rules formulated by the international ImMunoGeneTics
information system (IMGT), we present a complete annotation of TRA/D, TRG, and
TRB loci of R. ferrumequinum. A total of 128 V segments, three D segments, 85 J
segments, and 6 C segments were annotated and compared with other known mammalian
data. The characteristics of the TR locus and germline genes of R. ferrumequinum 
are analyzed.
