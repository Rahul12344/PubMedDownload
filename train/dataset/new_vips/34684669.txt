BACKGROUND: Lockdown is an effective nonpharmaceutical intervention to reduce
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, but it restricts daily
activity. We aimed to investigate the impact of lockdown on pediatric body weight
and body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA)
statement. Four online databases (EMBASE, Medline, the Cochrane Library and
CINAHL) were searched.
RESULTS: The pooled results showed that lockdown was associated with significant 
body weight gain (MD 2.67, 95% CI 2.12-3.23; p < 0.00001). The BMI of children
with comorbidities or obesity did not change significantly. The BMI of general
population was significantly higher during lockdown than before the pandemic (MD 
0.94, 95% CI 0.32-1.56; p = 0.003). However, heterogeneity was high (I2 = 84%).
Among changes in weight classification, increases in the rates of obesity (OR
1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37; p = 0.0002) and overweight (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29; p 
= 0.001) were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed significant increases in body weight and
BMI during lockdown among school-age children and adolescents. The prevalence of 
obesity and overweight also increased. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the burden 
of childhood obesity.
