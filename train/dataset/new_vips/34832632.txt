The rapidly increasing Mediterranean aquaculture production of European sea bass 
is compromised by outbreaks of viral nervous necrosis, which can be recurrent and
detrimental. In this study, we evaluated the duration of protection and immune
response in sea bass given a single dose of a virus-like particle (VLP)-based
vaccine. Examinations included experimental challenge with nervous necrosis virus
(NNV), serological assays for NNV-specific antibody reactivity, and immune gene
expression analysis. VLP-vaccinated fish showed high and superior survival in
challenge both 3 and 7.5 months (1800 and 4500 dd) post-vaccination (RPS 87 and
88, OR (surviving) = 16.5 and 31.5, respectively, p < 0.01). Although not
providing sterile immunity, VLP vaccination seemed to control the viral
infection, as indicated by low prevalence of virus in the VLP-vaccinated
survivors. High titers of neutralizing and specific antibodies were produced in
VLP-vaccinated fish and persisted for at least ~9 months post-vaccination as well
as after challenge. However, failure of immune sera to protect recipient fish in 
a passive immunization trial suggested that other immune mechanisms were
important for protection. Accordingly, gene expression analysis revealed that
VLP-vaccination induced a mechanistically broad immune response including
upregulation of both innate and adaptive humoral and cellular components (mx,
isg12, mhc I, mhc II, igm, and igt). No clinical side effects of the VLP
vaccination at either tissue or performance levels were observed. The results
altogether suggested the VLP-based vaccine to be suitable for clinical testing
under farming conditions.
