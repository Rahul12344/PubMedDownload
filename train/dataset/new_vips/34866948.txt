Purpose: To identify potential risk factors for herpes zoster infection in type 2
diabetes mellitus in southeast Chinese population.
Patients and Methods: We built a model involving 266 herpes zoster patients
collecting data from January 2018 to December 2019. The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (Lasso) predictive model was used to test herpes zoster
virus risk using the patient data. Multivariate regression was conducted to
decide which variable would be the strongest to decrease the Lasso penalty. The
predictive model was tested using the C-index, a calibration plot, and decision
curve study. External validity was verified by bootstrapping by counting
probabilities.
Results: In the prediction nomogram, the prediction variables included age, sex, 
weight, length of hospital stay, infection, and blood pressure. The C-index of
0.844 (0.798-0.896) indicated substantial variability and thus the model was
adjusted appropriately. A score of 0.825 was achieved somewhere in the above
interval. Examination of the decision curve estimated that herpes zoster nomogram
was useful when the intervention was determined at the 16 percent of the herpes
zoster infection potential threshold.
Conclusion: The herpes zoster nomogram combines age, weight, position of the
rash, 2-hour plasma glucose, glycosuria, serum creatinine, length of the hospital
stay, and hypertension. This calculator can be used to assess the individual
herpes zoster risks in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
