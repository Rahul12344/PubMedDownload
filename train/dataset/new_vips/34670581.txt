BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic had immediate health and social impact, disproportionately affecting
certain socioeconomic groups. Assessing inequalities in risk of exposure and in
adversities faced during the pandemic is critical to inform targeted actions that
effectively prevent disproportionate spread and reduce social and health
inequities. This study examines i) the socioeconomic and mental health
characteristics of individuals working in the workplace, thus at increased risk
of COVID-19 exposure, and ii) individual income losses resulting from the
pandemic across socioeconomic subgroups of a working population, during the first
confinement in Portugal.
METHODS: This study uses data from 'COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion', a
community-based online survey in Portugal. The sample for analysis comprised
n = 129,078 workers. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the adjusted
odds ratios (AOR) of factors associated with working in the workplace during the 
confinement period and with having lost income due to the pandemic.
RESULTS: Over a third of the participants reported working in the workplace
during the first confinement. This was more likely among those with lower income 
[AOR = 2.93 (2.64-3.25)], lower education [AOR = 3.17 (3.04-3.30)] and working as
employee [AOR = 1.09 (1.04-1.15)]. Working in the workplace was positively
associated with frequent feelings of agitation, anxiety or sadness [AOR = 1.14
(1.09-1.20)] and perception of high risk of infection [AOR = 11.06
(10.53-11.61)]. About 43% of the respondents reported having lost income due to
the pandemic. The economic consequences affected greatly the groups at increased 
risk of COVID-19 exposure, namely those with lower education [AOR = 1.36
(1.19-1.56)] and lower income [AOR = 3.13 (2.47-3.96)].
CONCLUSIONS: The social gradient in risk of exposure and in economic impact of
the pandemic can result in an accumulated vulnerability for socioeconomic
deprived populations. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a double effect in
these groups, contributing to heightened disparities and poor health outcomes,
including in mental health. Protecting the most vulnerable populations is key to 
prevent the spread of the disease and mitigate the deepening of social and health
disparities. Action is needed to develop policies and more extensive measures for
reducing disproportionate experiences of adversity from the COVID-19 pandemic
among most vulnerable populations.
