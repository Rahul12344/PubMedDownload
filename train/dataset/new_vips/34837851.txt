BACKGROUND: Exercise can protect myocardial infarction (MI) and downregulate
cardiac Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2). However, the role of
HIPK2 in MI is unclear.
METHODS: HIPK2-/- mice and miR-222-/- rats, HIPK2 inhibitor (PKI1H) and
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) carrying miR-222 were applied in the
study. Animals were subjected to running, swimming, acute MI or post-MI
remodeling. HIPK2 inhibition and P53 activator were used in neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(hESC-CMs) subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Serum
miR-222 levels were analyzed in healthy people and MI patients that were survival
or readmitted to the hospital and/or died.
FINDINGS: Cardiac HIPK2 protein levels were reduced by exercise while increased
in MI. In vitro, HIPK2 suppression by lentiviral vectors or inhibitor prevented
apoptosis induced by OGD/R in NRCMs and hESC-CMs. HIPK2 inhibitor-treated mice
and HIPK2-/- mice reduced infarct size after acute MI, and preserved cardiac
function in MI remodeling. Mechanistically, protective effect against apoptosis
by HIPK2 suppression was reversed by P53 activators. Furthermore, increasing
levels of miR-222, targeting HIPK2, protected post-MI cardiac dysfunction,
whereas cardiac dysfunction post-MI was aggravated in miR-222-/- rats. Moreover, 
serum miR-222 levels were significantly reduced in MI patients, as well as in MI 
patients that were readmitted to the hospital and/or died compared to those not.
INTERPRETATION: Exercise-induced HIPK2 suppression attenuates cardiomyocytes
apoptosis and protects MI by decreasing P-P53. Inhibition of HIPK2 represents a
potential novel therapeutic intervention for MI.
