Abstract: For 27 years, national prospective data on selected rare childhood
diseases have been collected monthly by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance
Unit (APSU) from paediatricians and other clinical specialists who report cases
in children aged up to 16 years. We report here the annual results of APSU
surveillance in 2020 for ten rare communicable diseases and complications of
communicable diseases, namely: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); congenital
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection;
perinatal exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); paediatric HIV
infection; severe complications of seasonal influenza; juvenile onset recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP); congenital rubella syndrome; congenital
varicella syndrome; and neonatal varicella infection. We describe the results for
each disease in the context of the total period of study, including demographics,
clinical characteristics, treatment and short-term outcomes. Despite challenges
presented by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, more than 
1,400 paediatricians reported regularly to the APSU and an overall monthly
reporting rate of > 90% was achieved. The minimum AFP target of 1 case per
100,000 children aged less than 15 years was achieved and there were few cases of
vaccine-preventable diseases (JoRRP, rubella, varicella). However, high cases of 
congenital CMV, neonatal HSV and perinatal exposure to HIV persist. There were no
severe complications of seasonal influenza reported for the first time in 13
years. This is consistent with other surveillance data reporting a decline of
influenza and other communicable diseases in 2020, and likely reflects the wider 
effects of public health measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the
Australian community.
