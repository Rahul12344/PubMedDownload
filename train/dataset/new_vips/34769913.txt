OBJECTIVE: to describe a single-center experience of Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia (PJP) in non-HIV patients recovering from COVID-19.
METHODS: We report the cases of five non-HIV patients with COVID-19 who also
developed PJP at a University Hospital.
RESULTS: With the exception of one subject, who experienced an atypical and
prolonged course of COVID-19, all the patients developed PJP after the clinical
resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia. All but one patient had no pre-existing
immunosuppressive conditions or other risk factors for PJP development at
COVID-19 diagnosis. Nonetheless, following the course of COVID-19 infection, all 
the patients fulfilled at least one host factor for PJP; indeed, all the patients
had received at least 2 weeks of high-dose steroids and three out of five had a
CD4+ cell count <200/mm3.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 respiratory impairment seems
to be the most common risk factor for PJP, together with viral-induced and
iatrogenic lymphopenia. The worsening in respiratory function and the
characteristic radiological picture during or after COVID-19 pneumonia should
raise the suspicion of PJP, even in immunocompetent patients. PJP primary
chemoprophylaxis can be considered in selected high-risk COVID-19 patients, but
further studies are needed.
