BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are the second most frequent
diagnosis after Malaria amongst Outpatients in Uganda. Majority are Non pneumonia
cough and flu which are self-limiting and often do not require antibacterials.
However, antibiotics are continuously prescribed for these conditions and are a
major contributor to antimicrobial resistance and wastage of health resources.
Little is known about this problem in Uganda hence the impetus for the study.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibacterial prescribing rate and associated
factors among RTI outpatients in Mbarara municipality METHODOLOGY: This was a
retrospective cross-sectional study on records of RTI outpatients from 1st April 
2019 to 31st March 2020 (prior to the novel corona virus disease pandemic) in
four selected public health facilities within Mbarara municipality. A pretested
data caption tool was used to capture prescribing patterns using WHO/INRUD
prescribing indicators. We used logistic regression to determine factors
associated to antibacterial prescribing.
RESULTS: A total of 780 encounters were studied with adults (18-59 years) forming
the largest proportion of age categories at (337, 43.15%) and more females (444, 
56.85%) than men (337, 43.15%). The antibacterial prescribing rate was 77.6%
(606) with Amoxicillin the most prescribed 80.4% (503). The prescribing pattern
showed an average of 2.47 (sd 0.72) drugs per encounter and the percentage of
encounters with injection at 1.5% (24). Drugs prescribed by generic (1557, 79%)
and drugs prescribed from essential medicine list (1650, 84%) both not conforming
to WHO/INRUD standard; an indicator of possible irrational prescribing. Female
gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]:
(1.06-2.16); 18-59 years age group (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.09-2.33) and
Individuals prescribed at least three drugs were significantly more likely to
have an antibacterial prescribed (aOR= 2.72, 95% CI: 1.86-3.98).
CONCLUSION: The study found a high antibacterial prescribing rate especially
among patients with URTI, polypharmacy and non-conformity to both essential
medicine list and generic name prescribing. This prescribing pattern does not
comply with rational drug use policy and needs to be addressed through
antimicrobial stewardship interventions, prescriber education on rational drug
use and carrying out more research to determine the appropriateness of
antibacterial prescribed.
