BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the urgent need to discover effective
therapies for COVID-19 prompted questions about the ethical problem of
randomization along with its widely accepted solution: equipoise. In this scoping
review, uses of equipoise in discussions of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of
COVID-19 therapies are evaluated to answer three questions. First, how has
equipoise been applied to COVID-19 research? Second, has equipoise been employed 
accurately? And third, do concerns about equipoise pose a barrier to the ethical 
conduct of COVID-19 RCTs?
METHODS: Google Scholar and Pubmed were searched for articles containing
substantial discussion about equipoise and COVID-19 RCTs. 347 article titles were
screened, 91 full text articles were assessed, and 48 articles were included.
Uses of equipoise were analyzed and abstracted into seven categories.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Approximately two-thirds of articles (33/48 articles)
used equipoise in a way that is consistent with the concept. They invoked
equipoise to support (1) RCTs of specific therapies, (2) RCTs in general, and (3)
the early termination of RCTs after achieving the primary outcome. Approximately 
one-third of articles (15/48 articles) used equipoise in a manner that is
inconsistent with the concept. These articles argued that physician preference,
widespread use of unproven therapies, patient preference, or expectation of
therapeutic benefit may undermine equipoise and render RCTs unethical. In each
case, the purported ethical problem can be resolved by correcting the use of
equipoise.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the continued relevance of equipoise as it
supports the conduct of well-conceived RCTs and provides moral guidance to
physicians and researchers as they search for effective therapies for COVID-19.
