BACKGROUND: Socio-behavioural adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic may have
significantly affected adolescents' lifestyle. This study aimed to explore
possible reasons affecting changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour
in Indonesian adolescents during the pandemic based on mothers' perspectives.
METHODS: We recruited parents (n = 20) from the Yogyakarta region of Indonesia
(July-August 2020) using purposive and snowball sampling. Individual interviews
were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Data were imported into
NVivo software for a reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The interviews lasted between 38 and 113 min (M = 65 min). Participants'
age ranged between 36 and 54 years (M = 42.6 years). Participants' children
ranged in age from 12 to 15 years (M = 13.7 years, female: 9, male: 11). Themes
related to changes in physical activity during the pandemic were 1)
self-determination and enjoyment, 2) supports from others, and 3) physical
activity facilities and equipment. Themes related to changes in sedentary
behaviour during the pandemic included 1) educational demands, 2) psychological
effects due to the pandemic, 3) devices and internet availability, 4) parental
control, and 5) social facilitators.
CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, mothers perceived their children to be less
active and using more screen-based devices, either for educational or
recreational purposes, compared to before. The present themes might be useful
when developing interventions and policies promoting physical activity and
reducing sedentary behaviour in adolescents. Interventions could, for example,
consider increasing parents' and adolescents' awareness on current activity
guidelines, providing education on healthier recreational screen time, and
involving parents, peers, and teachers. Increasing the accessibility of physical 
activity facilities and equipment, making use of adolescents' favourite program
and social media for interventions, and providing activities that are fun and
enjoyable may also important.
