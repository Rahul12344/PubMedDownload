Rickettsial pathogens are amongst the emerging and re-emerging vector-borne
zoonoses of public health importance. Though traditionally considered to be
transmitted by ixodid ticks, the role of argasid ticks as vectors of these
pathogens is increasingly being recognized. While bat-feeding (Ornithodoros
faini) and chicken-feeding (Argas walkerae) argasid ticks have been shown to
harbor Rickettsia pathogens in Zambia, there are currently no reports of
Rickettsia infection in southern Africa from warthog-feeding (Phacochoerus
africanus) soft ticks, particularly Ornithodoros moubata and Ornithodoros
porcinus. Our study sought to expand on the existing knowledge on the role of
soft ticks in the epidemiology of Rickettsia species through screening for
Rickettsia pathogens in warthog burrow-dwelling soft ticks from two national
parks in Zambia. The tick species from which Rickettsia were detected in this
study were identified as Ornithodoros porcinus, and an overall minimal Rickettsia
infection rate of 19.8% (32/162) was observed. All of the sequenced Rickettsia
were identified as Rickettsia lusitaniae based on nucleotide sequence similarity 
and phylogenetic analysis of the citrate synthase (gltA) and 17kDa common antigen
(htrA) genes. Utilizing all of the gltA (n = 10) and htrA (n = 12) nucleotide
sequences obtained in this study, BLAST analysis showed 100% nucleotide
similarity to Rickettsia lusitaniae. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of
the Zambian gltA and htrA gene sequences could be grouped with those of
Rickettsia lusitaniae obtained in various parts of the world. Our data suggest
that Rickettsia lusitaniae has a wider geographic and vector range, enhancing to 
our understanding of Rickettsia lusitaniae epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa.
