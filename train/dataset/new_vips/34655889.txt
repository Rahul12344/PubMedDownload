Many of the inactivated viral vaccines for human and animal use are manufactured 
using formaldehyde as an inactivating agent. Apart from formaldehyde, Triton
X-100 is also one of the chemicals commonly used in viral vaccine manufacturing. 
Triton X-100 is typically used to extract the cell-associated viruses and / or
components during manufacturing process. The concentration of formaldehyde and
Triton X-100 in the final bulks are also reduced during vaccine purification
process. Here we report a simple RP-HPLC-UV based method for the quantification
of residual Triton X-100 and formaldehyde as process impurities in viral
vaccines. This method is also adopted for the residual impurity determination of 
either formaldehyde or Triton X-100 in other non-viral vaccines, multivalent as
well as sub-unit vaccines, such as liquid pentavalent, includes TT, DT, Hepatitis
B (rDNA) and Haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed). This method is
rapid and can quantify both Triton X-100 and formaldehyde in a single preparation
with improved peak asymmetry. This new assay has a linearity range starting from 
0.0625 to 1 µg/mL for formaldehyde and 0.625-10 µg/mL for Triton X-100. This
method would be very useful for viral vaccine manufacturing and release.
