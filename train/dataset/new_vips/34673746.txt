In the United States, 10% of HIV infections diagnosed in 2018 were attributed to 
unsafe injection drug use or male-to-male sexual contact among persons who inject
drugs (PWID) (1). In 2017, among PWID or men who have sex with men and who inject
drugs (MSM-ID), 76% of those who received a diagnosis of HIV infection lived in
urban areas* (2). To monitor the prevalence of HIV infection and associated
behaviors among persons who reported injecting drugs in the past 12 months,
including MSM-ID, CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) conducts
interviews and HIV testing among populations of persons at high risk for HIV
infection (MSM, PWID, and heterosexually active adults at increased risk for HIV 
infection) in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (3). The estimated
HIV infection prevalence among PWID in 23 MSAs surveyed in 2018 was 7%. Among
HIV-negative PWID, an estimated 26% receptively shared syringes and 68% had
condomless vaginal sex during the preceding 12 months. During the same period,
57% had been tested for HIV infection, and 55% received syringes from a syringe
services program (SSP). While overall SSP use did not significantly change since 
2015, a substantial decrease in SSP use occurred among Black PWID, and HIV
prevalence among Black PWID was higher than that among Hispanic and White PWID.
These findings underscore the importance of continuing and expanding HIV
prevention programs and community-based strategies for PWID, such as those
provided by SSPs, especially following service disruptions created by the
COVID-19 pandemic (4). Efforts are needed to ensure that PWID have low-barrier
access to comprehensive and integrated needs-based SSPs (where legally
permissible) that include provision of sterile syringes and safe syringe
disposal, HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and referrals to HIV and HCV
treatment, HIV preexposure prophylaxis, and treatment for substance use and
mental health disorders.
