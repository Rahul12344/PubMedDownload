Foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) is a picornavirus that causes a highly
contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals resulting in economic losses
worldwide. The 3C protease (3Cpro) is the main protease essential in the
picornavirus life cycle, which is an attractive antiviral target. Here, we used
computer-aided virtual screening to filter potential anti-FMDV agents from the
natural phytochemical compound libraries. The top 23 filtered compounds were
examined for anti-FMDV activities by a cell-based assay, two of which possessed
antiviral effects. In the viral and post-viral entry experiments, luteolin and
isoginkgetin could significantly block FMDV growth with low 50% effective
concentrations (EC50). Moreover, these flavonoids could reduce the viral load as 
determined by RT-qPCR. However, their prophylactic activities were less
effective. Both the cell-based and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET)-based protease assays confirmed that isoginkgetin was a potent FMDV 3Cpro 
inhibitor with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 39.03 ± 0.05 and 65.3 ±
1.7 μM, respectively, whereas luteolin was less effective. Analyses of the
protein-ligand interactions revealed that both compounds fit in the
substrate-binding pocket and reacted to the key enzymatic residues of the 3Cpro. 
Our findings suggested that luteolin and isoginkgetin are promising antiviral
agents for FMDV and other picornaviruses.
