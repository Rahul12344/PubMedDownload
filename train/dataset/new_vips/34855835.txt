BACKGROUND: We set out to assess the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
and micronutrient deficiency as indicated by serum retinol levels on the immune
responses to Oral Cholera Vaccine (Shanchol™) in a cohort of participants in
Lukanga Swamps, Zambia. Cholera remains endemic in Zambia with vaccines being the
only effective preventive measures. However, the effect of these vaccines on
populations living with HIV has not been widely documented.
METHODS: HIV testing and confirmation was done using the Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2
and Uni-Gold™ kits while vibriocidal antibody assay was applied for vaccine
immunogenicity. Serum retinol analysis was assessed by Shimadzu Prominence
HCT-2010 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The primary outcome was
log transformed geometric mean titre.
RESULTS: From 47 participants screened for HIV, 51% (24) tested positive. There
was a statistically significant reduction in Ogawa geometric mean ratio (GMR) by 
67% (GMR = 0.33; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.76; p-value = 0.009) attributable to HIV
positivity with a non-significant reduction in Inaba GMR by about 50% due to HIV 
positivity. When doubling of retinol levels modelled, GMR reduction against Ogawa
were non-significant but that against Inaba resulted in a significant reduction
in geometric mean titer (GMT) (GMT-0.33, C.I 0.16-0.66, p-value 0.002). At
1000copies/ml viral load cut off and 350 cells/μl CD4 counts, Ogawa GMT was two
times higher 11.16 (95%CI: 8.20-15.19) versus 6.06 (95%CI: 4.04-9.10) in low
viremia participants, and three times higher in above threshold CD4 count
participants; 24.81 (95%CI: 18.94-32.50) versus 7.07 (95%CI: 5.22-9.58).
CONCLUSION: Our results show that while Shanchol™ is immunogenic in both HIV+/-
individuals, HIV + participants responded poorly. Viral load and CD4 count
affected vaccine immunogenicity. More research is required for detailed
understanding of this in order to appropriately inform policy and practice.
