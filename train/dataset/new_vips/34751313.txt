In patients with severe COVID-19, it has been proposed as mechanism of
respiratory failure, intra and extrapulmonary shunt. However, there are no
reported or documented cases of this mechanism. Also, there are studies showing
this mechanism is not relevant. In this report, we present the case of a patient 
with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, who after two months, during his rehabilitation
period, presented persistent hypoxemia with orthodeoxia. Persistent oval foramen 
with shunt from right to left was diagnosed. The patient underwent a percutaneous
closure of the defect and at 48 hours oxygen therapy could be discontinued and
the patient discharged.
