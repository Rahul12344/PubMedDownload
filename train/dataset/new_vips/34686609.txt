The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B cells and is involved in the
development of B cell lymphomas. We report here that the viral noncoding RNA
EBER2 accelerates B cell growth by potentiating expression of the UCHL1
deubiquitinase that itself increased expression of the Aurora kinases and of
cyclin B1. Importantly, this effect was also visible in Burkitt's lymphoma cells 
that express none of the virus's known oncogenes. Mechanistically, EBER2 bound
the UCHL1 messenger RNA (mRNA), thereby bringing a protein complex that includes 
PU.1, a UCHL1 transactivator, to the vicinity of its promoter. Although the EBV
oncogene LMP1 has been suggested to induce UCHL1, we show here that EBER2 plays a
much more important role to reach significant levels of the deubiquitinase in
infected cells. However, some viruses that carried a polymorphic LMP1 had an
increased ability to achieve full UCHL1 expression. This work identifies a direct
cellular target of a viral noncoding RNA that is likely to be central to EBV's
oncogenic properties.
