BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has posed unforeseen circumstances and throttled major
economies worldwide. India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million
people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have
not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim for pan Indian cross-sectional evolutionary analysis
since inception of SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: High quality genomes, along with their collection date till 26th July
2021, were downloaded. Whole genome-based phylogeny was obtained. Further, the
mutational analysis was performed using SARS-CoV-2 first reported from Wuhan
(NC_045512.2) as reference.
RESULTS: Based on reported cases and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian
epidemic into seven phases. The average mutation rate for the pre-first wave was 
<11, which elevated to 17 in the first wave and doubled in the second wave (∼34).
In accordance with mutation rate, VOCs and VOIs started appearing in the first
wave (1.5%), which dominated the second (∼96%) and post-second wave (100%).
Nation-wide mutational analysis depicted >0.5 million mutation events with four
major mutations in >19,300 genomes, including two mutations in coding (spike
(D614G), and NSP 12b (P314L) of rdrp), one silent mutation (NSP3 F106F) and one
extragenic mutation (5' UTR 241).
CONCLUSION: Whole genome-based phylogeny could demarcate post-first wave isolates
from previous ones by point of diversification leading to incidences of VOCs and 
VOIs in India. Such analysis is crucial in the timely management of pandemic.
