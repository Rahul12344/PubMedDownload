BACKGROUND: Peer workers (those with lived/living experience of substance use
working in overdose response settings) are at the forefront of overdose response 
initiatives in British Columbia (BC). Working in these settings can be stressful,
with lasting social, mental and emotional impacts. Peer workers have also been
disproportionately burdened by the current dual public health crises
characterized by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and rise in illicit drug
overdose deaths. It is therefore critical to develop supports tailored
specifically to their realities.
METHODS: We used the six steps outlined in the Intervention Mapping (IM)
framework to identify needs of peer workers and design an intervention model to
support peer workers in overdose response settings.
RESULTS: Eight peer-led focus groups were conducted in community settings to
identify peer workers' needs and transcripts were analyzed using interpretive
description. The strategies within the intervention model were informed by
organizational development theory as well as by lived/living experience of peer
workers. The support needs identified by peer workers were categorized into three
key themes and these formed the basis of an intervention model titled 'ROSE'; R
stands for Recognition of peer work, O for Organizational support, S for Skill
development and E for Everyone. The ROSE model aims to facilitate cultural
changes within organizations, leading towards more equitable and just workplaces 
for peer workers. This, in turn, has the potential for positive socio-ecological 
impact.
CONCLUSIONS: Centering lived/living experience in the intervention mapping
process led us to develop a framework for supporting peer workers in BC. The ROSE
model can be used as a baseline for other organizations employing peer workers.
