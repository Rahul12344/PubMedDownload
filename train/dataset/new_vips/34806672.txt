INTRODUCTION: Clinical manifestations of dengue infection has a wide spectrum.
This study aimed to describe and compare the clinical aspects of dengue infection
in early childhood and those in older children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All dengue patients hospitalised at King Chulalongkorn
Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during 1987-2008 and aged 0-15 years were
included. All parameters were compared between patients in two groups: aged 0-2
years and >2-15 years.
RESULTS: Of the 2,221 children who were diagnosed with dengue, 179 were children 
aged 0-2 years compared with 2,042 children aged >2-15 years. The early childhood
group presented significantly more frequently with hepatomegaly, drowsiness,
diarrhoea, rash, convulsions, splenomegaly, and unusual manifestations. Dengue
fever (DF) was more common in the early childhood group and dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DHF) was less common. The mortality rate of the early childhood group was 
1.67%, which was significantly higher than that of the comparative group.
Approximately 65% of study subjects were serologically proven to have primary
infection, compared to 9.8% of older children.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations of dengue infection in early childhood are
different in some aspects from those of dengue infection in older children, and
mortality is higher. To effectively prevent dengue infection morbidity and
mortality in children, it is essential that clinicians correctly recognize and
diagnose dengue infection, particularly in early childhood.
