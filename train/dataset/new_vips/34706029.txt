OBJECTIVE: To reflect on the role of Brazilian nursing during the COVID-19
pandemic, considering as a historical landmark the bicentenary of the birth of
Florence Nightingale, a precursor of modern nursing, celebrated in 2020.
METHOD: Theoretical-reflective study, based on Florence Nightingale's
environmental theory through a literature review, carried out in international
and national virtual news from different sources and added to the authors'
experiences related to the pandemic.
RESULTS: It was possible to identify the weaknesses experienced by nurse
practitioners as to contagion by COVID-19, the routine of exposure to risks, the 
lack of adequate protection in many scenarios, the high rates of illness, and
also deaths that occurred in this profession.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Florence Nightingale's Environmental Theory describes the
importance of the adequacy of the work environment. It also emphasizes the value 
of this professional for contemporary nursing and the redefinition of this
professional category during the COVID-19 pandemic.
