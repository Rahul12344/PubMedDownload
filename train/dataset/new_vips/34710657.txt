With the outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19, the world health situation is
unprecedentedly severe. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune
disease, which can cause multiple organ damage. Numerous studies have shown that 
immune factors have important roles in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and SLE.
In the early stages of COVID-19 and SLE pathogenesis, IFN-α expression is
frequently increased, which aggravates the virus infection and promotes SLE
development. In addition, increased IL-6 levels, caused by different mechanisms, 
are observed in the peripheral blood of patients with severe COVID-19 and SLE,
stimulating a series of immune cascades that lead to a cytokine storm, as well as
causing B cell hyperfunction and production of numerous of antibodies,
aggravating both COVID-19 and SLE. In this review, we explore the background
immunopathological mechanisms in COVID-19 and SLE and analyze the advantages and 
disadvantages of commonly used SLE drugs for patients with COVID-19, to optimize 
treatment plans for patients with SLE who develop COVID-19.
