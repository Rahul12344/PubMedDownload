INTRODUCTION: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC), and provides a target for a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. CD137
ligand (CD137L) expressed on antigen presenting cells, costimulates
CD137-expressing T cells, and reverse CD137L signaling differentiates monocytes
to CD137L-DC, a type of DC, which is more potent than classical DC in stimulating
T cells.
METHODS: In this phase I study, patients with locally recurrent or metastatic NPC
were administered CD137L-DC pulsed with EBV antigens (CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX).
RESULTS: Of the 12 patients treated, 9 received full 7 vaccine doses with a mean 
administered cell count of 23.9 × 106 per dose. Treatment was well tolerated with
only 4 cases of grade 1 related adverse events. A partial response was obtained
in 1 patient, and 4 patients are still benefitting from a progression free
survival (PFS) of currently 2-3 years. The mean pre-treatment neutrophil:
lymphocyte ratio was 3.4 and a value of less than 3 was associated with prolonged
median PFS. Progressors were characterized by a high frequency of naïve T cells
but a low frequency of CD8+ effector T cells while patients with a clinical
benefit (CB) had a high frequency of memory T cells. Patients with CB had lower
plasma EBV DNA levels, and a reduction after vaccination.
CONCLUSION: CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX was well tolerated. The use of CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX is
demonstrated to be safe. Consistent results were obtained from all 12 patients,
indicating that CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX induces an anti-EBV and anti-NPC immune
response, and warranting further studies in patients post effective chemotherapy.
PRECIS: The first clinical testing of CD137L-DC, a new type of monocyte-derived
DC, finds that CD137L-DC are safe, and that they can induce an immune response
against Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma that leads to
tumor regression or prevents tumor progression.
