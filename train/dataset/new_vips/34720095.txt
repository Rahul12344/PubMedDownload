To explore how the immune system controls clearance of SARS-CoV-2, we used a
single-cell, mass cytometry-based proteomics platform to profile the immune
systems of 21 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection without need
for admission to an intensive care unit or for mechanical ventilation. We focused
on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected
cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK)
cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK
subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly
recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK
subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to
target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the
expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory
receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells.
Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the 
clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen
interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
