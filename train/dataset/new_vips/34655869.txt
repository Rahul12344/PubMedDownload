The COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on public health resources
around the world. From adversity, opportunities have arisen to measure the state 
and dynamics of human disease at a scale not seen before. In the United Kingdom, 
the evidence that wastewater could be used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus
prompted the development of National wastewater surveillance programmes. The
scale and pace of this work has proven to be unique in monitoring of virus
dynamics at a national level, demonstrating the importance of wastewater-based
epidemiology (WBE) for public health protection. Beyond COVID-19, it can provide 
additional value for monitoring and informing on a range of biological and
chemical markers of human health. A discussion of measurement uncertainty
associated with surveillance of wastewater, focusing on lessons-learned from the 
UK programmes monitoring COVID-19 is presented, showing that sources of
uncertainty impacting measurement quality and interpretation of data for public
health decision-making, are varied and complex. While some factors remain poorly 
understood, we present approaches taken by the UK programmes to manage and
mitigate the more tractable sources of uncertainty. This work provides a platform
to integrate uncertainty management into WBE activities as part of global One
Health initiatives beyond the pandemic.
