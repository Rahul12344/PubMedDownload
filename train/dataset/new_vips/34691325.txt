Viral diseases are some of the most common infections affecting humans. Despite
the unpleasant symptoms, most people return to their normal lives without
residual symptoms. Following the acute infectious phase of some viruses, however,
in some individuals symptoms may linger to the extent they are unable to return
to a normal lifestyle. Following coronavirus disease 2019 infection, significant 
numbers of patients continued to have symptoms that persisted for months after
hospital discharge. Symptoms spanned many organ systems and were prominent in the
pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. The exact mechanism is not clear. This
group of patients represents a new challenge to our health care systems. An
organized, multi-disciplinary approach and further research are warranted to be
ready to deliver better care to these patients.
