We previously screened the total nucleic acid extracts of 123 Mucor strains for
the presence of dsRNA molecules without further molecular analyses. Here, we
characterized five novel dsRNA genomes isolated from four different
Mucor&nbsp;hiemalis strains with next-generation sequencing (NGS), namely Mucor
hiemalis virus 1a (MhV1a) from WRL CN(M) 122; Mucor hiemalis virus 1b (MhV1b)
from NRRL 3624; Mucor hiemalis virus 2 (MhV2) from NRRL 3616; and Mucor hiemalis 
virus 3 (MhV3) and Mucor hiemalis virus (MhV4) from NRRL 3617 strains. Genomes
contain two open reading frames (ORF), which encode the coat protein (CP) and the
RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. In MhV1a and MhV1b, it is
predicted to be translated as a fusion protein via -1 ribosomal frameshift, while
in MhV4 via a rare +1 (or-2) ribosomal frameshift. In MhV2 and MhV3, the presence
of specific UAAUG pentanucleotide motif points to the fact for coupled
translation termination and reinitialization. MhV1a, MhV2, and MhV3 are part of
the clade representing the genus Victorivirus, while MhV4 is seated in Totivirus 
genus clade. The detected VLPs in Mucor strains were from 33 to 36 nm in
diameter. Hybridization analysis revealed that the dsRNA molecules of MhV1a-MhV4 
hybridized to the corresponding molecules.
