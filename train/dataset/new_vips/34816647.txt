The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has shown excellent clinical effectiveness; 
however, adverse events of the vaccine remain a concern in Korea. We surveyed
adverse events in 2498 healthcare workers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine at a university hospital. The survey was conducted using a diary
card for 7 days following each injection. The questionnaire response rate was
75.1% (1876/2498) for the first dose and 73.8% (1840/2493) for the second dose.
Among local reactions, pain was the most commonly reported (84.9% after the first
dose and 90.4% after the second dose). After the second dose, two people visited 
the emergency room due to severe local pain, but no hospitalization or skin
necrosis occurred. Among systemic reactions, fatigue was most frequently reported
(52.8% after the first dose and 77.0% after the second dose), followed by myalgia
(49.0% and 76.1%), headache (28.7% and 59.2%), chills (16.7% and 54.0%), and
arthralgia (11.4% and 39.2%). One or more critical adverse events occurred in
0.2% and 0.7% of the vaccinees. Except for urticaria, more adverse events were
reported after the second dose than after the first dose. In the future, adverse 
events should be investigated in older adults, and a future study with a longer
observation period should be conducted.
