Dengue replicons are powerful tools used in studying virus biology as well as in 
high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Replicon constructs are developed
as genomic (consists of all the viral protein genes) or sub-genomic (consists of 
only nonstructural protein genes) and are used to study various aspects of the
virus life cycle such as genome replication and virus assembly. In addition, a
replicon usually includes a reporter gene used in monitoring virus replication.
In this chapter, we provide methods to develop both genomic and sub-genomic
dengue replicons with a luciferase reporter and describe different assays to
utilize these systems.
