BACKGROUND: Long COVID-19 syndrome refers to the persistence of symptoms for more
than 12 weeks after the start of acute symptoms. The pathophysiology of this
syndrome is not yet clear.OBJECTIVE: To assess long COVID-19 symptoms in
hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was 
used. The study included 262 patients who were divided into two groups based on
their hospital admission history: 167 (63.7%) were not hospitalised, while 95
(36.3%) were hospitalised.RESULTS: Long-COVID was reported in 157 out of 262
patients (59.9%), and was significantly more frequent in non-hospitalised
patients (68.3% vs. 45.3%; P < 0.001). During the acute phase, hospitalised
patients had more respiratory symptoms (95.9% vs. 85.6%), while non-hospitalised 
patients had more neuropsychiatric symptoms (84.4% vs. 69.5%; P < 0.05).
Constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms were the most frequently reported
persistent symptoms in both groups, but all persistent symptoms were more
frequent in the non-hospitalised group (P < 0.005).CONCLUSION: Long COVID-19
symptoms affect both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients. Neuropsychiatric
manifestations were the most common persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Rehabilitation 
and psychotherapy could be advised for all recovered COVID-19 patients.
Non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients should be counselled to contact healthcare
providers whenever needed.
