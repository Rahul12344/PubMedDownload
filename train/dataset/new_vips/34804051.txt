B cell-targeting strategies such as rituximab are widely used in B cell
hematologic malignancies, rheumatologic and musculoskeletal diseases and a
variety of autoimmune disorders. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how
exposure to anti-CD20 treatment profoundly affects B cell functions involved in
anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity and significantly impacts on the clinical and
serological course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, long term immunity and vaccine
responses. The data presented here suggest that the effects of B cell-depleting
agents on adaptive immunity should be taken into account for the proper selection
and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and to guide appropriate therapeutic
approaches and protective measures. Combination therapeutic strategies including 
immunotherapy in association with prolonged antiviral treatment may play a
decisive role in the setting of B cell immune deficiencies.
