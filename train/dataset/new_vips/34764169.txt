INTRODUCTION: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a dysregulated
immune response. Inflammatory monocytes and macrophages are crucial, promoting
injurious, proinflammatory sequelae. Immunomodulation is, therefore, an
attractive therapeutic strategy and we sought to test licensed and novel
candidate drugs.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CATALYST trial is a multiarm, open-label, multicentre, 
phase II platform trial designed to identify candidate novel treatments to
improve outcomes of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with usual care.
Treatments with evidence of biomarker improvements will be put forward for
larger-scale testing by current national phase III platform trials. Hospitalised 
patients >16 years with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia (confirmed by chest X-ray or CT scan, with or without a positive
reverse transcription PCR assay) and a C reactive protein (CRP) ≥40 mg/L are
eligible. The primary outcome measure is CRP, measured serially from admission to
day 14, hospital discharge or death. Secondary outcomes include the WHO Clinical 
Progression Improvement Scale as a principal efficacy assessment.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the East
Midlands-Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee (20/EM/0115) and given urgent
public health status; initial approval was received on 5 May 2020, current
protocol version (V.6.0) approval on 12 October 2020. The MHRA also approved all 
protocol versions. The results of this trial will be disseminated through
national and international presentations and peer-reviewed publications.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: EudraCT2020-001684-89, ISRCTN40580903.
