Stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of non-essential businesses are powerful, but
socially costly, tools to control the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Mass testing
strategies, which rely on widely administered frequent and rapid diagnostics to
identify and isolate infected individuals, could be a potentially less disruptive
management strategy, particularly where vaccine access is limited. In this paper,
we assess the extent to which mass testing and isolation strategies can reduce
reliance on socially costly non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as distancing 
and shutdowns. We develop a multi-compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission 
incorporating both preventative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and
testing and isolation to evaluate their combined effect on public health
outcomes. Our model is designed to be a policy-guiding tool that captures
important realities of the testing system, including constraints on test
administration and non-random testing allocation. We show how strategic changes
in the characteristics of the testing system, including test administration, test
delays, and test sensitivity, can reduce reliance on preventative NPIs without
compromising public health outcomes in the future. The lowest NPI levels are
possible only when many tests are administered and test delays are short, given
limited immunity in the population. Reducing reliance on NPIs is highly dependent
on the ability of a testing program to identify and isolate unreported,
asymptomatic infections. Changes in NPIs, including the intensity of lockdowns
and stay at home orders, should be coordinated with increases in testing to
ensure epidemic control; otherwise small additional lifting of these NPIs can
lead to dramatic increases in infections, hospitalizations and deaths.
Importantly, our results can be used to guide ramp-up of testing capacity in
outbreak settings, allow for the flexible design of combined interventions based 
on social context, and inform future cost-benefit analyses to identify efficient 
pandemic management strategies.
