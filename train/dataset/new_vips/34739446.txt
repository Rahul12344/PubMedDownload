OBJECTIVES: Despite having close contact with the general public, members of the 
San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) reported relatively few cases of COVID-19
during the first half of 2020. Our objective was to explore evidence for prior
undetected infections by conducting a seroprevalence survey, and to document both
risk and protective factors for prior COVID-19 infection.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed workplace practices and exposures of
SFFD personnel during the first 6 months of 2020 via questionnaire and documented
prior COVID-19 infections by serologic antibody testing using an orthogonal
testing protocol.
RESULTS: Of 1231 participating emergency responders, three (0.25%) had confirmed 
positive COVID-19 antibody results.
CONCLUSIONS: Safe workplace practices, community public health intervention, and 
low community infection rates appear to have been protective factors for
emergency responders in San Francisco during our study period.
