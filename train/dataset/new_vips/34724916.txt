BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a growing burden which affects
every part of the world, including developing countries. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) has varied etiology which can result from or complicate other NCDs such as 
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The growing prevalence of NCDs coupled with
the increasing age in most developing countries, has seen a marked increase of
CKD in these settings. CKD has been described as "the most neglected NCD" and
greatly affects the quality of life of patients. It also places a huge economic
burden on societies. However, few epidemiological data exist, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa. Assessment of the prevalence of albuminuria as a marker of
kidney damage and CKD progression and its main risk factors was thus needed in
Rwanda.
METHODS: This study analyzed data collected during the first STEPwise approach to
NCD risk factor Surveillance (STEPS) survey in Rwanda, conducted from 2012 to
2013, to assess the prevalence of albuminuria. A multistage cluster sampling
allowed to select a representative sample of the general population. Furthermore,
descriptive, as well as univariable analyses and multiple logistic regression
were performed to respond to the research question.
RESULTS: This survey brought a representative sample of 6,998 participants, among
which 4,384 (62.65%) were female. Median age was 33 years (interquartile range,
IQR 26-44), and over three quarters (78.45%) lived in rural areas. The
albuminuria prevalence was 105.9 per 1,000 population. Overall, semi-urban and
urban residency were associated with lower odds of CKD (odds ratio, OR 0.36, CI
0.23-0.56, p<0.001 and OR 0.34, CI 0.23-0.50, p<0.001, respectively) than rural
status. Being married or living with a partner had higher odds (OR 1.44 (CI
1.03-2.02, p=0.031) and OR 1.62 (CI 1.06-2.48, p=0.026), respectively) of CKD
than being single. Odds of positive albuminuria were also greater among
participants living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (OR 1.64, CI 1.09-
2.47, p=0.018). Gender, age group, smoking status and vegetable consumption, body
mass index (BMI) and hypertension were not associated with albuminuria.
CONCLUSION: The albuminuria prevalence was estimated at 105.9 per 1,000 in
Rwanda. Rural residence, partnered status and HIV positivity were identified as
main risk factors for albuminuria. Increased early screening of albuminuria to
prevent CKD among high-risk groups, especially HIV patients, is therefore
recommended.
