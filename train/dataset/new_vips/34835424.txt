Novel human polyomaviruses (HPyV) have been recently identified in solid organ
transplant recipients. Trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS) is a rare disease
associated with immunosuppression and induced by a polyomavirus (TSPyV). We
report here a case of primary and disseminated TSPyV infection after kidney
transplantation with extensive skin lesions, sustained viremia, and high viral
loads in urine specimens, anal, nasal and throat swabs, assessed via specific
real-time PCR for TSPyV during a follow-up period of 32 months after
transplantation. The detection of TSPyV with a high viral load in respiratory and
anal swab samples is compatible with viral replication and thus may suggest
potential respiratory and oro-fecal routes of transmission.
