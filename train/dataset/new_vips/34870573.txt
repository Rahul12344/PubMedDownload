In this study, we performed genome-wide association analyses on SARS-CoV-2
genomes to identify genetic mutations associated with
pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Various potential covariates and
confounding factors of COVID-19 severity, including patient age, gender and
country, as well as virus phylogenetic relatedness were adjusted for. In total,
3021 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 generated from original clinical samples
and whose patient status could be determined conclusively as either
'pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic' or 'symptomatic' were retrieved from the GISAID
database. We found that the mutation 11â€‰083G>T, located in the coding region of
non-structural protein 6, is significantly associated with asymptomatic COVID-19.
Patient age is positively correlated with symptomatic infection, while gender is 
not significantly correlated with the development of the disease. We also found
that the effects of the mutation, patient age and gender do not vary
significantly among countries, although each country appears to have varying
baseline chances of COVID-19 symptom development.
