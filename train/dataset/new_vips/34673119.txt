Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory 
illness in young children worldwide. Whole genome sequencing of HRSV offers
enhanced resolution of strain variability for epidemiological surveillance and
provides genomic information essential for antiviral and vaccine development. A
10-amplicon one-step RT-PCR assay and a 20-amplicon nested RT-PCR assay with
enhanced sensitivity were developed to amplify whole HRSV genomes from samples
containing high and low viral loads, respectively. Ninety-six HRSV-positive
samples comprised of 58 clinical specimens and 38 virus isolates with Ct values ≤
24 were amplified successfully using the 10-amplicon one-step RT-PCR method and
multiplexed in a single MiSeq run. Genome coverage exceeded 99.3% for all 96
samples. The 20-amplicon nested RT-PCR NGS method was used to generate >99.6%
HRSV full-length genome for 72 clinical specimens with Ct values ranging from 24 
to 33. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequences obtained from the 130
clinical specimens revealed a wide diversity of HRSV genotypes demonstrating
methodologic robustness.
