BACKGROUND: The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of remdesivir for coronavirus
disease 2019 raised questions on transparency of applied strategy, and how to
equitably allocate and prioritize eligible patients given limited supply of the
medication. The absence of federal oversight highlighted the critical role by
states in health policymaking during a pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: To identify public state-based protocols for remdesivir allocation and
clinical guidance for prioritizing remdesivir use and assess approaches and
inclusion of language promoting equitable access or mitigating health
disparities.
METHODS: We identified remdesivir allocation strategies and clinical use
guidelines for all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia accessible 
on state health department websites or via internet searches. Public protocols
dated between May 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 were included in the study. We
reviewed strategies for allocation and clinical use, including whether protocols 
contained explicit language on equitable access to remdesivir or mitigating
health disparities.
RESULTS: A total of 38 states had a remdesivir allocation strategy, with 33
states (87%) making these public. States used diverse allocation strategies, and 
only 10 (30%) of the 33 states included language on equitable allocation. A total
of 30 states had remdesivir clinical use guidelines, where all were publicly
accessible. All guidelines referenced recommendations by federal agencies but
varied in their presentation format. Of the 30 states, 12 (40%) had guidelines
that included language on equitable use. Neither an allocation strategy or
clinical use guideline were identified (public or non-public) for 10 states and
the District of Columbia during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The experience with the remdesivir EUA presents an opportunity for
federal and state governments to develop transparent protocols promoting fair and
equal access to treatments for future pandemics.
