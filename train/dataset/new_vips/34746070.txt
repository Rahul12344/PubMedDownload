The aim of the present study is to apply the canine olfactory sensitivity to
detect COVID-19-positive axillary sweat samples as a One Health approach in Latin
America. One hundred volunteers with COVID-like symptoms were invited to
participate, and both axillary sweat samples for dog detection and
nasopharynx/oropharynx swabs for qPCR were collected. Two dogs, previously
trained, detected 97.4% of the samples positive for COVID-19, including a
false-negative qPCR-test, and the positive predictive value was 100% and the
negative predictive value was 98.2%. Therefore, we can conclude that canine
olfactory sensitivity can detect a person infected with COVID-19 through axillary
sweat successfully and could be used as an alternative to screen them without
invasive testing.
