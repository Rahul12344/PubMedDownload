On March 14, 2020, the first Bavaria-wide exit restriction was imposed and
university teaching in its familiar form was drastically restricted. For
intensive care physicians and anesthetists, there was a special area of tension
in many places due to the extraordinary demand for the treatment of critically
ill patients and the restructuring and maintenance of teaching. We report on the 
realignment of the anesthesia seminar in an online flipped classroom and the
development towards a hybrid model. As such, an adequate transfer of knowledge
could take place under difficult conditions and at the same time the teaching
concept could be further developed.
