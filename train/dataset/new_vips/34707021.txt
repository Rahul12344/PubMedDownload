The inhibitory activity of electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) against Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the etiological agent
responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was tested in vitro on Vero 
E6 cells using a plaque assay. Infectious virus titers of cells treated with ERW 
100%, 50% and 33.3% solutions and phosphate buffered saline (PBS, negative
control) and exposed to the virus suspension for 60 seconds were 2.25, 2.65, 3.21
and 7.38, respectively. ERW has a high pH and low surface tension. It is
considered that the alkaline property of ERW breaks down phospholipids and
proteins of envelopes. The role of pH and reducibility on the virucidal effect of
ERW should be further evaluated. This study provides a foundation for utilizing
ERW as an effective antiviral aqueous solution in a variety of applications.
