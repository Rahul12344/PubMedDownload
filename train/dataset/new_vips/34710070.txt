PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article will provide an overview of recent disruptions to
the otolaryngology residency match process and conclude with questions and
resources that can guide future selection system design.
RECENT FINDINGS: During the implementation of the single accreditation system,
the loss of osteopathic programs, reduction of osteopathic leadership positions, 
and lack of interest in Osteopathic Recognition represent serious threats to the 
profession; this has implications for the distribution of the otolaryngology
workforce, plausibly decreasing healthcare access in less-populated communities. 
Next, the impacts of COVID-19 reverberated throughout the application process,
including the reduction/elimination of away rotations, modification of
application requirements, conversion to virtual interviews, and initiation of
preference signaling. Soon, the transition to pass/fail scoring for the United
States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1 could stimulate a paradigm shift, with a
heightened emphasis on holistic review.
SUMMARY: The last two match cycles have been the most dynamic and unpredictable
in decades. Out of the commotion, the otolaryngology community has an opportunity
for a fresh start, combining insights from past literature with recent articles
compiled for this review. Moving forward, it will be advantageous to approach
residency selection as a well-executed quality improvement project, requiring
continuous assessment and adjustment.
