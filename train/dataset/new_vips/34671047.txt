Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic concerns were raised regarding infection of new 
animal hosts and the effect on viral epidemiology. Infection of other animals
could be detrimental by causing clinical disease, allowing further mutations, and
bares the risk for the establishment of a non-human reservoir. Cats were the
first reported animals susceptible to natural and experimental infection with
SARS-CoV-2. Given the concerns these findings raised, and the close contact
between humans and cats, we aimed to develop a vaccine candidate that could
reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and in addition to prevent spread among cats. Here we
report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus, known to be safe and efficacious in a variety of animal
species, could induce neutralizing antibody responses in guinea pigs and cats.
The design of the SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen was critical in developing a strong 
neutralizing antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce high
neutralizing antibody responses, effective also against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7
variant. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, the infectious virus
could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after
SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Correspondingly, the challenged control cats spread the
virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit the virus. 
The results show that the RP vaccine induces protective immunity preventing
SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. These data suggest that this RP vaccine
could be a multi-species vaccine useful to prevent infection and spread to and
between animals should that approach be required.
