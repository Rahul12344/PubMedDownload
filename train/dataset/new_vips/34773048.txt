The influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known for its ability to hinder
the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) during viral infection. Influenza
viruses lacking NS1 (ΔNS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated
human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral
and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is 
due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. 
This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ΔNS1 virus results in an
antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and
heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens,
including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that ΔNS1 influenza viruses could be
used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory
viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on ΔNS1 live
attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus
infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune 
induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.
