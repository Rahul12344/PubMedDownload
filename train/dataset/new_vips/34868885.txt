A novel coronavirus reportedly called 2019-nCoV started to spread around the
world at the end of 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) was later renamed after links with SARS were observed. Multiple
studies have reported possible connections between the COVID-19 virus and
neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Theories support that 
vitamin D deficiency plays a part in the pathogenicity of Parkinson's disease or 
the credibility of the associated dopamine system. Administration of vitamin D3
was shown to significantly enhance the motor and non-motor manifestations of
Parkinson's disease and enhance the quality of life. Also, multiple recent
reviews have shown specific ways in which vitamin D reduces the risk of
pathogenic infections. Recent studies supported the potential role of vitamin D
in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections and mortality. On the immunological
level, immune response regulation remains one of the well-recognized actions of
vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to complications in patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson's disease. Whereas more studies are required, 
Vitamin D supplementation with a moderate and well-calculated dosage of vitamin
D3 in patients with Parkinson's disease can help minimize the risk and burden of 
COVID-19 complications.
