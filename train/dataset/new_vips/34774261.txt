Estimating patterns of occurrence of cases and deaths related to the COVID-19
pandemic is a complex problem. The incidence of cases presents a great spatial
and temporal heterogeneity, and the mechanisms of accounting for occurrences
adopted by health departments induce a process of measurement error that alters
the dependence structure of the process. In this work we propose methods to
estimate the trend in the cases of COVID-19, controlling for the presence of
measurement error. This decomposition is presented in Bayesian time series and
spatio-temporal models for counting processes with latent components, and
compared to the empirical analysis based on moving averages. We applied time
series decompositions for the total number of deaths in Brazil and for the states
of São Paulo and Amazonas, and a spatio-temporal analysis for all occurrences of 
deaths at the state level in Brazil, using two alternative specifications with
global and regional components.
