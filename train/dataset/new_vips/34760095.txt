Background: Majority of the patients affected by Kaposi sarcoma (KS) have human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
lessened the incidence of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)- related KS. 
Cutaneous signs are the most common, but involving the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract is very important and dangerous because of serious complications including 
perforation and bleeding.
Case Presentation: This report is a rare case of gastric-KS presenting as melena 
in a non-AIDS 67-year-old woman. We describe the diagnosis and management of this
rare complication.
Conclusion: GI-KS is often asymptomatic with different endoscopic appearances,
and maybe present without cutaneous lesions. Thus, a high diagnostic suspicion is
needed and we should attend these GI complications.
