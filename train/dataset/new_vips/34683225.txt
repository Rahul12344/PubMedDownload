Due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) pandemic starting in early 2020, all social 
activities ceased in order to combat its high transmission rate. Since
vaccination combats one aspect for halting the spread of the virus, the biosensor
community has looked at another aspect of reducing the burden of the COVID-19
pandemic on society by developing biosensors that incorporate point-of-care (POC)
testing and the rapid identification of those affected in order to deploy
appropriate measures. In this study, we aim first to propose a screen-printed
carbon electrode (SPCE)-based electrochemical biosensor that meets the ASSURED
criteria (i.e., affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid,
equipment-free, and deliverable) for POC testing, but more importantly, we
describe the novelty of our biosensor's modifiability that uses custom dual
probes made from target nucleic acid sequences. Additionally, regarding the
sensitivity of the biosensor, the lowest sample concentration was 10 pM (p =
0.0257) without amplification, which might challenge the traditional technique of
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The purpose of this
study is to develop a means of diagnostics for the current pandemic as well as to
provide an established POC platform for future epidemics.
