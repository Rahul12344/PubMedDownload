OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of chest computed tomography in patients with
COVID-19 who presented initial negative result in reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study that evaluated 39 patients with
negative RT-PCR for COVID-19, who underwent chest computed tomography and had a
final clinical or serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The visual tomographic
classification was evaluated according to the Consensus of the Radiological
Society of North America and software developed with artificial intelligence for 
automatic detection of findings and chance estimation of COVID-19.
RESULTS: In the visual tomographic analysis, only one of them (3%) presented
computed tomography classified as negative, 69% were classified as typical and
28% as indeterminate. In the evaluation using the software, only four (about 10%)
had a probability of COVID-19 <25%.
CONCLUSION: Computed tomography can play an important role in management of
suspected cases of COVID-19 with initial negative results in RT-PCR, especially
considering those patients outside the ideal window for sample collection for
RT-PCR.
