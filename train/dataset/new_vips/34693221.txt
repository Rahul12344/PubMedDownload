RANTES is implicated in allergic asthma and in T cell-dependent clearance of
infection. RANTES receptor family comprises CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, which are
G-protein-coupled receptors consisting of seven transmembrane helices.
Infections with respiratory viruses like Rhinovirus cause induction of RANTES
production by epithelial cells. Here, we studied the role of RANTES in the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cohorts of children with and without asthma
and validated and extended this study to the airways of adults with and without
asthma. We further translated these studies to a murine model of asthma induced
by house dust mite allergen in wild-type RANTES and CCR5-deficient mice. Here we 
show an unpredicted therapeutic role of RANTES in the resolution of
allergen-induced asthma by orchestrating the transition of effector GATA-3+CD4+
T cells into immune-regulatory-type T cells and inflammatory eosinophils into
resident eosinophils as well as increased IL-10 production in the lung.
