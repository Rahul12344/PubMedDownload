Recently, viral infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and Influenza, are the
subjects of major concerns worldwide. One strategy for addressing these concerns 
focuses on nasal vaccines, which have great potential for achieving successful
immunization via safe, easy, and affordable approaches. However, conventional
nasal vaccines have major limitations resulting from fast removal when pass
through nasal mucosa and mucociliary clearance hindering their effectiveness.
Herein a nanoparticulate vaccine (NanoVac) exhibiting photochemical
immunomodulation and constituting a new self-assembled immunization system of a
photoactivatable polymeric adjuvant with influenza virus hemagglutinin for
efficient nasal delivery and antigen-specific immunity against pathogenic
influenza viruses is described. NanoVac increases the residence period of
antigens and further enhances by spatiotemporal photochemical modulation in the
nasal cavity. As a consequence, photochemical immunomodulation of NanoVacs
successfully induces humoral and cellular immune responses followed by
stimulation of mature dendritic cells, plasma cells, memory B cells, and CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, resulting in secretion of antigen-specific immunoglobulins,
cytokines, and CD8+ T cells. Notably, challenge with influenza virus after nasal 
immunization with NanoVacs demonstrates robust prevention of viral infection.
Thus, this newly designed vaccine system can serve as a promising strategy for
developing vaccines that are active against current hazardous pathogen outbreaks 
and pandemics.
