Recently, two cases of complete remission of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and
follicular lymphoma (FL) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. However, the
precise molecular mechanism of this rare event is yet to be understood. Here, we 
hypothesize a potential anti-tumor immune response of SARS-CoV-2 and based on a
computational approach show that: (i) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD may bind to the
extracellular domains of CD15, CD27, CD45, and CD152 receptors of cHL or FL and
may directly inhibit cell proliferation. (ii) Alternately, upon internalization
after binding to these CD molecules, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein and
ORF3a may bind to gamma-tubulin complex component 3 (GCP3) at its tubulin gamma-1
chain (TUBG1) binding site. (iii) The M protein may also interact with TUBG1,
blocking its binding to GCP3. (iv) Both the M and ORF3a proteins may render the
GCP2-GCP3 lateral binding where the M protein possibly interacts with GCP2 at its
GCP3 binding site and the ORF3a protein to GCP3 at its GCP2 interacting residues.
(v) Interactions of the M and ORF3a proteins with these gamma-tubulin ring
complex components potentially block the initial process of microtubule
nucleation, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. (vi) The Spike-RBD may
also interact with and block PD-1 signaling similar to pembrolizumab and
nivolumab- like monoclonal antibodies and may induce B-cell apoptosis and
remission. (vii) Finally, the TRADD interacting "PVQLSY" motif of Epstein-Barr
virus LMP-1, that is responsible for NF-kB mediated oncogenesis, potentially
interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, NSP7, NSP10, and spike (S) proteins, and may
inhibit the LMP-1 mediated cell proliferation. Taken together, our results
suggest a possible therapeutic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in lymphoproliferative
disorders.
