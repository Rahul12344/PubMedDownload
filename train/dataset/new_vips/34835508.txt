The majority of adults in the world (around 83%) carry antibodies reactive with
HCMV and are thought to retain inactive or latent infections lifelong. The virus 
is transmitted via saliva, so infection events are likely to be common. Indeed,
it is hard to imagine a life without exposure to HCMV. From 45 seronegative
individuals (13 renal transplant recipients, 32 healthy adults), we present seven
cases who had detectable HCMV DNA in their blood and/or saliva, or a CMV-encoded 
homologue of IL-10 (vIL-10) in their plasma. One case displayed NK cells
characteristic of CMV infection before her HCMV DNA became undetectable. In other
cases, the infection may persist with seroconversion blocked by vIL-10. Future
research should seek mechanisms that can prevent an individual from
seroconverting despite a persistent HCMV infection, as HCMV vaccines may not work
well in such people.
