Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) transformed hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in
2014; however, their impact on transplant candidates' willingness to accept
(CWTA) organs from HCV+ donors remains uncertain. We retrospectively studied
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data from 2008 to 2019,
investigating CWTA different organs from HCV+ donors over time, using segmented
multivariable logistic regression, and how that influenced wait-time and
deceased-donor transplantation (DDTx) probability, using multivariable logistic
or linear regression. We found that DAA availability was associated with a marked
increase in CWTA in all organs from HCV+ donors except intestine. By December
2020, 40% of kidney, 33% of kidney-pancreas, 42% of pancreas, over 50% of liver, 
heart, lung, heart-lung, and 9% of intestine candidates waitlisted were CWTA an
organ from HCV+ donors. Compared with pre-DAA, yearly CWTA kidney from HCV+
donors increased post-DAA 1.78 1.811.83 -fold, kidney-pancreas 2 .52 2.78 3.07
-fold, pancreas 3.15 3.69 4.43 -fold, liver 1.53 1.541.56 -fold, heart 1 .92 2.02
.08 -fold, and lung 2.00 2.12 .20 -fold. CWTA kidney and liver from HCV+ donors
significantly increased DDTx probability post-DAA (1.98 2.042.1 -fold and 1.24
1.291.33 -fold, respectively) and shortened kidney candidates' wait-time78 90101 
days (Mean with 95% CI). CWTA organs from HCV+ donors rose significantly with DAA
availability, benefitting kidney and liver candidates with increased DDTx rates
and shortened kidney candidates' wait time. Further long-term outcomes
investigation and standardized organ from HCV+ donors' education could improve
both provider and patient acceptance and utilization.
