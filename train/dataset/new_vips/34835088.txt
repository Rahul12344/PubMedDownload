Scientific evidence concerning the subacute and long-term effects of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is on the rise. It has been established that infection by
serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a systemic
process that involves multiple organs. The complications and long-term
consequences of COVID-19 are diverse and patients need a multidisciplinary
treatment approach in the acute and post-acute stages of the disease. A
significant proportion of COVID-19 patients experience neurological
manifestations, some enduring for several months post-recovery. However, brain
and skeletal muscle changes resultant from SARS CoV-2 infection remain largely
unknown. Here, we provide a brief overview of the current knowledge, and
usefulness, of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed
tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to investigate brain and skeletal muscles changes in 
Post-COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms. Furthermore, a brief discussion 
of future 18F-FDG-PET/CT applications that might advance the current knowledge of
the pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 is also provided.
