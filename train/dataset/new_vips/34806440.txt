Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is an RNA virus currently causing
a pandemic. Due to errors during replication, mutations can occur and result in
cell adaptation by the virus or in the rise of new variants. This can change the 
attachment receptors' usage, result in different morphology of plaques, and can
affect as well antiviral development. Indeed, a molecule can be active on
laboratory strains but not necessarily on circulating strains or be effective
only against some viral variants. Experiments with clinical samples with limited 
cell adaptation should be performed to confirm the efficiency of drugs of
interest. In this protocol, we present a method to culture severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs, obtain a high viral
titer while limiting cell adaptation, and assess antiviral efficiency.
