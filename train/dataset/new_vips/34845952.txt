With the accelerated pace of modern life, people are facing more and more health 
pressure. The study of polysaccharides seemed a good choice as a potential
treasure trove. Polysaccharides, one of the four basic substances (proteins,
nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates) that constitute life activities, are
obviously an underrated macromolecular substance with great potential. Compared
with protein and nucleic acid, the research of polysaccharides is still in the
primary stage. The relationship between structure and function of polysaccharides
is not clear. In this review, we highlighted the main methods of extraction,
purification and structure identification of polysaccharides; summarized their
biological activities including immunoregulation, hypoglycemic, anti-tumor,
anti-virus, anti-coagulation, and so on. Particularly, the relationship between
their structures and activities was described. In addition, the applications of
polysaccharides in health food, medicine and cosmetics were also reviewed. This
review can help polysaccharide researchers quickly understand the whole process
of polysaccharides research, and also provide a reference for the comprehensive
utilization of polysaccharides. We need to standardize the research of
polysaccharides to make the experimental data more universal, and take it as
important references in the review process. Glycomic may appear as the next
"omic" after genomic and proteomic in the future. This review provides support
for the advancement of glycomics.
