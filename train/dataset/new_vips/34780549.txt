OBJECTIVE: To compare hospitalized reproductive age women with COVID-19 who were 
pregnant, puerperal, or neither one nor the other in terms of demographic and
clinical characteristics and disease progression using Brazilian epidemiological 
data.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the
Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was
performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years
hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from
February 17, 2020 to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups:
pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and 
then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were
made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression
(admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive
ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each
group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support,
and admission to the ICU.
RESULTS: As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were 
identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither
pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of
demographic data and comorbidities (p<0.0001). Pregnant and puerperal women were 
less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other
(72.1%, 69.7% and 88.8%, respectively). Pregnant women, however, had a higher
frequency of anosmia, and ageusia than the others. After PSM, puerperal women had
a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU,
invasive ventilatory support, and death, with OR (95% CI) 1.97 (1.55 - 2.50),
2.71 (1.78 - 4.13), and 2.51 (1.79 - 3.52), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Puerperal women were at a higher risk for serious outcomes (need for 
the ICU, need for invasive and noninvasive ventilatory support, and death) than
pregnant women.
