Inhaled nebulized interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β have been shown to be effective in
the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to construct a
virus-free rapid detection system for high-throughput screening of IFN-like
compounds that induce viral RNA degradation and suppress the replication of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We prepared a
SARS-CoV-2 subreplicon RNA expression vector which contained the SARS-CoV-2
5'-UTR, the partial sequence of ORF1a, luciferase, nucleocapsid, ORF10, and
3'-UTR under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The expression vector
was transfected into Calu-3 cells and treated with IFN-α and the IFNAR2 agonist
CDM-3008 (RO8191) for 3 days. SARS-CoV-2 subreplicon RNA degradation was
subsequently evaluated based on luciferase levels. IFN-α and CDM-3008 suppressed 
SARS-CoV-2 subreplicon RNA in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 193
IU/mL and 2.54 μM, respectively. HeLa cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2
subreplicon RNA were prepared and treated with the IFN-α and pan-JAK inhibitor
Pyridone 6 or siRNA-targeting ISG20. IFN-α activity was canceled with Pyridone 6.
The knockdown of ISG20 partially canceled IFN-α activity. Collectively, we
constructed a virus-free rapid detection system to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA
suppression. Our data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 subreplicon RNA was degraded by
IFN-α-induced ISG20 exonuclease activity.
