The symptoms and complications of intestinal parasitosis can occur with long-term
corticosteroid therapy. We highlight the case of a young man who developed
chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and
vomiting while on treatment for multisystemic sarcoidosis with corticosteroids.
His symptoms were initially thought to be related to the gastrointestinal
manifestations of sarcoidosis, but further evaluation revealed a combined case of
intestinal strongyloidiasis and giardiasis as well as previously undiagnosed
human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV -1) infection. This distinctive case of
dual intestinal parasitosis highlights the need for clinicians to maintain a high
level of awareness to screen for intestinal parasites, particularly Strongyloides
when prescribing corticosteroids in the long term given the potential risk of
hyperinfection in the setting of immunosuppression..
