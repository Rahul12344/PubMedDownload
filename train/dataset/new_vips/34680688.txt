Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and
yellow fever viruses, is fully adapted to thrive in urban areas. The temporal
activity of this mosquito, however, varies within urban areas which might imply
different transmission risk. In this work, we hypothesize that temporal
differences in mosquito activity patterns are determined by local environmental
conditions. Hence, we explore the existence of groups of temporal patterns in
weekly time series of Ae. aegypti ovitraps records (2017-2019) by means of time
series clustering. Next, with the aim of predicting risk in places with no
mosquito field data, we use machine learning classification tools to assess the
association of temporal patterns with environmental variables derived from
satellite imagery and predict temporal patterns over the city area to finally
test the relationship with dengue incidence. We found three groups of temporal
patterns that showed association with land cover diversity, variability in
vegetation and humidity and, heterogeneity measured by texture indices estimated 
over buffer areas surrounding ovitraps. Dengue incidence on a neighborhood basis 
showed a weak but positive association with the percentage of pixels belonging to
only one of the temporal patterns detected. The understanding of the spatial
distribution of temporal patterns and their environmental determinants might then
become highly relevant to guide the allocation of prevention and potential
interventions. Further investigation is still needed though to incorporate other 
determinants not considered here.
