Bluetongue virus serotypes 1 to 24 are transmitted primarily by infected
Culicoides midges, in which they also replicate. However, "atypical" BTV
serotypes (BTV-25, -26, -27 and -28) have recently been identified that do not
infect and replicate in adult Culicoides, or a Culicoides derived cell line (KC
cells). These atypical viruses are transmitted horizontally by direct contact
between infected and susceptible hosts (primarily small ruminants) causing only
mild clinical signs, although the exact transmission mechanisms involved have yet
to be determined. We used reverse genetics to generate a strain of BTV-1 (BTV-1
RGC7) which is less virulent, infecting IFNAR(-/-) mice without killing them.
Reassortant viruses were also engineered, using the BTV-1 RGC7 genetic backbone, 
containing individual genome segments derived from BTV-26. These reassortant
viruses were used to explore the genetic control of horizontal transmission (HT) 
in the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model. Previous studies showed that genome segments 1, 2 
and 3 restrict infection of Culicoides cells, along with a minor role for segment
7. The current study demonstrates that genome segments 2, 5 and 10 of BTV-26
(coding for proteins VP2, NS1 and NS3/NS3a/NS5, respectively) are individually
sufficient to promote HT.
