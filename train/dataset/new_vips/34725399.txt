Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the main pathogens associated with
lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children worldwide.
Exosomes secreted by antigen presenting cells (APCs) can elicit immune responses 
by carrying major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules complexed
with antigenic peptides and other co-stimulating factors. Therefore, we developed
novel immunomagnetic nanographene particles to sequentially isolate, surface
engineer, and release intact dendritic cell (DC) exosomes for use as a potential 
vaccine platform against RSV. The H-2Db-restricted, immunodominant peptides from 
RSV (M187-195 and NS161-75) were introduced to MHC-I on DC-derived exosomes to
express peptide/MHC-I (pMHC-I) complexes. A mouse model of RSV infection was used
to define the immunogenicity of surface engineered exosomes for activating
virus-specific immune responses. Ex vivo assays demonstrated that engineered
exosomes carrying RSV-specific peptides can elicit interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)
production by virus-specific CD8+ T cells isolated from RSV-infected C57BL/6
mice. In vivo assays demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of both
M187-195 and NS161-75 engineered exosomes to mice, with or without additional
adjuvant, appeared safe and well tolerated, however, did not prime
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Surface engineered exosomes are
immunogenic and promising for further development as a vaccine platform.
