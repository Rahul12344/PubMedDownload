BACKGROUND: Clinical observations have shown that there is a relationship between
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral
blood; however, knowledge about the time course of the changes in atypical
lymphocytes and the association with the clinical course of COVID-19 is limited.
OBJECTIVE: Our purposes were to investigate the dynamics of atypical lymphocytes 
in COVID-19 patients and to estimate their clinical significance for diagnosis
and monitoring disease course.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 98 inpatients in a general
ward at Kashiwa Municipal Hospital from May 1st, 2020, to October 31st, 2020. We 
extracted data on patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, blood test
results, radiographic findings, treatment after admission and clinical course. We
compared clinical findings between patients with and without atypical
lymphocytes, investigated the behavior of atypical lymphocytes throughout the
clinical course of COVID-19, and determined the relationships among the
development of pneumonia, the use of supplemental oxygen and the presence of
atypical lymphocytes.
RESULTS: Patients with atypical lymphocytes had a significantly higher prevalence
of pneumonia (80.4% vs. 42.6%, p < 0.0001) and the use of supplemental oxygen
(25.5% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.0042). The median time to the appearance of atypical
lymphocytes after disease onset was eight days, and atypical lymphocytes were
observed in 16/98 (16.3%) patients at the first visit. Atypical lymphocytes
appeared after the confirmation of lung infiltrates in 31/41 (75.6%) patients. Of
the 13 oxygen-treated patients with atypical lymphocytes, approximately
two-thirds had a stable or improved clinical course after the appearance of
atypical lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: Atypical lymphocytes frequently appeared in the peripheral blood of
COVID-19 patients one week after disease onset. Patients with atypical
lymphocytes were more likely to have pneumonia and to need supplemental oxygen;
however, two-thirds of them showed clinical improvement after the appearance of
atypical lymphocytes.
