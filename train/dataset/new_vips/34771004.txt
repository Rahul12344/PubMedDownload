Papain-like protease is an essential enzyme in the proteolytic processing
required for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, such an enzyme is an
important target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents which may reduce
the mortality associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. A set of 69
semi-synthesized molecules that exhibited the structural features of SARS-CoV-2
papain-like protease inhibitors (PLPI) were docked against the coronavirus
papain-like protease (PLpro) enzyme (PDB ID: (4OW0). Docking studies showed that 
derivatives 34 and 58 were better than the co-crystallized ligand while
derivatives 17, 28, 31, 40, 41, 43, 47, 54, and 65 exhibited good binding modes
and binding free energies. The pharmacokinetic profiling study was conducted
according to the four principles of the Lipinski rules and excluded derivative
31. Furthermore, ADMET and toxicity studies showed that derivatives 28, 34, and
47 have the potential to be drugs and have been demonstrated as safe when
assessed via seven toxicity models. Finally, comparing the molecular orbital
energies and the molecular electrostatic potential maps of 28, 34, and 47 against
the co-crystallized ligand in a DFT study indicated that 28 is the most promising
candidate to interact with the target receptor (PLpro).
