Cancer immunotherapy is a new therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment that
targets tumors by improving or restoring immune system function. Therapies
targeting immune checkpoint molecules have exerted potent anti-tumor effects and 
prolonged the overall survival rate of patients. However, only a small number of 
patients benefit from the treatment. Oncolytic viruses exert anti-tumor effects
by regulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting multiple steps of tumor
immune circulation. In this study, we engineered two oncolytic viruses that
express mouse anti-PD-1 antibody (VT1093M) or mouse IL-12 (VT1092M). We found
that both oncolytic viruses showed significant anti-tumor effects in a murine
CT26 colon adenocarcinoma model. Importantly, the intratumoral combined injection
with VT1092M and VT1093M inhibited growth of the primary tumor, prevented growth 
of the contralateral untreated tumor, produced a vaccine-like response, activated
antigen-specific T cell responses and prolonged the overall survival rate of
mice. These results indicate that combination therapy with the engineered
oncolytic virus may represent a potent immunotherapy strategy for cancer
patients, especially those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy.
