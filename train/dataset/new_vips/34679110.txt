AIM: The long-term stress, anxiety and job burnout experienced by healthcare
workers (HCWs) are important to consider as the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic stresses healthcare systems globally. The primary objective
was to examine the changes in the proportion of HCWs reporting stress, anxiety,
and job burnout over six months during the peak of the pandemic in Singapore. The
secondary objective was to examine the extent that objective job characteristics,
HCW-perceived job factors, and HCW personal resources were associated with
stress, anxiety, and job burnout.
METHOD: A sample of HCWs (doctors, nurses, allied health professionals,
administrative and operations staff; N = 2744) was recruited via invitation to
participate in an online survey from four tertiary hospitals. Data were gathered 
between March-August 2020, which included a 2-month lockdown period. HCWs
completed monthly web-based self-reported assessments of stress (Perceived Stress
Scale-4), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and job burnout (Physician
Work Life Scale).
RESULTS: The majority of the sample consisted of female HCWs (81%) and nurses
(60%). Using random-intercept logistic regression models, elevated perceived
stress, anxiety and job burnout were reported by 33%, 13%, and 24% of the overall
sample at baseline respectively. The proportion of HCWs reporting stress and job 
burnout increased by approximately 1·0% and 1·2% respectively per month. Anxiety 
did not significantly increase. Working long hours was associated with higher
odds, while teamwork and feeling appreciated at work were associated with lower
odds, of stress, anxiety, and job burnout.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived stress and job burnout showed a mild increase over six
months, even after exiting the lockdown. Teamwork and feeling appreciated at work
were protective and are targets for developing organizational interventions to
mitigate expected poor outcomes among frontline HCWs.
