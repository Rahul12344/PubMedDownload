BACKGROUND: The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) was the first to be
introduced in Bangladesh to fight the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. As this
vaccine had shown some side-effects in its clinical trial, we aimed to conduct a 
study assessing short-term adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) in
Bangladesh.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on social and electronic media
platforms by delivering an online questionnaire among people who had taken at
least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The collected data were then analysed to 
evaluate various parameters related to the AEFIs of the respondents.
RESULTS: A total of 626 responses were collected. Of these, 623 were selected
based on complete answers and used for the analysis. Most of the respondents were
between 30-60 years of age, and 40.4% were female. We found that a total of 8.5% 
of the total respondents had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our survey 
revealed that out of 623 volunteers, 317 reported various side-effects after
taking the vaccine, which is about 50.88% of the total participants. The majority
of participants (37.07%, 231/623) reported swelling and pain at the injection
site and fever (25.84%, 162/623); these were some of the common localized and
generalized symptoms after the COVID-19 vaccine administration.
CONCLUSION: The side-effects reported after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine (Covishield) are similar to those reported in clinical trials,
demonstrating that the vaccines have a safe therapeutic window. Moreover, further
research is needed to determine the efficacy of existing vaccines in preventing
SARS-CoV-2 infections or after-infection hospitalization.
