Duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1) infection is the main cause of duck viral 
hepatitis, but the replication process and distribution of DHAV-1 in vivo are
still poorly understood. In this study, six-day-old ducklings were infected by
two different methods: by intramuscular injection to establish DHAV-1 infection
animal models and by the combined administration of virus solution orally,
through nasal inhalation, through inoculation of the eye, and through intrarectal
contact to simulate natural infection. Tissues were collected at different time
points and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed
to analyze the gene expression levels of DHAV-1 in different tissues. The results
showed that the viral gene levels responded to the different challenge methods.
Viral gene expression levels in all tissues in the intramuscular injection group 
were lower than those in the group that simulated natural infection. In both
groups, the liver was the primary tissue that responsible for the replication of 
DHAV-1 genes, as virus gene level peaked at 4 h post infection (hpi). In
addition, the respiratory and digestive tracts were important regions for DHAV-1 
infection as high viral gene levels were detected at early (8 hpi) and late (96
hpi) stages of infection. This research utilized a novel infection method to
simulate natural infection and analyzed the DHAV-1 distribution in different
tissues. The findings can provide guidance for making prevention and control
measures.
