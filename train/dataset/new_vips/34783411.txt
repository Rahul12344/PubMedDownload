ISSUES: This systematic review aimed to provide an updated estimate on the
prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among non-injecting
people who use drugs (PWUD) and the various subgroups and the odds of HIV
infection in the injecting compared to non-injecting PWUD.
APPROACH: A comprehensive search of international, regional and national
databases was performed from January 2005 to May 2020. We conducted backward
citation tracking of the included studies and contacted experts for unpublished
studies. Studies providing HIV prevalence among non-injecting PWUD were included.
Data were also drawn from a previous systematic review, covering 10 years from
1998 to 2007, and was added to the new database. The HIV prevalence was pooled
for non-injecting PWUD and other subgroups using the random-effects model.
KEY FINDINGS: Seventeen studies with a total sample of 9912 non-injecting PWUD
were found. The prevalence of HIV infection was 1.9% (95% confidence interval
0.9, 3.1) for 2007 and afterward (nine studies). It was not significantly
different from the estimate for the years before 2007 (0.5%; 95% confidence
interval 0.0, 2.0; eight studies). No significant difference was found among
gender subgroups. The overall estimate of odds of HIV infection among injecting
PWUD was 5.7 (95% confidence interval 3.2, 10.0) times higher than non-injecting 
PWUD.
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The HIV prevalence among the non-injecting PWUD was
higher than the general population in Iran. Targeting non-injection PWUD by
preventive measures such as harm reduction, drug and psychoeducation, and
surveillance seem to be crucial in reducing HIV prevalence in this group.
