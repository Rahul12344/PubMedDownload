In rural India, since 2014, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) has
ensured construction of more than 100 million toilets and is now focusing on
reinforcement of sanitation behaviors. We report a cholera outbreak in a remote
village in western India where open defecation was implicated in causation. A
water pipeline was damaged in the vicinity of a stream flowing from a site of
open defecation. Despite the availability of a toilet facility in the majority of
households (75%), open defecation was widely practiced (62.8%). Many reported not
washing hands with soap and water before eating (78.5%) and after defecation
(61.1%). The study emphasizes the need for focused health behavior studies and
evidence-based interventions to reduce the occurrence of cholera outbreaks. This 
could be the last lap in the path toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal
6, which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and
sanitation for all."
