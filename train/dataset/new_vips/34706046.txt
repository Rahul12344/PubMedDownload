OBJECTIVES: to understand the meanings and significance attributed by people with
HIV/aids to the process of living with this virus/disease.
METHODS: qualitative and exploratory study, carried out in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. The Grounded Theory and the Symbolic Interactionism were used. Data were 
collected in a semistructured interview and through non-participant observation, 
from August 2017 to May 2018. 29 patients participated.
RESULTS: living with HIV/AIDS is a social phenomenon in which it is not possible 
to disconnect the process of adapting to the disease from the social relations
one (re)constructs during life. It also involves stigmatization, rejection, and
isolation.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: understanding the meanings of this process is a positive
influence for proactive behavior and resilience, not only in regard to the care
concerning the presence of the virus and the uninterrupted need to adhere to
medication, but also in the way to deal with the social values that reproduce
previous models, which, in turn, can help improve self-knowledge.
