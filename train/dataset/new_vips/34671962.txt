OBJECTIVES: A new type of coronavirus outbreak has emerged in China and caused a 
pandemic. World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official name of this
disease 'COVID-19'. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate pain in
COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: Patients who were followed in the ward of an infectious diseases
department because of possible or confirmed COVID-19 between May and September of
2020 were included in the study. The Turkish version of the Brief Pain Inventory 
(BPI) was applied. Demographic features, frequency, location, the intensity of
pain, and response to analgesics were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 178 participants were included in the study. Ninety-one
(51.1%) of patients had pain complaints and the mean pain score (MPS) was
2.28±2.81 over 10. Fifty-nine (56.0%) of participants with pain required
analgesic therapy and 41 (80.3%) of them showed ≥50% pain relief with simple
analgesics. Twelve of the remaining 18 who did not get enough pain relief with
simple analgesic were taking their analgesics pro re nata (PRN) rather than
around the clock (ATC). Pain frequency and intensity and mean hospitalization
duration (MHD) were similar between confirmed and possible cases.
CONCLUSION: Regarding the results, we conclude that pain is not one of the
challenging symptoms and easily manageable in patients with a mild-moderate
intensity of COVID-19. Our results were not enough to make a correlation between 
pain and the clinical course of the disease. Further studies are required for the
evaluation of pain including patients in intensive care units.
