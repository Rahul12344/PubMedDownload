SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and has
since spread throughout the world, infecting over 200 million people. The fast
spread of SARS-CoV-2 showcased the need for rapid and sensitive testing
methodologies to help track the disease. Over the past 18 months, numerous
SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Many of these variants are suggested to be more
transmissible as well as less responsive to neutralization by vaccine-induced
antibodies. Viral whole-genome sequencing is the current standard for tracking
these variants. However, whole-genome sequencing is costly and the technology and
expertise are limited to larger reference laboratories. Here, we present the
feasibility of a fast, inexpensive methodology using snapback primer-based
high-resolution melting to test for >20 high-consequence SARS-CoV-2 spike
mutations. This assay can distinguish between multiple variant lineages and be
completed in roughly 2 h for less than $10 per sample.
