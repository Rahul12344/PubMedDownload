The breadth of animal hosts that are susceptible to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and may serve as reservoirs for continued
viral transmission are not known entirely. In August 2020, an outbreak of
SARS-CoV-2 occurred on five mink farms in Utah and was associated with high mink 
mortality (35-55% of adult mink) and rapid viral transmission between animals.
The premise and clinical disease information, pathology, molecular
characterization, and tissue distribution of virus within infected mink during
the early phase of the outbreak are provided. Infection spread rapidly between
independently housed animals and farms, and caused severe respiratory disease and
death. Disease indicators were most notably sudden death, anorexia, and increased
respiratory effort. Gross pathology examination revealed severe pulmonary
congestion and edema. Microscopically there was pulmonary edema with moderate
vasculitis, perivasculitis, and fibrinous interstitial pneumonia. Reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of tissues collected at necropsy
demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in multiple organs including
nasal turbinates, lung, tracheobronchial lymph node, epithelial surfaces, and
others. Localization of viral RNA by in situ hybridization revealed a more
localized infection, particularly of the upper respiratory tract. Whole genome
sequencing from multiple mink was consistent with published SARS-CoV-2 genomes
with few polymorphisms. The Utah mink SARS-CoV-2 strains fell into Clade GH,
which is unique among mink and other animal strains sequenced to date. While
sharing the N501T mutation which is common in mink, the Utah strains did not
share other spike RBD mutations Y453F and F486L found in nearly all mink from the
United States. Mink in the outbreak reported herein had high levels of SARS-CoV-2
in the upper respiratory tract associated with symptomatic respiratory disease
and death.
