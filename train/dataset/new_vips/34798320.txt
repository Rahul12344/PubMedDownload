A small non-coding, evolutionarily conserved regulatory RNA molecule known as
microRNA (miRNA) regulates various cellular activities and pathways. MicroRNAs
remain evolutionarily conserved in different species of same taxa. They are
present in all organisms including viruses. Viral miRNAs are small, less
conserved and less stable and have higher negative minimal folding free energy
than miRNAs of different organisms. The size of viral precursor miRNA is
approximately 60-119 nucleotides in length. The structure of the mature miRNA
sequences is predicted by using higher negative MFE (ΔG) value. Rous sarcoma
Virus (RSV), named after its inventor Peyton Rous, has been known for causing
tumors in the chicken for which it is known as an oncogenic retrovirus. Using
specific criteria we have predicted 5 potential miRNAs in RSV which targeted 8
tumor suppressor genes in Gallus gallus. This study aims to predict the potential
miRNAs, secondary structures and their targets for better understanding of the
regulatory network of Rous sarcoma virus miRNA in forming sarcoma.
