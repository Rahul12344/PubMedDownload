The Dengue pathophysiology has had several aspects determined over the years.
However, some points remain elusive, such as the metabolic factors that regulate 
the massive B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells observed in
Dengue patients. In this chapter, we describe an in vitro method capable of
mimicking this Dengue-induced cell expansion. More specifically, this approach
allows dengue virus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
healthy individuals to enhance the frequency of phenotypical and functional
antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) after 7 days of culture. A manuscript recently
published by Bonezi and colleagues displays results generated through this
methodology.
