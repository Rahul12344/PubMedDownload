The combination of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection and other respiratory pathogens is a real challenge for health care
systems in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and management. Most of the reported
bacterial coinfections among SARS-CoV-2 patients are hospital-acquired infections
that occurred after several days of hospitalization. Little is known about the
incidence of community-acquired atypical bacterial coinfections with SARS-CoV-2. 
In this work, we report on a rare case of an elderly SARS-CoV-2 patient with
underdiagnosed bacterial coinfections who received care in the medical ward for
23 days then was discharged home. Retrospective serological investigation
revealed positivity for Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
indicating double community-acquired atypical bacterial coinfections that were in
agreement with clinical manifestations that patients showed at his admission to
the hospital. Screening for possible community-acquired respiratory co-pathogens 
among elderly SARS-CoV-2 patients is critical for effective treatment and
management.
