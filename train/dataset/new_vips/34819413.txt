Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), the new member of the genus Uukuvirus, was isolated
from the tick Haemaphysalis flava in 2018 in Japan. To date, there is no
information on KAMV infection in human and animals. Therefore, serological
surveillance of the infection among humans and wild mammals was conducted by
virus-neutralization (VN) test and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Sera 
of 24 humans, 59 monkeys, 171 wild boars, 233 Sika deer, 7 bears, and 27 nutria
in Yamaguchi Prefecture were analyzed by VN test. The positive ratio of humans,
monkeys, wild boars, and Sika deer were 20.8%, 3.4%, 33.9% and 4.7%,
respectively. No positive samples were detected in bears and nutria. The
correlation coefficients between VN test and IFA in human, monkey, wild boar, and
Sika deer sera were 0.5745, 0.7198, 0.9967 and 0.9525, respectively. In addition,
KAMV was detected in one pool of Haemaphysalis formosensis ticks in Wakayama
Prefecture. These results indicated that KAMV or KAMV-like virus is circulating
among many wildlife and ticks, and that this virus incidentally infects humans.
