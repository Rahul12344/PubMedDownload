BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic influenced education and forced universities to
shift from face-to-face teaching to remote online teaching. This sudden shift in 
educational pedagogy provoked several challenges to educators.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the first experience of nursing 
faculty members with online distant education (ODE) within the context of
COVID-19 national curfew.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design guided by a phenomenological approach
was used utilizing purposive sampling for exploring the experiences of fifteen
nursing faculty members by two focus group discussions through Zoom.
RESULTS: Qualitative analysis, using Colaizzi's method revealed four major themes
including: (1) resolving immediate reaction toward abrupt compulsory online
teaching; fulfilling teaching responsibilities; managing the challenges of ODE,
(2) struggling with available resources and capabilities; (3) ODE defeated
geographic and time boundaries, and interrupted personal time management: yet a
new learning experience; insufficiency of ODE; and (4) achieving clinical
competencies and learning outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the importance of preparing and
training faculty to embrace and sustain the mastery of ODE to ensure the success 
of ODE. It also emphasizes the institutional and infrastructure readiness to
enhance the transition from traditional teaching and learning to ODE.
