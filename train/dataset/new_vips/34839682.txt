Historically, nurses have volunteered to serve in wars and natural catastrophes. 
However, instead of a distant disaster, many nurses in the UK volunteered,
working above and beyond, to assist their colleagues, local communities and
health systems in the NHS during the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the
motivations and benefits to the community or self of volunteerism have been
discussed in the literature, there is a paucity of literature and theoretical
understanding from the field of nursing. Using a reflective and personal account 
of volunteering, this article aims to provide a better understanding of the
concept of volunteerism in nursing. By exploring associated nursing theories from
Jean Watson and Kristen Swanson, this article aims to illuminate and expand the
knowledge base about nursing volunteerism. These nursing theories can frame the
act of volunteerism and nursing and illustrate the interrelations of nursing
theory and the practice of nursing volunteerism.
