Giant condyloma acuminatum, caused by herpes simplex virus infection, is a large 
cauliflower shaped lesion that has a propensity to infiltrate surrounding tissues
with paradoxically benign microscopic/histological appearance. This lesion is
often benign, though it does have the potential for malignant transformation.
Here we present a case that demonstrates this potential and describes the
pathological and histological findings in detail. The report concludes with the
clinical reasoning for considering surgical resection in these patients.
