Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
novel strain that causes acute respiratory illnesses known as coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is limited information regarding the
therapeutic management for this disease. Several studies have stated that
antivirals drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir may
potentially inhibit the virus from spreading to the host.
Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the clinical
effectiveness and safety of remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir on
COVID-19.
Methods: The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2021 
to identify eligible experimental randomized controlled trials on remdesivir,
favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 patients. This systematic
review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline.
Results: From 158 references, 15 studies were included in the review. The results
showed that remdesivir has some potential benefits for hospitalized COVID-19
patients, as seen from clinical improvements such as faster recovery time, less
duration of hospitalization, and fewer respiratory side effects among COVID-19
patients. However, the impact of remdesivir in reducing mortality remains
uncertain. Treatment with favipiravir has shown promising improvement in the
clinical status of COVID-19 patients, although the results suggested no
significant differences in some clinical parameters such as length of
hospitalizations and clinical recovery. A combination of favipiravir with other
supportive therapy showed more favorable outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Furthermore, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients reported no
significant clinical improvement compared to standard care with notable adverse
effect reactions.
Conclusion: This study provides an overview of the evidence-based role of
remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in the management of COVID-19. A
thorough assessment of the benefit-risk profile in COVID-19 patients is urgently 
needed. The current review was based on very limited available data; therefore,
further well-designed clinical trials are required.
