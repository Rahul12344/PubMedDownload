The devastating impact of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on
public health, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has made targeting the COVID-19 pandemic a top priority in medical
research and pharmaceutical development. Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is 
essential for the comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity and their impact 
on virulence and pathogenicity. The SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 10 (ORF10)
protein interacts with multiple human proteins CUL2, ELOB, ELOC, MAP7D1, PPT1,
RBX1, THTPA, TIMM8B, and ZYG11B expressed in lung tissue. Mutations and
co-occurring mutations in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants are expected to 
impact the severity of the virus and its associated consequences. In this
article, we highlight 128 single mutations and 35 co-occurring mutations in the
unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants. The possible predicted effects of these
mutations and co-occurring mutations on the secondary structure of ORF10 variants
and host protein interactomes are presented. The findings highlight the possible 
effects of mutations and co-occurring mutations on the emerging 140 ORF10 unique 
variants from secondary structure and intrinsic protein disorder perspectives.
