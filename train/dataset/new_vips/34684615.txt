Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an excess in community mortality across
the globe. We review recent evidence on the clinical pathology of COVID-19,
comorbidity factors, immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and factors
influencing infection outcomes. The latter specifically includes diet and
lifestyle factors during pandemic restrictions. We also cover the possibility of 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission through food products and the food chain, as well as
virus persistence on different surfaces and in different environmental
conditions, which were major public concerns during the initial days of the
pandemic, but have since waned in public attention. We discuss useful measures to
avoid the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread through food, and approaches that may reduce 
the risk of contamination with the highly contagious virus. While hygienic
protocols are required in food supply sectors, cleaning, disinfection, avoidance 
of cross-contamination across food categories, and foodstuffs at different stages
of the manufacturing process are still particularly relevant because the virus
persists at length on inert materials such as food packaging. Moreover, personal 
hygiene (frequent washing and disinfection), wearing gloves, and proper use of
masks, clothes, and footwear dedicated to maintaining hygiene, provide on-site
protections for food sector employees as well as supply chain intermediates and
consumers. Finally, we emphasize the importance of following a healthy diet and
maintaining a lifestyle that promotes physical well-being and supports healthy
immune system function, especially when government movement restrictions
("lockdowns") are implemented.
