In the last two decades, several coronavirus (CoV) interspecies jumping events
have occurred between bats and other animals/humans, leading to major
epidemics/pandemics and high fatalities. The SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 had a
~10% fatality. The discovery of SARS-related CoVs in horseshoe bats and civets
and genomic studies have confirmed bat-to-civet-to-human transmission. The MERS
epidemic that emerged in 2012 had a ~35% mortality, with dromedaries as the
reservoir. Although CoVs with the same genome organization (e.g., Tylonycteris
BatCoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus BatCoV HKU5) were also detected in bats, there is
still a phylogenetic gap between these bat CoVs and MERS-CoV. In 2016, 10 years
after the discovery of Rhinolophus BatCoV HKU2 in Chinese horseshoe bats, fatal
swine disease outbreaks caused by this virus were reported in southern China. In 
late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread
globally, leading to >4,000,000 fatalities so far. Although the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV, patient zero and the original
source of the pandemic are still unknown. To protect humans from future public
health threats, measures should be taken to monitor and reduce the chance of
interspecies jumping events, either occurring naturally or through recombineering
experiments.
