The frequencies of 19 respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 were assessed
in 6,"?>235 Brazilian individuals tested for COVID-19. Overall, only 83
individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had codetection of other
pathogens. Individuals infected with Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Human Coronavirus
(HCoV)-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HPIV-4, Influenza A (-H1N1 and other subtypes), Influenza
B, Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Human Metapneumovirus were less likely
to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infection with Streptococcys pyogenes,
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis were
more frequent in individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, but without
significancy. We found 150 individuals infected with ≥2 pathogens other than
SARS-CoV-2, only 3 out of whom tested positive for COVID-19. The codetection
frequency was low in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Other viral infections 
may provide a cross-reactive, protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2.
Screening for bacterial respiratory infections upon COVID-19 testing is important
to drive suitable therapeutic approaches and avoid unnecessary antibiotic
prescription.
