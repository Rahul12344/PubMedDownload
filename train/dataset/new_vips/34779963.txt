Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease
associated with the gene RUNX2. Disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) have emerged as a useful resource to further study human hereditary
diseases such as CCD. In this study, we identified a novel CCD-specific RUNX2
mutation and established iPSCs with this mutation. Biopsies were obtained from
familial CCD patients and mutation analyses were performed through Sanger
sequencing and next generation sequencing. CCD-specific human iPSCs (CCD-hiPSCs) 
were established and maintained under completely defined serum, feeder, and
integration-free condition using a non-integrating replication-defective Sendai
virus vector. We identified the novel mutation RUNX2_c.371C>G and successfully
established CCD-hiPSCs. The CCD-hiPSCs inherited the same mutation, possessed
pluripotency, and showed the ability to differentiate the three germ layers. We
concluded that RUNX2_c.371C>G was likely pathogenic because our results, derived 
from next generation sequencing, are supported by actual clinical evidence,
familial tracing, and genetic data. Thus, we concluded that hiPSCs with a novel
CCD-specific RUNX2 mutation are viable as a resource for future studies on CCD.
