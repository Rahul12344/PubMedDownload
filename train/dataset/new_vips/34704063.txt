Utilizing 11 waves of data from the Household Pulse Survey collected between
April and November 2020, this study examines disparities in psychological
distress (defined as having symptoms of anxiety/depression) among adult residents
of Hawai'i during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that 36.4% of the
respondents reported symptoms of distress. Younger age, female, and lower
household income were associated with higher levels of psychological distress
than older age, male, and higher household income. The prevalence ratios of
distress for those aged 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 and females were 43.1%, 47.3%, 44.1%,
and 39.3% respectively. Asians experienced lower prevalence compared to other
racial/ethnic groups. Two practical implications are offered. First, the economic
sequelae of COVID-19 impact psychological distress even when the community
infection rate is stable. Second, disparities in psychosocial distress
demonstrate that social and economic resources are needed by social groups such
as young adults, females, and racial/ethnic minorities that have experienced the 
highest impact. Strategies need to be developed to mitigate the unavoidable local
consequences of a pandemic.
