This study investigated the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS-CoV-2) in individuals who re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after
recovering from their primary illness. We investigated 295 individuals with
re-positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results and 836 of
their close contacts. We attempted virus isolation in individuals with
re-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results using cell culture and confirmed the
presence of neutralizing antibodies using serological tests. Viral culture was
negative in all 108 individuals with re-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results in
whom viral culture was performed. Three new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were
identified among household contacts using PCR. Two of the three new cases had had
contact with the index patient during their primary illness, and all three had
antibody evidence of past infection. Thus, there was no laboratory evidence of
viral shedding and no epidemiological evidence of transmission among individuals 
with re-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results.
