BACKGROUND: Studies of risk factors are especially valuable at this difficult
time in the midst of a pandemic. High levels of particulate matter (PM) represent
a serious risk factor on health. While this is a direct impact on health,
indirect effects are worth considering too.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PM in
the transmission of viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. Also, we sought to understand
dynamics of PM in still air at high and low altitudes. Historic AQI and physical 
PM measurements were collected between August and September 2020 using air
quality detector. Potential correlations between the number of total confirmed
COVID-19 cases and average air quality index (AQI) from varied geographic
locations were also assessed.
RESULTS: Airborne PM levels were weakly associated with COVID-19 cases after
analysing 77 territories. PM remained longer in the air at high altitudes
compared to measurements made at sea level. This suggests that the link between
PM and COVID-19 transmission could be aggravated in areas of high altitude.
CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights that particulate matter can be involved in
SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, confounding factors may have impacted the
association between the two variables. These findings can serve as a foundation
for future studies on the effect of air pollutants and fine particulate matter on
viral transmission.
