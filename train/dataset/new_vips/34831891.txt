The aim of the study was to assess the level of knowledge about COVID-19 disease 
and preventive behaviour of undergraduate students of nursing, midwifery, and
emergency medicine.MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic survey was conducted among
students of nursing, midwifery, and emergency medicine during the COVID-19
pandemic, from 8 April 2021 to 6 June 2021 in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.
RESULTS: A total of 37 men and 238 women participated in the study. A moderate
level of knowledge was found in 88% and high in 11% of students Midwifery
students had a higher level than nursing students (p = 0.002) and students of
emergency medicine (p = 0.003). The female gender is much more afraid of
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (p = 0.021). The most common preventive measure was to
avoid people who coughed or had a cold (93%). Only 84% of students were
vaccinated. Students who had a high level of knowledge more often avoided people 
who coughed or had a cold (p = 0.03) and gave up on meeting with friends (p =
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Constant education of students on the principles of dealing with the
risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is necessary. It is important to continually
motivate students to adhere to the principles of prevention. In the face of the
existing epidemiological threat, there is a need to change the curricula for the 
fields of health sciences by adding the subject infectious diseases-clinic and
nursing, with special attention to practical aspects.
