The SARS-CoV-2 Lambda (Pango lineage designation C.37) variant of interest,
initially identified in Peru, has spread to additional countries. First detected 
in Israel in April 2021 following importations from Argentina and several
European countries, the Lambda variant infected 18 individuals belonging to two
main transmission chains without further spread. Micro-neutralisation assays
following Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNTech-Pfizer) vaccination demonstrated a
significant 1.6-fold reduction in neutralising titres compared with the wild type
virus, suggesting increased susceptibility of vaccinated individuals to
infection.
