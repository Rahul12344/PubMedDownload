We report pilot studies to evaluate the susceptibility of common domestic
livestock (cattle, sheep, goat, alpaca, rabbit, and horse) to intranasal
infection with SARS-CoV-2. None of the infected animals shed infectious virus via
nasal, oral, or faecal routes, although viral RNA was detected in several
animals. Further, neutralizing antibody titres were low or non-existent one month
following infection. These results suggest that domestic livestock are unlikely
to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.
