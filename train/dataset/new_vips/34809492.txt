Background: New variants are evolving in severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations have been
associated with a higher capacity to evade neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). We
aimed at determining the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and infection on human milk
antibody titers and activity against the RBD mutations from SARS-CoV-2 variants
of concern. Materials and Methods: Milk samples were collected from 19 COVID-19
vaccinated women, 10 women who had a positive COVID-19 PCR test, and 13
unvaccinated women. The titers and NAbs of secretory IgA (SIgA)/IgA, secretory
IgM (IgM)/IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 RBD with mutations N501Y or E484K were 
measured by using ELISA and a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Results: The 
titers of human milk IgG against N501Y were higher in the COVID-19 vaccine group 
than in the no-vaccine group but comparable with the COVID-19 PCR group. Other
antibody titers did not differ between the three groups. The titers of SIgA/IgA
were higher than those of SIgM/IgM and IgG in all three groups. The titers of
SIgM/IgM and the inhibition of NAbs were higher against the mutation E484K than
N501Y. Milk NAb did not differ between the three groups, but the inhibition of
NAb against binding of the two mutant RBD proteins to their receptor was higher
in the COVID-19 vaccine and PCR groups than in milk from prepandemic women.
Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination and exposure of mothers to SARS-CoV-2
influenced the titers and NAbs in breast milk against the variants of concern.
