Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most frequent cancer in
humans, and is now responsible for as many deaths as melanoma. Immunotherapy has 
changed the therapeutic landscape of advanced CSCC after the FDA approval of
anti-PD1 molecules for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic CSCC.
However, roughly 50% of patients will not respond to this systemic treatment and 
even those who do respond can develop resistance over time. The etiologies of
primary and secondary resistance to immunotherapy involve changes in the
neoplastic cells and the tumor microenvironment. Indirect modulation of immune
system activation with new therapies, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and
new immunotherapeutic agents, and direct modulation of tumor immunogenicity using
other systemic treatments or radiotherapy are now under evaluation in combined
regimens. The identification of predictors of response is an important area of
research. In this review, we focus on the features associated with the response
to immunotherapy, and the evaluation of combination treatments and new molecules,
a more thorough knowledge of which is likely to improve the survival of patients 
with advanced CSCC.
