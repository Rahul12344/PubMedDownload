After India's first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in late January 2020,
misinformation surrounding the outbreak and "cures" for the virus spread across
the nation through various platforms. Across the globe, social media applications
like WhatsApp and Facebook have played a vital role in the advancement of
misinformation; however, in India, the dissemination of inaccurate information
has been particularly exacerbated by public figures advancing their conservative 
ideologies and bringing the "sacred" cow to centre stage. Several influential
religious and political leaders were witnessed vehemently supporting their
long-held narratives that cow excreta is a "proven" precautionary remedy against 
most diseases, including coronavirus. Hence, to debunk such claims, the authors, 
in this essay, first analyse media used to circulate unfounded information
concerning coronavirus across the world, followed by citing India-specific events
where customary beliefs of Hindus have now taken the form of practices which can 
worsen the spread, as such practices lack significant scientific backing.
Finally, we discuss the impact of such misinformation on human rights, and how
states and social media companies can combat the infodemic. Keywords:
Coronavirus, cow products, human rights, social-media, misinformation.
