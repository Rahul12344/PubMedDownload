INTRODUCTION: Increasing access to multi-month dispensing (MMD) of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) supports treatment continuity and viral load suppression for people
living with HIV (PLHIV) and reduces burden on health facilities. During the
COVID-19 response, PEPFAR worked with ministries of health to scale up MMD and
expand eligibility to new groups of PLHIV, including children and
pregnant/breastfeeding women. We analysed PEPFAR program data to understand the
impact of the policy changes on actual practice.
METHODS: We conducted a desk review in 21 PEPFAR-supported countries to identify 
and collect official documentation released between March and June 2020
addressing changes to MMD guidance during the COVID-19 response. MMD coverage,
the proportion of all ART clients on MMD, was assessed in the calendar quarters
preceding the COVID-19 response (Q4 2019, October-December 2019; and Q1,
January-March 2020) and the quarters following the start of the response (Q2
2020, April-June 2020; Q3 2020, July-September, 2020; Q4 2020, October-December
2020). We used the two-proportion Z-test to test for differences in MMD coverage 
pre-COVID-19 (Q4 2019) and during implementation of COVID-19 policy adaptations
(Q2 2020).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As of June 2020, 16 of the 21 PEPFAR-supported countries 
analysed adapted MMD policy or promoted intensified scale-up of MMD in response
to COVID-19. MMD coverage for all clients on ART grew from 49% in Q4 2019
pre-COVID-19 to 72% in Q2 2020 during COVID-19; among paediatric clients (< 15), 
MMD coverage increased from 27% to 51% in the same period. Adaptations to MMD
policy were associated with a significantly accelerated growth in the proportion 
of clients on MMD (p < 0.001) for all populations, irrespective of age and
dispensing interval.
CONCLUSIONS: Access to MMD markedly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic,
supporting treatment continuity while mitigating exposure to COVID-19 at health
facilities. This model is beneficial in public health emergencies and during
disruptions to the healthcare system. Outside emergency contexts, expanded MMD
eligibility extends client-centred care to previously excluded populations. The
success in expanding MMD access during COVID-19 should motivate countries to
recommend broader MMD access as a new standard of care.
