Dengue is a viral infection caused by the arboviridae family of viruses and is
transmitted by the vector, a mosquito with the scientific name Aedes egyptii. The
fever caused by the Dengue virus is best labelled as Break Bone fever because of 
the severe myalgia that accompanies the infection. Snakebite is also a global
health problem. Mostly seen in tropical countries and countries with agriculture 
as the backbone of the economy, it has a varied presentation in such extremes
that it can go from a very mild course of disease not requiring antidote
administration to life-threatening complications of respiratory muscles
paralysis, coagulopathy, and rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury based 
on the nature of the venom of the snake. Here, we report a case of snakebite who 
was also battling a concurrent Dengue infection thus complicating the management 
of the patient.
