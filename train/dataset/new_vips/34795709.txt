Background: The human immunodeficiency virus infection remains a devastating
disease of public health importance.
Objectives: To assess the association between oral health and quality of life and
the factors affecting the oral health related quality of life among HIV positive 
patients in Nigeria.
Methods: This was a cross sectional study of HIV positive patients attending two 
HIV outpatient clinics in Nigeria. Impact of oral health on quality of life was
assessed using the OHIP-14. Oral health status was assessed by the DMFT and
Simplified OHI indices. Level of significance was set at p< 0.05.
Results: Three hundred and fifty-two patients were seen, 64.2% being females.
Prevalence of impact was 8.5%; and the mean OHIP scores was 8.05±9.54. Highest
impact was "painful aching" 67(19.1%) with the domain of physical pain scoring
the highest mean impact of 2.32. Most patients (88.6%) were on HAART. Following
logistic regression, after controlling for potential confounders, independent
factors associated with poor OHRQoL were perceived need for dental treatment,
HAART use, and higher DMFT (p<0.05).
Conclusion: The domain of physical pain had the highest impact, while perceived
need for dental treatment, HAART use and higher caries index were contributory to
poor OHRQoL.
