OBJECTIVE: Curative treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are
available, but access and barriers to treatment can delay initiation. We
investigated the time to first negative RNA test result among people with HCV
infection and examined differences by homeless status and whether people were
tested at a correctional facility or substance use treatment facility.
METHODS: We used surveillance data to identify New York City residents first
reported with HCV infection during January 1, 2015-December 31, 2018, with â‰¥1
positive RNA test result during January 1, 2015-November 1, 2019. We used
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine the time from the first positive RNA 
test result to the first negative RNA test result, with right-censoring at date
of death or November 1, 2019. We determined substance use treatment,
incarceration, or homelessness by ordering facility name and address or from
patient residential address.
RESULTS: Of 13 952 people with an HCV RNA-positive test result first reported
during 2015-2018, 6947 (49.8%) subsequently received an RNA-negative test result.
Overall, 25% received an RNA-negative test result within 208 (95% CI, 200-216)
days and 50% within 902 (95% CI, 841-966) days. Homelessness, incarceration, or
substance use treatment was indicated for 4304 (30.9%) people, among whom 25%
received an RNA-negative test result within 469 (95% CI, 427-520) days and <50%
received an RNA-negative test result during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to connect people to treatment should occur soon after
diagnosis, especially for people who could benefit from hepatitis C care
coordination.
