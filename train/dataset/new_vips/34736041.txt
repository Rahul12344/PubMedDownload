Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are known to mediate predisposition to Parkinson
disease. Fibroblasts heterozygous for the G2019S LRRK2 mutation were obtained
from a 53-year-old male patient with disease onset at 34 years (LCSBi005,
ND29542), and from a 63-year-old male patient with disease onset at 56 years
(LCSBi006, ND34267). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones were generated
for each cell line using Sendai virus. The absence of chromosomal defects was
confirmed using array comparative genomic hybridization. The cell lines express
pluripotency markers and have the ability to differentiate into all three germ
layers.
