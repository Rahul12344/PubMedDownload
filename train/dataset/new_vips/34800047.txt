We wish to respond to the comments received from Drs. Wu, Tseng and Kao. Our
analysis was focused on comparing HBV RNA and hepatitis B core related antigen
(HBcrAg) levels with existing markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication (HBV
DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen) and whether the two novel markers could
improve distinguishing the different phases of infection.
