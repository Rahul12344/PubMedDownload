OBJECTIVE: Routine follow-up of pregnancy is a comprehensive care process
starting from planning of pregnancy that involves rational and careful use of
medical, psychological, and social support. In this study, our objective was to
compare the adherence rate to routine antenatal follow-up program during the
COVID-19 pandemic with that of previous years among pregnant women, in an effort 
to shed light on health policies to be developed similar events in the future.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out between March
11, 2019, when isolation measures were initiated in the context of precautionary 
steps taken in Turkey against the COVID-19 pandemic, and June 1, 2020, when the
"normalization" was initiated.
RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, the proportion of cesarean sections
were higher, 61.1%, as compared to previous years (p=0.27). The stillbirths were 
numerically lower (1.2%, p=0.77), but the rate of spontaneous abortions was
significantly higher (19.6%, p=0.009). The number of follow-up visits per
pregnancy was lower than in previous years (3.8, p=0.02), although the proportion
of patients visiting the outpatient units for regular controls to the overall
patient group increased as compared to previous years (52.0%).
CONCLUSION: During the flare-up of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. between March and 
June 2020), the rate of obstetric/neonatal morbidity and mortality except
spontaneous abortion was not significantly higher as compared to the
corresponding period in previous years. However, considering the potential
increase in the risk of obstetric complications during a pandemic, specialized
management programs targeting basic pregnancy follow-up services should be
developed.
