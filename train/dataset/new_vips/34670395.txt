INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious health and socioeconomic
impacts on people all over the world. It was expected that Africa would be the
hardest hit; consequently, Nigeria and other African nations worked with
non-government organisations to institute a framework for controlling the spread 
of the disease and the resultant economic woes. The measures, however, largely
focused on urban centres, whereas the spread of the virus and the disease
transcended imported urban cases to spread through the rural community. This
study explored the experiences of traditional rulers, who are closest to rural
people, in the fight against COVID-19.
METHODS: A qualitative research design was adopted and data were collected from
eight Nigerian traditional rulers through interviews. The collected data were
coded inductively using NVivo v12 and were then analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Findings showed that the traditional rulers adopted measures such as the
use of town criers to raise awareness among rural people about COVID-19. Findings
also revealed that the protection measures led to increased economic hardship for
rural people in Nigeria. Doubt about the existence of the virus and widespread
poverty were found to be the major hindrances in the fight against the pandemic.
CONCLUSION: It is recommended that traditional rulers collaborate with the
government to make free protective equipment available for poor rural people, and
collaborate with youths and religious leaders to properly fight the 'infodemic'
through continuous community education and awareness-raising.
