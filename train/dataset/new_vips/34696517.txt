Influenza viruses represent a continuous threat to both animal and human health. 
The 2009 H1N1 A influenza pandemic highlighted the importance of a swine host in 
the adaptation of influenza viruses to humans. Nowadays, one of the most extended
strategies used to control swine influenza viruses (SIVs) is the trivalent
vaccine application, whose formulation contains the most frequently circulating
SIV subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These vaccines do not provide full protection 
against the virus, allowing its replication, evolution, and adaptation. To better
understand the main mechanisms that shape viral evolution, here, the SIV
intra-host diversity was analyzed in samples collected from both vaccinated and
nonvaccinated animals challenged with the H1N1 influenza A virus. Twenty-eight
whole SIV genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing, and differences in
nucleotide variants between groups were established. Substitutions were allocated
along all influenza genetic segments, while the most relevant nonsynonymous
substitutions were allocated in the NS1 protein on samples collected from
vaccinated animals, suggesting that SIV is continuously evolving despite vaccine 
application. Moreover, new viral variants were found in both vaccinated and
nonvaccinated pigs, showing relevant substitutions in the HA, NA, and NP
proteins, which may increase viral fitness under field conditions.
