Emiliania huxleyi is a cosmopolitan coccolithophore widespread in temperate
oceans. This unicellular photoautotroph forms massive recurring blooms that play 
an important role in large biogeochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur, which play
a role in climate change. The mechanism of bloom formation and demise, controlled
by giant viruses that routinely infect these blooms, is poorly understood. We
generated a pan-transcriptome of E. huxleyi, derived from three strains with
different susceptibility to viral infection. Expression profiling of E. huxleyi
sensitive and resistant strains showed major basal differences, including many
genes that are induced upon viral infection. This suggests that basal gene
expression can affect the host metabolic state and the susceptibility of E.
huxleyi to viruses. Due to its ecological importance, the pan-transcriptome and
its protein translation, applicable to many E. huxleyi strains, is a powerful
resource for investigation of eukaryotic microbial communities.
