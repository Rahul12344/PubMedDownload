As the world is racing to develop perpetual immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
emergence of new viral strains, together with vaccination and reinfections, are
all contributing to a long-term immunity against the deadly virus that has taken 
over the world since its introduction to humans in late December 2019. The
discovery that more than 95 percent of people who recovered from COVID-19 had
long-lasting immunity and that asymptomatic people have a different immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic people has shifted attention to how our
immune system initiates such diverse responses. These findings have provided
reason to believe that SARS-CoV-2 days are numbered. Hundreds of research papers 
have been published on the causes of long-lasting immune responses and variations
in the numbers of different immune cell types in COVID 19 survivors, but the main
reason of these differences has still not been adequately identified. In this
article, we focus on the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which
initiates molecular processes that allow our immune system to generate antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2. To establish lasting immunity to SARS-CoV-2, we suggest that 
AID could be the key to unlocking it.
