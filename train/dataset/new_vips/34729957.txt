Australia was one of the first countries with unrestricted access to government
subsidized direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for adults with chronic
hepatitis C virus. This study assessed real-world DAA treatment outcomes across a
diverse range of Australian clinical services and evaluated factors associated
with successful treatment and loss to follow-up. Real-world Effectiveness of
Antiviral therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C (REACH-C) consisted a national
observational cohort of 96 clinical services including specialist clinics and
less traditional settings such as general practice. Data were obtained on
consecutive individuals who commenced DAAs from March 2016 to June 2019.
Effectiveness was assessed by sustained virological response ≥12 weeks following 
treatment (SVR) using intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses.
Within REACH-C, 10,843 individuals initiated DAAs (male 69%; ≥50 years 52%;
cirrhosis 22%). SVR data were available in 85% (9,174 of 10,843). SVR was 81%
(8,750 of 10,843) by ITT and 95% (8,750 of 9,174) by PP. High SVR (≥92%) was
observed across all service types and participant characteristics. Male gender
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.72),
cirrhosis (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41-0.64), recent injecting drug use (IDU; aOR 0.64,
95% CI 0.46-0.91) and previous DAA treatment (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.90)
decreased the likelihood of achieving SVR. Multiple factors modified the
likelihood of loss to follow-up including IDU ± opioid agonist therapy (OAT; IDU 
only: aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.44-2.11; IDU + OAT: aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.11-1.74; OAT
only, aOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.13-1.68) and age (aOR 0.97, 95% CI 0.97-0.98).
Conclusion: Treatment response was high in a diverse population and through a
broad range of services following universal access to DAA therapy. Loss to
follow-up presents a real-world challenge. Younger people who inject drugs were
more likely to disengage from care, requiring innovative strategies to retain
them in follow-up.
