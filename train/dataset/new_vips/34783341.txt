Autophagy, the pathways that degrade cytoplasmic constituents in lysosomes,
contribute to most biological processes from aging and neurodegeneration to
pathogen restriction and immunity. In recent years, it was realized that the
autophagy machinery serves additional functions, primarily in endo- and
exocytosis. In this review, I summarize recent advances in our understanding on
how these non-canonical functions differ from canonical macroautophagy, and
contribute to immune activation and viral replication. Understanding these
pathways will allow us to harness them for the treatment of human diseases, as
well as appreciate how cells use modules of membrane remodeling and trafficking
for multiple biological functions.
