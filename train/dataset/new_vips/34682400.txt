The "Earthrise" photograph, taken on the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, became one of the
most significant images of the 20th Century. It triggered a profound shift in
environmental awareness and the potential for human unity-inspiring the first
Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we
initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary
Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a
shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of
society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of
the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected
global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have 
been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating
opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the
necessity of a "Great Transition". While ambitious integrative efforts have never
been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value
systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our 
contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for
creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with
advancing global urbanization in the digital age-for personal, environmental,
economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally
consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting 
the inspiration of "Earthrise", we welcome diverse perspectives from across all
dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new
normative values. Building on academic rigor, we seek to place greater value on
imagination, kindness and mutualism as we address our greatest challenges, for
the health of people, places and planet.
