BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has and will
continue to affect many pregnant women. Knowledge regarding the risk of vertical 
transmission is limited. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
of nasopharyngeal swabs typically have been used to confirm the diagnosis among
infants, but whether the virus can be detected in other biological specimens, and
therefore potentially transmitted in other ways, is unknown. Positive SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR has been reported from feces and urine from adult patients. We hypothesize
that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in infant urine and fecal samples after prenatal 
COVID-19 exposure is low.
METHODS: We examined the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR in urine and
fecal samples among 42 infants born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers during
different stages of pregnancy.
RESULTS: A urine sample was collected from 39 of 42 infants and fecal samples
from all 42 infants shortly after birth. Although the majority of the women had
the symptomatic disease (85.6%), we were unable to detect the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 virus from any infant urine or fecal samples.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in infant urine or feces after maternal 
infection during pregnancy, providing further evidence for low rates of perinatal
transmission.
IMPACT: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the urine or feces of infants of mothers
with COVID-19 during various time points in pregnancy. This study provides
further evidence for low rates of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results
help to provide guidance on perinatal care practices for infants exposed to
COVID-19 in utero.
