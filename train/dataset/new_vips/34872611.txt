BACKGROUND: Data in the literature about HSV reactivation in COVID-19 patients
are scarce, and the association between HSV-1 reactivation and mortality remains 
to be determined. Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of Herpes simplex
virus (HSV) reactivation in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections primarily 
on mortality, and secondarily on hospital-acquired
pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) and intensive care
unit-bloodstream infection (ICU-BSI).
METHODS: We conducted an observational study using prospectively collected data
and HSV-1 blood and respiratory samples from all critically ill COVID-19 patients
in a large reference center who underwent HSV tests. Using multivariable Cox and 
cause-specific (cs) models, we investigated the association between HSV
reactivation and mortality or healthcare-associated infections.
RESULTS: Of the 153 COVID-19 patients admitted for ≥ 48 h from Feb-2020 to
Feb-2021, 40/153 (26.1%) patients had confirmed HSV-1 reactivation (19/61 (31.1%)
with HSV-positive respiratory samples, and 36/146 (24.7%) with HSV-positive blood
samples. Day-60 mortality was higher in patients with HSV-1 reactivation (57.5%) 
versus without (33.6%, p = 0.001). After adjustment for mortality risk factors,
HSV-1 reactivation was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard risk
[HR] 2.05; 95% CI 1.16-3.62; p = 0.01). HAP/VAP occurred in 67/153 (43.8%) and
ICU-BSI in 42/153 (27.5%) patients. In patients with HSV-1 reactivation,
multivariable cause-specific models showed an increased risk of HAP/VAP (csHR
2.38, 95% CI 1.06-5.39, p = 0.037), but not of ICU-BSI.
CONCLUSIONS: HSV-1 reactivation in critically ill COVID-19 patients was
associated with an increased risk of day-60 mortality and HAP/VAP.
