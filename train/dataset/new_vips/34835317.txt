Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system
(CNS) for which both genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified.
The strongest synergy among them exists between the MHC class II haplotype and
infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV), especially symptomatic primary EBV
infection (infectious mononucleosis) and elevated EBV-specific antibodies. In
this review, we will summarize the epidemiological evidence that EBV infection is
a prerequisite for MS development, describe altered EBV specific immune responses
in MS patients, and speculate about possible pathogenic mechanisms for the
synergy between EBV infection and the MS-associated MHC class II haplotype. We
will also discuss how at least one of these mechanisms might explain the recent
success of B cell-depleting therapies for MS. While a better mechanistic
understanding of the role of EBV infection and its immune control during MS
pathogenesis is required and calls for the development of innovative experimental
systems to test the proposed mechanisms, therapies targeting EBV-infected B cells
are already starting to be explored in MS patients.
