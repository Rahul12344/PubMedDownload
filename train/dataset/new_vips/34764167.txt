BACKGROUND: Individual behaviour changes, such as hand hygiene and physical
distancing, are required on a population scale to reduce transmission of
infectious diseases such as COVID-19. However, little is known about effective
methods of communicating risk reducing information, and how populations might
respond.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesise evidence relating to what (1) characterises effective
public health messages for managing risk and preventing infectious disease and
(2) influences people's responses to messages.
DESIGN: A rapid systematic review was conducted. Protocol is published on
Prospero CRD42020188704.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched: Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO and
Healthevidence.org, and grey literature (PsyarXiv, OSF Preprints) up to May 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: All study designs that (1) evaluated public health messaging
interventions targeted at adults and (2) concerned a communicable disease spread 
via primary route of transmission of respiratory and/or touch were included.
Outcomes included preventative behaviours, perceptions/awareness and intentions. 
Non-English language papers were excluded.
SYNTHESIS: Due to high heterogeneity studies were synthesised narratively
focusing on determinants of intentions in the absence of measured
adherence/preventative behaviours. Themes were developed independently by two
researchers and discussed within team to reach consensus. Recommendations were
translated from narrative synthesis to provide evidence-based methods in
providing effective messaging.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible papers were identified. Characteristics of
effective messaging include delivery by credible sources, community engagement,
increasing awareness/knowledge, mapping to stage of epidemic/pandemic. To
influence intent effectively, public health messages need to be acceptable,
increase understanding/perceptions of health threat and perceived susceptibility.
DISCUSSION: There are four key recommendations: (1) engage communities in
development of messaging, (2) address uncertainty immediately and with
transparency, (3) focus on unifying messages from sources and (4) frame messages 
aimed at increasing understanding, social responsibility and personal control.
Embedding principles of behavioural science into public health messaging is an
important step towards more effective health-risk communication during
epidemics/pandemics.
