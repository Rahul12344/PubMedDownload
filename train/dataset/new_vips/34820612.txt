The use of convalescent plasma (CP) from individuals recovered from severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising therapeutic
modality for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CP has been in use for at
least a century to provide passive immunity against a number of diseases, and was
recently proposed by the World Health Organization for human Ebola virus
infection. Only a few small studies have so far been published on patients with
COVID-19 and concomitant hematological malignancies (HM). The Italian Hematology 
Alliance on HM and COVID-19 has found that HM patients with COVID-19 clinically
perform more poorly than those with either HM or COVID-19 alone. A COVID-19
infection in patients with B-cell lymphoma is associated with impaired generation
of neutralizing antibody titers and lowered clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Treatment
with CP was seen to increase antibody titers in all patients and to improve
clinical response in 80% of patients examined. However, a recent study has
reported impaired production of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in an
immunosuppressed individual treated with CP, possibly supporting the notion of
virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral
replication occurs. This may limit the efficacy of CP treatment in at least some 
HM patients. More recently, it has been shown that CP may provide a neutralising 
effect against B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants, thus expanding its
application in clinical practice. More extensive studies are needed to further
assess the use of CP in COVID-19-infected HM patients.
