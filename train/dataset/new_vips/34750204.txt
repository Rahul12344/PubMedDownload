IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) recognizes viral DNAs from both
nucleus-replicating viruses and cytoplasm-replicating viruses. Isoform 2 of IFI16
(IFI16-iso2) with nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been studied
extensively as a well-known DNA sensor. However, the characteristics and
functions of other IFI16 isoforms are almost unknown. Here, we find that
IFI16-iso1, with exactly the same length as IFI16-iso2, lacks the NLS and locates
in the cytoplasm. To distinguish the functions of IFI16-iso1 and IFI16-iso2, we
have developed novel nuclear viral DNA mimics that can be recognized by the
nuclear DNA sensors, including IFI16-iso2 and hnRNPA2B1. The hexanucleotide motif
5'-AGTGTT-3' DNA form of the nuclear localization sequence (DNLS) effectively
drives cytoplasmic viral DNA nuclear translocation. These nuclear viral DNA
mimics potently induce IFN-β and antiviral IFN-stimulated genes in human A549
cells, HEK293T cells, and mouse macrophages. The subcellular location difference 
of IFI16 isoforms determines their differential functions in recognizing viral
DNA and activating type I IFN-dependent antiviral immunity. IFI16-iso1
preferentially colocalizes with cytoplasmic HSV60mer and cytoplasm-replicating
vaccinia virus (VACV), whereas IFI16-iso2 mainly colocalizes with nuclear
HSV60-DNLS and nucleus-replicating HSV-1. Compared with IFI16-iso2, IFI16-iso1
induces more transcription of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes, as well as stronger
antiviral immunity upon HSV60mer transfection or VACV infection. IFI16-iso2, with
the ability of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, clears both invaded HSV type 1 and 
VACV significantly. However, IFI16-iso2 induces more type I IFN-dependent
antiviral immunity than IFI16-iso1 upon HSV60-DNLS transfection or HSV type 1
infection. Our study has developed potent agonists for nuclear DNA sensors and
also has demonstrated that IFI16 isoforms with cytoplasmic and nuclear locations 
play differential roles in innate immunity against DNA viruses.
