OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of dexamethasone in 
dialysis patients with COVID-19 and whether it predicts mortality.
METHODS: This is a comparative cross-sectional study of 113 consecutive patients 
with COVID-19 with severe pneumonia signs. The patients were divided into two
groups according to the use of dexamethasone treatment: group 1 (n=45) included
patients who were treated with dexamethasone and group 2 (n=68) who did not
receive dexamethasone.
RESULTS: The mean age of both groups was 67.0±10.6 and 67.2±13.0 years,
respectively (p=0.947). With respect to demographic and laboratory findings,
there were no significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). The
hospitalization time of patients in group 1 was longer than that in group 2 (11
[7-17] days vs. 8 [5.3-14] days, p=0.093]. The 28-day survival rate was 54.2% in 
the group receiving dexamethasone treatment and 79.5% in the group not receiving 
dexamethasone treatment (p=0.440).
CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone did not reduce mortality rates and the requirement for 
intensive care unit in dialysis patients with COVID-19. Larger prospective
randomized clinical trials are required to associate personalized medicine with
the corticosteroid treatment to select suitable patients who are more likely to
show a benefit.
