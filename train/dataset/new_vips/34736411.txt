BACKGROUND: Psychosis in pregnancy is rare and could be life-threatening. It
requires prompt evaluation and proper management accordingly.
Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAr) encephalitis following herpes
simplex virus (HSV) infection is a rare cause of psychosis during pregnancy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old woman at 18 weeks gestation presented with
agitation and a 3-day history of hallucinations. She had a prior hospitalization 
for HSV encephalitis 6 weeks before. Her laboratory workup was unremarkable
except for positive anti-NMDAr antibodies in the CSF. The patient was treated
with high-dose corticosteroids and plasmapheresis, and she was discharged 2 weeks
later fully recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-NMDAr encephalitis can be the culprit behind a new-onset of
psychosis in pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.
