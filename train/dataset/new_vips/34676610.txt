Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPRs)-CRISPR-associated protein systems are bacterial and archaeal defense
mechanisms against invading elements such as phages and viruses. To overcome
these defense systems, phages and viruses have developed inhibitors called
anti-CRISPRs (Acrs) that are capable of inhibiting the host CRISPR-Cas system via
different mechanisms. Although the inhibitory mechanisms of AcrIIC1, AcrIIC2, and
AcrIIC3 have been revealed, the inhibitory mechanisms of AcrIIC4 and AcrIIC5 have
not been fully understood and structural data are unavailable. In this study, we 
elucidated the crystal structure of Type IIC anti-CRISPR protein, AcrIIC4. Our
structural analysis revealed that AcrIIC4 exhibited a helical bundle fold
comprising four helixes. Further biochemical and biophysical analyses showed that
AcrIIC4 formed a monomer in solution, and monomeric AcrIIC4 directly interacted
with Cas9 and Cas9/sgRNA complex. Discovery of the structure of AcrIIC4 and their
interaction mode on Cas9 will help us elucidate the diversity in the inhibitory
mechanisms of the Acr protein family.
