Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a derivative of the antimalaria drug chloroquine
primarily prescribed for autoimmune diseases. Recent attempts to repurpose HCQ in
the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 has raised concerns because of its
propensity to prolong the QT-segment on the electrocardiogram, an effect
associated with increased pro-arrhythmic risk. Since chirality can affect drug
pharmacological properties, we have evaluated the functional effects of the R(-) 
and S(+) enantiomers of HCQ on six ion channels contributing to the cardiac
action potential and on electrophysiological parameters of isolated Purkinje
fibers. We found that R(-)HCQ and S(+)HCQ block human Kir2.1 and hERG potassium
channels in the 1 μM-100 μM range with a 2-4 fold enantiomeric separation. NaV1.5
sodium currents and CaV1.2 calcium currents, as well as KV4.3 and KV7.1 potassium
currents remained unaffected at up to 90 μM. In rabbit Purkinje fibers, R(-)HCQ
prominently depolarized the membrane resting potential, inducing autogenic
activity at 10 μM and 30 μM, while S(+)HCQ primarily increased the action
potential duration, inducing occasional early afterdepolarization at these
concentrations. These data suggest that both enantiomers of HCQ can alter cardiac
tissue electrophysiology at concentrations above their plasmatic levels at
therapeutic doses, and that chirality does not substantially influence their
arrhythmogenic potential in vitro.
