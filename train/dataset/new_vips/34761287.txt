Close observation of the local transmission of influenza A(H1N1) viruses enabled 
an estimate of the length of time the virus was transmitted without a mutation.
Of 4,448 isolates from 11 consecutive years, 237 isolates could be categorized
into 57 strain groups with identical hemagglutinin genes, which were monitored
for the entire duration of an epidemic season. In addition, 35 isolates with
identical sequences were identified at the study site and in other countries
within 147 days. Consequently, it can be postulated that once an influenza virus 
enters a temperate region, the strain rarely mutates before the end of the
season.
