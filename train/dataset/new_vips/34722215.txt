Background: Diarrhea in newborn small ruminants continues to be the cause of
significant financial loss in sheep and goat farms worldwide. Commercial
immunochromatographic (IC) assays have been designed and evaluated to be used for
the diagnosis of diarrhea in cattle; however, there are no trials to use rapid
tests in small ruminants.
Aim: This study was carried out in Kuwait to evaluate the performance of the
rapid immunochromatography test (BoviD-4, BioNote, Inc, Korea) for diagnostics of
Cryptosporidium, rotavirus A (RVA), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and Escherichia
coli K99 (E. coli K99) in fecal samples of sheep and goats.
Methods: A total of 85 samples were examined using BoviD-4, and the results were 
compared with that of polymerase chain reaction for Cryptosporidium, RVA, and
BCoV, whereas for E. coli K99 it was by isolation and identification as reference
tests.
Results: The kappa test agreement results between the BoviD-4 and reference tests
were 0.870 (perfect), 0.783 (substantial), 0.728 (substantial), and 0.281 (fair) 
for the detection of E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium, RVA, and BCoV, respectively.
The sensitivity of BoviD-4 kit was 91.2%, 80.0%, 90.0%, and 37.5% and the
specificity was 88.2%, 96.0%, 96.4%, and 92.2% for Cryptosporidium, RVA, E. coli 
K99, and BCoV, respectively.
Conclusion: The Bovid-4 kit can be used as a rapid pen-side test for
Cryptosporidium spp., E. coli K99, and RVA in the field. Nonetheless, care must
be taken while interpreting the BCoV results of the kit.
