This work describes an untargeted analytical approach for the screening,
identification, and characterization of the trans-epithelial transport of green
tea (Camellia sinensis) catechin extracts with in vitro inhibitory effect against
the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) activity. After specific catechin
extraction, a chromatographic separation obtained six fractions were carried out.
The fractions were assessed in vitro against the PLpro target. Fraction 5 showed 
the highest inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (IC50 of 0.125 μg
mL-1). The untargeted characterization revealed that (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate
(ECG) was the most abundant compound in the fraction and the primary molecule
absorbed by differentiated Caco-2 cells. Results indicated that fraction 5 was
approximately 10 times more active than ECG (IC50 value equal to 11.62 ± 0.47 μg 
mL-1) to inhibit the PLpro target. Overall, our findings highlight the
synergistic effects of the various components of the crude extract compared to
isolated ECG.
