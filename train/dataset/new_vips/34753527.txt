OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a daily attestation system used by
employees of a multi-institutional academic medical center, which comprised of
symptom-screening, self-referrals to the Occupational Health Services team,
and/or a severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test.
DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all employee attestations
and SARS-CoV-2 tests performed between March and June 2020.
SETTING: A large multi-institutional academic medical center, including both
inpatient and ambulatory settings.
PARTICIPANTS: All employees who worked at the study site.
METHODS: Data were combined from the attestation system (COVIDPass), the employee
database, and the electronic health records and were analyzed using descriptive
statistics including Ï‡2, Wilcoxon, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. We investigated
whether an association existed between symptomatic attestations by the employees 
and the employee testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: After data linkage and cleaning, there were 2,117,298 attestations
submitted by 65,422 employees between March and June 2020. Most attestations were
asymptomatic (99.9%). The most commonly reported symptoms were sore throat (n =
910), runny nose (n = 637), and cough (n = 570). Among the 2,026 employees who
ever attested that they were symptomatic, 905 employees were tested within 14
days of a symptomatic attestation, and 114 (13%) of these tests were positive.
The most common symptoms associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were anosmia 
(23% vs 4%) and fever (46% vs 19%).
CONCLUSIONS: Daily symptom attestations among healthcare workers identified a
handful of employees with COVID-19. Although the number of positive tests was
low, attestations may help keep unwell employees off campus to prevent
transmissions.
