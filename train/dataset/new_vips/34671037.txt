Effective treatments against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed. Monoclonal antibodies have shown promising
results in patients. Here, we evaluate the in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic
effect of COVA1-18, a neutralizing antibody highly potent against the B.1.1.7
isolate. In both prophylactic and therapeutic settings, SARS-CoV-2 remains
undetectable in the lungs of treated hACE2 mice. Therapeutic treatment also
causes a reduction in viral loads in the lungs of Syrian hamsters. When
administered at 10 mg kg-1 one day prior to a high dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in
cynomolgus macaques, COVA1-18 shows very strong antiviral activity in the upper
respiratory compartments. Using a mathematical model, we estimate that COVA1-18
reduces viral infectivity by more than 95% in these compartments, preventing
lymphopenia and extensive lung lesions. Our findings demonstrate that COVA1-18
has a strong antiviral activity in three preclinical models and could be a
valuable candidate for further clinical evaluation.
