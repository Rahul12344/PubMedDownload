COVID-19 infection survivors suffer from a constellation of symptoms referred to 
as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, in the wake of recent evidence
highlighting the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in tissues and
emerging information regarding the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and
various components of the host cell macroautophagy/autophagy machinery, the
unforeseen long-term consequences of this infection, such as increased risk of
malignancies, should be explored. Although SARS-CoV-2 is not considered an
oncogenic virus, the possibility of increased risk of cancer among COVID-19
survivors cannot be ruled out. Herein, we provide an overview of the possible
mechanisms leading to cancer development, particularly obesity-related cancers
(e.g., colorectal cancer), resulting from defects in autophagy and the blockade
of the autophagic flux, and also immune escape in COVID-19 survivors. We also
highlight the potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection in the
prognosis of patients with cancer and their response to different cancer
treatments. Finally, we consider future directions for further investigations on 
this matter.
