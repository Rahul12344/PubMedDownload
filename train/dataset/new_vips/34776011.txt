BACKGROUND: To date, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes increasingly
fierce due to the emergence of variants. Rapid herd immunity through vaccination 
is needed to block the mutation and prevent the emergence of variants that can
completely escape the immune surveillance. We aimed to systematically evaluate
the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in the real world and to
establish a reliable evidence-based basis for the actual protective effect of the
COVID-19 vaccines, especially in the ensuing waves of infections dominated by
variants.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from inception to July 22,
2021. Observational studies that examined the effectiveness and safety of
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among people vaccinated were included. Random-effects or
fixed-effects models were used to estimate the pooled vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
and incidence rate of adverse events after vaccination, and their 95% confidence 
intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 58 studies (32 studies for vaccine effectiveness and 26
studies for vaccine safety) were included. A single dose of vaccines was 41% (95%
CI: 28-54%) effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, 52% (31-73%) for
symptomatic COVID-19, 66% (50-81%) for hospitalization, 45% (42-49%) for
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, and 53% (15-91%) for COVID-19-related
death; and two doses were 85% (81-89%) effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2
infections, 97% (97-98%) for symptomatic COVID-19, 93% (89-96%) for
hospitalization, 96% (93-98%) for ICU admissions, and 95% (92-98%) effective for 
COVID-19-related death, respectively. The pooled VE was 85% (80-91%) for the
prevention of Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 75% (71-79%) for the Beta
variant, 54% (35-74%) for the Gamma variant, and 74% (62-85%) for the Delta
variant. The overall pooled incidence rate was 1.5% (1.4-1.6%) for adverse
events, 0.4 (0.2-0.5) per 10 000 for severe adverse events, and 0.1 (0.1-0.2) per
10 000 for death after vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have reassuring safety and could effectively
reduce the death, severe cases, symptomatic cases, and infections resulting from 
SARS-CoV-2 across the world. In the context of global pandemic and the continuous
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, accelerating vaccination and improving
vaccination coverage is still the most important and urgent matter, and it is
also the final means to end the pandemic.
