Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped,
positive-sense RNA coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Since
December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 127
million people, 2.7 million deaths globally (as per WHO dashboard, dated 31
March, 2020), the virus is capable of transmitting from human to human via
inhalation of infected respiratory droplets or aerosols or contact with infected 
fomites. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with severe respiratory
distress syndrome, which is very similar to the presentation of other respiratory
viral infections. A huge variation in the host response exists, with the
resulting symptoms varying from mild to moderate. Comorbidities such as
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, coagulation dysfunction, stroke, 
malignant tumor and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, as well as age and sex, 
are associated with severe COVID-19 cases. So far, no targeted therapies have
been developed to treat this disease and existing drugs are being investigated
for repurposing. This chapter discusses the epidemiology, clinical features of
COVID-19, pathogenesis and the innate and adaptive immune response mounted by the
host to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A deeper understanding of the host-pathogen
interaction is fundamental to the development of a vaccine.
