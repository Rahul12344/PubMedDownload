Hantavirus can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and 
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in America, with high mortality and unknown
mechanisms. Innate immunity is the host's first-line defense to bridge the
acquired immunity against viral infections. However, hantavirus has evolved
various strategies in both molecular and cellular aspects to evade the host's
natural immune surveillance. The Interferon-I (IFN-I) signaling pathway, a
central link of host defense, induces various antiviral proteins to control the
infection. This paper summarizes the molecular mechanisms of hantavirus evasion
mechanisms of the IFN signaling pathway and cellular processes such as regulated 
cell death and cell stress. Besides, hantavirus could also evade immune
surveillance evasion through cellular mechanisms, such as upregulating immune
checkpoint molecules interfering with viral infections. Understanding
hantavirus's antiviral immune evasion mechanisms will deepen our understanding of
its pathogenesis and help us develop more effective methods to control and
eliminate hantavirus.
