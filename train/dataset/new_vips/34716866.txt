BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is the most common cause of chronic liver
disease worldwide. The mechanisms that regulate HBV viral replication remain
poorly defined. Here, we show that blocking of the neddylation elicits antiviral 
effect against HBV replication, indicating that NEDD8 supports viral production.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To explore role of neddylation, HBV-replicating HepG2.2.15.7
cells and HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP-30 cells were treated with siNEDD8 and
MLN4924, a potent and selective NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor. Cell
viability, intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA, covalently closed circular
DNA (cccDNA), HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcrAg were measured to assess the consequences
of the various treatments on viral replication. Our data showed that HBV
infection increased NEDD8 expression in human liver cell lines. Symmetrically,
NEDD8 knockdown by siRNA or MLN4924 treatments decreased HBV replication in
HepG2.2.15.7 and HepG2-hNTCP-30 cells. Notably, HBsAg, and HBeAg secretions were 
strongly suppressed in the culture supernatants, but not the HBcrAg. These
results indicate that the suppression of NEDD8 decreases HBV replication.
However, cccDNA steady level confirms once again its persistence and longevity in
chronic infection.
CONCLUSION: The manipulation of the neddylation pathway can thus provide new
tools interfering with HBV persistence as well as novel therapeutic strategies
against chronic hepatitis B.
