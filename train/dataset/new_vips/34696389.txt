South Tyrol has implemented, in 2007, a mandatory eradication program against
Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV), a virus known to cause economic
losses related to decreases in milk production and milk quality in goats, along
with poor animal welfare and premature death. After a great initial decrease in
the seroprevalence, the program has reached a tailing phase with scattered
positivities. Potential risk factors associated with the multispecies farming
system, a traditional approach in South Tyrol, are evaluated in this study, in
order to better understand some of the potential causes leading to the tailing
phenomenon. A statistically significant number of farms was selected for the
present study, based on the risk factors evaluated. Even though there is no
statistically significant association between the practices evaluated and the
incidence of infection, the authors believe that it is important to highlight
potential risks that may threaten the outcome of this eradication program.
