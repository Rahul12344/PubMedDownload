Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are ubiquitous among children in the
community. A prospective observational study was performed to evaluate the
diagnostic performance and quality of at-home parent-collected (PC) nasal and
saliva swab samples, compared to nurse-collected (NC) swab samples, from children
with RTI symptoms. Children with RTI symptoms were swabbed at home on the same
day by a parent and a nurse. We compared the performance of PC swab samples as
the test with NC swab samples as the reference for the detection of respiratory
pathogen gene targets by reverse transcriptase PCR, with quality assessment using
a human gene. PC and NC paired nasal and saliva swab samples were collected from 
91 and 92 children, respectively. Performance and interrater agreement (Cohen's
κ) of PC versus NC nasal swab samples for viruses combined showed sensitivity of 
91.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.47 to 95.73%) and κ of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79
to 0.88), respectively; the respective values for bacteria combined were 91.4%
(95% CI, 86.85 to 94.87%) and κ of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.89). In saliva
samples, viral and bacterial sensitivities were lower at 69.0% (95% CI, 57.47 to 
79.76%) and 78.1% (95% CI, 71.60 to 83.76%), as were κ values at 0.64 (95% CI,
0.53 to 0.72) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.76), respectively. Quality assessment
for human biological material (18S rRNA) indicated perfect interrater agreement. 
At-home PC nasal swab samples performed comparably to NC swab samples, whereas PC
saliva swab samples lacked sensitivity for the detection of respiratory microbes.
IMPORTANCE RTIs are ubiquitous among children. Diagnosis involves a swab sample
being taken by a health professional, which places a considerable burden on
community health care systems, given the number of cases involved. The
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seen an increase in the at-home 
self-collection of upper respiratory tract swab samples without the involvement
of health professionals. It is advised that parents conduct or supervise swabbing
of children. Surprisingly, few studies have addressed the quality of PC swab
samples for subsequent identification of respiratory pathogens. We compared NC
and PC nasal and saliva swab samples taken from the same child with RTI symptoms,
for detection of respiratory pathogens. The PC nasal swab samples performed
comparably to NC samples, whereas saliva swab samples lacked sensitivity for the 
detection of respiratory microbes. Collection of swab samples by parents would
greatly reduce the burden on community nurses without reducing the effectiveness 
of diagnoses.
