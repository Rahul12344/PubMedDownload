The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed framework of wine purchases
in supermarkets during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unexpected diffusion of the
virus and the restrictions imposed in Italy to prevent its spread have
significantly affected the food purchasing habits of consumers. By analyzing the 
scanner data of the wine sales in the Italian mass market retail channel, this
study was intended to show whether and how the dynamics triggered by the pandemic
have modified the overall value and type of wine purchases, focusing on prices,
formats, and promotional sales. In particular, this study explores sales in two
separate periods, namely March-April (the "lockdown", with general compulsory
closing and severe restrictions) and June-July 2020 (the "post-lockdown", in
which some limitations were no longer effective). The analysis of wine sales
during lockdown and post-lockdown and the study of the variations compared to the
sales of the previous years showed some significant changes in purchase behavior.
The results could provide managers, researchers, and policy makers with extensive
insights into the purchasing patterns of consumers during this unprecedented time
and reveal trends that may characterize the structure of the future wine demand.
