PURPOSE: The study projects the potential impact of COVID-19 on child marriage in
the five countries in which the burden of child marriage is the largest:
Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria.
METHODS: The projected impact of the pandemic on child marriage is based on a
Markov model. A review of empirical and theoretical literature informed
construction and parameter estimates of five pathways through which we expect an 
elevated marriage hazard: death of a parent, interruption of education, pregnancy
risk, household income shocks, and reduced access to programs and services.
Models are produced for an unmitigated scenario and a mitigated scenario in which
effective interventions are applied to reduce the impact.
RESULTS: The total number of excess child marriages in these five countries could
range from 3.5 million to 4.9 million in the unmitigated scenario and from 1.8
million to 2.7 million in the mitigated scenario. The elevated risk compared with
the baseline projection would continue until 2035.
CONCLUSIONS: These projections represent the impact in five countries that
account for 50% of child marriages globally, implying that if similar patterns
hold, we might expect the number of excess child marriages due to the pandemic to
reach 7 million to 10 million globally. These estimates are necessarily subject
to high levels of uncertainty because of limited evidence on the impacts in
relation to child marriage and for parameter estimates. It will likely take years
to understand the full impact of the pandemic. Despite these limitations, the
potential for harm is unquestionably large.
