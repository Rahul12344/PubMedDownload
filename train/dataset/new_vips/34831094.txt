Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects more than 37 million people globally, 
and in 2020, more than 680,000 people died from HIV-related causes. Recently,
these numbers have decrease substantially and continue to reduce thanks to the
use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), thus making HIV a chronic disease state for 
those dependent on lifelong use of ART. However, patients with HIV have an
increased risk of developing some type of cancer compared to patients without
HIV. Therefore, treatment of patients who are diagnosed with both HIV and cancer 
represents a complicated scenario because of the risk associated with drug-drug
interaction (DDIs) and related toxicity. Selection of an alternative chemotherapy
or ART or temporarily discontinuation of ART constitute a strategy to manage the 
risk of DDIs. Temporarily withholding ART is the less desirable clinical plan but
risks and benefits must be considered in each scenario. In this review we focus
on the hepatotoxicity associated with a simultaneous treatment with ART and
chemotherapeutic drugs and mechanisms behind. Moreover, we also discuss the
effect on the liver caused by the association of immunotherapeutic drugs, which
have recently been used in clinical trials and also in HIV patients.
