One approach to protect new-borns against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is to
vaccinate pregnant women in the last trimester of pregnancy. The boosting of
circulating antibodies which can be transferred to the foetus would offer immune 
protection against the virus and ultimately the disease. Since non-human primates
(NHPs) have similar reproductive anatomy, physiology, and antibody architecture
and kinetics to humans, we utilized this preclinical species to evaluate maternal
immunization (MI) using an RSV F subunit vaccine. Three species of NHPs known for
their ability to be infected with human RSV in experimental challenge studies
were tested for RSV-specific antibodies. African green monkeys had the highest
overall antibody levels of the old-world monkeys evaluated and they gave birth to
offspring with anti-RSV titers that were proportional to their mother. These
higher overall antibody levels are associated with greater durability found in
their offspring. Immunization of RSV seropositive AGMs during late pregnancy
boosts RSV titers, which consequentially results in significantly higher titers
in the vaccinated new-borns compared to the new-borns of unvaccinated mothers.
These findings, accomplished in small treatment group sizes, demonstrate a model 
that provides an efficient, resource sparing and translatable preclinical in vivo
system for evaluating vaccine candidates for maternal immunization.
