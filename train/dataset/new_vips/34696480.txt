BACKGROUND: COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been considered
internationally as a treatment option for COVID-19. CCP refers to plasma
collected from donors who have recovered from and made antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. 
To date, convalescent plasma has not been collected in South Africa. As other
investigational therapies and vaccination were not widely accessible, there was
an urgent need to implement a CCP manufacture programme to service South
Africans.
METHODS: The South African National Blood Service and the Western Cape Blood
Service implemented a CCP programme that included CCP collection, processing,
testing and storage. CCP units were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and
neutralising antibodies and routine blood transfusion parameters. CCP units from 
previously pregnant females were tested for anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies.
RESULTS: A total of 987 CCP units were collected from 243 donors, with a median
of three donations per donor. Half of the CCP units had neutralising antibody
titres of >1:160. One CCP unit was positive on the TPHA serology. All CCP units
tested for anti-HLA antibodies were positive.
CONCLUSION: Within three months of the first COVID-19 diagnosis in South Africa, 
a fully operational CCP programme was set up across South Africa. The
infrastructure and skills implemented will likely benefit South Africans in this 
and future pandemics.
