Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020,
millions of people have contracted SARS-CoV-2 and died from the infection.
Several domestic and wild species have contracted the disease as well. From the
beginning, scientists have been working to develop vaccines and establish
therapies that can prevent disease development and improve the clinical outcome
in infected people. To understand various aspects of viral pathogenesis and
infection dynamics and to support preclinical evaluation of vaccines and
therapeutics, a diverse number of animal species have been evaluated for use as
models of the disease and infection in humans. Here, we discuss natural
SARS-CoV-2 infection of domestic and captive wild animals, as well as the
susceptibility of several species to experimental infection with this virus.
