Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was revealed an official pandemic by the World
Health Organization on 11 March 2020. The current pandemic, the third of this
decade, is the worst in terms of suffering and deaths related. COVID-19
represents an unprecedented challenge for medical communities and patients around
the world. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT) is a
fundamental tool in both management and diagnosis of the disease. Imaging plays
an essential role in the diagnosis of all the manifestations of the disease and
its complications and the correct use and interpretation of imaging tests are
essential. Pneumomediastinum has been reported rarely in COVID-19 patients. We
were one of the first groups to share our experiences in uncommon parenchymal
complications of COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum,
but also with new-onset bronchiectasis and cysts. A finding of pneumopericardium 
is also unusual. We hereby report a rare case of spontaneous pneumopericardium in
a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia treated only with a high-flow nasal cannula
(HFNC).
