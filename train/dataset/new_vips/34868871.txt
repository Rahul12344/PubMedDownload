A 71-year-old female patient with B-cell depletion due to treatment with an
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was admitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, she
had persistent viral shedding, worsening respiratory failure, and progressive
pneumonia that did not improve despite dexamethasone and antibiotic therapy.
After administration of bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody with high affinity
for the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, inflammatory
markers rapidly decreased, SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR became negative, and the patient
improved clinically and radiologically. In conclusion, we demonstrated successful
treatment of prolonged COVID-19 in a patient with severe B-cell aplasia with a
virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody.
