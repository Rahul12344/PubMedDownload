Hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) infection amongst Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected

spatially. The present study aimed to evaluate the HDV prevalence in central
India. Samples received from January 2018 to December 2019 were tested for viral 
hepatitis markers. Randomly picked 372 HBsAg positive samples were tested for the
presence of HDV total antibodies using ELISA, of these 8 were found positive.
This study for the first-time documents presence of HDV with 2.1% prevalence from
central India. We recommend screening for better patient management and bringing
