Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease (arboviral) caused by the Dengue virus. 
It is one of the prominent public health problems in tropical and subtropical
regions with no effective vaccines. Every year around 400 million people get
infected by the Dengue virus, with a mortality rate of about 20% among the
patients with severe dengue. The Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family,
and it is an enveloped virus with positive-sense single-stranded RNA as the
genetic material. Studies of the infection cycle of this virus revealed potential
host targets important for the virus replication cycle. Here in this review
article, we will be discussing different stages of the Dengue virus infection
cycle inside mammalian host cells and how host proteins are exploited by the
virus in the course of infection as well as how the host counteracts the virus by
eliciting different antiviral responses.
