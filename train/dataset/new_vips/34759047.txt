Most institutions have mitigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency
education by transitioning to web-based educational platforms and using
innovative solutions, such as surgical video libraries, telehealth clinics,
online question banks via social media platforms, and procedural simulations.
Here, we assess the perceived impact of COVID-19 on Canadian surgical residency
education and discuss the unique challenges in adapting to a virtual format and
how novel training methods implemented during the pandemic may be useful in the
future of surgical education.
