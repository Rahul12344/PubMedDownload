The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all dimensions of lives and has become a
social problem as it continues to spread widely through the continuous
interactions of people in public spaces where they earn a living. Curbing the
spread of COVID-19 requires restrictions in these public spaces, however, the
compliance to these measures depends largely on the understanding and
interpretations of COVID 19 by users of these public spaces. This study examined 
the contextual interpretations of public space users about COVID-19 prevention in
Ibadan Metropolis, Oyo State. The study was a rapid ethnographic survey in
selected public spaces (markets and commercial motor parks) in Ibadan metropolis.
Data were collected through participant observation, key informant interviews (3 
females; 3 males) and in-depth interviews (30) with, traders, head porters,
clients/buyers and commercial vehicle drivers in these public spaces. Interviews 
conducted were transcribed, sorted into themes using Atlas-ti 7.5.7 and subjected
to interpretive-content analysis. Findings revealed that some respondents felt
COVID-19 was brought into Nigeria by rich frequent global voyagers, others felt
it was through "uncultured" sexual life or wrath of God. Some also doubted the
existence of the disease and many of the respondents perceived COVID-19 as a
disease reported by the government or a political propaganda to siphon funds. The
users of the public spaces in Ibadan Metropolis have variegated perception about 
the existence and severity of this rapidly spreading virus and this has grave
implications for COVID-19 control in the State. Thus, regular interaction with
public space users are essential for control efforts.
