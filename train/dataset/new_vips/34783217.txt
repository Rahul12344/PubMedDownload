We used serial rectal swabs to investigate the amount and duration of virus
secretion through the gastrointestinal tract and assessed the association between
fecal shedding and gastrointestinal symptoms and to clarify the clinical
usefulness testing rectal swabs. We enrolled ten adult patients hospitalized with
symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Respiratory and stool specimens 
were collected by physicians. The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction. All ten patients had respiratory symptoms, six had
diarrhea, and seven were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on rectal swabs. The viral loads
in the respiratory specimens was higher than those in the rectal specimens, and
no rectal specimens were positive after the respiratory specimens became
negative. There was no association between gastrointestinal symptoms, pneumonia, 
severity, and rectal viral load. Rectal swabs may play a role in detecting
SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with suspected COVID-19, regardless of gastrointestinal
symptoms.
