INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the medical world to look at
factors that may influence outcomes. There have been connections made between
vitamin D and COVID-19, as vitamin D has previously been shown to play a role in 
the maintenance of immune homeostasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study on 103 patients at
Wigan Wrightington and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust looking at serum vitamin D
levels of patients with positive COVID-19 swabs. Results were collated and
correlations were made to compare vitamin D levels with age; severity of illness;
hospital outcomes; and frailty. Comparisons were also made between frailty and
outcome.
RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant statistical difference
between vitamin D levels and severity of infection: those who were treated in the
intensive care units (ICU) (severe symptoms) had lower vitamin D levels than
those treated on the ward (p=0.0446). There was also a correlation between
vitamin D levels and frailty: those who were more frail had higher vitamin D
levels than fitter patients (P=0.005). Vitamin D and frailty had no effect on
hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSION: Ultimately, we concluded that low vitamin D can increase
susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, increase severity of infection but does
not affect mortality.
