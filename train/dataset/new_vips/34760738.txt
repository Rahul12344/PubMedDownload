Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading throughout the world along
with its strange and frightening mutations, and the World Health Organization
(WHO) has declared it as a global pandemic.
Objective: The present investigation aims to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2
infection on mother and newborn outcomes and the vertical transmission potential 
of this virus.
Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care
dedicated COVID-19 hospital. A total of 40 pregnant females (RT-PCR positive for 
SARS-CoV-2) and their 41 neonates (including stillbirths and a twin delivery)
were included in the present study.
Results: All the mothers in the study were SARS-CoV-2 positive on the RT-PCR
test, but none had any COVID-19 symptoms (pneumonia-like fever, cough, fatigue,
sore throat, shortness of breath, and diarrhea). Out of 41 newborns, 38 (92.7%)
were healthy, one (2.4%) was a stillbirth, and two newborns (4.9%) could not be
revived. All the 41 (100.0%) neonates, including stillborn and preterm were
negative for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Twenty-Six neonates (63.4%) were
delivered by caesarean section, whereas 15 cases (36.6%) had a normal vaginal
delivery.
Conclusion: The present study showed no suggestion of vertical transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant females. Therefore, the placenta might function as a
barrier to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Also, there were no complications come upon
during the delivery of any neonate in the present study.
