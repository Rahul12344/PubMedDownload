Background Sero-surveillance to find the presence of IgG antibodies among
COVID-19 cases helps in the better understanding of the immune response after
COVID-19 infection. Objectives To estimate seropositivity among confirmed
COVID-19 cases and to correlate the seropositivity with various factors affecting
seropositivity. Methods Population-based sero-surveillance among COVID-19 cases
was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the
COVID KAVACH, Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) Antibody Detection Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits. Seropositivity among cases was measured and
compared with various other factors to understand the immunity status among
COVID-19 cases. Results With 1073 positive for IgG antibodies from 1720 samples, 
the seropositivity among COVID-19 cases is 62.38% [95%CI 60.07-64.64%]. The
difference in seropositivity based on gender was statistically not significant
(Z=0.26, P=0.79). Children have the highest seropositivity (94.44%) and from
young adults, to the elderly, the proportion of positivity among cases shows an
increasing trend. Time gap analysis from the date of diagnosis shows that the
proportion of cases with IgG antibodies increases gradually reaching its peak at 
around 10 weeks (third month) and then declines gradually. Conclusion
Seropositivity among COVID-19 cases is 62.38%. The proportion of cases with IgG
antibodies reaches its peak at around 10 weeks (third month) after diagnosis and 
then declines gradually. This fall indicates that the detected antibodies may not
be long-lasting and may become undetectable/absent over a period of time. The
reason for seronegative results in COVID-19 cases needs further in-depth
scientific research.
