As the number of people vaccinated increases, people who complain of adverse
reactions continue to occur. We experienced a case characterized by low blood
pressure, persistent fever, edema due to increased systemic vascular
permeability, and systemic inflammation confirmed by image and laboratory
examinations after ChAdOx1 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The
diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in adults are
known as fever of 3 days or more in adults, 2 or more
mucocutaneous/gastrointestinal/neurologic symptoms, elevation of inflammatory
markers, and clinical/imaging diagnosis of heart failure. A 67-year-old man who
was medicated for hypertension and diabetes was admitted complaining of fever,
maculopapular rash, diarrhea, headache, chills, and dizziness 6 days after the
first vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Korea. The COVID-19 test was negative but
with low blood pressure, leukocytosis, skin rash, pulmonary edema, and increased 
inflammation markers. His lab findings and clinical course were consistent with
those of MIS after COVID-19 vaccination. He was medicated with methylprednisolone
1 mg/kg and diuretics and recovered rapidly. He was discharged after 2 weeks and 
confirmed cure at outpatient clinic. We report an MIS case after COVID-19
vaccination in Korea.
