Introduction: Post-liver transplantation (LTx) bone diseases have been poorly
investigated. The frequency of bone diseases (osteopenia and osteoporosis) after 
LTx is unknown.
Aim of the study: To define prevalence and risk factors of bone disorders
following LTx.
Material and methods: This prospective study was conducted on 100 consecutive
adult patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) at the
National Liver Institute (NLI) and survived longer than a year. Bone mineral
density (BMD) was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorption (DEXA), as well as
other pre- and postoperative risk factors.
Results: The frequencies of osteopenia and osteoporosis were found to be 14% and 
8% among post-LTx patients. Seven recipients of the osteoporotic group were
males, with mean age, and body mass index (BMI) before and after LTx 49.5 ±7.4
years, 24.1 ±4.7 kg/m2 and 22.8 ±1.5 kg/m2, respectively. A significant
association between hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, liver disease
severity according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, and alcoholism with
decreased post-LTx BMD was substantiated (p < 0.05, 0.006). Post-LTx development 
of diabetes mellitus (DM), weight gain, use of corticosteroids and basiliximab
all significantly affected decreased post-LTx BMD (p < 0.05). However, binary
regression revealed that post-LTx occurrence of DM (p = 0.012, odds ratio [OR] = 
0.099), the severity of liver disease (p = 0.023, OR = 0.217), and HCV (p =
0.011, OR = 0.173) are the main independent predictors of metabolic bone disease 
(MBD) occurrence one year after LTx.
Conclusions: Post-LTx bone disorders are not infrequent complications and should 
be more considered in those with HCV-related severe liver disease or developed DM
after LTx.
