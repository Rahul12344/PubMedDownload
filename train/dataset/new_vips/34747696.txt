Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for monitoring the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a scalable
analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immuno-affinity
enrichment combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is
a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by
LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab media from combined
throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples. The results reveal that the levels of
SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their correspondingreal-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) read-out (r = 0.79). The analytical workflow
shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a
quantitative read-out of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct)
equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate
that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated
specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when
analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct
within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct ≤ 30). These results
suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future
pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.
