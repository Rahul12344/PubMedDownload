The severity of COVID-19 has been observed throughout the world as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally claimed more than 2
million lives and left a devastating impact worldwide. Recently several virulent 
mutant strains of this virus, such as the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 lineages, have
emerged with initial predominance in UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Another
extremely pathogenic B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages, first detected in
India, are now affecting some countries at notably stronger spread-rates. The
present paper computationally examines the time-based structures of B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, and P1 lineages with selected spike protein mutations. The mutations in 
the more recently found B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages are explored, and
the implications for multiple point mutations of the spike protein's
receptor-binding domain (RBD) are described. The selected S1 mutations within the
highly contagious B.1.617.2 sub-lineage, also known as the delta variant, are
examined as well.
