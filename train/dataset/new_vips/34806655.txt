Human herpesviruses, particularly the varicella-zoster virus, are notorious for
affecting the central nervous system, especially when secondarily reactivated
from a latent state. We present one such case of zoster radiculitis with an
ensemble of typical dermatological and neurological features diagnosed on imaging
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies and encourage the consideration of viral
(zoster) neuritis as a differential in patients presenting with radicular pain.
