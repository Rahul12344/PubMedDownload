The safety and utility of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to modulate target gene
expression has been well demonstrated, and AAV vectors are a leading gene therapy
platform. However, manufacturing presents challenges in terms of productivity and
scalability as compared to incumbent therapeutic modalities. In particular, a
pivot from adherent cell- to suspension culture-based AAV manufacturing processes
requires enhanced study of the transfection step. For the method proposed herein,
a Response Surface Design of Experiments is suggested to explore the role of five
transfection factors-cell density at transfection, DNA concentration, ratio of
complexing reagent to DNA, and molar ratios of the transfecting
plasmids-influencing viral genome titer and biological potency. Additionally, an 
AAV categorical factor matrix is presented for developing a workflow to
interrogate the impact of AAV permutations for different capsid serotypes,
harbored genes of interest, and inverted terminal repeat configurations on
transfection process parameters.
