African Swine Fever (ASF) has emerged as a major threat to domestic and wild suid
populations, and its continued spread threatens commercial swine production
worldwide. The causative agent of ASF, African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV),
possesses a linear, double stranded DNA genome. Traditional detection of ASFV
relies on laboratory-based virus isolation or real time PCR of samples, typically
blood or spleen, obtained from suspect cases. While effective, these
methodologies are not easily field deployable, a major limitation during disease 
outbreak and response management scenarios. In this report, we evaluated the
MatMaCorp Solas 8® ASFV detection system, a field deployable DNA extraction and
fluorescent detection device, for its ability to extract and detect ASFV from
multiple sample types obtained from domestic swine experimentally infected with
ASFV strain Georgia. We found that the MatMaCorp Solas 8® ASFV detection device, 
and affiliated MagicTip™ DNA extraction and C-SAND™ assay kits, readily detected 
ASFV in blood and spleen, as well as other sample types, including pinna, liver, 
skin, muscle, and bone marrow. This article is protected by copyright. All rights
