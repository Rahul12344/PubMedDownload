RSK1, a downstream kinase of the MAPK pathway, has been shown to regulate
multiple cellular processes and is essential for lytic replication of a variety
of viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Besides
phosphorylation, it is not known whether other post-translational modifications
play an important role in regulating RSK1 function. We demonstrate that RSK1
undergoes robust SUMOylation during KSHV lytic replication at lysine residues
K110, K335, and K421. SUMO modification does not alter RSK1 activation and kinase
activity upon KSHV ORF45 co-expression, but affects RSK1 downstream substrate
phosphorylation. Compared to wild-type RSK1, the overall phosphorylation level of
RxRxxS*/T* motif is significantly declined in RSK1K110/335/421R expressing cells.
Specifically, SUMOylation deficient RSK1 cannot efficiently phosphorylate eIF4B. 
Sequence analysis showed that eIF4B has one SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) between 
the amino acid position 166 and 170 (166IRVDV170), which mediates the association
between eIF4B and RSK1 through SUMO-SIM interaction. These results indicate that 
SUMOylation regulates the phosphorylation of RSK1 downstream substrates, which is
required for efficient KSHV lytic replication.
