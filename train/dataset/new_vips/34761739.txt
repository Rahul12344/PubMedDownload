This is a case report of a young healthcare worker with a mild case of COVID-19
during the first wave in 2020 with no initial triggering of antibody response.
The second episode of symptomatic infection of the patient with symptoms of
moderate COVID-19, occurred eight months later in the beginning of the second
surge in Denmark. It is the first reported case of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
reinfection in Denmark, and it illustrates the possibility of reinfection with a 
more severe course of COVID-19 after an initial natural infection also among
young immunocompetent individuals.
