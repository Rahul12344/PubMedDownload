Background: Cervical cancer - caused by persistent High Risk Human Papilloma
Virus (HR HPV) infections - is the second most common cancer affecting women
globally. HIV infection increases the risk for HPV persistence, associated
disease progression and malignant cell transformation. We therefore hypothesized 
that this risk increase is directly linked to HIV infection associated
dysfunction or depletion of HPV-oncoprotein-specific T-cell responses.
Methods: The 2H study specifically included HIV+ and HIV- women with and without 
cervical lesions and cancer to analyze HPV oncogene-specific T cell responses in 
relation to HPV infection, cervical lesion status and HIV status. Oncoprotein E6 
and E7 specific T-cell responses were quantified for the most relevant types
HPV16, 18 and 45 and control antigens (CMV-pp65) and M.tb-PPD in 373 women, using
fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells in an IFN-γ release ELISpot assay.
Results: Overall, systemic E6- and E7-oncoprotein-specific T-cell responses were 
infrequent and of low magnitude, when compared to CMV-pp65 and M.tb-PPD (p <
0.001 for all HR HPV types). Within HIV negative women infected with either
HPV16, 18 or 45, HPV16 infected women had lowest frequency of
autologous-type-E6/E7-specific T-cell responses (33%, 16/49), as compared to
HPV18 (46% (6/13), p = 0.516) and HPV45 (69% (9/13), p = 0.026) infected women.
Prevalent HPV18 and 45, but not HPV16 infections were linked to detectable
oncoprotein-specific T-cell responses, and for these infections, HIV infection
significantly diminished T-cell responses targeting the autologous infecting
genotype. Within women living with HIV, low CD4 T-cell counts, detectable HIV
viremia as well as cancerous and precancerous lesions were significantly
associated with depletion of HPV oncoprotein-specific T-cell responses.
Discussion: Depletion of HPV-oncoprotein-specific T-cell responses likely
contributes to the increased risk for HR HPV persistence and associated
cancerogenesis in women living with HIV. The low inherent immunogenicity of HPV16
oncoproteins may contribute to the exceptional potential for cancerogenesis
associated with HPV16 infections.
