The novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving across the world with 
the potential of increasing its transmission and the induced disease. Here, we
applied the CRISPR-Cas12a system to detect, without the need of sequencing,
SARS-CoV-2 genomes harboring the E484K mutation, first identified in the Beta
variant and catalogued as an escape mutation. The E484K mutation creates a
canonical protospacer adjacent motif for Cas12a recognition in the resulting DNA 
amplicon, which was exploited to obtain a differential readout. We analyzed a
series of fecal samples from hospitalized patients in Valencia (Spain), finding
one infection with SARS-CoV-2 harboring the E484K mutation, which was then
confirmed by sequencing. Overall, these results suggest that CRISPR diagnostics
can be a useful tool in epidemiology to monitor the spread of escape mutations.
