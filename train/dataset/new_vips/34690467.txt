SARS-CoV2 is a member of human coronaviruses and is the causative agent of the
present pandemic COVID-19 virus. In order to control COVID-19, studies on viral
structure and mechanism of infectivity and pathogenicity are sorely needed. The
spike (S) protein is comprised of S1 & S2 subunits. These spike protein subunits 
enable viral attachment by binding to the host cell via ACE-2 (angiotensin
converting enzyme-2) receptor, thus facilitating the infection. During viral
entry, one of the key steps is the cleavage of the S1-S2 spike protein subunits
via surface TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) and results in viral
infection. Hence, the S-protein is critical for the viral attachment and
penetration into the host. The rapid advancement of our knowledge on the
structural and functional aspects of the spike protein could lead to development 
of numerous candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Here the authors discuss about 
the structure of spike protein and explore its related functions. Our aim is to
provide a better understanding that may aid in fighting against CoVID-19 and its 
treatment.
