The availability of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) sparked efforts to eliminate 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Australia. We evaluated whether an educational
intervention of a 1-h discussion among staff using audit and feedback data from
the MedicineInsight GP programme would improve DAA uptake. Of 296 eligible
general practices in MedicineInsight, 11% opted out. Randomization stratified by 
practice caseload allocated 130 practices to the intervention arm and 129 to
control. The primary outcome was the number of patients started on DAAs over
6 months using the negative binomial regression model adjusted for DAA
prescription history and clustering by practice. Data for analysis were available
for 78% of practices, which included 101 practices and 2469 DAA-naive patients
with confirmed/possible HCV in the intervention arm, and 100 practices and 2466
patients in the control arm. At baseline, 49.5% of practices had prescribed ≥1
DAA in the past year; 18.9% of HCV patients had already been treated with DAAs;
the mean age of DAA-naive HCV patients was 43 years old, and 57% were men. Over
6 months, 43 patients in the intervention arm and 36 in the control arm started
DAAs (adjusted IRR 1.19; 95% CI 0.67-2.11, p = 0.55). In the first 3 months, 27
vs 16 patients started DAAs (adjusted IRR 1.77, 0.88-3.58; p = 0.111). Few
patients were started on DAAs, and a facilitated discussion in HCV management did
not lead to a significant increase. Alternative measures, such as incentivizing
GP initiations or patients, are suggested to address remaining barriers to DAA
uptake in Australian primary care. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry
