Background: The usefulness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in
identifying pathogens is being investigated. We aimed to compare the power of
microbial identification between mNGS and various methods in patients with acute 
respiratory failure.
Methods: We reviewed 130 patients with respiratory failure, and 184 specimens
including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), sputum, pleural effusion,
ascitic fluid, and urine were tested by mNGS and conventional methods (culture,
PCR). We also enrolled 13 patients to evaluate the power of mNGS and pathogen
targets NGS (ptNGS) in microbial identifications. Clinical features and microbes 
detected were analyzed.
Results: mNGS outperformed the conventional method in the positive detection rate
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (OR, ∞; 95% CI, 1-∞; P < 0.05), bacteria (OR,
3.7; 95% CI, 2.4-5.8; P < 0.0001), fungi (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.7-7.2; P < 0.0001),
mycoplasma (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 31.8-115; P = 0.005), and virus (OR, ∞; 95% CI,
180.7-∞; P < 0.0001). We showed that 20 patients (28 samples) were detected with 
Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) by mNGS, but not by the conventional
method, and most of those patients were immunocompromised. Read numbers of
Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), P. jirovecii, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) in BALF were higher than those in other sample
types, and the read number of Candida albicans (C. albicans) in blood was higher 
than that in BALF. We found that orotracheal intubation and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) were associated with a higher detection rate of bacteria and
virus by mNGS, immunosuppression was associated with a higher detection rate of
fungi and virus by mNGS, and inflammatory markers were associated with
mNGS-positive detection rate of bacteria. In addition, we observed preliminary
results of ptNGS.
Conclusion: mNGS outperformed the conventional method in the detection of MTB,
bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and virus. Orotracheal intubation, T2DM,
immunosuppression, and inflammatory markers were associated with a higher
detection rate of bacteria, fungi, and virus by mNGS. In addition, ptNGS results 
were consistent with the detection of abundant bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma in
our specimens.
