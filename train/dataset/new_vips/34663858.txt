Differential kinetics of RNA loads and infectious viral levels in the upper
respiratory tract between asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected adult 
outpatients remain unclear limiting recommendations that may guide clinical
management, infection control measures and occupational health decisions. In the 
present investigation, 496 (2.8%) of 17,911 French adult outpatients were
positive for an upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by a
quantitative RT-PCR assay, of which 180 (36.3%) were COVID-19 asymptomatic. Of
these adult asymptomatic viral shedders, 75% had mean to high RNA viral loads (Ct
values < 30) which median value was significantly higher than that observed in
symptomatic subjects (P = 0.029), and 50.6% were positive by cell culture assays 
of their upper respiratory tract specimens. Our findings indicate that COVID-19
asymptomatic adult outpatients are significant viable SARS-CoV-2 shedders in
their upper respiratory tract playing a major potential role as SARS-CoV-2
transmitters in various epidemiological transmission chains, promoting COVID-19
resurgence in populations.
