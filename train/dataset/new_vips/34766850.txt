the COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Aftermath at a Tertiary Care Center in Michigan.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on the presentation and management of acute, primary
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, consecutive case series with
historic controls, examining patients during the COVID-19 "stay-at-home" order
(March 24 to June 1, 2020), the subsequent reopening phase (June 1 to July 31,
2020), and corresponding preceding intervals (March 24 to July 31, 2016 to 2019).
RESULTS: Despite a significant increase in patients presenting with macula-off
RRD during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to the 2016 to 2019 timeframe (P =
.03), the rate of single surgery anatomical success was similar between all
groups (P = .66), as was final visual acuity (P = .61). No delays between
presentation and surgical intervention were observed during the lockdown (P =
.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the COVID-19 lockdown, patients underwent
surgery in a timely manner and achieved comparable visual outcomes to controls
before COVID-19. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2021;52:593-600.].
