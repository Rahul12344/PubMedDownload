Necrosis that appears at the ischemic distal end of random-pattern skin flaps
increases the pain and economic burden of patients. Necroptosis is thought to
contribute to flap necrosis. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) plays an
indispensable role in the regulation of necroptosis. Nonetheless, the mechanisms 
by which lysosomal membranes become leaky and the relationship between
necroptosis and lysosomes are still unclear in ischemic flaps. Based on Western
blotting, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis results, we found that LMP was 
presented in the ischemic distal portion of random-pattern skin flaps, which
leads to disruption of lysosomal function and macroautophagic/autophagic flux,
increased necroptosis, and aggravated necrosis of the ischemic flaps. Moreover,
bioinformatics analysis of the LC-MS results enabled us to focus on the role of
PLA2G4E/cPLA2 (phospholipase A2, group IVE) in LMP of the ischemic flaps. In vivo
inhibition of PLA2G4E with an adeno-associated virus vector attenuated LMP and
necroptosis, and promoted flap survival. In addition, microRNA-seq helped us
determine that Mir504-5p was differentially expressed in ischemic flaps. A string
of in vitro and in vivo tests was employed to verify the inhibitory effect of
Mir504-5p on PLA2G4E, LMP and necroptosis. Finally, we concluded that the
inhibition of PLA2G4E by Mir504-5p reduced LMP-induced necroptosis, thereby
promoting the survival of random-pattern skin flaps.
