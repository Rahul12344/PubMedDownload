Several single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies analyzing immune response 
to COVID-19 infection have been recently published. Most of these studies have
small sample sizes, which limits the conclusions that can be made with high
confidence. By re-analyzing these data in a standardized manner, we validated 8
of the 20 published results across multiple datasets. In particular, we found a
consistent decrease in T-cells with increasing COVID-19 infection severity,
upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathways, presence of expanded B-cell
clones in COVID-19 patients but no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion.
Overall, our results show that the conclusions drawn from scRNA-seq data analysis
of small cohorts of COVID-19 patients need to be treated with some caution.
