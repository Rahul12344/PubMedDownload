Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is a global pandemic that can have a
long‑lasting impact on public health if not properly managed. Ongoing vaccine
development trials involve classical molecular strategies based on inactivated or
attenuated viruses, single peptides or viral vectors. However, there are multiple
issues, such as the risk of reversion to virulence, inability to provide
long‑lasting protection and limited protective immunity. To overcome the
aforementioned drawbacks of currently available COVID‑19 vaccines, an alternative
strategy is required to produce safe and efficacious vaccines that impart
long‑term immunity. Exosomes (key intercellular communicators characterized by
low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility and innate cargo‑loading capacity)
offer a novel approach for effective COVID‑19 vaccine development. An engineered 
exosome‑based vaccine displaying the four primary structural proteins of
SARS‑CoV‑2 (spike, membrane, nucleocapside and envelope proteins) induces humoral
and cell mediated immunity and triggers long‑lasting immunity. The present review
investigated the prospective use of exosomes in the development of COVID‑19
vaccines; moreover, exosome‑based vaccines may be key to control the COVID‑19
pandemic by providing enhanced protection compared with existing vaccines.
