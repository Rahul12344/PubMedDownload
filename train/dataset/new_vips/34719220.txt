Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has infected many people around the
world. Children are considered an important target group for SARS-CoV-2, as well 
as other viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus infection. Both
SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus can affect the respiratory tract.
Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus can pose significant
challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment in children. This review compares 
the symptoms, diagnostic methods, and treatment of COVID-19 and respiratory
syncytial virus infection in children.
