The sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP)-S267F
variant is known to be associated with a reduced risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection and disease progression. The NTCP-S267F variant displays diminished
function in mediating HBV entry, but its function in HBV infection has not been
fully established in more biologically relevant models. We introduced the
NTCP-S267F variant and tested infectivity by HBV in genetically edited hepatic
cells. HepG2-NTCP clones with both homozygous and heterozygous variants were
identified after CRISPR base editing. NTCP-S267F homozygous clones did not
support HBV infection. The heterozygote clones behaved similarly to wild-type
clones. We generated genetically edited human stem cells with the NTCP-S267F
variant, which differentiated equally well as wild-type into hepatocyte-like
cells (HLCs) expressing high levels of hepatocyte differentiation markers. We
confirmed that HLCs with homozygous variant did not support HBV infection, and
heterozygous variant clones were infected with HBV equally as well as the
wild-type cells. In conclusion, we successfully introduced the S267F variant by
CRISPR base editing into the NTCP/SLC10A gene of hepatocytes, and showed that the
variant is a loss-of-function mutation. This technology of studying genetic
variants and their pathogenesis in a natural context is potentially valuable for 
therapeutic intervention against HBV.
