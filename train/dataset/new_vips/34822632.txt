The detection capacity of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus
(PRRSV) in tongues from dead animals in breeding herds (stillborns and piglets
dying during the lactating period) and nursery farms (naturally dead animals) for
PRRSV surveillance was evaluated. The samples were selected if pairs of serum and
tongues were available from 2018 to 2020. Serum (pools of five) and exudate from 
tongues (one bag) were analyzed by PRRSV RT-PCR. The agreement between the serum 
sample procedure versus tongues exudate was assessed using a concordance test
(Kappa statistic) at batch level. A total of 32 submissions, corresponding to 14 
farms, had PRRSV diagnostic information for serum and tongues exudate. The
overall agreement of batch classification as positive or negative, based on
RT-PCR PRRSV results, between serum and tongue exudate of the 32 pairs was 76.9%.
Cohen's Kappa was 0.55. The main discrepancy came from the presence of positive
samples in tongues exudate and not in serum, suggesting that tongue exudate to
monitor PRRSV seems to be more sensitive than serum. These results suggest that
this sample procedure could be also used for PRRSV surveillance and monitoring.
