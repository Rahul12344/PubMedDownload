Many challenges, such as virus infection, extreme weather and long cultivation
periods, during the development of fish larvae have been observed, especially in 
aquaculture. Gene delivery is a useful method to express functional genes to
defend against these challengers. However, the methods for fish larvae are
insufficient. In our earlier report, low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWCS) showed
a strong positive charge and may be useful for polyplex formulation. Herein, we
present a simple self-assembly of LMWCS polyplexes (LMWCSrNPs) for gene delivery 
into zebrafish larvae. Different weight ratios of LMWCS/gamma-polyglutamic acid
(γ-PGA)/plasmid DNA were analyzed by gel mobility assay. Delivery efficiency
determined by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in zebrafish liver (ZFL)
cells showed that delivery efficiency at a weight ratio of 20:8:1 was higher than
others. Zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed
that the round shape of the particle size varied. In our earlier reports, IRF9S2C
could induce interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to induce innate
immunity in zebrafish and pufferfish. Further delivery of pcDNA3-IRF9S2C-HA
plasmid DNA into ZFL cells and zebrafish larvae by LMWCSrNP successfully induced 
ISG expression. Collectively, LMWCSrNP could be a novel gene delivery system for 
zebrafish larvae and might be used to improve applications in aquaculture.
