The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) delivers high yield heterologous 
protein expression and is widely used in academic and industrial R&D. The
proteins produced enable many applications including structure/function analysis,
drug screening and manufacture of protein therapeutics. Vital cellular functions 
are controlled by multi-protein complexes, MultiBac, a BEVS specifically designed
for heterologous multigene delivery and expression, has unlocked many of these
machines to atomic resolution studies. Baculovirus can accommodate very large
foreign DNA cargo for faithful delivery into a target host cell, tissue or
organism. Engineered MultiBac variants exploit this valuable feature for delivery
of customized multifunctional DNA circuitry in mammalian cells and for production
of virus-like particles for vaccines manufacture. Here, latest developments and
applications of the MultiBac system are reviewed.
