A quarter of all seasonal influenza cases are caused by type B influenza virus
(IBV) that also dominates periodically. Here, we investigated a recombinant
adenovirus vaccine carrying a synthetic HA2 representing the consensus sequence
of all IBV hemagglutinins. The vaccine fully protected mice from lethal
challenges by IBV of both genetic lineages, demonstrating its breadth of
protection. The protection was not mediated by neutralizing antibodies but robust
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune responses.
Complete protection of the animals required the entire codon-optimized HA2
sequence that elicited a balanced immune response, whereas truncated vaccines
without either the fusion peptide or the transmembrane domain reduced the
efficacy of protection. Finally, the vaccines did not demonstrate any sign of
disease exacerbation following lung pathology and morbidity monitoring.
Collectively, these data suggest that it could be worth further exploring this
prototype universal vaccine because of its considerable efficacy, safety, and
breadth of protection.
