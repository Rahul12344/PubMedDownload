Reactivation ofHepatitis B virus (HBV) is not an uncommon condition. It is known 
to occur with immunosuppressive therapy. There are several viral infections that 
can trigger HBV reactivation, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. However, there is no reported case of HBV reactivation triggered by
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the literature. To our knowledge, we report
the first case of reactivation of HBV secondary to acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
infection in the literature. A 47-year-old Caucasian male with a remote history
of resolved acute Hepatitis B virus infection presented to our hospital with
severe acute hepatitis, which manifested as epigastric pain, jaundice, dark
urine, light-colored stools, hyperbilirubinemia, and transaminitis in the 1000s. 
Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with reactivation of HBV triggered by acute
EBV infection. After several days of supportive treatment, his hepatic function
normalized. He was discharged with a scheduled follow-up at a hepatology clinic. 
In conclusion, EBV infection should be suspected as a trigger in cases with HBV
reactivation, particularly when common etiologies are excluded.
