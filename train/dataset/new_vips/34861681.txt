The high incidence of thrombotic events suggests a possible role of the contact
system pathway in COVID-19 pathology. Here, we demonstrate altered levels of
factor XII (FXII) and its activation products in critically ill COVID-19 patients
in comparison to patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to 
influenza virus (ARDS-influenza). Compatible with this data, we report rapid
consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma.
Interestingly, the lag phase in fibrin formation, triggered by the FXII activator
kaolin, was not prolonged in COVID-19 as opposed to ARDS-influenza. Using
confocal and electron microscopy, we showed that increased FXII activation rate, 
in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of
fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in
COVID-19. Accordingly, clot lysis was markedly impaired in COVID-19 as opposed to
ARDS-infleunza subjects. Dysregulatated fibrinolytic system, as evidenced by
elevated levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor,
tissue-plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in COVID-19
potentiated this effect. Analysis of lung tissue sections revealed wide-spread
extra- and intra-vascular compact fibrin deposits in COVID-19 patients. Together,
compact fibrin network structure and dysregulated fibrinolysis may collectively
contribute to high incidence of thrombotic events in COVID-19.
