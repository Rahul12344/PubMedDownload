Risk groups for mucormycosis include persons with immunosuppressed immune system 
and uncontrolled diabetes. The patients suffering from corona virus or post covid
patients have been found to be entrapped with this fungal infection due to
suppression in the immune system. Also the major attack was reported in those
patients who were in Intensive Care units. It arises due to the fungal infection 
of various species and can occur simultaneously with covid. The development of
black fungus mostly affects lungs, eyes, brain, and skin and is not at all
contagious. Proper diagnostic can only predict that the patient is in invasive
attack of which mucor species. It is better to take prevention by wearing
medicated masks, hand gloves, wearing glasses, avoid dusty and damp places.
