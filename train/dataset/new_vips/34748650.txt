BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are commonly
recognized in atopic dermatitis (AD) but less is known about other types of
infections.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of herpesvirus infections, serious infections, 
and opportunistic infections in patients with AD.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using UK-based electronic
medical records data. Patients with AD were each matched to up to 5 unaffected
patients on age, practice, and index date. AD severity was defined using
treatments. The outcomes were incident herpesvirus infections (cytomegalovirus
[CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], HSV, or varicella zoster virus [VZV]), serious
infections, and opportunistic infections.
RESULTS: 409,431 children and 625,083 adults with AD were matched to 1,809,029
children and 2,678,888 adults without AD, respectively. In adjusted Cox
regression models, children and adults with AD had 50-52% greater risk of HSV and
18-33% greater risk of VZV, with risk increasing in parallel with AD severity.
CMV risk was elevated among children with AD (HR 2.50 [1.38-4.54]) and adults
with severe AD (4.45 [1.76-11.25]). Patients with AD had 26-40% increase in risk 
of serious infections, with severe AD carrying greatest risk. Although rare,
opportunistic infections were not associated with AD in children but were
associated with all severities of AD in adults (overall HR 1.31 [1.20-1.42]). All
estimates remained consistent after excluding patients receiving
immunosuppressive treatments for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: AD is significantly associated with herpesvirus infections, serious 
infections, and opportunistic infections in a dose-responsive manner with
severity. AD may increase susceptibility to infections exclusive of
immunosuppressive medications.
