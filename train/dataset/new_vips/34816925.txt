OBJECTIVE: There are limited data about the significance of erythrocyte
sedimentation rate as a single prognostic parameter for the prognosis and
mortality of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic utility of 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate as a prognostic factor for the disease severity
and mortality in patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 and hospitalized at the intensive care unit or non-the intensive care
unit were included in the study. The patients were allocated to groups as
severe/critical disease versus nonsevere disease and survivors and nonsurvivors. 
The prognostic role and predictable values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate were
analyzed.
RESULTS: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be higher among patients
with severe/critical disease compared to those with nonsevere disease (p<0.001)
and among nonsurvivors compared to survivors (p<0.001). The logistic regression
analysis showed that erythrocyte sedimentation rate was an independent parameter 
for predicting disease severity and mortality. The role of erythrocyte
sedimentation rate in the assessment of severity and mortality in patients with
COVID-19 was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic curve and was
found to be significant in both. The analyses suggested that the optimum
erythrocyte sedimentation rate cutoff point for disease severity and mortality
were 52.5 mm/h with 65.5% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity and 56.5 mm/h with
66.7% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that erythrocyte sedimentation rate was an
independent prognostic factor for severity and mortality in patients with
COVID-19.
