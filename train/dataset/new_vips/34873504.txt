Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly progressive
neurodegenerative disease caused by the measles virus. This study investigated
the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in SSPE by retrospective review of 
two cases diagnosed by typical periodic electroencephalographic (EEG) features,
clinical symptoms and elevated measles antibody titre in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). MRI revealed lesions of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images
involving the periventricular or subcortical white matter in both the
patients. Both these patients were given sodium valproate for seizures. However, 
the disease proved fatal in both these cases eventually.
