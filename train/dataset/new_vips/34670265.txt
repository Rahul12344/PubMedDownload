PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), also called inborn
errors of immunity (IEI), are genetic disorders classically characterized by an
increased susceptibility to infection and/or disruption in the regulation of an
immunologic pathway. This review summarizes and highlights the new IEI disorders 
in the IUIS 2019 report and 2020 interim report and discusses the directions for 
the future management of PIDs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2017, the International Union of Immunologic Societies
(IUIS) IEI committee has updated the IUIS classification of IEIs with 88 new gene
defects and 75 new immune disorders. The increased utilization of genetic testing
and advances in the strategic evaluation of genetic variants have identified, not
only novel IEI disorders, but additional genetic causes for known IEI disorders. 
Investigation of potential immune susceptibilities during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic suggests that defects in Type I interferon signalling may underlie more 
severe disease.
SUMMARY: The rapid discovery of new IEIs reflects the growing trend of applying
genetic testing modalities as part of medical diagnosis and management.In turn,
elucidating the pathophysiology of these novel IEIs have enhanced our
understanding of how genetic mutations can modulate the immune system and their
consequential effect on human health and disease.
