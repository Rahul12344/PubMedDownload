Murine norovirus (MNV) was used as a surrogate for human viral pathogens (e.g.,
norovirus) to determine if toilet flushing resulted in the aerosolization of
virus. A flushometer type toilet was seeded with a viral solution of 105 and 106 
PFU mL-1 of MNV and then flushed. Upon flushing, two bioaerosol samplers were
activated to collect aerosolized MNV. Prior to the experiment, two optical
particle counters monitored particle size and number distribution of aerosol
produced from flushing a toilet across height, position, and side. The location
with the highest mean particle concentration, was behind the toilet and 0.15 m
above the toilet bowl rim, which is where bioaerosol sampling occurred.
Bioaerosol and toilet water samples were collected, extracted and then quantified
using RT-ddPCR. The concentration of MNV collected after seeding the toilet water
ranged from 2.18 × 105 to 9.65 × 106 total copies of MNV. Positive samples of
airborne MNV were detected with collected concentrations ranging from 383 to 684 
RNA copies/m3 of air. This study provides evidence that viral pathogens may be
aerosolized when a toilet is flushed. Furthermore, the MNV used in this study is 
a model organism for human norovirus and may be generalizable to other viral
pathogens (e.g., coronavirus). This study suggests that virus is aerosolized from
toilet flushing and may contribute to human exposure to viral pathogens.
