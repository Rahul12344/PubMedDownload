Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections result in significant morbidity and 
mortality for young children worldwide. The development of preventive strategies 
for RSV has faced different challenges, including the legacy of the first vaccine
attempt, and an incomplete understanding of the host immune response to the
virus. However, promising preventive strategies against RSV are in the pipeline
and their development has advanced rapidly in the past decade due in part to our 
improved knowledge about the structural conformation of key RSV proteins. These
strategies include monoclonal antibodies and different vaccines platforms
directed towards the main target populations.
