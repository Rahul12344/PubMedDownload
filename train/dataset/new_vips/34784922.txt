BACKGROUND: Model-based estimates of measles burden and the impact of
measles-containing vaccine (MCV) are crucial for global health priority setting. 
Recently, evidence from systematic reviews and database analyses have improved
our understanding of key determinants of MCV impact. We explore how
representations of these determinants affect model-based estimation of
vaccination impact in ten countries with the highest measles burden.
METHODS: Using Dynamic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), we
modelled the effect of evidence updates for five determinants of MCV impact:
case-fatality risk, contact patterns, age-dependent vaccine efficacy, the
delivery of supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) to zero-dose children,
and the basic reproduction number. We assessed the incremental vaccination impact
of the first (MCV1) and second (MCV2) doses of routine immunisation and SIAs,
using metrics of total vaccine-averted cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) over 2000-2050. We also conducted a scenario capturing the
effect of COVID-19 related disruptions on measles burden and vaccination impact.
RESULTS: Incorporated with the updated data sources, DynaMICE projected 253
million measles cases, 3.8 million deaths and 233 million DALYs incurred over
2000-2050 in the ten high-burden countries when MCV1, MCV2, and SIA doses were
implemented. Compared to no vaccination, MCV1 contributed to 66% reduction in
cumulative measles cases, while MCV2 and SIAs reduced this further to 90%. Among 
the updated determinants, shifting from fixed to linearly-varying vaccine
efficacy by age and from static to time-varying case-fatality risks had the
biggest effect on MCV impact. While varying the basic reproduction number showed 
a limited effect, updates on the other four determinants together resulted in an 
overall reduction of vaccination impact by 0.58%, 26.2%, and 26.7% for cases,
deaths, and DALYs averted, respectively. COVID-19 related disruptions to measles 
vaccination are not likely to change the influence of these determinants on MCV
impact, but may lead to a 3% increase in cases over 2000-2050.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating updated evidence particularly on vaccine efficacy and 
case-fatality risk reduces estimates of vaccination impact moderately, but its
overall impact remains considerable. High MCV coverage through both routine
immunisation and SIAs remains essential for achieving and maintaining low
incidence in high measles burden settings.
