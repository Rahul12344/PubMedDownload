INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID-19 complications require simultaneous characterisation
and management to plan policy and health system responses. We describe the
12-month experience of the first UK dedicated post-COVID-19 clinical service to
include hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients.
METHODS: In a single-centre, observational analysis, we report the demographics, 
symptoms, comorbidities, investigations, treatments, functional recovery,
specialist referral and rehabilitation of 1325 individuals assessed at the
University College London Hospitals post-COVID-19 service between April 2020 and 
April 2021, comparing by referral route: posthospitalised (PH), non-hospitalised 
(NH) and post emergency department (PED). Symptoms associated with poor recovery 
or inability to return to work full time were assessed using multivariable
logistic regression.
RESULTS: 1325 individuals were assessed (PH: 547, 41.3%; PED: 212, 16%; NH: 566, 
42.7%). Compared with the PH and PED groups, the NH group were younger (median
44.6 (35.6-52.8) years vs 58.3 (47.0-67.7) years and 48.5 (39.4-55.7) years),
more likely to be female (68.2%, 43.0% and 59.9%), less likely to be of ethnic
minority (30.9%, 52.7% and 41.0%) or seen later after symptom onset (median
(IQR): 194 (118-298) days, 69 (51-111) days and 76 (55-128) days; all p<0.0001). 
All groups had similar rates of onward specialist referral (NH 18.7%, PH 16.1%
and PED 18.9%, p=0.452) and were more likely to require support for
breathlessness (23.7%, 5.5% and 15.1%, p<0.001) and fatigue (17.8%, 4.8% and
8.0%, p<0.001). Hospitalised patients had higher rates of pulmonary emboli,
persistent lung interstitial abnormalities and other organ impairment. 716
(54.0%) individuals reported <75% optimal health (median 70%, IQR 55%-85%). Less 
than half of employed individuals could return to work full time at first
assessment.
CONCLUSION: Post-COVID-19 symptoms were significant in PH and NH patients, with
significant ongoing healthcare needs and utilisation. Trials of interventions and
patient-centred pathways for diagnostic and treatment approaches are urgently
required.
