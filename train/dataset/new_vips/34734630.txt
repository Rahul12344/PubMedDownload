Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; Togaviridae, Alphavirus) is an
arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) primarily maintained in an enzootic cycle
between Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) and passerine birds. EEEV, which has the
highest reported case- fatality rate among arbovirus in the Americas, is
responsible for sporadic outbreaks in the Eastern and Midwest United States.
Infection is associated with severe neurologic disease and mortality in horses,
humans, and other vertebrate hosts. Here, we review what is known about EEEV
taxonomy, functional genomics, and evolution, and identify gaps in knowledge
regarding the role of EEEV genetic diversity in transmission and disease.
