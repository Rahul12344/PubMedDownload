Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) caused an acute and highly contagious
infectious disease, resulting in considerable economic losses in the world
poultry industry. Although this disease was well-controlled under the widely use 
of commercial vaccines, the novel variant IBDV strain emerged due to the highly
immunized-selection pressure in the field, posting new threats to poultry
industry. Here, we reported the epidemic and pathogenicity of IBDV in Hubei
Province from May to August 2020. We isolated 12 IBDV strains from the broiler
flocks, including 9 novel variants, 2 very virulent strains and 1 medium virulent
strain. Interestingly, we identified a series of changes of amino acid sites in
the VP2. Further analysis indicated that the novel variant IBDV strains caused
damage to bursa of fabricius and spleen, leading to immunosuppression. Our
findings underscore the importance of IBDV surveillance, and provide evidence for
understanding the evolution of IBDV.
