Many medically important viruses are enveloped viruses, which are surrounded by a
structurally conserved, host-derived lipid membrane coating. Agents that target
and disrupt this membrane coating could potentially function as broad-spectrum
antiviral drugs. The amphipathic Î±-helical (AH) peptide derived from the
N-terminus of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein is one such candidate and has
been demonstrated to be able to selectively rupture lipid vesicles in the size
range of viruses (<160 nm diameter). However, the mechanism underlying this
membrane curvature selectivity remains elusive. In this study, we have performed 
molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of the AH peptide to model
membranes that are stretched to resemble the looser lipid headgroup packing
present on highly curved outer membranes of nanoscale vesicles. We found that the
AH peptide binds more favorably to membranes that are stretched. In addition, a
tetrameric placement of peptides across the membrane induced stable pore
formation in the stretched membrane. Thus, our results suggest that the AH
peptide senses the high curvature of nanoscale vesicles via the enhanced exposure
of lipid packing defects induced by membrane area strain.
