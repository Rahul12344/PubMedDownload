Since the introduction of ultrasonography, clinicians have discovered different
uses for embedding this technology in the clinical setting. The use of
point-of-care ultrasonography has gained a lot of interest in the emergency
department. It is a procedure that a clinician can rapidly utilize to triage,
risk stratify, evaluate, and monitor the patient's condition. The COVID-19
pandemic has highlighted the significance and application of ultrasonography in
identifying and managing patients presenting with lung pathology in the emergency
setting.
