Infection with flaviviruses causes mild to severe diseases, including viral
hemorrhagic fever, vascular shock syndrome, and viral encephalitis. Several
animal models explore the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis, as shown by neuron 
destruction due to neurotoxicity after viral infection. While neuronal cells are 
injuries caused by inflammatory cytokine production following
microglial/macrophage activation, the blockade of inflammatory cytokines can
reduce neurotoxicity to improve the survival rate. This study investigated the
involvement of macrophage phenotypes in facilitating CNS inflammation and
neurotoxicity during flavivirus infection, including the Japanese encephalitis
virus, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus. Mice infected with different
flaviviruses presented encephalitis-like symptoms, including limbic seizure and
paralysis. Histology indicated that brain lesions were identified in the
hippocampus and surrounded by mononuclear cells. In those regions, both the
infiltrated macrophages and resident microglia were significantly increased.
RNA-seq analysis showed the gene profile shifting toward type 1 macrophage (M1)
polarization, while M1 markers validated this phenomenon. Pharmacologically
blocking C-C chemokine receptor 2 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± partly retarded
DENV-induced M1 polarization. In summary, flavivirus infection, such as JEV and
DENV, promoted type 1 macrophage polarization in the brain associated with
encephalitic severity.
