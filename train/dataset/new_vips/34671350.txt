Mass SARS-Cov-2 vaccination campaign represents the only strategy to defeat the
global pandemic we are facing. Immunocompromised patients represent a vulnerable 
population at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and thus should be
prioritized in the vaccination programs and in the study of the vaccine efficacy.
Nevertheless, most data on efficacy and safety of the available vaccines derive
from trials conducted on healthy individuals; hence, studies on immunogenicity of
SARS-CoV2 vaccines in such populations are deeply needed. Here, we perform an
observational longitudinal study analyzing the humoral and cellular response
following the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients affected by 
inborn errors of immunity (IEI) compared to healthy controls (HC). We show that
both IEI and HC groups experienced a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs 
1 week after the second scheduled dose as well as an overall statistically
significant expansion of the Ag-specific CD4+CD40L+ T cells in both HC and IEI.
Five IEI patients did not develop any specific CD4+CD40L+ T cellular response,
with one of these patients unable to also mount any humoral response. These data 
raise immunologic concerns about using Ab response as a sole metric of protective
immunity following vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these findings
suggest that evaluation of vaccine-induced immunity in this subpopulation should 
also include quantification of Ag-specific T cells.
