The COVID-19 pandemic poses many real-world moral dilemmas, which can pit the
needs and rights of the many against the needs and rights of the few. We
investigated moral judgments in the context of the contemporary global crisis
among older adults, who are at greatest personal risk from the pandemic. We
hypothesized that during this pandemic, individuals would give fewer utilitarian 
responses to hypothetical dilemmas, accompanied by higher levels of confidence
and emotion elicitation. Our pre-registered analysis (https://osf.io/g2wtp)
involved two waves of data collection, before (2014) and during (2020) the
COVID-19 pandemic, regarding three categories of moral dilemmas (personal rights,
agent-centered permissions, and special obligations). While utilitarian responses
considered across all categories of dilemma did not differ, participants during
the 2020 wave gave fewer utilitarian responses to dilemmas involving personal
rights; that is, they were less willing to violate the personal rights of others 
to produce the best overall outcomes.
