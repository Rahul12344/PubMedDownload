Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can become complicated by secondary invasive 
fungal infections (IFIs), stemming primarily from severe lung damage and
immunologic deficits associated with the virus or immunomodulatory therapy. Other
risk factors include poorly controlled diabetes, structural lung disease and/or
other comorbidities, and fungal colonization. Opportunistic IFI following severe 
respiratory viral illness has been increasingly recognized, most notably with
severe influenza. There have been many reports of fungal infections associated
with COVID-19, initially predominated by pulmonary aspergillosis, but with recent
emergence of mucormycosis, candidiasis, and endemic mycoses. These infections can
be challenging to diagnose and are associated with poor outcomes. The reported
incidence of IFI has varied, often related to heterogeneity in patient
populations, surveillance protocols, and definitions used for classification of
fungal infections. Herein, we review IFI complicating COVID-19 and address
knowledge gaps related to epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of
COVID-19-associated fungal infections.
