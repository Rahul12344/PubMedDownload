Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can independently replicate in the central
nervous system (CNS) causing neurocognitive impairment even in subjects with
suppressed plasma viral load. The antiretroviral drug darunavir (DRV) has been
approved for therapy of HIV-infected patients, but its efficacy in the treatment 
of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND) is limited due to the low
penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, innovations in DRV 
formulations, based on its encapsulation in optically traceable nanoparticles
(NPs), may improve its transport through the BBB, providing, at the same time,
optical monitoring of drug delivery within the CNS. The aim of this study was to 
synthesize biodegradable polymeric NPs loaded with DRV and luminescent, nontoxic 
carbon dots (C-Dots) and investigate their ability to permeate through an
artificial BBB and to inhibit in vitro matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) that
represents a factor responsible for the development of HIV-related neurological
disorders. Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)-based
nanoformulations resulted characterized by an average hydrodynamic size less than
150 nm, relevant colloidal stability in aqueous medium, satisfactory drug
encapsulation efficiency, and retained emitting optical properties in the visible
region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The assay on the BBB artificial model
showed that a larger amount of DRV was able to cross BBB when incorporated in the
PLGA NPs and to exert an enhanced inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) expression levels with respect to free DRV. The overall results reveal
the great potential of this class of nanovectors of DRV for an efficacious
treatment of HANDs.
