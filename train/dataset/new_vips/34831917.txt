Loneliness has been defined as an agonizing encounter, experienced when the need 
for human intimacy is not met adequately, or when a person's social network does 
not match their preference, either in number or attributes. This definition helps
us realize that the cause of loneliness is not merely being alone, but rather not
being in the company we desire. With loneliness being introduced as a measurable,
distinct psychological experience, it has been found to be associated with poor
health behaviors, heightened stress response, and inadequate physiological
repairing activity. With these three major pathways of pathogenesis, loneliness
can do much harm; as it impacts both immune and metabolic regulation, altering
the levels of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, acute-phase reactants,
chemokines, immunoglobulins, antibody response against viruses and vaccines, and 
immune cell activity; and affecting stress circuitry, glycemic control, lipid
metabolism, body composition, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular function,
cognitive function and mental health, respectively. Taken together, there are too
many immunologic and metabolic manifestations associated with the construct of
loneliness, and with previous literature showcasing loneliness as a distinct
psychological experience and a health determinant, we propose that loneliness, in
and of itself, is not just a psychosocial phenomenon. It is also an
all-encompassing complex of systemic alterations that occur with it, expanding it
into a syndrome of events, linked through a shared network of immunometabolic
pathology. This review aims to portray a detailed picture of loneliness as an
"immunometabolic syndrome", with its multifaceted pathology.
