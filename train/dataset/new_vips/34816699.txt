BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver failure and liver
transplantation. The known risk factors of this disease include blood
transfusion, injection drug use, high risk sexual behaviors, tattoos, and use of 
shared blades and syringes. Due to the higher risk of viral hepatitis among
people in prison, this study was done to find the seroprevalence of hepatitis C
virus (HCV) and associated risk factors in Lakan Prison in Rasht.
METHODS: Prisoners in Lakan Prison underwent a cross-sectional study in 2018. A
questionnaire containing demographic information and risk factors was distributed
to the inmates and they were asked complete them. High-risk individuals were
selected and a blood sample was taken and tested. Data were collected and
analyzed by SPSS18 software.
RESULTS: Out of 2215 prisoners, 1238 people had at least one risk factor, of whom
408 individuals were selected by random sampling. One hundred inmates were
positive for anti-HCV antibody, yielding a prevalence of 24.5% (95% CI:
20.4%-28.7%) of whom 42.6% were people who injected drugs and 4 cases were found 
positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen, yielding a 1% prevalence (95% CI,
0.2%-2%.). A history of injecting drug use (OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.55-7.17), and
previous history of imprisonment (OR 2.94, 95% CI: 1.34-6.53) had association
with HCV infection.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that hepatitis C is prevalent in prisons and 
preventive and screening programs should be implemented with necessary training
for inmates.
