OBJECTIVE: To summarise the comparative risk of infection in school staff and
their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
DESIGN: Systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses guideline.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, WHO COVID-19 database and preView were searched on 29
January 2021.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies that reported risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection in school staff or transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was done in duplicates. Data
synthesis was qualitative. We report attack rates and infection risk in school
settings for staff and students stratified by control measures taken and
infection dynamics at the point of data collection.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included. Three studies in low incidence settings 
showed low attack rates similar for teachers and students. Five studies in medium
incidence settings and two studies in high incidence settings showed secondary
attack rates up to 16% in school staff.Seroprevalence studies, two in each low
and high incidence settings showed an infection risk of 0%-0.2% and 1.7%-28% for 
teachers.The risk of infection for teachers compared with students were similar
in one study in low incidence setting, higher in three studies (RR 1.2-4.4) and
lower in three studies in medium to high incidence settings. The risk of
infection for teachers in a high infection environment is higher in face-to-face 
than in distance classes when compared with general population groups. The risk
of infections as well as risk of hospitalisation both increased for teachers
during school openings compared with school closure.
CONCLUSION: While in low incidence settings there is little evidence for school
staff to be at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in high incidence settings
there is an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in school staff teaching
face-to-face compared to staff teaching digitally and general population.
