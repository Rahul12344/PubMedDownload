The mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is distributed unevenly
worldwide. One of the major causes is hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection 
and the development and progression of liver cirrhosis. The carcinogenesis of HCC
is among others regulated via the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)
signaling pathway and represents a possible method of targeted treatment. The aim
of our article was to address the most recent clinical advances and findings of
basic studies on the mTOR signaling pathway and the involved factors. Risk
factors play a key role in dysregulation of the signaling pathway, where both
mTORCs are upregulated and protein synthesis is altered. eIFs and, to a lesser
extent, eEFs play an essential role in this process. Whether the factor will be
upregulated or downregulated, among others, depends on hepatitis B/C virus
infection. The amount of a particular factor in a patient sample lets us know
whether HCC recurrence will occur, what is the likelihood of chemoresistance, and
what outcome is predicted for patients with an increased value. Our analysis
shows that in addition to mTOR, eIF3, eIF4, and eIF5 play an important role, as
they can serve as biomarkers for non- and virus-related HCC.
