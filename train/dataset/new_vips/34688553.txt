PURPOSE: This longitudinal investigation assessed how the frequency of
parent-adolescent conversations about COVID-19, moderated by adolescents' stress,
influenced adolescents' empathic concern and adherence to health protective
behaviors (HPBs) throughout the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Participants were 181 adolescents (Mage = 15.23 years; 51% girls; 47%
Latinx) and their parents. Frequency of parent-adolescent conversations about
COVID-19 (i.e., pandemic-related symptoms, health behaviors, and social effects),
empathic concern toward vulnerable others, and adolescent HPBs were assessed via 
surveys in the first months of the pandemic, and empathic concern and HPBs were
assessed again nine months later.
RESULTS: Results revealed that more frequent parent-adolescent conversations
early in the pandemic predicted increased adherence to HPBs throughout the
pandemic when adolescents reported low stress (direct effect), but conversation
frequency predicted decreased adherence to HPBs via reduced empathic concern when
adolescents reported high stress (indirect effect).
CONCLUSIONS: Parents and other socialization agents, such as teachers, should be 
sensitive to adolescents' stress before engaging them in frequent conversations
about the pandemic to mitigate the potential negative impact these conversations 
may have on adolescents' empathic concern and adherence to HPBs. Decreasing
adolescents' stress may be an initial step in promoting effective message
transference. Collective action (including wearing masks and receiving the
vaccine) remains critical to overcoming COVID-19. The current study contributes
to our understanding of the processes underlying adolescents' adherence to
recommended HPBs, which is critical as pandemic fatigue and stress continue to
rise.
