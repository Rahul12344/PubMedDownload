Introduction: During an epidemic, screening processes can play a crucial role in 
limiting the spread of the infection. The aim of this study was to describe the
epidemiological profile of COVID-19 suspected cases and to evaluate the
performance of the triage process in predicting COVID-19 in Southern Tunisia.
Methods: It was a prospective study including all patients consulting to the Hedi
Chaker University Hospital departments from March to June 2020. A clinical triage
score (CTS) was used to assess the risk of the infection and to refer patients to
the appropriate part of the facility accordingly.
Results: Overall, 862 patients were enrolled, among whom 505 patients (58.6%)
were classified as suspected cases (CTS ≥4). Of these, 46.9% (n = 237) were of
mild form. Samples were collected from 215 patients (24.9%), among whom five were
COVID-19 positive, representing a positive rate of 2.3%. The in-hospital
cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 was 580/100000 patients. The total daily
incidence decreased significantly during the study period (p < 0.001, chi-square 
for linear trend = 25.6). At a cut-off of four, the CTS had a sensitivity of 40%,
a specificity of 32.4%, and negative and positive predictive values of 95.8% and 
1.4%, respectively.
Discussion: Although the triage process based on the CTS was not as performant as
the RT-PCR, it was crucial to interrupt virus spread among hospitalized patients 
in "COVID-19-free departments".
