Phleboviruses (order Bunyavirales, family Phenuiviridae) are globally emerging
arboviruses with a wide spectrum of virulence. Sandfly fever Sicilian virus
(SFSV) is one of the most ubiquitous members of the genus Phlebovirus and
associated with a self-limited, incapacitating febrile disease in travellers and 
military troops. The phleboviral NSs protein is an established virulence factor, 
acting as antagonist of the antiviral interferon (IFN) system. Consistently, we
previously reported that SFSV NSs targets the induction of IFN mRNA synthesis by 
specifically binding to the DNA-binding domain of the IFN transcription factor
IRF3. Here, we further characterized the effect of SFSV and its NSs towards IFN
induction, and evaluated its potential to affect the downstream IFN-stimulated
signalling and the subsequent transactivation of antiviral interferon-stimulated 
genes (ISGs). We found that SFSV dampened, but did not entirely abolish type I
and type III IFN induction. Furthermore, SFSV NSs did not affect IFN signalling, 
resulting in substantial ISG expression in infected cells. Hence, although SFSV
targets IRF3 to reduce IFN induction, it is not capable of entirely disarming the
IFN system in the presence of high basal IRF3 and/or IRF7 levels, and we
speculate that this significantly contributes to its low level of virulence.
