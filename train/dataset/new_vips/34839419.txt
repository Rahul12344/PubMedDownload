Baculoviruses are circular double-stranded DNA viruses that infect insects and
are widely used as the baculoviral expression vectors (BEVs), which provide a
eukaryotic milieu for heterologous expression. The most frequently used vector is
based on Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). However, 
purification of recombinant proteins produced using BEVs is laborious,
time-consuming, and often expensive. Numerous strategies have been explored to
facilitate purification of heterologous proteins, such as fusion with occlusion
body (OBs)-forming proteins like polyhedrin (Polh). Baculoviruses produce OBs in 
the late stages of infection to protect the virion in the cellular environment,
and the main protein responsible for OB formation is Polh. In this study, we
investigated the effect of fusing the gene that encodes the surface antigen
(S-HBsAg) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to either the N- or C-terminus of the AcMNPV
Polh. The production of recombinant viruses and recombinant proteins was
confirmed, and the ability to form chimeric S-HBsAg-containing OBs was accessed
by light and scanning electron microscopy of infected cells. The fusion was found
to affect the shape and size of the OBs when compared to wild-type OBs, with the 
N-terminal fusion producing less-amorphous OBs than the C-terminal construct. In 
addition, the N-terminal construct gave higher levels of expression than the
C-terminal construct. Quantitative and qualitative immunoassays with human serum 
or plasma antibodies against HBsAg showed that the two forms of the antigen
reacted differently. Although both reacted with the antibody, the N-terminal
fusion protein reacted with more sensitivity (2.27-fold) and is therefore more
suitable for quantitative assays than the C-terminal version. In summary, the
BEVs represents a promising tool for the production of reagents for the diagnosis
of HBV infection.
