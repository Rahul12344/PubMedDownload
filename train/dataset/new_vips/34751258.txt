The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to lead to high morbidity and
mortality. During pregnancy, severe maternal and neonatal outcomes and placental 
pathological changes have been described. We evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection at the
maternal-fetal interface using precision-cut slices (PCSs) of human placenta.
Remarkably, exposure of placenta PCSs to SARS-CoV-2 leads to a full replication
cycle with infectious virus release. Moreover, the susceptibility of placental
tissue to SARS-CoV-2 replication relates to the expression levels of ACE2. Viral 
proteins and/or RNA are detected in syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblasts,
villous stroma, and possibly Hofbauer cells. While SARS-CoV-2 infection of
placenta PCSs does not cause a detectable cytotoxicity nor a pro-inflammatory
cytokine response, an upregulation of one order of magnitude of interferon type
III transcripts is measured. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the capacity of 
SARS-CoV-2 to infect and propagate in human placenta and constitute a basis for
further investigation of SARS-CoV-2 biology at the maternal-fetal interface.
