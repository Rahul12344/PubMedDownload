Purpose of Review: In this article, we review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on refractive surgery.
Recent Findings: COVID-19 infection frequently causes eye symptoms, most commonly
conjunctivitis or mild irritation. While virus can be detected in tears of
symptomatic patients, the risk of transmission via this route appears low.
Summary: Refractive surgery consultations were significantly reduced during the
pandemic; however, volume is rebounding quickly likely due to a number of
lifestyle, health, and financial factors. Laser refractive and intraocular
surgery likely confer a low risk of virus spread, especially in asymptomatic
patients. Screening prior to the refractive consultation and surface disinfection
in the clinic and operating room can help reduce transmission risk further.
