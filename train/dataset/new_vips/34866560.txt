To assess the burden of respiratory virus co-infections with SARS-CoV-2, this
study reviewed 4,818 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and tested using
respiratory virus multiplex testing. Co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were uncommon 
(2.8%), with rhinovirus/enterovirus as the most prevalent target (88.1%).
Respiratory virus co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 remain low one-year into the
pandemic.
