CRISPR-Cas are adaptive immune systems that protect their hosts against viruses
and other parasitic mobile genetic elements.1 Although widely distributed among
prokaryotic taxa, CRISPR-Cas systems are not ubiquitous.2-4 Like most
defense-system genes, CRISPR-Cas are frequently lost and gained, suggesting
advantages are specific to particular environmental conditions.5 Selection from
viruses is assumed to drive the acquisition and maintenance of these immune
systems in nature, and both theory6-8 and experiments have identified phage
density and diversity as key fitness determinants.9,10 However, these approaches 
lack the biological complexity inherent in nature. Here, we exploit metagenomic
data from 324 samples across diverse ecosystems to analyze CRISPR abundance in
natural environments. For each metagenome, we quantified viral abundance and
diversity to test whether these contribute to CRISPR-Cas abundance across
ecosystems. We find a strong positive association between CRISPR-Cas abundance
and viral abundance. In addition, when controlling for differences in viral
abundance, CRISPR-Cas systems are more abundant when viral diversity is low,
suggesting that such adaptive immune systems may offer limited protection when
required to target a diverse viral community. CRISPR-Cas abundance also differed 
among environments, with environmental classification explaining roughly a
quarter of the variation in CRISPR-Cas relative abundance. The relationships
between CRISPR-Cas abundance, viral abundance, and viral diversity are broadly
consistent across environments, providing robust evidence from natural ecosystems
that supports predictions of when CRISPR is beneficial. These results indicate
that viral abundance and diversity are major ecological factors that drive the
selection and maintenance of CRISPR-Cas in microbial ecosystems.
