OBJECTIVE: To analyze the underdiagnosis of COVID-19 through nowcasting with
machine learning in a Southern Brazilian capital city.
METHODS: Observational ecological design and data from 3916 notified cases of
COVID-19 from April 14th to June 2nd, 2020 in Florianópolis, Brazil. A
machine-learning algorithm was used to classify cases that had no diagnosis,
producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, the difference between data
without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire
period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms were compared.
RESULTS: The number of new cases throughout the entire period without nowcasting 
was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (95%CI 496-897). During the six-day period, 
the number without nowcasting was 19 and 104 (95%CI 60-142) with nowcasting. The 
underdiagnosis was 37.29% in the entire period and 81.73% in the six-day period. 
The underdiagnosis was more critical in the six days from the date of onset of
symptoms to diagnosis before the data collection than in the entire period.
CONCLUSION: The use of nowcasting with machine learning techniques can help to
estimate the number of new disease cases.
