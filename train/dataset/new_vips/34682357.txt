We aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence rates
of mental health symptoms among major African populations during the COVID-19
pandemic. We include articles from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and 
medRxiv between 1 February 2020 and 6 February 2021, and pooled data using
random-effects meta-analyses. We identify 28 studies and 32 independent samples
from 12 African countries with a total of 15,071 participants. The pooled
prevalence of anxiety was 37% in 27 studies, of depression was 45% in 24 studies,
and of insomnia was 28% in 9 studies. The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety,
depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are
higher than those in Sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively). We
find (a) a scarcity of studies in several African countries with a high number of
COVID-19 cases; (b) high heterogeneity among the studies; (c) the extent and
pattern of prevalence of mental health symptoms in Africa is high and differs
from elsewhere-more African adults suffer from depression rather than anxiety and
insomnia during COVID 19 compared to adult populations in other
countries/regions. Hence, our findings carry crucial implications and impact
future research to enable evidence-based medicine in Africa.
