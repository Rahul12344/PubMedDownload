Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has
disrupted social and economic life globally. The global pandemic COVID-19 caused 
by this novel SARS-CoV-2 shows variable clinical manifestations, complicated
further by cytokine storm, co-infections, and coagulopathy, leading to severe
cases and death. Thrombotic complications arise due to complex and unique
interplay between coronaviruses and host cells, inflammatory response, and the
coagulation system. Heparin and derivatives are World Health Organization (WHO)
recommended anticoagulants for moderate and severe Corona Virus Disease 19
(COVID-19), that can also inhibit viral adhesion to the cell membrane by
interfering with heparan sulfate-dependent binding to angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Heparin also possesses anti-inflammatory,
immunomodulatory, antiviral, and anti-complement activity, which offers a benefit
in limiting viral and microbial infectivity and anticoagulation from the
immune-thrombosis system. Here we present a case study of the pathophysiology of 
unexpected COVID-19 coagulopathy of an obese African American patient. While
being on therapeutic warfarin since admission, he had a dismal outcome due to
cardio-pulmonary arrest after the sudden rise in D-dimer value from 1.1 to >20.
This indicates that for such patients on chronic warfarin anticoagulation with
"moderate COVID 19 syndromes", warfarin anticoagulation may not be suitable
compared to heparin and its derivatives. Further research should be done to
understand the beneficial role of heparin and its derivatives compared to
warfarin for COVID-19 inflicted patients.
