In the face of the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to
develop a vaccine that can induce fast, effective, long-lasting and broad
protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 
S protein vaccine candidate adjuvanted by PIKA, which can induce robust cellular 
and humoral immune responses. The results showed a high level of neutralizing
antibodies induced by the vaccine was maintained for at least 400 days. In the
study of non-human primates, PIKA adjuvanted S-trimer induced high SARS-CoV-2
neutralization titers and protected from virus replication in the lung following 
SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In addition, the long-term neutralizing antibody response
induced by S-trimer vaccine adjuvanted by PIKA could neutralize multiple
SARS-CoV-2 variants and there is no obvious different among the SARS- CoV-2
variants of interest or concern, including B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.617.1 and
B.1.617.2 variants. These data support the utility of S-trimer protein adjuvanted
by PIKA as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2
infection.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary
