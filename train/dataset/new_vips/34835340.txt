To help control the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we
developed a diagnostic method targeting the spike protein of the virus that
causes the infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). We applied an ultrasensitive method by combining a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the thio-nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling reaction to quantify spike S1 proteins. The limit
of detection (LOD) was 2.62 × 10-19 moles/assay for recombinant S1 proteins and
2.6 × 106 RNA copies/assay for ultraviolet B-inactivated viruses. We have already
shown that the ultrasensitive ELISA for nucleocapsid proteins can detect
ultraviolet B-inactivated viruses at the 104 RNA copies/assay level, whereas the 
nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to distinguish from those in
conventional coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Thus, an antigen test for only the
nucleocapsid proteins is insufficient for virus specificity. Therefore, the use
of a combination of tests against both spike and nucleocapsid proteins is
recommended to increase both the detection sensitivity and testing accuracy of
the COVID-19 antigen test. Taken together, our present study, in which we
incorporate S1 detection by combining the ultrasensitive ELISA for nucleocapsid
proteins, offers an ultrasensitive, antigen-specific test for COVID-19.
