BACKGROUND/AIM: The importance of compliance with National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) guidelines for preventing varicella-zoster virus reactivation
(VZVr) in multiple myeloma (MM) in a clinical setting has not been well
investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of 118 patients with MM treated with proteasome inhibitors.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine episodes of VZVr were observed in 37 patients (VZVr group). 
The proportion of prophylactic antiviral prescriptions and compliance with
antiviral prophylaxis based on the NCCN Clinical Practice guidelines was 76% and 
30% in the VZVr group, and 88% and 74% in the non-VZVr group, respectively.
Multivariate analysis showed that compliance with the NCCN guidelines was the
only independent risk factor for VZVr (p=0.0017).
CONCLUSION: It is important that prophylactic antivirals are prescribed for an
appropriate duration of time to prevent the reactivation of VZV in compliance
with existing guidelines.
