Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 235
million individuals and led to more than 4.8 million deaths worldwide as of
October 5 2021. Cryo-electron microscopy and topology show that the SARS-CoV-2
genome encodes lots of highly glycosylated proteins, such as spike (S), envelope 
(E), membrane (M), and ORF3a proteins, which are responsible for host
recognition, penetration, binding, recycling and pathogenesis. Here we reviewed
the detections, substrates, biological functions of the glycosylation in
SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as the human receptor ACE2, and also summarized the
approved and undergoing SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics associated with glycosylation.
This review may not only broad the understanding of viral glycobiology, but also 
provide key clues for the development of new preventive and therapeutic
methodologies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
