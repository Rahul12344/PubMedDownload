BACKGROUND: Potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) commonly occur because of
aging and comorbidities in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 
PLWH). Protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
have been reported to cause PDDIs in these patients. However, there are few
reports of PDDIs in the era of treatment using integrase strand transfer
inhibitors. Therefore, we investigated PDDIs in Japanese PLWH receiving
antiretroviral drugs (ARVs).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Japanese
outpatients. All eligible patients who had received ARV therapy for at least
48 weeks were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PDDIs detected 
using the Lexicomp® interface.
RESULTS: Of the 71 eligible patients, 51 (71.8%) were prescribed concomitant
non-ARV medications. In 21 patients (29.6%), PDDIs with the potential to reduce
the effects of ARVs occurred, although the HIV load was suppressed in all cases. 
Polypharmacy (the use of ≥5 non-ARVs) was observed in 25 patients (35.2%). There 
was a significantly higher median number of non-ARV medications in the PDDI group
than in the non-PDDI group (6 vs. 3, P <  0.001). Furthermore, the proportion of 
patients on polypharmacy was significantly higher in those with PDDIs than in
those without PDDIs (81.0% vs. 26.7%, P <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PDDIs is relatively high in Japanese PLWH, even in 
the era of treatment using integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Therefore, it is
important for patients and health care providers to be constantly aware of PDDIs 
associated with ARV treatment.
