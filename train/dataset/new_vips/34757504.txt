In the present study we report the identification of a novel partitivirus
recovered from Miscanthus sinensis, for which the provisional name "silvergrass
cryptic virus 1" (SgCV-1) is proposed. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) and rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) allowed the assembly of the complete sequence
of each double-stranded RNA genome segment of this novel virus. The largest dsRNA
segment, dsRNA1 (1699 bp), was predicted to encode a viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase protein (RdRp) with 478 aa, and dsRNA2 (1490 bp) and dsRNA3 (1508 bp) 
were predicted to encode putative capsid proteins (CPs) with 347 and 348 aa,
respectively. SgCV-1 has the highest amino acid sequence identity (≤ 70.80% in
RdPp and ≤ 34.5% in CPs) to members of the genus Deltapartitivirus, family
Partitiviridae, especially to unclassified viruses related to members of this
genus. Its genome segment and protein lengths are also within the range of those 
of deltapartitiviruses. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis based on RdRp amino acid 
sequences also showed clustering of this novel virus with the related
unclassified deltapartitiviruses. An RT-PCR survey of 94 imported M. sinensis
samples held in quarantine identified seven additional samples carrying SgCV-1.
This new virus fulfils all ICTV criteria to be considered a new member of the
genus Deltapartitivirus.
