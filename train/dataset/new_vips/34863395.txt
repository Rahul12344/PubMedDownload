OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of influenza and noninfluenza respiratory
viruses (NIRVs) pre-/post-implementation of public health measures aimed to
decrease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission using population-based 
surveillance data. We hypothesized that such measures could reduce the burden of 
respiratory viruses (RVs) transmitting via the same routes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An interrupted time-series analysis of RV surveillance data
in Alberta, Canada, from May 2017 to July 2020 was conducted. The burden of
influenza and NIRVs before and after intervention initiation at week 11 was
compared. The analysis was adjusted for seasonality, overdispersion, and
autocorrelation.
RESULTS: During the study period, an average of 708 and 4056 weekly respiratory
multiplex molecular panels were conducted pre-/post-intervention, respectively.
We found significant reductions in test positivity rates in the postintervention 
period for influenza (-94.3%; 95% CI, -93.8 to 97.4%; P<.001) and all NIRVs
(-76.5%; 95% CI, -77.3 to -75.8%; P<.001) in the crude model, and -86.2% (95% CI,
-91.5 to -77.4%: P<.001) and -75% (95% CI, -79.7 to -69.3%; P<.001),
respectively, in the adjusted models. Subanalyses for individual viruses showed
significant decreases in respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus,
enterovirus/rhinovirus, and parainfluenza. For non-severe acute respiratory
coronavirus 2 human coronaviruses, the decline was not statistically significant 
after adjustment (-22.3%; 95% CI, -49.3 to +19%, P=.246).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of COVID-19 public health measures likely resulted
in reduced transmission of common RVs. Although drastic lockdowns are unlikely to
be required given widespread COVID-19 vaccination, targeted implementation of
such measures can lower RV disease burden. Studies to evaluate relative
contributions of individual interventions are warranted.
