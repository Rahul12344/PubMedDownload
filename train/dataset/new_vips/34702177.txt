BACKGROUND: The survival of coronaviruses are influenced by weather conditions
and seasonal coronaviruses are more common in winter months. We examine the
seasonality of respiratory infections in England and Wales and the associations
between weather parameters and seasonal coronavirus cases.
METHODS: Respiratory virus disease data for England and Wales between 1989 and
2019 was extracted from the Second-Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) database
used for routine surveillance. Seasonal coronaviruses from 2012 to 2019 were
compared to daily average weather parameters for the period before the patient's 
specimen date with a range of lag periods.
RESULTS: The seasonal distribution of 985,524 viral infections in England and
Wales (1989-2019) showed coronavirus infections had a similar seasonal
distribution to influenza A and bocavirus, with a winter peak between weeks 2 to 
8. Ninety percent of infections occurred where the daily mean ambient
temperatures were below 10 °C; where daily average global radiation exceeded
500 kJ/m2/h; where sunshine was less than 5 h per day; or where relative humidity
was above 80%. Coronavirus infections were significantly more common where daily 
average global radiation was under 300 kJ/m2/h (OR 4.3; CI 3.9-4.6; p < 0.001);
where average relative humidity was over 84% (OR 1.9; CI 3.9-4.6; p < 0.001);
where average air temperature was below 10 °C (OR 6.7; CI 6.1-7.3; p < 0.001) or 
where sunshine was below 4 h (OR 2.4; CI 2.2-2.6; p < 0.001) when compared to the
distribution of weather values for the same time period. Seasonal coronavirus
infections in children under 3 years old were more frequent at the start of an
annual epidemic than at the end, suggesting that the size of the susceptible
child population may be important in the annual cycle.
CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics of seasonal coronaviruses reflect immunological,
weather, social and travel drivers of infection. Evidence from studies on
different coronaviruses suggest that low temperature and low radiation/sunlight
favour survival. This implies a seasonal increase in SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the 
UK and countries with a similar climate as a result of an increase in the R0
associated with reduced temperatures and solar radiation. Increased measures to
reduce transmission will need to be introduced in winter months for COVID-19.
