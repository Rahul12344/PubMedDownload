SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is still a widespread threat to
society. The spike protein of this virus facilitates viral entry into the host
cell. Here, the denaturation of the S1 subunit of this spike protein by 2.45 GHz 
electromagnetic radiation was studied quantitatively. The study only pertains to 
the pure electromagnetic effects by eliminating the bulk heating effect of the
microwave radiation in an innovative setup that is capable of controlling the
temperature of the sample at any desired intensity of the electromagnetic field. 
This study was performed at the internal human body temperature, 37 °C, for a
relatively short amount of time under a high-power electromagnetic field. The
results showed that irradiating the protein with a 700 W, 2.45 GHz
electromagnetic field for 2 min can denature the protein to around 95%. In
comparison, this is comparable to thermal denaturation at 75 °C for 40 min.
Electromagnetic denaturation of the proteins of the virus may open doors to
potential therapeutic or sanitation applications.
