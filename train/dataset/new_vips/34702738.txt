Here, we expressed two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Abs) against severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; H4 and B38) in three
formats: IgG1, IgA1 monomers (m), and IgA1 dimers (d) in glycoengineered
Nicotiana benthamiana plants. All six Ab variants assembled properly and
exhibited a largely homogeneous glycosylation profile. Despite modest variation
in antigen binding between Ab formats, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (NT) potency
significantly increased in the following manner: IgG1 < IgA1-m < IgA1-d, with an 
up to 240-fold NT increase of dimers compared to corresponding monomers. Our
results underscore that both IgA's structural features and multivalency
positively impact NT potency. In addition, they emphasize the versatile use of
plants for the rapid expression of complex human proteins.
