BACKGROUND: Elevated D-dimer is known as predictor for severity of
SARS-CoV2-infection. Increased D-dimer is associated with thromboembolic
complications, but it is also a direct consequence of the acute lung injury seen 
in COVID-19 pneumonia.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the rate of persistent elevated D-dimer and its
association with thromboembolic complications and persistent ground glass
opacities (GGO) after recovery from COVID-19.
METHODS: In this post hoc analysis of a prospective multicenter trial, patients
underwent blood sampling, measurement of diffusion capacity, blood gas analysis, 
and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan following COVID-19. In case of 
increased D-dimer (>0,5 Î¼g/ml), an additional contrast medium-enhanced CT was
performed in absence of contraindications. Results were compared between patients
with persistent D-dimer elevation and patients with normal D-dimer level.
RESULTS: 129 patients (median age 48.8 years; range 19-91 years) underwent
D-Dimer assessment after a median (IQR) of 94 days (64-130) following COVID-19.
D-dimer elevation was found in 15% (19/129) and was significantly more common in 
patients who had experienced a severe SARS-CoV2 infection that had required
hospitalisation compared to patients with mild disease (p = 0.049).
Contrast-medium CT (n = 15) revealed an acute pulmonary embolism in one patient
and CTEPH in another patient. A significant lower mean pO2 (p = 0.015) and AaDO2 
(p = 0.043) were observed in patients with persistent D-Dimer elevation, but the 
rate of GGO were similar in both patient groups (p = 0.33).
CONCLUSION: In 15% of the patients recovered from COVID-19, persistent D-dimer
elevation was observed after a median of 3 months following COVID-19. These
patients had experienced a more severe COVID and still presented more frequently 
a lower mean pO2 and AaDO2.
