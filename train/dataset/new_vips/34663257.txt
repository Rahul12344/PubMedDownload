BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a major threat to public health. At
present, it is recommended that patients with known or suspected COVID-19 undergo
quarantine or medical observation for 14 days. However, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
positivity and prolonged viral shedding have been documented in convalescent
COVID-19 patients, complicating efforts to control viral spread and ensure
patient recovery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient who experienced two recurrent 
episodes of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and IgM positivity and viral shedding over 60 days
during hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrates that relapses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and
IgM positivity may occur even after COVID-19 symptoms have resolved, possibly as 
a consequence of prolonged viral shedding rather than re-infection.
