BACKGROUND: Intestinal neutrophil recruitment is a characteristic feature of the 
earliest stages of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Neutrophil elastase (NE) and
myeloperoxidase (MPO) mediate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs); NETs produce the bactericidal oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), causing
host tissue damage when unregulated. The project aim was to investigate the
relationship between NET formation and clinical IBD in humans.
METHODS: Human intestinal biopsies were collected from Crohn's disease (CD)
patients, endoscopically categorized as unaffected, transitional, or diseased,
and assigned a histopathological score.
RESULTS: A significant linear correlation was identified between pathological
score and cell viability (TUNEL+). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the
presence of NET markers NE, MPO, and citrullinated histone (CitH3) that increased
significantly with increasing histopathological score. Diseased specimens showed 
greater MPO+-immunostaining than control (P < .0001) and unaffected CD (P <
.0001), with transitional CD specimens also showing greater staining than
controls (P < .05) and unaffected CD (P < .05). Similarly, NE+-immunostaining was
elevated significantly in diseased CD than controls (P < .0001) and unaffected CD
(P < .0001) and was significantly higher in transitional CD than in controls (P <
.0001) and unaffected CD (P < .0001). The CitH3+-immunostaining of diseased CD
was significantly higher than controls (P < .05), unaffected CD (P < .0001) and
transitional CD (P < .05), with transitional CD specimens showing greater
staining than unaffected CD (P < .01). Multiplex immunohistochemistry with
z-stacking revealed colocalization of NE, MPO, CitH3, and DAPI (cell nuclei),
confirming the NET assignment.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate an association between increased NET formation
and CD severity, potentially due to excessive MPO-mediated HOCl production in the
extracellular domain, causing host tissue damage that exacerbates CD.

plain-language-summary: Our data show for the first time that the density of
neutrophil extracellular trap formed in the bowel of Crohn’s disease patients
increases with increasing disease severity, suggesting that
myeloperoxidase-mediated host-tissue damage may play a role in disease
pathogenesis.
