How Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
occasionally occurs following chronic inflammation remains to be elucidated. The 
case of a 57-year-old man who developed pulmonary EBV-positive DLBCL from
underlying silicosis lesions is presented. Immunohistochemical examination of the
resected silicosis lesions showed predominant helper T cells and M1/M2
macrophages, with a lack of B cells, regulatory T cells, and resident memory T
cells. Two years later, EBV-positive DLBCL emerged unexpectedly from the
silicosis. The imbalance of the immune cells in the microenvironment, at least in
part, may help explain how chronic inflammation contributes to EBV-positive
DLBCL.
