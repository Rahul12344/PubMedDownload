This study investigates empirically how air pollution in earlier periods as
measured by three air pollutants, namely N O 2, P M 10, and P M 2.5 may have
affected the spread and fatality of COVID-19 in 31 European countries. Using
panel data with fixed effects to examine the relationship between previous
exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 new cases and COVID-19 deaths, we find
that previous air pollution levels have both acted as an important factor in
explaining the COVID-19 spread and its high fatality rate. This result may
explain the negative impact that these pollutants may have on health and in
particular on the respiratory functions that are mainly attacked by the
virus.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary
