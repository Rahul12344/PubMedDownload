SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged and highly pathogenic coronavirus, is identified as
the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) in the late December
2019, in China. The virus has rapidly spread nationwide and spilled over to the
other countries around the globe, resulting in more than 120 million infections
and 2.6 million deaths until the time of this review. Unfortunately, there are
still no specific drugs available against this disease, and it is very necessary 
to call upon more scientists to work together to stop a further spread. Hence,
the recent progress in the development of drugs may help scientific community
quickly understand current research status and further develop new effective
drugs. Herein, we summarize the cellular entry and replication process of this
virus and discuss the recent development of potential viral based drugs that
target bio-macromolecules in different stages of the viral life cycle, especially
S protein, 3CLPro, PLPro, RdRp and helicase.
