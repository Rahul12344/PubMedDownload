Various categories of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients have exhibited
major mortality rate differences and symptoms. Some papers have recently
explained these differences in mortality rates and symptoms as a consequence of
this virus infection acting in synergy with one or more latent pathogen
infections in some patients. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved in
millions of these patients is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which
infects approximately one third of the global human population. However, other
papers have concluded that latent protozoan parasite infections can reduce the
severity of viral infections. The aims and purposes of this paper include
providing explanations for the contradictions between these studies and
introducing a significant new category of T-cell exhaustion. Latent pathogens can
have different genetic strains with great differences in their effects on a
second pathogen infection. Furthermore, depending on the timing and effectiveness
of drug treatments, pathogen infections that become latent may or may not later
induce immune cell dysfunctions, including T-cell exhaustion. Concurrent multiple
pathogen T-cell exhaustion is herein called "polyspecific T-cell exhaustion."
