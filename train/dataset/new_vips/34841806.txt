Different fragments of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were expressed and
purified, and a fluorescence immunochromatography method for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 total antibody was established. The effect of different protein
fragments on the performance of the method was evaluated. The N protein sequence 
was analyzed by bioinformatics technology, expressed in prokaryotic cell and
purified by metal ion affinity chromatography column. Different N protein
fragments were prepared for comparison. EDC reaction was used to label
fluorescence microsphere on the synthesized antigen to construct sandwich
fluorescence chromatography antibody detection assay, and the performance was
systemically evaluated. Among the 4 prepared N protein fragments, the full-length
N protein (N419) was selected as the optimized coating antigen, N412 with 0.5
mol/L NaCl was used as the optimal combination; deleting 91-120 amino acids from 
the N-terminal of N412 reduced non-specific signal by 87.5%. the linear range of 
detection was 0.312-80 U/L, the limit of detection was 0.165 U/L, and the
accuracy was more than 95%. A fluorescence immunochromatographic detection method
for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody was established by pairing N protein
fragments. The detection result achieved 98% concordance with the commercially
available Guangzhou Wanfu test strip, which is expected to be used as a
supplementary approach for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay could also provide 
experimental reference for improving the performance of COVID-19 antibody
detection reagents.
