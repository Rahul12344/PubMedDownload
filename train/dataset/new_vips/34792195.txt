The purpose of this online empirical study was to examine the relationship
between COVID-19 stress, coping including substance use and behavioural
disengagement, and avoidance behaviour early on in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Participants, recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk, N = 730), were
adults from Canada, the United States, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Results of path analysis showed that feeling threatened by the virus, predicted
greater COVID-19 anxiety, which was related to greater substance use to cope with
the virus, as well as more behavioural disengagement, which predicted less
avoidance behaviour. Implications of the results are discussed, particularly the 
relationship between coping and avoidance behaviour during the pandemic.
