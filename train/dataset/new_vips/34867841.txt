The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded due to the widespread
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission
reinforced the urgent need for affordable molecular diagnostic alternative
methods for massive testing screening. We present the clinical validation of a
pH-dependent colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The method revealed a limit of 
detection of 19.3 ± 2.7 viral genomic copies/μL when using RNA extracted samples 
obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in guanidine-containing viral
transport medium. Typical RT-LAMP reactions were performed at 65°C for 30 min.
When compared to reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR), up to cycle-threshold (Ct) value 32, RT-LAMP presented 98% [95%
confidence interval (CI) = 95.3-99.5%] sensitivity and 100% (95% CI = 94.5-100%) 
specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection targeting E and N genes. No
cross-reactivity was detected when testing other non-SARS-CoV virus, confirming
high specificity. The test is compatible with primary RNA extraction-free
samples. We also demonstrated that colorimetric RT-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2
variants of concern and variants of interest, such as variants occurring in
Brazil named gamma (P.1), zeta (P.2), delta (B.1.617.2), B.1.1.374, and
B.1.1.371. The method meets point-of-care requirements and can be deployed in the
field for high-throughput COVID-19 testing campaigns, especially in countries
where COVID-19 testing efforts are far from ideal to tackle the pandemics.
Although RT-qPCR is considered the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, it
requires expensive equipment, infrastructure, and highly trained personnel. In
contrast, RT-LAMP emerges as an affordable, inexpensive, and simple alternative
for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection that can be applied to massive COVID-19
testing campaigns and save lives.
