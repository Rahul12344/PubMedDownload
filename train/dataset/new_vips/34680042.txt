Green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore and its congeners draw significant
attention mostly for bioimaging purposes. In this work we probed these compounds 
as antiviral agents. We have chosen LTR-III DNA G4, the major G-quadruplex (G4)
present in the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter region of the human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), as the target for primary screening and
designing antiviral drug candidates. The stabilization of this G4 was previously 
shown to suppress viral gene expression and replication. FRET-based
high-throughput screening (HTS) of 449 GFP chromophore-like compounds revealed a 
number of hits, sharing some general structural features. Structure-activity
relationships (SAR) for the most effective stabilizers allowed us to establish
structural fragments, important for G4 binding. Synthetic compounds, developed on
the basis of SAR analysis, exhibited high LTR-III G4 stabilization level. NMR
spectroscopy and molecular modeling revealed the possible formation of LTR-III
G4-ligand complex with one of the lead selective derivative ZS260.1 positioned
within the cavity, thus supporting the LTR-III G4 attractiveness for drug
targeting. Selected compounds showed moderate activity against HIV-I (EC50
1.78-7.7 Î¼M) in vitro, but the activity was accompanied by pronounced
cytotoxicity.
