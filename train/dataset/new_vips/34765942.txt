Herpes simplex infection is the most common infection among the human
immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. However, the atypical manifestations
of herpes simplex virus may confound even an astute physician. Hand involvement
is rarely associated with genital herpes infection and the involvement of
widespread areas healing with debilitating scarring is uncommon.
