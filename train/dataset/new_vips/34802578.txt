Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic in parts of the world such as southern China 
and Southeast Asia. It is predominantly an undifferentiated carcinoma with a
strong genetic basis and a close association with the Epstein-Barr virus. The
ability of MR imaging to depict the boundaries of the primary tumor and its
relationship with the complex structures of the skull base makes it the technique
of choice for imaging of this disease in the head and neck. This article
describes the MR imaging findings pertinent to staging and management and a new
role of MR imaging in early cancer detection, in addition to a brief discussion
of differential diagnoses.
