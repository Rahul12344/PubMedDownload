BACKGROUND Since Emergency Use Authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in December
2020, more is becoming known about their adverse effects. Growing numbers of
myopericarditis cases after COVID-19 vaccination are being reported, mostly in
younger adults. While most of these patients have recovered rapidly and without
complications, it is still unclear whether patients who are older and have
greater cardiac dysfunction secondary to myopericarditis will also experience the
same recovery. CASE REPORT We report the case of a middle-aged man with
myopericarditis and significant left ventricular dysfunction after the second
dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. He presented several days 
after vaccination, and with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment, he quickly
recovered ventricular function, and symptoms resolved within 1 week after
vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccines are a key tool in combating the COVID-19
pandemic, yet many people are hesitant to seek vaccination, perhaps for fear of
adverse events. Our report of a middle-aged patient with significant left
ventricular dysfunction, who still experienced rapid recovery, should reassure
the public about the safety of vaccines. Such rare adverse effects should not
deter people from receiving COVID-19 vaccination.
