BACKGROUND It is unclear whether solid organ transplant (SOT) patients have more 
severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and worse outcome than the general
population. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a case-control study on 32 SOT
recipients and 84 non-SOT controls matched for age and sex admitted for confirmed
COVID-19. The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality rate.
Secondary endpoints included severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
use of high-flow oxygen therapy, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The median 
(IQR) Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) at admission was significantly higher in
SOT recipients (6 (3-8) vs 3 (2-4); P<0.01). Fever was less frequent in SOT
recipients (78% vs 94%, P=0.01). SOT recipients had a higher median SaO2/FiO2 at 
admission (452 [443-462] vs 443 [419-452], P<0.01) and reached the worst
SaO2/FiO2 value later during hospitalization 15 (10-21) vs 11 (9-14) days,
P=0.01). Both groups had a similar severe ARDS rate during hospitalization (33%
vs 28%) (p=0.59). There were no significant differences during hospitalization in
terms of highest level of respiratory support needed, or length of hospital stay:
8.5 (5.5-21) vs 11.5 (6.5-16.5) days; P=0.34) in SOT recipients when compared to 
controls. In-hospital all-cause mortality rates were significantly higher in SOT 
recipients (21.9% vs 4.7%, P<0.01; OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.10-10.98), but among
patients who died, median CCI was similar between groups (8 [6-8] vs 7 [6-8]).
CONCLUSIONS In our experience, hospitalized SOT recipients for COVID-19 had
higher in-hospital mortality compared to non-SOT patients, probably due to the
greater number of underlying comorbidities, and not directly related to chronic
immunosuppression.
