Viral infections pose a severe threat to humans by causing many infectious, even 
fatal, diseases, such as the current pandemic disease (COVID-19) since 2019, and 
understanding how the host innate immune system recognizes viruses has become
more important. Endosomal and cytosolic sensors can detect viral nucleic acids to
induce type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, subsequently inducing
interferon-stimulated genes for restricting viral infection. Although viral RNA
and DNA sensing generally rely on diverse receptors and adaptors, the crosstalk
between DNA and RNA sensing is gradually appreciated. This minireview highlights 
the overlap between the RNA- and DNA-sensing mechanisms in antiviral innate
immunity, which significantly amplifies the antiviral innate responses to
restrict viral infection and might be a potential novel target for preventing and
treating viral diseases.
