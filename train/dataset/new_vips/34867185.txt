The homeostatic balance of the brain and retina is maintained by the presence of 
the blood-brain and inner blood-retinal barrier (BBB/iBRB, respectively) which
are highly specialized barriers. Endothelial cells forming the lining of these
blood vessels are interconnected by the presence of tight junctions which form
the BBB and iBRB. These tight junctions, formed of numerous interacting proteins,
enable the entry of molecules into neural tissues while restricting the entry of 
harmful material such as anaphylatoxins, bacteria and viruses. If the tight
junction complex becomes dysregulated due to changes in expression levels of one 
or more of the components, this can have detrimental effects leading to brain and
retinal pathology.
