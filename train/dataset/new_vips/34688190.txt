PURPOSE: We describe the spectrum of acute neurological disorders among
hospitalized patients who recently had COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.
METHOD: We performed a prospective study at 7 acute hospitals in Singapore.
Hospitalized patients who were referred for neurological complaints and had
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, in the last 6 weeks were
classified into central nervous system (CNS) syndromes, cerebrovascular
disorders, peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders, autonomic nervous system
(ANS) disorders and immunization stress-related responses (ISRR).
RESULTS: From 30 December 2020 to 20 April 2021, 1,398,074 persons (median age
59 years, 54.5% males) received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (86.7% BNT162b2, 13.3%
mRNA-1273); 915,344(65.5%) completed 2 doses. Four hundred and fifty-seven(0.03%)
patients were referred for neurological complaints [median age 67(20-97) years,
281(61.5%) males; 95.8% received BNT162b2 and 4.2% mRNA-1273], classified into
73(16.0%) CNS syndromes, 286(62.6%) cerebrovascular disorders, 59(12.9%) PNS
disorders, 0 ANS disorders and 39(8.5%) ISRRs. Eleven of 27 patients with cranial
mononeuropathy had Bell's palsy. Of 33 patients with seizures, only 4 were
unprovoked and occurred within 2 weeks of vaccination. All strokes occurred among
individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. We recorded 2 cases of
cerebral venous thrombosis; none were vaccine-induced thrombotic
thrombocytopenia. Five had mild flares of immune-mediated diseases.
CONCLUSION: Our observational study does not establish causality of the described
disorders to vaccines. Though limited by the lack of baseline incidence data of
several conditions, we observed no obvious signal of serious neurological
morbidity associated with mRNA vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination 
outweigh concerns over neurological adverse events.
