Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a coinhibitory receptor
that plays an essential role in maintaining immune system homeostasis by
suppressing T-cell activation. We report a sporadic case of CTLA4
haploinsufficiency in a patient with Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and subsequent benign lymphadenopathy. A missense mutation in
exon 2 of the CTLA4 gene (c.251T>C, p.V84A) was found in the patient's peripheral
blood and buccal cell DNA, but not in her parents' DNA. CTLA4 expression
decreased in the peripheral regulatory T cells upon stimulation, whereas CTLA4
and PD-1-positive T cell subsets increased, possibly to compensate for the
defective CTLA4 function. This case suggests that some adult lymphoma patients
with no remarkable medical history have primary immune disorder. As
immune-targeted therapies are now widely used for the treatment of malignancies, 
it is increasingly important to recognize the underlying primary immune disorders
to properly manage the disease and avoid unexpected complications of
immunotherapies.
