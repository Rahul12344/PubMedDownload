COVID-19 is a viral infection characterized by a cytokine storm similar to that
in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophils and monocytes are
known to play an important role in tissue damage in ARDS. COVID-19 has been
reported to be more severe in patients with hematological malignancies; however, 
there are few reports of COVID-19 in patients with aplastic anemia. Moreover, how
aplastic anemia affects COVID-19 remains unclear. Here, we report the case of a
COVID-19 patient with aplastic anemia who had high serum IL-6 levels but did not 
progress to the severe form of COVID-19. We inferred that severe neutropenia and 
monocytopenia due to aplastic anemia could contribute to a mild form of COVID-19,
although a risk of more severe secondary bacterial infections exists.
