Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a class 
of fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by the entry and spread of infectious 
prion proteins (PrPSc) in the central nervous system (CNS). These diseases are
endemic to certain mammalian animal species that use their sense of smell for a
variety of purposes and therefore expose their nasal cavity (NC) to PrPSc in the 
environment. Prion diseases that affect humans are either inherited due to a
mutation of the gene that encodes the prion protein, acquired by exposure to
contaminated tissues or medical devices, or develop without a known cause
(referred to as sporadic). The purpose of this review is to identify components
of the NC that are involved in prion transport and to summarize the evidence that
the NC serves as a route of entry (centripetal spread) and/or a source of
shedding (centrifugal spread) of PrPSc, and thus plays a role in the pathogenesis
of the TSEs.
