Reactivation of overt or occult HBV infection (HBVr) is a well-known, potentially
life-threatening event which can occur during the course of immunosuppressive
treatments. Although it has been described mainly in subjects receiving therapy
for oncological or hematological diseases, the increasing use of
immunosuppressant agents in non-oncological patients observed in recent years has
raised concerns about the risk of reactivation in several other settings.
However, few data can be found in the literature on the occurrence of HBVr in
these populations, and few clear recommendations on its management have been
defined. The present paper was written to provide an overview of the risk of HBV 
reactivation in non-neoplastic patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs,
particularly for rheumatological, gastrointestinal, dermatological and
neurological diseases, and for COVID-19 patients receiving immunomodulating
agents; and to discuss the potential strategies for prevention and treatment of
HBVr in these settings.
