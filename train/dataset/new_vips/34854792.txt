More than 600,000 incarcerated individuals are released annually in the United
States; a large proportion are Black men incarcerated for drug-related offenses, 
including drug use and possession. Formerly incarcerated Black men report
elevated rates of condomless sex and sexually transmitted infections, including
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The purpose of this study was to explore
condom usage among Black men who were formerly incarcerated for drug-related
offenses and living in New York City (NYC). Using a semi-structured interview
guide, in-depth interviews were conducted with 26 formerly incarcerated Black
men. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo, then
manually coded utilizing thematic analysis methods. The following four themes
were identified: partner type and length of the relationship affected condom use;
diminished pleasure was a barrier for condom use; challenges with ill-fitting and
poor-quality condoms; and the withdrawal method was used as an HIV prevention
technique. Our findings suggest that formerly incarcerated Black men are engaging
in condomless sex post-incarceration. Greater exposure to prevention messages and
targeted interventions with content that includes interpersonal and condom use
skill-building, methods to increase pleasurable condom use, information on HIV
and STI transmission modes, and access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be 
beneficial for this population.
