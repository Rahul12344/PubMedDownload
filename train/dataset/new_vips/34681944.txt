A viral infection involves entry and replication of viral nucleic acid in a host 
organism, subsequently leading to biochemical and structural alterations in the
host cell. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, over-activation of the host
immune system may lead to lung damage. Albeit the regeneration and fibrotic
repair processes being the two protective host responses, prolonged injury may
lead to excessive fibrosis, a pathological state that can result in lung
collapse. In this review, we discuss regeneration and fibrosis processes in
response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide our viewpoint on the triggering of alveolar
regeneration in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
