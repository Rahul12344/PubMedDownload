After primary infection, varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes prolonged latent
infections that may reactivate, depending on the immunologic status of the host. 
We present a case of VZV reactivation in a 10-year-old male patient that
underwent unrelated peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (uPBSCT) for
T-lymphoblastic lymphoma with lymphoma cutis lesions. This patient had a history 
of herpes zoster involving the right L2-5 dermatome and trigeminal V1 dermatome
prior to uPBSCT. Three months post-uPBSCT, the patient's underlying disease
relapsed, and the patient presented with lymphoma cutis lesions. A few days after
a skin biopsy was performed to pathologically confirm skin relapse, vesicles
appeared only involving the skin areas with lymphoma cutis. This case illustrates
how decreased areas of epidermal immune mechanisms may cause atypical
presentations of varicella infection.
