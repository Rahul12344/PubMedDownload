BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) represents an important pathogenic factor of
lymphoma and is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an essential role in
lymphoma progression. However, the underlying mechanism of circRNA on DLBCL
progression related to EBV remains largely unknown.
METHODS: CircRNA was screened by high-throughput sequencing in tumor samples of
12 patients with DLBCL according to EBV infection status. Expression of circEAF2,
as well as the relationship with clinical characteristics and prognosis, were
further analyzed in tumor samples of 100 DLBCL patients using quantitative
real-time PCR. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to
investigate the biological functions of circEAF2 both in vitro and in vivo. The
underlying mechanism of circRNA on DLBCL progression were further determined by
RNA sequencing, RNA pull down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, rescue
experiments and western blotting.
RESULTS: We identified a novel circRNA circEAF2, which was downregulated in
EBV + DLBCL and negatively correlated with EBV infection and DLBCL progression.
In EBV-positive B lymphoma cells, circEAF2 overexpression induced lymphoma cell
apoptosis and sensitized lymphoma cells to epirubicin. As mechanism of action,
circEAF2 specifically targeted EBV-encoded miR-BART19-3p, upregulated APC, and
suppressed downstream β-catenin expression, resulting in inactivation of Wnt
signaling pathway and inhibition of EBV + DLBCL cell proliferation. In
EBV-positive B-lymphoma murine models, xenografted tumors with circEAF2
overexpression presented decreased Ki-67 positivity, increased cell apoptosis and
retarded tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: CircEAF2 counteracted EBV + DLBCL progression via
miR-BART19-3p/APC/β-catenin axis, referring circEAF2 as a potential prognostic
biomarker. Therapeutic targeting EBV-encoded miRNA may be a promising strategy in
treating EBV-associated lymphoid malignancies.
