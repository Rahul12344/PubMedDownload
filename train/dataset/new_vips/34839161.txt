Hierarchical virtual screening combined with ADME prediction and cluster analysis
methods were used to identify influenza virus PB2 inhibitors with high activity, 
good druggability properties, and diverse structures. The 200,000 molecules in
the ChemDiv core library were narrowed down to a final set of 97 molecules, of
which six compounds were found to rescue cells from both H1N1 and H3N2
virus-induced CPE with EC50 values ranging from 5.81 μM to 42.77 μM, and could
bind to the PB2 CBD of H1N1, with Kd values of 0.11 μM to 6.4 μM. The six
compounds have novel structures and low molecular weight and are, thus, suitable 
serve as lead compounds for development as PB2 inhibitors. A receptor-based
pharmacophore model was successfully constructed using key amino acid residues
for the binding of inhibitors to PB2, provided by the MD simulations. This
pharmacophore model suggested that to improve the activity of our active
compounds, we should mainly focus on optimizing their existing structures with
the aim of increasing their adaptability to the binding site, rather than adding 
chemical fragments to increase their binding to adjacent sites. This
pharmacophore construction method facilitates the creation of a reasonable
pharmacophore model without the need to fully understand the structure-activity
relationships, and our descriptions provide a useful reference for similar
research.
