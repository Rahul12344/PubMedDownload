INTRODUCTION: In 2020. the COVID-19 pandemic presented an additional source of
stress and anxiety not just to the general population but also to medical
students who are, even under normal circumstances, constantly under pressure due 
to demanding student duties. In addition, they experienced a series of
devastating earthquakes in and around the Zagreb region which altogether could
have had compromised their psychological well-being. The aim of this review was
to evaluate the psychological effects of these two natural disasters on the
mental health of Croatian medical students.
RESULTS: According to standardized questionnaires for depression and anxiety
evaluation, 75.3% of students were anxious and 65.2% were depressive during the
"double crisis". No significant difference of these two outcomes was observed
regarding genders, but it was found that first year students had a significantly 
higher anxiety score than older ones.
CONCLUSION: In such stressful situations, we should emphasize the importance of
mental health not just of healthcare workers, but also of medical students in
order to prevent serious psychological consequences and to alleviate the negative
effects on students' motivation and their educational process.
