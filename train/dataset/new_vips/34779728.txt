BACKGROUND: The current pandemic has reduced access to safe, monitored physical
activity (PA) programs for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). The use of
telerehabilitation has the potential for continuing activity engagement without
risking virus exposure. The present study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy 
of an online group-based PA program for persons with SCI.
METHODS: This preliminary pre-post study delivered an online group-based PA
program to persons with SCI. The program consisted of 1-hour sessions twice
weekly for six weeks. Online PA satisfaction questionnaires were assessed at
post-treatment. Psychosocial subscales from the NeuroQOL-SF were assessed.
RESULTS: Participants were adult females between 3 and 32 years post-injury, 1
tetraplegic and 3 paraplegics (n = 4). All participants were highly satisfied
with the online instruction, overall content, and videoconferencing platform.
Participants stated that the online program was beneficial for their overall
physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The program resulted in improvement in
anxiety and satisfaction with social roles and activities.
CONCLUSION: The current pilot study demonstrates the acceptability and limited
efficacy of an online PA program for those with SCI. The program resulted in
improved overall perceived wellbeing and satisfaction with social roles and
activities. These results have important implications for the clinical
implementation of online PA programs in a hospital and community setting.
