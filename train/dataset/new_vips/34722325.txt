Introduction: Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and moderate
COVID-19 may be the most common COVID-19 cases. This study was designed to
develop a diagnostic model for patients with asymptomatic and moderate COVID-19
based on demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables.
Methods: This retrospective study divided the subjects into 2 groups:
asymptomatic COVID-19 (without symptoms, n = 15) and moderate COVID-19 (with
symptoms, n = 57). Demographic characteristics, clinical data, routine blood
tests, other laboratory tests, and inpatient data were collected and analyzed to 
compare patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 and moderate COVID-19.
Results: Comparison of the asymptomatic COVID-19 group with the moderate COVID-19
group yielded the following results: the patients were younger (P = 0.045); the
cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ (cytotoxic) T cell level was higher (P =
0.017); the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was lower (P = 0.001); the white blood
cell (WBC, P < 0.001), neutrophil (NEU, P = 0.036), lymphocyte (LYM, P = 0.009), 
and eosinophil (EOS, P = 0.036) counts were higher; and the serum iron level (P =
0.049) was higher in the asymptomatic COVID-19 group. The multivariate analysis
showed that the NEU count (odds ratio [OR] = 2.007, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.162 - 3.715, P = 0.014) and LYM count (OR = 9.380, 95% CI: 2.382 - 36.934, P = 
0.001) were independent factors for the presence of clinical symptoms after
COVID-19 infection. The NEU count and LYM count were diagnostic predictors of
asymptomatic COVID-19. This diagnostic prediction model showed high
discriminatory power, consistency, and net clinical benefits.
Conclusions: The proposed model can distinguish asymptomatic COVID-19 from
moderate COVID-19, thereby helping clinicians identify and distinguish patients
with potential asymptomatic COVID-19 from those with moderate COVID-19.
