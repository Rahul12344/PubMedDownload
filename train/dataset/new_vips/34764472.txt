Systemic inflammation elicited by sepsis can induce an acute cerebral dysfunction
known as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Recent evidence suggests that
SAE is common but shows a dynamic trajectory over time. Half of all patients with
sepsis develop SAE in the intensive care unit, and some survivors present with
sustained cognitive impairments for several years after initial sepsis onset. It 
is not clear why some, but not all, patients develop SAE and also the factors
that determine the persistence of SAE. Here, we first summarize the chronic
pathology and the dynamic changes in cognitive functions seen after the onset of 
sepsis. We then outline the cerebral effects of sepsis, such as
neuroinflammation, alterations in neuronal synapses and neurovascular changes. We
discuss the key factors that might contribute to the development and persistence 
of SAE in older patients, including premorbid neurodegenerative pathology, side
effects of sedatives, renal dysfunction and latent virus reactivation. Finally,
we postulate that some of the mechanisms that underpin neuropathology in SAE may 
also be relevant to delirium and persisting cognitive impairments that are seen
in patients with severe COVID-19.
