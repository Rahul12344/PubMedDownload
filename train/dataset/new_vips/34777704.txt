The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered an international pandemic that 
has led to significant public health problems. To date, limited evidence exists
to suggest that drugs are effective against the disease. As possible treatments
are being investigated, herbal medicines have shown potential for producing novel
antiviral agents for the COVID-19 disease.Aim: This review explored the potential
of Malawi's traditional medicinal plants for the management of COVID-19.
Methods: The authors searched on PubMed and Google scholar for medicinal plants
that are used in Malawi and published in openly available peer reviewed journals.
Plants linked with antiviral treatment, anti-COVID-19 activity or COVID-19
symptoms management were targeted. These included activity against pneumonia,
inflammation, cough, difficulty in breathing, pain/aches, fever, diarrhoea,
rheumatism, fatigue, asthma, immunocompromised and cardiovascular diseases.
Results: 11 studies were found with 306 plant species. 127 plant species had at
least one COVID-19 related pharmacological activity. Of these plant species, the 
number of herbal entities used for each indication was: pain/aches (87), fever
(2), pneumonia (9), breathing/asthma problems (5), coughing (11), diarrhoea (1), 
immunosuppression (8), blood issues (10), fatigue (2), heart problems (11),
inflammation (8), rheumatism (10) and viral diseases (12). Thirty (30) species
were used for more than one disease and Azedarachta indica topped the list (6 of 
the 13 COVID-19 related diseases). The majority of the species had phytochemicals
known to have antiviral activity or mechanisms of actions linked to COVID-19 and 
consequent diseases' treatment pathways.
Conclusion: Medicinal plants are a promising source of compounds that can be used
for drug development of COVID-19 related diseases. This review highlights
potential targets for the World Health Organization and other research entities
to explore in order to assist in controlling the pandemic.
