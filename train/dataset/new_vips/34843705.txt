BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Long-term kinetics of anti-RBD IgG and neutralizing
antibodies were analyzed in a cohort of COVID-19 naïve health care workers (HCW) 
undergoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
METHODS: An anti-RBD IgG immunoassay and a surrogate virus neutralization test
(sVNT) were performed at different time points up to 6 months after vaccination
in 57 HCWs. Values of anti-RBD IgG predicting an high neutralizing bioactivity
(>60%) were also calculated.
RESULTS: Mean (range) values of anti-RBD IgG were 294.7 (11.6-1554), 2583
(398-8391), 320.4 (42.3-1134) BAU/mL at T1 (21 days after the 1st dose [T0]), T2 
(30 days after the 2nd dose) and T3 (+180 days after T0), respectively. Mean
(range) percentages of neutralization (NS%) were 24 (0-76), 86 (59-96) and 82
(52-99) at T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Anti-RBD IgG values and NS% were
positively correlated at T2 and T3 while anti-RBD IgG value predicting a NS% > 60
markedly differed at T2 and T3 (594 vs. 108 BAU/mL, respectively).
CONCLUSION: While a high neutralizing bioactivity was maintained at least
6 months after vaccination in almost all individuals, the mean values of
anti-RBD-IgG showed a marked decline at 6 months. The absolute value of anti-RBD 
IgG is a poor marker of neutralizing bioactivity.
