BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic
has underscored the need for additional data, tools, and methods that can be used
to combat emerging and existing public health concerns. Since March 2020, there
has been great interest in utilizing social media data to both understand and
intervene in the pandemic. Researchers from many disciplines have recently found 
a relationship between COVID-19 and a new data set from Facebook called the
Social Connectedness Index (SCI).
OBJECTIVE: Building off this work, we sought to use the SCI to examine how social
similarity of Missouri counties could explain similarities of COVID-19 cases over
time. Additionally, we aimed to add to the body of literature on the utility of
the SCI by using a novel modeling technique.
METHODS: In September 2020 we conducted this cross-sectional study using publicly
available data to test the association between the SCI and COVID-19 spread in
Missouri using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). ERGMs model relational
data and the outcome variable must be binary; representing the presence or
absence of a relationship. In our model, this was the presence or absence of a
highly correlated COVID-19 case count trajectory between two given counties in
Missouri. Covariates included each county's total population, percent rurality,
and distance between each county pair.
RESULTS: We found that all covariates were significantly associated with two
counties having highly correlated COVID-19 case count trajectories. As the log of
a county's total population increased, the odds of two counties has having highly
correlated COVID-19 case count trajectories increased by 66% (OR 1.66, 95% CI
1.43-1.92). As the percent of a county classified as rural increased, the odds of
two counties has having highly correlated COVID-19 case count trajectories
increased by 1% (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01). As the distance (in miles) between
two counties increased, the odds of two counties has having highly correlated
COVID-19 case count trajectories decreased by 43% (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.77).
Lastly, as the log of the Social Connectedness Index increased between two
Missouri counties increases, the odds of those two counties having highly
correlated COVID-19 case count trajectories significantly increased by 17% (OR
1.17; 95% CI 1.09-1.26).
CONCLUSIONS: These results could suggest that two counties with a greater
likelihood of sharing Facebook friendships means residents of those counties have
a higher likelihood of sharing similar belief systems, in particular as they
relate to COVID-19 and public health practices. Another possibility is that the
SCI is picking up travel or movement data among county residents. This suggests
the SCI is capturing a unique phenomenon relevant to COVID-19 and that it may be 
worth adding to other COVID-19 models. Additional research is needed to better
understand what the SCI is capturing practically and what it means for public
health policies and prevention practices.
