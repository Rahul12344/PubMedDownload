BACKGROUND: Closed fitness centers during the Covid-19 pandemic may negatively
impact health and wellbeing. We assessed whether training at fitness centers
increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
METHODS: In a two-group parallel randomized controlled trial, fitness center
members aged 18 to 64 without Covid-19-relevant comorbidities, were randomized to
access to training at a fitness center or no-access. Fitness centers applied
physical distancing (1 m for floor exercise, 2 m for high-intensity classes) and 
enhanced hand and surface hygiene. Primary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 RNA status by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after 14 days, hospital admission after 21 days. 
The secondary endpoint was SARS-CoV-2 antibody status after 1 month.
RESULTS: 3764 individuals were randomized; 1896 to the training arm and 1868 to
the no-training arm. In the training arm, 81.8% trained at least once, and 38.5% 
trained ≥six times. Of 3016 individuals who returned the SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests
(80.5%), there was one positive test in the training arm, and none in the
no-training arm (risk difference 0.053%; 95% CI - 0.050 to 0.156%; p = 0.32).
Eleven individuals in the training arm (0.8% of tested) and 27 in the no-training
arm (2.4% of tested) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (risk
difference - 0.87%; 95%CI - 1.52% to - 0.23%; p = 0.001). No outpatient visits or
hospital admissions due to Covid-19 occurred in either arm.
CONCLUSION: Provided good hygiene and physical distancing measures and low
population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was no increased infection
risk of SARS-CoV-2 in fitness centers in Oslo, Norway for individuals without
Covid-19-relevant comorbidities.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov 
on May 13, 2020. Due to administrative issues it was first posted on the register
website on May 29, 2020: NCT04406909 .
