African swine fever is a severe animal infectious disease caused by African swine
fever virus (ASFV), and the morbidity and mortality associated with virulent ASFV
isolates are as high as 100%. Previous studies showed that the ability of ASFV to
antagonize IFN production is closely related to its pathogenicity. Here, we
report that ASFV HLJ/18 infection induced low levels of type I IFN and inhibited 
cGMP-AMP-induced type I IFN production in porcine alveolar macrophages that were 
isolated from specific pathogen-free Landrace piglets. Subsequently, an unbiased 
screen was performed to screen the ASFV genes with inhibitory effects on the type
I IFN production. ASFV pI215L, a viral E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, was
identified as one of the strongest inhibitory effectors on the production of type
I IFN. Knockdown of pI215L expression inhibited ASFV replication and enhanced
IFN-β production. However, inhibition of type I IFN production by pI215L was
independent of its E2 enzyme activity. Furthermore, we found that pI215L
inhibited type I IFN production and K63-linked polyubiquitination of TANK-binding
kinase 1 through pI215L-binding RING finger protein 138 (RNF138). ASFV pI215L
enhanced the interaction between RNF138 and RNF128 and promoted RNF138 to degrade
RNF128, which resulted in reduced K63-linked polyubiquitination of TANK-binding
kinase 1 and type І IFN production. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel
immune escape mechanism of ASFV, which provides a clue to the design and
development of an immune-sensitive attenuated live vaccine.
