Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited heart disease with a
prevalence of about 0.2%. HCM is typically caused by mutations in genes encoding 
sarcomere or sarcomere-associated proteins. Here, we characterized induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated from the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of three HCM patients each carrying c.433C > T, c.610C > T, or 
c.235C > T mutation in the TNNI3 gene by non-integrated Sendai virus. All of the 
three lines exhibited normal morphology, expression of pluripotent markers,
stable karyotype, and the potential of trilineage differentiation. The
cardiomyocytes differentiated from these iPSC lines can serve as useful tools to 
model HCM in vitro.
