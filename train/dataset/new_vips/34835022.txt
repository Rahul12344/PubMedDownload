Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the serious health problems in the
world as HBV causes severe liver diseases. Moreover, HBV reactivation has
occasionally been observed in patients with resolved HBV infection and patients
using immunosuppression and anticancer drugs. Large-scale hospital data focused
on HBV infection and severe liver function were analyzed at our hospital, located
in an urban area adjacent to Tokyo, the capital city of Japan. A total of 99,932 
individuals whose blood samples were taken at 7,170,240 opportunities were
analyzed. The HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive group had a more frequent
prevalence of patients with higher transaminase elevations than the
HBsAg-negative group. However, among the HBsAg-negative group, patients who were 
positive for anti-HBV surface antibody and/or anti-HBV core antibody, had more
severe liver conditions and fatal outcomes. More careful attention should be paid
to alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations higher than 1000 IU/L in patients who
had current and previous HBV infection.
