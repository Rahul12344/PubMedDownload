Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is recognized as the main cause of neonatal
death, and efficient treatment strategies remain limited. This study aims to
investigate the mechanism of sevoflurane (SF) post-treatment in alleviating HIE
in rats. The HIE rat model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model were
established, and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 
EHMT2 (G9a) was transfected after SF treatment. The learning and memory ability
and the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) were evaluated and determined. The levels of G9a/histone H3 lysine 9
dimethylation (H3K9me2) and the enrichment level of H3K9me2 in the promoter
region of BDNF gene were analyzed. After SF post-treatment, the neurons in
cerebral cortex, the learning and memory skills and the contents of NGF/BDNF were
increased, while the apoptosis and G9a/H3K9me2 levels were reduced. After
overexpression of G9a in vitro/vivo, the enrichment levels of H3K9me2 in the
promoter region of BDNF were increased, the levels of BDNF were decreased, the
neurons were damaged and the learning and memory abilities of HIE rats were
impaired. The conclusion is that SF post-treatment can promote the expression of 
BDNF by inhibiting H3K9me2 on the BDNF gene promoter and inhibiting G9a, thus
alleviating HIE in rats.
