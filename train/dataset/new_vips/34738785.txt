Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has become an important tool during the
COVID-19 pandemic, however the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater 
treatment plant influent (WWTP) and cases in the community is not well-defined.
We report here the development of a national WBE program across 28 WWTPs serving 
50% of the population of Scotland, including large conurbations, as well as
low-density rural and remote island communities. For each WWTP catchment area, we
quantified spatial and temporal relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
wastewater and COVID-19 cases. Daily WWTP SARS-CoV-2 influent viral RNA load,
calculated using daily influent flow rates, had the strongest correlation (ρ >
0.9) with COVID-19 cases within a catchment. As the incidence of COVID-19 cases
within a community increased, a linear relationship emerged between cases and
influent viral RNA load. There were significant differences between WWTPs in
their capacity to predict case numbers based on influent viral RNA load, with the
limit of detection ranging from 25 cases for larger plants to a single case in
smaller plants. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load can be used to predict the number of
cases detected in the WWTP catchment area, with a clear statistically significant
relationship observed above site-specific case thresholds.
