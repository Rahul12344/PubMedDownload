The association of previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure [hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) negative, hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc/HBcAb) positive]
with disease severity and decision on treatment option in primary immune
thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients remains unclear. Data from 725 patients diagnosed
with ITP were analyzed to elucidate the association between anti-HBc serological 
status and disease severity. Data from a published prospective study [high-dose
dexamethasone (HD-DXM), HD-DXM plus recombinant human thrombopoietin,
NCT01734044] and two retrospective studies (standard-dose and low-dose rituximab)
were rearranged to evaluate the impact of anti-HBc serological status on the
response and outcome to ITP-specific treatments and the risk of HBV reactivation 
related to these treatments. The prevalence of HBsAg- HBcAb+ and HBsAg- HBcAb- in
ITP patients was 51·03% and 48·97% respectively. Compared to the HBsAg- HBcAb-
group, patients in the HBsAg- HBcAb+ group had lower platelet count, higher
bleeding score, and longer hospitalization (P = 0·002, 0·033, and 0·008
respectively). Moreover, the initial complete response rate of HBsAg- HBcAb+
patients was lower than that of HBsAg- HBcAb- patients (45·2% vs 59·8%,
P = 0·027). In conclusion, previous HBV exposure was correlated with disease
severity and hospitalization in ITP patients. Anti-HBc positivity may be
considered as a predictor for poor response to ITP-specific treatments.
