Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between passengers on airplanes is a significant
concern and reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses aboard
aircraft could save lives. Solving the Airplane Seating Assignment Problem (ASAP)
produces seating arrangements that minimize transmission risks between passengers
aboard an aircraft, but the chosen risk model affects the optimal seating
arrangement. We analyze previous risk models and introduce two new risk models,
masked and unmasked, based on previous experiments performed aboard real aircraft
to test aerosol dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 sized particles. We make recommendations
on when each risk model is applicable and the types of seating arrangements that 
are optimal for each risk model.
