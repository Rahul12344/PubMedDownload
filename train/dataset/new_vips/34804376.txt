Purpose of Review: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 presented a multitude of
challenges for physicians nationwide. Standard of care treatment was tailored to 
protect patients from virus exposure, while delivering safe and adequate care.
This article reviews the steps taken to treat and protect breast cancer patients 
during the pandemic and reentry approaches to resume care.
Recent Findings: Breast cancer experts rapidly convened to develop treatment
guidelines during the pandemic. These recommendations encompass screening
approach, prioritization of breast cancer patients, educational modifications,
research and data considerations, and a re-entry treatment approach as the
pandemic evolved. Without prior experience with a pandemic of this magnitude,
these guidelines were based on expert knowledge and previously established data.
Summary: This emergency forced physicians to operate in a more efficient and
effective manner to deliver value-based patient care, and future evaluation of
these adjustments will determine if overall patient outcomes were compromised.
