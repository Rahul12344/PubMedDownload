Elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have long been
underrepresented in studies on vaccine efficacy, particularly in light of
currently emerging variants of concern (VOCs). In this prospective observational 
cohort study, we analyzed serological immune responses in 190 individuals before,
3 weeks after 1st and 3 weeks after 2nd vaccination with BNT162b2. Unvaccinated
COVID-19-convalescent subjects served as reference. End points comprised serum
anti-spike IgG and IgA titers as well as neutralization capacities against
unmutated and mutated SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains including B.1.1.7,
B.1.351 and P.1. We found that antibody titers and neutralization capacities up
to 3 weeks after 2nd vaccination with BNT162b2 were significantly higher in
COVID-19-convalescent as compared to COVID-19-naive vaccinees. Moreover,
pre-vaccination anti-NCP IgG titers, but not age or gender, had a high impact on 
the strength and kinetics of post-vaccination neutralization capacity
development. Most importantly, BNT162b2-induced neutralization capacity was
cross-reactive with VOCs. In contrast to unvaccinated convalescents, vaccinated
convalescent individuals of all ages acquired strong neutralizing capacities
against current VOCs. The present study suggests that COVID-19-convalescent
individuals with a broad age range between 18 and 98 years benefit from BNT162b2 
vaccination by developing strong and broad neutralizing immune responses against 
SARS-CoV-2 including current VOCs.
