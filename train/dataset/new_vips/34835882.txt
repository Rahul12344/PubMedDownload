In view of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, the
research community is focusing on development of diagnostics, treatment, and
vaccines to halt or reverse this scenario. Although there are already various
vaccines available, adaptive mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can alter its
pathogenic potential and, at the same time, increase the difficulty of developing
drugs or immunization by vaccines. Nanotechnology carries a potential to act in
all stages in fighting this viral disease, with several possibilities of
strategies such as applying nanoparticles directly as antivirals in delivery
systems against these viruses or incorporating them in materials, with power of
achievement in therapeutics, vaccines and prevention. In this paper, we review
and bring insights of recent studies using metal nanocomposites as antivirals
against coronavirus and structurally similar viruses.
