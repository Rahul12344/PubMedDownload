Can Monocytopenia Be a New Indicator in Determining Survival in Covid-19 Disease?

BACKGROUND: Monocytes play a central role in Covid-19 infection. Monocytopenia is
especially observed in patients with severe infection. In our study, we aimed to 
investigate the effects of monocytopenia on survival in patients presenting with 
the suspicion of Covid-19.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who received inpatient or outpatient
treatment in the pandemic clinic of Umraniye Training and Research Hospital
between April 2020 and July 2020 were included in our retrospective cohort study.
Patients were divided into two groups, severe and non-severe. Demographic data,
laboratory parameters, those who were monocytopenic at presentation, those who
developed monocytopenia during follow-up, and those with persistent monocytopenia
were noted.
RESULTS: The study included 471 patients with a mean age of 50.4 Â± 18.2 years.
Sixty-seven (14.2%) patients had severe and 404 (85.8%) had non-severe disease.
The minimum value of monocytes detected during the follow-up in severe patients
was significantly lower (p < 0.001). As patients were grouped into those with
monocytopenia at the time of admission, those with monocytopenia developing
during their follow-up, and those whose monocytopenia at admission persisted,
they were compared with regards to the presence or absence of severe disease.
Newly developing monocytopenia and persistent monocytopenia were significant in
patients with severe disease (p < 0.001, p = 0,001 respectively). Also, among
non-surviving patients, there was a significant difference in survival times in
the monocytopenia group (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found more developing and persistent monocytopenia 
in the severe group, and the survival time was low, especially in those with
newly developing monocytopenia. The development of monocytopenia in the daily
hemogram follow-up of the patients may increase the possibility of mortality,
which suggests that monocytopenia may be a new marker in determining survival.
