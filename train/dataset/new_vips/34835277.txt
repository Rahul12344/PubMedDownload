We developed a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (CoV-RBD121-NP) comprised of a
tobacco mosaic virus-like nanoparticle conjugated to the receptor-binding domain 
of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain.
CoV-RBD121-NP elicits strong antibody responses in C57BL/6 mice and is stable for
up to 12 months at 2-8 or 22-28 °C. Here, we showed that this vaccine induces a
strong neutralizing antibody response in K18-hACE2 mice. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that immunization protects mice from virus-associated mortality and 
symptomatic disease. Our data indicated that a sufficient pre-existing pool of
neutralizing antibodies is required to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication upon
exposure and prevent induction of inflammatory mediators associated with severe
disease. Finally, we identified a potential role for CXCL5 as a protective
cytokine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggested that disruption of the
CXCL5 and CXCL1/2 axis may be important early components of the inflammatory
dysregulation that is characteristic of severe cases of COVID-19.
