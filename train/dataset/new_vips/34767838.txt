OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection causes high mortality in pregnant
women of developing regions during large outbreaks. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the clinical features of HEV-infected pregnant women in Shanghai,
China where the epidemiology of HEV has shifted from large outbreaks to the
sporadic form.
METHODS: Clinical data of 516 pregnant and nonpregnant child-bearing age women
diagnosed with HEV infection during 2009-2020 was collected at the Shanghai
Public Health Clinical center. Patients' data were analysed for clinical features
and laboratory parameters accordingly.
RESULTS: Most of the hospitalized HEV-infected pregnant women (85.23%, 127/149)
showed no obvious clinical symptoms and the disease outcome was generally benign 
with no liver failure or maternal mortality observed in the patients. By
comparison, fewer (37.21%, 32/86) of the HEV-infected nonpregnant women were
asymptomatic, and five cases (5.81%, 5/86) of liver failure were observed among
them. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,
total bilirubin (TBiL), direct bilirubin (DBiL) and total bile acids (TBA) were
significantly higher (P < 0.05) in nonpregnant women than those of the pregnant
women. We found 42.99% (46/107) births had adverse foetal/neonatal outcome.
Mothers who presented with adverse foetal/neonatal outcome showed higher (P <
0.05) serum TBiL, DBiL and TBA levels than those without.
CONCLUSION: We found that the clinical features of sporadic HEV infection in
pregnant women in Shanghai, China are generally mild and no maternal mortality
occurred. However foetal/neonatal adverse outcomes including preterm births and
stillbirths were observed in HEV-infected pregnant women.
