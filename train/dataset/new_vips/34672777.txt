Dysfunctional immune activation accumulates during chronic viral infection and
contributes to disease pathogenesis. In HIV-1, immune activation is exacerbated
by concurrent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), accelerating depletion of
CD4+ T cells. HIV-1 suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART) generally
reconstitutes CD4+ T cell counts, while also reducing the proportion that is
activated. Whether this immune reconstitution also reduces the complexity of the 
CD4+ T cell population is unknown. We sought to characterize the relationship
between activated CD4+ T cell repertoire diversity and immune reconstitution
following ART in HIV-1/HCV coinfection. We extracted T cell receptor (TCR)
sequences from RNA sequencing data obtained from activated CD4+ T cells of
HIV-1/HCV coinfected individuals before and after treatment with ART (clinical
trial NCT01285050). There was notable heterogeneity in both the extent of CD4+ T 
cell reconstitution and in the change in activated CD4+ TCR repertoire diversity 
following ART. Decreases in activated CD4+ TCR repertoire diversity following ART
were predictive of the degree of CD4+ T cell reconstitution. The association of
decreased activated CD4+ TCR repertoire diversity and improved CD4+ T cell
reconstitution may represent loss of nonspecifically activated TCR clonotypes,
and possibly selective expansion of specifically activated CD4+ clones. These
results provide insight into the dynamic relationship between activated CD4+ TCR 
diversity and CD4+ T cell recovery of HIV-1/HCV coinfected individuals after
suppression of HIV-1 viremia.
