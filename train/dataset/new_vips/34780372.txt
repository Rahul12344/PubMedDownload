INTRODUCTION: The conventional interferon therapy of hepatitis C virus has been
substituted substantially with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir due to constraints in
efficacy and tolerability. This study aimed diagnostically to monitor the
effectiveness and side effects of direct-acting antivirals in the management of
HCV infections.
METHODOLOGY: This prospective study was conducted on HCV-infected patients
treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Different serological, biochemical,
hematological, and molecular techniques were used for the assessment of patients.
Only treatment-naive patients aged ≥ 18 to 75 years received 12 weeks of
treatment. The primary endpoint was a sustained virologic response with
undetectable HCV RNA in the patients' serum at the end of the treatment.
RESULTS: We identified 229 cases of confirmed HCV infections by PCR, 94.3% of
which had genotype 3. The study population comprised 66% females and 34% males
with a median age of 42.2 ± 10.6 SD. Ninety-three percent of the patients
accomplished SVR at week 12. The combined therapy of SOF/DAC achieved the highest
efficacy rate (92.6%) among the different HCV genotype 3 patients. A
statistically significant relationship was observed between low baseline viral
load (p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.2-3.1) and HCV genotype 3 with minor side effects,
including lethargy, headache, nausea, insomnia, diarrhea, and fever.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV-infected patients can be treated well with an interferon-free
SOF/DAC regimen, tolerated with generally mild adverse effects with a higher SVR.
