Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a highly transmissible intestinal pathogen
that causes mild to severe clinical symptoms, such as anorexia, vomiting, and
watery diarrhea in pigs. By comparing the genetic sequences of the spike
glycoprotein between historical and current Taiwanese PDCoV strains, we
identified a novel PDCoV variant that displaced the PDCoV responsible for the
2015 epidemic. This PDCoV variant belongs to a young population within the US
lineage, and infected pigs carry high concentrations of the virus. It also has
several critical point mutations and an amino acid insertion at position 52 that 
may enhance the affinity between the B-cell epitopes located in the N-terminal
domain with its complementarity regions, consequently facilitating binding or
penetration between the fusion peptide and cellular membrane. Furthermore, viral 
protein structure prediction demonstrated that these amino acid changes may
change the ability of the virus to bind to the receptor, which may consequently
alter virus infectivity. Our results hence suggest the emergence of new PDCoV
strains in Taiwan with the potential for greater transmission and pathogenesis.
