Culicoides-borne viruses such as bluetongue, African horse sickness, and
Schmallenberg virus cause major economic burdens due to animal outbreaks in
Africa and their emergence in Europe and Asia. However, little is known about the
role of Culicoides as vectors for zoonotic arboviruses. In this study, we
identify both veterinary and zoonotic arboviruses in pools of Culicoides biting
midges in South Africa, during 2012-2017. Midges were collected at six
surveillance sites in three provinces and screened for Alphavirs, Flavivirus,
Orthobunyavirus, and Phlebovirus genera; equine encephalosis virus (EEV); and
Rhaboviridae, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In total,
66/331 (minimum infection rate (MIR) = 0.4) pools tested positive for one or more
arbovirus. Orthobunyaviruses, including Shuni virus (MIR = 0.1) and EEV (MIR =
0.2) were more readily detected, while only 2/66 (MIR = 0.1) Middelburg virus and
4/66 unknown Rhabdoviridae viruses (MIR = 0.0) were detected. This study suggests
Culicoides as potential vectors of both veterinary and zoonotic arboviruses
detected in disease outbreaks in Africa, which may contribute to the emergence of
these viruses to new regions.
