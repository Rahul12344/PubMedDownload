We investigated the seasonal prevalence of seven enteric viruses in
groundwater-derived public water sources distributed across the dominant aquifers
of England. Sampling targeted four periods in the hydrological cycle with
typically varying microbial risks, as indicated using a decade of Escherichia
coli prevalence data. Viruses were concentrated onsite by filtration of raw
groundwater, and extracted nucleic acid (NA) was amplified by qPCR or RT-qPCR.
Seven out of eight sources, all aquifers, and 31% of samples were positive for
viral NA. The most frequently detected viral NA targets were Hepatitis A virus
(17% samples, 63% sites), norovirus GI (14% samples, 38% sites), and Hepatitis E 
virus (7% samples, 25% sites). Viral NA presence was episodic, being most
prevalent and at its highest concentration during November and January, the main 
groundwater recharge season, with 89% of all positive detects occurring during a 
rising water table. Seasonal norovirus NA detections matched its seasonal
incidence within the population. Viral NA is arriving with groundwater recharge, 
as opposed to persisting for long-periods within the saturated zone. Neither
total coliforms nor E. coli were significant predictors of viral NA
presence-absence, and there was limited co-occurrence between viruses.
Nevertheless, a source with an absence of E. coli in regularly collected
historical data is unlikely to be at risk of viral contamination. To manage
potential groundwater viral contamination via risk assessment, larger scale
studies are required to understand key risk factors, with the evidence here
suggesting viral NA is widespread across a range of typical microbial risk
settings.
