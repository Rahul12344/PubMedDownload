BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an epidemic of critical patients,
some of whom have been treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
This purpose of study is to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 patients
treated with ECMO.
METHODS: A multicentered study of critical patients with COVID-19 treated at six 
hospitals in Daegu was conducted between January and April 2020.
RESULTS: Among the 80 patients receiving mechanical ventilation support, 19 (24%)
were treated with ECMO included (median age 63.0 years). Eight of the 19 patients
(42%) were weaned off ECMO (9.8 days, IQR 7.0-13.7). Among them, four patients
were also weaned off mechanical ventilation (33.4 days, IQR 29.3 - 35.7), three
were still receiving mechanical ventilation (50.9 days), and one expired after
ECMO weaning. According to the univariate analysis, the factor that was
associated with successful ECMO weaning was vitamin B12 treatment (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, ECMO weaning and mortality rates were 
42% and 58%, respectively.
