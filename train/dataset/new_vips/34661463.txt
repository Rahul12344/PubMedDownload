Geospatial Distribution of Ophthalmologists Older than Age 60 Years Relative to
the Prevalence of COVID-19.

Rasendran C, Haueisen AJ, Wadhwa R, Singh RP.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases
as of February 1, 2021 and the proportion of ophthalmologists in the United
States older than age 60 years to provide a framework for successful vaccine
distribution for the ophthalmology workforce.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Association of American Medical Colleges
ophthalmologist workforce dataset (from 2019) for each state was combined with
John Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking data to determine exposure risk for
ophthalmologists, especially those older than age 60 years.
RESULTS: Of the 18,915 practicing ophthalmologists in the US, 37.6% are older
than age 60 years. North Dakota (48.4%), Connecticut (46.8%), and Maine (46.7%)
have the highest percentages. South Dakota (9,567), Utah (7,559), and Idaho
(7,411) currently have the highest COVID-19 exposure burden per ophthalmologist
older than age 60 years as of February 1, 2021.
CONCLUSION: Care must be taken to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine in a safe and
proactive manner to ophthalmologists that face high exposure risk, both to ensure
physician safety and ensure adequate care for the population they serve.
