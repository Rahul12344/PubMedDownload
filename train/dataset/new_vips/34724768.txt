Ticks can transmit pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and viruses to humans and
animals. In this study, we investigated the microbiomes of Haemaphysalis
longicornis according to sex and life stages. The Shannon index was significantly
higher for nymphs than adult ticks. Principal coordinates analysis showed that
the microbiome composition of female adult and male adult ticks were different.
Notably, Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519), known as a tick symbiont, was found 
in all nymphs and female adult ticks, but only one out of 4 male adult ticks had 
Coxiella-like bacterium (AB001519). In addition, Rickettsia rickettsii, Coxiella 
burnetii, and Anaplasma bovis were detected in this study.
