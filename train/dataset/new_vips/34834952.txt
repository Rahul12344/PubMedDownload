African swine fever virus (ASFV) is one of the pathogens of highest concern
worldwide. Despite different virus lineages co-circulating in several areas, dual
infections in the same animal have been rarely observed, suggesting that ASF
superinfections are infrequent events. Here we present the first genome-wide
detection and analysis of two intragenotype dual ASFV infections. The dual
infections have been detected in a hunted wild boar and in a pig carcass, both
infected by ASFV genotype I in Sardinia in 1984 and 2018, respectively. We
characterize the genetic differences between the two sequences, their intra-host 
frequency, and their phylogenetic relationship among fully sequenced ASFV strains
from Sardinia. Both dual infections involve pairs of closely related but
different viruses that were circulating in Sardinia in the same period. The
results imply that dual ASFV infections or similar ASFV strains are more common
than expected, especially in ASF endemic areas, albeit difficult to detect.
