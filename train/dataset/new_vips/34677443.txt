Crustins are cysteine-rich cationic antimicrobial peptides with diverse
biological functions including antimicrobial and proteinase inhibitory activities
in crustaceans. Although a few crustins reportedly respond to white spot syndrome
virus (WSSV) infection, the detailed antiviral mechanisms of crustins remain
largely unknown. Our previous research has shown that SpCrus2, from mud crab
Scylla paramamosain, is a type II crustin containing a glycine-rich region (GRR) 
and a cysteine-rich region (CRR). In the present study, we found that SpCrus2 was
upregulated in gills after WSSV challenge. Knockdown of SpCrus2 by injecting
double-stranded RNA (dsSpCrus2) resulted in remarkably increased virus copies in 
mud crabs after infection with WSSV. These results suggested that SpCrus2 played 
a critical role in the antiviral immunity of mud crab. A GST pull-down assay
showed that recombinant SpCrus2 interacted specifically with WSSV structural
protein VP26, and this result was further confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation
assay with Drosophila S2 cells. As the signature sequence of type II crustin,
SpCrus2 GRR is a glycine-rich cationic polypeptide with amphipathic properties.
Our study demonstrated that the GRR and CRR of SpCrus2 exhibited binding
activities to VP26, with the former displaying more potent binding ability than
the latter. Interestingly, pre-incubating WSSV particles with recombinant SpCrus2
(rSpCrus2), rGRR, or rCRR inhibited virus proliferation in vivo; moreover,
rSpCrus2 and rGRR possessed similar antiviral abilities, which were much stronger
than those of rCRR. These findings indicated that SpCrus2 GRR contributed largely
to the antiviral ability of SpCrus2, and that the stronger antiviral ability of
GRR might result from its stronger binding activity to the viral structural
protein. Overall, this study provided new insights into the antiviral mechanism
of SpCrus2 and the development of new antiviral drugs.
