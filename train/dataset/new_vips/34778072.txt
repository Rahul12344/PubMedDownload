The oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persistently infects more than 95% of the 
human adult population. Even so it can readily transform human B cells after
infection in vitro, it only rarely causes tumors in patients. A substantial
proportion of the 1% of all human cancers that are associated with EBV occurs
during coinfections, including those with the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the also oncogenic and
closely EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). In this review,
I will discuss how these infections interact with EBV, modify its immune control,
and shape its tumorigenesis. The underlying mechanisms reveal new aspects of
EBV-associated pathologies and point toward treatment possibilities for their
prevention by the human immune system.
