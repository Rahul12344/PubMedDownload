Under the variant climate conditions in the transitional regions between tropics 
and subtropics, the impacts of climate factors on influenza subtypes have rarely 
been evaluated. With the available influenza A (Flu-A) and influenza B (Flu-B)
outbreak data in Shenzhen, China, which is an excellent example of a transitional
marine climate, the associations of multiple climate variables with these
outbreaks were explored in this study. Daily laboratory-confirmed influenza virus
and climate data were collected from 2009 to 2015. Potential impacts of daily
mean/maximum/minimum temperatures (T/Tmax/Tmin), relative humidity (RH), wind
velocity (V), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) were analyzed using the
distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) and generalized additive model (GAM).
Under its local climate partitions, Flu-A mainly prevailed in summer months (May 
to June), and a second peak appeared in early winter (December to January). Flu-B
outbreaks usually occurred in transitional seasons, especially in autumn.
Although low temperature caused an instant increase in both Flu-A and Flu-B
risks, its effect could persist for up to 10 days for Flu-B and peak at 17 C
(relative risk (RR) = 14.16, 95% CI: 7.46-26.88). For both subtypes,
moderate-high temperature (28 C) had a significant but delayed effect on
influenza, especially for Flu-A (RR = 26.20, 95% CI: 13.22-51.20). The Flu-A
virus was sensitive to RH higher than 76%, while higher Flu-B risks were observed
at both low (< 65%) and high (> 83%) humidity. Flu-A was active for a short term 
after exposure to large DTR (e.g., DTR = 10 C, RR = 12.45, 95% CI: 6.50-23.87),
whereas Flu-B mainly circulated under stable temperatures. Although the overall
wind speed in Shenzhen was low, moderate wind (2-3 m/s) was found to favor the
outbreaks of both subtypes. This study revealed the thresholds of various
climatic variables promoting influenza outbreaks, as well as the distinctions
between the flu subtypes. These data can be helpful in predicting seasonal
influenza outbreaks and minimizing the impacts, based on integrated forecast
systems coupled with short-term climate models.
