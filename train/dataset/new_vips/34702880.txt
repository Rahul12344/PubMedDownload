During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions
enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic
lines. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure
employment are better able to adhere to mobility restrictions, due to
occupational factors that link the capacity for flexible work arrangements to
income security. We use high-resolution spatial data on household internet
traffic as a surrogate for adaptation to home-based work, together with the
geographical clustering of occupation types, to investigate the relationship
between occupational factors and increased internet traffic during work hours
under lockdown in two Australian cities. By testing our hypothesis based on the
observed trends, and exploring demographic factors associated with divergences
from our hypothesis, we are left with a picture of unequal impact dominated by
two major influences: the types of occupations in which people are engaged, and
the composition of households and families. During lockdown, increased internet
traffic was correlated with income security and, when school activity was
conducted remotely, to the proportion of families with children. Our findings
suggest that response planning and provision of social and economic support for
residents within lockdown areas should explicitly account for income security and
household structure. Overall, the results we present contribute to the emerging
picture of the impacts of COVID-19 on human behaviour, and will help policy
makers to understand the balance between public health and social impact in
making decisions about mitigation policies.
