The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by a pathogenic virus called Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therapies against
SARS-CoV-2 target the virus or human cells or the immune system. However,
therapies based on specific antibodies, such as vaccines and monoclonal
antibodies, may become inefficient enough when the virus changes its antigenicity
due to mutations. Polyphenols are the major class of bioactive compounds in
nature, exerting diverse health effects based on their direct antioxidant
activity and their effects in the modulation of intracellular signaling. There
are currently numerous clinical trials investigating the effects of polyphenols
in prophylaxis and the treatment of COVID-19, from symptomatic, via moderate and 
severe COVID-19 treatment, to anti-fibrotic treatment in discharged COVID-19
patients. Antiviral activities of polyphenols and their impact on immune system
modulation could serve as a solid basis for developing polyphenol-based natural
approaches for preventing and treating COVID-19.
