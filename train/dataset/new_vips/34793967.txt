BACKGROUND: Viral hepatitis is a global health problem with unequal distribution 
of disease burden in which low-income people are at higher risk for acquisition
and underlying liver diseases. This study aimed to seek the prevalence of
hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, and liver damage among low-income patients
attending a public tertiary care hospital in West Mexico.
METHODS: A retrospective/cross-sectional study at the Department of Genomic
Medicine in Hepatology was conducted between March 1, 2016 to March 30, 2017. A
total of 10,352 patients tested for anti-HCV, HBsAg, or anti-HIV (n=23,074) were 
included. Age, gender, and hospital service were registered. Liver fibrosis was
assessed using APRI and FIB-4 scores.
RESULTS: Overall, 3.9% were anti-HCV+ (305/7848), 1.0% were HBsAg+ (80/7894), and
2.9% were anti-HIV+ (210/7332). A 43.8% (750/1959) of patients negative for all
viruses had either abnormal AST, ALT, or GGT (≥40 UI/L). Also, significant liver 
fibrosis (APRI ≥ 0.7) was prevalent in 10.6% (191/1804). In patients who tested
positive for viral infections, liver fibrosis was detected in 20.4% (11/54) of
HBsAg+, 34.2% (53/155) in anti-HCV+ and 15.5% (16/103) in anti-HIV+. Anti-HCV+
was highest in Geriatrics (11.1%), HBsAg+ in HIV patients (3.0%) and anti-HIV+ in
Emergency room attendees (33.3%).
CONCLUSION: High seroprevalence of HCV, HBV, and HIV infections was found among
the studied population. Significant liver fibrosis was detected in negative and
positive patients for viral infections. Medical services need to continuously
test for viral infections, promote early detection of chronic liver damage and
identify target patients for elimination strategies to decrease disease burden.
