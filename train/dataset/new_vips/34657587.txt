BACKGROUND: Kruskal-Wallis H test from the bank of classical statistics tests is 
a well-known nonparametric alternative to a one-way analysis of variance. The
test is extensively used in decision-making problems where one has to compare the
equality of several means when the observations are in exact form. The test is
helpless when the data is in an interval form and has some indeterminacy.
METHODS: The interval-valued data often contain uncertainty and imprecision and
often arise from situations that contain vagueness and ambiguity. In this
research, a modified form of the Kruskal-Wallis H test has been proposed for
indeterminacy data. A comprehensive theoretical methodology with an application
and implementation of the test has been proposed in the research.
RESULTS: The proposed test is applied on a Covid-19 data set for application
purposes. The study results suggested that the proposed modified Kruskal-Wallis H
test is more suitable in interval-valued data situations. The application of this
new neutrosophic Kruskal-Wallis test on the Covid-19 data set showed that the
proposed test provides more relevant and adequate results. The data representing 
the daily ICU occupancy by the Covid-19 patients were recorded for both
determinate and indeterminate parts. The existing nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H 
test under Classical Statistics would have given misleading results. The proposed
test showed that at a 1% level of significance, there is a statistically
significant difference among the average daily ICU occupancy by corona-positive
patients of different age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the results suggested that our proposed modified
form of the Kruskal-Wallis is appropriate in place of the classical form of the
test in the presence of the neutrosophic environment.
