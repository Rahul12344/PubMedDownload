Solid organ transplantation is often lifesaving, but does carry an increased risk
of infection. Respiratory viral infections are one of the most prevalent
infections, and are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, especially
among lung transplant recipients. There is also data to suggest an association
with acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction in lung transplant
recipients. Respiratory viral infections can appear at any time post-transplant
and are usually acquired in the community. All respiratory viral infections share
similar clinical manifestations and are all currently diagnosed using nucleic
acid testing. Influenza has good treatment options and prevention strategies,
although these are hampered by resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and lower
vaccine immunogenicity in the transplant population. Other respiratory viruses,
unfortunately, have limited treatments and preventive methods. This review
summarizes the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, therapies and preventive
measures for clinically significant RNA and DNA respiratory viruses, with the
exception of SARS-CoV-2. This area is fast evolving and hopefully the coming
decades will bring us new antivirals, immunologic treatments and vaccines.
