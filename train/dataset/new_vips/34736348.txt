AIM: To describe how children in Sweden accessed and perceived information about 
SARS-CoV2 and Covid-19 during the first phase of the outbreak.
METHODS: This study is a substudy of an international cross-sectional online
mixed methods survey examining elements of children's health literacy in relation
to Covid-19. The survey included multiple-choice questions, open-ended questions 
and drawings and collected information from 50 Swedish children (7-12 years).
Data were analysed concurrently on a descriptive level using statistics and
content analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data, including the drawings, were
considered equally important and resulted in six categories, illuminating how
children accessed and perceived information about the pandemic.
RESULTS: The survey showed that children accessed information mainly from school 
but also from TV. They preferred information from reliable sources. Children
reported the information they accessed as easy to understand and it prompted them
to ask new questions. They reported they knew a lot about the pandemic, for
example, the potential danger to themselves and others and how to act to protect 
themselves and others. They perceived the pandemic as an intrusion on their
lives.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that Swedish children between 7 and 12 years
old were well informed about SARS-CoV2 and Covid-19 during the first phase of the
pandemic. School was shown to be an important source of information. The children
could explain how to act to protect themselves and others from becoming infected 
by the virus.
