2021.

This study explored rates of death by suicide by birth cohort including Baby
Boomers (1946-1964), Generation X (1965-1980), Millennials (1981-1996), and
Generation Z (1997-2012), among active component U.S. Army soldiers during 1
January 2000-4 June 2021. From 1 January 2008 through 4 June 2021, the most
likely cluster of suicides, although not statistically significant, was
identified between March 2020 and June 2021, which coincided with the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Army has observed 55%-82% increases in suicide rates among Millennials,
Generation Z, and Generation X compared to 1 year before the pandemic. The
largest proportional increase in rates affected the members of Generation X, but 
the highest rates both before and after the onset of the pandemic affected those 
in Generation Z. Discussion of the findings introduces theories that have been
used to explain psychological states that may predispose to suicidal behavior and
posits ways in which Army leaders and organizations may be able to reduce suicide
risk among soldiers. The limitations of the study and possible additional
inquiries are described.
