Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden causing
severe complications like liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Curative
treatment options are lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new
therapeutic options. Immunotherapy with the goal to restore dysfunctional
HBV-specific T cell immunity is an interesting new therapeutic strategy. Based on
current evidence on dysfunction of the HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response in
chronic HBV infection, we will review the growing field of immunotherapeutic
approaches for treatment of chronic HBV infection. The review will focus on
therapies targeting T cells and will cover checkpoint inhibitors, T cell
engineering, Toll-like receptor agonists and therapeutic vaccination.
