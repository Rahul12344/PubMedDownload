BACKGROUND: Detailed characteristics of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in
Burkina Faso are scarce. The main aim of this study was to assess HCV
seroprevalence in various settings and populations at risk in Burkina Faso
between 1990 and 2020. Secondary objectives included the prevalence of HCV
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the distribution of HCV genotypes.
METHODS: A systematic database search, supplemented by a manual search, was
conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and African Index Medicus. Studies
reporting HCV seroprevalence data in low and high-risk populations in Burkina
Faso were included, and a random-effects meta-analysis was applied. Risk of bias 
was assessed using the Joanna Briggs institute checklist.
RESULTS: Low-risk populations were examined in 31 studies involving a total of
168,151 subjects, of whom 8330 were positive for HCV antibodies. Six studies
included a total of 1484 high-risk persons, and 96 had antibodies to HCV. The
pooled seroprevalence in low-risk populations was 3.72% (95% CI: 3.20-4.28) and
4.75% (95% CI: 1.79-8.94) in high-risk groups. A non-significant decreasing trend
was observed over the study period. Seven studies tested HCV RNA in a total of
4759 individuals at low risk for HCV infection, and 81 were positive. The
meta-analysis of HCV RNA yielded a pooled prevalence of 1.65% (95% CI:
0.74-2.89%) in low-risk populations, which is assumed to be indicative of HCV
prevalence in the general population of Burkina Faso and suggests that about
301,174 people are active HCV carriers in the country. Genotypes 2 and 1 were the
most frequent, with 60.3% and 25.0%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV seroprevalence is intermediate in Burkina Faso and indicates the
need to implement effective control strategies. There is a paucity of data at the
national level and for rural and high-risk populations. General population
screening and linkage to care are recommended, with special attention to rural
and high-risk populations.
