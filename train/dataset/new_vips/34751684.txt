Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel infectious 
member of the coronavirus family, has caused millions of cases of infection and
deaths all over the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization. Conventional laboratory-based diagnostic testing has faced extreme 
difficulties in meeting the overwhelming demand for testing worldwide, and this
has brought about a pressing need for cost-effective rapid diagnosis. There has
been a surge in the number of prototypes of diagnostic kits developed, although
many of these have been found to be lacking in terms of their accuracy and
sensitivity. One type of chip-based diagnostic platform is the aptamer-based
biosensor. Aptamers are artificially synthesized oligonucleotides that are
capable of specifically binding to a target antigen. As of now, some aptamers
have been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Although many ultrasensitive aptasensors have 
been developed for viruses, few have been successfully adapted for SARS-CoV-2
detection. Our review discusses the recent developments in the domain of
SARS-CoV-2 specific aptamer isolation, the design of electrochemical and optical 
aptasensors, and the implications of aptasensor-based COVID-19 diagnosis.
