The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is one of the most endangered mammals in
the world; anthropogenic habitat loss and poaching still threaten the survival of
wild pandas. Viral infection has become one of the potential threats to the
health of these animals, but the available information related to these
infections is still limited. In order to detect possible vertebrate viruses, the 
virome in the fecal samples of seven wild giant pandas from Qinling Mountains was
investigated by using the method of viral metagenomics. From the fecal virome of 
wild giant pandas, we determined six nearly complete genomes belonging to the
order Picornavirales, two of which may be qualified as a novel virus family or
genus. In addition, four complete genomes belonging to the Genomoviridae family
were also fully characterized. This virological investigation has increased our
understanding of the gut viral community in giant pandas. Whether these viruses
detected in fecal samples can really infect giant panda needs further research.
