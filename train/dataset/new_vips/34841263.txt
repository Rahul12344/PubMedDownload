The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona Virus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 and its spread worldwide caused an acute pandemic of
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Since then, COVID-19 has been under intense
scrutiny as its outbreak led to significant changes in healthcare, social
activities, and economic settings worldwide. Although angiotensin-converting
enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor is shown to be the primary port of SARS-CoV-2 entry in 
cells, the mechanisms behind the establishment and pathologies of COVID-19 are
poorly understood. As recent studies have shown that host mitochondria play an
essential role in virus-mediated innate immune response, pathologies, and
infection, in this review, we will discuss in detail the entry and progression of
SARS-CoV-2 and how mitochondria could play roles in COVID-19 disease. We will
also review the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria and
discuss possible treatments, including whether mitochondria as a potential
therapeutic target in COVID-19. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial
interactions mediated virus establishment, inflammation, and other consequences
may provide a unique mechanism and conceptual advancement in finding a novel
treatment for COVID-19.
