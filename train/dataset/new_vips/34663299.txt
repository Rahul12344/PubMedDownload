BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic affected the career choice of healthcare
professionals and students. Career choice regret of healthcare professionals and 
students during COVID-19 outbreak and its affected factors are largely
unexplored.
METHODS: Convenience sample of nurses, doctors, and medical students were
recruited from hospitals and universities nationwide. The data collected
including demographic information, professional value before and after the
COVID-19 outbreak, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and career choice regret
level by an online questionnaire. Multinominal logistic regression was employed
to explore the factors associated with career choice regret.
RESULTS: In total, 9322 participants of convenience sampling were enrolled in,
including 5786 nurses, 1664 doctors, and 1872 medical students. 6.7% participants
had career choice regret. Multinominal logistic regression analysis showed,
compared to participants with no regret, that as levels of psychological
resilience increased, the odds of experiencing career choice regret decreased
(OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96), while participants with lower professional value
evaluation after the COVID-19 outbreak had higher probability to experience
career choice regret (OR = 1.55,95% CI 1.50-1.61). Medical students were more
likely to regret than nurses (OR = 1.65,95% CI 1.20-2.28), participants whose
career/major choice was not their personal ideal had higher risk of experience
career choice regret (OR = 1.59,95% CI 1.29-1.96), while participants who were
very afraid of the coronavirus had higher risk to experience career choice regret
then participants with no fear at all (OR = 2.00,95% CI 1.24-3.21). As for the
medical students, results indicated that medical students major in nursing and
undergraduates had higher risk to experience career choice regret compared to
medical students major in clinical medicine and postgraduate (Master or PhD),
with an odds ratios of 2.65(95% CI 1.56-4.49) and 6.85 (95% CI
2.48-18.91)respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A minority of healthcare professionals and medical students
regretted their career choices during the COVID-19 outbreak. Enhance personal
psychological resilience and professional value would helpful to reduce career
choice regret among healthcare professionals and students during pandemic.
