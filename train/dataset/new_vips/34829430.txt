The design and development of biosensors, analytical devices used to detect
various analytes in different matrices, has emerged. Biosensors indicate a
biorecognition element with a physicochemical analyzer or detector, i.e., a
transducer. In the present scenario, various types of biosensors have been
deployed in healthcare and clinical research, for instance, biosensors for blood 
glucose monitoring. Pathogenic microbes are contributing mediators of numerous
infectious diseases that are becoming extremely serious worldwide. The recent
outbreak of COVID-19 is one of the most recent examples of such communal and
deadly diseases. In efforts to work towards the efficacious treatment of
pathogenic viral contagions, a fast and precise detection method is of the utmost
importance in biomedical and healthcare sectors for early diagnostics and timely 
countermeasures. Among various available sensor systems, optical biosensors offer
easy-to-use, fast, portable, handy, multiplexed, direct, real-time, and
inexpensive diagnosis with the added advantages of specificity and sensitivity.
Many progressive concepts and extremely multidisciplinary approaches, including
microelectronics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs), nanotechnologies,
molecular biology, and biotechnology with chemistry, are used to operate optical 
biosensors. A portable and handheld optical biosensing device would provide fast 
and reliable results for the identification and quantitation of pathogenic virus 
particles in each sample. In the modern day, the integration of intelligent
nanomaterials in the developed devices provides much more sensitive and highly
advanced sensors that may produce the results in no time and eventually help
clinicians and doctors enormously. This review accentuates the existing
challenges engaged in converting laboratory research to real-world device
applications and optical diagnostics methods for virus infections. The review's
background and progress are expected to be insightful to the researchers in the
sensor field and facilitate the design and fabrication of optical sensors for
life-threatening viruses with broader applicability to any desired pathogens.
