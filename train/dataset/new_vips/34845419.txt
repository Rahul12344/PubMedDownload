Objectives: Some DNA viruses, such as BKPyV, are capable of inducing neoplastic
transformation in human tissues through still unclear mechanisms. The goal of
this study is to investigate the carcinogenic potential of BK polyomavirus
(BKPyV) in human embryonic kidney 293 (Hek293) cells, dissecting the molecular
mechanism that determines the neoplastic transformation.
Materials and Methods: BKPyV, isolated from urine samples of infected patients,
was used to infect monolayers of Hek293 cells. Subsequently, intracellular redox 
changes, GSH/GSSH concentration by HPLC, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species
(ROS/RNS) production were monitored. Moreover, to understand the signaling
pathway underlying the neoplastic transformation, the redox-sensitive HFS1-Hsp27 
molecular axis was examined using the flavonoid quercetin and polishort hairpin
RNA technologies.
Results: The data obtained show that while BKPyV replication is closely linked to
the transcription factor p53, the increase in Hek293 cell proliferation is due to
the activation of the signaling pathway mediated by HSF1-Hsp27. In fact, its
inhibition blocks viral replication and cell growth, respectively.
Conclusions: The HSF1-Hsp27 signaling pathway is involved in BKPyV infection and 
cellular replication and its activation, which could be involved in cell
transformation.
