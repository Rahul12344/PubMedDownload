BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dyslipidemia in China is increasing annually.
Current studies suggest that dyslipidemia affects the antiviral efficacy of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies, while recent studies suggest that serum lipids
influence the response rates of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving
PEGylated interferon-alpha (Peg IFN-α) treatment. However, the role of
dyslipidemia in the efficacy of nucleoside (acid) analogues (NAs) in CHB patients
remains unclear.
METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2013, data from 179 treatment-naive
patients with CHB who were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and had visited
the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were assessed. Of
these patients, 68 were assigned to the dyslipidemia group (diagnosed with CHB
complicated with dyslipidemia) and 111 to the normolipidemic group. The following
3 treatment strategies were performed for all CHB patients over a 5-year period: 
lamivudine (LAM) plus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) combination therapy, telbivudine
(LdT) monotherapy, and entecavir (ETV) monotherapy. Serum assessments, blood
biochemistry, HBV serological markers, HBV DNA before treatment and HBeAg
serological conversion and virological responses at different timepoints after
treatment were compared between the two groups. Measurement data were compared by
τ tests and enumeration data by χ2 tests. Correlation analysis was performed
using binary logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The rates of HBeAg seroconversion in the dyslipidemia group at years 1, 
2, 3, and 4 were 10.3, 13.2, 17.6, and 22.1%, respectively, which were not
significantly lower than those of the normolipidemic group (11.7, 16.2, 18.0 and 
33.3%; χ2 = 0.085, 0.293, 0.004, and 2.601, respectively; Ρ > 0.05). However, the
rates of HBeAg seroconversion in the dyslipidemia group were significantly lower 
than those in the normolipidemic group at year 5 (27.9% vs. 43.2%, χ2 = 4.216,
Ρ < 0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed significant
differences in group, gender, PTA, ALT, AST, CR, and LDL-C between groups with
and without seroconversion. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that
dyslipidemia (OR = 1.993, Ρ = 0.038) and male gender (OR = 2.317, Ρ = 0.029) were
risk factors associated with HBeAg seroconversion.
CONCLUSIONS: During antiviral therapy, dyslipidemia affects HBeAg seroconversion 
in CHB patients treated with NAs, but does not affect the virological response.
