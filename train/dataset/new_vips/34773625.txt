For diagnosis of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, primers are usually 
raised against the sequence encoding capsid proteins, since structural proteins
are more conserved. This chapter focuses on the design of primers for a group of 
novel viruses lacking a capsid, known as papaya Umbra-like viruses (unassigned
genus) associated with Papaya Sticky Disease, which represent a threat to papaya 
production. Based on sequence alignments of a region encoding the RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase, universal primers to detect all the known viruses from four
countries are proposed. The Forward universal primer can be used in combination
with clade- and subclade-specific primers for rapid virus identification. We walk
the reader through downloading sequences from nucleotide databases, doing
sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construction to identify conserved and 
variable regions as valid primer targets; we also show how to design and analyze 
the primers.
