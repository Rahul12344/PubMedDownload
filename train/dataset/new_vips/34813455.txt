CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of human
immunodeficiency virus presented to the emergency department with odynophagia and
dysphagia for a month. Physical exam revealed Kaposi sarcoma partially occluding 
the airway. Point-of-care ultrasound was used to assist with the diagnosis of
reactive lymphadenopathy, and computed tomography revealed systemic disease.
Otolaryngology was urgently consulted, and the patient was admitted for prompt
tracheostomy the following day.
DISCUSSION: Kaposi sarcoma is a violaceous vascular neoplasm that is an acquired 
immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness. Mucocutaneous membranes
should be thoroughly evaluated with patients suspected of AIDS. This case
demonstrates the vital evaluation of the patient's airway to assess patency.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy should be initiated promptly, as well as
chemotherapy in severe systemic cases.
