Lactoferrins are an iron-binding glycoprotein that have important protective
roles in the mammalian body through their numerous functions, which include
antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant
activities. Among these, their antimicrobial activity has been the most studied, 
although the mechanism behind antimicrobial activities remains to be elucidated. 
Thirty years ago, the first lactoferrin-derived peptide was isolated and showed
higher antimicrobial activity than the native lactoferrin lactoferricin. Since
then, numerous studies have investigated the antimicrobial potencies of
lactoferrins, lactoferricins, and other lactoferrin-derived peptides to better
understand their antimicrobial activities at the molecular level. This review
defines the current antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic
activities of lactoferrins, lactoferricins, and lactoferrin-derived peptides. The
primary focus is on their different mechanisms of activity against bacteria,
viruses, fungi, and parasites. The role of their structure, amino-acid
composition, conformation, charge, hydrophobicity, and other factors that affect 
their mechanisms of antimicrobial activity are also reviewed.
