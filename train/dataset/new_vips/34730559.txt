INTRODUCTION: The impact of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus
(HCV) on burden of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has 
not been examined. We assessed recent trends in liver disease etiologies of HCC
and proportion of noncirrhotic HCC since DAAs introduction.
METHODS: Clinical characteristics including presence or absence of underlying
cirrhosis were collected from 2,623 patients diagnosed with HCC between 2009 and 
2019 at 2 large US centers. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the 
annual trends of HCC due to different liver diseases and proportions of
noncirrhotic cases.
RESULTS: In the DAA era (2014-2019), annual decline in HCV-HCC (odds ratio [OR] =
0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.99, P = 0.019), without change in
trends of other liver diseases-related HCC, was observed. Annual increase in
noncirrhotic HCC (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.23, P = 0.009) and decline in cirrhotic 
HCC (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.97, P = 0.009) along with similar trends for
HCV-HCC-increase in noncirrhotic cases (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P = 0.009) and
decrease in cirrhotic cases (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98, P = 0.012)-were observed 
during the DAA era. Compared with the pre-DAA era, HCC resection rate increased
(10.7% vs 14.0%, P = 0.013) whereas liver transplantation rate decreased (15.1%
vs 12.0%, P = 0.023) in the DAA era.
DISCUSSION: Since introduction of DAAs, proportions of cirrhotic HCC have
decreased, whereas proportions of noncirrhotic HCC have increased. These new
trends were associated with change in utilization of liver resection and
transplantation for HCC. The impact of changing patterns of DAA use on these
trends will require further study.
