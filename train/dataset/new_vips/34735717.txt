Pregnancy changes the body's immune system to counteract the spectrum of
infections, including COVID-19, which can pose complications. Pregnant women are 
less likely to contract COVID-19 infections than the general public. However,
pregnant women are at slightly increased risk of becoming severely unwell if they
do catch COVID-19, and congenital conditions in pregnant women may worsen the
state of infection and lead to critical stages and even mortality. The
possibility of vertical transmission has been reported in only a few cases of
COVID-19; however, it was not noted in cases of SARS and MERS. Vaccination
coverage in pregnant women remains a challenge. Children are the next suspected
and vulnerable population to acquire infection after the first and second waves. 
Children are disproportionately infected compared with older populations, but the
severity of infection is less compared to adults. This review highlights the
complexities of COVID-19 in pregnant women and the underlying reasons why
children tend to be comparatively less severely affected. Ethnicity, nutrition,
lifestyle, and therapeutics influence the severity of infection in children. Low 
expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, indigenous virus
competence, and maternal immunity is the first-line defense for children against 
COVID-19. Habituating herbal medicines from childhood may help support a robust
and defensive immune system to counteract novel antigens and encourage healthy
generations.
