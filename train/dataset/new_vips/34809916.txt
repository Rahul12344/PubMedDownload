It is important to recognize and treat human immunodeficiency virus-associated
pulmonary arterial hypertension (HIV-PAH) because of the associated morbidity and
mortality. With the introduction of antiretroviral therapies (ART), improved
survival has changed the focus of treatment management from
immunodeficiency-related opportunistic infections to chronic cardiovascular
complications, including HIV-PAH. The 2018 6th World Symposium of Pulmonary
Hypertension recommended a revised definition of PAH that might result in a
greater number of patients with HIV-PAH; however, the implication of this change 
is not yet clear. Here, we review the current literature on the diagnosis,
management, and outcomes of patients with HIV-PAH.
