Current Recommendations on Returning to Youth Sports After COVID-19 Infection.

Le HM, Stracciolini A.

Children represent a small fraction of total cumulative cases of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The potential health
consequences related to infection for children are not inconsequential. For
example, some may develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which is
commonly associated with cardiovascular involvement. Nevertheless, the short- and
long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unknown. In particular, the
impact on physical health and how it affects one's ability to return to physical 
activity are continuously evolving. As more youth sports organizations are
lifting restrictions, the volume of youth athletes will increase and the demand
for providing medical clearance will grow. This article aims to provide a review 
of return to physical activity guidelines for young athletes post-SARS-CoV-2
infection based on expert consensus statements and professional organization
recommendations. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(11):e461-e464.].
