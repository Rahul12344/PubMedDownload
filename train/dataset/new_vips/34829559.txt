To investigate the structure of Arthrospira platensis polysaccharide (PAP)
(intracellular polysaccharide) and the antioxidant activity of the first
component of PAP (PAP-1) on pseudorabies virus (PRV) -infected RAW264.7 cells.
The PAP was separated and purified by the Cellulose DE-52 chromatography column
and Sephacryl S-200 high-resolution gel column to obtain PAP-1. The antioxidant
activity and regulation of PAP-1 on PRV-infected RAW264.7 cells of
circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were investigated by chemical kit, Q-PCR, and ce-RNA
seq. The results indicated that the molecular weight (Mw) of PAP-1, which was
mainly composed of glucose and eight other monosaccharides, was 1.48 × 106 Da.
The main glycosidic bond structure of PAP-1 was →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1→. PAP-1 may be
increased the antioxidant capacity by regulating the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network
in PRV-infected RAW264.7 cells. This study provided a scientific foundation for
further exploring the antioxidant activity of PAP-1 based on its structure.
