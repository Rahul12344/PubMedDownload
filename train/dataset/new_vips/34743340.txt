BACKGROUND & AIMS: CD8 T cells are essential in controlling Hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection. Viral control is dependent on efficient recognition of
HBV-infected hepatocytes by CD8 T cells, which can induce direct lysis of
infected hepatocytes. In addition, CD8 T cells produce IFN-γ, which mediates
non-cytopathic viral clearance. Innate immunomodulators and HBV-targeted RNA
interference (RNAi) are being developed to treat chronic hepatitis B, but may
modify HBV antigen presentation and impact CD8 T cell recognition, in addition to
their primary mechanisms of action.
APPROACH & RESULTS: HBV infected HepG2-NTCP were treated with tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonists, TLR7/8
conditioned media (CM) collected from immune cells, or RNAi using
short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The effect of these treatments on antigen
presentation was measured through co-culture with CD8 T cells recognizing
HLA-A0201 restricted epitopes, HBc18-27 or HBs183-191. Cytokine profiles of
TLR7/8 CM was measured using cytometric bead array. TDF reduced viral
replication, but not CD8 T cell recognition of infected cells. Direct exposure of
infected HepG2-NTCP to TLR7/8 agonists had no impact on T cell recognition.
Exposure of infected HepG2-NTCP to TLR7/8 CM enhanced HBV-specific CD8 T cell
recognition through type 1 interferon (IFN) and IFN-γ dependent mechanisms. RNAi 
rapidly suppressed HBV DNA, HBV Core antigen (HBcAg), and HBV S antigen (HBsAg)
expression, impairing recognition by HBV-specific CD8 T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulation, and RNAi, but not nucleos(t)ide analogues, alter
recognition of infected HepG2-NTCP by HBV-specific CD8 T cells. Understanding
these changes will inform combination treatments for CHB.
