In June 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases 
surged in Liberia. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from patients hospitalized during
March-July 2021 revealed the Delta variant was in Liberia in early March and was 
dominant in June, irrespective of geography. Mutations and deletions suggest
multiple SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant introductions.
