Purpose: To present to and inform the practitioner of an unusual presentation of 
Varicella zoster virus and Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome.
Observations: A 69-year-old bedbound male with vascular dementia presented to the
emergency room with a red right eye with associated tearing and mucus production.
The patient could not express if he was in pain. The initial diagnosis from the
emergency room was bacterial keratitis, confirmed with a positive pseudomonas
culture. However, upon examination by the ophthalmologist it was noted that there
was not only a large, infected epithelial defect, but also an intraocular
pressure of 35 and a candy-cane hypopyon. The diagnosis of herpes neurotrophic
keratitis and iridocyclitis was made and the patient was started on intravenous
acyclovir along with the appropriate topical medications. A day later, it was
noted that the patient developed a right sided facial palsy and vesicular lesions
inside the right ear canal, as confirmed by otolaryngology.
Conclusion and Importance: Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome is usually known to the
ophthalmologist due to the exposure keratopathy caused by facial palsy. This case
demonstrates varicella-zoster virus (VZV) neurotrophic keratitis preceding the
development of facial palsy, which can further exacerbate an already neurotrophic
cornea. The practitioner should be aware of these signs and symptoms and adjust
their treatment with systemic acyclovir-prednisone.
