AIM: The global burden of chronic liver disease is substantial. Limited studies
have reported the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver
disease (MAFLD) and liver fibrosis among middle-aged and older people. Therefore,
we aimed to determine the nationwide prevalence of and associated factors for
MAFLD and fibrosis in adults aged 45-79 years from the United States.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2017-2018 cycle of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted with a nationally
representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.
Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were assessed by transient elastography with
controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 1186 eligible participants aged 45-79 years were finally
included in the analyses. The estimated prevalence of MAFLD, significant fibrosis
(F ≥ F2), and advanced fibrosis (F ≥ F3) was 48.6% (95% confidence interval [CI],
43.1%-54.0%), 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-12.7%), and 6.7% (95% CI, 4.1%-10.1%),
respectively. Multivariable logistic regression revealed an increased MAFLD
predisposition in subjects with metabolic disorders including overweight/obesity,
abdominal obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the presence of
depression was an independent and strong predictor of MAFLD risk (odds
ratio = 3.23; 95% CI, 1.37-7.11). Elevated liver enzymes, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, hepatitis virus infection, and steatosis were associated with a high
risk of significant fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Newly defined MAFLD is highly prevalent in the US middle-aged and
older population. Approximately 1 in 10 people has significant liver fibrosis. In
addition to metabolic disorders, the presence of depression potentially increases
the risk of MAFLD.
