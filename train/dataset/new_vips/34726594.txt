Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses cause devastating outbreaks in
farmed poultry with serious consequences for animal welfare and economic losses. 
Zoonotic infection of humans through close contact with H5N1 infected birds is
often severe and fatal. England experienced an outbreak of H5N1 in turkeys in
1991 that led to thousands of farmed bird mortalities. Isolation of clonal
populations of one such virus from this outbreak uncovered amino acid differences
in the virus haemagglutinin (HA) gene whereby the different genotypes could be
associated with distinct pathogenic outcomes in chickens; both low pathogenic
(LP) and high pathogenic (HP) phenotypes could be observed despite all containing
a multi-basic cleavage site (MBCS) in the HA gene. Using reverse genetics, three 
amino acid substitutions in HA were examined for their ability to affect
pathogenesis in the chicken. Restoration of amino acid polymorphisms close to the
receptor binding site that are commonly found in H5 viruses only partially
improved viral fitness in vitro and in vivo. A third novel substitution in the
fusion peptide, HA2G4R, enabled the HP phenotype. HA2G4R decreased the pH
stability of HA and increased the pH of HA fusion. The substitutions close to the
receptor binding site optimised receptor binding while modulating the pH of HA
fusion. Importantly, this study revealed pathogenic determinants beyond the MBCS.
