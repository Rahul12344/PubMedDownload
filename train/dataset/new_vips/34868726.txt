Background: Novel messenger RNA vaccines against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been vital in resolving the coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Detection of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)
against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) confirms immunogenicity with high
sensitivity and specificity. Few recent studies with primary and secondary
immunodeficient cohorts present adequate or reduced antibody response. We
describe the first reported successful response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody
post-vaccination in magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) gene deficiency, more
commonly recognized as x-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect,
Epstein-Barr Virus infection, and neoplasia (XMEN).
Case Presentation: We present a 30-year-old male with selective
anti-polysaccharide antibody deficiency, peripheral blood
CD5  +  /CD19  +  B-cell predominance (97%), MAGT1 mutation, and reduced
CD16  +  CD56  +  natural killer- and/or CD8  +  T-cell receptor, Group 2, Member
D expression. His initial immunological evaluation revealed all seronegative
post-vaccination antibody titers but clinically adequate response to protein
antigens tetanus and diphtheria anti-toxoids.COVID-19 vaccination and associated 
serology antibody testing was recommended at this office visit. Anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies before and after the first BNT162b2 mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as nucleocapsid antibody, were negative. S
protein total antibody was reactive after the second dose.
Discussion: Robust immunological sequelae post-COVID-19 vaccination in the
general population are well-documented in the recent literature. Few studies have
evaluated COVID-19 vaccination antibody response in immunodeficient patients. The
majority positive anti-S antibody detection in most primary immunodeficient (PID)
patients among the few studies in the literature, such as the present case,
support the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in immunodeficient
patients, although larger scale studies are needed.
Conclusion: We demonstrate successful vaccination in the PID MAGT1 deficiency in 
this first reported case of reactive anti-S antibody post-COVID-19 vaccination.
