The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments is a cause of increasing
concern. In this study, three sampling methodologies have been used in order to
collect SARS-CoV-2 and 17 other respiratory viruses in indoor air, combined with 
a new analytical process to analyze respiratory viruses. Different areas of an
ophthalmological hospital were investigated for the presence of these airborne
viruses. Moreover, indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters (carbon dioxide, CO2;
carbon monoxide, CO; nitrogen dioxide, NO2; volatile organic compounds, VOCs;
formaldehyde, HCHO; and particulate matter, PM) have been examined to study the
relationship between IAQ and airborne viruses. All indoor air and surface samples
assessed were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, another airborne
respiratory virus (HRV/ENV) was detected, illustrating that the methodology set
out here is a suitable one. Regarding the results for the IAQ, chemical
parameters studied in the hall and waiting room of the hospital presented
acceptable values. However, in the doctor's consultation room VOCs and HCHO show 
some instantaneous levels higher than the recommended guide values. The
methodological approach described in this paper, integrating conventional IAQ and
the assessment of bioaerosols, can be used in research and control programs aimed
at promoting a healthy indoor environment.
