A 70-year-old man was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pneumonia. Twenty-six days after admission, he experienced hematemesis despite
improvement in his respiratory symptoms. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography
revealed edematous stomach wall thickening with neither ischemic findings in the 
gastric wall nor obstruction of the gastric artery. Emergent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse dark-red mucosa accompanied by multiple
easy-bleeding, irregularly shaped ulcers throughout almost the whole stomach
without active bleeding or visible vessels. The clinical course, including the
endoscopic findings, progressed favorably with conservative treatment. COVID-19
pneumonia can present with acute gastric mucosal lesion, which may be induced by 
microvascular thrombosis due to COVID-19-related coagulopathy.
