SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that is the cause of COVID-19 pandemic. To enter 
the cell, the virus interacts via its surface S protein with
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main entry receptor on the cell
membrane. Most of protective antibodies, including those induced by vaccinations,
target the S protein, preventing its interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We have 
evaluated an alternative strategy for blocking the S-ACE2 interaction using new
antipeptide antibodies to the N-terminus of the ACE2 molecule. These antibodies
allow detection of human ACE2 in vitro and ex vivo.
