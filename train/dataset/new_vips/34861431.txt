Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), which belongs to the Potyvirus genus of the family
Potyviridae, causes mosaic diseases in canna, sugarcane and maize worldwide.
Previously, the genetic variations, timescale, codon usage patterns and host
adaptions of SCMV were determined. However, the dinucleotide composition and the 
dinucleotide bias from hosts or the protein coding regions of the virus have yet 
to be investigated. In this study, comprehensive analyses of the dinucleotide
composition and dinucleotide bias from hosts, lineages and protein coding regions
of SCMV were performed using 131 complete genomic sequences. We found that UpG
and CpA were largely overrepresented while UpA, CpC, and CpG were largely
underrepresented in the polyprotein and 11 protein coding region data sets. SCMV 
dinucleotide composition bias is more strongly dependent on the protein coding
regions than on hosts. A weak association between the dinucleotide composition
and SCMV lineages was also observed. Our analysis provides a novel perspective on
the molecular evolutionary mechanisms of SCMV and may provide a better
understanding of future research on the origin and evolutionary patterns of SCMV.
