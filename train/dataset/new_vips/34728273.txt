The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belonging to the
family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus, has been recognized as a highly
pathogenic virus. Due to the lack of therapeutic or preventive agents against
MERS-CoV, developing an effective vaccine is essential for preventing a viral
outbreak. To address this, we developed a recombinant S1 subunit of MERS-CoV
spike protein fused with the human IgG4 Fc fragment (LV-MS1-Fc) in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Thereafter, we identified the baculovirus gp64 signal 
peptide-directed secretion of LV-MS1-Fc protein in the extracellular fluid. To
demonstrate the immunogenicity of the recombinant LV-MS1-Fc proteins, BALB/c mice
were inoculated with 2.5 μg of LV-MS1-Fc. The inoculated mice demonstrated a
significant humoral immune response, measured via total IgG and neutralizing
antibodies. In addition, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) transgenic mice
vaccinated with LV-MS1-Fc showed the protective capacity of LV-MS1-Fc against
MERS-CoV with no inflammatory cell infiltration. These data showed that the S1
and Fc fusion protein induced potent humoral immunity and antigen-specific
neutralizing antibodies in mice, and conferred protection against coronavirus
viral challenge, indicating that LV-MS1-Fc is an effective vaccine candidate
against MERS-CoV infection.
