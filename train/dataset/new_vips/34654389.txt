BACKGROUND: The first wave of the COVID-19-pandemic hit different countries with 
varying degrees of severity, so that differences in the type and level of
emergency measures were also necessary. It can be assumed that the psychological 
burden was higher in countries subjected to a more severe course of the pandemic 
(Italy) than in countries subjected to a less severe one (Germany, Austria).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate and contrast the wellbeing of the population in Italy, 
Austria, and Germany in the early phase of the first lockdown.
METHOD: Online survey on N = 4289 individuals. The questionnaire comprised a
self-administered section, exploring the dimensions: perceived severity of
COVID-19, perceived risk of disease, concerns related to COVID-19, emergency
measure acceptance and emotional distress due to emergency measures; and
standardized scales to record emotional state and coping: Stress-Coping-Style
Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule,
State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory.
RESULTS: The three countries displayed significant differences in all
investigated dimensions (p < .001). Italian participants assessed the COVID-19
virus as much more dangerous (p < .001), but despite the prevalence of the virus,
the subjective risk of disease was perceived to be lower in Italy (p < .001).
This could be a positive effect of the restrictive curfews set by the government 
in Italy. The emergency measures were generally perceived to be very effective in
all three countries, but due to the duration and the severity of the measures,
the fear and stress-reaction were the strongest among Italian participants
(p < .001).
CONCLUSION: The stricter measures in Italy prevented an application of many
positive stress processing strategies, which, in turn, fostered the perpetuation 
of stresses and fear.
