SARS-CoV-2 replication requires the synthesis of a set of structural proteins
expressed through discontinuous transcription of ten subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). 
Here, we have fine-tuned droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays to accurately detect 
and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genomic ORF1ab and sgmRNAs for the nucleocapsid (N) and
spike (S) proteins. We analyzed 166 RNA samples from anonymized SARS-CoV-2
positive subjects and we observed a recurrent and characteristic pattern of
sgmRNAs expression in relation to the total viral RNA content. Additionally,
expression profiles of sgmRNAs, as determined by meta-transcriptomics sequencing 
of a subset of 110 RNA samples, were highly correlated with those obtained by
ddPCR. By providing a comprehensive and dynamic snapshot of the levels of
SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNAs in infected individuals, our results may contribute a better
understanding of the dynamics of transcription and expression of the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate the development of more accurate molecular diagnostic
tools for the stratification of COVID-19 patients.
