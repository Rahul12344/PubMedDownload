Carbon monoxide (CO), a byproduct of heme catalyzed by heme oxygenase (HO), has
been reported to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, and to produce 
significant neuroprotective effects. The potential effects of CO and even HO on
depressive-like behaviors are still poorly understood. Utilizing several
approaches including adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of
HO-1, systemic CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), CO-rich saline or CO gas
treatment procedures in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced PC12
cell injury model, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mouse model,
the present study aimed to investigate the potential antidepressant- and
anxiolytic-like effects of endogenous and exogenous CO administration in vivo and
in vitro. The results of in vitro experiments showed that both CO-RM-3 and
CO-RM-A1 pretreatment blocked H2O2-induced cellular injuries by increasing cell
survival and decreasing cell apoptosis and necrosis. Similar to the effects of
CO-RM-3 and CO-RM-A1 pretreatment, AAV-mediated HO-1 overexpression in the dorsal
hippocampus produced significant antidepressant-like activities in mice under
normal conditions. Further investigation showed that the CO gas treatment
significantly blocked LPS-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice.
Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of HO-1 and/or exogenous 
CO administration produces protective effects and exerts antidepressant- and
anxiolytic-like effects. These data uncover a novel function of the HO-1/CO
system that appears to be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of
depression and anxiety.
