BACKGROUND: Understanding patterns of environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2
is essential for infection prevention policies.
METHODS: We screened surfaces and air samples from single bed ICU rooms of
COVID-19 adult patients for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable viruses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We evidenced viral RNA environmental contamination in 76%
of 100 surfaces samples and in 30% of 40 air samples without any viable virus
detection by cell culture assays. No significant differences of viral RNA levels 
on surfaces and in ambient air were observed between rooms of patients with
assisted mechanical ventilation and those of patients with high-flow nasal
cannula system. Using an original experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection model of
surfaces, we assessed that infectious viruses might have been present on benches 
within 15 hours before the time of sampling in patient rooms.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination around
COVID-19 patients hospitalized in single ICU rooms was extensive and that a
high-flow nasal cannula system did not generate more viral aerosolization than a 
mechanical ventilation system in COVID-19 patients. Despite an absence of
SARS-CoV-2 viable particles in study samples, our experimental model confirmed
the need to apply strict environmental disinfection procedures and classical
standard and droplet precautions in ICU wards.
