Better methods to predict and prevent the emergence of zoonotic viruses could
support future efforts to reduce the risk of epidemics. We propose a network
science framework for understanding and predicting human and animal
susceptibility to viral infections. Related approaches have so far helped to
identify basic biological rules that govern cross-species transmission and
structure the global virome. We highlight ways to make modelling both accurate
and actionable, and discuss the barriers that prevent researchers from
translating viral ecology into public health policies that could prevent future
pandemics.
