Determining SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity is crucial for patient clinical
assessment and isolation decisions. We assessed subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) as a
surrogate marker of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR
respiratory samples (n=105) by comparison with viral culture as the reference
standard for virus replication. sgRNA and viral isolation results were concordant
in 99/105 cases (94%) indicating highly significant agreement between the two
techniques (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.97, p<0.001). sgRNA
RT-PCR showed a sensitivity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 94% to
detect replication-competent virus, further supporting sgRNA as a surrogate
marker of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. sgRNA RT-PCR is an accurate, rapid and
affordable technique that can overcome culture and Ct value limitations and can
be routinely implemented in hospital laboratories to detect viral infectivity,
which is essential to optimize patient monitoring, the efficacy of
treatments/vaccines, work reincorporation policies and for safely shortening
isolation precautions.
