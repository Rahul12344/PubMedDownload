Introduction: Ocular complaints are considered non-classical presentations for
COVID-19 infection; the initial diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis is even rarer. 
Indeed, this puts treating clinicians in danger of getting infected, especially
when patients present without the classic respiratory symptoms.
Case: Here we report a case of COVID-19 that was initially presented with
keratoconjunctivitis with the appearance of respiratory symptoms four days later.
The case showed improvement within four days of successful treatment for both
covid pneumonia and ocular disease.
Discussion: Countable cases reported initial ocular symptoms to co-occur with
systemic symptoms or even before. Only two cases reported the diagnosis of
keratoconjunctivitis in COVID-19. The two cases differ in the proposed mechanism 
of developing such disorder. One by direct invasion of the virus, the other one
by cytokines-induced epithelial injury. Our case did not show positivity for
SARS-CoV 2 in the eye secretion, which aligns with the later proposed mechanism
of pathology.
Conclusion: It is crucial to report such cases to increase the awareness of
atypical presentation for COVID-19 infection. This is too important for two
reasons: first, to diagnose the disease itself, and second, to take infection
control precautions when treating such cases, with unexpected initial
presentation.
