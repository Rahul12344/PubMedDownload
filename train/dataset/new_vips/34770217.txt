COVID-19 has had a severe impact on human health, as well as in social and
economic terms, with implications for the management and governance of the water 
and sanitation sector. These implications are evident in Latin America and the
Caribbean due to existing challenges the region faces in accessing water and
sanitation services. In spite of significant advances, around 65 million people
in the LAC region currently lack appropriate access to water and soap to wash
their hands-one of the most basic measures to prevent the spread of disease.
Furthermore, social and economic vulnerabilities have exacerbated the effects of 
the pandemic in the region, particularly among those living in poverty. The
COVID-19 pandemic thus requires the mobilization of frameworks such as the human 
rights to water and sanitation, specifically considering the region's realities. 
This paper provides a review of some of the challenges currently faced in the
region and advances a series of recommendations for enhancing access to water,
sanitation and hygiene. The importance of effective governance, management and
communication strategies in the water provisioning sector is highlighted in the
context of the pandemic, and the role of science and research for adequate
decision making is emphasized.
