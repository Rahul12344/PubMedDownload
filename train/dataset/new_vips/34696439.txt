Biosafety, biosecurity, logistical, political, and technical considerations can
delay or prevent the wide dissemination of source material containing viable
virus from the geographic origin of an outbreak to laboratories involved in
developing medical countermeasures (MCMs). However, once virus genome sequence
information is available from clinical samples, reverse-genetics systems can be
used to generate virus stocks de novo to initiate MCM development. In this study,
we developed a reverse-genetics system for natural isolates of Ebola virus (EBOV)
variants Makona, Tumba, and Ituri, which have been challenging to obtain. These
systems were generated starting solely with in silico genome sequence information
and have been used successfully to produce recombinant stocks of each of the
viruses for use in MCM testing. The antiviral activity of MCMs targeting viral
entry varied depending on the recombinant virus isolate used. Collectively,
selecting and synthetically engineering emerging EBOV variants and demonstrating 
their efficacy against available MCMs will be crucial for answering pressing
public health and biosecurity concerns during Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreaks.
