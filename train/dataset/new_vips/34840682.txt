Purpose: To quantify the microvasculature density of the optic nerve head (ONH)
using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis in patients
recovered from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients
recovered from COVID-19 whose initial diagnosis was confirmed by a rRT-PCR of a
nasopharyngeal sample were included in this study. OCTA of ONH was performed in
included patients and normal controls. Vascular density (VD) of the all vessels
(AV) and small vessels (SV) inside the disc and radial peripapillary capillary
(RPC) network density were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients and compared
with similar parameters in an age-matched group of normal controls.
Results: Twenty-five COVID-19 patients and twenty-two age-matched normal controls
were enrolled in the study and one eye per participant was evaluated. The mean
whole image SV VD in the COVID-19 group (49.31 ± 1.93) was not statistically
significantly different from that in the control group (49.94 ± . 2.22; P =
0.308). A decrease in RPC VD was found in all AV and SV VD measured, which became
statistically significant in whole peripapillary SV VD, peripapillary inferior
nasal SV VD, peripapillary inferior temporal SV VD, peripapillary superior nasal 
SV VD, and grid-based AV VD inferior sector (P < 0.05). Inside disc SV VD in the 
COVID-19 group (49.43 ± 4.96) was higher than in the control group (45.46 ± 6.22)
which was statistically significant (P = 0.021).
Conclusion: Unremarkable decrease was found in ONH microvasculature in patients
who had recovered from COVID-19. These patients may be at risk of ONH vascular
complications. Increase in inner disc SV VD may be an indicator of ONH hyperemia 
and edema.
