Background: Type 2 diabetes is a well described extra-hepatic manifestation of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to explore the potential
mechanism of KCNQ1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) in type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) caused by HCV infection.
Methods: Min6 cells were infected with HCV to establish a vitro model, and the
HCV copy number was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The mRNA
and protein expressions of IL-1β, IL-18, NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD were
analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to
evaluate the pyroptosis of cells and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
detected the secretion of insulin. A dual luciferase reporter gene assay then
verified the targeting relationship of KCNQ1OT1, miRNA-223-3p, and NLRP3.
Results: KCNQ1OT1 was highly expressed in HCV-infected T2DM patients and
HCV-infected β-cells. Silencing KCNQ1OT1 inhibited β-cell pyroptosis by
regulating miR-223-3p/NLRP3, and inhibition of miR-223-3p or overexpression of
NLRP3 reversed the pyroptosis by silencing KCNQ1OT1.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate KCNQ1OT1 promotes HCV-infected β-cell
pyroptosis through the miRNA-223-3p/NLRP3 axis, effecting the production of
insulin and accelerating the occurrence and development of T2DM.Regulating
KCNQ1OT1 and its target genes will help to better understand the pathogenesis of 
T2DM induced by HCV infection and provide new theoretical foundations and
therapeutic targets.
