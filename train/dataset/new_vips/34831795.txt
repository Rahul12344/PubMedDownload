The limitations caused by the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus have had
repercussions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy. During the pandemic,
Italy issued updated guidelines regarding voluntary termination of pregnancy by
means of mifepristone and prostaglandin. This included news concerning the time
limit and location in which this procedure could be accessed: updates partially
recognize women's needs, and they are into line with the European parliament's
recent exhortations. However, these updates do not change the previously provided
responsibilities that lie with doctors. This article aimed to compare regulations
concerning medical abortion in Italy and other countries, with a focus on recent 
Italian updates in the context of pandemic.
