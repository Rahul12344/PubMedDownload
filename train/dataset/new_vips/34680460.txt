Understanding immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 is essential for coping with
the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we discuss experiences and open questions about
the complex immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Some people react excellently without
experiencing any clinical symptoms, they do not get sick, and they do not pass
the virus on to anyone else ("sterilizing" immunity). Others produce antibodies
and do not get COVID-19 but transmit the virus to others ("protective" immunity).
Some people get sick but recover. A varying percentage develops respiratory
failure, systemic symptoms, clotting disorders, cytokine storms, or multi-organ
failure; they subsequently decease. Some develop long COVID, a new pathologic
entity similar to fatigue syndrome or autoimmunity. In reality, COVID-19 is
considered more of a systemic immune-vascular disease than a pulmonic disease,
involving many tissues and the central nervous system. To fully comprehend the
complex clinical manifestations, a profound understanding of the immune responses
to SARS-CoV-2 is a good way to improve clinical management of COVID-19. Although 
neutralizing antibodies are an established approach to recognize an immune
status, cellular immunity plays at least an equivalent or an even more important 
role. However, reliable methods to estimate the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
capacity are not available for clinical routines. This deficit is important
because an unknown percentage of people may exist with good memory T cell
responsibility but a low number of or completely lacking peripheral antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2. Apart from natural immune responses, vaccination against
SARS-CoV-2 turned out to be very effective and much safer than naturally acquired
immunity. Nevertheless, besides unwanted side effects of the currently available 
vector and mRNA preparations, concerns remain whether these vaccines will be
strong enough to defeat the pandemic. Altogether, herein we discuss important
questions, and try to give answers based on the current knowledge and preliminary
data from our laboratories.
