Vitamin D and zinc are important components of nutritional immunity. This study
compared the serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and zinc in
COVID-19 outpatients with those of potentially non-infected participants. The
association of clinical symptoms with vitamin D and zinc status was also
examined. A checklist and laboratory examination were applied to collect data in 
a cross-sectional study conducted on 53 infected outpatients with COVID-19 and 53
potentially non-infected participants. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D were not
significantly lower in patients with moderate illness (19 ± 12 ng/mL) than
patients with asymptomatic or mild illness (29 ± 18 ng/mL), with a trend noted
for a lower serum concentration of 25(OH)D in moderate than asymptomatic or mild 
illness patients (p = 0.054). Infected patients (101 ± 18 µg/dL) showed a lower
serum concentration of zinc than potentially non-infected participants (114 ± 13 
µg/dL) (p = 0.01). Patients with normal (odds ratio (OR), 0.19; p ≤ 0.001) and
insufficient (OR, 0.3; p = 0.007) vitamin D status at the second to seventh days 
of disease had decreased OR of general symptoms compared to patients with vitamin
D deficiency. This study revealed the importance of 25(OH)D measurement to
predict the progression of general and pulmonary symptoms and showed that
infected patients had significantly lower zinc concentrations than potentially
non-infected participants.
