BACKGROUND: H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) infect avian and mammalian hosts 
and provide internal genes for new emerging highly pathogenic avian viruses that 
cause severe pneumonia with high mortality, for which few medications are
available. Arctiin, a bioactive lignan glycoside, has been reported to possess
multiple pharmacological properties. However, the effect of arctiin on H9N2 virus
infection is unclear. In the current study, we analyzed the effect of arctiin on 
H9N2 virus infection and the underlying molecular mechanism in vitro.
METHODS: The antiviral effect against H9N2 virus was determined by plaque
reduction assay (PRA) and progeny virus reduction assay. We employed MTT assay,
qRT-PCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence and Western blotting to better understand the 
anti-inflammatory effect and corresponding mechanism of arctiin on H9N2
virus-infected cells.
RESULTS: The results showed that arctiin had antiviral activity against H9N2
virus. Arctiin treatment reduced H9N2 virus-triggered proinflammatory cytokines, 
such as IL-6, and TNF-α. Moreover, arctiin significantly suppressed H9N2
virus-mediated expression of COX-2 and PGE2. Furthermore, we found that arctiin
inhibited H9N2 virus-mediated activation of RIG-I/JNK MAPK signaling.
Interestingly, arctiin treatment obviously reversed H9N2 virus-induced reduction 
of Nrf2, increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and upregulated Nrf2
signaling target genes (HO-1 and SOD2). Zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp)-an HO-1
inhibitor-weakened the inhibitory effect of arctiin on H9N2 virus-induced
RIG-I/JNK MAPK and proinflammatory mediators.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggested that the anti-inflammatory
effects of arctiin on H9N2 virus infection may be due to the activation of
Nrf2/HO-1 and blocked RIG-I/JNK MAPK signaling; thus, arctiin may be a promising 
agent for prevention and treatment of H9N2 virus infections.
