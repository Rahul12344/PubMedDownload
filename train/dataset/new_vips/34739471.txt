BACKGROUND AND AIM: In early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the WHO 
and Italy was one of the first and most severely affected country in Europe.
Despite the global interest about COVID-19 pandemic, several aspects of this
infection are still unclear, especially in pediatric population. This study aims 
to investigate the characteristics of the isolated or quarantined children and
adolescents followed by the Public Health Department of the Italian province of
Modena during the first wave of COVID-19.
METHODS: The study population included all non-adult subjects aged 0-18 years who
underwent isolation or quarantine during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
from February 24 to June 18, 2020 in Modena province, Northern Italy.
RESULTS: In Modena province, 1230 children and adolescents were isolated in case 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6.3%), or quarantined due to close contact with
confirmed cases (88.7%) or travelling from a high-risk area (5.0%). Among 349
individuals who underwent swab testing, 294 (84.2%) reported close contact with
an infected cohabiting relative and 158 (45.3%) were symptomatic. Among all
tested subjects, 78 (22.4%) resulted positive, with a higher proportion of
symptomatic subjects compared with the SARS-CoV-2-negative (78.2% vs. 35.8%).
Fever was mostly present in SARS-CoV-2-positive children (48.7% vs. 12.6%). Both 
anosmia (58.3% vs. 41.7%) and dysgeusia (54.5% vs. 45.5%) had only slightly
higher frequency in SARS-CoV-2-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings allow to expand the knowledge regarding
characteristics of non-adult subjects isolated or quarantined during the first
wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. (www.actabiomedica.it).
