Background: Neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from positive mothers to their
babies has been a real concern, opening the arena of research in this area.
Objective: To detect the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from 
COVID-19-positive mothers to their neonates and the clinicopathological outcome
in them.
Design: A single-centre, prospective, observational study involving 47
COVID-19-positive mothers and their neonates.
Setting: A tertiary care hospital in Eastern India.
Participants: Neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers.
Main outcome measures: We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate by
real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) done twice (on admission and after
24 hours of admission) in neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers, who
tested RT-PCR positive for this virus in their nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical
outcome was also assessed in these neonates during their hospital stay.
Results: Out of 47 neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers, four were
SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR. All the neonates in our study were discharged home
in stable condition after management of acute complications. None of them
required readmission.
Conclusion: Vertical transmission occurs in neonates born to COVID-19-positive
mothers; however, the risk is small. Majority of the neonates remain asymptomatic
with good clinical outcome.
