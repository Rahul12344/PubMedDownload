The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response;
however, the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly
understood. Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major
structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently
induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1b, TNFa, CXCL1,
CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such
inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human
and mouse lung epithelial cells also produced inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly 
were non-inflammatory, but elicited an inflammatory response in macrophages when 
co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation
via activation of the NF-kB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an
activation of the NF-kB pathway was abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages.
Consistently, administration of S protein induced IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b in
wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Notably, upon recognition of S protein,
TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to activate the NF-kB pathway. Together these
data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and
suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.
