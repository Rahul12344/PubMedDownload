The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the worst health crisis of our time and the 
greatest challenge we are facing since World War II. It has caused a negative
impact on engineering and construction industry, and huge uncertainty about the
ability to anticipate a planned recovery for the industry. Waiting for an
effective recovery that may take a long time, science has to provide solutions to
coexist with this virus and resume the work on construction sites. In fact, it is
not the first time that health and safety science deals with such a risk of
infection, as many guidelines treat the manner to reduce the risk of infection to
at-risk employees in construction, renovation, installation, and maintenance
activities. This article aims to perform an infection risk analysis, taking into 
consideration COVID-19 particularities, and to identify control measures to
ensure COVID-19 infection prevention and management on site. The study will be
based on a probabilistic approach using the Fault Tree Analysis method.
