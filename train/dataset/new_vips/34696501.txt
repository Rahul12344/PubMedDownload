The gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been nucleic acid
amplification tests (NAAT). However, rapid antigen detection kits (Ag-RDTs), may 
offer advantages over NAAT in mass screening, generating results in minutes, both
as laboratory-based test or point-of-care (POC) use for clinicians, at a lower
cost. We assessed two different POC Ag-RDTs in mass screening versus NAAT for
SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of pediatric patients admitted to the Pediatric Emergency 
Unit of IRCCS-Polyclinic of Sant'Orsola, Bologna (from November 2020 to April
2021). All patients were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of 
SARS-CoV-2-RNA and for antigen tests. Results were obtained from 1146 patients.
The COVID-19 Ag FIA kit showed a baseline sensitivity of 53.8% (CI 35.4-71.4%),
baseline specificity 99.7% (CI 98.4-100%) and overall accuracy of 80% (95% CI
0.68-0.91); the AFIAS COVID-19 Ag kit, baseline sensitivity of 86.4% (CI
75.0-93.9%), baseline specificity 98.3% (CI 97.1-99.1%) and overall accuracy of
95.3% (95% CI 0.92-0.99). In both tests, some samples showed very low viral load 
and negative Ag-RDT. This disagreement may reflect the positive inability of
Ag-RDTs of detecting antigen in late phase of infection. Among all cases with
positive molecular test and negative antigen test, none showed viral loads > 106 
copies/mL. Finally, we found one false Ag-RDTs negative result (low cycle
thresholds; 9 Ã— 105 copies/mL). Our results suggest that both Ag-RDTs showed good
performances in detection of high viral load samples, making it a feasible and
effective tool for mass screening in actively infected children.
