INTRODUCTION: This expert review outlines current and future point-of-care
technologies for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for 
causing coronavirus disease COVID-19 in the emergency department. COVID-19 first 
emerged in late 2019 and is responsible for a range of presentations from minor
upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia and multisystem organ
failure. Among the technologies available include the gold standard of molecular 
point-of-care tests as well as antigen detection tests.
AREAS COVERED: We discuss point-of-care molecular tests including multiplex,
targeted, and single plex panels as well as various antigen testing methodologies
in terms of availability and performance characteristics. In addition, we focus
on current testing best practices and considerations for point-of-care testing in
the emergency department based on a search of the literature available in PubMed 
to date and a review of FDA and CDC guidance.
EXPERT OPINION: While there have been many advances in SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care
testing, there remain challenges to implementation in the emergency department
setting. A paradigm shift is needed to improve diagnosis and clinical outcomes.
