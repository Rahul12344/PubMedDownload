Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes
the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The disease has caused more than
5.1 million deaths worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are
frequently the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that
COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the
direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys,
which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood.
Method: In this study, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney
glomerular podocytes. We studied uptake of the live SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as
pseudotyped viral particles by human iPS cell derived podocytes using qPCR,
western blot, and immunofluorescence. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses
revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes
(including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33)
associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing.
Result: Infection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped
lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of
Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence
studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS
cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot
process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular
diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe
COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified
BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human 
iPS cell-derived podocytes.
Conclusion: These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular
podocytes in vitro . These results also show that the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 by
kidney podocytes occurs via multiple binding interactions and partners, which may
underlie the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney tissues. This stem
cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug
screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.
Significant statement: Many patients with COVID19 disease exhibit multiorgan
complications, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can extend beyond the
respiratory system. Acute kidney injury is a common COVID-19 complication
contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Still, SARS-Cov-2 affinity for
specialized kidney cells remain less clear. By leveraging our protocol for stem
cell differentiation, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney
glomerular podocytes by using multiple Spike-binding proteins including ACE2 and 
BSG/CD147. Our results also indicate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause
podocyte cell death and foot process effacement, a hallmark of podocytopathies
including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19
disease. This stem cell-derived model is potentially useful for kidney-specific
antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.
