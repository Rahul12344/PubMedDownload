The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought fundamental changes in the US workplace,
placing employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) in disarray. Before the
pandemic, ESI was the single largest share of private health insurance in the
country, including some 150 million Americans. Even before the pandemic, however,
ESI had become increasingly volatile and more unaffordable for both employers and
employees. During the pandemic, many workers found that they could work at home
remotely. Job losses during the pandemic left many millions uninsured, with many 
jobs lost indefinitely. Today, many Americans are rethinking how and where they
want to be involved in the workplace, while many businesses are considering a
future when more people are working from home or being replaced by robots,
placing ESI in further jeopardy. This article brings historical perspective to
these problems, showing how the private health insurance industry has failed the 
public interest by being too fragmented and unreliable to be afforded or depended
upon. Three major reform alternatives are described, only 1 of which-single-payer
improved Medicare for All-can provide stable universal coverage that meets the
needs of all Americans while being affordable for patients, families, and
taxpayers.
