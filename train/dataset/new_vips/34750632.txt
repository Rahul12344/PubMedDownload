BACKGROUND: Due to an ageing population, dengue among older patients is
encountered more frequently in many countries. Our study aimed to explore the
clinico-laboratory parameters and outcomes among dengue-infected older patients
in comparison with younger patients.
METHODS: This retrospective chart review involved dengue patients with dengue
non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen positivity admitted to a tertiary hospital
in Malaysia from January to July 2015. A comparison was made between older people
(aged ≥60 y) and others.
RESULTS: Among 406 dengue patients, 43 (10.6%) were older people. Older dengue
patients were less likely to present with persistent vomiting (adjusted OR [AOR] 
0.247, 95% CI 0.093 to 0.656, p=0.005), while restlessness and confusion were
more common at presentation (AOR 3.356, 95% CI 1.024 to 11.003, p=0.046). Older
patients had significantly lower albumin upon admission (38 vs 40 g/L, p=0.036)
and during hospital stay (35 vs 37 g/L, p=0.015). Compared with younger patients,
older patients were more likely to have experienced nadir platelet counts of
<50×109/L (AOR 2.897, 95% CI to 1.176 to 7.137, p=0.021). They were also more
likely to require an extended hospital stay (AOR 3.547, 95% CI 1.575 to 7.986,
p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of dengue in older people may be challenging because of
atypical presentations. Increased vigilance is necessary as there is an increased
tendency to develop severe thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and prolonged
hospitalisation in older people.
