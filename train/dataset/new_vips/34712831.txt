Aim of the study: Growing data show that toll-like receptors (TLRs) have
considerable roles in the pathogenesis of many liver diseases. We aimed to study 
the relation between TLR3 and TLR7 levels and clinical manifestations of liver
decompensation among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected Child-Pugh B patients.
Material and methods: This study included 60 adult patients with Child-Pugh B
liver cirrhosis on top of untreated HCV infection. We performed a two-step
clustering algorithm depending on TLR-3 gene expression, TLR-7 gene expression,
and other influential patients' characteristics.
Results: Patients were optimally divided into 2 clusters, each cluster containing
30 patients. The average silhouette score of the clustering algorithm was 0.52,
indicating a good clustering power of the model. Patients in cluster 1 showed
lower relative expression of TLR3 (0.188 vs. 0.29). The same was true of TLR7
(0.20 vs. 0.31). All patients within cluster 1 had lower limb edema and 93% of
them had ascites. On the other hand, no one within cluster 2 had ascites or lower
limb edema. The mean platelet count was lower in patients within cluster 1
(74,000 vs. 100,000 cell/mm3). The mean international normalized ratio (INR)
level was higher in cluster 1 (1.61 vs. 1.3). The mean Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score was higher in cluster 1 (15 vs. 10).
Conclusions: From these results, we can suggest that lower TLR3 and TLR7 can lead
to worse clinical manifestations among patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis.
A deeper exploration of this point can open the door for new approaches for
managing decompensated cirrhosis.
