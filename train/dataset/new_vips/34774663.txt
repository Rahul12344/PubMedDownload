We propose a mathematical model to investigate the antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE) phenomenon during secondary dengue infection. The model consists of an ODE 
system that describes the interaction of the dengue virus with macrophages and
memory B and T cell role during the infection. The qualitative model analysis is 
done in terms of memory B and T cell cloning parameters and the basic
reproduction number R0. In the absence of memory B and T cell cloning, if R0<1
the dengue virus population extinguishes, while for R0>1, it tends asymptotically
to a positive equilibrium. However, when we consider the memory B cell cloning,
it is possible to occur dengue infection even when R0<1. Memory T cells have an
essential role in eliminating the possibility of ADE occurrence when R0<1.
