Information on hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains circulating in animal reservoirs
in Bulgaria is currently lacking. Herein, by screening HEV seropositive sera
obtained from Bulgarian swine and wild boars, viral RNA was detected at high
prevalence rate (28.2%) in industrial pigs. Sequence analysis of the partial
polymerase (RdRp) region revealed the highest genetic correlation with HEVs of
genotype (Gt) 3 identified in French and Dutch patients. For three such strains, 
a 700-bp fragment of the open reading frame 2 gene was generated. On phylogenetic
analysis, the Bulgarian strains clustered tightly (93.8-98.3% nt) with human and 
animal HEVs classified within the Gt3 subtype c.
