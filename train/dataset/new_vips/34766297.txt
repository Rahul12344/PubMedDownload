Transcription factors (TFs) are key players in the control of gene expression and
consequently all major cellular process, ranging from cell fate determination to 
cell cycle control and response to the environment.In particular cases, their
ectopic expression has shown great promise in cell reprogramming for regenerative
medicine, ontogenesis studies, and cell modeling. The current reprogramming
methods mainly rely on gene transfer, therefore require technological
improvements to limit genetic imprinting and improve safety. Direct protein
delivery could represent an attractive alternative. Cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs) fused to recombinant TFs or other proteins involved in the epigenetic
definition of cells have great potential in this context. We have thus developed 
the direct vectorization of Oct4, Sox2, or Nanog TFs and the posttranscriptional 
regulatory RNA-binding protein Lin28a by using the minimal transduction domain
(MD11) of Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein.This section describes the molecular
cloning and production of different TFs fused to ZEBRA MD11 domain in the E. coli
expression system. We also include the optimized purification conditions for each
recombinant protein. The treatment of primary fibroblasts as well as cord
blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells is also described. Finally, the
transcriptional activation of the target genes following the transfer of TFs
analyzed by quantitative PCR is presented.Our work primarily finds applications
for advanced medicinal products, an area that requires novel therapy designs and 
delivery systems devoid of genetic material transfer to improve safety.
