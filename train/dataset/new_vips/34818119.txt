AbstractSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants have continued
to emerge in diverse geographic locations with a temporal distribution. The
Lambda variant containing multiple mutations in the spike protein, has thus far
appeared mainly in South America. The variant harbours two mutations in the
receptor binding domain, L452Q and F490S, which may change its infectivity and
antigenicity to neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we constructed 10
pseudoviruses to study the Lambda variant and each individual amino acid
mutation's effect on viral function, and used eight cell lines to study variant
infectivity. In total, 12 monoclonal antibodies, 14 convalescent sera, and 23
immunized sera induced by mRNA vaccines, inactivated vaccine, and adenovirus type
5 vector vaccine were used to study the antigenicity of the Lambda variant. We
found that compared with the D614G reference strain, Lambda demonstrated enhanced
infectivity of Calu-3 and LLC-MK2 cells by 3.3-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively.
Notably, the sensitivity of the Lambda variant to 5 of 12 neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies, 9G11, AM180, R126, X593, and AbG3, was substantially diminished.
Furthermore, convalescent- and vaccine-immunized sera showed on average
1.3-2.5-fold lower neutralizing titres against the Lambda variant. Single
mutation analysis revealed that this reduction in neutralization was caused by
L452Q and F490S mutations. Collectively, the reduced neutralization ability of
the Lambda variant suggests that the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and
vaccines may be compromised during the current pandemic.
