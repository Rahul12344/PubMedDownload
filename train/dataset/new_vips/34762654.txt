PURPOSE: The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the development and
progression of presbyopia and the status of dry eye-related symptoms from 2017 to
2020, to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Near add power at 30 cm was measured in 339 participants aged between 40
and 55 from 2017 to 2021 at Japanese eye clinics. Regression analysis of near add
power and age was analyzed to compare 2017 with later years up to the pandemic.
The prevalence of dry eye-related signs and six common symptoms were compared.
RESULTS: The number and mean age (y) of participants were 183 (48.6±4.1) in 2017,
46 (51.3±7.5) in 2019, and 110 (49.2±3.7) in 2020-21, respectively. The mean
progression rate of near add power (D/y) was 0.13 for 2017, 0.09 for 2019 (P =
0.028, vs 2017), and 0.08 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs 2017). The slope (rate of
presbyopia progression) became flatter from 2017 to 2021 and the estimated near
add power at the age of 40 increased from 2017 to 2020-2021, implicating
presbyopia developed earlier and worsened during the study period. The 2017
values were comparable with previous studies described in 1922 and 2019. The
standardized correlation coefficient between age and near add power was 0.816 for
2017, 0.671 for 2019 (P = 0.084, vs 2017), and 0.572 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs
2017). Multiple regression analysis revealed age and COVID-19 pandemic were
significantly correlated with near add power. The prevalence of dryness
irritation, and pain was greater in 2020-21 than in 2017 with no difference in
the prevalence of eye fatigue, blurring, and photophobia. There was no difference
in the prevalence of short tear break-up time and positive corneal staining among
2017, 2019 and 2020-21.
CONCLUSION: Estimated presbyopia developed earlier and progressed slower from
2017 to 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress and rapid digitalization related to
strict infection control and quarantine might be contributing factors.
