Background: Right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) dysfunction is a common
long-term complication in adult patients with pulmonary atresia/ventricular
septal defect (PA/VSD). Common causes include valve thrombosis, stent fractures, 
and graft calcification. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case
of malignant invasion of a Gore-Tex conduit, causing severe right ventricle (RV) 
failure.
Case summary: A 30-year-old woman with a history of PA/VSD with major
aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) presented with worsening dyspnoea and
exercise intolerance. In infancy, she underwent unifocalization of the right- and
left-sided AP collaterals utilizing an 18 and 16 mm Gore-Tex graft, respectively.
At age 7, she had surgical repair with VSD patch closure and placement of a 20 mm
right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RVPA) homograft connected to a 20 mm Gore-Tex
graft with linkage to the previously placed right and left unifocalization
grafts. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severely dilated RV and a
heavily calcified RVOT conduit with severe stenosis. Cardiac computed tomography 
showed a stenotic RVPA conduit with calcified mural mass. She underwent surgical 
revision of the RVPA conduit with thromboendarterectomy of bilateral pulmonary
arteries. Pathology of the removed conduit revealed fibrin-associated
Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (FA DLBCL).
Discussion: One prior case report has demonstrated invasion of DLBCL involving an
aortic synthetic tube graft. However, malignant invasion of the RVOT Gore-Tex
conduit has yet to be reported. Pathological review can be essential in guiding
management. Malignant invasion of Gore-Tex conduits is a rare phenomenon, but one
that should be closely monitored following repair of the RVOT.
