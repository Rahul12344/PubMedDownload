Introduction: Assessing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
and vaccines on controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is key for
each government to optimize the anti-contagion policy according to their
situation.
Methods: We proposed the Braking Force Model on Virus Transmission to evaluate
the validity and efficiency of NPIs and vaccines. This model classified the NPIs 
and the administration of vaccines at different effectiveness levels and
forecasted the duration required to control the pandemic, providing an indication
of the future trends of the pandemic wave.
Results: This model was applied to study the effectiveness of the most commonly
used NPIs according to the historic pandemic waves in different countries and
regions. It was found that when facing an outbreak, only strict lockdown would
give efficient control of the pandemic; the other NPIs were insufficient to
promptly and effectively reduce virus transmission. Meanwhile, our results showed
that NPIs would likely only slow down the pandemic's progression and maintain a
low transmission level but fail to eradicate the disease. Only vaccination would 
likely have had a better chance of success in ending the pandemic.
Discussion: Based on the Braking Force Model, a pandemic control strategy
framework has been devised for policymakers to determine the commencement and
duration of appropriate interventions, with the aim of obtaining a balance
between public health risk management and economic recovery.
