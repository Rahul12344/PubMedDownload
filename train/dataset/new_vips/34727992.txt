BACKGROUND: The symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the novel severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, were originally assumed to be mainly
respiratory. With increasing knowledge, however, it turned out that the spectrum 
of complaints varies broadly with age and concomitant diseases. While many
neurological symptoms were reported in the context of the disease, ranging from
permanent fatigue to recurrent headaches and concentration disturbance, treatment
approaches are still in development. This case discusses a possible treatment
approach with immunoglobulin therapy and its outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 56-year-old Caucasian female patient 
who, following coronavirus disease 2019, developed peripheral sensory and
autonomic disturbances that fell within subacute demyelinating neuropathy.
Because a significant improvement in symptoms as well as in the results of
clinical and electrophysiological examination was reported after immunoglobulin
therapy, long-term therapy does not appear to be necessary.
CONCLUSION: Given the significant subjective and objective improvement reported, 
this case provides additional evidence that immunoglobulin therapy can be
considered in post-coronavirus disease 2019 syndrome.
