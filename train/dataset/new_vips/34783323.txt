. Looking for stolen time: two years that worth four. The pandemic had a
considerable impact on the mental health of health care personnel, as documented 
by a study, conducted on 550 employees of different profiles of a university
hospital in Milan. Workers report war-like experiences. The initial gratitude of 
the population was followed by an attitude of rejection, as health workers were
considered carriers of contagion. Financial recognition went only to the
managers. The one against Covid was a war, and the nurses the combatants.
Strategies can be activated to recognize the commitment and sacrifice of those
who were (and remained) on the front lines.
