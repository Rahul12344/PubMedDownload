Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, degenerative muscle disorder
caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to severe reduction or absence of
the protein dystrophin. Gene therapy strategies that aim to increase expression
of a functional dystrophin protein (mini-dystrophin) are under investigation. The
ability to accurately quantify dystrophin/mini-dystrophin is essential in
assessing the level of gene transduction. We demonstrated the validation and
application of a novel peptide immunoaffinity liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (IA-LC-MS/MS) assay. Data showed that dystrophin expression in
Becker muscular dystrophy and DMD tissues, normalized against the mean of
non-dystrophic control tissues (n = 20), was 4-84.5% (mean 32%, n = 20) and
0.4-24.1% (mean 5%, n = 20), respectively. In a DMD rat model, biceps femoris
tissue from dystrophin-deficient rats treated with AAV9.hCK.Hopti-Dys3978.spA, an
adeno-associated virus vector containing a mini-dystrophin transgene, showed a
dose-dependent increase in mini-dystrophin expression at 6 months post-dose,
exceeding wildtype dystrophin levels at high doses. Validation data showed that
inter- and intra-assay precision were ≤20% (≤25% at the lower limit of
quantification [LLOQ]) and inter- and intra-run relative error was within ±20%
(±25% at LLOQ). IA-LC-MS/MS accurately quantifies dystrophin/mini-dystrophin in
human and preclinical species with sufficient sensitivity for immediate
application in preclinical/clinical trials.
