BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have demonstrated the disproportionate impact that
COVID-19 has had on vulnerable populations. Our purpose is to describe our health
care system's response to this impact.
METHODS: We convened a Workgroup with the goal to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
on the most medically vulnerable people in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA,
particularly those with significant social needs. We did this through (1)
identifying vulnerable patients in high-need geographic areas, (2) developing and
implementing a needs assessment/outreach tool tailored to meet cultural,
linguistic and religious backgrounds, (3) surveying pharmacies for access to
medication delivery, (4) gathering information about sources of food delivery,
groceries and/or prepared food, (5) gathering information about means of travel, 
and (6) assessing need for testing. We then combined these six elements into a
patient-oriented branch and a community outreach/engagement branch.
CONCLUSIONS: Our highly intentional and methodical approach to patient and
community outreach with a strong geographic component has led to fruitful efforts
in COVID-19 mitigation. Our patient-level outreach engages our health centers'
clinical teams, particularly community health workers, and is providing the
direct benefit of material and service resources for our at-risk patients and
their families. Our community efforts leveraged existing relationships and
created new partnerships that continue to inform us-healthcare entities,
healthcare employees, and clinical teams-so that we can grow and learn in order
to authentically build trust and engagement.
