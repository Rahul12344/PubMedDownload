Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics around the world have created public health
concern with the unavailability of effective drugs and vaccines. This emphasizes 
the need for molecular understanding of host-virus interactions for developing
effective targeted antivirals. Microarray analysis was carried out using CHIKV
strain (Prototype and Indian) infected Vero cells and two host isozymes, MAPK
activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) and MAPK activated protein kinase 3 (MK3) were
selected for further analysis. The substrate spectrum of both enzymes is
indistinguishable and covers proteins involved in cytokines production,
endocytosis, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, cell cycle
control, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Gene silencing and 
drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3
in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV
progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation inhibitor (CMPD1)
treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role 
of MAPKAPKs during late CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that
the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of
lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin
cytoskeleton remodeling pathway. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice
demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and
better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression 
of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in
HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness
of the drug against CHIKV. Taken together it can be proposed that MK2 and MK3 are
crucial host factors for CHIKV infection and can be considered as important
target for developing effective anti-CHIKV strategies.
