The tilapia lake virus (TiLV), a highly infectious negative-sense single-stranded
segmented RNA virus, has caused several outbreaks worldwide since its first
report from Israel in 2014, and continues to pose a major threat to the global
tilapia industry. Despite its economic importance, little is known about the
underlying mechanisms in the genomic evolution of this highly infectious viral
pathogen. Using phylogenomic approaches to the genome sequences of TiLV isolates 
from various geographic regions, we report on the pervasive role of reassortment,
selection, and mutation in TiLV evolution. Our findings provided the evidence of 
genome-wide reassortment in this newly discovered RNA virus. The rate of
non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions was less than one
(dN/dS = 0.076 to 0.692), indicating that each genomic segment has been subjected
to purifying selection. Concurrently, the rate of nucleotide substitution for
each genomic segment was in the order of 1-3 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per 
site per year, which is comparable to the rate of other RNA viruses.
Collectively, in line with the results of the previous studies, our results
demonstrated that reassortment is the dominant force in the evolution and
emergence of this highly infectious segmented RNA virus.
