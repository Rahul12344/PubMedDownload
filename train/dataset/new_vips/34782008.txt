BACKGROUND: The North American opioid crisis is driven by opioid-related
mortality and morbidity, including opioid use-associated infections (OUAIs),
resulting in a substantial burden for society. Users of legal and illegal opioids
are at an increased risk of OUAIs compared to individuals not using opioids. As
reported for hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
bacterial, fungal, and other infections, OUAIs transmission and acquisition risks
may be modifiable. Several systematic reviews (SRs) synthetized data regarding
interventions to prevent infections in persons using drugs (e.g., opioid
substitution therapy, needle and syringes exchange programs, psycho-social
interventions); however, their conclusions varied. Therefore, SR of published SRs
is needed to synthesize the highest level of evidence on the scope and
effectiveness of interventions to prevent OUAIs in people using opioids legally
or illegally.
METHODS: We will comprehensively search for SRs in the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, and Google Scholar
databases from inception to November 2020. Data selection and extraction for each
SR will be performed independently by two researchers, with disagreements
resolved by consensus. All SRs regarding interventions with evaluated
effectiveness to prevent OUAI in legal and/or illegal opioid users will be
eligible. Risk of bias assessment will be performed using the AMSTAR2 tool. The
results will be qualitatively synthesized, and a typology of interventions'
effectiveness with a statement on the strength of evidence for each category will
be created.
DISCUSSION: Our pilot search of PubMed resulted in 379 SRs analyzing the
effectiveness of interventions to prevent HCV and HIV in persons who inject
different types of drugs, including opioids. Of these 379 SRs, 8 evaluated
primary studies where participants used opioids and would therefore be eligible
for inclusion. The search results thus justify the application of SR of SRs
approach. Comprehensive data on the scope and effectiveness of existing
interventions to prevent OUAIs will help policy-makers to plan and implement
preventive interventions and will assist clinicians in the guidance for their
patients using opioids.
