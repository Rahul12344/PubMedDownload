BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccines provide renewed hope in the fight against the
recent pandemic. To ensure widespread vaccination, it is crucial to analyze
vaccine willingness and its determinants among physicians, key health care
influencers. This study aimed to assess acceptance rate and identify factors
associated with vaccine hesitancy among Thai physicians.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online-based questionnaire was distributed to all
physicians at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during March 31, 2021 to April
30, 2021 in order to assess their attitudes toward receiving the COVID-19
vaccine. Reasons for vaccine acceptance and refusal as well as predictors of
vaccine hesitancy were analyzed by bivariate and multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 705 complete responses were received with 95.6% (n = 675) of 
physicians expressing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Only one of the 
31 physicians (4.4%) who expressed a hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated 
was a faculty member; the others were physicians-in-training. Approximately
one-fifths of physicians surveyed were also not willing to recommend the vaccine 
to their family members (21.4%, n = 151) or patients (18.7%, n = 132). Using
multivariable logistic regression, vaccine hesitancy was independently associated
with preference for particular vaccines over the government allocated option,
especially for mRNA vaccine (aOR 8.86; 95% CI 1.1-71.54; p = 0.041). Vaccine
literacy showed an inverse relationship (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13-0.9; p = 0.029)
with vaccine hesitancy. Uncertainty of the vaccine efficacy (83.9%) and fear of
adverse events (48.4%) were major concerns contributing to vaccine hesitancy.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high rate of physician willingness to take the 
COVID-19 vaccine especially among staffs; however, a significant proportion would
not currently suggest vaccination to their families or patients. Restrictions on 
vaccine choice and vaccine illiteracy, together with concerns over adverse
effects and uncertainty of efficacy, were associated with negative attitudes
toward vaccination. To raise acceptance of the vaccination program, efforts
should be made to balance individual preference for vaccine type in addition to
increasing the availability of accurate data on safety and efficacy for each
vaccine.
