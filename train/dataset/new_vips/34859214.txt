Mechanisms underlying chronic neuropathic pain associated with HIV-associated
distal sensory polyneuropathy are poorly understood, yet 40% of those with distal
neuropathy (or 20% of all people with HIV) suffer from this debilitating
condition. Central pain processing mechanisms are thought to contribute to the
development of HIV neuropathic pain, yet studies investigating central mechanisms
for HIV neuropathic pain are few. Considering the motivational nature of pain, we
aimed to examine the degree to which expectation of pain onset and expectation of
pain offset are altered in sixty-one male patients with HIV-related distal
sensory polyneuropathy with (N = 30) and without (N = 31) chronic neuropathic
pain. By contrasting painful (foot) and non-painful (hand) sites between those
with and without neuropathic pain, we could identify unique neural structures
that showed altered activation during expectation of pain offset or relief. Our
results showed no evidence for peripheral mechanisms evidenced by lack of
significant between group differences in thermo-sensation, subjective pain
response or epidermal nerve fibre density. Likewise, we found no significant
differences between groups in subjective or brain mechanisms underlying the
expectation of pain onset. Conversely, we found significant interaction within
right anterior insula during expectation of pain offset in our study in that
individuals in the pain group compared to the no-pain group exhibited increased
anterior insula activation on the painful compared to the non-painful site. Our
findings are consistent with abnormal processing of expectation of pain offset or
abnormal pain relief-related mechanisms potentially due to increased emotional
distress regarding the experience of chronic endogenous pain.
