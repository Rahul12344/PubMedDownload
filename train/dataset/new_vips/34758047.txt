OBJECTIVE: Explore how previous work during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak affects the psychological response of clinical and
non-clinical healthcare workers (HCWs) to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, multi-centered hospital online survey of HCWs in the 
Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Mental health outcomes of HCWs who worked during
the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS outbreak were assessed using Impact of
Events-Revised scale (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: Among 3852 participants, moderate/severe scores for symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (50.2%), anxiety (24.6%), and depression (31.5%)
were observed among HCWs. Work during the 2003 SARS outbreak was reported by 1116
respondents (29.1%), who had lower scores for symptoms of PTSD (P = .002),
anxiety (P < .001), and depression (P < .001) compared to those who had not
worked during the SARS outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis
showed non-clinical HCWs during this pandemic were at higher risk of anxiety (OR,
1.68; 95% CI, 1.19-2.15, P = .01) and depressive symptoms (OR, 2.03; 95% CI,
1.34-3.07, P < .001). HCWs using sedatives (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.61-4.03, P <
.001), those who cared for only 2-5 patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.59; 95% CI,
1.06-2.38, P = .01), and those who had been in isolation for COVID-19 (OR, 1.36; 
95% CI, 0.96-1.93, P = .05), were at higher risk of moderate/severe symptoms of
PTSD. In addition, deterioration in sleep was associated with symptoms of PTSD
(OR, 4.68, 95% CI, 3.74-6.30, P < .001), anxiety (OR, 3.09, 95% CI, 2.11-4.53, P 
< .001), and depression (OR 5.07, 95% CI, 3.48-7.39, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Psychological distress was observed in both clinical and non-clinical
HCWs, with no impact from previous SARS work experience. As the pandemic
continues, increasing psychological and team support may decrease the mental
health impacts.
