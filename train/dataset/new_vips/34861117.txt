Carbon "quantum" dots or carbon dots (CDots) exploit and enhance the intrinsic
photoexcited state properties and processes of small carbon nanoparticles via
effective nanoparticle surface passivation by chemical functionalization with
organic species. The optical properties and photoinduced redox characteristics of
CDots are competitive to those of established conventional semiconductor quantum 
dots and also fullerenes and other carbon nanomaterials. Highlighted here are
major advances in the exploration of CDots for their serving as high-performance 
yet nontoxic fluorescence probes for one- and multi-photon bioimaging in vitro
and in vivo, and for their uniquely potent antimicrobial function to inactivate
effectively and efficiently some of the toughest bacterial pathogens and viruses 
under visible/natural or ambient light conditions. Opportunities and challenges
in the further development of the CDots platform and related technologies are
discussed.
