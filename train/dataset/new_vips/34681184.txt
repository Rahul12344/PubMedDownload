Influenza is a highly contagious, acute respiratory illness, which represents one
of the main health issues worldwide. Even though some antivirals are available,
the alarming increase in virus strains resistant to them highlights the need to
find new drugs. Previously, Superti et al. deeply investigated the mechanism of
the anti-influenza virus effect of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) and the role of its
tryptic fragments (the N- and C-lobes) in antiviral activity. Recently, through a
truncation library, we identified the tetrapeptides, Ac-SKHS-NH2 (1) and
Ac-SLDC-NH2 (2), derived from bLf C-lobe fragment 418-429, which were able to
bind hemagglutinin (HA) and inhibit cell infection in a concentration range of
femto- to picomolar. Starting from these results, in this work, we initiated a
systematic SAR study on the peptides mentioned above, through an alanine scanning
approach. We carried out binding affinity measurements by microscale
thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), as well as
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (NT) assays on
synthesized peptides. Computational studies were performed to identify possible
ligand-HA interactions. Results obtained led to the identification of an
interesting peptide endowed with broad anti-influenza activity and able to
inhibit viral infection to a greater extent of reference peptide.
