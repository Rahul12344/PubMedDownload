The H1N1 subtype influenza viruses (H1N1) have been causing persistent epidemics 
in human, swine and poultry populations since 1918. This subtype has evolved into
four relatively stable genetic lineages, including classical swine influenza
virus lineage, seasonal human influenza virus lineage, avian influenza virus
lineage and Eurasian avian-like swine influenza virus lineage. In this study,
four pairs of primers, based on the relatively conserved HA nucleotide regions of
each H1N1 genetic lineage, were designed to establish a SYBR Green-based
real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) assay to differentiate between the H1N1
genetic lineages. The results of qPCR assay showed that the lineage-specific
primers designed for each H1N1 lineage were intra-lineage-specific, without
mismatch of inter-lineage or inter-subtype and there appeared specific
amplification curves when the concentrations of H1N1 plasmids were greater than
or equal to 1.0 × 101 copies/reaction. Thus, this qPCR assay can specifically
differentiate between the four lineages of H1N1 with a good specificity and
sensitivity, which would assist in recognizing the infection and epidemic status 
of different H1N1 genetic lineages.
