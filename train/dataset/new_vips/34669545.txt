The 28th American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (ASNTR) returned to the
Sheraton Sand Key in Clearwater Beach, Florida after an 18 month hiatus. Like
nearly all conferences during the pandemic, the ASNTR conference was held in
person while offering a virtual option to the event. These formats are
advantageous for those under travel restrictions or personal constraints, but
they lack the spontaneity of in-person connections. Highlights from the meeting
included the return of the Bernard Sanberg Memorial Award and the Roy Bakay
Memorial lecture. The presidential lecture was given by Gabriel de Erausquin, who
discussed the possibility of long-term CNS effects resulting from SARS-CoV2
infection. With both virtual and in-person events, including oral and poster
presentations, the ASNTR managed to maintain the unique essence of this small
important meeting.
