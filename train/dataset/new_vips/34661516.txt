The polymerase acidic (PA) I38T substitution is a dominant marker of resistance
to baloxavir. We evaluated the impact of I38T on the fitness of a contemporary
influenza A(H3N2) virus. Influenza A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) wild-type
(WT) virus and its I38T mutant were rescued by reverse genetics. Replication
kinetics were compared using ST6GalI-MDCK and A549 cells and infectivity/contact 
transmissibility were evaluated in guinea pigs. Nasal wash (NW) viral titres were
determined by TCID50 ml-1 in ST6GalI-MDCK cells. Competition experiments were
performed and the evolution of viral population was assessed by droplet digital
RT-PCR. I38T did not alter in vitro replication. I38T induced comparable titres
vs the WT in guinea pigs NWs and the two viruses transmitted equally by direct
contact. However, a 50 %:50 % mixture inoculum evolved to mean WT/I38T ratios of 
71 %:29 % and 66.4 %:33.6 % on days 4 and 6 p.i., respectively. Contemporary
influenza A(H3N2)-I38T PA variants may conserve a significant level of viral
fitness.
