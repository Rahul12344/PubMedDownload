ABSTRACT: University and facility closures because of COVID-19 required nursing
programs to develop innovative ways to ensure students met clinical hour
requirements, standards, and expectations. One rural university utilized
student-directed livestream virtual simulation sessions that included synchronous
prebriefing, student-directed simulation activity, and immediate debriefing.
Students were anonymously surveyed for feedback and evaluation of the activities.
Students reported the sessions were helpful for learning and required use of
prioritization, clinical judgment, and communication/collaboration skills. Other 
responses included communication issues, audiovisual issues, and low realism,
which prompted future recommendations.
