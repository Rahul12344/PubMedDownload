With rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant microbes, it is imperative to seek
alternative means for infection control. Optical waveguides are an auspicious
delivery method for precise administration of phototherapy. Studies have shown
that phototherapy is promising in fighting against a myriad of infectious
pathogens (i.e. viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) including biofilm-forming
species and drug-resistant strains while evading treatment resistance. When
administered via optical waveguides, phototherapy can treat both superficial and 
deep-tissue infections while minimizing off-site effects that afflict
conventional phototherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite great therapeutic
potential, exact mechanisms, materials, and fabrication designs to optimize this 
promising treatment option are underexplored. This review outlines principles and
applications of phototherapy and optical waveguides for infection control.
Research advances, challenges, and outlook regarding this delivery system are
rigorously discussed in a hope to inspire future developments of optical
waveguide-mediated phototherapy for the management of infection and beyond.
