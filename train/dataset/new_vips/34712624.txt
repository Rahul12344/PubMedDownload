Viruses are diverse pathogens that use host factors to enter cells and cause
disease. Imaging the entry and replication phases of viruses and their
interactions with host factors is key to fully understanding viral infections.
This review will discuss how confocal microscopy and imaging flow cytometry are
used to investigate virus entry and replication mechanisms in fixed and live
cells. Quantification of viral images and the use of cryo-electron microscopy to 
gather structural information of viruses is also explored. Using imaging to
understand how viruses replicate and interact with host factors, we gain insight 
into cellular processes and identify novel targets to develop antiviral
therapeutics and vaccines.
