INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the role of school-aged children and
household transmission at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To evaluate for
SARS-CoV-2 in school-aged children and assess household transmission, we
performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on 670 archived
specimens that were collected between September 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 as part
of a community-based study.
CASE PRESENTATION: A single SARS-CoV-2 case was detected in an 11-year-old girl
on March 18, 2020, resulting in very low prevalence (0.15% [95% CI, 0.03-0.84])
in this population. This case was associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection in all
other household members. Symptoms were reported as mild to moderate. Whole genome
sequencing supported household transmission of near-identical viruses within the 
19B clade.
DISCUSSION: This case represents the earliest known household cluster of
SARS-CoV2 in Wisconsin.
CONCLUSION: This case suggests that household transmission associated with
school-aged children may have contributed to wide seeding across populations.
