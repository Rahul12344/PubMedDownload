We report a case of a 14-year-old non-immunised girl with a prior history of
measles infection presenting with afebrile seizures progressing to epilepsia
partialis continua (EPC), quadriparesis and headache. Further evaluation revealed
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity with elevated anti-measles
antibody titres in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Electroencephalography showed focal
epileptiform activity and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed 
bilateral, asymmetrical long repetition time MRI (TR) hyperintensities involving 
juxtacortical white matter in both parietal lobes, left temporal and also in the 
left basal ganglia without any contrast enhancement or Diffusion weighted imaging
(DWI) restriction. We describe the intriguing association of EPC with subacute
measles encephalitis/measles inclusion body encephalitis (SME/MIBE) in the
backdrop of immunocompromised state (HIV seropositivity), thought to have been
acquired by vertical transmission. Also, prolonged asymptomatic HIV infection,
first unmasked by measles infection, followed by rapidly deteriorating
neurological illness makes this index case worthy to be reported.
