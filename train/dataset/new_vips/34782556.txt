As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to 
spread globally, it became evident that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects multiple
organs including the brain. Several clinical studies revealed that patients with 
COVID-19 infection experience an array of neurological signs ranging in severity 
from headaches to life-threatening strokes. Although the exact mechanism by which
the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly impacts the brain is not fully understood, several 
theories have been suggested including direct and indirect pathways induced by
the virus. One possible theory is the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain occurs 
either through the bloodstream or via the nerve endings which is considered to be
the direct route. Such findings are based on studies reporting the presence of
viral material in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain cells. Nevertheless, the
indirect mechanisms, including blood-clotting abnormalities and prolonged
activation of the immune system, can result in further tissue and organ damages
seen during the course of the disease. This overview attempts to give a thorough 
insight into SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus neurological infection and highlights the
possible mechanisms leading to the neurological manifestations observed in
infected patients.
