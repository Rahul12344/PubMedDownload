Four undescribed cucurbitacins, designated as petiolaticins A-D, and four known
cucurbitacins were isolated from the bark and leaves of Elaeocarpus petiolatus
(Jack) Wall. Their chemical structures were elucidated based on detailed analyses
of the NMR and MS data. The absolute configuration of petiolaticin A was also
determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. Petiolaticin A represents a
cucurbitacin derivative incorporating a 3,4-epoxyfuranyl-bearing side chain,
while petiolaticin B possesses a furopyranyl unit fused to the tetracyclic
cucurbitane core structure. Petiolaticins A, B, and D were evaluated in vitro
against a panel of human breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer cell lines.
Petiolaticin A exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SW48 cell lines (IC50 7.4, 9.2, 9.3, and 4.6 μM,
respectively). Additionally, petiolaticin D,
16α,23α-epoxy-3β,20β-dihydroxy-10αH,23βH-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one, and
16α,23α-epoxy-3β,20β-dihydroxy-10αH,23βH-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one
3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside were tested for their ability to inhibit cell entry of a 
pseudotyped virus bearing the hemagglutinin envelope protein of a highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus. Petiolaticin D showed the highest inhibition
(44.3%), followed by
16α,23α-epoxy-3β,20β-dihydroxy-10αH,23βH-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one (21.0%), and
16α,23α-epoxy-3β,20β-dihydroxy-10αH,23βH-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one
3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside showed limited inhibition (9.0%). These preliminary
biological assays have demonstrated that petiolaticins A and D possess anticancer
and antiviral properties, respectively, which warrant for further investigations.
