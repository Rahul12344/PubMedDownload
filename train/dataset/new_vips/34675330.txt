Implementation of various restrictions to eradicate viral diseases has globally
affected human activity and subsequently nature. But how can the altered routines
of human activity (restrictions, lockdowns) affect wildlife behaviour? This study
compared the differences between human and wildlife occurrences in the study
forest area with acreage of 5430.6 ha in 2018 (African swine fever outbreak,
complete entrance ban), 2019 (standard pattern) and 2020 (COVID-19 restrictions) 
during the breeding season. The number of visitors was lower by 64% in 2018
(non-respecting of the entry ban by forest visitors) compared to standard 2019,
while in 2020, the number of visitors increased to 151%. In the COVID-19 period, 
distinct peaks in the number of visitors were observed between 8-11 AM and 4-7
PM. The peaks of wildlife activity were recorded between 4-7 AM and 9-12 PM.
Animals avoided the localities that were visited by humans during the
people-influenced time (24 h after people visit), which confirmed the direct
negative impact of human activities on wildlife.
