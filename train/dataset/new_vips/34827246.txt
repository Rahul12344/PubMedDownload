The COVID-19 infection caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus has been linked to a
broad spectrum of symptoms, from a mild cough to life-threatening pneumonia. As
we learn more about this unusual COVID-19 epidemic, new issues are emerging and
being reported daily. Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis or phycomycosis,
causes severe fungal illness to individuals with a weakened immune system. It is 
a devastating fungal infection, and the most frequent kind is the rhino cerebral 
type. As a devastating second wave of COVID-19 sweeps India, doctors report
several instances involving a strange illness-sometimes known as the "black
fungus"-among returning and recovered COVID-19 patients. This paper analyzes the 
existing statistical data to address the severity of prevalence and further notes
the nano-based diagnostic parameters, clinical presentations, its connection with
other conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and GI disorders, and the
importance of anti-fungal therapy in treating the same. Anti-fungal therapies, as
well as surgical interventions, are currently used for the treatment of the
disease. Proper and timely diagnosis is necessary, along with the reduction in
the spread of COVID-19. From the review, it was found that timely pharmacologic
interventions and early diagnosis by using a nano-based diagnostic kit can help
control the disease. Additionally, this paper provides novel information about
the nanotechnology approaches such as fungal detection biosensors, nucleic
acids-based testing, point-of-care tests, and galactomannans detection, in the
diagnosis of mucormycosis, and thereby reinforces the need for further research
on the topic.
