BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 continues to spread
globally and in the absence of an effective treatment, the vaccine remains the
best hope for controlling this disease. In this study, we seek to find out the
extent to which people in Syria accept the Corona vaccine and what are the
factors that affect their decision.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Syria during the period from
January 3 to March 17, 2021. A structured self-administered questionnaire was
distributed in two phases: The first phase included distributing the
questionnaire as a Google Form on social media platforms. In the second phase, a 
paper version of the questionnaire was handed to patients, their companions, and 
workers in public hospitals. SPSS v.25 and R v.4.1.1 were used to analyze the
data. Pearson Chi-square test and Logistic Regression were used to study the
associations between categorical groups.
RESULTS: Of 7531 respondents, 3505 (46.5%) were males and 4026 (53.5%) were
females. 3124 (41.5%) were 18-24 years old. Healthcare workers were participants'
main sources of information (50.9%), followed by Social Media users (46.3%). 2790
(37%) of the participant are willing to be vaccinated, and 2334 (31%) were
uncertain about it. Fear of possible side effects was the main reason for the
reluctance to take the vaccine 1615 (62.4%), followed by mistrust of the vaccine 
formula 1522 (58.8%). 2218 (29.5%) participants think COVID-19 poses a major risk
to them personally. Vaccination intention was significantly associated with
gender, residence, financial status, educational level, and geographic origin.
CONCLUSION: This study showed very negatively important results. The study
participants Vaccination acceptance rate is almost the lowest when compared to
its peers. A Lot of efforts should be made to correct misinformation about the
vaccine and answer all questions about it, especially with a health system that
has been ravaged by war for 10 years.
