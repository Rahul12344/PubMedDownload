The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's lives and has brought society to a
sudden standstill, with lockdowns and social distancing as the preferred
preventative measures. To lift these measurements and reduce society's burden,
developing an easy-to-use, rapid, and portable system to detect SARS-CoV-2 is
mandatory. To this end, we developed a portable and semi-automated device for
SARS-CoV-2 detection based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification followed by a CRISPR/Cas12a reaction. The device contains a heater 
element mounted on a printed circuit board, a cooler fan, a proportional integral
derivative controller to control the temperature, and designated areas for 0.2 mL
EppendorfÂ® PCR tubes. Our system has a limit of detection of 35 copies of the
virus per microliter, which is significant and has the capability of being used
in crisis centers, mobile laboratories, remote locations, or airports to diagnose
individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. We believe the current methodology that we 
have implemented in this article is beneficial for the early screening of
infectious diseases, in which fast screening with high accuracy is necessary.
