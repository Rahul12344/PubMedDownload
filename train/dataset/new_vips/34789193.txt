BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in late 2019. One of
the vaccines approved against COVID-19 is the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine
(Pfizer/BioNTech).
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 71-year-old man with no history of
the SARS-CoV-2 infection or any recent viral or bacterial illnesses who presented
with bilateral oculomotor palsy and limb ataxia after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19
vaccination. The diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) was established based 
on physical examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal
fluid analysis (CSF), and positron emission tomography (PET). There was no
evidence of other predisposing infectious or autoimmune factors, and the period
from COVID-19 vaccination to the appearance of neurological symptoms was similar 
to that of other vaccines and preceding events, such as infection.
CONCLUSION: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants after COVID-19
vaccination are extremely rare. Note that more research is needed to establish an
association between MFS and COVID-19 vaccines. In our opinion, the benefits of
COVID-19 vaccination largely outweigh its risks.
