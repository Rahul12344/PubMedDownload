Viral-induced pancreatitis has been well-defined; however, there are limited data
regarding COVID-19 and pancreatitis. Most cases are commonly in conjunction with 
severe COVID-19 as well as lipase elevation. We describe a unique case of mild
SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in acute pancreatitis in the absence of lipase
elevation. A 39-year-old patient with no medical history, presented with
epigastric pain. Vital signs were unremarkable. Patient was positive for
COVID-19. Liver function panel, calcium, triglyceride and lipase levels were all 
unremarkable. CT of the abdomen demonstrated acute pancreatitis without
gallstones. Our case may indicate that pancreatic injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection 
is due to a direct impact on the pancreas by the virus, given the absence of
lipase elevation and mild presentation. This case highlights the importance of
suspecting pancreatitis in mild COVID-19 that present with atypical symptoms such
as epigastric pain, even without lipase elevation.
