INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread mental health distress.
Few COVID-19 employee wellness initiatives have been evaluated and have primarily
focused on frontline health care workers. This study described the feasibility
and utilization of, and participant satisfaction for virtual COVID-19 employee
wellness sessions at a large university and health system.
METHOD: Thomas Jefferson University behavioral health consultants (BHCs) and
behavioral health leaders developed and offered JeffBeWell (JBW) wellness
sessions over 17 weeks during March 2020 through July 2020. Sessions were
advertised via mass emails and an employee intranet. Multiple live thirty-minute 
sessions were offered weekly; facilitators provided psychoeducation and offered
coping tools. Topics included working remotely, parenting, sleep, nutrition,
grief, anxiety, and yoga and relaxation. Attendance was tracked and participants 
were asked to complete satisfaction surveys; survey data was analyzed using
descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 388 sessions were offered with 1,324 participants. Attendance
rose in weeks 1-5, followed by a decline and then a second increase in Weeks 15
through 17, 213 participants (16%) responded to the survey. The largest portion
of respondents were in academic administrative roles (46%), followed by clinical 
providers and staff (34%) and faculty and students (9%). Of respondents, 91% of
respondents felt that the sessions met their expectations, 92% felt the session
helped them, and 92% planned to attend future sessions.
DISCUSSION: JBW sessions were feasible to implement, attended by diverse
participants and well received by survey respondents, although attendance has
fluctuated during the pandemic. BHCs have refined sessions based on participant
feedback and are tailoring more sessions to specific audiences. (PsycInfo
