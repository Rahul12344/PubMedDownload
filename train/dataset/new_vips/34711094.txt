Background. The COVID-19 pandemic attributable to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has had a significant and continuing impact across
all areas of healthcare including stroke. Individuals post-stroke are at high
risk for infection, disease severity, and mortality after COVID-19 infection.
Exercise stroke rehabilitation programs remain critical for individuals
recovering from stroke to mitigate risk factors and morbidity associated with the
potential long-term consequences of COVID-19. There is currently no exercise
rehabilitation guidance for people post-stroke with a history of COVID-19
infection. Purpose. To (1) review the multi-system pathophysiology of COVID-19
related to stroke and exercise; (2) discuss the multi-system benefits of exercise
for individuals post-stroke with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; and
(3) provide clinical considerations related to COVID-19 for exercise during
stroke rehabilitation. This article is intended for healthcare professionals
involved in the implementation of exercise rehabilitation for individuals
post-stroke who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and non-infected
individuals who want to receive safe exercise rehabilitation. Results. Our
clinical considerations integrate pre-COVID-19 stroke (n = 2) and COVID-19
exercise guidelines for non-stroke populations (athletic [n = 6], pulmonary [n = 
1], cardiac [n = 2]), COVID-19 pathophysiology literature, considerations of
stroke rehabilitation practices, and exercise physiology principles. A clinical
decision-making tool for COVID-19 screening and eligibility for stroke exercise
rehabilitation is provided, along with key subjective and physiological measures 
to guide exercise prescription. Conclusion. We propose that this framework
promotes safe exercise programming within stroke rehabilitation for COVID-19 and 
future infectious disease outbreaks.
