PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused multiple challenges to ICUs, 
including an increased rate of secondary infections, mostly caused by
Gram-negative micro-organisms. Worrying trends of resistance acquisition
complicate this picture. We provide a review of the latest evidence to guide
management of patients with septic shock because of Gram-negative bacteria.
RECENT FINDINGS: New laboratory techniques to detect pathogens and specific
resistance patterns from the initial culture are available. Those may assist
decreasing the time to adequate antimicrobial therapy and avoid unnecessary
broad-spectrum antibiotic overuse. New antimicrobials, including
β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as ceftolozane-tazobactam,
imipenem-relebactam or meropenem-vaborbactam and cephalosporins, such as
cefiderocol targeted to specific pathogens and resistance patterns are available 
for use in the clinical setting. Optimization of antibiotic dosing and delivery
should follow pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and wherever
available therapeutic drug monitoring. Management of sepsis has brought capillary
refill time back to the spotlight along with more reasoned fluid resuscitation
and a moderate approach to timing of dialysis initiation.
SUMMARY: Novel rapid diagnostic tests and antimicrobials specifically targeted to
Gram-negative pathogens are available and should be used within the principles of
antimicrobial stewardship including de-escalation and short duration of
antimicrobial therapy.
