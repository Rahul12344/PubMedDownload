BACKGROUND: AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (AR-PCNSL) is an
AIDS-defining disease that usually occurs when the CD4 count is less than 50
cells/μl. The frequency of the disease has substantially decreased in the era of 
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prognosis is poor with rapid
progression leading to death within 2-3 months if left untreated.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65 years old male presented to medical attention with gait
disturbance, weight loss and slight left-sided hemiparesis. Human
immunodeficiency virus infection was diagnosed with an initial CD4 count of 116
cells/µl and a viral load of 260,000 copies/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain revealed three brain lesions involving the right frontal lobe and the left 
parietal lobe, which on biopsy led to a diagnosis of AR-PCNSL. HAART was
initiated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and the patient declined systemic
chemotherapy. Due to poor performance status, he was transferred to palliative
care. Under HAART, he slowly recovered with normalization of CD4 count and
undetectable viral load. Medical imaging showed complete remission (CR) of the
brain lesions. At 3-year follow-up, the patient remains in CR, but presented mild
neurocognitive dysfunction possibly secondary to WBRT.
CONCLUSION: Nowadays, treatment paradigm parallels that of primary central
nervous system lymphoma in the immunocompetent population based on systemic
chemotherapy (primarily high-dose intravenous methotrexate and steroids) in
association with HAART. The role of WBRT is questionable because of late
neurotoxic effects.
