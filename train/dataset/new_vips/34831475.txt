Approximately 70 million humans worldwide are affected by chronic hepatitis D,
which rapidly leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to
chronic inflammation. The triggers and consequences of this chronic inflammation,
induced by co-infection with the hepatitis D virus (HDV) and the hepatitis B
virus (HBV), are poorly understood. Using CRISPR technology, we characterized the
recognition of HDV mono- and co-infection by intracellular innate immunity and
determined its influence on the viral life cycle and effector T-cell responses
using different HBV and HDV permissive hepatoma cell lines. We showed that HDV
infection is detected by MDA5 and -after a lag phase -induces a profound type I
interferon response in the infected cells. The type I interferon response,
however, was not able to suppress HDV replication or spread, thus providing a
persistent trigger. Using engineered T-cells directed against the envelope
proteins commonly used by HBV and HDV, we found that HDV immune recognition
enhanced T-cell cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the T-cell effector function was
enhanced independently of antigen presentation. These findings help to explain
immune mediated tissue damage in chronic hepatitis D patients and indicate that
combining innate triggers with T-cell activating therapies might allow for a
curative approach.
