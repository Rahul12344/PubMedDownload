Reinterpretation of the Wartburg effect leads to understanding aerobic glycolysis
as a process that provides considerable amount of molecular precursors for the
production of lipids, nucleotides and amino acids that are necessary for
continuous growth and rapid proliferation characteristic for cancer cells. Human 
papilloma virus (HPV) is a number one cause of cervical carcinoma with 99% of the
cervical cancer patients being HPV positive. This tight link between HPV and
cancer raises the question if and how HPV impact cells to reprogram their
metabolism? Focusing on early phase proteins E1, E2, E5, E6 and E7 we demonstrate
that HPV activates plethora of metabolic pathways and directly influences enzymes
of the glycolysis pathway to promote the Warburg effect by increasing glucose
uptake, activating glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, increasing the level
of lactate dehydrogenase A synthesis and inhibiting β-oxidation. Our
considerations lead to conclusion that HPV is substantially involved in metabolic
cell reprogramming toward neoplastic phenotype and its metabolic activity is the 
fundamental reason of its oncogenicity.
