Background: Treatment failure continues to be an impediment to the efficacy of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HART) in the treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (HIV-1). The World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends third-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for patients who have
failed second-line ART. Darunavir (DRV) boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r) has a
higher genetic barrier to resistance, is active against multidrug-resistant HIV
isolates, retaining virological activity even when multiple protease mutations
are present, and has been shown to be cost-effective when compared to other
boosted protease inhibitors (PIs).
Case Summary: This is a case of a 40-year-old female known HIV/AIDS patient who
has been on ART for the last 14 years with good adherence and regular follow-up, 
and who is now on 3rd line ART medication with TLD
(tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir)+DRV/r (in her 11th month) after being
diagnosed with second-line treatment failure. After 6 months and 1 week of
therapy, the viral load (VL) was sent, and the result was undetectable. The
patient's clinical conditions had greatly improved.
Conclusion: Third-line ART therapy, which was once thought to be a salvageable
treatment, is now the primary option for second-line ART failure. TLD in
combination with ritonavir-boosted darunavir is found to be effective at lowering
viral loads in the blood below detectable limits. Despite a lack of data on the
use of third-line ART in Ethiopia, access to third-line ART containing
ritonavir-boosted darunavir is recommended because it has been shown to be an
effective alternative for patients who have failed second-line ART. We recommend 
that more research be done with a larger sample size, and that the findings in
this paper be used with caution.
