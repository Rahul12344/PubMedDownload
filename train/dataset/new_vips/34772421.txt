BACKGROUND: We aimed to comprehensively investigate the optimal cumulative
cisplatin dose during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CC-CCD) for locoregionally
advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CA-LANPC) with different tumor responses after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
METHODS: Patients with CA-LANPC who underwent NAC followed by cisplatin-based
concurrent chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Evaluation of tumor
response in patients was conducted by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid
Tumor (RECIST) 1.1 after two to four cycles NAC. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models were used for prognosis. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was
conducted to classify participates and predict disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two patients with favorable response after NAC
were included. The median CC-CCD was 163 mg/m2 (IQR, 145-194 mg/m2), and
160 mg/m2 was selected as the cutoff point to group patients into low and high
CC-CCD groups (< 160 vs. ≥ 160 mg/m2). There was significant improvement in
5-year DFS (91.2% vs. 72.6%; P = 0.003) for patients receiving high CC-CCD
compared to those receiving low CC-CCD. Multivariate analysis revealed that
CC-CCD, T stage, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA were independent prognostic
factors for DFS (P < 0.05 for all). Patients were further categorized into two
prognostic groups by RPA: the low-risk group (T1-3 disease with regardless of EBV
DNA, and T4 disease with EBV DNA < 4000 copy/mL), and the high-risk group (T4
disease with EBV DNA ≥ 4000 copy/mL). Significant 5-year DFS improvement was
observed for the high-risk group (P = 0.004) with high CC-CCD. However, DFS
improvement was relatively insignificant in the low-risk group (P = 0.073).
CONCLUSIONS: CC-CCD was a positive prognostic factor for responders after NAC in 
CA-LANPC. Furthermore, CC-CCD ≥ 160 mg/m2 could significantly improve DFS in the 
high-risk group with CA-LANPC, but the benefit of high CC-CCD in the low-risk
group needs further study.
