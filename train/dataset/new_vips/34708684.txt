Texas, USA.

We used the incidence of spike gene target failures identified during PCR testing
to provide an early projection of the prevalence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 variant B.1.1.7 in a university setting in Texas, USA,
before sequencing results were available. Findings from a more recent evaluation 
validated those early projections.
