Objective: To examine the results, level of evidence, and methodologic quality of
original studies regarding surgical mask effectiveness in minimizing viral
respiratory illness transmission, and, in particular, the performance of the N95 
respirator versus surgical mask.
Methods: Meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with use of PubMed, 
MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library databases.
Results: Eight studies (9164 participants) were included after screening 153
articles. Analyses showed statistically significant differences between N95
respirator versus surgical mask use to prevent influenza-like-illness (risk ratio
[RR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68-0.94, P < 0.05), non-influenza
respiratory viral infection (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.52-0.74, P < 0.05),
respiratory viral infection (RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.65-0.82, P < 0.05), severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1 and 2 virus infection
(RR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.06-0.49, P < 0.05), and laboratory-confirmed respiratory
viral infection (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.66-0.84, P < 0.05). Analyses did not
indicate statistically significant results against laboratory-confirmed influenza
(RR = 0.87, CI = 0.74-1.03, P > 0.05).
Conclusions: N95 respirator use was associated with fewer viral infectious
episodes for healthcare workers compared with surgical masks. The N95 respirator 
was most effective in reducing the risk of a viral infection in the hospital
setting from the SARS-CoV 1 and 2 viruses compared to the other viruses included 
in this investigation. Methodologic quality, risk of biases, and small number of 
original studies indicate the necessity for further research to be performed,
especially in front-line healthcare delivery settings.
