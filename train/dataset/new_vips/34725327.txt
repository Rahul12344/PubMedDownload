Several COVID-19 vaccines have now been deployed to tackle the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic, most of them based on messenger RNA or adenovirus vectors.The duration 
of protection afforded by these vaccines is unknown, as well as their capacity to
protect from emerging new variants. To provide sufficient coverage for the world 
population, additional strategies need to be tested. The live pediatric measles
vaccine (MV) is an attractive approach, given its extensive safety and efficacy
history, along with its established large-scale manufacturing capacity. We
develop an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized,
membrane-anchored full-length S antigen, which proves to be efficient at
eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell responses and high neutralizing antibody
titers. In both mouse and golden Syrian hamster models, these responses protect
the animals from intranasal infectious challenge. Additionally, the elicited
antibodies efficiently neutralize in vitro the three currently circulating
variants of SARS-CoV-2.
