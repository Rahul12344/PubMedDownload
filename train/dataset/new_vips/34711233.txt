Approximately 30% of individuals with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections also develop
neurological and psychiatric complaints. In rare cases, the occurrence of
autoimmune encephalitis has been reported after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this
systematic review, we have identified eight SARS-CoV-2-associated cases of
anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. All had cerebrospinal fluid antibodies against
the NMDA receptor and a recent onset of working memory deficits, altered mental
status, or psychiatric symptoms, such as confusion, agitation, auditory
hallucination, catatonia and speech dysfunction. All patients received high-dose 
steroid and immunoglobulin therapeutics and conditions improved in each case.
These findings suggest that clinical attention should be paid to warning signs of
autoimmune encephalitis in severe COVID-19 cases. If characteristic features of
autoimmune encephalitis are present, autoantibody diagnostics should be performed
and confirmed cases should be treated with immunotherapy to minimize neurological
impairments.
