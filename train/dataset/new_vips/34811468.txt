Corneal opacities are important causes of blindness, and their major etiology is 
infectious keratitis. Slit-lamp examinations are commonly used to determine the
causative pathogen; however, their diagnostic accuracy is low even for
experienced ophthalmologists. To characterize the "face" of an infected cornea,
we have adapted a deep learning architecture used for facial recognition and
applied it to determine a probability score for a specific pathogen causing
keratitis. To record the diverse features and mitigate the uncertainty, batches
of probability scores of 4 serial images taken from many angles or fluorescence
staining were learned for score and decision level fusion using a gradient
boosting decision tree. A total of 4306 slit-lamp images including 312 images
obtained by internet publications on keratitis by bacteria, fungi, acanthamoeba, 
and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were studied. The created algorithm had a high
overall accuracy of diagnosis, e.g., the accuracy/area under the curve for
acanthamoeba was 97.9%/0.995, bacteria was 90.7%/0.963, fungi was 95.0%/0.975,
and HSV was 92.3%/0.946, by group K-fold validation, and it was robust to even
the low resolution web images. We suggest that our hybrid deep learning-based
algorithm be used as a simple and accurate method for computer-assisted diagnosis
of infectious keratitis.
