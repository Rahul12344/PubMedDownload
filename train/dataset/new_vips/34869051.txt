Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with the highest mortality
rate in the world, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays an important role in its
development. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is highly related to the inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenes in HCC. Researchers have
used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify many noncoding transcripts
related to the development of HCC and have studied the interaction between these 
transcripts and DNA, RNA, or protein to determine the relevant mechanism in the
development of HCC. In general, the research on lncRNA represents a new field of 
cancer research, and the imbalance in lncRNA plays an pivotal role in the
occurrence of liver cancer. In this review, we summarize some of the
dysfunctional lncRNAs in human HCC associated with HBV infection. Their
regulatory pathways, functions, and potential molecular mechanisms in the
occurrence and development of HCC are discussed.
