Acute liver injury (ALI) induced by chemicals or viruses can progress rapidly to 
acute liver failure (ALF), often resulting in death of patients without liver
transplantation. Since liver transplantation is limited due to a paucity of
donors, expensive surgical costs, and severe immune rejection, novel therapies
are required to treat liver injury. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are used for
cellular communication, carrying RNAs, proteins, and lipids and delivering them
intercellularly after being endocytosed by target cells. Recently, it was
reported that EVs secreted from human hepatocytes have an ability to modulate the
immune responses; however, these roles of EVs secreted from human hepatocytes
were studied only with in vitro experiments. In the present study, we evidenced
that EVs secreted from human hepatocytes attenuated the CCL4-induced ALI by
inhibiting the recruitment of monocytes through downregulation of chemokine
receptor in the bone marrow and recruitment of neutrophils through the reduction 
of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and CXCL2 expression levels in the
liver.
