Hemagglutinin (HA), the class I influenza A virus protein is responsible for the 
attachment of virus particles to the cell by binding to glycan receptors,
subsequent virion internalization, and cell entry. Consequently, the importance
of HA makes it a primary target for the development of anti-influenza drugs. The 
natural oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) as well as their derivatives functionalized
with D-mannitol (ORNs-D-M) possess anti-influenza properties in vitro and in vivo
due to interaction with HA receptor sites. This activity suppresses the viral
infection in host cells. In the present work, the complexes of ORNs and ORNs-D-M 
with HA protein were studied by agglutination assay, fluorescence spectroscopy,
as well as molecular docking simulations. Acquired experimental data exhibited a 
decrease in HA titer by 32 times after incubation with the ORNs-D-M for 0.5-24 h.
Quenching fluorescence intensity of the HA suggests that titration by ORNs and
ORNs-D-M probably leads to changes in the HA structure. Detailed structural data 
were obtained with the molecular docking simulations performed for ORNs and
ORNs-D-M ligands containing three and six oligoribonucleotides. The results
reveal that a majority of the ORNs and ORNs-D-M bind in a non-specific way to the
receptor-binding domain of the HA protein. The ligand's affinity to the
hemagglutinin was estimated at the micromolar level. Presented experimental data 
confirmed that both natural ORNs and functionalized ORNs-D-M inhibit the
interactions between HA and glycan receptors and demonstrate anti-influenza
activity.
