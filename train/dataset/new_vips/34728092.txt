INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 infection spread rapidly during
the "first wave" through France between March and May 2020. It was responsible
for high mortality in subjects with comorbidities and the elderly who lived in
nursing homes. In May 2020, 75% of the deaths occurred in people over 75 years
old in nursing homes. It is difficult to estimate accurately the prevalence of
COVID-19 infection during this period because only 50% of the diagnoses in
nursing homes were made by RT-PCR. During this period, the diagnosis was mainly
based on the clinical symptoms.
POPULATION AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective study among residents of the
27 EHPADs in the UNIVI group (SEROCOVID study) between August 31 and October 16, 
2020 using rapid ELISA serotests carried out by pricking the fingertip. We looked
for the seroprevalence by the use of rapid serotests as well as the overall
prevalence by cumulating the positive results of the RT-PCR when done and of the 
rapid serotest. The secondary objectives were the study of risk factors for
infection by multivariate analysis as well as the description of the symptoms
that led to the diagnosis.
RESULTS: In total, 1145 residents were included aged on average 89±7.5 years old 
(female 78.7%). The time between the COVID-19 disease and the rapid inclusion
serotest was on average 5±1.7 months. The prevalence estimated by the three
diagnostic evaluation methods (medical diagnosis, RT-PCR or by rapid serotest
ELISA) is about 14%, underestimated compared to the overall prevalence at 22.7%. 
The study of risk factors in multivariate analysis shows that the most dependent 
residents, living in a protected unit due to behavioral disorders or whose close 
contact with a person with COVID-19 had significantly higher rates of infection. 
Finally, the symptoms most frequently observed in residents differed from those
in younger subjects with geriatric characteristics, such as the higher frequency 
of digestive symptoms and geriatric syndromes. Fever has only been observed in
one third of cases in the elderly. Smell and taste disorders were seldom
described.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides an estimate of the overall prevalence as well as
the mean seroprevalence of COVID-19 in EHPAD residents five months after the
diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The difference between the two estimates is
probably explained by the frailty and decreased immunity of the nursing home
residents. Therefore, it would need to be reactivated by vaccination of all
residents, even those already infected with SARS-COV-2. These elements
corroborate the governmental strategy of vaccination deployed in all residents of
EHPAD regardless of their previous contact with the virus.
