The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic contains a novel
furin cleavage site in the spike protein (S) that increases viral infectivity and
syncytia formation in cells. Here, we show that O-glycosylation near the furin
cleavage site is mediated by members of the GALNT enzyme family, resulting in
decreased furin cleavage and decreased syncytia formation. Moreover, we show that
O-glycosylation is dependent on the novel proline at position 681 (P681).
Mutations of P681 seen in the highly transmissible alpha and delta variants
abrogate O-glycosylation, increase furin cleavage, and increase syncytia
formation. Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S 
are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2
infection. Our results suggest that host O-glycosylation may influence viral
infectivity/tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic
insight into the role of the P681 mutations found in the highly transmissible
alpha and delta variants.
