Highly pathogenic H5Nx avian influenza viruses constantly threaten the poultry
industry and humans and have pandemic potential. These viruses continuously
evolve, requiring a universal vaccine to protect chickens from members of diverse
clades. The purpose of this study was to develop an H5 cleavage-site peptide
vaccine containing polybasic amino acids (RRRK) to completely protect chickens
from H5N6, H5N8, and H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Chickens were immunized with
various doses of a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated H5 cleavage-site
peptide vaccine containing RRRK. The effect of RRRK was evaluated by comparing
the survival rates of chickens immunized with vaccines either containing or
lacking RRRK. The ability of the RRRK-containing vaccine to confer long-term
protective immunity was also assessed. We found that protection was dependent on 
the number of antigens in the vaccine containing RRRK. Chickens immunized
intramuscularly with two doses of 5 μg of the vaccine containing RRRK were
completely protected, but those immunized with fewer than two doses of 3 or 1 μg 
were not protected. Chickens immunized with the vaccine lacking RRRK were not
protected, suggesting the importance of the polybasic amino acids in conferring
immunity. Our results suggest that conserved H5 cleavage-site peptides with
polybasic amino acids may be a potential universal vaccine to protect chickens
from various emerging clades of H5Nx avian influenza viruses.
