BACKGROUND: Nurses are among the frontline healthcare workers directly impacted
by the burden of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study 
aimed to examine the prevalence of emotional distress and the associated factors 
among nurses practicing in South Dakota during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: An online survey was conducted among practicing, licensed nurses in
South Dakota during the pandemic (July 2020 - August 2020). Emotional distress
was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Logistic 
regression models were performed to examine the association of emotional distress
and the three DASS-21 subscales with: sociodemographic and work environment
factors (e.g., work setting, job satisfaction, number of COVID-19 cases seen at
the facility, preparedness, concerns with worsening pre-exiting mental health
conditions due to the pandemic, and contracting the illness).
RESULTS: Among 1505 participants, overall emotional distress was reported by
22.2%, while anxiety, depression and stress were 15.8%, 14.5% and 11.9%,
respectively. Factors associated with moderate to severe emotional distress,
depression, anxiety, and stress were as follows: concerns for worsening of
pre-existing mental health conditions, job dissatisfaction, encountering higher
number of COVID-19 cases at one's work facility, feeling unprepared for the
pandemic, and concern for contracting the illness (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a high prevalence of emotional distress among
nurses and highlights the factors associated with emotional distress during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting appropriate support is imperative to reduce nurses' 
emotional distress and promote psychological well-being during the COVID-19 world
health crisis and in future pandemics.
