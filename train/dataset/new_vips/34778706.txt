Viral pandemic outbreaks cause a significant burden on global health as well as
healthcare expenditure. The use of antiviral agents not only reduces the spread
of viral pathogens but also diminishes the likelihood of them causing infection. 
The antiviral properties of novel copper-silver and copper-zinc intermetallic
nanoparticles against Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2 (RNA virus) and
Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 (DNA virus) are presented. The intermetallic
nanoparticles were spherical in shape and were between 90 and 120 nm. Antiviral
activity was assessed at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 wt/v% for 3 and 
24 h using DNA and RNA virus model organisms. Both types of nanoparticles
demonstrated strong potency towards RNA viruses (> 89% viral reduction), whilst
copper-silver nanoparticles were slightly more toxic towards DNA viruses when
compared to copper-zinc nanoparticles. Both nanoparticles were then incorporated 
into polymeric fibres (carrier) to investigate their antiviral effectiveness when
composited into polymeric matrices. Fibres containing copper-silver nanoparticles
exhibited favourable antiviral properties, with a viral reduction of 75% after
3 h of exposure. The excellent antiviral properties of the intermetallic
nanoparticles reported in this study against both types of viruses together with 
their unique material properties can make them significant alternatives to
conventional antiviral therapies and decontamination agents.
