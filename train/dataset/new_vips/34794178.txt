Little is known regarding COVID-19 vaccination rates in people with HIV (PWH), a 
vulnerable population with significant morbidity from COVID-19. We assessed
COVID-19 vaccination rates among 6952 PWH in the Randomized Trial to Prevent
Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE) compared to region- and country-specific
vaccination data. The global probability of COVID-19 vaccination through the end 
of July 2021 was 55% among REPRIEVE participants with rates varying substantially
by Global Burden of Disease (GBD) super-region. Among PWH, factors associated
with COVID-19 vaccination included residence in high-income regions, age, White
race, male sex, BMI, and higher burden of cardiovascular risk.
