Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a serious public health concern
worldwide. Notably, co-infection with other pathogens may worsen the severity of 
COVID-19 symptoms and increase fatality. Here, we show that co-infection with
influenza A virus (IAV) causes more severe body weight loss and more severe and
prolonged pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Each virus can efficiently
spread in the lungs without interference by the other. However, in
immunohistochemical analyses, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were not detected at the same
sites in the respiratory organs of co-infected hamsters, suggesting that either
the two viruses may have different cell tropisms in vivo or each virus may
inhibit the infection and/or growth of the other within a cell or adjacent areas 
in the organs. Furthermore, a significant increase in IL-6 was detected in the
sera of hamsters co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV at 7 and 10 days
post-infection, suggesting that IL-6 may be involved in the increased severity of
pneumonia. Our results strongly suggest that IAV co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 can
have serious health risks and increased caution should be applied in such cases.
