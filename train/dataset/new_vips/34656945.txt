The species Keterah orthonairovirus is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus. Few
studies have focused on this species, and there remains no treatment for
Issyk-Kul fever, an infectious disease caused by a Keterah orthonairovirus. This 
study was performed to characterize this species using two viruses, Issyk-Kul
virus (ISKV) and Soft tick bunyavirus (STBV), in cell culture and type I
interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice and to evaluate the efficacy of
serum transfusion using a mouse model of ISKV infection. The two viruses
replicated in many kinds of mammal- and tick-derived cell lines but showed few
different characteristics in tropism and antigenicity against anti-viral sera in 
cell culture. Neither virus caused clinical signs in wild-type mice, but both
caused lethal infection in IFNAR-/- mice. ISKV caused more acute death than STBV 
in IFNAR-/- mice. In both viral infections in IFNAR-/- mice, macroscopic
abnormalities were prominent in the liver. Similar levels of viral genome between
ISKV- and STBV-infected IFNAR-/- mice were observed in blood, liver, lymphoid
tissues and adrenal gland at moribund stages. Hematologic abnormalities in
IFNAR-/- mice infected with these viruses, including leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia, and biochemical abnormalities indicating liver damage were
prominent. In addition, blood levels of many kinds of cytokines and chemokines
such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
factor-α, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 were elevated. ISKV-immunized serum transfusion after infection delayed
the time to death of IFNAR-/- mice. Thus, the present study showed that the
species Keterah orthonairovirus could proliferate in most mammal-derived cell
lines and cause severe liver lesions and death in IFNAR-/- mice and that serum
transfusion might be effective in treatment against Issyk-Kul fever.
