Simulation has played a critical role in medicine for decades as a pedagogical
and assessment tool. The labor and delivery unit provides an ideal setting for
the use of simulation technology. Prior reviews of this topic have focused on
simulation for individual and team training and assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic
has provided an opportunity for educators and leaders in obstetric anesthesiology
to rapidly train health care providers and develop new protocols for patient care
with simulation. This review surveys new developments in simulation for obstetric
anesthesiology with an emphasis on simulation use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
