Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is correlated with cerebrovascular and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to assess the effect of treatment 
with DAAs on vascular endothelial function in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCV
infected patients without any CVD risk factors. Fifty chronic HCV genotype 4
infected patients, without cardiovascular risks who have been listed to receive
sofosbuvir/daclatasvir with ribavirin combination as triple therapy for 3 months 
were prospectively recruited. Endothelial dysfunction markers as soluble vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and Von willebrand factor (vWf) and
inflammation marker (IL6) were estimated at baseline and 3 months post the end of
therapy (SVR). All patients achieved SVR. VCAM1 level was significantly improved 
after HCV clearance with DAA in cirrhotic HCV patients (P = 0.002) compared to
patients with mild liver fibrosis (P = 0.006). Levels of vWF also decreased
significantly in cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis groups after SVR (P < 0.001 and
P = 0.011, respectively). Systemic inflammatory marker (IL6) showed significant
decrease in cirrhotic patients (P = 0.001). While, IL6 level did not change
significantly in non-cirrhotic group (P = 0.061). Also at SVR, noninvasive liver 
fibrosis indices have been reduced significantly in the two groups (P < 0.001).
HCV clearance by new DAA treatment improves the vascular endothelial dysfunction 
in Egyptian HCV infected patients with different levels of liver fibrosis and
with no risk factors for endothelial dysfunction or CVD.
