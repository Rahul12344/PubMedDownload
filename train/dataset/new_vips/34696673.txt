INTRODUCTION: In daily practice management of psoriasis, evaluation of risk
factors for infections is having a growing influence. Indeed, in psoriatic
patients, risk of infections may be due to psoriasis itself, immunomodulatory
therapy, and comorbidities that may increase this risk and patient
hospitalization.
AREAS COVERED: Given the greater understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis and the 
increasing number of treatment options, it is particularly important to customize
therapy according to each, single patient; psoriasis features and comorbidities
are also essential to tailor treatment goals.
EXPERT OPINION: In this perspective, the current knowledge on the infectious risk
in psoriatic patient, related to comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary, to 'special
populations,' to chronic infections, such as latent tuberculosis, chronic
hepatitis B and C, and HIV, and to the most recent Covid-19 pandemic scenario, is
reviewed and discussed in order to suggest the most appropriate approach and
achieve the best available therapeutic option.
