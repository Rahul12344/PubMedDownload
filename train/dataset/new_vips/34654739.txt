The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 100 million infections and millions of deaths. 
Effective vaccines remain the best hope of curtailing SARS-CoV-2 transmission,
morbidity, and mortality. The vaccines in current use require cold storage and
sophisticated manufacturing capacity, which complicates their distribution,
especially in less developed countries. We report the development of a candidate 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that is purely protein based and directly targets
antigen-presenting cells. It consists of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding
domain (SpikeRBD) fused to an alpaca-derived nanobody that recognizes class II
major histocompatibility complex antigens (VHHMHCII). This vaccine elicits robust
humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Both young and
aged mice immunized with two doses of VHHMHCII-SpikeRBD elicit high-titer binding
and neutralizing antibodies. Immunization also induces strong cellular immunity, 
including a robust CD8 T cell response. VHHMHCII-SpikeRBD is stable for at least 
7 d at room temperature and can be lyophilized without loss of efficacy.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interest statement: N.P., T.J.H., and
H.L.P. have filed a patent with the Boston Children’s Hospital for the use of
nanobody conjugates as immunomodulatory vaccines. P.W.R. and S.P.J.W. have filed 
a patent with Washington University for VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. S.P.J.W 
has received unrelated funding support in sponsored research agreements with Vir 
Biotechnology, AbbVie, and sAB therapeutics.
