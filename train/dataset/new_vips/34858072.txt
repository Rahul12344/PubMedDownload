Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the result of infection by the SARS-CoV-2
virus, has caused a global pandemic. To respond to this outbreak rapidly and
properly, clinical pharmacists in Shanghai Children's Hospital carried out
innovative measures based on previous artificial intelligence experiences, such
as using service robots for contactless drug delivery between Fever Clinic and
Pharmacy Storage, providing telemedicine counseling on specific platforms and
offering multimedia health education. With good control of the pandemic in
Shanghai, these contactless services have been retained and expanded at the
patients' request. The aim of this article is to share our strategies and efforts
with peers who are fighting against COVID-19 in other countries and regions.
