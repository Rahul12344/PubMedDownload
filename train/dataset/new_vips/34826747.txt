BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a virus that is spread by aerosol which can cause
worsening of hypoxia and bronchoscopy procedures in COVID-19 patients may be
considered.
METHOD: The design of this study is a case series reported using the Preferred
Reporting of Case Series in Surgery (PROCESS) 2020 Guideline. Data collection was
carried out in the period January-April 2021. All participants underwent X-ray
examination and blood gas analysis as well as signs of infection before and after
bronchoscopy.
RESULT: Three intubated patients with COVID-19 were confirmed from PCR
nasopharyngeal swab present with worsening on chest X-ray. All three patients had
a normal bronchial wall with some inflammation and thick mucus resulting in lung 
atelectasis and massive inhomogeneous opacity on chest X-ray. Patients showed
improvement on chest X-ray after bronchoscopy intervention.
CONCLUSION: The bronchoscopy procedure can improve the lung function of COVID-19 
patients and if it is carried out by medical personnel who pay attention to
universal precautions, it will minimize the occurrence of transmission.
