Ensemble refinement, the application of molecular dynamics to crystallographic
refinement, explicitly models the disorder inherent in macromolecular structures.
These ensemble models have been shown to produce more accurate structures than
traditional single-model structures. However, suboptimal sampling of the
molecular-dynamics simulation and modelling of crystallographic disorder has
limited the utility of the method, and can lead to unphysical and strained
models. Here, two improvements to the ensemble refinement method implemented
within Phenix are presented: DEN restraints, which guide the local sampling of
conformations and allow a more robust exploration of local conformational
landscapes, and ECHT disorder models, which allow the selection of more
physically meaningful and effective disorder models for parameterizing the
continuous disorder components within a crystal. These improvements lead to more 
consistent and physically interpretable simulations of macromolecules in
crystals, and allow structural heterogeneity and disorder to be systematically
explored on different scales. The new approach is demonstrated on several case
studies and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and demonstrates how the choice of
disorder model affects the type of disorder that is sampled by the restrained
molecular-dynamics simulation.
