The ongoing global administration of vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) means that increasing numbers of patients are likely to present with
post-vaccination complications. We describe the first reported case of neuralgic 
amyotrophy (NA) involving the lumbosacral plexus occurring after AstraZeneca
COVID-19 vaccination. The patient presented with acute-onset leg paralysis
following administration of the vaccine. Based on the clinical,
electrodiagnostic, and radiologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with
post-vaccination NA. We speculate that the COVID-19 vaccine elicited an
immune-mediated inflammatory response to the injected antigen due to inflammatory
immunity in a patient with predisposed susceptibility to NA.
