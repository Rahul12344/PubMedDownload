BACKGROUND: Older adults duo to circumstances of aging such as relationship
losses, medical morbidities, and functional declines, are prone to social
isolation and loneliness more than any other age group. Furthermore, with The
recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to quarantine, the
possibility of feelings of loneliness, especially in older adults, became an
important nursing priority. Therefore, it is important to quickly identify
loneliness and respond appropriately to prevent, reduce, or treat it. The aim of 
this study was to translate the De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale into Persian
for older adults.
METHODS: The sample was 400 adults aged 65 and older with a mean age of 71.32
(SD= ± 6.09) years. Recruitment and data collection was done via online methods. 
The original scale was translated into Persian using the World Health
Organization (WHO) protocol of forward-backward translation technique. Face
validity and content validity; was followed by exploratory and confirmatory
factor analysis. Lastly, reliability was assessed using the Average Inter-Item
Correlation, Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's Omega.
RESULTS: The results showed that the Persian version of the loneliness scale had 
two factors namely social loneliness (5 items) and emotional loneliness (3 items)
and the combined score explained 45.66% of the total variance of this scale. In
addition, all goodness of fit indices confirmed a two factors model fit and all
of the reliability indices were excellent.
CONCLUSIONS: The Persian version of the loneliness scale is useful and suitable
for detecting social loneliness and emotional loneliness in older Iranian adults.
