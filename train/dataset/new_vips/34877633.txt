AIMS: Lockdown and restricted mobility due to the pandemic of corona virus
disease  2019 (COVID-19) has severely affected the continuity of healthcare of
patients with acute and chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on 
the adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD), symptom control, and quality of
life (QOL) in patients with celiac disease (CeD).
METHODS: A questionnaire, consisting of both ad-hoc and validated questions, was 
created after review of literature, group discussions, and expert meetings.
Standardized questionnaires namely CeD adherence test (CDAT), celiac symptom
index score, and CeD-related QOL were used. The web-based questionnaire was sent 
to 3130 patients via social media and 452 responses (14.4%) were received. Also, 
additional 68 patients (not available on any social media application) were
interviewed telephonically by a trained dietitian.
RESULTS: Overall, 505 patients (females: 318; mean age: 24.1±14.2 years) were
included. While only 6.7% (n = 34) had poor compliance to GFD (CDAT > 17) before 
COVID-19 pandemic, it almost doubled to 12.6% (n = 64) during the COVID-19
pandemic times (p = 0.02). Furthermore, 4.9% (n = 25) of patients were diagnosed 
contacting  COVID-19. Interestingly, 73.2% (n = 370) patients preferred online
appointment than physical appointment. Most common difficulties faced during
lockdown period were high delivery charges for getting gluten-free (GF) food at
home (54.4%), increased prices of regular GF food (43.1%), and travelling long
distance to arrange GF food (44.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the adherence,
symptom control, and QOL in patients with CeD, attributable to unavailability,
shortage of money, and heightened cost of GF food. The pandemic has offered an
opportunity to practice teleconsultation approach for patients with CeD.
