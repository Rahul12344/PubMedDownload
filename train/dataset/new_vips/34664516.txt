Hepatitis C Through Graphic Narratives.

This article describes a process of creating an ethnographic comic about
injection drug use and hepatitis C, based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in 
Norway. The project and the graphic publication titled The Virus were a
collaboration between a social anthropologist, a graphic artist, and individuals 
who inject illegal drugs and are aimed at reducing bodily, social, and narrative 
harms related to drug use. The article argues that structurally informed
interventions, such as this project, which account for the social, economic, and 
epistemological inequalities, benefit from taking phenomenological perspectives
seriously. In our case, that attitude meant including participants' positive
associations with their current or former heroin and injecting drug usage, their 
stigmatized desires, and their emotions-such as love-related to the disease. The 
article describes the narrative, conceptual, aesthetic, and practical choices
encountered in making The Virus to confront the dominant, authorized narratives
in the field of drug use and hepatitis C. We sought to make choices that
ultimately would not contribute to the (re)production of the very object of the
prevention-stigma related to hepatitis C-but instead would create a new
narrative(s) that forged a sense of purpose, recognition, and humanity.
