Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) are metrics commonly reported to compare
absolute VE (aVE) of two vaccine products. Estimates of rVE for enhanced
influenza vaccines (eIV) vs. standard inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) have
been assessed across different seasons, influenza-specific endpoints, and
nonspecific endpoints (e.g., all-cause cardiovascular hospitalizations). To
illustrate the challenges of comparability across studies, we conducted a
scenario analysis to evaluate the effects of varying absolute VE (aVE) of IIV
(i.e., as compared with placebo) on the interpretation of rVE of eIV vs IIV. We
show that estimates of rVE might not be comparable across studies because
additional benefits commensurate with a given estimate of rVE are dependent on
the aVE for the comparator vaccine, which can depend on factors such as host
response to vaccine, virus type, and clinical endpoint evaluated. These findings 
have implications for interpretation of rVE across studies and for sample size
considerations in future trials.
