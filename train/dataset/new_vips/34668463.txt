Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health threat. The World
Health Organization (WHO) established a goal to eliminate HBV infection as a
public health threat by 2030, and defined targets for key interventions to
achieve that goal. We evaluated HBV burden and relevant national recommendations 
for progress towards WHO targets in circumpolar countries. Viral hepatitis
experts of circumpolar countries were surveyed regarding their country's burden
of HBV, achievement of WHO targets and national public health authority
recommendations for HBV prevention and control. Eight of nine circumpolar
countries responded. All countries continue to see new HBV infections. Data about
HBV prevalence and progress in reaching WHO 2030 elimination targets are lacking.
No country was able to report data for all seven WHO target measures. All
countries have recommendations targeting the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission. Only the USA and Greenland recommend universal birth dose
vaccination. Four countries have recommendations to screen persons at high risk
for HBV. Existing recommendations largely address prevention; however,
recommendations for universal birth dose vaccination have not been widely
introduced. Opportunities remain for the development of trackable targets and
national elimination planning to screen and treat for HBV to reduce incidence and
mortality.
