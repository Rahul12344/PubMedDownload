BACKGROUND: Integrin αvβ3 is a cell membrane structural protein whose
extracellular domain contains a receptor for L-thyroxine (T4). The integrin is
expressed in rapidly dividing cells and its internalization is prompted by T4.
The protein binds viruses and we have raised the possibility elsewhere that
action of free T4 (FT4)-when he latter is increased in the nonthyroidal illness
syndrome (NTIS) known to complicate COVID-19 infecction-may enhance cellular
uptke of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor.
OBJECTIVE: Because T4 also acts nongenomically via the integrin to promote
platelet aggregation and angiogenesis, we suggest here that T4 may contribute to 
the coagulopathy and endothelial abnormalities that can develop in COVID-19
infections, particularly when the lung is primary affected.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Elevated FT4 has been described in the NTIS of
COVID-19 patients and may be associated with increased illness severity, but the 
finding of FT4 elevation is inconsistent in the NTIS literature. Circulating
3,5',3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (reverse T3, rT3) are frequently elevated in NTIS.
Thought to be biologically inactive, rT3in fact stimulates cancer cell
proliferation via avb3 and also may increase actin polymerization. We propose
here that rT3 in the NTIS complicating systemic COVIF-19 infection may support
coagulation and disordered blood vessel formation via actin polymerization.
