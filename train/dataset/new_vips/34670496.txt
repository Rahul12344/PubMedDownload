BACKGROUND: Worldwide, restrictive measures have been taken to manage the spread 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing and self-isolation have considerably 
affected the lives of people with dementia and their informal caregivers. The
purpose of the study was to explore the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as 
experienced by the spouses of home-dwelling people with dementia in Norway.
METHODS: The study had a qualitative descriptive design using individual
telephone interviews for data collection. A total sample of 17 spouses of people 
with dementia were included, 14 women and three men ages 52 to 82 years. A
qualitative content analysis following six steps inspired by Graneheim and
Lundman was used to identify the categories presented.
RESULTS: The participants emphasized four main perspectives: 1) Radical changes
in available services, 2) Restrictions changed everyday life, 3) Impacts on
health and well-being, and 4) Actions that made life easier. The participants
also described how positive activities and easily accessible services helped them
in this situation.
CONCLUSIONS: The governmental restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in
radical changes in available services with severe consequences for the lives and 
well-being of home-dwelling people with dementia and their spouses. Examples of
coping strategies and possible psychosocial interventions compatible with virus
precautions were identified. The potential of such interventions should be
further explored to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in situations like a
pandemic.
