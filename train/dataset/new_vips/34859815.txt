Apoptosis is an important cellular response to viral infection. In current study,
we identified activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy protein 1
(AMBRA1) as a positive regulator of apoptosis triggered by dsRNA. Depletion of
AMBRA1 by gene editing significantly reduced dsRNA-induced apoptosis, which was
largely restored by trans-complementation of AMBRA1. Mechanistically, AMBRA1
interacts with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), a key
mitochondrial adaptor in the apoptosis pathway induced by dsRNA and viral
infection. Further Co-IP analysis demonstrated that the mitochondrial
localization of MAVS was essential for their interaction. The impact of AMBRA1 on
dsRNA-induced apoptosis relied on the presence of MAVS and caspase-8. AMBRA1 was 
involved in the stabilization of MAVS through preventing its proteasomal
degradation induced by dsRNA. Consistently, AMBRA1 upregulated the apoptosis
induced by Semliki Forest virus infection. Taken together, our work illustrated a
role of AMBRA1 in the virus-induced apoptosis through interacting with and
stabilizing MAVS.
