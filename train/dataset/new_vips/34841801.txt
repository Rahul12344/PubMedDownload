Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are formed by self-assembly of metal ions or
clusters with organic ligands, and are widely used in the fields of catalysis,
sensing, energy and biomedicine. Recently, biological composites based on MOFs
have attracted increasing attention. MOFs can be used as a platform for
encapsulating bioactive substances due to the advantages such as large pore
capacity, large specific surface area and diverse structure composition. These
features can protect bioactive substances from adverse conditions, e.g. high
temperature, high pressure, and organic solvents, thus improving the
anti-adversity of bioactive substances. This review summarizes the advances of
using MOFs as protective coatings to improve the anti-adversity of different
bioactive substances, and introduces the synthesis strategy of MOFs-based
biological composites, with the aim to promote the practical application of
MOFs-based biological composites.
