While cold chain management has been part of healthcare systems, enabling the
efficient administration of vaccines in both urban and rural areas, the COVID-19 
virus has created entirely new challenges for vaccine distributions. With
virtually every individual worldwide being impacted, strategies are needed to
devise best vaccine distribution scenarios, ensuring proper storage,
transportation and cost considerations. Current models do not consider the
magnitude of distribution efforts needed in our current pandemic, in particular
the objective that entire populations need to be vaccinated. We expand on
existing models and devise an approach that considers the needed extensive
distribution capabilities and special storage requirements of vaccines, while at 
the same time being cognizant of costs. As such, we provide decision support on
how to distribute the vaccine to an entire population based on priority. We do so
by conducting predictive analysis for three different scenarios and dividing the 
distribution chain into three phases. As the available vaccine doses are limited 
in quantity at first, we apply decision tree analysis to find the best
vaccination scenario, followed by a synthetic control analysis to predict the
impact of the vaccination programme to forecast future vaccine production. We
then formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for locating and
allocating cold storage facilities for bulk vaccine production, followed by the
proposition of a heuristic algorithm to solve the associated objective functions.
The application of the proposed model is evaluated by implementing it in a
real-world case study. The optimized numerical results provide valuable decision 
support for healthcare authorities.
