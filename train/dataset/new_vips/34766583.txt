RATIONALE: Liver function monitoring is recommended when agomelatine is
prescribed, although liver enzymes are not considered predictive biomarkers. Most
patients present with acute liver injury, with only a few presenting with levels 
of liver enzymes that are over 30 times the upper limit of normal. The
patient-specific risk factors that are associated with liver injury remain
unclear. Thus, this report provides new insights into the mechanism of
agomelatine-induced acute hepatocellular injury based on cytochrome P450 family 1
subfamily A member 2 (CYP1A2) polymorphism.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a case of acute hepatocellular injury in a
75-year-old man who was taking agomelatine at a dose of 50 mg/qn. All hepatitis
virus test results were negative. No history of liver disease was observed. As
CYP1A2 is the main metabolic enzyme of agomelatine, CYP1A2 AA (rs762551) genetic 
polymorphism was analyzed.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient's transaminases level exceeded the critical value on day
72 after starting oral agomelatine.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient received intravenous magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate, a
liver cell-protecting agent, followed by the withdrawal of agomelatine.
OUTCOMES: There was an improvement in the levels of the liver enzymes and no
subsequent organ dysfunction was observed.
LESSONS: Here, we report a case of acute hepatocellular injury characterized by a
very high aspartate aminotransferase level. Periodic liver function testing
throughout the treatment period can help in the rapid and appropriate diagnosis
of acute liver injury, particularly in the absence of typical clinical
manifestations. Agomelatine hepatic toxicity might be related to an idiosyncratic
metabolic reaction that depends on individual patient differences. As it is the
main metabolic enzyme of agomelatine, CYP1A2 genetic polymorphism may contribute 
to liver injury by affecting its metabolites.
