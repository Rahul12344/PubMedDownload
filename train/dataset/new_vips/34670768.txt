OBJECTIVES: There are numerous reports on the psychological burden of medical
workers after the COVID-19 outbreak; however, no study has examined the influence
of developmental characteristics on the mental health of medical workers. The
objective of this study was to examine whether the developmental characteristics 
of medical workers are associated with anxiety and depression after the COVID-19 
outbreak.
DESIGN: We conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey in October
2020.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The data of 640 medical workers were analysed. The
questionnaire included items on sociodemographic data, changes in their life
after the COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of depression, anxiety,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits and autism spectrum
disorder traits.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Depression symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Generalised Anxiety
Disorder-7. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed 
to test the effects of developmental characteristics on depression and anxiety
symptoms after controlling for sociodemographic factors and changes in
participants' lives after the COVID-19 outbreak.
RESULTS: Increases in physical and psychological burden were observed in 49.1%
and 78.3% of the subjects, respectively. The results of a multiple regression
analysis showed that ADHD traits were significantly associated with both
depression (β=0.390, p<0.001) and anxiety (β=0.426, p<0.001). Autistic traits
were significantly associated with depression (β=0.069, p<0.05) but not anxiety. 
Increased physical and psychological burden, being female, medical workers other 
than physicians and nurses, fear of COVID-19 and experience of discrimination
were also significantly associated with both depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSION: Globally, the burden on medical workers increased. This study
suggested that medical workers with higher ADHD traits may need special attention
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
