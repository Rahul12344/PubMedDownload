Background/objective: Our objective was to assess the impact of mass mailing and 
the inclusion of Best Practice Advisory (BPA) "Pop-Up" tool in the electronic
medical record (EMR) on HCV screening rates.
Methods: Between June 2015 and March 2020, two interventions were developed for
primary care physicians (PCP). An educational letter along with a blood
requisition form, signed on behalf of the PCPs, was sent to patients. We also
developed a BPA "Pop-Up" screening tool to alert PCPs to order HCV screening
tests on patients with no previous screening. Data were collected and analyzed
prospectively.
Results: When we started the screening program in June 2015, 33,736 baby boomers 
were eligible for screening, and the hospital system added an additional 26,027
baby boomers between June 2015 and March 2020. Of the 89 primary care providers
employed by the hospital, 75 agreed to participate at different time periods. We 
screened 23,291 (43.5%) of 53,526 eligible patients during study period. Of
these, 399 (1.7%) had HCV antibody, but HCV RNA was positive in only 195 (1%).
HCV antibody positivity rates were higher in men, blacks, and in 1951-1960 birth 
cohorts. Spontaneous clearance rates appeared to be lower in men (OR 0.59, 95% CI
0.39-0.90, P = 0.015) and in blacks (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20-0.50, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Although a formal screening program increased screening rates for HCV
among baby boomers, about 50% of baby boomers remained unscreened. In this
community screening program, we found that men and blacks are less likely to have
spontaneous HCV clearance.
