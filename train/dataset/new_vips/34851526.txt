BACKGROUND: To provide information about pathogens' coinfection prevalence with
SARS-CoV-2 could be a real help to save patients' lives. This study aims to
evaluate the pathogens' coinfection prevalence among COVID-19 patients.
METHOD: In order to find all of the relevant articles, we used systematic search 
approach. Research-based databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and 
Scopus, without language restrictions, were searched to identify the relevant
bacterial, fungal, and viral coinfections among COVID-19 cases from December 1,
2019, to August 23, 2021. In order to dig deeper, other scientific repositories
such as Medrxiv were probed.
RESULTS: A total of 13,023 studies were found through systematic search. After
thorough analysis, only 64 studies with 61,547 patients were included in the
study. The most common causative agents of coinfection among COVID-19 patients
were bacteria (pooled prevalence: 20.97%; 95% CI: 15.95-26.46; I2 : 99.9%) and
less frequent were virus coinfections (pooled prevalence: 12.58%; 95% CI:
7.31-18.96; I2 : 98.7%). The pooled prevalence of fungal coinfections was also
12.60% (95% CI: 7.84-17.36; I2 : 98.3%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the
age sample size and WHO geographic region did not influenced heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: We identified a high prevalence of pathogenic microorganism
coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Because of this rate of coinfection
empirical use of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral treatment are advisable
specifically at the early stage of COVID-19 infection. We also suggest running
simultaneously diagnostic tests to identify other microbiological agents'
coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.
