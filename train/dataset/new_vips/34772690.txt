The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a range of economic shocks, food systems
shocks, public health crises and political upheavals across the globe, prompting 
a rethink of associated global systems. Prepandemic anticolonial movements that
challenged hierarchies of race, space, gender and expert knowledge in global
health took on new meaning in the context of the unequal impacts of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus as it moved through different kinds of spaces and distinct
political contexts. In light of these dynamics, and the desire of many current
practitioners in global health to reimagine the future, the need for critical
analyses of the recent past have become more urgent. Here we challenge linear
understandings of progress in global health-with a focus on the field of
nutrition-by returning to consider a previous cycle of dramatic social, political
and economic change that prompted serious challenges to the dominance of Western 
powers and US-based philanthro-capitalists. With a 'global' health and nutrition 
audience in mind, we put forward considerations on why a better understanding of 
the continuities and divergences between this past and the present moment are
necessary to challenge a status quo that was, and is, highly flawed.
