As COVID-19 escalated globally in 2020, mandated suspension of dine-in services
was instilled to control virus transmission. Restaurants lost billions of
dollars, millions experienced severe employment changes, and numerous small
restaurants closed. For those remaining in business, converting to online food
ordering was essential. Unique to the food ordering setting, this study extended 
the Stimulus-Organism-Response model to predict the purchase intentions of
participants in an online food ordering context. Using structural equation
modeling, this study discovered the indirect effects of the menu's visual appeal 
and informativeness, and the perception of COVID-19 risks on consumer purchase
intentions. This causal relationship was significantly mediated by consumers'
desire for food and their perceived convenience of online food ordering. Through 
providing theoretical and managerial implications for how to identify appropriate
products, utilize content marketing effectively, and attract new customers, this 
study could assist restaurants in adapting to remaining competitive, even post
COVID-19.
