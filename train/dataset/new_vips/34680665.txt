Insects have a highly sensitive sense of smell, allowing them to perform complex 
behaviors, such as foraging and peer recognition. Their sense of smell is based
on the recognition of ligands and is mainly coordinated by odorant-binding
proteins (OBPs). In Apis mellifera, behavior can be affected by different
pathogens, including deformed wing virus (DWV) and its variants. In particular,
it has been shown that variant A of DWV (DWV-A) is capable of altering the
ultra-cellular structure associated with olfactory activity. In this study was
evaluated olfactory sensitivity and the expression of OBP genes in honey bees
inoculated with DWV-A. Electroantennographic analyses (EAG) were carried out to
determine the olfactory sensitivity to the essential oils Eucalyptus globulus and
Mentha piperita. The expression of nine antenna-specific OBP genes and DWV-A load
in inoculated bees was also quantified by qPCR. We observed an inverse
relationship between viral load and olfactory sensitivity and the expression of
some OBP proteins. Thus, high viral loads reduced olfactory sensitivity to
essential oils and the gene expression of the OBP2, OBP5, OBP11, and OBP12
proteins on the antennas of middle- and forager-age bees. These results suggest
that DWV-A could have negative effects on the processes of aroma perception by
worker bees, affecting their performance in tasks carried out in and outside the 
colony.
