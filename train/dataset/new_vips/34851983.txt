BACKGROUND: A previous review on hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence in 2005
categorized Southeast Asia as a low HAV endemicity region. In 2010, the World
Health Organization modified this from low to low/medium endemicity, pointing out
that these estimates were based on limited evidence. Since then, there has been
no attempt to review HAV epidemiology from this region. We conducted a systematic
review of literature to collect information on HAV incidence and seroprevalence
in select countries in the Southeast Asian region, specifically, The Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations over the last 20 years.
METHODOLOGY: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. From the
relevant articles, we extracted data and conducted a risk of bias assessment of
individual studies.
RESULTS: The search yielded 22 and 13 publications on HAV seroprevalence and
incidence, respectively. Overall, our findings point to a very low HAV endemicity
profile in Thailand and Singapore and evidence of a shift towards low HAV
endemicity in Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Vietnam. Only Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines
have existing HAV disease surveillance and reported incidence rates below 1 per
100,000. Several outbreaks with varying magnitude documented in the region
provide insights into the evolving epidemiology of HAV in the region. Risk of
bias assessment of studies revealed that the individual studies were of low to
medium risk.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The available HAV endemicity profiles in Southeast
Asian countries, aside from Thailand, are limited and outdated, but suggest an
endemicity shift in the region that is not fully documented yet. These findings
highlight the need to update information on HAV epidemiology through
strengthening of disease surveillance mechanisms to confirm the shift in HAV
endemicity in the region.
