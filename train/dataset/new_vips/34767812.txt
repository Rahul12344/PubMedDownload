To catalyze severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
research, including development of novel interventive and preventive strategies, 
we characterized progression of disease in depth in a robust coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) animal model. In this model, male and female golden Syrian
hamsters were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. Groups of
inoculated and mock-inoculated uninfected control animals were euthanized at 2,
4, 7, 14, and 28 days after inoculation to track multiple clinical, pathology,
virology, and immunology outcomes. SARS-CoV-2-inoculated animals consistently
lost body weight during the first week of infection, had higher lung weights at
terminal time points, and developed lung consolidation per histopathology and
quantitative image analysis measurements. High levels of infectious virus and
viral RNA were reliably present in the respiratory tract at days 2 and 4 after
inoculation, corresponding with widespread necrosis and inflammation. At day 7,
when infectious virus was rare, interstitial and alveolar macrophage infiltrates 
and marked reparative epithelial responses (type II hyperplasia) dominated in the
lung. These lesions resolved over time, with only residual epithelial repair
evident by day 28 after inoculation. The use of quantitative approaches to
measure cellular and morphologic alterations in the lung provides valuable
outcome measures for developing therapeutic and preventive interventions for
COVID-19 using the hamster COVID-19 model.
