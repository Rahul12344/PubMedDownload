Background: Associated with abnormal angiogenesis and disc dysfunction, lumbar
disc degeneration (LDD) appears to be an important disease suffered by elderly
people. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of insufficient
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and excessive vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) in the development and progression of LDD, though a practical
therapeutic strategy is lacking.
Methods: The expression of IGF1 and VEGF was assessed in LDD specimens compared
to normal disc tissue as a control. A gene therapy approach was performed, in
which an adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying both IGF1 and shVEGF
(AAV-IGF1/shVEGF) was orthotopically injected to the rats that had undergone LDD.
The alterations in IGF1 and VEGF levels in the treated disc tissue were confirmed
by immunohistochemistry. The outcome of this therapy was assessed by disc cell
death using an annexin V-FITC assay and by assessing lumbar proteoglycan and
collagen II levels using ELISA.
Results: IGF1 expression was significantly downregulated in LDD, while VEGF
expression was significantly upregulated in LDD, compared to normal controls.
Combined AAV-IGF1/shVEGF treatment simultaneously corrected the insufficient IGF1
and the excessive VEGF in LDD rats. Moreover, AAV-IGF1/shVEGF significantly
reduced disc cell death in the vertebral pulp and annulus fibrosus and
significantly enhanced the lumbar proteoglycan and collagen II levels.
Conclusions: The simultaneous increase in IGF1 and depletion of VEGF effectively 
prevented the development of LDD, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic
approach for LDD which is clinically translatable.
