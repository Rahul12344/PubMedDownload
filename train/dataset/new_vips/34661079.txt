The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain family of proteins, which include
its prototypical member Brd4, is implicated in a variety of cancers and viral
infections due to their interaction with cellular and viral proteins. BET
proteins contain two bromodomains, a common protein motif that selectively binds 
acetylated lysine on histones. However, they are structurally distinct from other
bromodomain-containing proteins because they encode a unique C-terminal
extra-terminal (ET) domain that is important for the protein-protein interactions
including jumonji C-domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) and histone-lysine
N-methyltransferase NSD3 (NSD3). Brd4 functions primarily during transcription as
a passive scaffold linking cellular and viral proteins to chromatin. The rapid
development of clinical inhibitors targeting Brd4 highlights the importance of
this protein as an anticancer target. Current therapeutic approaches focus on the
development of small molecule acetylated lysine mimics of histone marks that
block the ability of the bromodomains to bind their chromatin marks. Thus far,
bromodomain-targeted agents have shown dose-limiting toxicities due to off-target
effects on other bromodomain-containing proteins. Here, we exploited a viral-host
protein interaction interface to design peptides for the disruption of BET
protein function. A murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrase-derived peptide (ET
binding motif, EBM) and its shorter minimal binding motif (pentapeptide LKIRL)
were sufficient to directly bind the Brd4 ET domain and reduce cellular
proliferation of an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Using computational and
biochemical approaches, we identified the minimal essential contacts between EBM 
and LKIRL peptides and the Brd4 ET domain. Our findings provide a structural
foundation for inhibiting BET/Brd4-mediated cancers by targeting the ET domain
with small peptide-based inhibitors.
