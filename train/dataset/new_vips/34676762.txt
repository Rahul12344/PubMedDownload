RNA viral vectors that replicate without DNA intermediates are attractive
platforms for manipulation of cells for biomedical and veterinary applications
because they have minimal risk of chromosomal integration. Vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) vectors are among the most well-studied RNA viral vectors due to
their low pathogenicity to humans and ability to express transgenes at high
levels for weeks to months. However, their applications have been mostly limited 
to oncolytic and vaccine vectors due to their cytopathogenicity. We discovered
two mutations in the VSV vector that synergistically confer improved stability in
mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with markedly lower cytopathic effects. We also
demonstrated chemical regulation of transgene expression through embedded
riboswitches. The ESCs infected with the mutant vector were shown to maintain
pluripotency. This new vector sets the stage for precise regulation of gene
expression in ESCs to produce a variety of differentiated cells without
chromosomal alteration.
