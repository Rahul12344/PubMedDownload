A wide range of neurological manifestations have been associated with the
development of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the etiology of 
the neurological symptomatology is still largely unexplored. Here, we used
state-of-the-art multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n = 6 COVID-19,
median age = 69.5 years; n = 7 control, median age = 68 years) and demonstrated
that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of
neurovascular pericytes. Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and
ubiquitous in, patients that exhibited moderate to high ACE2 expression in
perivascular cells. Viral dsRNA was identified in the vascular wall and
paralleled by perivascular inflammation, as signified by T cell and macrophage
infiltration. Furthermore, fibrinogen leakage indicated compromised integrity of 
the blood-brain barrier. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid from additional 16
individuals (n = 8 COVID-19, median age = 67 years; n = 8 control, median age =
69.5 years) exhibited significantly lower levels of the pericyte marker PDGFRβ in
SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, indicative of disrupted pericyte homeostasis. We
conclude that pericyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 underlies virus entry into the
privileged central nervous system space, as well as neurological symptomatology
due to perivascular inflammation and a locally compromised blood-brain barrier.
