Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has received global attention due to the serious
threat it poses to public health. Since the outbreak in December 2019, millions
of people have been affected and its rapid global spread has led to an upsurge in
the search for treatment. To discover hit compounds that can be used alone or in 
combination with repositioned drugs, we first analyzed the pharmacokinetic and
toxicological properties of natural products from Brazil's semiarid region.
After, we analyzed the site prediction and druggability of the SARS-CoV-2 main
protease (Mpro), followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The best 
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes revealed that other sites were accessed, confirming
that our approach could be employed as a suitable starting protocol for ligand
prioritization, reinforcing the importance of catalytic cysteine-histidine
residues and providing new structural data that could increase the antiviral
development mainly against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we selected 10 molecules that could 
be in vitro assayed in response to COVID-19. Two compounds (b01 and b02) suggest 
a better potential for interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and could be further
studied.
