In the last few years, next-generation sequencing techniques have started to be
used to identify new viruses infecting plants. This has allowed to rapidly
increase our knowledge on viruses other than those causing symptoms in
economically important crops. Here we used this approach to identify a virus
infecting Physcomitrium patens that has the typical structure of the
double-stranded RNA endogenous viruses of the Amalgaviridae family, which we
named Physcomitrium patens amalgavirus 1, or PHPAV1. PHPAV1 is present only in
certain accessions of P. patens, where its RNA can be detected throughout the
cell cycle of the plant. Our analysis demonstrates that PHPAV1 can be vertically 
transmitted through both paternal and maternal germlines, in crosses between
accessions that contain the virus with accessions that do not contain it. This
work suggests that PHPAV1 can replicate in genomic backgrounds different from
those that actually contain the virus and opens the door for future studies on
virus-host coevolution.
