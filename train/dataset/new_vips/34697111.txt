INTRODUCTION: Combination antiviral therapy of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) and
pegylated interferon alpha (peg-IFN alpha) decrease hepatitis B virus (HBV)
surface antigen (HBsAg) levels to achieve functional cure and improve long-term
prognosis in chronic hepatitis B patients. However, for hepatitis B-related liver
fibrosis, studies on combination of these two medicines are limited. This study
was designed to compare the efficacy between peg-IFN alpha combined with
tenofovir (TDF) and TDF monotherapy for the clearance of HBsAg in NA-experienced 
patients with HBV-related liver fibrosis.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study was designed to be a prospective, multicentre,
open, randomised controlled study. A total of 272 patients with HBV-related liver
fibrosis will be randomised into the combination therapy group or the monotherapy
group at a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the combination group will receive
subcutaneous injections of peg-IFN alpha 180 µg per week for 48 weeks combined
with oral TDF 300 mg daily. Participants in the monotherapy group will receive
300 mg oral TDF daily alone. All participants will undergo long-term treatment
with TDF and will be followed up at the outpatient department for 144 weeks after
randomisation. Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and examination indicators
will be collected at each follow-up time point, and adverse events will be
recorded. The primary endpoint is serological clearance rate of HBsAg at 48
weeks.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The ethics committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital
at Sun Yat-sen University approved this study (Approval Number: (2020)02-183-01).
The results of the study will be presented at relevant meetings and published in 
an appropriate journal after the completion of the trial and the analysis of the 
data.
