Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae
family. Primary infection causes chickenpox followed by latency in the sensory
ganglia, which can sometimes reactivate leading to herpes zoster. Chicken pox is 
generally a mild disease of childhood with a secondary attack rate of >85%, but
disseminated VZV infection with visceral involvement and fatal outcome may occur 
in immunocompromised individuals. Indian Academy of Pediatrics recommends two
doses of live-attenuated varicella vaccine in healthy unexposed children at 15-18
months and then at 4-6 years of age. The effectiveness of a single dose of
vaccine is around 85% and with a two-dose schedule is as high as 92%. Despite the
vaccine-induced protection, community-acquired VZV infections still remain a
problem in immunocompromised population. We hereby report a case of a previously 
immunized pediatric liver-transplant recipient who acquired VZV infection. This
case report clearly highlights the importance of strict environmental infection
control practices, early suspicion, diagnosis, and management in such cases.
