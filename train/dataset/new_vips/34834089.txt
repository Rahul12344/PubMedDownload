The treatment of viral disease has become a medical challenge because of the
increasing incidence and prevalence of human viral pathogens, as well as the lack
of viable treatment alternatives, including plant-derived strategies. This review
attempts to investigate the trends of research on in vitro antiviral effects of
curcumin against different classes of human viral pathogens worldwide. Various
electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google
Scholar were searched for published English articles evaluating the anti-viral
activity of curcumin. Data were then extracted and analyzed. The forty-three
studies (published from 1993 to 2020) that were identified contain data for 24
different viruses. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), 50%
effective/inhibitory concentration (EC50/IC50), and stimulation index (SI)
parameters showed that curcumin had antiviral activity against viruses causing
diseases in humans. Data presented in this review highlight the potential
antiviral applications of curcumin and open new avenues for further experiments
on the clinical applications of curcumin and its derivatives.
