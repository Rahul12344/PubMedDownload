Current guidelines for patient isolation in COVID-19 cases recommend a
symptom-based approach, averting the use of control real-time reverse
transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) testing. However, we hypothesized that patients with 
persistently positive results by RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be potentially infectious for a prolonged time, 
even if immunocompetent and asymptomatic, which would demand a longer social
isolation period than presently recommended. To test this hypothesis, 72 samples 
from 51 mildly symptomatic immunocompetent patients with long-lasting positive
rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 were tested for their infectiousness in cell
culture. The serological response of samples from those patients and virus
genomic integrity were also analyzed. Infectious viruses were successfully
isolated from 34.38% (22/64) of nasopharynx samples obtained 14 days or longer
after symptom onset. Indeed, we observed successful virus isolation up to
128 days. Complete SARS-COV-2 genome integrity was demonstrated, suggesting the
presence of replication-competent viruses. No correlation was found between the
isolation of infectious viruses and rRT-PCR cycle threshold values or the humoral
immune response. These findings call attention to the need to review current
isolation guidelines, particularly in scenarios involving high-risk individuals. 
IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated mildly symptomatic immunocompetent
patients with long-lasting positive rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Infectious
viruses were successfully isolated in cell cultures from nasopharynx samples
obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset. Indeed, we observed successful
virus isolation for up to 128 days. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genome integrity was
demonstrated by sequencing, suggesting the presence of replication-competent
viruses. These data point out the risk of continuous SARS-CoV-2 transmission from
patients with prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract,
which has important implications for current precaution guidelines, particularly 
in settings where vulnerable individuals may be exposed (e.g., nursing homes and 
hospitals).
