Intestinal epithelial damage is associated with most digestive diseases and
results in detrimental effects on nutrient absorption and production of hormones 
and antimicrobial defense molecules. Thus, understanding epithelial repair and
regeneration following damage is essential in developing therapeutics that assist
in rapid healing and restoration of normal intestinal function. Here we used a
well-characterized enteric virus (rotavirus) that damages the epithelium at the
villus tip but does not directly damage the intestinal stem cell, to explore the 
regenerative transcriptional response of the intestinal epithelium at the
single-cell level. We found that there are specific Lgr5 + cell subsets that
exhibit increased cycling frequency associated with significant expansion of the 
epithelial crypt. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of immature
enterocytes. Unexpectedly, we found rotavirus infects tuft cells. Transcriptional
profiling indicates tuft cells respond to viral infection through
interferon-related pathways. Together these data provide insights as to how the
intestinal epithelium responds to insults by providing evidence of stimulation of
a repair program driven by stem cells with involvement of tuft cells that results
in the production of immature enterocytes that repair the damaged epithelium.
