RNA interference (RNAi) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 can prevent and reverse
behavioral deficits and neuropathological readouts in mouse models, with safety
and benefit lasting over many months. The RNAi trigger, expressed from
adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV.miS1), also corrected misregulated microRNAs 
(miRNA) such as miR150. Subsequently, we showed that the delivery method was
scalable, and that AAV.miS1 was safe in short-term pilot nonhuman primate (NHP)
studies. To advance the technology to patients, investigational new drug
(IND)-enabling studies in NHPs were initiated. After AAV.miS1 delivery to deep
cerebellar nuclei, we unexpectedly observed cerebellar toxicity. Both
small-RNA-seq and studies using AAVs devoid of miRNAs showed that this was not a 
result of saturation of the endogenous miRNA processing machinery. RNA-seq
together with sequencing of the AAV product showed that, despite limited amounts 
of cross-packaged material, there was substantial inverted terminal repeat (ITR) 
promoter activity that correlated with neuropathologies. ITR promoter activity
was reduced by altering the miS1 expression context. The surprising contrast
between our rodent and NHP findings highlight the need for extended safety
studies in multiple species when assessing new therapeutics for human
application.
