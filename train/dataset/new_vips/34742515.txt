BACKGROUND: Transitioning from education to practice is stressful for new nurses 
and those entering new roles and can lead to workforce attrition and burnout.
This dynamic is likely complicated when graduates are transitioning to practice
during a pandemic.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe recent nurse graduates'
perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their transition from
education to practice.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey of BSN, RN-BSN, and DNP students who
graduated between December 2019 and April 2020 (n = 82), including demographics, 
employment information, and free-response questions about the impact of the
pandemic on their transition experiences, post-graduation plans, and perceptions 
of nursing. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to content analysis to
synthesize and summarize the data.
RESULTS: Participants expressed three overarching concerns: 1) altered plans such
as difficulty finding employment; 2) logistical, system-related stressors
including licensing delays and chaotic onboarding; and 3) feeling pride in
profession despite perceiving ambivalence in public discourse.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 exacerbated challenges often experienced by new graduates.
Common stressors, intensified during the pandemic, could exert long-term effects 
on the workforce. Educators and healthcare organizations must work to ensure
nursing graduates receive the necessary support for a successful transition.
