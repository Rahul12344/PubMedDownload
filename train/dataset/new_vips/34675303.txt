Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, some COVID-19 patients experience severe host
driven adverse events. To treat these complications, their underlying etiology
and drug treatments must be identified. Thus, a novel AI methodology MOATAI-VIR, 
which predicts disease-protein-pathway relationships and repurposed FDA-approved 
drugs to treat COVID-19's clinical manifestations was developed. SARS-CoV-2
interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure genes provide 
the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting 
disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their
clinical manifestations. To assess each manifestation's molecular basis, their
prioritized shared proteins were subject to global pathway analysis. Next, the
molecular features associated with hallmark COVID-19 phenotypes, e.g. unusual
neurological symptoms, cytokine storms, and blood clots were explored. In
practice, 24/26 of the major clinical manifestations are successfully predicted. 
Three major uncharacterized manifestation categories including neoplasms are also
found. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might be an oncovirus
due to shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication.
Then, repurposed FDA-approved drugs that might treat COVID-19's clinical
manifestations are predicted by virtual ligand screening of the most frequent
comorbid protein targets. These drugs might help treat both COVID-19's severe
adverse events and lesser ones such as loss of taste/smell.
