Background and Aims: Palliative care is a critical component of the response of a
healthcare system to a pandemic. We present risk factors associated with
mortality and highlight an operational palliative care consult service in
facilitating early identification of risk factors to guide goal-concordant care
and rational utilization of finite healthcare resources during a pandemic.
Methods: In this case series of 100 consecutive patients hospitalized with
COVID-19, we analyzed clinical data, treatment including palliative care, and
outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to three hospitals in
Seattle, Washington. We compared data between patients who were discharged and
non-survivors.
Results: Age (OR 4.67 [1.43, 15.32] ages 65-79; OR 3.96 [1.05, 14.89] ages
80-97), dementia (OR 5.62 [1.60, 19.74]), and transfer from a congregate living
facility (OR 5.40 [2.07, 14.07]), as well hypoxemia and tachypnea (OR 7.00 [2.91,
22.41]; OR 2.78 [1.11, 6.97]) were associated with mortality. Forty-one (41%)
patients required intensive care and 22 (22%) invasive mechanical ventilation.
Forty-six (46%) patients were seen by the palliative care service, resulting in a
change of resuscitation status in 54% of admitted patients. Fifty-eight (58%)
patients recovered and were discharged, 34 (34%) died, and eight (8%) remained
hospitalized, of which seven ultimately survived and one died.
Conclusions: Older age, dementia, and congregate living were associated with
mortality. Early discussions of goals of care facilitated by an operational
palliative care consult service can effectively guide goal-concordant care in
patients at high risk for mortality during a pandemic. Development of a
functional palliative care consult service is an important component of pandemic 
planning.
