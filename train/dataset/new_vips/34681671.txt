The infection of mammalian cells by enveloped viruses is triggered by the
interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with the glycosaminoglycan, heparan
sulfate. By mimicking this carbohydrate, some anionic polysaccharides can block
this interaction and inhibit viral entry and infection. As heparan sulfate
carries both carboxyl and sulfate groups, this work focused on the derivatization
of a (1→3)(1→6)-β-D-glucan, botryosphaeran, with these negatively-charged groups 
in an attempt to improve its antiviral activity. Carboxyl and sulfonate groups
were introduced by carboxymethylation and sulfonylation reactions, respectively. 
Three derivatives with the same degree of carboxymethylation (0.9) and different 
degrees of sulfonation (0.1; 0.2; 0.4) were obtained. All derivatives were
chemically characterized and evaluated for their antiviral activity against
herpes (HSV-1, strains KOS and AR) and dengue (DENV-2) viruses. Carboxymethylated
botryosphaeran did not inhibit the viruses, while all
sulfonated-carboxymethylated derivatives were able to inhibit HSV-1. DENV-2 was
inhibited only by one of these derivatives with an intermediate degree of
sulfonation (0.2), demonstrating that the dengue virus is more resistant to
anionic β-D-glucans than the Herpes simplex virus. By comparison with a previous 
study on the antiviral activity of sulfonated botryosphaerans, we conclude that
the presence of carboxymethyl groups might have a detrimental effect on antiviral
activity.
