Liver enzymes abnormalities are one of the reported presentations of coronavirus 
infection mostly in hospitalized patients. It is important that physicians take
all the possible causes of acute hepatitis in consideration when dealing with
abnormal liver enzymes in a patient with COVID-19 infection to reduce the risk of
overlooking the underlying disease. Hereby, we reported case of a 39-year-Old man
who presented with severe acute hepatitis and was infected with COVID-19,
hepatitis A and herpes simplex virus simultaneously.
