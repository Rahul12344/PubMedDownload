Understanding the trajectory, duration, and determinants of antibody responses
after SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform subsequent protection and risk of
reinfection, however large-scale representative studies are limited. Here we
estimated antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population 
using representative data from 7,256 United Kingdom COVID-19 infection survey
participants who had positive swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from 26-April-2020 to
14-June-2021. A latent class model classified 24% of participants as
'non-responders' not developing anti-spike antibodies, who were older, had higher
SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values during infection (i.e. lower viral burden), and
less frequently reported any symptoms. Among those who seroconverted, using
Bayesian linear mixed models, the estimated anti-spike IgG peak level was
7.3-fold higher than the level previously associated with 50% protection against 
reinfection, with higher peak levels in older participants and those of non-white
ethnicity. The estimated anti-spike IgG half-life was 184 days, being longer in
females and those of white ethnicity. We estimated antibody levels associated
with protection against reinfection likely last 1.5-2 years on average, with
levels associated with protection from severe infection present for several
years. These estimates could inform planning for vaccination booster strategies.
