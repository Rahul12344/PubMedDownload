The aim of this study was to elucidate the meaning of critical illness for people
with COVID-19. This study used a qualitative design. Thirteen people who were
critically ill with COVID-19 during 2020 and admitted to a COVID-19 intensive
care unit in northern Sweden participated in the study. Data collection was
conducted as individual interviews with a narrative approach, and data were
analyzed with phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation. The participants did
not think they would get critically ill with this unexpected illness. They
experienced terrible nightmares where their relatives had been killed, and they
missed their relatives both in their dreams and in reality, as they had not been 
allowed to be with them due to the virus. Gratefulness was described for
surviving. Participants described thoughts of not being able to imagine going
through this again. They felt fear and loneliness, as a terrifying unreality had 
become a reality.
