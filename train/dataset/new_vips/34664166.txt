In the light of thousands of infections and deaths, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a worldwide
pandemic. It has spread to about 22 million people worldwide, with a total of
0.45 million expiries, limiting the movement of most people worldwide in the last
6 months. However, COVID-19 became the foremost health, economic, and
humanitarian challenge of the twenty-first century. Measures intended to curb the
pandemic of COVID-19 included travel bans, lockdowns, and social distances
through shelter orders, which will further stop human activities suddenly and
eventually impact the world and the national economy. The viral disease is caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After SARS-CoV-2
virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related CoV, COVID-19 is the
third most significant lethal disease to humans. According to WHO, COVID-19
mortality exceeded that of SARS and MERS since COVID-19 was declared an
international public health emergency. Genetic sequencing has recently
established that COVID-19 is close to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus which has not 
yet been recognized as the key cause of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission,
and human pathogen mechanism. This review focuses on a brief introduction of
novel coronavirus pathogens, including coronavirus in humans and animals, its
taxonomic classification, symptoms, pathogenicity, social impact, economic
impact, and potential treatment therapy for COVID-19.
