Sclerotinia sclerotiorum reovirus 1 (SsReV1) was previously reported to infect
hypovirulent strain SCH941 of the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
and to contain 11 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (S1-S11). Here, we report 
that SsReV1 is actually composed of 12 dsRNA segments instead of 11. The
full-length nucleotide sequence of the twelfth segment (S12) was determined using
a combination of RACE and high-throughput sequencing methods. S12 is 1217
nucleotides in length and has highly conserved terminal sequences that resemble
those of the other 11 segments of SsReV1. S12 contains a single open reading
frame encoding a protein (VP12) of 311 amino acids. Although regular BLAST
analysis did not reveal any similarity of VP12 to known sequences, it was found
to be homologous to the VP11 of Colorado tick fever virus of the genus Coltivirus
when a hidden-Markov-model-based HHpred analysis was performed. A
single-protoplast regeneration experiment suggested that S12 and S2 were
maintained or lost in parallel. In summary, the SsReV1 genome consists of 12
dsRNA segments.
