Introduction: In previous pandemics such as the Ebola virus outbreak in West
Africa, it has been observed that patients with non-pandemic related complaints, 
delay their presentation to hospital. Similarly, delayed presentation of patients
with chest pain during the COVID-19 pandemic has been documented. This
qualitative study identified the COVID-19 related reasons which lead to this
delay.
Methods: A qualitative study based on 10 individual patient interviews. Half of
these were conducted at a public hospital emergency centre (EC) and the other
half at a private EC.
Results: A variety of psychosocial factors were identified as themes for delayed 
presentation. Interestingly, the fear of contracting COVID-19 at the hospital was
not found to be an important theme in our study. Rather, confusion around
hospital protocols during the pandemic was identified as a recurrent theme.
Discussion: This study found that confusion about COVID-19 hospital protocols was
the major pandemic related delaying factor. A number of themes unrelated to
COVID-19 were also identified.
African relevance: •As of 31 August 2021, South Africa has more than 2,7 million 
cases of COVID-19 with more than 81,000 deaths.•Cardiovascular disease causes 13%
of deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.•Delayed presentation of patients with
non-pandemic related symptoms, is often reported as a concern in countries of the
developing world.
