BACKGROUND: To evaluate the protective efficacy of a hepatitis B (HB) vaccination
program in Taiwan among high-risk children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children born to HBeAg-positive mothers from 2001 to 2010
were invited back. Blood samples for hepatitis B virus (HBV) seromarkers were
taken and the children underwent hepatobiliary ultrasonography. Perinatal factors
including delivery mode and vaccination history were collected from their medical
records. According to the results of HBV serological markers, the children were
initially classified into five groups: HBV naïve, HB vaccine responder, HBsAg
carrier, recovered from HBV infection, and anti-HBc-positive alone. Children in
the HBV naïve and anti-HBc-positive alone groups who presented with an anamnestic
response after a booster HB vaccine were re-assigned to the vaccine responder and
recovered from infection groups, respectively.
RESULTS: All of the 196 enrolled children received postnatal hepatitis B
immunoglobulin (HBIG) and HB vaccinations, of whom one was HBV naïve (0.5%), 109 
were vaccine responders (55.6%), 21 were carriers (10.7%), and 65 recovered from 
infection (33.2%). Among the 21 carriers, 14 (66.7%) presented in the
immunotolerant phase. Cesarean section was the only significant perinatal factor 
between the carriers (5.3%) and those who recovered from infection (37.7%)
(p=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was a 43.9% HBV infection rate and 10.7% HBsAg 
carrier rate in high-risk Taiwanese children even after receiving HBIG and HB
vaccinations. Cesarean section may protect newborns from becoming HBsAg carriers,
while HBV genotype and time of HBIG injection did not contribute to the HBV
carrier rate.
