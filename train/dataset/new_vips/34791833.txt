The ability of COVID-19 vaccination to induce anti-HLA antibodies (Abs) formation
in renal transplant candidates is not well studied. A 42-year-old man on a renal 
transplant waitlist, with no sensitization history, was tested for DSA before and
after COVID-19 vaccination. Patient has consistently tested negative for COVID-19
virus. Eighteen days after receiving first dose of mRNA-based vaccine, flow
cytometry crossmatch (FCXM) was strongly positive with de novo donor-specific Ab 
(dnDSA) against B57 and de novo non-DSA against B58. Before vaccination,
preliminary FCXM was negative with no anti-HLA Abs. This event prompted the
transplant team to cancel the surgery. COVID-19 vaccination could be associated
with anti-HLA Abs formation in renal patients on waitlists that could affect
future transplantability.
