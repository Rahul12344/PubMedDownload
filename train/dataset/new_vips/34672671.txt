Can ferritin/lymphocyte percentage ratio, a new indicator, predict the clinical
course of COVID-19 cases?

Aygun H, Eraybar S.

OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 maintains its seriousness as a global emergency with its
rapid distribution worldwide. Ferritin/lymphocyte percentage ratio (FLPR) may
appear as a prognostic value at the initial evaluation stage and thus can be used
as a simple, effective and reliable parameter in identification of patients
critically ill with COVID-19.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we evaluated patients who were
hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 based on positive PCR results.
We calculated FLPRs and classified disease severity due to initial emergency
evaluation. The relationship between the severity of the need for hospitalization
and intensive care, and 28-day mortality with FLPR were evaluated.
RESULTS: The differences between the groups as for COVID-19 severity and FLPR
means were statistically significant (x2=148.284; SD=3; p=0.000). FLPR levels
were found to be high in groups with critically and seriously ill patients. In
the ROC analysis for the FLPR level, the area under the curve (AUC) value was
found to be 0.909 (95 % CI 0.857-0.961). When the cutâ€‘off value of FLPR was
21.11, the sensitivity and specificity were 82.9 % and 82.8 %, respectively.
CONCLUSION: FLPR, a new parameter, can be used as a significant marker to predict
the 28-day mortality patients (Tab. 6, Fig. 1, Ref. 25). Text in PDF www.elis.sk
