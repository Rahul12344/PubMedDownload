Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects 0.5% to 1.0% of the Canadian
population. Most paediatric HCV infections are a consequence of vertical
transmission or, among youth and young adults, the result of engaging in
high-risk behaviours, such as injection drug use and unprotected sexual activity.
It is now recommended that all infants, children, and youth with one or more risk
factors be screened for HCV infection. Treating chronic HCV infection with
direct-acting antivirals has been shown to achieve sustained virologic
suppression in 97% to 100% of children as young as 3 years old. Paediatricians
and family physicians have an important role in educating youth regarding HCV
infection risks and prevention, and in advocating to government and public health
authorities for comprehensive harm reduction interventions targeting at-risk
youth, accessible treatments, and routine prenatal screening for HCV.
