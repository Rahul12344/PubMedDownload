Early and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses at the point-of-care is crucial for reducing
disease transmission during the current pandemic and future flu seasons. To
prepare for potential cocirculation of these two viruses, we report a
valve-enabled, paper-based sample preparation device integrated with isothermal
amplification for their simultaneous detection. The device incorporates (1) virus
lysis and RNA enrichment, enabled by ball-based valves for sequential delivery of
reagents with no pipet requirement, (2) reverse transcription loop-mediated
isothermal amplification, carried out in a coffee mug, and (3) colorimetric
detection. We have used the device for simultaneously detecting inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A H1N1 viruses in 50 min, with limits of detection at 2 
and 6 genome equivalents, respectively. The device was further demonstrated to
detect both viruses in environmental samples.
