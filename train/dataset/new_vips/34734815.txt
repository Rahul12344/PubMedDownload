OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of fragmented
QRS (f-QRS) with in-hospital death in patients with severe novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: This was a retrospective and observational study. A total of 201
consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled. Demographic data,
laboratory parameters, medications, electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, and
clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients with and without f-QRS were compared,
and predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 135 patients without f-QRS (mean age of 64 years, 43% women) 
and 66 patients with f-QRS (mean age of 66 years, 39% women) were included.
C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, troponin I, ferritin levels, and CRP to
albumin ratio were significantly higher in patients with f-QRS. The need for
invasive mechanical ventilation (63.6% vs. 41.5%, p=0.003) and all-cause
in-hospital mortality [54.5% vs. 28.9%, log rank p=0.001, relative risk 1.88, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.16-4.78] were significantly higher in patients with
f-QRS. A number value of f-QRS leads ≥2 yields sensitivity and specificity (85.3%
and 86.7%, respectively) for predicting in-hospital all-cause mortality.
Multivariable analysis showed that f-QRS (odds ratio: 1.041, 95% Cl: 1.021-1.192,
p=0.040) were independently associated with in-hospital death.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the presence of f-QRS in ECG is associated
with higher in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.
f-QRS is an easily applicable simple indicator to predict the risk of death in
these patients.
