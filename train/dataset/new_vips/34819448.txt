These risk factors of advancing age, male gender and co-existing health
conditions like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity do not
fully explain why some people have no or mild symptoms whereas others have severe
symptoms. Genomewide association study (GWAS) identify a 3p21.31 gene cluster as 
a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with COVID-19 with respiratory
failure. They also found a higher risk among persons with blood group A and
protective effect for blood group O than among patients with other blood groups. 
The particular haplotype in a region of chromosome 3 is contributed to modern
humans by neandertals. Another Neanderthal haplotype on chromosome 12 is
associated with a 22% reduction in relative risk of becoming severely ill with
COVID-19. The ApoE e4e4 homozygous genotype was found to increase the risk of
severe COVID-19. Change in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 gene was also
found to be associated with increased risk of COVID-19, cardiovascular and
pulmonary conditions.
