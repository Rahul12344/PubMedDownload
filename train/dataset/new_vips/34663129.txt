BACKGROUND: Globally, countries are rolling out Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quarantine policies and vaccination programs. Research
studies are needed in helping understand the likelihood of acquired immunity to
reinfection and identify priority groups for vaccination to inform them. This
study aimed to assess period prevalence and longitudinal changes in antibody
levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qatari primary care settings.
METHODS: A cohort study design with 2 data collection phases was undertaken-Phase
1 (conducted in July 2020) and Phase 2 (conducted in October 2020). A stratified 
random sampling technique by age, gender and nationality was utilized to identify
the study sample. The total sample size required for the study was estimated to
be 2102. Participants were invited to an appointment where they were administered
a questionnaire and provided samples for polymerase chain reaction and
Immunoglobulin G immunoassay tests.
RESULTS: A total of 943 individuals participated in both Phase 1 and Phase 2. In 
this cohort, seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 12% (N = 113) in Phase 
1 and 17.2% (N = 162) in Phase 2. Of the 113 participants who were seropositive
in Phase 1, 38.1% (CI 29.5-47.2%, N = 43) had a reduction, 54.9% (CI 45.7-63.8%, 
N = 62) had no change, and 7.1% (CI 3.4-12.9%, N = 8) had an increase in IgG
titer in Phase 2. All (N = 18) participants aged 10 to 17 years retained their
antibodies. The proportion of men who retained their antibodies was slightly
higher compared to women-92.5% (N = 74) and 87.9% (N = 29) respectively.
Similarly, symptomatic individuals (97.8%; N = 45) had a higher antibody
retention compared with asymptomatic individuals (86.4%; N = 57).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary information on the longitudinal
changes in antibody levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings will help
inform quarantine policies and vaccination programs.
