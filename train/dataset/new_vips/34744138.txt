The intra- and inter-observer variability in diagnosis of thoracic CT images may 
affect the diagnosis of COVID-19. Therefore, several studies have been reported
to develop artificial intelligence (AI) approaches using deep learning (DL) and
radiomics technologies. The difference between them is automatic feature
extraction (DL) and hand-crafted one (radiomics). The advantages of the AI-based 
imaging approaches for the COVID-19 are fast throughput, non-invasion,
quantification, and integration of PCR results, CT findings, and clinical
information. To the best of my knowledge, three types of the AI approaches have
been studied: detection, severity differentiation, and prognosis prediction of
COVID-19. AI technologies on assessment of severity/prediction of prognosis for
COVID-19 may be more crucial than detection of COVID-19 pneumonia after COVID-19 
becomes one of common diseases.
