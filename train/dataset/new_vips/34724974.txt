BACKGROUND: This report describes the case of a patient whose pituitary
microadenoma resolved after he contracted coronavirus disease 2019. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first reported cases of pituitary tumor resolution 
due to viral illness. We present this case to further investigate the
relationship between inflammatory response and tumor remission.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man in Yemen presented to the hospital with
fever, low blood oxygen saturation, and shortness of breath. The patient was
diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. Past medical history included pituitary 
microadenoma that was diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging and secondary
adrenal insufficiency, which was treated with steroids. Due to the severity of
coronavirus disease 2019, he was treated with steroids and supportive care.
Three months after his initial presentation to the hospital, brain magnetic
resonance imaging was performed and compared with past scans. Magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed changes in the microadenoma, including the disappearance of the 
hypointense lesion and hyperintense enhancement observed on the previous scan.
CONCLUSIONS: Pituitary adenomas rarely undergo spontaneous resolution. Therefore,
we hypothesized that tumor resolution was secondary to an immune response to
coronavirus disease 2019.
