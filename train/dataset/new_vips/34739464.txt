BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries
adopted restrictive measures to mitigate infection spread, which might have
influenced people's lifestyle and dietary habits. We conducted a systematic
review to evaluate the impact of national lockdowns on adherence to the
Mediterranean Diet (MD).
METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and
the Cochrane Library. Studies published until 4th May 2021 were included. We only
considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and
assessing changes in adherence to the MD, using validated dietary scores, or in
consumption of MD food items. Data extraction, pooling, and quality appraisal of 
included studies were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: Forty-two studies were retrieved. After screening, 12 studies met
inclusion criteria and were included in the review, of which 4 (33%) were
longitudinal studies. Six (85.7%) of the seven studies that measured changes in
MD adherence before-during lockdown reported an increase (rate of change of
high-adherence to MD ranged between +3.3% and +21.9%). Evidence indicates that
consumption of MD food items increased during lockdown but is heterogeneous in
study design, quality, and findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest adherence to the MD during lockdown might have
increased in some settings, while the determinants of such a trend are to be
further explored. We raise awareness of the need to research further the impacts 
and long-term consequences of COVID-19 containment measures on dietary and
lifestyle habits.
