INTRODUCTION: Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models for HIV treatment
decrease health facility visit frequency and limit healthcare facility-based
exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, two
important evidence gaps include understanding DSD effectiveness amongst clients
commencing DSD within 12 months of antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation and 
amongst clients receiving only single annual clinical consultations. To
investigate these, we pooled data from two cluster-randomized trials
investigating community-based DSD in Zimbabwe and Lesotho.
METHODS: Individual-level participant data of newly stable adults enrolled
between 6 and 12 months after ART initiation were pooled. Both trials (conducted 
between August 2017 and July 2019) had three arms: Standard-of-care three-monthly
ART provision at healthcare facilities (SoC, control); ART provided three-monthly
in community ART groups (CAGs) (3MC) and ART provided six-monthly in either CAGs 
or at community-distribution points (6MC). Clinical visits were three-monthly in 
SoC and annually in intervention arms. The primary outcome was retention in care 
and secondary outcomes were viral suppression (VS) and number of unscheduled
facility visits 12 months after enrolment. Individual-level regression analyses
were conducted by intention-to-treat specifying for clustering and adjusted for
country.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 599 participants were included; 212 (35.4%),
128 (21.4%) and 259 (43.2%) in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Few participants
aged <25 years were included (n = 32). After 12 months, 198 (93.4%), 123 (96.1%) 
and 248 (95.8%) were retained in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Retention in 3MC
was superior versus SoC, adjusted risk difference (aRD) = 4.6% (95% CI:
0.7%-8.5%). Retention in 6MC was non-inferior versus SoC, aRD = 1.7% (95% CI:
-2.5%-5.9%) (prespecified non-inferiority aRD margin -3.25%). VS was similar
between arms, 99.3, 98.6 and 98.1% in SoC, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. Adjusted
risk ratio's for VS were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.03) for 3MC versus SoC, and 0.98
(CI: 0.95-1.00) for 6MC versus SoC. Unscheduled clinic visits were not increased 
in intervention arms: incidence rate ratio = 0.53 (CI: 0.16-1.80) for 3MC versus 
SoC; and 0.82 (CI: 0.25-2.79) for 6MC versus SoC.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-based DSD incorporating three- and six-monthly ART refills
and single annual clinical visits were at least non-inferior to standard
facility-based care amongst newly stable ART clients aged ≥25 years.
