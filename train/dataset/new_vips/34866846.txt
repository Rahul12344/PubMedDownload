Background/Aims: This study aimed to study the outcome and survival of patients
with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving drug-eluting beads (DEBs)
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In addition, tumor morphologies were
correlated with the response and survival to analyze the association of
morphology with the outcome.
Methods: Patients with large HCC (>5 cm) who underwent DEB-TACE for palliation
were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were assessed for objective response (OR)
and overall survival (OS), which was calculated from the first session of
DEB-TACE to the last follow-up/death. OR and OS were calculated for the entire
study group and were compared among the subgroups consisting of solitary versus
multifocal HCC, unilobar versus bilobar disease, well-defined versus ill-defined 
HCC, and HCC with homogeneous enhancement versus HCC with heterogeneous
enhancement.
Results: Sixty-seven DEB-TACE procedures were performed in 25 patients (average: 
2.7 ± 1.4 sessions per patient). The mean lesion size was 9.9 ± 4.5 cm. Of 25
patients, 13 (52%) had multifocal HCC. Unilobar disease was seen in 15 patients
(60%). The mean duration of follow-up was 24.4 months. OR at 6 and 12 months were
56% and 48%, respectively, with well-defined lesions showing better OR. The
median OS was 28 months (95% confidence interval, 12.3-43.6). OS rate at 12 and
24 months was 92% and 57%, respectively. OS was seen to be superior in
well-defined HCC and unilobar disease.
Conclusion: In this study, DEB-TACE has shown to have a good response in patients
having large/multifocal HCC with preserved liver functions. Well-defined HCC and 
unilobar disease have a better response and survival.
