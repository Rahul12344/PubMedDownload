Sparse data exist on the complex natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the population
level. We applied a well-validated multiplex serology test in 5000 participants
of a general population study in Catalonia in blood samples collected from end
June to mid November 2020. Based on responses to fifteen isotype-antigen
combinations, we detected a seroprevalence of 18.1% in adults (n = 4740), and
modeled extrapolation to the general population of Catalonia indicated a 15.3%
seroprevalence. Antibodies persisted up to 9 months after infection. Immune
profiling of infected individuals revealed that with increasing severity of
infection (asymptomatic, 1-3 symptoms, ≥ 4 symptoms, admitted to hospital/ICU),
seroresponses were more robust and rich with a shift towards IgG over IgA and
anti-spike over anti-nucleocapsid responses. Among seropositive participants,
lower antibody levels were observed for those ≥ 60 years vs < 60 years old and
smokers vs non-smokers. Overweight/obese participants vs normal weight had higher
antibody levels. Adolescents (13-15 years old) (n = 260) showed a seroprevalence 
of 11.5%, were less likely to be tested seropositive compared to their parents
and had dominant anti-spike rather than anti-nucleocapsid IgG responses. Our
study provides an unbiased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Catalonia and
new evidence on the durability and heterogeneity of post-infection immunity.
