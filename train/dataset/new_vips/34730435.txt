Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects eye corneal tissues leading to herpetic
stromal keratitis (HSK), which is one of the leading causes of blindness. Here in
our study, we found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a once clinically approved
medication for child acute myelogenous leukemia, inhibited multiple strains of
HSV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo. 6-TG is more potent than acyclovir (ACV)
and ganciclovir (GCV), with the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6-TG at
0.104 μM with high stimulation index (SI) (SI = 6,475.48) compared to the IC50 of
ACV at 1.253 μM and the IC50 of GCV at 1.257 μM. In addition, 6-TG at 500 μM
topically applied to the eyes with HSV-1 infection significantly inhibits HSV-1
replication, alleviates virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improves eye
conditions. More importantly, 6-TG is effective against ACV-resistant HSV-1
strains, including HSV-1/153 and HSV-1/blue. Knockdown of Rac1 with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) negatively affected HSV-1 replication, suggesting that
Rac1 facilitated HSV-1 replication. Following HSV-1 infection of human corneal
epithelial cells (HCECs), endogenous Rac1 activity was upregulated by glutathione
S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. We further found that Rac1 was highly
expressed in the corneal tissue of HSK patients compared to normal individuals.
Mechanistic study showed that 6-TG inhibited HSV-1 replication by targeting Rac1 
activity in HSV-1 infected cells, and the Rac1 is critical in the pathogenesis of
HSK. Our results indicated that 6-TG is a promising therapeutic molecule for the 
treatment of HSK. IMPORTANCE We reported the discovery of 6-TG inhibition of
HSV-1 infection and its inhibitory roles in HSK both in vitro and in vivo. 6-TG
was shown to possess at least 10× more potent inhibitory activity against HSV-1
than ACV and GCV and, more importantly, inhibit ACV/GCV-resistant mutant viruses.
Animal model studies showed that gel-formulated 6-TG topically applied to eyes
locally infected with HSV-1 could significantly inhibit HSV-1 replication,
alleviate virus-induced HSK pathogenesis, and improve eye conditions. Further
study showed that HSV-1 infection upregulated Rac1 expression, and knockdown of
Rac1 using siRNA markedly restricted HSV-1 replication, suggesting that Rac1 is
required for HSV-1 replication. In addition, we also documented that Rac1 is
highly expressed in corneal tissues from HSK patients, indicating that Rac1 is
associated with HSK pathogenesis. In view of the high potency of 6-TG, low
cytotoxicity, targeting a distinct therapeutic target, we suggest that 6-TG is a 
potential candidate for development as a therapeutic agent for HSK therapy.
