In response to COVID-19 pandemic, the Zimbabwe government put in place various
rigorous measures to curb the spread of the virus. Although roll-out and access
to COVID-19 vaccines in Africa have been slow, the World Health Organization
(WHO)-led COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) consortium and the African
vaccine acquisition task team are striving to provide 720 million doses of
COVID-19 vaccines to achieve 60% coverage in Africa by June, 2022. In line with
this, the Zimbabwe vaccination programme commenced on the 26th February 2021 and 
as of 9th June 2021, approximately, 2.6% of the population have been fully
vaccinated in the country. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has crippled the
economy and caused significant strain on the public health system, much has been 
done in the country since the first case was recorded (20th March 2020). However,
much more needs to be done to finally reach the expected 60% herd immunity by
June 2022.
