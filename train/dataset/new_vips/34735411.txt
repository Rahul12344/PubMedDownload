ABSTRACT: A 50-year-old woman with stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma presented for 
restaging FDG PET/CT status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy/immunotherapy and
diverting sigmoid colostomy. FDG PET/CT demonstrated FDG uptake in the known
sigmoid mass and in abdominopelvic lymph node metastases. Bilateral, asymmetric, 
hypermetabolic axillary lymphadenopathy was also observed, an atypical pattern of
spread for colon cancer. Further investigation revealed the patient had received 
both doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the 2 months prior to presentation. The authors
discuss immunogenic nodal hypermetabolism following vaccination against COVID-19 
and incorporating vaccination history to aid in PET/CT interpretation, especially
in malignancies involving the axillae.
