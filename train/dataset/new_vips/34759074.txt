We continue (Ref. 1: Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B 97, 22-49) to analyze the COVID-19
status. We concentrate on the following issues in this work:1. Effect of
vaccination against the spreading of SARS-CoV-2.2. General landscape of the world
situation concerning vaccinations.3. Some aspects of the new variants of
SARS-CoV-2.Our findings include:1. With vaccinations, it is fair to say that we
have entered a new phase in the fight against the virus SARS-CoV-2. We have
analyzed some preliminary data to find how vaccinations can be effective against 
COVID-19 spreading. This analysis is based on, and is a continuation of, our
first paper quoted in Ref. 1.2. If Tokyo (or Japan) continues to keep its
vaccination schedule (starting in early April, 2021 and finishing it for elderly,
65 or older, in 4 months), it will see a sign of control of the virus in early
June, 2021 although we see changes of this status due to new, more contagious
variants.3. The strength (parameter Î²) of a new contagious variant can be
estimated based on the initial data on the variant (Section 5).
