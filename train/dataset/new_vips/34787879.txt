OBJECTIVE: Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses contain spike-like projections of glycoprotein on their surface,
which appear like a crown. Millions of infections and thousands of deaths have
been reported worldwide to date. Hence, the objective of the present study was to
look for in silico evaluation of certain commercially available flavonoids
against SARS-CoV-2 enzyme.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in silico docking calculations were carried out using 
AutoDock 4.2 software. For the computational investigation, Apigenin, Catechin,
Galangin, Luteolin, Naringenin were selected. An anti-viral drug Remdesivir was
selected as reference drug.
RESULTS: In the present study we found that Naringenin showed excellent binding
score with the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme compared to the reference drug and other
selected flavonoids.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the docking results, we conclude that Naringenin can be
considered worthwhile to check its antiviral activity for the management of
Coronavirus disease.
