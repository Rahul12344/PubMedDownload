Niclosamide shows strong antiviral activity in a human airway model of SARS-CoV-2
infection and a conserved potency against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and
Delta variant (B.1.617.2).

SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging with potential increased transmissibility
highlighting the great unmet medical need for new therapies. Niclosamide is a
potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent that has advanced in clinical development. We
validate the potent antiviral efficacy of niclosamide in a SARS-CoV-2 human
airway model. Furthermore, niclosamide remains its potency against the D614G,
Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. Our data further
support the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of niclosamide and highlights its
great potential as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19.
