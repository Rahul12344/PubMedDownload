Solid core nanoparticles (NPs) coated with sulfonated ligands that mimic heparan 
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) can exhibit virucidal activity against many viruses
that utilize HSPG interactions with host cells for the initial stages of
infection. How the interactions of these NPs with large capsid segments of
HSPG-interacting viruses lead to their virucidal activity has been unclear. Here,
we describe the interactions between sulfonated NPs and segments of the human
papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) capsids using atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the NPs primarily bind at the
interfaces of two HPV16 capsid proteins. After equilibration, the distances and
angles between capsid proteins in the capsid segments are larger for the systems 
in which the NPs bind at the interfaces of capsid proteins. Over time, NP binding
can lead to breaking of contacts between two neighboring proteins. The revealed
mechanism of NPs targeting the interfaces between pairs of capsid proteins can be
utilized for designing new generations of virucidal materials and contribute to
the development of new broad-spectrum non-toxic virucidal materials.
