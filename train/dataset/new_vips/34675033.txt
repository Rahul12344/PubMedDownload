BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continues to pose a significant healthcare challenge
throughout the world. Comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension are
associated with a significantly higher mortality risk. However, the effect of
cirrhosis on COVID-19 outcomes has yet to be systematically assessed.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the reported clinical outcomes of patients with cirrhosis
who develop COVID-19 infection.
DESIGN/METHOD: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies included up 
to 3 February 2021. All English language primary research articles that reported 
clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19 were included. The
study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The risk of bias was
assessed using the Quality In Prognostic Score (QUIPS) risk-of-bias assessment
instrument for prognostic factor studies template. Meta-analysis was performed
using Cochrane RevMan V.5.4 software using a random effects model.
RESULTS: 63 studies were identified reporting clinical outcomes in patients with 
cirrhosis and concomitant COVID-19. Meta-analysis of cohort studies which report 
a non-cirrhotic comparator yielded a pooled mortality OR of 2.48 (95% CI: 2.02 to
3.04). Analysis of a subgroup of studies reporting OR for mortality in
hospitalised patients adjusted for significant confounders found a pooled
adjusted OR 1.81 (CI: 1.36 to 2.42).
CONCLUSION: Cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality
in COVID-19 infection compared to non-cirrhotic patients. Patients with cirrhosis
should be considered for targeted public health interventions to prevent COVID-19
infection, such as shielding and prioritisation of vaccination.
