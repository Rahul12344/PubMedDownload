Vaccines are effective measures that can mitigate the high burden of diseases.
However, vaccine refusal poses serious challenges for achieving coverage for
population immunity. With the availability of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)
vaccines, limited information is available about the university students'
acceptability and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. This article reports study 
findings regarding factors that influence university students' decision of
acceptability to the COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan. Results highlight the continued 
need for clear and consistent information about the vaccine by health care
decision-makers and university administrations.
