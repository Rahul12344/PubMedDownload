There is a need for wastewater based epidemiological (WBE) methods that integrate
multiple, variously sized surveillance sites across geographic areas. We
developed a novel indexing method, Melvin's Index, that provides a normalized and
standardized metric of wastewater pathogen load for qPCR assays that is resilient
to surveillance site variation. To demonstrate the utility of Melvin's Index, we 
used qRT-PCR to measure SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA levels in influent wastewater from
19 municipal wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF's) of varying sizes and served
populations across the state of Minnesota during the Summer of 2020. SARS-CoV-2
RNA was detected at each WWTF during the 20-week sampling period at a mean
concentration of 8.5 × 104 genome copies/L (range 3.2 × 102-1.2 × 109 genome
copies/L). Lag analysis of trends in Melvin's Index values and clinical COVID-19 
cases showed that increases in indexed wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels precede new
clinical cases by 15-17 days at the statewide level and by up to 25 days at the
regional/county level. Melvin's Index is a reliable WBE method and can be applied
to both WWTFs that serve a wide range of population sizes and to large regions
that are served by multiple WWTFs.
