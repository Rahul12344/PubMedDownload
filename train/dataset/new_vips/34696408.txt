The 2021 re-emergence of yellow fever in non-human primates in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul (RS), southernmost Brazil, resulted in the death of many howler
monkeys (genus Alouatta) and led the state to declare a Public Health Emergency
of State Importance, despite no human cases reported. In this study,
near-complete genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV) recovered from the outbreak
were sequenced and examined aiming at a better understanding of the phylogenetic 
relationships and the spatio-temporal dynamics of the virus distribution. Our
results suggest that the most likely sequence of events involved the
reintroduction of YFV from the state of São Paulo to RS through the states of
Paraná and Santa Catarina, by the end of 2020. These findings reinforce the role 
of genomic surveillance in determining the pathways of distribution of the virus 
and in providing references for the implementation of preventive measures for
populations in high risk areas.
