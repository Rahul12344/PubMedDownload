Aim: To investigate the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib (LEN) in liver disease
etiology, especially nonviral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods and Results: Sixty-seven patients with unresectable advanced HCC (u-HCC) 
treated with LEN and consisting of 26 hepatitis C virus (HCV), 19 hepatitis B
virus (HBV), 11 alcohol, and 11 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cases were
retrospectively recruited. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard
models were used to determine predictive factors for survival. The objective
response rate in the nonviral (alcohol and NASH) group was higher than that in
the viral group (59.1% [13/22] vs. 46.7% [21/45]). Progression-free survival was 
significantly longer in the nonviral group than in the viral group (13.7 vs.
6.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.324; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.174-0.602;
P < 0.01). Similarly, median overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in
the nonviral group than in the viral group (not evaluable vs. 15.9 months;
HR = 0.277; 95% CI = 0.116-0.662; P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that 
portal vein invasion (HR = 5.327, P = 0.0025), treatment line (HR = 0.455,
P = 0.023), and etiology (HR = 0.180, P = 0.00055) were significant independent
factors associated with OS in u-HCC patients treated with LEN.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that LEN is more effective against nonviral u-HCC
than against viral u-HCC.
