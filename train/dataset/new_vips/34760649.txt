Background: Hepatitis B virus infection is a major public health problem in
India, and all health-care workers (HCWs) need to be immunized to prevent
occupational exposure. This study was done to find the hepatitis B vaccination
rates, immune response, and predictors of titer <10 mIU/ml among students and
HCWs of a tertiary care institution in the state of Kerala.
Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the
Department of Microbiology, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, Kerala,
India, for a period of 1½ years between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017.
Vaccination rates were collected through a screening proforma. Of the 1321
participants who filled the screening proforma, 5 ml of blood was collected
aseptically from 579 participants who were fully vaccinated (all the three doses 
of vaccine) and stored at -20°C until antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
(anti-HBs) assay was done using Microlisa (Biorad). Data were analyzed using SPSS
for Windows, version 16.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (trial version).
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive data were expressed using frequencies and
percentages, and Chi-square test was applied to find the association between
antibody titer <10 mIU/ml and independent variables.
Results: Of the 1321 participants who filled up the screening proforma, the
vaccination rate was 72.6%. Majority of the participants, i.e. 83.5% of doctors, 
81.1% of nurses, 69.7% of students, and 21.4% of technicians, had taken all the
three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Of the fully vaccinated (n = 959)
participants, 76.9% had the vaccination during adulthood and only 26.1% had it
during childhood. The correlate of protection was defined as the presence of
anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/ml. The mean antibody titer was 448 ± 284.97 mIU/ml ranging from
9.8 to 2000. Of the 579 participants whose titer was checked, 71 (12.3%) had a
nonprotective titer of <10 mIU/ml. We found that age >35 (odds ratio [OR]: 3.85, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-6.99]), last dose >10 years (OR: 5.01, 95% CI:
2.94-8.55), no boosters or revaccination (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.42-6.07), and body 
mass index (BMI) >25 (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.44-3.39) were associated with
nonprotective titer.
Conclusion: More than a quarter of the study population who were at high risk of 
exposure were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Even after taking the full
course of hepatitis B vaccine, 12.3% had titer <10 mIU/ml. Nonprotective titer
was found to be associated with age >35 years, last dose taken >10 years ago, no 
boosters/revaccination, and BMI ≥25.
