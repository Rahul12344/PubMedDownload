Fungi represent one of the most diverse and abundant eukaryotes on earth. The
interplay between mold exposure and the host immune system is still not fully
elucidated. Literature research focusing on up-to-date publications is providing 
a heterogenous picture of evidence and opinions regarding the role of mold and
mycotoxins in the development of immune diseases. While the induction of allergic
immune responses by molds is generally acknowledged, other direct health effects 
like the toxic mold syndrome are controversially discussed. However, recent
observations indicate a particular importance of mold/mycotoxin exposure in
individuals with pre-existing dysregulation of the immune system, due to
exacerbation of underlying pathophysiology including allergic and non-allergic
chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and even human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression. In this review, we focus on the
impact of mycotoxins regarding their impact on disease progression in
pre-existing immune dysregulation. This is complemented by experimental in vivo
and in vitro findings to present cellular and molecular modes of action.
Furthermore, we discuss hypothetical mechanisms of action, where evidence is
missing since much remains to be discovered.
