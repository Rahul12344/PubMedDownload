BACKGROUND: Vaccination intention is key to the success of any vaccination
programme, alongside vaccine availability and access. Public intention to take a 
COVID-19 vaccine is high in England and Wales compared to other countries, but
vaccination rate disparities between ethnic, social and age groups has led to
concern.
METHODS: Online survey of prospective household community cohort study
participants across England and Wales (Virus Watch). Vaccination intention was
measured by individual participant responses to 'Would you accept a COVID-19
vaccine if offered?', collected in December 2020 and February 2021. Responses to 
a 13-item questionnaire collected in January 2021 were analysed using factor
analysis to investigate psychological influences on vaccination intention.
RESULTS: Survey response rate was 56% (20,785/36,998) in December 2020 and 53%
(20,590/38,727) in February 2021, with 14,880 adults reporting across both time
points. In December 2020, 1,469 (10%) participants responded 'No' or 'Unsure'. Of
these people, 1,266 (86%) changed their mind and responded 'Yes' or 'Already had 
a COVID-19 vaccine' by February 2021. Vaccination intention increased across all 
ethnic groups and levels of social deprivation. Age was most strongly associated 
with vaccination intention, with 16-24-year-olds more likely to respond "Unsure" 
or "No" versus "Yes" than 65-74-year-olds in December 2020 (OR: 4.63, 95 %CI:
3.42, 6.27 & OR 7.17 95 %CI: 4.26, 12.07 respectively) and February 2021 (OR:
27.92 95 %CI: 13.79, 56.51 & OR 17.16 95 %CI: 4.12, 71.55). The association
between ethnicity and vaccination intention weakened, but did not disappear, over
time. Both vaccine- and illness-related psychological factors were shown to
influence vaccination intention.
CONCLUSIONS: Four in five adults (86%) who were reluctant or intending to refuse 
a COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020 had changed their mind in February 2021 and
planned to accept, or had already accepted, a vaccine.
