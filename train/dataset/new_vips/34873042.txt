To generate infectious virus, HIV-1 must package two copies of its full-length
RNA into particles. HIV-1 transcription initiates from multiple, neighboring
sites, generating RNA species that only differ by a few nucleotides at the 5'
end, including those with one (1G) or three (3G) 5' guanosines. Strikingly, 1G
RNA is preferentially packaged into virions over 3G RNA. We investigated how
HIV-1 distinguishes between these nearly identical RNAs using in-gel chemical
probing combined with recently developed computational tools for determining RNA 
conformational ensembles, as well as cell-based assays to quantify the efficiency
of RNA packaging into viral particles. We found that 1G and 3G RNAs fold into
distinct structural ensembles. The 1G RNA, but not the 3G RNA, primarily adopts
conformations with an intact polyA stem, exposed dimerization initiation site,
and multiple, unpaired guanosines known to mediate Gag binding. Furthermore, we
identified mutants that exhibited altered genome selectivity and packaged 3G RNA 
efficiently. In these mutants, both 1G and 3G RNAs fold into similar
conformational ensembles, such that they can no longer be distinguished. Our
findings demonstrate that polyA stem stability guides RNA-packaging selectivity. 
These studies also uncover the mechanism by which HIV-1 selects its genome for
packaging: 1G RNA is preferentially packaged because it exposes structural
elements that promote RNA dimerization and Gag binding.
