Politics may color interpretations of facts, and thus perceptions of risk. We
find that a higher share of Trump voters in a county is associated with lower
perceptions of risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for COVID-19 case
counts and deaths, as Trump's vote share rises in the local area, individuals
search less for information on the virus and its potential economic impacts, and 
engage in fewer visits to non-essential businesses. Our results suggest that
politics and the media may play an important role in determining the formation of
risk perceptions, and may therefore affect both economic and health-related
reactions to unanticipated health crises.
