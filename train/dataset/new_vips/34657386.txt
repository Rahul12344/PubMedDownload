Immunogenicity following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among solid organ
transplant recipients has not been assessed. Seventy-five patients (37 kidney
transplant [KT] recipients and 38 healthy controls) received two doses, at 4-week
intervals, of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2-specific 
humoral (HMI) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) were measured before, 4 weeks
post-first dose, and 2 weeks post-second dose. The median (IQR) age of KT
recipients was 50 (42-54) years and 89% were receiving calcineurin
inhibitors/mycophenolate/corticosteroid regimens. The median (IQR) time since
transplant was 4.5 (2-9.5) years. Among 35 KT patients, the median (IQR) of
anti-RBD IgG level measured by CLIA after vaccination was not different from
baseline, but was significantly lower than in controls (2.4 [1.1-3.7] vs. 1742.0 
[747.7-3783.0] AU/ml, p < .01) as well as percentages of neutralizing antibody
inhibition measured by surrogate viral neutralization test (0 [0-0] vs. 71.2
[56.8-92.2]%, p < .01). However, the median (IQR) of SARS-CoV-2 mixed
peptides-specific T cell responses measured by ELISpot was significantly
increased compared with baseline (30 [4-120] vs. 12 [0-56] T cells/106  PBMCs,
p = .02) and not different from the controls. Our findings revealed weak HMI but 
comparable CMI responses in fully vaccinated KT recipients receiving inactivated 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to immunocompetent individuals (Thai Clinical
Trials Registry, TCTR20210226002).
