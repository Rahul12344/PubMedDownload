Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat that requires
coordinated action across One Health sectors (humans, animals, environment) to
stem its spread. Environmental surveillance of AMR is largely behind the curve in
current One Health surveillance programs, but recent momentum in the
establishment of infrastructure for monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage 
provides an impetus for analogous AMR monitoring. Simultaneous advances in
research have identified striking trends in various AMR measures in wastewater
and other impacted environments across global transects. Methodologies for
tracking AMR, including metagenomics, are rapidly advancing, but need to be
standardized and made modular for access by LMICs, while also developing systems 
for sample archiving and data sharing. Such efforts will help optimize effective 
global AMR policy.
