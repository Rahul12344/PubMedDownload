Naive and memory CD4+ T cells reactive with human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) are detectable in unexposed, unimmunized individuals. The contribution of
preexisting CD4+ T cells to a primary immune response was investigated in 20
HIV-1-seronegative volunteers vaccinated with an HIV-1 envelope (Env) plasmid DNA
prime and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost in the HVTN 106 
vaccine trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02296541). Prevaccination naive or memory
CD4+ T cell responses directed against peptide epitopes in Env were identified in
14 individuals. After priming with DNA, 40% (8/20) of the elicited responses
matched epitopes detected in the corresponding preimmunization memory
repertoires, and clonotypes were shared before and after vaccination in 2
representative volunteers. In contrast, there were no shared epitope
specificities between the preimmunization memory compartment and responses
detected after boosting with recombinant MVA expressing a heterologous Env.
Preexisting memory CD4+ T cells therefore shape the early immune response to
vaccination with a previously unencountered HIV-1 antigen.
