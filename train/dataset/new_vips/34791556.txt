The antiviral activity of recombinant human IFN-lambda type 1 (IFNλ-1) against
culture strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined by infecting a highly sensitive
VeroE6 coronavirus cell culture after preincubation test (the cell monolayer was 
incubated with 4-fold dilutions of IFNλ-1 in a concentration range of 0.16-42,500
ng/ml in a culture medium for 12 h at 37°C) and without preincubation
(simultaneous addition of different concentrations of IFNλ-1 and SARS-CoV-2
infection in a dose of 102 TCID50). The created recombinant human IFNλ-1
demonstrated obvious antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In the
tests with and without preincubation, IFNλ-1 exhibited significant activity,
although somewhat lower in variant with simultaneous addition of IFNλ-1 and virus
to the cell culture. It should be noted that the antiviral effect of IFNλ-1 was
observed in a wide range of concentrations.
