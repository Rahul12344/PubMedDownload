It is well known that black and green tea extracts, particularly polyphenols,
have antimicrobial activity against various pathogenic microbes including
viruses. However, there is limited data on the antiviral activity against severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged rapidly in
China in late 2019 and which has been responsible for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic globally. In this study, 20 compounds and three extracts were
obtained from black and green tea and found that three tea extracts showed
significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, whereby the viral titre
decreased about 5 logs TCID50 per ml by 1·375 mg ml-1 black tea extract and
two-fold diluted tea bag infusion obtained from black tea when incubated at 25°C 
for 10 s. However, when concentrations of black and green tea extracts were
equally adjusted to 344 µg ml-1 , green tea extracts showed more antiviral
activity against SARS-CoV-2. This simple and highly respected beverage may be a
cheap and widely acceptable means to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in the mouth 
and upper gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts in developed as well as
developing countries.
