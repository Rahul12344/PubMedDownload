The Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH), a universal
test and treat (UTT) trial, implemented 'Streamlined Care'-a multicomponent
strategy including rapid linkage to care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) start, 
3-monthly refills, viral load counseling, and accessible, patient-centered care
provision. To understand patient and provider experiences of Streamlined Care to 
inform future care innovations, we conducted in-depth interviews with patients
(n = 18) and providers (n = 28) at baseline (2014) and follow-up (2015) (n = 17
patients; n = 21 providers). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated, and
deductively and inductively coded. Streamlined Care helped to decongest clinic
spaces and de-stigmatize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care. Patients
credited the individualized counselling, provider-assisted HIV status disclosure,
and providers' knowledge of patient's drug schedules, availability, and phone
call reminders for their care engagement. However, for some, denial (repeated
testing to disprove HIV+ results), feeling healthy, limited understanding of the 
benefits of early ART, and anticipated side-effects, and mistrust of researchers 
hindered rapid ART initiation. Patients' short and long-term mobility proved
challenging for both patients and providers. Providers viewed viral load
counselling as a powerful tool to convince otherwise healthy and high-CD4
patients to initiate ART. Patient-centered HIV care models should build on the
successes of Streamlined Care, while addressing persistent
barriers.#NCT01864683-https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01864603.
