This study explores the level and frequency of anxiety about COVID-19 infection
in some Middle Eastern countries, and differences in this anxiety by country,
gender, workplace, and social status. Another aim was to identify the predictive 
power of anxiety about COVID-19 infection, daily smartphone use hours, and age in
smartphone addiction. The participants were 651 males and females from Jordan,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. The participants' ages ranged 
between 18 and 73 years (M 33.36, SD = 10.69). A questionnaire developed by the
authors was used to examine anxiety about COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the
Italian Smartphone Addiction Inventory was used after being translated, adapted, 
and validated for the purposes of the present study. The results revealed that
the percentages of participants with high, average, and low anxiety about
COVID-19 infection were 10.3%, 37.3%, and 52.4%, respectively. The mean scores of
anxiety about COVID-19 infection in the four countries were average: Egypt (M =
2.655), Saudi Arabia (M = 2.458), the United Arab Emirates (M = 2.413), and
Jordan (M = 2.336). Significant differences in anxiety about COVID-19 infection
were found between Egypt and Jordan, in favor of Egypt. Significant gender
differences were found in favor of females in the Jordanian and Egyptian samples,
and in favor of males in the Emirati sample. No significant differences were
found regarding workplace and social status. The results also revealed a
significant positive relationship between anxiety about COVID-19 infection, daily
smartphone use hours, and age on the one hand, and smartphone addiction on the
other. The strongest predictor of smartphone addiction was anxiety about COVID-19
infection, followed by daily use hours. Age did not significantly contribute to
the prediction of smartphone addiction. The study findings shed light on the
psychological health and cognitive aspects of anxiety about COVID-19 infection
and its relation to smartphone addiction.
