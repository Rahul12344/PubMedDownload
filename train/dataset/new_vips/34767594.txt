BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients vary greatly with age and
underlying comorbidities. We aimed to determine the demographic and clinical
factors, particularly baseline chronic conditions, associated with an increased
risk of severity in COVID-19 patients from a population-based perspective and
using data from electronic health records (EHR).
METHODS: Retrospective, observational study in an open cohort analyzing all
68,913 individuals (mean age 44.4 years, 53.2% women) with SARS-CoV-2 infection
between 15 June and 19 December 2020 using exhaustive electronic health
registries. Patients were followed for 30 days from inclusion or until the date
of death within that period. We performed multivariate logistic regression to
analyze the association between each chronic disease and severe infection, based 
on hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: 5885 (8.5%) individuals showed severe infection and old age was the most
influencing factor. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio -OR- men: 1.28, OR
women: 1.39), diabetes (1.37, 1.24), chronic renal failure (1.31, 1.22) and
obesity (1.21, 1.26) increased the likelihood of severe infection in both sexes. 
Chronic skin ulcers (1.32), acute cerebrovascular disease (1.34), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (1.21), urinary incontinence (1.17) and neoplasms
(1.26) in men, and infertility (1.87), obstructive sleep apnea (1.43), hepatic
steatosis (1.43), rheumatoid arthritis (1.39) and menstrual disorders (1.18) in
women were also associated with more severe outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Age and specific cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased the
risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women, whereas the effects of
certain comorbidities are sex specific. Future studies in different settings are 
encouraged to analyze which profiles of chronic patients are at higher risk of
poor prognosis and should therefore be the targets of prevention and shielding
strategies.
