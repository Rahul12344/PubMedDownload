Trauma-informed practices have been widely adopted in clinical, educational and
research domains of nursing practice, supporting trauma-informed care for
patients and contributing to the knowledge base for trauma-informed care
practices. However, trauma-informed concepts and frameworks have not been taken
up as readily by nursing leadership in the administration and policy domains,
presenting an opportunity for the exploration of the ways in which
trauma-informed leadership might shape nursing leadership practice. In this
paper, the concept of trauma-informed leadership is defined and considered as a
possible direction for nursing leadership practice in the context of the 21st
century, wherein increasing complexity and rapidly accelerating social
divisiveness require leadership practices that centre compassion, well-being and 
justice. A real-world example from the COVID-19 pandemic response provides an
opportunity to consider trauma-informed nursing leadership in practice as an
approach to supporting individual, population and system wellness and resilience.
