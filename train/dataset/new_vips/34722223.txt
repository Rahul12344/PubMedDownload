Mucormycosis is an uncommon but a fatal fungal infection that usually affects
patients with altered immunity. The Rhizopus Oryzae is most common type and
responsible for nearly 60% of mucormycosis cases in humans and also accounts for 
90% of the Rhino-orbital-cerebral (ROCM) form. Our aim and objective was to
study, the site of mucormycosis in nose and paranasal sinuses, adjacent site like
orbit palate or intracranial involvement, co-morbid condition and management to
be done in confirm mucormycosis patients. The most common sinuses involved are
the ethmoid, maxillary followed by the frontal and sphenoid sinus. Diabetes
mellitus is often associated with mucormycosis of the paranasal sinuses, as is
corona virus infection; uncontrolled diabetes further increases the risk.
Intra-orbital involvement is common, but intracranial involvement is rare.
Extensive steroid and broad-spectrum antibiotic use for Covid-19 management may
cause or exacerbate fungal disease. All the patients required surgical
intervention along with medical treatment.
