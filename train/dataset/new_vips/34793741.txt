Since the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the USA in January, 2020, over
46 million people in the country have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorisations from the US 
Food and Drug Administration, with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine receiving full
approval on Aug 23, 2021. When paired with masking, physical distancing, and
ventilation, COVID-19 vaccines are the best intervention to sustainably control
the pandemic. However, surveys have consistently found that a sizeable minority
of US residents do not plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The most severe
consequence of an inadequate uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has been sustained
community transmission (including of the delta [B.1.617.2] variant, a surge of
which began in July, 2021). Exacerbating the direct impact of the virus, a low
uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will prolong the social and economic repercussions of
the pandemic on families and communities, especially low-income and minority
ethnic groups, into 2022, or even longer. The scale and challenges of the
COVID-19 vaccination campaign are unprecedented. Therefore, through a series of
recommendations, we present a coordinated, evidence-based education,
communication, and behavioural intervention strategy that is likely to improve
the success of COVID-19 vaccine programmes across the USA.
