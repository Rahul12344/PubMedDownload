The food poisoning outbreaks due to the consumption of norovirus-contaminated
shellfish continue to occur. Male-specific (F+) coliphage has been suggested as
an indicator of viral species due to the association with animal and human
wastes. This study compared the double agar overlay method and the quantitative
real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based method to evaluate microbial contamination tracking 
applicability of F+ coliphage-based detection methods in shellfish samples. The
RT-PCR based method showed 1.6-39 times higher coliphage PFU values from spiked
shellfish samples, in relation to the double agar overlay method. These
differences indicated that the RT-PCR based technique can detect both intact
viruses and non-particles protected viral DNA/RNA, suggested that the RT-PCR
based method is expected to be a more efficient tool in microbial contamination
tracking in shellfish. However, the virome information of F+
coliphage-contaminated oyster samples revealed that the high specificity of
RT-PCR based method has a limitation in microbial contamination tracking due to
the genomic diversity of F+ coliphages. Further research on the development of
appropriate primer sets for microbial contamination tracking is necessary. This
study provides the preliminary insight that should be examined for suitable
microbial contamination tracking methods to control the sanitation of shellfish
and related seawater.
