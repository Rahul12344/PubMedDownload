Pregnant women are expected to have a high level of awareness when it comes to
checking their fetal health and ensuring their welfare. This study explored the
experiences of pregnant women in Indonesia who were monitoring their fetal
wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitativedescriptive study design
with a constructivist paradigm was used. Twenty-two pregnant women were recruited
and participated in a semi-structured interview. Analysis of the transcribed
interviews used a content, thematic and comparative process. Three themes emerged
from the analysis: feelingsand responses, changes to the ante natal care service 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fetal wellbeing monitoring, tools, and
methods used. Advice on how pregnant women should conduct fetal wellbeing
monitoring during COVID-19 is urgently needed. The results of this study indicate
there is a need for interventions to help pregnant women carry out self-fetal
wellbeing monitoring in times where they have fewer contacts with health
professionals such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.
