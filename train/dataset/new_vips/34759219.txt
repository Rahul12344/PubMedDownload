ABSTRACT: Low-level viremia (LLV) was defined as persistent or intermittent
episodes of detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (<2000 IU/mL, detection limit 
of 10 IU/mL) after 48 weeks of antiviral treatment. Effective antiviral therapies
for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, such as entecavir (ETV), tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), have been shown to
inhibit the replication of HBV DNA and prevent liver-related complications.
However, even with long-term antiviral therapy, there are still a number of
patients with persistent or intermittent LLV. At present, the research on LLV to 
address whether adversely affect the clinical outcome is limited, and the
follow-up treatment for these patients is open to question. At the same time, the
mechanism of LLV is not clear. In this review, we summarize the incidence of LLV,
the association between LLV and long-term outcomes, possible mechanisms, and
management strategies in these patient populations.
