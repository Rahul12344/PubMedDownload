In this study, we investigated the role of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in
porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) replication. We found that PEDV infection
induced strong HSP70 overexpression in the very early stage of infection. We also
confirmed that HSP70 overexpression increased the speed of PEDV replication,
resulting in the generation of more virions. In contrast, knockout of HSP70 in
cells significantly downregulated PEDV protein expression, resulting in a
significant reduction in PEDV replication. Most importantly, we confirmed that
among the structural proteins of PEDV, membrane (M) proteins have this important 
role. We found that membrane proteins control cellular HSP70 expression in
PEDV-infected cells. We confirmed HSP70/M complex formation by both
immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Additionally, PEDV M
overexpression induced strong HSP70 expression. All our results clearly confirmed
that in PEDV-infected cells, the M protein plays a very important role in PEDV
replication in collaboration with HSP70.
