BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus infection remains common in patients with chronic
kidney disease, including those on maintenance dialysis. The relationship between
hepatitis C virus infection and chronic kidney disease is bi-directional; in
fact, HCV is both a cause and consequence of chronic kidney disease. According to
a systematic review with meta-analysis of observational studies (n = 23 studies) 
(n = 574,081 patients on long-term dialysis), anti-HCV positive serologic status 
was an independent and significant risk factor for death in patients with
advanced chronic kidney disease on long-term dialysis. The overall estimate for
adjusted mortality (all-cause death risk) with HCV was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.18; 1.34) 
(p < 0.0001). Interferon-based therapies are biased by low efficacy/safety in
chronic kidney disease, but the advent of direct-acting antiviral drugs has made 
a paradigm shift in the treatment of HCV-infection. These medications give
interruption of viral replication because they target specific non-structural
viral proteins; four classes of DAAs exist-NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A
inhibitors, NS5B nucleoside and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. All-oral,
interferon-free, ribavirin-free combinations of DAAs are now available.
AIM: The goal of this narrative review is to report the available treatment
options for HCV in advanced chronic kidney disease.
METHODS: We have made an extensive review of the medical literature and various
research engines have been adopted.
RESULTS: Some combinations of DAAs are currently recommended for HCV in advanced 
CKD (including patients on maintenance dialysis): elbasvir/grazoprevir;
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; and sofosbuvir-based regimens. Solid evidence, based on
registration and "real life" studies supports their efficacy (SVR rates > 90%)
and safety even in patients with advanced CKD. No dosage adjustment is necessary 
and treatment duration is 8-12 weeks. However, recent data highlight that many
patients with advanced CKD remain untreated, and numerous barriers to antiviral
treatment of HCV still exist. Whether successful antiviral therapy with DAAs will
translate into improved survival in the advanced CKD population is another point 
of future research.
