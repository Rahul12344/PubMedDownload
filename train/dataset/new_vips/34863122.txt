A community-based healthcare package combining testing and prevention tools,
including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), immediate HIV treatment, management of
hepatitis B virus, and sexual and reproductive health (SRH), targeting female sex
workers (FSWs) in Côte d'Ivoire: the ANRS 12381 PRINCESSE project.

BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended by the WHO for HIV
prevention among female sex workers (FSWs). A study conducted in 2016-2017 in
Côte d'Ivoire showed that if PrEP is acceptable, FSWs also have many uncovered
sexual health needs. Based on this evidence, the ANRS 12381 PRINCESSE project was
developed in collaboration with a community-based organization. The main
objective is to develop, document, and analyze a comprehensive sexual and
reproductive healthcare package among FSWs in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: PRINCESSE is an open, single-arm interventional cohort of 500 FSWs in
San Pedro (Côte d'Ivoire) and its surroundings. Recruitment started on November
26th, 2019 and is ongoing; the cohort is planned to last at least 30 months. The 
healthcare package (including HIV, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted
infection management, pregnancy screening, and contraception) is available both
at mobile clinics organized for a quarterly follow-up (10 intervention sites,
each site being visited every two weeks) and at a fixed clinic. Four waves of
data collection were implemented: (i) clinical and safety data; (ii)
socio-behavioral questionnaires; (iii) biological data; and (iv) in-depth
interviews with female participants. Four additional waves of data collection are
scheduled outside the cohort itself: (i) the medical and activity records of
Aprosam for the PRINCESSE participants; (ii) the medical records of HIV+ FSW
patients not participating in the PRINCESSE cohort, and routinely examined by
Aprosam; (iii) in-depth interviews with key informants in the FSW community; and 
(iv) in-depth interviews with PRINCESSE follow-up actors.
DISCUSSION: The PRINCESSE project is one of the first interventions offering HIV 
oral PrEP as part of a more global sexual healthcare package targeting both HIV- 
and HIV+ women. Second, STIs and viral hepatitis B care were offered to all
participants, regardless of their willingness to use PrEP. Another innovation is 
the implementation of mobile clinics for chronic/quarterly care. In terms of
research, PRINCESSE is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary project combining
clinical, biological, epidemiological, and social specific objectives and
outcomes to document the operational challenges of a multidisease program in
real-life conditions.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The PRINCESSE project was registered on the Clinicaltrial.gov
website ( NCT03985085 ) on June 13, 2019.
