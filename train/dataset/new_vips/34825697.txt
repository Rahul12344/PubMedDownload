OBJECTIVE: To map evidence on the use of digital technologies in the care of
people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: This is a scoping review, based on the JBI manual, which included
scientific articles and gray literature from nine primary and seven secondary
databases. Articles were independently assessed by two reviewers. Rayyan® was
used to select the studies. The description of study characterization is
presented in a table and tables, ending in a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: A total of 1,964 studies were identified and, after selection, 23
publications remained for analysis. It turned out that telemedicine was used in
all studies and remote consultation support technologies included continuous
glucose monitoring devices, glucose data analysis software, insulin delivery
systems, applications, audio and/or voice communication devices, which
facilitated remote diabetes mellitus monitoring and management.
CONCLUSION: Telehealth, monitoring technologies, insulin delivery systems and
communication devices were tools used to monitor patients with diabetes during
the pandemic.
