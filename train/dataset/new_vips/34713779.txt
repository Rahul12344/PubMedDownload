In this paper, Mixed Reality (MR) has been exploited in the operating rooms to
perform laparoscopic and open surgery with the aim of providing remote mentoring 
to the medical doctors under training during the Covid-19 pandemic. The employed 
architecture, which has put together MR smartglasses, a Digital Imaging Player,
and a Mixed Reality Toolkit, has been used for cancer surgery at the IRCCS
Hospital 'Giovanni Paolo II' in southern Italy. The feasibility of using the
conceived platform for real-time remote mentoring has been assessed on the basis 
of surveys distributed to the trainees after each surgery.
