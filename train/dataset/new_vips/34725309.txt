The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is presently the most pressing public
health concern worldwide. Cytokine storm is an important factor leading to death 
of patients with COVID-19. This study aims to characterize serum cytokines of
patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Clinical records were obtained from
149 patients who were tested at the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji
Hospital from 30 January to 30 March 2020. Data regarding the clinical features
of the patients was collected and analyzed. Among the 149, 45 (30.2%) of them had
severe conditions and 104 (69.8%) of that presented critical symptoms. In the
meantime, 80 (53.7%) of that 149 died during hospitalization. Of all, male
patients accounted for 94 (69.1%). Compared with patients in severe COVID-19,
those who in critical COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-10. Moreover, the
passed-away patients had considerably higher levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and
IL-10 than those survived from it. Regression analysis revealed that serum TNF-α 
level was an independent risk factor for the death of patient with severe
conditions. Among the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6)
analyzed herein, TNF-α was seen as a risk factor for the death of patients with
severe or critical COVID-19. This study suggests that anti-TNF-α treatment allows
patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia to recover.
