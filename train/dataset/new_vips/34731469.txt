We describe an approach to early stage drug discovery that explicitly engages
with the complexities of human biology. The combined computational and
experimental approach is formulated on a conceptual framework in which network
biology is used to bridge between individual molecular entities and the cellular 
phenotype that emerges when those entities interact in a network. Multiple
aspects of early stage discovery are addressed including the data-driven
elucidation of biological processes implicated in disease, target identification 
and validation, phenotypic discovery of active molecules and their mechanism of
action, and extraction of genetic target support from human population genetics
data. Validation is described via summary of a number of discovery projects and
details from a project aimed at COVID-19 disease.
