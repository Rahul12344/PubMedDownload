In early months of 2020, California experienced a mask-making revolution during
the Coronavirus pandemic. Media reports and personal pleas from the medical
community regarding personal protective equipment shortages and rationing
activated a female-led, voluntary response to protect frontline medical and
essential workers, loved ones, and vulnerable populations. Mask makers impressed 
themselves into action, operating independent of the formal channels for
emergency response to fill the gap in communities across the state using social
media and crowdsourcing to match offers of assistance with needs. Makers provided
protection to thousands of Californians using locally organized Facebook groups
to share patterns, collaborate, problem solve, coordinate mask requests and
distribution, and build community when the supply chain fell short. While many
legitimate obstacles prevent the formal response community from coordinating with
emergent volunteers, recognizing how efficient and effective they were during
COVID-19 benefits the whole commu-nity approach to emergency management.
