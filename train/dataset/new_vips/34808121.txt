Membrane-enveloped viruses are a major cause of global health challenges,
including recent epidemics and pandemics. This mini-review covers the latest
efforts to develop membrane-targeting antiviral peptides that inhibit enveloped
viruses by 1) preventing virus-cell fusion or 2) disrupting the viral membrane
envelope. The corresponding mechanisms of antiviral activity are discussed along 
with peptide engineering strategies to modulate membrane-peptide interactions in 
terms of potency and selectivity. Application examples are presented
demonstrating how membrane-targeting antiviral peptides are useful therapeutics
and prophylactics in animal models, while a stronger emphasis on biophysical
concepts is proposed to refine mechanistic understanding and support potential
clinical translation.
