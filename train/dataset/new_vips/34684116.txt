Background and Objectives: Vitamin D, in addition to its effect on mineral
homeostasis, plays a key role in muscle metabolism. Vitamin D supplementation is 
involved in muscle recovery after damage as a consequence of either pathology or 
after high-intensity exercise. In this context, the aim of this study was to
analyze the effect of vitamin D on muscle fitness in elderly patients in the
recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods: This
pilot study was conducted at the Soria Norte Health Center. The study consisted
of a double-blind trial with two groups of men (placebo and vitamin
D-supplemented) (n = 15/group). Treatment with vitamin D (cholecalciferol: 2000
IU/day) and placebo was carried out for 6 weeks. Circulating hematological and
biochemical parameters (total protein, glucose, vitamin D, urea, uric acid,
aspartate aminotransferase/glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alanine
aminotransferase/glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate
dehydrogenase, aldolase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and myoglobin) and the
hormones cortisol and testosterone were determined. As for respiratory function
tests, FEV1 and respiratory flow were also studied. For physical fitness tests,
the "six-minute walk test" (6MWT) was used. Results: After vitamin D
supplementation, we observed that serum creatine kinase levels returned to
optimal values. This change suggests a protective role of vitamin D against
muscle catabolism compared to placebo. In terms of physical test results, we
observed only slight non-significant improvements, although patients reported
feeling better. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation produces decreases in
indicators of muscle damage, which may ultimately contribute to improving the
health status and quality of life of patients who have suffered from COVID-19,
during the recovery process.
