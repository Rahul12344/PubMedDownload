Model-estimated relationship between elementary school-related SARS-CoV-2
transmission, mitigation interventions, and vaccination coverage across community
incidence levels.

Background: While CDC guidance for K-12 schools recommends indoor masking
regardless of vaccination status, final decisions about masking in schools will
be made at the local and state level. The impact of the removal of mask
restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students,
educators/staff, and their households is not well known.
Methods: We used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of
SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students
across 12 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels
(reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and four student
vaccination levels (0%, 25%, 50% and 70% coverage). For each scenario, we varied 
observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases/100,000 people/day) and
mitigation effectiveness (0-100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate),
and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least 
one in-school transmission, and (2) average increase in total infections among
students, educators/staff, and their household members associated with moving
from more to less intensive mitigation measures.
Results: Over 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at
least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of estimated
additional infections in the immediate school community associated with changes
in mitigation measures varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and 
no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple
ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if
decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission
below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a
community incidence of approximately 2/100,000/day. Once students are vaccinated,
thresholds shift substantially higher.
Limitations: The interpretation of model results should be limited by the
uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual 
mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the 
limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed
case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with
decreased testing capacity.
Conclusion: Despite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both
in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students,
educators/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant
predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations
for students can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the 
potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local 
COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.
