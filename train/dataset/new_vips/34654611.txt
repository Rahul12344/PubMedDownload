BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has effected major changes to
healthcare delivery within acute care settings. Rapid response calls (RRCs) in
healthcare organisations have been effective at identifying and urgently managing
acute clinical deterioration. Code-95 RRC were introduced to prewarn healthcare
workers (HCWs) attending to patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19
infection.
AIMS: The primary aim of the study was to identify the personal impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs involved in attending Code-95 RRC. We sought to
evaluate their perception of risks and effects on wellbeing and identify
potential opportunities for improvement at organisational levels.
METHODS: We undertook a detailed survey on HCWs attending Code-95 RRCs, including
questions that sought to understand the impact of the pandemic as well as their
perception of infection risk and emotional wellbeing. This was a substudy of the 
prospective cross-sectional single-centre survey of HCWs that was conducted over 
a 3-week period at Frankston Hospital, Victoria, Australia. We adopted a
quantitative content analysis approach for free-text responses in this secondary 
analysis.
RESULTS: Four hundred two free-text comments were received from 297 respondents
and were analysed. More than two-thirds (68%, 223/297) were female. Of all
comments, 39% (155/402) were related to organisational issues including
communication, confusion due to constantly changing infection control policies,
and insufficient training. Thirty-three percent of comments (133/402) raised
issues regarding the adequacy of personal protective equipment. Anxiety was
reported in 25% of comments (101/402) with concerns predominantly relating to
emotional stress and fatigue, risks of virus exposure and transmitting the
infection to others, and COVID-19 precautions impairing care delivery.
CONCLUSION(S): Our study raises important issues that have relevance for all
healthcare organisations in the management of patients with COVID-19. These
include the importance of improving communication, especially when infection
control policies are revised, optimising training, maintaining adequate personal 
protective equipment, and HCW support. Early recognition and management of these 
issues are crucial to maintain optimal healthcare delivery.
