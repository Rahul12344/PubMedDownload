Protecting healthcare professionals is crucial in maintaining a functioning
healthcare system. The risk of infection and optimal preventive strategies for
healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic remain poorly understood. Here we
report the results of a cohort study that included pre- and asymptomatic
healthcare workers. A weekly testing regime has been performed in this cohort
since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify infected healthcare
workers. Based on these observations we have developed a mathematical model of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission that integrates the sources of infection from inside and 
outside the hospital. The data were used to study how regular testing and a
desynchronisation protocol are effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19
infection at work, and compared both strategies in terms of workforce
availability and cost-effectiveness. We showed that case incidence among
healthcare workers is higher than would be explained solely by community
infection. Furthermore, while testing and desynchronisation protocols are both
effective in preventing nosocomial transmission, regular testing maintains work
productivity with implementation costs.
