Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza A
virus (swIAV) are major pathogens of the porcine respiratory disease complex, but
little is known on their interaction in super-infected pigs. In this study, we
investigated clinical, virological and immunological outcomes of successive
infections with PRRSV-1 and H1N2 swIAV. Twenty-four specific pathogen-free
piglets were distributed into four groups and inoculated either with PRRSV at
study day (SD) 0, or with swIAV at SD8, or with PRRSV and swIAV one week apart at
SD0 and SD8, respectively, or mock-inoculated. In PRRSV/swIAV group, the clinical
signs usually observed after swIAV infection were attenuated while higher levels 
of anti-swIAV antibodies were measured in lungs. Concurrently, PRRSV
multiplication in lungs was significantly affected by swIAV infection, whereas
the cell-mediated immune response specific to PRRSV was detected earlier in
blood, as compared to PRRSV group. Moreover, levels of interferon (IFN)-α
measured from SD9 in the blood of super-infected pigs were lower than those
measured in the swIAV group, but higher than in the PRRSV group at the same time.
Correlation analyses suggested an important role of IFN-α in the two-way
interference highlighted between both viral infections.
