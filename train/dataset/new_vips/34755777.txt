OBJECTIVE: to analyze the evidence available in the literature about
postoperative complications in adult patients undergoing surgical procedures with
confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2.
METHOD: an integrative literature review conducted in the CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS,
PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases, as well as in the gray literature.
The references identified were exported to the EndNote manager and, subsequently,
to the Rayyan web application for study selection. The stages of sampling,
categorization of studies, evaluation of the studies included, interpretation of 
the results and knowledge synthesis were performed by two reviewers independently
and in a masked manner. The data were analyzed descriptively.
RESULTS: of the 247 articles identified, 15 were selected to comprise this
review. The prevalent postoperative complications in patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 were the following: cough, dyspnea and hypoxia, need for invasive
mechanical ventilation or not, admission to the intensive care unit and death.
CONCLUSION: the most reported postoperative complications in the studies
evaluated were respiratory-related, followed by cardiovascular complications. The
importance of preoperative screening for COVID-19 is highlighted, as well as of
the monitoring and tracking of confirmed cases in the postoperative period, as
these actions exert an impact on reducing the occurrence of complications related
to SARS-CoV-2.
