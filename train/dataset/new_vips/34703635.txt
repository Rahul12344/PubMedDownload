Objective: To determine whether environmental surface contamination with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred at a provincial
hospital in Viet Nam that admitted patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) and at the regional reference laboratory responsible for confirmatory 
testing for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.
Methods: Environmental samples were collected from patient and staff areas at the
hospital and various operational and staff areas at the laboratory. Specimens
from frequently touched surfaces in all rooms were collected using a moistened
swab rubbed over a 25 cm2 area for each surface. The swabs were immediately
transported to the laboratory for testing by real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Throat specimens were collected from staff at
both locations and were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR.
Results: During the sampling period, the laboratory tested 6607 respiratory
specimens for SARS-CoV-2 from patients within the region, and the hospital
admitted 9 COVID-19 cases. Regular cleaning was conducted at both sites in
accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. All 750
environmental samples (300 laboratory and 450 hospital) and 30 staff specimens
were negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Discussion: IPC measures at the facilities may have contributed to the negative
results from the environmental samples. Other possible explanations include
sampling late in a patient's hospital stay when virus load was lower, having
insufficient contact time with a surface or using insufficiently moist collection
swabs. Further environmental sampling studies of SARS-CoV-2 should consider
including testing for the environmental presence of viruses within laboratory
settings, targeting the collection of samples to early in the course of a
patient's illness and including sampling of confirmed positive control surfaces, 
while maintaining appropriate biosafety measures.
