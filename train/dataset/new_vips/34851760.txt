Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a herpesvirus of swine. PRV is also called suid
herpesvirus 1 and is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily within the
family Herpesviridae. The number of PRV cases worldwide is small, but in
susceptible individuals, infection with this virus has a poor prognosis.
Therefore, it is urgent to improve our understanding of this disease in clinical 
practice to avoid misdiagnosis and to identify optimal treatments. We report a
patient with PRV infection who was admitted to hospital with viral encephalitis
and subsequently developed intraocular infection. Because to the lack of relevant
clinical experience in the treatment of this disease, we carried out experimental
treatment with good therapeutic effect. This case provides a basis for clinical
diagnosis and treatment of patients with PRV.
