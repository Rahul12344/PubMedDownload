Advances in antiretroviral treatment improved the life expectancy of perinatally 
HIV-infected children. However, growing up with HIV provides challenges in daily 
functioning. This cross-sectional cohort study investigated the
neuropsychological and psychosocial functioning of a group of perinatally
HIV-infected children in the Netherlands and compared their outcomes with Dutch
normative data and outcomes of a control group of uninfected siblings. The
children's functioning was assessed with internationally well-known and
standardized questionnaires, using a multi-informant approach, including the
perspectives of caregivers, teachers, and school-aged children. In addition, we
explored the associations of socio-demographic and medical characteristics of the
HIV-infected children with their neuropsychological and psychosocial functioning.
Caregivers reported compromised functioning when compared to Dutch normative data
for HIV-infected children in the areas of attention, sensory processing,
social-emotional functioning, and health-related quality of life. Teachers
reported in addition compromised executive functioning for HIV-infected children.
A comparison with siblings revealed differences in executive functioning,
problems with peers, and general health. The concurrent resemblance between
HIV-infected children and siblings regarding problems in other domains implies
that social and contextual factors may be of influence. A family-focused approach
with special attention to the child's socio-environmental context and additional 
attention for siblings is recommended.
