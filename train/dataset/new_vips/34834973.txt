Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is a deltaretrovirus that is closely related to
human T-cell leukaemia virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and -2). It causes enzootic
bovine leukosis (EBL), which is the most important neoplastic disease in cattle. 
Most BLV-infected cattle are asymptomatic, which potentiates extremely high
shedding rates of the virus in many cattle populations. Approximately 30% of them
show persistent lymphocytosis that has various clinical outcomes; only a small
proportion of animals (less than 5%) exhibit signs of EBL. BLV causes major
economic losses in the cattle industry, especially in dairy farms. Direct costs
are due to a decrease in animal productivity and in cow longevity; indirect costs
are caused by restrictions that are placed on the import of animals and animal
products from infected areas. Most European regions have implemented an efficient
eradication programme, yet BLV prevalence remains high worldwide. Control of the 
disease is not feasible because there is no effective vaccine against it.
Therefore, detection and early diagnosis of the disease are essential in order to
diminish its spreading and the economic losses it causes. This review comprises
an overview of bovine leukosis, which highlights the epidemiology of the disease,
diagnostic tests that are used and effective control strategies.
