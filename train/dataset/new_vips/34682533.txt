Following rising unemployment rates and consequent loss of income due to
COVID-19, many people have been seeking meal assistance. This study examines the 
impact of a community-based free meal distribution program during the pandemic in
Kentucky, reviewing characteristics of recipients of the program. Demographics,
health behaviors, food insecure classification, and rating of importance of the
meal program were collected. Qualitative feedback on the impact of the program
was collected via open response. Of the 92 participants using the meal service,
the cohort was female, Black, 43 years of age (43.5 ± 15.0 years), with a
household income under 30,000 USD before COVID, decreased income since COVID, and
were food insecure. Recipients rated the importance of the service as 8.7 ± 1.8
(of 10), and those with children indicated the importance as 4.2 ± 1.1 (of 5).
Qualitative data on program importance highlighted four response categories
including "changed habits", "mental wellbeing", "provided resources", and
"other". In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals have struggled.
Meal assistance programs are a fundamental asset in the community that have seen 
marketed demand since COVID-19. Collaboration with, and evaluation of, meal
assistance programs can be valuable for continued programmatic funding support.
