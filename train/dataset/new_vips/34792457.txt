The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has fuelled demands for national
threshold standards of quality for long-term care in Canada. The federal
government, however, lacks jurisdiction for and experience with the provision of 
long-term care, which rests constitutionally with the provinces. A creative
approach to providing new funding and effective regulatory standard setting would
seize the potential of an area of jurisdiction shared by federal and provincial
governments - old age security - to establish a long-term care insurance program 
administered by the federal government and jointly governed by federal and
provincial governments.
