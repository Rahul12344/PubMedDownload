Global trade suffered a significant contraction in 2020 as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and its growth is expected to remain below the pre-pandemic
trend. Did the relative importance of countries in the world trade network change
as a result of the pandemic? The answer to this question is particularly
important for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries
because of their relative importance in world trade as well as their strong trade
linkages with China, where the COVID-19 virus originated. This paper examines how
the world trade network has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a
particular focus on ASEAN countries. Tracking the changes in centrality from
January 2000 to March 2021, we find no evidence for most ASEAN and major trading 
countries that centrality changed significantly after the pandemic began. Our
results suggest the resilience of the trade pattern for these countries.
