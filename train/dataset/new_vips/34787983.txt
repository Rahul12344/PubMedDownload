BACKGROUND: There are important information gaps concerning the prevalence and
distribution of infection control practices (ICPs) within workplaces continuing
to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DATA AND METHODS: To address these gaps, this paper examines the prevalence of
workplace ICPs among employed respondents to Statistics Canada's Labour Force
Survey in the months of July, August and September 2020 (n = 53,316). The article
also seeks to identify sociodemographic, occupational and workplace factors
associated with the level and type of workplace ICPs. ICPs included the
reorganization of the workplace to allow for physical distancing, increased
access to hand sanitizer or handwashing facilities, enhanced cleaning protocols
and access to personal protective equipment. Multivariable regression models were
used to examine the number of ICPs in place and the absence of specific ICPs.
RESULTS: Generally high levels of reported protections among workers (15% of the 
sample had three ICPs and 72% had four or more ICPs) were observed. However,
certain subgroups of workers were less likely to have ICPs in place. These
included workers who were male; those with lower levels of education, shorter job
tenure, or non-permanent work; and those working in the agricultural,
construction, transportation and warehousing, and education industries.
INTERPRETATION: In a large sample of Canadian employees, generally high levels of
workplace ICPs to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 were observed. Groups with 
lower levels of ICPs included workers at the start of their employment, workers
with low levels of education, and certain industry groups.
