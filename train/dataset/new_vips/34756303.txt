PURPOSE: During coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, hospitals faced
challenges which were different than previous years. The purpose this study was
to report frequency of firearm injuries (FI) to head and neck during the COVID-19
pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study reviewed patients in the Trauma
Registry at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, GA. Patients were included 
if they sustained FI to head and neck, were listed in TR, and were treated at
GMH. Patients were stratified according to date of injury into 1) before COVID-19
pandemic, (BC19) or 2) during initial 5 months of COVID-19 pandemic, (C19).
Variables were patient demographics, illegal substance use, etiology, place of
injury, distressed communities index, location of injury, Glasgow Coma scale on
arrival, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Emergency Department (ED), shock on
admission, disposition from ED, length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation
and discharge status. Descriptive, univariate, and bivariate analysis were
completed. Chi square test was used for categorical variables. Statistical
significance was P < .05.
RESULTS: There were 215 patients who met inclusion criteria. There were 96
patients (78 males) with a mean age of 31.5 years old during BC19. There were 119
patients (101 males) with a mean age 32.7 years old during C19. There was a 10.4%
increase in FI to head and neck during COVID-19. Our data showed that alcohol use
was associated with FI during C19 (P≤ .0001). FI to base of skull occurred 34.5% 
more often during C19 (P = .002). Cranial injuries occurred 26% more often during
BC19 (P = .03). During BC19, 85.4% of the patients arrived alive to GMH, but only
16% arrived alive during C19 (P ≤ .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: There were more FI to head and neck during COVID-10 pandemic than
during the previous time period.
