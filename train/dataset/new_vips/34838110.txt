BACKGROUND: Some pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal adverse events were observed
in potential association with injection of COVID-19 vaccines, while there was no 
preventive intervention for it. We aim to investigate the efficacy of auricular
acupressure (AA) therapy in preventing and relieving AEFI after injection of
COVID-19 vaccine.
METHODS: The study design is a randomized, multicentre, three-arm controlled,
single-blind trial. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be
advertised and enrolled and assigned in the medical institutions randomly for
post-injection observation. No less than 360 participants will be randomized into
one of three groups: auricular acupressure group, sham auricular acupressure
group, and wait-list group. Interventions will be performed immediately and will 
happen 4 to 5 times per day for 5 days. The primary clinical outcomes will be
quality and quantity evaluation among participants who reported any AEFI and who 
reported local pain at injection site. Secondary outcomes will concern headache, 
muscle and (or) joint pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and other
potential events. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 1, 3, 5, 7,
and 14 days after the injection. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol
analyses will be performed, with significance level determined as 5%.
DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will help to clarify the value of auricular
acupressure therapy in preventing and relieving overall and certain adverse
events following immunization after injection of COVID-19 vaccine.
