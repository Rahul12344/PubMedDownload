The viral pandemic has resulted in a growing demand for antiviral drugs. The
existing small-molecule antiviral drugs are limited, due to their incidence of
drug resistance and adverse side effects. As potential drugs, antiviral peptides 
have the benefits of high activity, high stability, and few side effects.
Furthermore, the diversity of acquisition methods allows antiviral peptides to be
quickly designed and yielded. The drug properties (such as high bioavailability
and in vivo stability) of antiviral peptides can be improved by the developed
modifications. Currently, two peptide antiviral drugs have been approved for the 
treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many antiviral peptides
have entered clinical trials for the treatment of diseases caused by viruses. In 
addition, new antiviral peptides are continuously being identified and validated 
against virus infections. Given the benefits of antiviral peptides, they will
become major antiviral drugs to combat new outbreaks caused by unknown viruses in
the future. This review provides an overview of recent developments in antiviral 
peptides with in vivo activity.
