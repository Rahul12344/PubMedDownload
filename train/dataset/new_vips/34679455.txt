Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing
antibody (NAb) production is a crucial humoral response that can reduce
re-infection or breakthrough infection. The conventional test used to measure NAb
production capacity levels is the live virus-neutralizing assay. However, this
test must be conducted under biosafety level-3 containment. Pseudovirus or
surrogate NAb tests, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition tests,
can be performed under level-2 containment. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the performance of a surrogate SARS-CoV-2 NAb assay (sNAb) using samples from
naturally infected individuals and vaccine recipients in comparison with the live
virus microneutralization assay (vMN). Three hundred and eighty serum samples
which were collected from 197 patients with COVID-19, 96 vaccine recipients and
84 normal individuals were analyzed. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the sNAb
(iFlash-2019-NAb assay, Shenzhen, China) were 97.9%, 94.9%, 98.2%, and 93.8%,
respectively. Agreement for the assay relative to vMN for naturally infected
individuals and vaccine recipients were 98.5% and 93.9%, respectively. A
correlation analysis between sNAb and the vMN for both of these groups yielded an
R2 value of 0.83. The iFlash RBD NAb assay is found to be sensitive and reliable 
for neutralizing antibody measurement in patients with the 2019 coronavirus
disease and those who have been vaccinated against it.
