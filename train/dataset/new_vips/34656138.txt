BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has stripped many medical students worldwide of
their right to quality education. In response, we developed hybrid courses
involving aspects of both online and in-person teaching for radiation oncology
medical student clerkship.
METHODS: We entitled students to customize their own rotation schedule using
Google Forms and developed a flipped learning online class, which consisted of at
least one video clip on basic knowledge of radiation oncology per day
(yonsei-radonc.com). Students were instructed to watch online videos before the
next day's discussion session. Required components of the medical education
program (e.g., target drawing, site visits to treatment facilities) were also
prepared and conducted in accordance with the appropriate level of social
distancing measures. Finally, we conducted questionnaire surveys after the
completion of the week-long course and clerkship.
RESULTS: From March to June 2020, 110 fourth-year medical students undertook a
clinical module in our 1-week radiation oncology program course. Each day,
students completed the flipped learning prior to meeting with the educator and
then participated in the online discussion session and conference. All activities
were well performed as scheduled. Students' motivation was high, as was their
overall satisfaction with the course. The students were satisfied with the online
contents, flipped learning strategy, and instructors.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully integrated open and virtual educational platforms to
improve access to and satisfaction with student clerkship. In the future "new
normal," minimized face-to-face learning interactions, such as flipped learning, 
should be actively utilized for medical and other students' education.
