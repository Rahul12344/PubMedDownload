Adenine nucleotide translocase-1 (ANT1) is an ADP/ATP transporter protein located
in the inner mitochondrial membrane. ANT1 is involved not only in the processes
of ADP/ATP exchange but also in the composition of the mitochondrial membrane
permeability transition pore (mPTP); and the function of ANT1 is closely related 
to its own conformational changes. Notably, various viral proteins can interact
directly with ANT1 to influence mitochondrial membrane potential by regulating
the opening of mPTP, thereby affecting tumor cell fate. The Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) encodes the key tumorigenic protein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1),
which plays a pivotal role in promoting therapeutic resistance in related tumors.
In our study, we identified a novel mechanism for EBV-LMP1-induced alteration of 
ANT1 conformation in cisplatin resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Here, we
found that EBV-LMP1 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane and inhibits
the opening of mPTP by binding to ANT1, thereby favoring tumor cell survival and 
drug resistance. The ANT1 conformational inhibitor carboxyatractyloside (CATR) in
combination with cisplatin improved the chemosensitivity of EBV-LMP1-positive
cells. This finding confirms that ANT1 is a novel therapeutic target for
overcoming cisplatin resistance in the future.
