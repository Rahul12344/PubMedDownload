The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is jeopardizing the effectiveness of current
vaccines and limiting the application of monoclonal antibody-based therapy for
COVID-19 (refs. 1,2). Here we analysed the memory B cells of five naive and five 
convalescent people vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to investigate the 
nature of the B cell and antibody response at the single-cell level. Almost 6,000
cells were sorted, over 3,000 cells produced monoclonal antibodies against the
spike protein and more than 400 cells neutralized the original SARS-CoV-2 virus
first identified in Wuhan, China. The B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.1.248 (Gamma)
variants escaped almost 70% of these antibodies, while a much smaller portion was
impacted by the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. The overall loss 
of neutralization was always significantly higher in the antibodies from naive
people. In part, this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found
only in people who were convalescent and generated potent and broadly
neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggest that people who are seropositive
following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased
potency and breadth and will be able to better control emerging SARS-CoV-2
variants.
