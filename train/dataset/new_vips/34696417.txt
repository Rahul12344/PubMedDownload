Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are unconventional T cells that help control
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in adults. γδ T cells develop early in gestation,
and a fetal public γδ T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype is detected in congenital
CMV infections. However, age-dependent γδ T cell responses to primary CMV
infection are not well-understood. Flow cytometry and TCR sequencing was used to 
comprehensively characterize γδ T cell responses to CMV infection in a cohort of 
32 infants followed prospectively from birth. Peripheral blood γδ T cell
frequencies increased during infancy, and were higher among CMV-infected infants 
relative to uninfected. Clustering analyses revealed associations between CMV
infection and activation marker expression on adaptive-like Vδ1 and Vδ3, but not 
innate-like Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cell subsets. Frequencies of NKG2C+CD57+ γδ T cells were 
temporally associated with the quantity of CMV shed in saliva by infants with
primary infection. The public γδ TCR clonotype was only detected in CMV-infected 
infants <120 days old and at lower frequencies than previously described in fetal
infections. Our findings support the notion that CMV infection drives
age-dependent expansions of specific γδ T cell populations, and provide insight
for novel strategies to prevent CMV transmission and disease.
