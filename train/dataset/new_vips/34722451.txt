Objectives: To quantify parental acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and assess
the vaccine hesitancy (VH) for COVID-19 vs. childhood vaccines. Methods: Eight
vaccine hesitancy scale (VHS) items, adopted from WHO's Strategic Advisory Group 
of Immunization (SAGE), were used to assess VH for COVID-19 vaccine vs. routine
childhood vaccines. We distributed the online survey to parents with the commence
of the national childhood COVID-19 vaccination program in Saudi Arabia. Results: 
Among 3,167 parents, 47.6% are decided to vaccinate their children against
COVID-19. The most common reasons for refusal were inadequate safety information 
(69%) and worry about side effects (60.6%). Parents have a significantly greater 
positive attitudes toward children's routine vaccines vs. the COVID-19 vaccine,
with higher mean VHS (±SD) = 2.98 ± 0.58 vs. 2.63 ± 0.73, respectively (p-value <
0.001). Parents agreed more that routine childhood vaccines are more essential
and effective as compared to the COVID-19 vaccine (Cohen's D: 0.946, and 0.826,
consecutively; T-test p-value < 0.00). There is more parental anxiety about
serious side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine vs. routine childhood vaccines
(Cohen's D = 0.706, p-value < 0.001). Parents who relied on the Ministry of
Health information were more predicted (OR = 1.28, p-value = 0.035) to intend to 
vaccinate as opposed to those who used the WHO website (OR = 0.47, -53%, p-value 
< 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the factors associated 
with intention to vaccinate children were parents who received COVID-19 vaccine, 
older parents, having children aged 12-18, and parents with lower education
levels. Conclusions: Significant proportion of parents are hesitant about the
COVID-19 vaccine because they are less confident in its effectiveness, safety,
and whether it is essential for their children. Relying on the national official 
healthcare authority's website for the source of information was associated with 
increased acceptance of childhood COVID-19 vaccination. As parental intention to 
vaccinate children against COVID-19 is suboptimal, healthcare authorities could
boost vaccine uptake by campaigns targeting hesitant parents.
