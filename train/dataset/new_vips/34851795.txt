PURPOSE: To report a case of acute retinal necrosis (ARN) due to varicella zoster
virus (VZV) after COVID-19 vaccine administration.
DESIGN/METHODS: Observational case report.
RESULT: A 62-year-old immunocompetent African American male presented with left
eye redness, decreased vision, and floaters after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine
seven days prior. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse fine endothelial keratic
precipitates. Funduscopic examination was notable for vitreous cells, occlusive
retinal vasculitis, large retinal hemorrhages, and three quadrants of peripheral 
areas of retinal whitening. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing was
positive for varicella zoster virus in the vitreous humor. Treatment with
intravitreal and intravenous antiviral therapy resulted in symptomatic
improvement.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 mRNA vaccination may cause an immunomodulatory response that
leads to reactivation of dormant VZV. Early recognition and treatment can improve
visual outcomes.
