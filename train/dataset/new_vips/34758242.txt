BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that
brings a significant public health challenge. A rapid and simple method is
necessary for testing suspected samples and screening the population.
METHODS: To better monitor sample effectiveness, this study described a method to
detect nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACTB gene
employing real-time duplex reverse transcription multienzyme isothermal rapid
amplification (RT-MIRA) assays.
RESULTS: The established real-time duplex RT-MIRA assays showed that no
cross-reactions were observed to other pathogens and the detection limit was 100 
copies/reaction. Using simulated clinical samples to test established assays
further and the amplification process took no more than 20 minutes at 42Â°C.
CONCLUSIONS: RT-MIRA assays are faster and easier than reverse transcription
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It is expected to be further
optimized and evaluated in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases.
