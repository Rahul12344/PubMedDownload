The ever-evolving and contagious nature of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has
immobilized the world around us. As the daily number of infected cases increases,
the containment of the spread of this virus is proving to be an overwhelming
task. Healthcare facilities around the world are overburdened with an ominous
responsibility to combat an ever-worsening scenario. To aid the healthcare
system, Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a better solution-tracing,
testing of COVID patients efficiently is gaining rapid pace. This study discusses
the role of IoT technology in healthcare during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. The
study overviews different research, platforms, services, products where IoT is
used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we intelligently integrate IoT and
healthcare for COVID-19 related applications. Again, we focus on a wide range of 
IoT applications in regards to SARS-CoV-2 tracing, testing, and treatment.
Finally, we effectively consider further challenges, issues, and some direction
regarding IoT in order to uplift the healthcare system during COVID-19 and future
pandemics.
