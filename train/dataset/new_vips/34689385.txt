This paper examines the propagation of COVID-19 across the Spanish provinces and 
assesses the effectiveness of the Spanish lockdown of the population implemented 
on March 14, 2020 in order to battle this pandemic. To achieve these objectives, 
a standard spatial econometric model used in economics is adapted to resemble the
popular reproduction models employed in the epidemiological literature. In
addition, we introduce a counterfactual exercise that allows us to examine the
Gross domestic product (GDP) gains of bringing forward the date of the Spanish
Lockdown. We find that the number of COVID-19 cases would have been reduced by
70.4% in the absence of spatial propagation between the Spanish provinces. We
also determine that the lockdown prevented the propagation of the virus within
and between provinces. As such, the Spanish lockdown reduced the number of
potential COVID-19 cases by 82.8%. However, the number of coronavirus cases would
have been reduced by an additional 11.6% if the lockdown had been brought forward
to March 7, 2020. Finally, an earlier lockdown would have saved approximately
26,900,000,000 euros.
