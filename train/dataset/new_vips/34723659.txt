Community intravenous therapy is well-established in most regions of the UK.
Although there are national good practice recommendations detailing the service
provision of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), examples of
extended service delivery of other therapies are limited. This article describes 
the development of a community IV therapy service through integration with acute 
and primary care teams. IV therapies delivered in addition to antimicrobials
safely outside of the hospital setting are also discussed with scope for future
areas of development explored. The benefits of care closer to home for patients
during the global COVID-19 pandemic are examined, as well as the potential for
widening the whole gamut of practice for already established NHS community
services through the development of integrated working in a local care
organisation.
