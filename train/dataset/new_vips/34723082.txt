It was speculated that fewer COVID-19 infections may emerge in tropical countries
due to their hot climate, but India emerged as one of the leading hotspot. There 
is no concrete answer on the influence of meteorological parameters on COVID-19
even after more than a year of outbreak. The present study examines the impacts
of Meteorological parameters during the summer and monsoon season of 2020, in
different Indian mega cities having distinct climate and geography. The results
indicate the sign of association, but it varies from one climatic zone to
another. The principal component analysis revealed that humidity is strongly
correlated with COVID-19 infections in hillocky city Pune (R = 0.70), dry Delhi
(R = 0.50) and coastal Mumbai (R = 0.46), but comparatively weak correlation is
found in arid climatic city of Ahmedabad. As against the expectations, no
discernible correlation is found with temperature in any of the cities. As the
virus in 2020 in India largely travelled with droplets, the association with
absolute humidity in the dry regions has serious implications. Clarity in
understanding the impact of seasonality will greatly help epidemiological
research and in making strategies to control the pandemic in India and other
tropical countries around the world.
