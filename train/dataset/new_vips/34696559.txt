INTRODUCTION: The most common form of infectious diseases of the nervous system
is meningitis and encephalitis. This study discusses in detail bacterial
meningitis and/or encephalitis in which the etiological factors are: Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and viral - in
Poland, most often caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus. In addition to
routine epidemiological surveillance of diseases caused by these etiological
factors, mandatory and recommended vaccinations are carried out in Poland aimed
at reducing the number of cases caused by N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, H.
influenzae and TBEV.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation
of meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2019.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The epidemiological situation of meningitis and
encephalitis in Poland was assessed on data sent to NIPH NIH - NRI by voivodeship
sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the annual bulletin
"Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2019" and "Vaccinations in Poland
in 2019".
RESULTS: In 2019, a total of 2,239 cases of meningitis and encephalitis were
registered in Poland. This is a decrease by approximately 19,9% compared to 2018.
In the case of bacterial infections, including neuroborreliosis, the number of
cases decreased by 27%, from 1265 to 921 cases. In the group of viral infections,
a decrease by 14% (from 1,533 to 1,318 cases) was recorded. In 31% of all the
cases of bacterial etiology, the etiological factor was one of three: Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections of 
viral etiology accounted for 58.9% of all registered cases. Compared to 2018, the
number of S. pneumoniae cases decreased by 14.6%, and in the case of N.
meningitidis by 6.9%. In the case of H. influenzae, there was an increase in the 
number of cases, compared to the previous year. In addition, there was a slight
increase in the number of cases of tick-borne encephalitis - from 197 cases in
2018 to 265 cases in 2019 (an increase of 34.5%).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The analysis showed a generally declining disease trend, 
both in bacterial and viral meningitis and encephalitis. Only in cases caused by 
H. influenzae and tick-borne encephalitis virus, an increase was observed
compared to the previous year. Meningitis and encephalitis continues to be a
challenge for the healthcare system, with particular emphasis on the correct
differentiation of the etiology at an early stage of infection detection.
