Viroids are RNA-based infectious agents that are single-stranded, covalently
closed circular, non-coding, and naked. Unlike RNA viruses, which at least encode
proteins for replication, encapsidation, and movement, lack of protein-coding
capacity of viroids makes them completely reliant on host for replication and
movement. The high genetic diversity in viroids is believed to be due to the
absence of proof-reading activity of the host RNA polymerases, the large
population size, and the rapid rate of replication. Protoplasts are viable plant 
cells that are prepared by enzymatic removal of cell walls. Plant protoplasts
provide a synchronous single-cell system for studying early events of viroid
infection such as replication and genetic diversity at the cellular level. A
simple and efficient method to isolate and transfect citrus protoplasts with
transcript RNA of citrus exocortis viroid is described in this chapter.
