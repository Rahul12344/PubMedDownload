BACKGROUND: The study aimed to investigate hepatitis C virus (HCV) specific
markers in chronically infected children. The main objective was to explore the
patterns of marker variability.
METHODS: HCV RNA, core antigen, anti-HCV IgM, and antibodies to individual viral 
proteins were detected using commercially available assays or experimental ELISA.
RNA genotyping and recombination were performed by sequencing.
RESULTS: HCV RNA and core antigen were detected in serum samples of all children 
(n=100). Anti-HCV IgM, anti-NS4AB IgG, and anti-NS5A IgG were revealed less often
than antibodies to core and NS3 proteins. To elucidate the cause of this finding,
all subjects were divided into 4 groups differing in hepatitis duration. It was
anti-NS4AB only whose detection depended on the infection duration. A trend was
established that the longer the hepatitis duration, the more frequently anti-HCV 
IgM was observed. No significant impact of HCV RNA load and NS4A/NS4B amino acid 
substitutions on anti-NS4AB IgG detection was found. The increase HCV genotype 3 
was observed among children infected after 2000. The earliest case of infection
caused by HCV intergenotype recombinant RF1_2k/1b was identified in a child
vertically infected in 1997.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV genotypes and subtypes were found to be variable virus specific 
markers in children infected in 1997-2015. Over the period, there has been a
trend to change the dominant HCV subtype and appearance of recombinant RF1_2k/1b 
in children. Among humoral markers, anti-NS4AB revealing is depended on chronic
hepatitis C duration, while for anti-HCV IgM, only a trend was established. The
detection of anti-NS4AB can be helpful in assessing the duration of chronic
hepatitis C.
