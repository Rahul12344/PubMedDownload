BACKGROUND: In December 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines arrived in
Romania and were made available to medical and social staff. Vaccine hesitancy
appeared as a barrier to effectively ending the pandemic. The opinions of medical
and social staff influence the opinion of the general population. This study
assesess the attitudes, knowledge, and opinion of medical and social personnel
toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination and the influencing factors.
METHODS: 1025 persons participated in an online cross-sectional study from March 
until July 2021.
RESULTS: Out of 1021 eligible responders, 719 (70.42%) had been vaccinated: 227
with one dose (22.23%) and 492 with two doses (48.18%). There were 302 responders
who were not vaccinated at all. Out of them, 188 refused vaccinations. The
participants showed a good understanding and knowledge of SARScoV-2 transmission 
and treatment. Geographic area, medical profession, and medical experience
influenced COVID-19 vaccination (p < 0.001). There were no associations between
willingness to vaccinate and vaccine/virus knowledge. Most of the responders who 
were vaccinated or wanted to be vaccinated indicated an mRNA vaccine as their
first choice. The variables that were significantly associated with reporting
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance after logistic regression were: living in an urban
area (Ora = 1.58, 95% CI: 0.98-2.56), being female (Ora = 1.59; 95%
CI:1.03-2.44), and being a medical doctor (Ora = 3.40; 95% CI: 1.84-6.26).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that vaccine hesitancy persists in medical and
social personnel in Romania, and, hence, it may be reflected in the hesitancy of 
the general population toward vaccination.
