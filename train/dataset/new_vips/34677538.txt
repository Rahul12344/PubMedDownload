Influenza A virus envelope contains lipid molecules of the host cell and three
integral viral proteins: major hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and minor M2
protein. Membrane-associated M1 matrix protein is thought to interact with the
lipid bilayer and cytoplasmic domains of integral viral proteins to form
infectious virus progeny. We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and
complementary techniques to analyze the interactions of different components of
the viral envelope with M1 matrix protein. Small unilamellar liposomes composed
of various mixtures of synthetic or "native" lipids extracted from Influenza
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virions as well as proteoliposomes built from the viral
lipids and anchored peptides of integral viral proteins (mainly, hemagglutinin)
were incubated with isolated M1 and measured using SAXS. The results imply that
M1 interaction with phosphatidylserine leads to condensation of the lipid in the 
protein-contacting monolayer, thus resulting in formation of lipid tubules. This 
effect vanishes in the presence of the liquid-ordered (raft-forming) constituents
(sphingomyelin and cholesterol) regardless of their proportion in the lipid
bilayer. We also detected a specific role of the hemagglutinin anchoring peptides
in ordering of viral lipid membrane into the raft-like one. These peptides
stimulate the oligomerization of M1 on the membrane to form a viral scaffold for 
subsequent budding of the virion from the plasma membrane of the infected cell.
