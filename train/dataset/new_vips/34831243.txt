The liver is targeted by several human pathogenic RNA viruses for viral
replication and dissemination; despite this, the extent of innate immune sensing 
of RNA viruses by human hepatocytes is insufficiently understood to date. In
particular, for highly human tropic viruses such as hepatitis C virus, cell
culture models are needed to study immune sensing. However, several human
hepatoma cell lines have impaired RNA sensing pathways and fail to mimic innate
immune responses in the human liver. Here we compare the RNA sensing properties
of six human hepatoma cell lines, namely Huh-6, Huh-7, HepG2, HepG2-HFL, Hep3B,
and HepaRG, with primary human hepatocytes. We show that primary liver cells
sense RNA through retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) like receptor (RLR) and 
Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathways. Of the tested cell lines, Hep3B cells most 
closely mimicked the RLR and TLR3 mediated sensing in primary hepatocytes. This
was shown by the expression of RLRs and TLR3 as well as the expression and
release of bioactive interferon in primary hepatocytes and Hep3B cells. Our work 
shows that Hep3B cells partially mimic RNA sensing in primary hepatocytes and
thus can serve as in vitro model to study innate immunity to RNA viruses in
hepatocytes.
