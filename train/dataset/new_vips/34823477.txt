BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of tick-borne pathogens are being discovered,
including those that infect humans. However, reports on co-infections caused by
two or more tick-borne pathogens are scarce.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old male farmer was bitten by a hard tick, presented
with fever (37.7 °C), severe headache and ejection vomiting. Lumbar puncture was 
performed in the lateral decubitus. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, and 
analysis showed severe increased pressure (320 mm H2O), mild leukocytosis
(126.0 × 106/L, mononuclear cells accounting for 73%) and elevated total protein 
concentration (0.92 g/L). Bacterial cultures of CSF and blood were negative. The 
diagnosis of Rickettsia raoultii and Tacheng tick virus 1 (TcTV-1) co-infection
was confirmed by amplifying four rickettsial genetic markers and the partial
small (S) RNA segment of TcTV-1 from the patient's blood. The patient gradually
recovered after treatment with levofloxacin and ribavirin.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported co-infection case with fever and
meningitis caused by R. raoultii and TcTV-1. It is vital to screen for multiple
pathogens in tick-bitten patients, especially in those with severe complex
symptoms.
