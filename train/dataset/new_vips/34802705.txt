To protect both patients and staff, healthcare personnel (HCP) were among the
first groups in the United States recommended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We
analyzed data reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System on COVID-19 vaccination coverage among 
hospital-based HCP. After vaccine introduction in December 2020, COVID-19 vaccine
coverage rose steadily through April 2021, but the rate of uptake has since
slowed; as of September 15, 2021, among 3,357,348 HCP in 2,086 hospitals included
in this analysis, 70.0% were fully vaccinated. Additional efforts are needed to
improve COVID-19 vaccine coverage among HCP.
