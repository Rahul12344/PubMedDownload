Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of the adaptive immunity for
survival against Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. To evaluate the contribution of
tissue damage to EBOV-induced immune suppression, acute liver damage or
hemolysis, two symptoms associated with lethal EBOV infection, were chemically
induced in vaccinated mice. Results show that either liver damage or hemolysis
was sufficient to inhibit the host humoral response against EBOV glycoprotein and
to drastically reduce the level of circulating T cells. This study thus provides 
a possible mechanism for the limited specific antibody production and lymphopenia
in individuals with lethal hemorrhagic fever infections.
