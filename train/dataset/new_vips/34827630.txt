Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are monocopper enzymes secreted by
many organisms and viruses. LPMOs catalyze the oxidative cleavage of different
types of polysaccharides and are today divided into eight families (AA9-11,
AA13-17) within the Auxiliary Activity enzyme class of the CAZy database. LPMOs
minimal architecture encompasses a catalytic domain, to which can be appended a
carbohydrate-binding module. Intriguingly, we observed that some LPMO sequences
also display a C-terminal extension of varying length not associated with any
known function or fold. Here, we analyzed 27,060 sequences from different LPMO
families and show that 60% have a C-terminal extension predicted to be
intrinsically disordered. Our analysis shows that these disordered C-terminal
regions (dCTRs) are widespread in all LPMO families (except AA13) and differ in
terms of sequence length and amino-acid composition. Noteworthily, these dCTRs
have so far only been observed in LPMOs. LPMO-dCTRs share a common polyampholytic
nature and an enrichment in serine and threonine residues, suggesting that they
undergo post-translational modifications. Interestingly, dCTRs from AA11 and AA15
are enriched in redox-sensitive, conditionally disordered regions. The widespread
occurrence of dCTRs in LPMOs from evolutionarily very divergent organisms, hints 
at a possible functional role and opens new prospects in the field of LPMOs.
