Introduction: HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide,
with chronic viral hepatitis accounting for more than 70% of the cases.
Therapeutic options are limited and ineffective. The increasing use of
immune-based therapies in solid tumors highlights the need to expand our
knowledge on the immunologic microenvironment of HCC.
Methods: Access to liver samples from 20 well-characterized patients with HCC
associated with HCV (n = 9) or HBV (n = 11) gave us the opportunity to study the 
immunologic landscape in these tumors. For each patient, RNA-sequencing was
performed on the tumor and surrounding nontumorous tissue.
Results: We found that both HCV- and HBV-HCC are associated with a predominance
of downregulated genes (74% and 67%, respectively). Analysis of the immune
landscape using a curated gene list showed 216 of 2481 (9%) immune genes in
HCV-HCC and 164 of 2560 (6%) in HBV-HCC. However, only 8 immune genes (4%) were
upregulated in HCV-HCC and 27 (16.5%) in HBV-HCC. HCV-HCC was characterized by an
enrichment of downregulated genes related to T-cell activation and oxidative
stress. The dramatic downregulation of immune genes related to T-cell activation 
in HCV-HCC prompted us to perform an extensive immunohistochemistry analysis on
paraffin-embedded liver specimen. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction
of immune-cell infiltration (CD3, CD8 and CD20 positive cells) within the tumor. 
Moreover, we observed that HCV-HCC is characterized by an enrichment of M2-like
CD68-positive cells. These data are consistent with the dramatic downregulation
of immune-cell infiltration seen in HCV-HCC. Conversely, HBV-HCC was
characterized by upregulation of genes related to monocyte/macrophage activation 
and cell cycle control, and downregulation of genes involved in various cell
metabolisms.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates a distinctive molecular signature and immune 
landscape in HCC of different viral etiology, which could provide new insights
into pathogenesis and lead to the development of novel immune-based therapies.
