BACKGROUND: Bowel perforation from biliary stent migration is a serious potential
complication of biliary stents, but fortunately has an incidence of less than 1%.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 54-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of
Human Immunodeficiency virus with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis 
and extensive past surgical history who presented with acute abdominal pain and
local peritonitis. On further evaluation she was diagnosed with small bowel
perforation secondary to migrated biliary stents and underwent exploratory
laparotomy with therapeutic intervention.
CONCLUSION: This case presentation reports on the unusual finding of two migrated
biliary stents, with one causing perforation. In addition, we review the relevant
literature on migrated stents.
