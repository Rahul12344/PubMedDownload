Background: The bone bank unit of interest in this article was established in
January 2018, in a tertiary care teaching institute of north India. Aim of this
article is to describe the sources of allografts obtained, discard rates of
allografts and infection rates in the recipients after use.
Material and methods: All the relevant details of donors and recipients were
maintained, and donors were screened for standard inclusion and exclusion
criteria before obtaining the grafts. Aerobic culture was performed before
storage and just prior to use. Samples with incomplete documentation, incomplete 
donor screening or positive cultures were discarded. Data on surgical site
infection in recipients was collected from hospital records retrospectively.
Initially ELISA based serological tests were used for screening. Donor has to
undergo these tests again after 6 months to account for the window period of
proliferation of viruses. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for these viral
agents were introduced in the hospital in May 2018.
Results: Allografts from a total of 196 donors were obtained in the bone bank
over 2 years. Major source of bone was femoral heads harvested during total hip
arthroplasty or hemi-arthroplasty. 44(22.4%) grafts had to be discarded. 95
allografts were used in 88 patients during this time. Most common indication for 
use was surgery for bone tumors (40%), followed by complex primary or revision
arthroplasty (30.5%). Three (3.4%) recipients developed deep infection
postoperatively.
Conclusion: Frozen allograft bone from hospital based bone banks is a reliable
source of allografts. When meticulous precautions for sterility are followed,
risk of infection is low. Monitoring of such bone banks should fall within a
framework of the local legislature. Incomplete documentation is the major reason 
for wastage of the samples obtained. NAAT may be useful in screening of donors,
as it reduces the wastage and the holding time of the allografts.
