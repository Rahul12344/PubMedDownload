Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the risk
factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cervical carcinoma, respectively.
However, clinical analyses demonstrate that EBV or HPV is associated with
improved response of patients, although underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Here, we reported that the oncoproteins of DNA viruses, such as LMP1 of EBV and
E7 of HPV, inhibit PERK activity in cancer cells via the interaction of the viral
oncoproteins with PERK through a conserved motif. Inhibition of PERK led to
increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promoted tumor and enhanced
the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Consistently, disruption of viral
oncoprotein-PERK interactions attenuated tumor growth and chemotherapy in both
cancer cells and tumor-bearing mouse models. Our findings uncovered a paradoxical
effect of DNA tumor virus oncoproteins on tumors and highlighted that targeting
PERK might be an attractive strategy for the treatment of NPC and cervical
carcinoma.
