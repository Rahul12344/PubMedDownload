Herpes zoster oticus.

[Article in Norwegian]

Jahr SH, Wahl MS, Majid B, Samuelsen E.

BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster oticus is a rare neurological disease caused by
reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the facial nerve.
CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her 60Â s presented with left-sided seventh and
eighth cranial neuropathy. A vesicular rash in her left ear and palate appeared
one week after symptom onset. Lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
pleocytosis, mononuclear cells only, with PCR positive for varicella zoster
virus. Inflammation of the cochlear and vestibular systems and along the facial
nerve was detected by MRI. Antiviral treatment with valacyclovir in combination
with prednisolone was initiated. After one month with outpatient rehabilitation, 
the vertigo had ceased, but hearing loss and facial paralysis persisted.
INTERPRETATION: Early diagnosis and treatment of herpes zoster oticus as a cause 
of facial palsy when accompanied by ear rash, pain or signs of other cranial
nerve involvement may improve overall prognosis.
