Background/Aims: Anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapy is required for patients
with HBV infection receiving biologics because of the high risk of HBV
reactivation. However, it is unclear when to start biologics after anti-HBV
treatment. We investigated the risk of HBV reactivation according to the timing
of biologics initiation after anti-HBV treatment in immune-mediated inflammatory 
disease (IMID) patients with HBV infection.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of HBV reactivation in IMID
patients who received biologics between July 2005 and April 2020. The patients
were divided into two groups (within 1-week and after 1-week) according to the
timing of biologics initiation after anti-HBV treatment. The cumulative
probabilities and factors associated with HBV reactivation were evaluated.
Results: A total of 60 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with IMID
received biologics (within 1-week group, n=23 [38%]; after 1-week group, n=37
[62%]). During a median follow-up of 34 months (interquartile range, 20 to 74
months), three patients (5%) developed HBV reactivation. In univariate analysis, 
the timing of biologics after anti-HBV treatment was not significantly associated
with the risk of HBV reactivation (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95% confidence interval, 
0.059 to 7.327; p=0.733). The cumulative probabilities of HBV reactivation did
not significantly differ according to the timing of biologics (p=0.731).
Conclusions: The risk of HBV reactivation was not significantly associated with
the timing of biologics administration after anti-HBV treatment. Thus, biologics 
may be initiated early in patients with IMID undergoing treatment for HBV.
