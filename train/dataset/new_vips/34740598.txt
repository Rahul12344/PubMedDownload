The rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a dramatic negative
impact on public health and economies worldwide. Recent studies on COVID-19
complications and mortality rates suggest that there is a higher prevalence in
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) patients. Past investigations on the associations
between pre-existing CVDs and susceptibility to coronavirus infections including 
SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have
demonstrated similar results. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly
understood. This has impeded adequate risk stratification and treatment
strategies for CVD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Generally, dysregulation 
of the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the counter
regulator, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a hallmark of cardiovascular
risk and CVD. ACE2 is the main host receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Although further
studies are required, dysfunction of ACE2 after virus binding and dysregulation
of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) signaling may worsen the
outcomes of people affected by COVID-19 and with preexisting CVD. Here, we review
the current knowledge and outline the gaps related to the relationship between
CVD and COVID-19 with a focus on the RAAS. Improved understanding of the
mechanisms regulating viral entry and the role of RAAS may direct future research
with the potential to improve the prevention and management of COVID-19.
