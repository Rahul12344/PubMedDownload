Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a hemorrhagic fever.
Patients mainly develop fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. A high case
fatality rate of 16.2-47% has been reported. Vaccines and antivirals that are
effective against SFTS virus (SFTSV) are not yet available in clinical practice. 
We previously showed that o-dihydroxybenzene is the important chemical core
structure for anti-SFTSV activity. In this study, we evaluated the anti-SFTSV
efficacy of 3-Hydroxy-L-tyrosine (L-DOPA), a treatment for Parkinson's disease
and its enantiomer, 3-hydroxy-D-tyrosine (D-DOPA), both of which have an
o-dihydroxybenzene backbone. SFTSV was preincubated with L- or D-DOPA and then
inhibition of viral infection as well as viral attachment to host cells were
evaluated by viral quantification. Both L- and D-DOPA inhibited SFTSV infection
in a dose-dependent manner, mainly by blocking viral attachment to host cells.
The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of L-DOPA was 4.46-5.09 μM. IC50
of D-DOPA was 4.23-6.72 μM. IC50 of L-DOPA is very close to its maximum blood
concentration after oral administration as a therapy for Parkinson's disease.
D-DOPA, which IC50 was almost the same as that of L-DOPA, might not cause side
effect. Thus, our present study demonstrated that L- and D-DOPA are potentially
useful candidates for anti-SFTSV drugs.
