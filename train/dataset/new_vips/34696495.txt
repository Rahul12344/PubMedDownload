Two serious public health challenges have emerged in the current COVID-19
pandemic namely, deficits in SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring and neglect of other
co-circulating respiratory viruses. Additionally, accurate assessment of the
evolution, extent, and dynamics of the outbreak is required to understand the
transmission of the virus. To address these challenges, we evaluated 533 samples 
using a high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) respiratory viral panel 
(RVP) that includes 40 viral pathogens. The performance metrics revealed a PPA,
NPA, and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96%, and 94.4%, respectively. The clade for
pangolin lineage B that contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in
ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF3a, and S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein
mutation, were the most prevalent early in the pandemic in Georgia, USA. The
isolates from the same county formed paraphyletic groups, indicating virus
transmission between counties. The study demonstrates the clinical and public
health utility of the NGS-RVP to identify novel variants that can provide
actionable information to prevent or mitigate emerging viral threats and models
that provide insights into viral transmission patterns and predict
transmission/resurgence of regional outbreaks as well as providing critical
information on co-circulating respiratory viruses that might be independent
factors contributing to the global disease burden.
