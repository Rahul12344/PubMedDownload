OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the potential factors associated with 
mental health outcomes among Chinese adults during the Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) epidemic.
METHODS: This is an online cross-sectional survey conducted among Chinese adults 
in February 2020. Outcome measurements included the three-item UCLA Loneliness
Scale (UCLA-3), two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), two-item
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-2), and two items from the
Clinician-Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. COVID-19
related factors, physical health, lifestyle, and self-efficacy were also
measured. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed.
RESULTS: This study included 1456 participants (age: 33.8Â±10.5 years; female:
59.1%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and 
PTSD symptoms were 11.3%, 7.6%, 38.7%, and 33.9%, respectively. In multivariable 
analysis, loneliness was associated with being single,
separated/divorced/widowed, low level of education, current location, medication,
more somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and going out frequently. Depression 
was associated with fear of infection, binge drinking, more somatic symptoms,
lower self-efficacy, and longer screen time. Anxiety was associated with more
somatic symptoms and lower self-efficacy. PTSD symptoms were associated with more
somatic symptoms, lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk of infection, fear
of infection, and self-rated more negative influence due to the epidemic
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems during the COVID-19 epidemic were associated 
with various biopsychosocial and COVID-19 related factors. Psychological
interventions should be aware of these influencing factors and prioritize support
for those people at higher risk.
