Motivated by modelling epidemics like COVID-19, this paper proposes a generalized
chain binomial process which integrates two types of infectives, those with
symptoms and those without. Testing of infectives and vaccination of susceptibles
are then incorporated as preventive protective measures. Our interest relates to 
the distribution of the state of the population at the end of infection and to
the reproduction number [Formula: see text] with the associated extinction
condition. The method uses the construction of a family of martingales and a
branching approximation for large populations, respectively. A more general
branching process for epidemics is also constructed and studied. Finally, some
results obtained are illustrated by numerical examples.
