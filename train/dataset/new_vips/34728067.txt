A cross-sectional, survey based study was conducted in order to assess mental
health outcomes among healthcare workers in a private university hospital
involved in the COVID-19 response in Lebanon. The main objective was to quantify 
symptoms of anxiety and sleep quality using self-rating scales (the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) respectively),
while identifying factors that might affect those symptoms. A total of 628
healthcare workers completed the survey; 409 (66.2%) were younger than 40 years, 
and 441 (71.4%) were women. Of all participants, 503 (81.4%) were nurses, 52
(8.4%) were physicians and 63 (10.2%) were residents. Registered nurses,
residents, women, and younger participants presented higher scores on both scales
than other categories of participants. Among factors related with COVID-19, those
associated with higher scores were having relatives affected by the virus
(22.2%), being excessively exposed to media (12.9%), and increasing the
consumption of substances/alcohol (31.2%) during this period. Factors associated 
with higher risk of anxiety symptoms after multivariable logistic regression
analysis were: female sex, young age, poor sleep quality, and living with
elderly. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological
wellbeing of health care workers involved in the acute COVID-19 outbreak in
Lebanon.
