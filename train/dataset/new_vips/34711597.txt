INTRODUCTION: Mechanical ventilation of intensive care unit (ICU) patients
universally involves titration of the fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain
arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). However, the optimal SpO2 target remains
unknown.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Pragmatic Investigation of optimaL Oxygen Targets
(PILOT) trial is a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, cluster-crossover trial
being conducted in the emergency department (ED) and medical ICU at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. PILOT compares use of a
lower SpO2 target (target 90% and goal range: 88%-92%), an intermediate SpO2
target (target 94% and goal range: 92%-96%) and a higher SpO2 target (target 98% 
and goal range: 96%-100%). The study units are assigned to a single SpO2 target
(cluster-level allocation) for each 2-month study block, and the assigned SpO2
target switches every 2 months in a randomly generated sequence (cluster-level
crossover). The primary outcome is ventilator-free days (VFDs) to study day 28,
defined as the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation
from the final receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation through 28 days after
enrolment.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional 
Review Board. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed
journal and presented at one or more scientific conferences.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial protocol was registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov on 25 May 2018 prior to initiation of patient enrolment
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03537937).
