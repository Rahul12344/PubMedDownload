Two known Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs),
3,4,5-tribromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol (1d) and
3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol (2b), were isolated from the
Indonesian marine sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea. The structure was confirmed
using 13C chemical shift average deviation and was compared to the predicted
structures and recorded chemical shifts in previous studies. We found a wide
range of bioactivities from the organic crude extract, such as (1) a strong
deterrence against the generalist pufferfish Canthigaster solandri, (2) potent
inhibition against environmental and human pathogenic bacterial and fungal
strains, and (3) the inhibition of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The addition of a
bromine atom into the A-ring of compound 2b resulted in higher fish feeding
deterrence compared to compound 1d. On the contrary, compound 2b showed only more
potent inhibition against the Gram-negative bacteria Rhodotorula glutinis (MIC
2.1 μg/mL), while compound 1d showed more powerful inhibition against the other
human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The first report of a chemical defense by
compounds 1d and 2b against fish feeding and environmental relevant bacteria,
especially pathogenic bacteria, might be one reason for the widespread occurrence
of the shallow water sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea in Indonesia and the
Indo-Pacific.
