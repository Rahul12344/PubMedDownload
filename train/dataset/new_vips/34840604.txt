Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, there is a remarkable demand for 
robots, especially in the clinical sector. SARS-CoV-2 mainly propagates due to
close human interactions and contaminated surfaces, and hence, maintaining social
distancing has become a mandatory preventive measure. This generates the need to 
treat patients with minimal doctor-patient interaction. Introducing robots in the
healthcare sector protects the frontline healthcare workers from getting exposed 
to the coronavirus as well as decreases the need for medical personnel as robots 
can partially take over some medical roles. The aim of this paper is to highlight
the emerging role of robotic applications in the healthcare sector and allied
areas. To this end, a systematic review was conducted regarding the various
robots that have been implemented worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic to
attenuate and contain the virus. The results obtained from this study reveal that
the implementation of robotics into the healthcare field has a substantial effect
in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as it blocks coronavirus propagation
between patients and healthcare workers, along with other advantages such as
disinfection or cleaning.
