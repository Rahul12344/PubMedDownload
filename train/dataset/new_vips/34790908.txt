We developed a metatranscriptomics method that can simultaneously capture the
respiratory virome, microbiome, and host response directly from low biomass
samples. Using nasal swab samples, we capture RNA virome with sufficient
sequencing depth required to assemble complete genomes. We find a surprisingly
high frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronavirus (CoV) in
healthy children, and a high frequency of RSV-A and RSV-B co-detections in
children with symptomatic RSV. In addition, we have identified commensal and
pathogenic bacteria and fungi at the species level. Functional analysis revealed 
that H. influenzae was highly active in symptomatic RSV subjects. The host nasal 
transcriptome reveled upregulation of the innate immune system, anti-viral
response and inflammasome pathway, and downregulation of fatty acid pathways in
children with symptomatic RSV. Overall, we demonstrate that our method is broadly
applicable to infer the transcriptome landscape of an infected system, surveil
respiratory infections, and to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical
samples.
