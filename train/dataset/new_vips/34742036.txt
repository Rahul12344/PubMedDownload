Not all viruses associated with humans cause disease. Non-pathogenic
human-infecting viruses are predicted as important for immune system induction
and preparation. Phages that infect bacteria are the most abundant predators of
the human microbial ecosystem, promoting and maintaining bacterial diversity.
Metagenomic analyses of the human gut virome and microbiome are unravelling the
intricate predator-prey dynamics of phage-bacteria co-existence, co-evolution,
and their interplay with the human host. While most adults harbour a distinctly
individualistic and persistent community of virulent phages, new-borns are
dominated by temperate phages heavily influenced by environmental exposures. The 
future development of microbiome-based interventions, therapeutics, and
manipulation, will require a greater understanding of the human microbiome and
the virome.
