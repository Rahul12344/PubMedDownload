Robust and flexible continuous unit operations that enable the establishment of
intensified bioprocesses is one of the most relevant trends in manufacturing of
biopharmaceuticals, including virus-based products. Sulfated cellulose membrane
adsorbers (SCMA) are one of the most promising matrices for chromatographic
purification of virus particles, like influenza viruses. Here, a three 'column'
periodical counter current set-up was used to continuously purify influenza
A/PR/8/34 virus particles using SCMA in bind-elute mode. It was possible to
recover 67.4% of the HA-activity and to remove 67.4% and 99.8% of the total
protein and DNA, respectively. The performance of the continuous process operated
over a total of 10 loops, was slightly inferior to was obtained in a comparable
batch process. Nevertheless, it was possible to increase the effective usage of
binding capacity to 80%, resulting on a productivity of 22.8 kHAU mlmemb-1 min-1.
As a proof-of-principle, SCMA were successfully used as matrix for purification
of cell-derived influenza virus particles, in continuous mode.
