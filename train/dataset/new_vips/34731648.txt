It is urgent to develop disease models to dissect mechanisms regulating severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, we derive 
airway organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-AOs). The hPSC-AOs,
particularly ciliated-like cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using
this platform, we perform a high content screen and identify GW6471, which blocks
SARS-CoV-2 infection. GW6471 can also block infection of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2
variant. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis suggests that GW6471 blocks SARS-CoV-2
infection at least in part by inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha
(HIF1α), which is further validated by chemical inhibitor and genetic
perturbation targeting HIF1α. Metabolic profiling identifies decreased rates of
glycolysis upon GW6471 treatment, consistent with transcriptome profiling.
Finally, xanthohumol, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, and ND-646, three
compounds that suppress fatty acid biosynthesis, also block SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Together, a high content screen coupled with transcriptome and metabolic
profiling reveals a key role of the HIF1α-glycolysis axis in mediating SARS-CoV-2
infection of human airway epithelium.
