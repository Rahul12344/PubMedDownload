Background: More than a year after its first appearance in December 2019, the
COVID-19 pandemic is still on a rampage in many parts of the world. Although
several vaccines have been approved for emergency use, the emergence and rapid
spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants have sparked fears of vaccine failure due to
immune evasion. Massive viral genome sequencing has been recommended to track the
genetic changes that could lead to adverse consequences.
Methods: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 respiratory isolates from the National Public
Health Laboratory, Malaysia and examined them together with viral genomes
deposited in GISAID by other Malaysian researchers, to understand the
evolutionary trend of the virus circulating in the country. We studied the
distribution of virus lineages and site-wise mutations, analysed genetic
clustering with the goeBURST full Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, examined the
trend of viral nucleotide diversity over time and performed nucleotide
substitution association analyses.
Results: We identified 22 sub-lineages, 13 clonal complexes, 178 sequence types
and seven sites of linkage disequilibrium in 277 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced
between January and December 2020. B.1.524 was the largest lineage group. The
number of mutations per genome ranged from 0 to 19. The mean genomic diversity
value over 12 months was 3.26 × 10-4. Of 359 mutations detected, 60.5% of which
were non-synonymous, the most frequent were in the ORF1ab (P4715L), S (D614G and 
A701V) and N (S194L) genes.
Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulated an abundance of mutations in the
first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Its overall genetic diversity,
however, is relatively low compared to other Asian countries with larger
populations. Continuous genomic and epidemiological surveillance will help to
clarify the evolutionary processes determining viral diversity and impacting on
human health.
