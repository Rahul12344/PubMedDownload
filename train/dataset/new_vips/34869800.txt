In this article, the analysis of an arbitrary order Ebola virus disease model is 
conducted to find out its reliable solution. The fractional derivative is taken
in Liouville-Caputo sense. The solution of this nonlinear model is achieved using
fractional variational iteration scheme. The convergence analysis of the obtained
solution is also presented which confirms that it is positive, bounded and
convergent. The outcomes are discussed with figures explaining variation of
susceptible, infected, recovered population and number of disease induced deaths 
with time. The negligible error in successive iterations of various population
shows the competency of the presented scheme. The results endorse that FVIM is
extremely effective, powerful and easy in usage.
