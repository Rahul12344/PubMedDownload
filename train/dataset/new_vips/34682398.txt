Recruitment and retention of public health workers (PHWs) is crucial for the
optimal functioning of the public health system at a time of budget cuts and the 
threat of a pandemic. Individual and job-related variables were examined by
univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of the
intention to leave a job during the COVID-19 outbreak among Serbian PHWs in 25
institutes of public health (n = 1663 respondents, of which 73.1% were female). A
total of 20.3% of PHWs intended to leave their current job within the next five
years. Males and persons aged younger than 55 years who had additional practice
were more likely to report an intention to leave their job than females, those
older than 54 years and those without additional work. While uncertainty and fear
of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic were almost perceived as job
attractiveness, other job-related characteristics were identified as significant 
barriers to maintaining the sufficient capacity of qualified PHWs in the future. 
Authorities need to address these factors, including the following: the feeling
of tension, stress or pressure, and unavailability of information during the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as dissatisfaction with respect, valuation, and the
job in general.
