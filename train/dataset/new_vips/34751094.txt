As the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose a health and 
economic crisis worldwide, the quest for drugs and/or vaccines against the virus 
continues. The human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has attracted
attention as a target for drug discovery, as inhibition of its catalytic reaction
would result in the inactivation of the proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2â€‰S 
protein. As a result, the inactivation prevents viral cell entry to the host's
cell. In this work, we screened and identified two potent molecules that interact
and inhibit the catalytic reaction by using computational approaches. Two docking
screening experiments were performed utilizing the crystal structure and holo
ensemble structure obtained from molecular dynamics in bound form. There is
enhancement and sensitivity of docking results to the holo ensemble as compared
to the crystal structure. Compound 1 demonstrated a similar inhibition value to
nafamostat by interacting with catalytic triad residues His296 and Ser441,
thereby disrupting the already established hydrogen bond interaction. The
stability of the ligand-TMPRSS2 complexes was studied by molecular dynamics
simulation, and the binding energy was re-scored by using molecular mechanics
Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy. The obtained
compounds may serve as an initial point toward the discovery of potent TMPRSS2
inhibitors upon further in vivo validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
