Autophagy is an intracellular degradation and recycling process that can also
remove pathogenic intracellular bacteria and viruses from within cells (referred 
to as xenophagy) and activate the adaptive immune responses. But
autophagy-especially Atg proteins including Atg8 family members-can also have
proviral and probacterial effects. In this review, we summarize known
interactions of bacterial, parasitic, and viral proteins with Atg8 family
proteins and the outcome of these interactions on pathogen replication,
autophagy, or mitophagy. We discuss the value of prediction software and the
research methodology in the study of pathogen protein-Atg8 family protein
interactions, with selected examples of potential LC3-interacting region
motif-containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
