BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of lives
globally. However, the disease has presented more extreme challenges for
developing countries that are experiencing economic crises. Studies on COVID-19
symptoms and gut health are scarce and have not fully analyzed possible
associations between gut health and disease pathophysiology. Therefore, this
study aimed to demonstrate a potential association between gut health and
COVID-19 severity in the Lebanese community, which has been experiencing a severe
economic crisis.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive Lebanese
patients. Participants were interviewed and gut health, COVID-19 symptoms, and
different metrics were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression
models.
RESULTS: Analysis of the data showed that 25% of participants were asymptomatic, 
while an equal proportion experienced severe symptoms, including dyspnea (22.7%),
oxygen need (7.5%), and hospitalization (3.1%). The mean age of the participants 
was 38.3 ±0.8 years, and the majority were males (63.9%), married (68.2%), and
currently employed (66.7%). A negative correlation was found between gut health
score and COVID-19 symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = -0.153, P = 0.004); indicating
that low gut health was associated with more severe COVID-19 cases. Additionally,
participants who reported unhealthy food intake were more likely to experience
severe symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = 0.118, P = 0.049). When all items were taken
into consideration, multiple ordinal logistic regression models showed a
significant association between COVID-19 symptoms and each of the following
variables: working status, flu-like illness episodes, and gut health score.
COVID-19 severe symptoms were more common among patients having poor gut health
scores (OR:1.31, 95%CI:1.07-1.61; P = 0.008), experiencing more than one episode 
of flu-like illness per year (OR:2.85, 95%CI:1.58-5.15; P = 0.001), and owning a 
job (OR:2.00, 95%CI:1.1-3.65; P = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that showed the impact of 
gut health and exposure to respiratory viruses on COVID-19 severity in Lebanon.
These findings can facilitate combating the pandemic in Lebanon.
