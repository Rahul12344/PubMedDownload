Autophagy is a catabolic process that maintains internal homeostasis and energy
balance through the lysosomal degradation of redundant or damaged cellular
components. During virus infection, autophagy is triggered both in parenchymal
and in immune cells with different finalistic objectives: in parenchymal cells,
the goal is to destroy the virion particle while in macrophages and dendritic
cells the goal is to expose virion-derived fragments for priming the lymphocytes 
and initiate the immune response. However, some viruses have developed a strategy
to subvert the autophagy machinery to escape the destructive destiny and instead 
exploit it for virion assembly and exocytosis. Coronaviruses (like SARS-CoV-2)
possess such ability. The autophagy process requires a set of proteins that
constitute the core machinery and is controlled by several signaling pathways.
Here, we report on natural products capable of interfering with SARS-CoV-2
cellular infection and replication through their action on autophagy. The present
study provides support to the use of such natural products as adjuvant
therapeutics for the management of COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the virus
infection and replication, and so mitigating the progression of the disease.
