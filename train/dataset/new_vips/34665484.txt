There is growing interest in developing methods to 'wrap' nano- and micron-sized 
biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their
stability or improve performance. We describe the successful 'wrapping' of
lectin-decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron-sized
objects, within cross-linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains 
able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly
cross-linked to intermolecularly cross-linked, a process that is triggered by
polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that
both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the
crosslinker are required for successful 'wrapping' to occur. This work is
significant as it suggests that nano- and micron-sized biological objects such as
virus-like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells-all of which may benefit from
additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications-may
also be 'wrapped' by this approach.
