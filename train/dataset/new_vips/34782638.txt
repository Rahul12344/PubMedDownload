Host immune response and chronic inflammation associated with chronic hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection play a key role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases such 
as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We sampled 175 HCC, 117
cirrhotic and 165 non-cirrhotic controls from a prospective cohort study of
chronically HBV-infected individuals. Multivariable polytomous logistic
regression and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) were used to compare
baseline plasma levels for 102 markers in individuals who developed cirrhosis vs.
controls and those who developed HCC vs. cirrhosis. Leave-one-out cross
validation was used to generate receiver operating characteristic curves to
compare the predictive ability of marker groups. After multivariable adjustment, 
HGF (Q4v1OR: 3.74; p-trend = 0.0001), SLAMF1 (Q4v1OR: 4.07; p-trend = 0.0001),
CSF1 (Q4v1OR: 3.00; p-trend = 0.002), uPA (Q4v1OR: 3.36; p-trend = 0.002), IL-8
(Q4v1OR: 2.83; p-trend = 0.004), and OPG (Q4v1OR: 2.44; p-trend = 0.005) were all
found to be associated with cirrhosis development compared to controls; these
markers predicted cirrhosis with 69% accuracy. CDA analysis identified a nine
marker model capable of predicting cirrhosis development with 79% accuracy. No
markers were significantly different between HCC and cirrhotic participants. In
this study, we assessed immunologic markers in relation to liver disease in
chronically-HBV infected individuals. While validation in required, these
findings highlight the importance of immunologic processes in HBV-related
cirrhosis.
