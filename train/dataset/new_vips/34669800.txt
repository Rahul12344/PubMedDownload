COVID-19 is reported as an extremely contagious disease with common symptoms of
fever, dry cough, sore throat, and tiredness. The published literature on
incidence and gender-wise prevalence of COVID-19 is scarce in Pakistan.
Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the distribution, incubation
period and mortality rate of COVID-19 among the male and female population of
district Attock. The data were collected between 01 April 2020 and 07 December
2020 from the population of district Attock, Pakistan. A total of 22,962
individuals were screened and 843 were found positive for RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2.
The confirmed positive cases were monitored carefully. Among the positive cases, 
the incidence of COVID-19 was 61.7% among males and 38.2% among females. The
average recovery period of males was 18.89±7.75 days and females were 19±8.40
days from SARS-CoV-2. The overall mortality rate was 8.06%. The death rate of
male patients was significantly higher (P<0.05) compared to female patients.
Also, the mortality rate was higher (P<0.05) in male patients of 40-60 years of
age compared to female patients of the same age group. Moreover, the mortality
rate significantly increased (P<0.05) with the increase of age irrespective of
gender. In conclusion, the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 is higher in 
males compared to the female population. Moreover, irrespective of gender the
mortality rate was significantly lower among patients aged <40 years.
