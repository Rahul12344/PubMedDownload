BACKGROUND/AIM: A considerable number of patients with lung cancer are scheduled 
for definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy. Prevalence and potential risk factors of
pre-radiotherapy sleep disturbances were evaluated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen factors were retrospectively investigated for
associations with pre-radiotherapy sleep disturbances in 77 lung cancer patients.
Factors included COVID-19 pandemic; age; gender; performance score; comorbidity
index; history of another malignancy; distress score; number of emotional,
physical or practical problems; patient's request for psychological support;
histology; tumor stage; upfront surgery; chemotherapy; and type of radiotherapy.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (40.3%) reported sleep disturbances that were
significantly associated with distress score 6-10 (p=0.019), ≥2 emotional
problems (p=0.001), ≥5 physical problems (p<0.001), and request for psychological
support (p=0.006). Trends were found for female gender (p=0.064) and stereotactic
body radiation therapy (p=0.057).
CONCLUSION: Many lung cancer patients assigned to radiotherapy reported sleep
disturbances. Risk factors can be used to identify patients in need of
psychological support already before treatment.
