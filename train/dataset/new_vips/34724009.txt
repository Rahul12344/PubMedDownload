In this work, we designed and developed a method to detect S1 spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2. The portable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance instrument equipped 
with a two-channel system was combined with the biotin-streptavidin platform on a
nanogold surface to immobilize biotinylated aptamers. The proposed assay does not
utilize antibodies or enzyme-based reagents, further simplifying the detection
method. Using aptamer-protein bioaffinity interactions, the aptasensor
selectively and specifically detected in real-time S1 spike protein, rather than 
S2 spike protein, RBD spike protein, or bovine serum albumin. The dynamic range
and limit of detection of the aptasensor was determined to be 1 nM-100 nM and
0.26 nM, respectively. Notably, aptasensor detected preferentially S1 protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and detected S1 protein with >95% recovery in
artificial saliva, and serum albumin, excellent repeatability and shelf-life
stability. The method may provide a low-cost, rapid, and real-time detection and 
monitoring of viruses in the general public.
