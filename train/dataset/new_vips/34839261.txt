BACKGROUND: Despite clinical success with anti-spike vaccines, the effectiveness 
of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines has been compromised by rapidly spreading
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Viruses can hijack the glycosylation machinery of host cells
to shield themselves from the host's immune response and attenuate antibody
efficiency. However, it remains unclear if targeting glycosylation on viral spike
protein can impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
METHODS: We adopted flow cytometry, ELISA, and BioLayer interferometry approaches
to assess binding of glycosylated or deglycosylated spike with ACE2. Viral entry 
was determined by luciferase, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed a significant relationship between 
STT3A and COVID-19 severity. NF-κB/STT3A-regulated N-glycosylation was
investigated by gene knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter
assay. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that couples
non-neutralization anti-spike antibody with NGI-1 (4G10-ADC) to specifically
target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.
FINDINGS: The receptor binding domain and three distinct SARS-CoV-2 surface
N-glycosylation sites among 57,311 spike proteins retrieved from the
NCBI-Virus-database are highly evolutionarily conserved (99.67%) and are involved
in ACE2 interaction. STT3A is a key glycosyltransferase catalyzing spike
glycosylation and is positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. We found that 
inhibiting STT3A using N-linked glycosylation inhibitor-1 (NGI-1) impaired
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that of its variants [Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta
(B.1.351)]. Most importantly, 4G10-ADC enters SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and NGI-1
is subsequently released to deglycosylate spike protein, thereby reinforcing the 
neutralizing abilities of antibodies, vaccines, or convalescent sera and reducing
SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity.
INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that targeting evolutionarily-conserved
STT3A-mediated glycosylation via an ADC can exert profound impacts on SARS-CoV-2 
variant infectivity. Thus, we have identified a novel deglycosylation method
suitable for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 variant infection in vitro.
