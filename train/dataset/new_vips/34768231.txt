BACKGROUND: Rapid testing for COVID-19 has been clearly identified as an
essential component of the strategy to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,
worldwide. The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular 
biology test based on nicking and extension amplification reaction (NEAR).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when 
used as a point-of-care test (POCT) in our Emergency Department (ED).
TYPE OF STUDY: This prospective study enrolled 395 consecutive patients; paired
nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each study participant. The first swab
was tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay at the point-of-care by ED nurses. The 
second swab was diluted in viral transport medium (VTM) and sent to the clinical 
microbiology department for analysis by both the RT-PCR Simplexa test COVID-19
Direct assay as the study reference method, and the ID NOW COVID-19 assay
performed in the laboratory.
RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs directly tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay
yielded a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 98.0%, 97.5%, 96.2% and 98.7%,
respectively, in comparison with the RT-PCR study reference assay. When the ID
NOW COVID-19 assay was performed in the laboratory using the VTM samples, the
sensitivity decreased to 62.5% and the NPV to 79.7%. Three false negative test
results were reported with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when performed using
undiluted swabs directly in the ED; these results were obtained from patients
with elevated CT values (> 30).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the ID NOW COVID-19 assay, performed as a point 
of care test in the ED using dry swabs, provides a rapid and reliable alternative
to laboratory-based RT-PCR methods.
