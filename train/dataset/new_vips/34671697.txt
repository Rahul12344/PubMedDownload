In a viral pandemic, a few important tests are required for successful
containment of the virus and reduction in severity of the infection. Among those 
tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for
assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test
therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a
sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable,
background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate
coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target
cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles
would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody 
can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system
consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle
attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml
and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 {\mu}g/ml. This is to be compared 
to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.
