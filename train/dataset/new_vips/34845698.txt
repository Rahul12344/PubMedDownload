This method originated due to the need to quickly and sensitively detect Avocado 
sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) in nursery and field trees in California. Optimum
sampling protocols were developed for leaf collection from different sized trees 
based on size and branching as well as for fruit. An ethanol containing buffered 
extract from 1 g of ground leaf tissue was used as the source of RNA. The extract
was absorbed onto small pieces (disks) of Whatman No. 1 filter paper which were
then washed and dried. RNA was eluted from the filter paper using sterile water
and used as a template in a standard single-tube RT-PCR reaction. The RNA
adsorbed on the filter paper disks was quite stable, and the disks could be
stored for over 1 year and shipped worldwide at ambient temperature with no
noticeable decline in the quality or quantity of the resulting RT-PCR products.
The filter paper capture method was expanded to the detection of other viroids
including Potato spindle tuber viroid, Peach latent mosaic viroid, and
Chrysanthemum stunt viroid and was tested with some viruses as well with minor
modifications of the standard protocol.
