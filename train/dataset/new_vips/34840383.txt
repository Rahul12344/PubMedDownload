Background: Recently, people have recognized the post-acute phase symptoms of the
COVID-19. We investigated the long-term symptoms associated with COVID-19, (Long 
COVID Syndrome), and the risk factors associated with it.
Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. All the consecutive adult 
patients referred to the healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province from 19 
February 2020 until 20 November 2020 were included. All the patients had a
confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. In a phone call to the patients, at least three
months after their discharge from the hospital, we obtained their current
information. The IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0) was used. Pearson Chi square,
Fisher's exact test, t test, and binary logistic regression analysis model were
employed. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results: In total, 4,681 patients were studied, 2915 of whom (62.3%) reported
symptoms. The most common symptoms of long COVID syndrome were fatigue, exercise 
intolerance, walking intolerance, muscle pain, and shortness of breath. Women
were more likely to experience long-term COVID syndrome than men (Odds Ratio:
1,268; 95% Confidence Interval: 1,122-1,432; P=0.0001), which was significant.
Presentation with respiratory problems at the onset of illness was also
significantly associated with long COVID syndrome (Odds Ratio: 1.425; 95%
Confidence Interval: 1.177-1.724; P=0.0001). A shorter length of hospital stay
was inversely associated with long COVID syndrome (Odds Ratio: 0.953; 95%
Confidence Interval: 0.941-0.965; P=0.0001).
Conclusion: Long COVID syndrome is a frequent and disabling condition and has
significant associations with sex (female), respiratory symptoms at the onset,
and the severity of the illness.
