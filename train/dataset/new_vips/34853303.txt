The cell intrinsic antiviral response of multicellular organisms developed over
millions of years and critically relies on the ability to sense and eliminate
viral nucleic acids. Here we use an affinity proteomics approach in evolutionary 
distant species (human, mouse and fly) to identify proteins that are conserved in
their ability to associate with diverse viral nucleic acids. This approach shows 
a core of orthologous proteins targeting viral genetic material and
species-specific interactions. Functional characterization of the influence of
181 candidates on replication of 6 distinct viruses in human cells and flies
identifies 128 nucleic acid binding proteins with an impact on virus growth. We
identify the family of TAO kinases (TAOK1, -2 and -3) as dsRNA-interacting
antiviral proteins and show their requirement for type-I interferon induction.
Depletion of TAO kinases in mammals or flies leads to an impaired response to
virus infection characterized by a reduced induction of interferon stimulated
genes in mammals and impaired expression of srg1 and diedel in flies. Overall,
our study shows a larger set of proteins able to mediate the interaction between 
viral genetic material and host factors than anticipated so far, attesting to the
ancestral roots of innate immunity and to the lineage-specific pressures exerted 
by viruses.
