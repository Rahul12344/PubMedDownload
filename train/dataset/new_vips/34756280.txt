PURPOSE: To perform a retrospective analysis on patients with HLA-B27 negative
hypertensive acute anterior uveitis. Aqueous humor samples were obtained on which
a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was performed. The patients were then
classified into 3 groups depending on whether they were positive for
cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpesvirus (HSV-VZV) or negative for both.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different variables were collected in successive visits
(baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months). The variables were age, sex, visual acuity,
intraocular pressure (IOP), cells in the anterior chamber, retro-keratic
precipitates, hypotensive treatment, glaucoma or retina surgery, corneal
transplantation, and central thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer.
RESULTS: The sample was 36 patients, with a mean age of 59.78 ± 15.26 years. The 
mean baseline IOP value was 40 ± 10.42 mmHg in the CMV group compared to
23.8 ± 10.4 mmHg in the HSV-VZV, and 22.65 ± 9.9 mmHg in the negative group. The 
baseline frequency of retro-keratic precipitates, hypotensive treatment, glaucoma
surgery, and corneal transplantation was higher in CMV positives. At one year,
the loss of retinal nerve fiber layer and glaucoma surgery was greater in the
negative group. In the 3 groups, there was a direct and positive correlation
between IOP and inflammation in the anterior chamber. Being 0.94 (P = .05) for
the positive for CMV, 0.24 (P = .75) in that of HSV-VZV, and 0.98 (P = .17) in
the negative group.
CONCLUSIONS: HLA-B27 negative hypertensive acute anterior uveitis with CMV
positive has a more aggressive initial presentation. However, after one year, the
glaucomatous damage is less than in the negative group. In hypertensive acute
anterior uveitis, when inflammation in anterior chamber is controlled then IOP is
also controlled.
