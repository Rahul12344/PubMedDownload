BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because of the effect of vitamins on modulating the
immune system function, we have evaluated the effect of supplementation with
vitamins A, B, C, D, and E in ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: This study was a randomized and single-blinded clinical trial in which
60 subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group (n=30)
received vitamins, and the control group did not receive any vitamin or placebo. 
The intervention was included 25,000 IU daily of vitamins A, 600,000 IU once
during the study of D, 300 IU twice daily of E, 500 mg four times daily of C, and
one amp daily of B complex for 7 days. At baseline and after the 7-day
intervention, the serum levels of inflammatory markers, vitamins, and the SOFA
score were assessed. In addition, the mortality rate and duration of
hospitalization were evaluated after the intervention (IRCT registration number: 
IRCT20200319046819N1/registration date: 2020-04-04,
https://www.irct.ir/trial/46838 ).
RESULTS: Significant changes were detected in serum levels of vitamins (p < 0.001
for all vitamins), ESR (p < 0.001), CRP (p = 0.001), IL6 (p = 0.003), TNF-a (p = 
0.001), and SOFA score (p < 0.001) after intervention compared with the control
group. The effect of vitamins on the mortality rate was not statistically
significant (p=0.112). The prolonged hospitalization rate to more than 7 days was
significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (p=0.001).
Regarding the effect size, there was a significant and inverse association
between receiving the intervention and prolonged hospitalization (OR = 0.135, 95%
CI 0.038-0.481; p=0.002); however, after adjusting for confounders, it was not
significant (OR=0.402, 95% CI 0.086-1.883; p=0.247).
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with vitamins A, B, C, D, and E could improve the
inflammatory response and decrease the severity of disease in ICU-admitted
patients with COVID-19.
