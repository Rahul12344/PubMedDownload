Astroviruses (AstVs) are among the most important viruses causing diarrhea in
human infants and many animals, posing a threat to public health safety and a
burden on the economy. Five porcine AstV (PAstV) genotypes have been identified
in various countries, including China. However, the epidemiology of PAstV in
Yunnan province, China, remains unknown. In this study, 489 fecal samples from
pigs in all 16 prefectures/cities of Yunnan were collected between April and
August of 2020 for epidemiological investigation. The total infection rate of
PAstV-2 or PAstV-5 was 39.9%, with suckling piglets having the highest infection 
rate (62.3%). The ORF2 genes of seven PAstV-2 and 10 PAstV-5 isolates were
sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. In addition to coinfections with PAstV-2
and PAstV-5, coinfections of PAstV with other diarrhea-inducing viruses (e.g.,
porcine bocavirus) were also discovered. A comparison of ORF2-encoded capsid
protein sequences revealed that there were multiple insertions and deletions in
the seven Yunnan PAstV-2 sequences, while point mutations, but no deletions or
insertions, were found in the 10 Yunnan PAstV-5 sequences, which were very
similar to the reference sequences. This is the first epidemiological
investigation and genetic characterization of PAstV-2 and PAstV-5 in Yunnan
province, China, demonstrating the current PAstV infection situation in Yunnan.
