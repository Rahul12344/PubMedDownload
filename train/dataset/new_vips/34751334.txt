COVID-19 infection causes a systemic inflammatory response, which mainly presents
as a febrile syndrome with respiratory involvement. We report a 37-year-old male 
who consulted for myalgia, nausea and epigastric pain lasting three days. On
admission, he had crepitations at the lung bases. The initial laboratory showed a
creatine kinase of 62,768 U/L, a LDH of 1,110 IU/L, a creatinine a 2.1 mg/dL, an 
aspartate aminotransferase of 1,347 IU/L, a D-dimer of 1,140 ng/mL, a ferritin of
1,201 ng/mL and a lymphocyte count of 810 cells/mm3. The chest CT scan was
compatible with multifocal pneumonia, suggesting a COVID-19 infection. COVID-19
PCR was positive. The patient was managed with hydration, sodium bicarbonate,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, with a good clinical response.
