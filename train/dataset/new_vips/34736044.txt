PURPOSE: There are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in children
with cancer or after haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We describe the 
severity and outcomes of SARS-COV-2 in these patients and identify factors
associated with severe disease.
METHODS: This was a multinational, observational study of children (aged <19
years) with cancer or HSCT and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.
COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical (≥1
organ support). Exact polytomous regression was used to determine the
relationship between clinical variables and disease severity.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients with COVID-19 across 10 countries
were identified (median age 8 years). Seventy-eight (60%) had leukaemia/lymphoma,
48 (37%) had solid tumour and five had primary immunodeficiency and HSCT. Fever
(71%), cough (47%) and coryza (29%) were the most frequent symptoms. The median
duration of detectable virus was 16 days (range, 1-79 days). Forty-nine patients 
(37%) were hospitalised for COVID-19 symptoms, and 15 (11%) required intensive
care unit-level care. Chemotherapy was delayed/modified in 35% of patients.
COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 32% of patients, mild in 47%, moderate in 8%, severe
in 4% and critical in 9%. In 124 patients (95%), a full recovery was documented, 
and four (3%) died due to COVID-19. Any comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.94; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.81-5.21), any coinfection (1.74; 95% CI 1.03-3.03)
and severe baseline neutropenia (1.82; 95% CI 1.13-3.09) were independently and
significantly associated with increasing disease severity.
CONCLUSION: Although most children with cancer had asymptomatic/mild disease, 13%
had severe COVID-19 and 3% died. Comorbidity, coinfection and neutropenia may
increase the risk of severe disease. Our data may help management decisions in
this vulnerable population.
