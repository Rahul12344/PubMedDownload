BACKGROUND: Without high-quality nutritional support, there is a risk that people
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will replace lost muscle mass
with fat mass when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). We have shown that
lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) with whey or soy considerably increases
lean mass among Ethiopian people with HIV starting ART. Here, we aim to assess
the effects of LNS on insulin function and glucose metabolism.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial testing the effect of
three-month supplementation with LNS containing whey (LNS/whey) or soy (LNS/soy) 
among people with HIV. LNS/whey and LNS/soy groups were combined and then were
compared against the non-supplemented group. The outcomes were change in fasting 
plasma-glucose (FPG), and 30-min glucose and 120-min glucose after oral glucose
tolerance test. We further assessed effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),
fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment index for beta-cell function
(HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
RESULTS: Of the 318 patients enrolled, 268 (84.3%) had available FPG and HbA1c
and included. After 3 months of ART, HbA1c tended to be 2 mmol/mol higher in the 
LNS supplemented group, most pronounced among those receiving whey as the protein
source. LNS led to higher 30-min glucose (0.5 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8) and
120-min glucose (0.4 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03, 0.8) and a > 50% increase in fasting
insulin, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR compared to the non-supplemented.
CONCLUSION: Among Ethiopian people with HIV initiating ART, short-term LNS intake
increased glucose and insulin levels, and tended to increase HbA1c, potentially
leading to more insulin resistance. Higher intake of carbohydrates with LNS could
influence glycemic status. Whether these metabolic changes in early HIV treatment
are beneficial or increase long-term risk of metabolic disorders needs to be
explored.
