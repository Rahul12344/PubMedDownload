In contrast to the conventional approach of directly comparing genomic sequences 
using sequence alignment tools, we propose a computational approach that performs
comparisons between sequence generators. These sequence generators are learned
via a data-driven approach that empirically computes the state machine generating
the genomic sequence of interest. As the state machine based generator of the
sequence is independent of the sequence length, it provides us with an efficient 
method to compute the statistical distance between large sets of genomic
sequences. Moreover, our technique provides a fast and efficient method to
cluster large datasets of genomic sequences, characterize their temporal and
spatial evolution in a continuous manner, get insights into the locality
sensitive information about the sequences without any need for alignment.
Furthermore, we show that the technique can be used to detect local regions with 
mutation activity, which can then be applied to aid alignment techniques for the 
fast discovery of mutations. To demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on real
genomic data, we cluster different strains of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences,
characterize their evolution and identify regions of the viral sequence with
mutations.
