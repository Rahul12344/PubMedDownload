A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was established for the rapid 
detection of Decapod iridescent virus 1 using primers targeted to the virus's
ATPase gene (ORF114R). Optimization experiments showed that the optimal
amplification temperature of the RPA assay was 37 °C and that the reaction could 
be completed within only 15 min. The target band of 15 min. is bright enough. In 
order to shorten the operational reaction time, consequently, 15 min was the
optimal amplification time for our new RPA assay for DIV1. Specificity tests
showed that the RPA assay did not exhibit any cross-reactivity with other shrimp 
pathogens(TSV, MrNV, YHV-1, WSSV, EHP, AHPND, EHNV, RSIV, RGV and IHHNV).
Sensitivity tests further showed that the detection limit of the new RPA assay
was 200 copies/50 μL, indicating that this assay was more sensitive than a nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. A total of 509 clinical samples were
assayed using the RPA and the PCR assays; analysis showed that the RPA method
could detect weak-positive samples more effectively than the PCR method.
Collectively, these findings indicated that the RPA assay was fast, simple,
specific, sensitive and has significant potentials for clinical and on-site
testing.
