BACKGROUND: In addition to having a negative impact on the physical and emotional
health of the population, the global Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated
psychotherapists moving their practice to online environments. This service
evaluation examines the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR) Therapy delivered via the internet.
METHODS: A real-world service evaluation was conducted from a self-selecting
group of EMDR therapists that subscribe to either a JISCMail discussion list or
either the UK or All Ireland National EMDR Associations. Author designed
questionnaires were used to gather information on the efficacy of EMDR delivered 
online as well as client and therapist characteristics.
RESULTS: Thirty-three therapists provided efficacy data on a total of 93
patients. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions were
found in all four-psychometrics used both in adult and children and young people 
populations. Client outcome was not related to therapist experience.
CONCLUSIONS: EMDR delivered via the internet can be an effective treatment for
clients experiencing mental health issues.
