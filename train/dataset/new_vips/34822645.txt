Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), considered one of the most globally important
porcine pathogens, causes postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). This
virus is localized in the mitochondria in pigs with PMWS. Here, we identified,
for the first time, a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) in the PCV2 capsid 
protein (Cap) at the N-terminus. PK-15 cells showed colocalization of the
MLS-EGFP fusion protein with mitochondria. Since the PCV2 Cap also contained a
nuclear localization signal (NLS) that mediated entry into the nucleus, we
inferred that the subcellular localization of the PCV2 Cap is inherently complex 
and dependent on the viral life cycle. Furthermore, we also determined that
deletion of the MLS attenuated Cap-induced apoptosis. More importantly, the MLS
was essential for PCV2 replication, as absence of the MLS resulted in failure of 
virus rescue from cells infected with infectious clone DNA. In conclusion, the
MLS of the PCV2 Cap plays critical roles in Cap-induced apoptosis, and MLS
deletion of Cap is lethal for virus rescue.
