BACKGROUND: To examine whether outdoor transmission may contribute to the
COVID-19 epidemic, we hypothesized that slower outdoor wind speed is associated
with increased risk of transmission when individuals socialize outside.
METHODS: Daily COVID-19 incidence reported in Suffolk County, NY, between March
16th and December 31st, 2020, was the outcome. Average wind speed and maximal
daily temperature were collated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence rates
while adjusting for susceptible population size.
RESULTS: Cases were very high in the initial wave but diminished once lockdown
procedures were enacted. Most days between May 1st, 2020, and October 24th, 2020,
had temperatures 16-28 °C and wind speed diminished slowly over the year and
began to increase again in December 2020. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted
analyses revealed that days with temperatures ranging between 16 and 28 °C where 
wind speed was < 8.85 km per hour (KPH) had increased COVID-19 incidence
(aIRR = 1.45, 95% C.I. = [1.28-1.64], P < 0.001) as compared to days with average
wind speed ≥ 8.85 KPH.
CONCLUSION: Throughout the U.S. epidemic, the role of outdoor shared spaces such 
as parks and beaches has been a topic of considerable interest. This study
suggests that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may occur by noting that the risk 
of transmission of COVID-19 in the summer was higher on days with low wind speed.
Outdoor use of increased physical distance between individuals, improved air
circulation, and use of masks may be helpful in some outdoor environments where
airflow is limited.
