BACKGROUND: COVID-19 hospitalizations of non-institutionalized persons during the
first COVID-19 wave in Connecticut disproportionately affected the elderly,
communities of color, and individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES). Whether 
the magnitude of these disparities changed after the initial lockdown and before 
vaccine rollout is not well documented.
METHODS: All first-time hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
during July to December 2020, including patients' geocoded residential addresses,
were obtained from the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Those living in
congregate settings, including nursing homes, were excluded. Community-dwelling
patients were assigned census tract-level poverty and crowding measures from the 
2014-2018 American Community Survey by linking their geocoded addresses to census
tracts. Age-adjusted incidence and relative rates were calculated across
demographic and SES measures and compared with those from a similar analysis of
hospitalized cases during the initial wave.
RESULTS: During July to December 2020, there were 5652 COVID-19 hospitalizations 
in community residents in Connecticut. Incidence was highest among those
>85 years, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx compared with non-Hispanic
Whites {relative rate (RR) 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.83-3.32) and 5.9
(95% CI 5.58-6.28)}, and persons living in high poverty and high crowding census 
tracts. Although racial/ethnic and SES disparities during the study period were
substantial, they were significantly decreased compared with the first wave of
COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of persistent, if reduced, large racial/ethnic
disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations 2-7 months after the initial lockdown
was relaxed and before vaccination was widely available is of concern. These
disparities cause a challenge to achieving health equity and are relevant for
future pandemic planning.
