BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of human society,
including education, culture, and the economy, and has also introduced changes in
people's health behaviors such as drinking alcohol, nutrition intake, and
practicing healthy living. This study conducted qualitative research in the
Korean context to examine the changes in the smoking behavior of smokers and
secondhand smoke exposure of non-smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted with 36 Korean participants (18
men and 18 women). The groups were composed of cigarette smokers, e-cigarette
users, heated tobacco product users, and non-smokers.
RESULTS: During the pandemic, it was found that there was an increase in the
frequency of use, irrespective of the tobacco product, in users who refrained
from social interaction and worked or studied from home. Users who continued to
be socially active increased the amount used with each usage. Smokers showed a
tendency to avoid smoking rooms and to smoke alone in places unoccupied by
people. In addition, non-smokers' exposure to secondhand smoke did not decrease, 
but since non-smokers used masks, they reported more relief from the risk of
exposure to secondhand smoke than before.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite smokers being a high-risk group for COVID-19, the risk did
not result in smoking cessation among smokers. Therefore, policies and
educational campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and to
encourage smoking cessation are needed in the future.
