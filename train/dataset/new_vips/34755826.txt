OBJECTIVE: To analyze the factors associated with mental distress among health
workers who cared for patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study of national scope, carried out
between in the second quarter of 2020. A total of 437 health professionals, who
filled out an electronic form about sociodemographic data, occupational aspects, 
psychosocial characteristics of work and mental distress. Multiple logistic
regression was performed to analyze the covariables associated with mental
distress.
RESULTS: There was a predominance of workers on the nursing team (65.0%), female 
(71.0%), from Southeastern region of the country (68.6%) and with no morbidities 
(36.2%). The prevalence of mental distress was 61.6%. Job strain was reported by 
24% of participants, and the perception of low support from coworkers was
described by 52.9%. The final multiple regression model showed that mental
distress was associated with females (odds ratio - OR: 1.93; 95%CI: 1.22-3.07),
age up to 40 years (OR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.07-2.52), weekly working hours equal or
over 60 hours (OR: 1.87; 95%CI: 1.15-3.11), job strain (OR: 2.45; 95%CI:
1.41-4.40) and low support from co-workers (OR: 3.47; 95%CI: 2.26-5.38).
CONCLUSION: Six out of ten participants presented mental distress, which was
associated to both individual characteristics and factors related to the work
carried out during the pandemic. There is an urgent need to map services that
have such characteristics, to outline actions to promote mental health and
prevent emotional distress at different levels of health care.
