Our understanding of the composition and functions of splenic stromal cells
remains incomplete. Here, based on analysis of over 20,000 single cell
transcriptomes of splenic fibroblasts, we characterized the phenotypic and
functional heterogeneity of these cells in healthy state and during virus
infection. We describe eleven transcriptionally distinct fibroblastic cell
clusters, reassuring known subsets and revealing yet unascertained heterogeneity 
amongst fibroblasts occupying diverse splenic niches. We further identify
striking differences in innate immune signatures of distinct stromal compartments
in vivo. Compared to other fibroblasts and to endothelial cells, Ly6C+
fibroblasts of the red pulp were selectively endowed with enhanced
interferon-stimulated gene expression in homeostasis, upon systemic interferon
stimulation and during virus infection in vivo. Collectively, we provide an
updated map of fibroblastic cell diversity in the spleen that suggests a
specialized innate immune function for splenic red pulp fibroblasts.
