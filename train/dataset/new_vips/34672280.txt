The last nine months have been not short of challenging, overwhelming,
heart-acheing individual and collective experiences which have and probably will 
continue to shape our ways of living for generations to come. This paper aims to 
provide a space in which to reflect and revisit our understanding of well-being
and its implementation in light of these past few months and the continuous
obstacles faced. It endeavours to offer some thoughts on how this unique time
could be experienced to our advantage, and even in light of extreme pressure,
stresses, and losses, how this opportunity for reflection can advise and guide
our thinking and behaviours, values and beliefs, to new hopes and discovery that 
will hopefully provide some level of solace, inner strength and transformative
growth. Through selected five pillars of well-being all discussed in turns, it
aims to challenge and present alternative understanding and application of these 
pillars, that can hopefully continue to develop and grow as we are all exposed to
new lived experiences. It concludes by inviting other colleagues and individuals 
in their own quest for making-sense and meaning-making of these challenging
times.
