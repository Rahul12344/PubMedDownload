Importance: Although several studies have provided information on short-term
clinical outcomes in children with perinatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2, data on the 
immune response in the first months of life among newborns exposed to the virus
in utero are lacking.
Objective: To characterize systemic and mucosal antibody production during the
first 2 months of life among infants who were born to mothers infected with
SARS-CoV-2.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study enrolled 28
pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and who gave birth at
Policlinico Umberto I in Rome, Italy, from November 2020 to May 2021, and their
newborns. Maternal and neonatal systemic immune responses were investigated by
detecting spike-specific antibodies in serum, and the mucosal immune response was
assessed by measuring specific antibodies in maternal breastmilk and infant
saliva 48 hours after delivery and 2 months later.
Exposures: Maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The systemic immune response was evaluated by the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies and receptor binding
domain-specific IgM antibodies in maternal and neonatal serum. The mucosal immune
response was assessed by measuring spike-specific antibodies in breastmilk and in
infant saliva, and the presence of antigen-antibody spike IgA immune complexes
was investigated in breastmilk samples. All antibodies were detected using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: In total, 28 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 31.8 [6.4]
years; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.1 [2.3] weeks; 18 [60%] male infants) were
enrolled at delivery, and 21 dyads completed the study at 2 months' follow-up.
Because maternal infection was recent in all cases, transplacental transfer of
virus spike-specific IgG antibodies occurred in only 1 infant. One case of
potential vertical transmission and 1 case of horizontal infection were observed.
Virus spike protein-specific salivary IgA antibodies were significantly increased
(P = .01) in infants fed breastmilk (0.99 arbitrary units [AU]; IQR, 0.39-1.68
AU) vs infants fed an exclusive formula diet (0.16 AU; IQR, 0.02-0.83 AU).
Maternal milk contained IgA spike immune complexes at 48 hours (0.53 AU; IQR,
0.25-0.39 AU) and at 2 months (0.09 AU; IQR, 0.03-0.17 AU) and may have
functioned as specific stimuli for the infant mucosal immune response.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA
antibodies were detected in infant saliva, which may partly explain why newborns 
are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mothers infected in the peripartum period 
appear to not only passively protect the newborn via breastmilk secretory IgA but
also actively stimulate and train the neonatal immune system via breastmilk
immune complexes.
