BACKGROUND: Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus haemorrhagic disease (EEHV HD) 
is the leading cause of death in captive Asian elephant calves in Asia, North
America, and Europe with a mortality rate of ~ 65% in calves that are under human
care. Although EEHV HD was first found in elephant camps, more recently it was
identified in wild populations which poses a greater threat to the elephant
population. Deaths due to EEHV HD have been seen in wild elephants, but the
in-situ prevalence and mortality rate is unknown. We report the first EEHV HD
cases in Malaysia from 3 wild born endangered Bornean elephant calves from Sabah 
with known typical clinical signs.
CASE PRESENTATION: The first calf died within 24 h of the onset of clinical
signs; the second calf died within 12 h of the onset of clinical signs. The third
calf succumbed within 72 h. Necropsies revealed that all 3 calves had similar
presentations of EEHV HD but in the third calf with less severity. We conducted
conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) assays and found EEHV DNA at all 7 
loci in the 3 calves; it was identified as EEHV1A, the virus type that has been
found in most other reported cases.
CONCLUSION: Typical EEHV HD clinical signs and the molecular confirmation of EEHV
by cPCR and sequencing point to EEHV as the cause of death. Further genetic
investigation of the strain is in progress.
