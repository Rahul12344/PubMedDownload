OBJECTIVE: to map the scientific production on interprofessional relationships in

of Science, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases, covering the period of
publication in 2020, using the acronym PCC (Population = health professionals;
Concept = interprofessional relationships; Context = health services) and
respective search strategies.
RESULTS: fourteen scientific articles were selected and the content discussed in 
the manuscripts was standardized, analyzed and organized into categories of
affinities and similarities of their results: 1 - Interprofessional
collaboration; 2 - Collaborative practice; 3 - Interprofessional work; 4 -
Interactive and interprofessional learning.
CONCLUSION: the pandemic demanded quick and effective responses that were only
possible through collaboration and interprofessionalism dimensions.
