To advance a novel concept of debulking virus in the oral cavity, the primary
site of viral replication, virus-trapping proteins CTB-ACE2 were expressed in
chloroplasts and clinical-grade plant material was developed to meet FDA
requirements. Chewing gum (2 g) containing plant cells expressed CTB-ACE2 up to
17.2 mg ACE2/g dry weight (11.7% leaf protein), have physical characteristics and
taste/flavor like conventional gums, and no protein was lost during gum
compression. CTB-ACE2 gum efficiently (>95%) inhibited entry of lentivirus spike 
or VSV-spike pseudovirus into Vero/CHO cells when quantified by luciferase or red
fluorescence. Incubation of CTB-ACE2 microparticles reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus
count in COVID-19 swab/saliva samples by >95% when evaluated by
microbubbles (femtomolar concentration) or qPCR, demonstrating both virus
trapping and blocking of cellular entry. COVID-19 saliva samples showed low or
undetectable ACE2 activity when compared with healthy individuals (2,582 versus
50,126 ΔRFU; 27 versus 225 enzyme units), confirming greater susceptibility of
infected patients for viral entry. CTB-ACE2 activity was completely inhibited by 
pre-incubation with SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, offering an explanation
for reduced saliva ACE2 activity among COVID-19 patients. Chewing gum with
virus-trapping proteins offers a general affordable strategy to protect patients 
from most oral virus re-infections through debulking or minimizing transmission
to others.
