Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
is a crucial step in ending the current worldwide pandemic. However, several
particularly vulnerable groups in the population were not included in sufficient 
numbers in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine trials. Therefore, as
science advances, the advice for vaccinating these special populations against
Covid-19 will continue to evolve. This focused review provides the latest
recommendations and considerations for these special populations (i.e., patients 
with rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders, cancer, transplant recipients,
chronic liver diseases, end-stage renal disease, neurologic disorders,
psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular diseases,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, human immunodeficiency virus, current
smokers, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, children, and patients
with allergic reactions) using the currently available research evidence.
