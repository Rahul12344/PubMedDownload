Optoplasmonic bio-detection assays commonly probe the response of plasmonic
nanostructures to changes in their dielectric environment. The accurate detection
of nanoscale entities such as virus particles, micelles and proteins requires
optimization of multiple experimental parameters. Performing such optimization
directly via analyte recognition is often not desirable or feasible, especially
if the nanostructures exhibit limited numbers of analyte binding sites and if
binding is irreversible. Here we introduce photothermal spectro-microscopy as a
benchmarking tool for the characterization and optimization of optoplasmonic
detection assays.
