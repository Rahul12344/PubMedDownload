We conducted a survey exploring the experiences of NHS hospital acute medicine
services in England during the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were 
collected from 26th May to 8th July 2020. The results of 91 sites are presented. 
The total number of patients referred to the medical take for assessment and
admitted from the medical take decreased from pre-pandemic levels compared to
peak COVID-19 activity. The total number of acute medical beds decreased, however
critical care beds increased by 162%. We report the median timeline from first
admission of COVID-19 to when baseline critical care capacity was reached. We
found regional variation across the results. These findings can assist healthcare
leaders prepare for future pandemics.
