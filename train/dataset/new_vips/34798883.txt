BACKGROUND: After implementing a nationwide harm reduction program in 2006, a
dramatic decline in the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
among people with injection drug use (IDU) was observed in Taiwan. The harm
reduction program might have sent out the message discouraging the choice of IDU 
among illicit drug users in early stage. Based on the yearly first-time offense
rates from 2001 to 2017, this study aimed to examine (1) whether the nationwide
implementation of the harm reduction program in 2006 led to changes in first-time
offenders' use of heroin; (2) whether the intervention had a similar effect on
the use of other illicit drugs; and (3) whether the effect of the intervention
was limited to the first-time offenders of young age groups.
METHODS: Yearly first-time illicit-drug offense rates from 2001 to 2017 in Taiwan
were derived from two national databases for drug arrests that were verified
using urine tests: the Criminal Record Processing System on Schedule I/II Drugs
and the Administrative Penalty System for Schedule III/IV Substances. A hierarchy
of mutually exclusive categories of drug uses was defined by the drug with the
highest schedule level among those tested positive in an arrest. Segmented
regression analyses of interrupted time series were used to test for the impact
of the 2006 intervention.
RESULTS: There was a decrease of 22.37 per 100,000 in the rate for heroin but no 
detectable level changes in that for methamphetamine or ecstasy after the 2006
intervention in Taiwan. There were baseline decreasing trends in the first-time
offense rate from 2001 to 2017 for heroin and ecstasy and an increasing trend for
methamphetamine, with the slopes not altered by the 2006 intervention. The
postintervention decrease in the first-time offense rate for heroin was
detectable among offenders less than 40 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a diffusion effect of the 2006 intervention on 
decreasing heroin use among young offenders and have policy implications for
better prevention and treatment for different age groups.
