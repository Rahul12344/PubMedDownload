OBJECTIVE: The proportion of COVID-19 patients having active pulmonary
tuberculosis, and its impact on COVID-19 related patient outcomes, is not clear. 
We conducted this systematic review to evaluate the proportion of patients with
active pulmonary tuberculosis among COVID-19 patients, and to assess if comorbid 
pulmonary tuberculosis worsens clinical outcomes in these patients.
METHODS: We queried the PubMed and Embase databases for studies providing data on
(a) proportion of COVID-19 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis or (b)
severe disease, hospitalization, or mortality among COVID-19 patients with and
without active pulmonary tuberculosis. We calculated the proportion of
tuberculosis patients, and the relative risk (RR) for each reported outcome of
interest. We used random-effects models to summarize our data.
RESULTS: We retrieved 3,375 citations, and included 43 studies, in our review.
The pooled estimate for proportion of active pulmonary tuberculosis was 1.07%
(95% CI 0.81%-1.36%). COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis had a higher risk of
mortality (summary RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.56-2.39, from 17 studies) and for severe
COVID-19 disease (summary RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.02, from 20 studies), but not
for hospitalization (summary RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.91-3.81, from four studies), as
compared to COVID-19 patients without tuberculosis.
CONCLUSION: Active pulmonary tuberculosis is relatively common among COVID-19
patients and increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-related
mortality.
