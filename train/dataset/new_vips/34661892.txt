Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic
coronavirus that circulates in dromedary camels and sporadically transmit into
humans, subsequently resulting in community and nosocomial cases. The viral
infection in humans has a range of disease severity from asymptomatic to severe
pneumonia and death, whereas the infection in camels is usually asymptomatic.
There is no approved antiviral therapy or vaccine for MERS-CoV infections
although there have been a number of therapeutic and vaccine candidates under
development, for both humans and camels. To date, there has been limited research
on the immune responses and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in both humans and camels.
Here, this chapter is focused on MERS-CoV specific immunity in different species 
with some details regarding the various animal models.
