AAV vectors are being used extensively for gene-modifying therapies for
neurological disorders. Here, we report the surprising discovery that injections 
of different AAVs into the brain, spinal cord, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lead 
to robust transduction of cells in the pineal gland. We document transduction of 
cells in the pineal gland following focal injections of AAV2/9-shPTEN-zsGreen
into the sensorimotor or hippocampus of rats and injections of AAV2/Cre into the 
spinal cord of transgenic mice with a stop-flox tdT reporter. Pineal transduction
was evident even when AAV2/Cre injections were made into the lumbar spinal cord
many millimeters distant from the pineal gland. Immunostaining with antibodies
for cell types in the pineal gland revealed that pinealocytes were transduced.
Pineal transduction was also observed with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
injections of AAV2/9-shPTEN-zsGreen, suggesting that pineal transduction
following focal injections of AAV into CNS parenchyma may be caused by diffusion 
of the vector from the injection sites into the CSF and then accumulation in the 
pineal gland. Together, these findings suggest the need for vigilance for
functional consequences and possible adverse effects of off-target accumulation
of therapeutic AAVs in the pineal gland and AAV-driven expression of therapeutic 
cargos in pinealocytes.
