The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant impacts for nearly all industrial
and societal sectors in the world. As closures and social distancing mandates
were implemented to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus designated
as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the food
industry was immensely affected. This review explores the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on the food supply chain from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint and
provides perspectives on the consequences on food safety and food security, a
risk assessment on human-animal interactions, and considers logistical/protocol
adjustments required for the food industry. While foodborne transmission of the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is not a significant factor for food safety as
direct transmission of the virus through food products is not evident, food
security has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic
threatens food accessibility, especially for vulnerable populations of people,
through its effects on food cost and infrastructure, food distribution and public
transit access, and social inequities. Currently, global interest for COVID-19 is
focused on human health and rightfully so, but adverse effects on the food supply
chain are already evident and will likely continue to occur for several years
after the pandemic is over, let alone if other global health pandemics of this
magnitude surface in upcoming years. Uncertainties over the novel coronavirus
have interrupted global trade and supply chains. The pandemic has underlined the 
importance of a robust and resilient food system, which presents an unprecedented
challenge for competent authorities in upcoming years.
