INTRODUCTION: Antiseptic mouthwash is widely recommended to treat various oral
diseases as well as to improve oral health. Most of the dental procedures lead to
the generation of aerosols. These aerosols have a high potential to transmit
disease. Preprocedural oral rinse with antimicrobial agents in the form of
mouthwashes reduces the bacterial and viral load many folds. The purpose of this 
review was to summarize the effectiveness of mouthwash against viruses affecting 
human beings.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Search engines like PubMed, Google Scholar, and others were
used to search the electronic database. Articles were identified in which the
effectiveness of antiseptic mouth rinse against the virus was tested. A
comprehensive search strategy was designed to select the articles and then
independently screened for eligibility.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 9624 articles out of the 13 titles met the
eligibility criteria. The selected papers were included in the present manuscript
according to their relevance to the topic. Authors searched the most used
chemicals as mouthwashes but records of three types of mouthwash tested against
various types of viruses i.e. chlorhexidine gluconate, Povidone-iodine and
essential oil containing mouthwash (Listerine) were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Povidone-iodine mouth rinse is effective in reducing viral load
either in-vitro or in-vivo conditions. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash and
essential oils have shown its effectiveness in a few studies. Insufficient
evidence is available to support the claim that oral antiseptics can reduce the
risk of developing viral loads in humans or the rate of progression of diseases
caused by viruses.
