Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading viral cause of pediatric
respiratory infections and early infant mortality. Despite extensive development 
efforts currently underway, there remain no vaccines available for the prevention
of RSV. RSV is an enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus that utilizes two
different proteins (G and F) to mediate attachment and entry into host cells.
These G and F proteins are the primary determinants of viral strain-specific
differences and elicit protective neutralizing antibodies during natural
infection in humans. Earlier studies have demonstrated that these proteins play
an additional role in regulating the stability of RSV particles in response to
temperature and pH. However, it remains unclear how much variability exists in
the stability of RSV strains and what contribution changes in temperature and pH 
make to the clearance of virus during an active infection. In this study, we
evaluated the impacts of changes in temperature and pH on the inactivation of
four different chimeric recombinant RSV strains that differ exclusively in G and 
F protein expression. Using these data, we developed predictive mathematical
models to examine the specific contributions and variations in susceptibility
that exist between viral strains. Our data provide strain-specific clearance
rates and temperature-pH landscapes that shed light on the optimal contributions 
of temperature and pH to viral clearance. These provide new insight into how much
variation exists in the clearance of a major respiratory pathogen and may offer
new guidance on optimization of viral strains for development of live-attenuated 
vaccine preparations.
