Objectives: To describe lessons learned during the first COVID-19 outbreak in
developing urgent interventions to strengthen healthcare workers' capacity to
cope with acute stress caused by health care pressure, concern about becoming
infected, despair of witnessing patients' suffering, and critical decision-making
requirements of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during the first outbreak in Spain.
Methods: A task force integrated by healthcare professionals and academics was
activated following the first observations of acute stress reactions starting to 
compromise the professionals' capacity for caring COVID-19 patients. Literature
review and qualitative approach (consensus techniques) were applied. The target
population included health professionals in primary care, hospitals, emergencies,
and nursing homes. Interventions designed for addressing acute stress were agreed
and disseminated. Findings: There are similarities in stressors to previous
outbreaks, and the solutions devised then may work now. A set of issues,
interventions to cope with, and their levels of evidence were defined. Issues and
interventions were classified as: adequate communication initiative to strengthen
work morale (avoiding information blackouts, uniformity of criteria, access to
updated information, mentoring new professionals); resilience and recovery from
physical and mental fatigue (briefings, protecting the family, regulated recovery
time during the day, psychological first aid, humanizing care); reinforce
leadership of intermediate commands (informative leadership, transparency,
realism, and positive messages, the current state of emergency has not allowed
for an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of proposed interventions. Sharing
information to gauge expectations, listening to what professionals need, feeling 
protected from threats, organizational flexibility, encouraging teamwork, and
leadership that promotes psychological safety have led to more positive
responses. Attention to the needs of individuals must be combined with caring for
the teams responsible for patient care. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19
pandemic has a more devastating effect than other recent outbreaks, there are
common stressors and lessons learned in all of them that we must draw on to
increase our capacity to respond to future healthcare crises.
