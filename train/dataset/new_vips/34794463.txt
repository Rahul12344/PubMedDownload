BACKGROUND: B-cell proliferative disorders, such as post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), are increased among persons afflicted by
T-cell compromise. Most are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) + and can first present with
a focal lesion. Direct introduction of oncolytic viruses into localized tumors
provides theoretical advantages over chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation
therapy by reducing systemic toxicity. Despite extensive study as a vehicle for
gene therapy, adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have rarely been applied to human
cancer research due to technical and theoretical obstacles. Moreover, human
B-cells have historically been described as resistant to AAV infection.
Nonetheless, advances using different recombinant (r)AAV serotypes with unique
tropisms to deliver cytotoxic therapy suggested a localized anti-tumor approach
was feasible.
METHODS: As a prelude to the development of a therapeutic vehicle, the ability of
fifteen distinct EGFP-bearing rAAV serotypes to transduce human B-cells,
including primary, immortalized, and B-cell tumor lines ± EBV was assessed by
confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and subsequently cell viability assay.
RESULTS: Rank order analysis revealed augmented transduction by rAAV6.2 and
closely related virions. EBV infection of EBV-negative B-cell tumor lines and EBV
immortalization of primary B-cells increased susceptibility to rAAV6.2
transduction. As a proof of concept, transduction by rAAV6.2 encoding herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV1)-thymidine kinase (TK) eliminated TK-negative
rhabdomyosarcoma cells and diminished viability of transduced B-cell lines upon
incubation with ganciclovir.
CONCLUSIONS: rAAV serotypes differentially transduce human B-cell lines reversing
the dogma that human B-cells are refractory to AAV infection. EBV + B-cells
display increased susceptibility to rAAV6.2 infection, uncovering a new method
for improved nucleic acid transfer into transfection-resistant B-cell lines. The 
introduction of a functional suicide gene into the rAAV6.2 genome identifies a
candidate vector for the development of rAAV-based oncolytic therapy targeting
focal EBV-bearing B-lymphoproliferative disorders.
