Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a unique worldwide pandemic. With new mutations
of the virus with higher transmission rates, it is imperative to diagnose
positive cases as quickly and accurately as possible. Therefore, a fast,
accurate, and automatic system for COVID-19 diagnosis can be very useful for
clinicians. In this study, seven machine learning and four deep learning models
were presented to diagnose positive cases of COVID-19 from three routine
laboratory blood tests datasets. Three correlation coefficient methods, i.e.,
Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall, were used to demonstrate the relevance among
samples. A four-fold cross-validation method was used to train, validate, and
test the proposed models. In all three datasets, the proposed deep neural network
(DNN) model achieved the highest values of accuracy, precision, recall or
sensitivity, specificity, F1-Score, AUC, and MCC. On average, accuracy 92.11%,
specificity 84.56%, and AUC 92.20% values have been obtained in the first
dataset. In the second dataset, on average, accuracy 93.16%, specificity 93.02%, 
and AUC 93.20% values have been obtained. Finally, in the third dataset, on
average, the values of accuracy 92.5%, specificity 85%, and AUC 92.20% have been 
obtained. In this study, we used a statistical t-test to validate the results.
Finally, using artificial intelligence interpretation methods, important and
impactful features in the developed model were presented. The proposed DNN model 
can be used as a supplementary tool for diagnosing COVID-19, which can quickly
provide clinicians with highly accurate diagnoses of positive cases in a timely
manner.
