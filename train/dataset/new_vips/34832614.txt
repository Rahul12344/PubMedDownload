Monocytes, one of the main target cells for dengue virus (DENV) infection,
contribute to the resolution of viremia and to pathogenesis. We performed a
longitudinal study by a detailed phenotypic comparison of classical (CD14++CD16-,
non-classical (CD14+CD16++) and intermediate (CD14++CD16+) monocyte subsets in
blood samples from dengue fever (DF) to the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
and healthy individuals. Various costimulatory molecules of CD40, CD80, CD86 and 
inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) expressed on these three monocyte subsets 
were also analyzed. DENV-infected patients showed an increase in the frequency of
intermediate monocytes and a decrease in the classical monocytes when compared to
healthy individuals. Although these differences did not correlate with disease
severity, changes during the early phase of infection gradually returned to
normal in the defervescence phase. Moreover, decreased frequency of classical
monocytes was associated with a significant up-regulation of co-stimulatory
molecules CD40, CD86 and ICOSL. Kinetics of these co-stimulatory
molecule-expressing classical monocytes showed different patterns throughout the 
sampling times of acute DENV infection. Different distribution of monocyte
subsets and their co-stimulatory molecules in the peripheral blood during acute
infection might exacerbate immune responses like cytokine storms and ADE, and
future studies on intracellular molecular pathways utilized by these monocyte
linages are warranted.
