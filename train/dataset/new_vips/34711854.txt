Exposure to poor air quality is considered a major influence on the occurrence of
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution has also been linked to
the severity of the effects of epidemics such as COVID-19 caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Epidemiological studies require datasets of the long-term
exposure to air pollution. We present the APExpose_DE dataset, a long-term
(2010-2019) dataset providing ambient air pollution metrics at yearly time
resolution for NO2, NO, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 at the NUTS-3 spatial resolution level
for Germany (corresponding to the Landkreis or Kreisfreie Stadt in Germany, 402
in total).
