Host cellular receptors play key roles in the determination of virus tropism and 
pathogenesis. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 host receptors with the
exception of ACE2. Furthermore, ACE2 alone cannot explain the multi-organ tropism
of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,
suggesting the involvement of other receptor(s). Here, we performed genomic
receptor profiling to screen 5054 human membrane proteins individually for
interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein. Twelve proteins,
including ACE2, ASGR1, and KREMEN1, were identified with diverse S-binding
affinities and patterns. ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient for the entry of
SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes distinct
ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) receptor combinations to enter different cell types, and
the expression of ASK together displays a markedly stronger correlation with
virus susceptibility than that of any individual receptor at both the cell and
tissue levels. The cocktail of ASK-related neutralizing antibodies provides the
most substantial blockage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids when
compared to individual antibodies. Our study revealed an interacting host
receptome of SARS-CoV-2, and identified ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as alternative
functional receptors that play essential roles in ACE2-independent virus entry,
providing insight into SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis, as well as a
community resource and potential therapeutic strategies for further COVID-19
investigations.
