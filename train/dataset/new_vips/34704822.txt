Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter
the cell. In our study, we aimed to investigate the role of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II plasma levels on prognosis and
mortality in patients with isolated hypertension, patients with chronic diseases 
in addition to hypertension and patients with COVID-19 without comorbidities, in 
accordance with the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor.
Materials & methods: In the study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were divided 
into three groups. Angiotensin II and ACE2 levels were compared by comorbidities,
antihypertensive drugs used, intensive care hospitalization and termination of
patients. The relationship between angiotensin II and ACE2 levels and service and
intensive care times was investigated. Findings: A total of 218 patients were
enrolled in our study, including 68 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without
comorbidities, 33 patients diagnosed with isolated hypertension and 117 patients 
with other chronic diseases in addition to hypertension. There was no
statistically significant difference between the comorbid disease groups between 
angiotensin II and ACE2 levels of the patients enrolled in the study. The rate of
patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 17.9%, and the mortality rate
was 11.5%. Results: In our study, we did not obtain significant findings
regarding angiotensin II and ACE2 levels on presentation that can be used in
prognosis and mortality of COVID-19 patients and development of future treatment 
methods.
