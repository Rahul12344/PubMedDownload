Tobacco bushy top disease (TBTD) is a devastating tobacco disease in the
southwestern region of China. TBTD in the Yunnan Province is often caused by
co-infections of several plant viruses: tobacco bushy top virus (TBTV), tobacco
vein distorting virus (TVDV), tobacco bushy top virus satellite RNA (TBTVsatRNA) 
and tobacco vein distorting virus-associated RNA (TVDVaRNA). Through this study, 
two new poleroviruses were identified in two TBTD symptomatic tobacco plants and 
these two novel viruses are tentatively named as tobacco polerovirus 1 (TPV1) and
tobacco polerovirus 2 (TPV2), respectively. Analyses of 244 tobacco samples
collected from tobacco fields in the Yunnan Province through RT-PCR showed that a
total of 80 samples were infected with TPV1 and/or TPV2, and the infection rates 
of TPV1 and TPV2 were 8.61% and 29.51%, respectively. Thirty-three TPV1 and/or
TPV2-infected tobacco samples were selected for further test for TBTV, TVDV,
TBTVsatRNA and TVDVaRNA infections. The results showed that many TPV1 and/or
TPV2-infected plants were also infected with two or more other assayed viruses.
In this study, we also surveyed TBTV, TVDV, TBTVsatRNA and TVDVaRNA infections in
a total of 1713 leaf samples collected from field plants belonging to 29 plant
species in 13 plant families and from 11 provinces/autonomous regions in China.
TVDV had the highest infection rates of 37.5%, while TVDVaRNA, TBTV and
TBTVsatRNA were found to be at 23.0%, 12.4% and 8.1%, respectively. In addition, 
TVDV, TBTV, TBTVsatRNA and TVDVaRNA were firstly detected of co-infection on 10
plants such as broad bean, pea, oilseed rape, pumpkin, tomato, crofton weed etc.,
and 1 to 4 of the TBTD causal agents were present in the samples collected from
Guizhou, Hainan, Henan, Liaoning, Inner mongolia and Tibet autonomous regions.
The results indicated that TBTD causal agents are expanding its host range and
posing a risk to other crop in the field.
