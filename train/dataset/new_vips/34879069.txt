Infection with the human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) subtype C is
endemic among Aboriginal people in central Australia. To provide insights into
the risk factors for transmission, we conducted the first large-scale,
community-based prevalence study in seven remote Aboriginal communities.
Residents >2 years old were invited to participate in the study between August
2014 and June 2018. HTLV-1 infection was defined as a positive western blot (WB) 
test or a positive HTLV-1 PCR. 720 community residents participated in the study 
(children <15 years, 142; adults, 578). Prevalences for children and adults were 
3.5% (5/142) and 36.8% (213/578), respectively, reaching 49.3% (106/215) for
those older than 45 years. A wide range of proviral loads were measured for both 
asymptomatic and symptomatic participants with no difference within groups
according to age or gender; however, median PVL was 1.34 log10 higher for
symptomatic participants. The adult prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in central
Australia is the highest reported worldwide. Sexual contact is likely to be the
predominant mode of transmission.
