We report a novel mycovirus with a positive-sense single-stranded (+)ss RNA
genome, belonging to the family Hypoviridae, infecting Trichoderma harzianum
strain M6. The complete genome sequence is 13,813 nucleotides long, excluding the
poly(A) tail at the 3' end. Sequence analysis revealed that the genome has a
single large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 4,118-amino-acid polyprotein
harboring five conserved motifs of a protease, two conserved domains of a protein
of unknown function, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and a helicase. Sequence
comparisons revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the polyprotein is
similar to those of other hypoviruses and is most similar to that of Bipolaris
oryzae hypovirus 1 (35.1% identity). Phylogenetic analysis using full-length RdRp
and helicase sequences showed that this virus clustered closely with known
members of the proposed genus "Alphahypovirus" of the family Hypoviridae. We
accordingly designated this novel mycovirus "Trichoderma harzianum hypovirus 2"
(ThHV2).
