BACKGROUND: Québec was the Canadian province most impacted by COVID-19, with
401,462 cases as of September 24th, 2021, and 11,347 deaths due mostly to a very 
severe first pandemic wave. In April 2020, we assembled the Coronavirus
Sequencing in Québec (CoVSeQ) consortium to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Québec
to track viral introduction events and transmission within the province.
METHODS: Using genomic epidemiology, we investigated the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to
Québec. We report 2921 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the context of > 12,000
publicly available genomes sampled globally over the first pandemic wave (up to
June 1st, 2020). By combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses with
epidemiological data, we quantify the number of introduction events into Québec, 
identify their origins, and characterize the spatiotemporal spread of the virus.
RESULTS: Conservatively, we estimated approximately 600 independent introduction 
events, the majority of which happened from spring break until 2 weeks after the 
Canadian border closed for non-essential travel. Subsequent mass repatriations
did not generate large transmission lineages (> 50 sequenced cases), likely due
to mandatory quarantine measures in place at the time. Consistent with common
spring break and "snowbird" destinations, most of the introductions were inferred
to have originated from Europe via the Americas. Once introduced into Québec,
viral lineage sizes were overdispersed, with a few lineages giving rise to most
infections. Consistent with founder effects, the earliest lineages to arrive
tended to spread most successfully. Fewer than 100 viral introductions arrived
during spring break, of which 7-12 led to the largest transmission lineages of
the first wave (accounting for 52-75% of all sequenced infections). These
successful transmission lineages dispersed widely across the province.
Transmission lineage size was greatly reduced after March 11th, when a quarantine
order for returning travellers was enacted. While this suggests the effectiveness
of early public health measures, the biggest transmission lineages had already
been ignited prior to this order.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined, our results reinforce how, in the absence of tight travel 
restrictions or quarantine measures, fewer than 100 viral introductions in a week
can ensure the establishment of extended transmission chains.
