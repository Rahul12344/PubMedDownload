Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) driven by viruses or bacteria, as well
as in numerous immune-mediated disorders. Histone citrullination by the enzyme
peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) and the consequent decondensation of
chromatin are hallmarks in the induction of NETs. Nevertheless, additional
histone modifications that may govern NETosis are largely overlooked. Herein, we 
show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) play critical roles in driving NET
formation in human and mouse neutrophils. HDACs belonging to the zinc-dependent
lysine deacetylases family are necessary to deacetylate histone H3, thus allowing
the activity of PAD4 and NETosis. Of note, HDAC inhibition in mice protects
against microbial-induced pneumonia and septic shock, decreasing NETosis and
inflammation. Collectively, our findings illustrate a new fundamental step that
governs the release of NETs and points to HDAC inhibitors as therapeutic agents
that may be used to protect against ARDS and sepsis.
