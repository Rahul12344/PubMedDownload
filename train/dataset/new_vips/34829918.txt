The "cytokine storm" (CS) consists of a spectrum of different immune
dysregulation disorders characterized by constitutional symptoms, systemic
inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction triggered by an uncontrolled immune
response. Particularly in respiratory virus infections, the cytokine storm plays 
a primary role in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease and the clinical
outcome of respiratory diseases, leading to complications such as alveolar edema 
and hypoxia. In this review, we wanted to analyze the different pathogenetic
mechanisms involved in the various respiratory viral pandemics (COVID-19; SARS;
MERS; H1N1 influenza A and Spanish flu) which have affected humans in this and
last century, with particular attention to the phenomenon of the "cytokine storm"
which determines the clinical severity of the respiratory disease and
consequently its lethality.
