To study the clinical features of infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mixed with Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) or/and
cytomegalovirus (CMV)infection, collected 201 hospitalized children who met the
IM diagnostic criteria, the clinical manifestations, laboratory tests,
complications, treatment, and outcome were compared among EBV infection alone and
EBV mixed with MP or/and CMV infection. Most of the children with IM were
preschoolers, more frequently occurred in boys than girls. EBV patients with MP
had the longest duration of fever. When mixed pathogen infections were involved, 
the white blood cell count of preschool children was significantly increased,
while splenomegaly was more common in older children. In the cases of EBV
infection alone, abnormal liver function was positively correlated with age (P = 
0.044). Mixed pathogen infections were more common in children with IM, occurring
in all age groups, and some clinical characteristics were related to the age of
onset and the pathogen of the infection.
