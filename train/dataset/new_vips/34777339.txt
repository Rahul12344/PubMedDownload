Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection is a serious complication that
arise in patients who undergo hepatitis B virus related liver transplantation. We
aimed to use biomarkers to evaluate the HBV reinfection in patients after
orthotopic liver transplantation.
Methods: Seventy-nine patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2009
and 2015 were enrolled, and levels of biomarkers were analyzed at different time 
points. Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of
different markers at baseline were used to analyze sustained hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) loss. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the levels of
the biomarkers.
Results: Among the 79 patients, 42 sustained HBsAg loss with a median time of
65.2 months (12.0-114.5, IQR 19.5) after liver transplantation and 37 patients
exhibited HBsAg recurrence with a median time of 8.8 (0.47-59.53, IQR 19.47)
months. In the ROC curve analysis, at baseline, 4.25 log10 IU/mL qHBcAb and 2.82 
log10 IU/mL qHBsAg showed the maximum Youden's index values with area under the
curves (AUCs) of 0.685and 0.651, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method indicated 
that qHBsAg and quantitative antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (qHBcAb)
levels in the two groups were significantly different (p = 0.031 and 0.006,
respectively). Furthermore, the Cox regression model confirmed the predictive
ability of qHBcAb at baseline (AUC = 0.685).
Conclusion: Lower pretransplantation qHBcAb is associated with HBV infection. The
baseline concentration of qHBcAb is a promising predictor for the recurrence of
HBV in patients undergoing liver transplantation and can be used to guide
antiviral treatment for HBV infection.
