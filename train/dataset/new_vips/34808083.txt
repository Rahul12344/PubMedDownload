We conducted a survey for group-specific indirect immunofluorescence antibody to 
mammarenaviruses by using Lassa fever and Mopeia virus antigens on serum
specimens of 5,363 rodents of 33 species collected in South Africa and Zimbabwe
during 1964-1994. Rodents were collected for unrelated purposes or for this study
and stored at -70Â°C. We found antibody to be widely distributed in the 2
countries; antibody was detected in serum specimens of 1.2%-31.8% of 14 species
of myomorph rodents, whereas 19 mammarenavirus isolates were obtained from serum 
specimens and viscera of 4 seropositive species. Phylogenetic analysis on the
basis of partial nucleoprotein sequences indicates that 14 isolates from Mastomys
natalensis, the Natal multimammate mouse, were Mopeia virus, whereas Merino Walk 
virus was characterized as a novel virus in a separate study. The remaining 4
isolates from 3 rodent species potentially constitute novel viruses pending full 
characterization.
