Rapid and unchecked industrialization and the combustion of fossil fuels have
engendered a state of fear in urban settlements. Smog is a visible form of air
pollution that arises due to the over-emissions of some primary pollutants like
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrocarbons, SO2, NO, and NO2 which further
react in the atmosphere and give rise to toxic and carcinogenic secondary smog
components. Smog reduces the visibility on roads and results in road accidents
and cancellation of flights. Uptake of primary and secondary pollutants of smog
is responsible for several deleterious diseases of which respiratory disorders,
cardiovascular dysfunction, neurological disorders, and cancer are discussed
here. Children and pregnant women are more prone to the hazards of smog. The
worsening menace of smog on one hand and occurrence of pandemic i.e., COVID-19 on
the other may increase the mortality rate. But the implementation of lockdown
during pandemics has favored the atmosphere in some ways, which will be
highlighted in the article. On the whole, the focus of this article will be on
the dubious relationship between smog and coronavirus.
