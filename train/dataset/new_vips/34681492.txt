In the latest One Health ECDC EFSA technical report, Norovirus in fish and
fishery products have been listed as the agent/food pair causing the highest
number of strong-evidence outbreaks in the EU in 2019. This review aims to
identify data gaps that must be filled in order to increase knowledge on
Norovirus in bivalve molluscs, perform a risk assessment and rank the key
mitigation strategies for this biological hazard, which is relevant to public
health. Virologic determinations are not included in any of the food safety and
process hygiene microbiologic criteria reflected in the current European
regulations. In addition, the Escherichia coli-based indices of acceptable faecal
contamination for primary production, as well as the food safety criteria, do not
appear sufficient to indicate the extent of Norovirus contamination. The
qualitative risk assessment data collected in this review suggests that bivalve
molluscs present a high risk to human health for Norovirus only when consumed raw
or when insufficiently cooked. On the contrary, the risk can be considered
negligible when they are cooked at a high temperature, while information is still
scarce for non-thermal treatments.
