A 37-year-old man presented with jaundice, upper right quadrant pain, and
intermittent fever with chills. Laboratory assessment showed biliary stasis, with
total bilirubin of 203 µmol/L (2-20), conjugated bilirubin of 105 µmol/L, and
alkaline phosphatase of 556 U/L (30-120). Markers for hepatitis A-E viruses were 
negative. Serology assessment for rubeola, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr
virus, and Toxoplasma gondii showed negative IgM antibodies. HIV serology status 
was negative. For cytomegalovirus, both types of antibodies (IgM and IgG) were
positive, with an IgM level >300 U/mL. pp65 antigen was also detected as well as 
CMV DNA. Diagnostic imaging of the abdomen except the dilated common bile duct
showed a normal appearance of the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, spleen, and both 
kidneys. To our knowledge, cytomegalovirus cholangiopathy in the absence of any
other underlying disease has not been reported. Therefore, the presence of
cholangiopathy in our patient is interesting from an imaging, laboratory, and
clinical point of view.
