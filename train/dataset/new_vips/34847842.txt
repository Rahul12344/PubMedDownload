Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
provokes acute inflammation due to extensive replication of the virus in the
epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory system. The mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) is a l signalling protein with critical functions in cell
growth, metabolism, and proliferation. It is known for its regulatory functions
in protein synthesis and angiogenesis cascades. The structure of mTOR consists of
two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with diverse functions at different
levels of the signaling pathway. By activating mRNA translation, the mTORC1 plays
a key role in regulating protein synthesis and cellular growth. On the other
hand, the functions of mTORC2 are mainly associated with cell proliferation and
survival. By using an appropriate inhibitor at the right time, mTOR modulation
could provide immunosuppressive opportunities as antirejection regimens in organ 
transplantation as well as in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and solid
tumours. The mTOR has an important role in the inflammatory process, too.
Inhibitors of mTOR might indeed be promising agents in the treatment of viral
infections. They have further been successfully used in patients with severe
influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The officially accepted
mTOR inhibitors that have undergone clinical testing are sirolimus, everolimus,
temsirolimus, and tacrolimus. Thus, further studies on mTOR inhibitors for
SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 therapy are well merited.
