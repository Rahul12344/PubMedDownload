INTRODUCTION: unCoVer-Unravelling data for rapid evidence-based response to
COVID-19-is a Horizon 2020-funded network of 29 partners from 18 countries
capable of collecting and using real-world data (RWD) derived from the response
and provision of care to patients with COVID-19 by health systems across Europe
and elsewhere. unCoVer aims to exploit the full potential of this information to 
rapidly address clinical and epidemiological research questions arising from the 
evolving pandemic.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, partners are
gathering RWD from electronic health records currently including information from
over 22 000 hospitalised patients with COVID-19, and national surveillance and
screening data, and registries with over 1 900 000 COVID-19 cases across Europe, 
with continuous updates. These heterogeneous datasets will be described,
harmonised and integrated into a multi-user data repository operated through
Opal-DataSHIELD, an interoperable open-source server application. Federated data 
analyses, without sharing or disclosing any individual-level data, will be
performed with the objective to reveal patients' baseline characteristics,
biomarkers, determinants of COVID-19 prognosis, safety and effectiveness of
treatments, and potential strategies against COVID-19, as well as epidemiological
patterns. These analyses will complement evidence from efficacy/safety clinical
trials, where vulnerable, more complex/heterogeneous populations and those most
at risk of severe COVID-19 are often excluded.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: After strict ethical considerations, databases will be 
available through a federated data analysis platform that allows processing of
available COVID-19 RWD without disclosing identification information to analysts 
and limiting output to data aggregates. Dissemination of unCoVer's activities
will be related to the access and use of dissimilar RWD, as well as the results
generated by the pooled analyses. Dissemination will include training and
educational activities, scientific publications and conference communications.
