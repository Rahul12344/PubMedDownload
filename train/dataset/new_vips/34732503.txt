OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations of physical activity level with
COVID-19 mortality risk across body mass index (BMI) categories, and to determine
whether any protective association of a higher physical activity level in
individuals with obesity may be explained by favourable levels of cardiometabolic
and inflammatory biomarkers.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (baseline data collected between 2006 and 2010).
Physical activity level was assessed using the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (high: ≥3000 Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-min/week, moderate:
≥600 MET-min/week, low: not meeting either criteria), and biochemical assays were
conducted on blood samples to provide biomarker data.
SETTING: UK Biobank.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regressions adjusted for potential confounders
were performed to determine the associations of exposure variables with COVID-19 
mortality risk. Mortality from COVID-19 was ascertained by death certificates
through linkage with National Health Service (NHS) Digital.
RESULTS: Within the 259 397 included participants, 397 COVID-19 deaths occurred
between 16 March 2020 and 27 February 2021. Compared with highly active
individuals with a normal BMI (reference group), the ORs (95% CIs) for COVID-19
mortality were 1.61 (0.98 to 2.64) for highly active individuals with obesity,
2.85 (1.78 to 4.57) for lowly active individuals with obesity and 1.94 (1.04 to
3.61) for lowly active individuals with a normal BMI. Of the included biomarkers,
neutrophil count and monocyte count were significantly positively associated with
COVID-19 mortality risk. In a subanalysis restricted to individuals with obesity,
adjusting for these biomarkers attenuated the higher COVID-19 mortality risk in
lowly versus highly active individuals with obesity by 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence suggesting that a high physical
activity level may attenuate the COVID-19 mortality risk associated with obesity.
Although the protective association may be partly explained by lower neutrophil
and monocyte counts, it still remains largely unexplained by the biomarkers
included in this analysis.
