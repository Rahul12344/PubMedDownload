COVID-19 heavily affects breathing and voice and causes symptoms that make
patients' voices distinctive, creating recognizable audio signatures. Initial
studies have already suggested the potential of using voice as a screening
solution. In this article we present a dataset of voice, cough and breathing
audio recordings collected from individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well
as non-infected subjects via large scale crowdsourced campaign. We describe
preliminary results for detection of COVID-19 from cough patterns using standard 
acoustic features sets, wavelet scattering features and deep audio embeddings
extracted from low-level feature representations (VGGish and OpenL3). Our models 
achieve accuracy of 88.52%, sensitivity of 88.75% and specificity of 90.87%,
confirming the applicability of audio signatures to identify COVID-19 symptoms.
We furthermore provide an in-depth analysis of the most informative acoustic
features and try to elucidate the mechanisms that alter the acoustic
characteristics of coughs of people with COVID-19.
