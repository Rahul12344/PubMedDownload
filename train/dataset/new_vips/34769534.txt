Higher education has been shifted toward blended learning during the COVID-19
pandemic. An increase in social media usage intensity and reduced face-to-face
interaction due to the COVID-19 pandemic urged instructional communication
researchers to revisit the dynamics of learners' group development in terms of
their socialization and academic performance during the COVID-19 crisis. This
research aimed to determine the mediating role of social media sociability
between face-to-face socialization and academic performance of higher education
students in blended learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was
also the aim of the study to determine the moderating effect of social media
usage intensity on social media sociability. A cross-sectional survey was
conducted with the students (n = 340) enrolled in science teacher education
departments of universities in Pakistan. Partial least squares structural
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for multivariate analysis. Results revealed 
that face-to-face socialization gave an essential start to develop a learning
group. However, when face-to-face socialization was reduced due to the COVID-19
pandemic, it was mediated by social media usage in blended learning environments 
to increase their socialization and academic performance during the crisis. The
findings of the study are useful for higher education institutions to adopt
social media strategies for students' socialization during the crisis.
