Viral transcription is an essential step of SARS-CoV-2 infection after invasion
into the target cells. Antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, which is used to treat
COVID-19 patients, targets the viral RNA synthesis. Understanding the mechanism
of viral transcription may help to develop new therapeutic treatment by
perturbing virus replication. In this study, we established 28 ddPCR assays and
designed specific primers/probe sets to detect the RNA levels of 15 NSP, 9 ORF,
and 4 structural genes of SARS-CoV-2. The transcriptional kinetics of these viral
genes were determined longitudinally from the beginning of infection to 12 h
postinfection in Caco-2 cells. We found that SARS-CoV-2 takes around 6 h to
hijack the cells before the initiation of viral transcription process in human
cells. Our results may contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
