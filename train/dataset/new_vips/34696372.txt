Nipah virus (NiV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) possess two surface
glycoproteins involved in cellular attachment and membrane fusion, both of which 
are potential targets for vaccines. The majority of vaccine development is
focused on the attachment (G) protein of NiV, which is the immunodominant target.
In contrast, the fusion (F) protein of RSV is the main target in vaccine
development. Despite this, neutralising epitopes have been described in NiV F and
RSV G, making them alternate targets for vaccine design. Through rational design,
we have developed a vaccine strategy applicable to phylogenetically divergent NiV
and RSV that comprises both the F and G proteins (FxG). In a mouse immunization
model, we found that NiV FxG elicited an improved immune response capable of
neutralising pseudotyped NiV and a NiV mutant that is able to escape
neutralisation by two known F-specific antibodies. RSV FxG elicited an immune
response against both F and G and was able to neutralise RSV; however, this was
inferior to the immune response of F alone. Despite this, RSV FxG elicited a
response against a known protective epitope within G that is conserved across RSV
A and B subgroups, which may provide additional protection in vivo. We conclude
that inclusion of F and G antigens within a single design provides a streamlined 
subunit vaccine strategy against both emerging and established pathogens, with
the potential for broader protection against NiV.
