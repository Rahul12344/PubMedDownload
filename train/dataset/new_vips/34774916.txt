Tumors with a low level of pre-existing immune cell infiltration respond poorly
to immune checkpoint therapies. Oncolytic viruses optimize immunotherapies by
modulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting multiple steps in the
cancer-immunity cycle, making them an attractive agent for combination
strategies. We engineered an HSV-1-based oncolytic virus and investigated its
antitumor effects in combination with the marketed PD-1 antibody Keytruda
(pembrolizumab) in hPD-1 knock-in mice bearing non-immunogenic B16-F10 melanoma. 
Our results showed enhanced CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration, IFN-γ secretion
and PD-L1 expression in tumors, subsequently leading to the prolonged overall
survival of mice. Systemic changes in lymphocyte cell proportions were also
observed in the peripheral blood. In summary, these findings provide evidence
that oncolytic viruses can be engineered as a potential platform for combination 
therapies, especially to treat tumors that are poorly responsive to immune
checkpoint therapy.
