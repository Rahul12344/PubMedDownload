Melanoma differentiation associated factor 5 (MDA5), which belongs to the
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) family, has been
proved to be a key pattern recognition receptor of innate antiviral signaling in 
duck, which plays an important role in anti-Tembusu virus (TMUV) infection.
However, laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), the third member of RLRs
family, the regulatory function on antiviral innate immunity of MDA5 is currently
unclear. In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization of duck LGP2
(duLGP2) and confirmed that it is an important regulator of the duMDA5-mediated
host innate antiviral immune response. The present experimental data demonstrate 
that the overexpression of duLGP2 inhibits duMDA5 downstream transcriptional
factor (IRF-7, IFN-β, and NF-κB) promoter activity, and duMDA5-mediated type I
IFNs and ISGs expression were significantly suppressed by duLGP2 regardless of
viral infection in vitro. The inhibition of duLGP2 on the antiviral activity of
duMDA5 ultimately leads to an increase in viral replication. However, the
overexpression of duLGP2 promotes expression of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
protein (MAVS) and duMDA5-mediated proinflammatory cytokines. This study provides
a new rationale support for the duLGP2 regulates duMDA5-mediated anti-viral
immune signaling pathway theory in duck.
