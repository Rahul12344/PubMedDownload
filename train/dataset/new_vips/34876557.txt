Runt-related transcription factor-1 (Runx1) is required for
chondrocyte-to-osteoblast lineage commitment by enhancing both chondrogenesis and
osteogenesis during vertebrate development. However, the potential role of Runx1 
in joint diseases is not well known. In the current study, we aimed to explore
the role of Runx1 in osteoarthritis induced by anterior cruciate ligament
transaction (ACLT) surgery. We showed that chondrocyte-specific Runx1 knockout
(Runx1f/fCol2a1-Cre) aggravated cartilage destruction by accelerating the loss of
proteoglycan and collagen II in early osteoarthritis. Moreover, we observed
thinning and ossification of the growth plate, a decrease in chondrocyte
proliferative capacity and the loss of bone matrix around the growth plate in
late osteoarthritis. We overexpressed Runx1 by adeno-associated virus (AAV) in
articular cartilage and identified its protective effect by slowing the
destruction of osteoarthritis in cartilage in early osteoarthritis and
alleviating the pathological progression of growth plate cartilage in late
osteoarthritis. ChIP-seq analysis identified new targets that interacted with
Runx1 in cartilage pathology, and we confirmed the direct interactions of these
factors with Runx1 by ChIP-qPCR. This study helps us to understand the function
of Runx1 in osteoarthritis and provides new clues for targeted osteoarthritis
therapy.
