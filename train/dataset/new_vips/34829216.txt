Sweet potato is the 11th most important food crop in the world and an excellent
source of nutrition. Postharvest diseases were monitored in sweet potato storage 
roots collected from the local markets in Korea during 2021. Several diseases
including Fusarium surface and root rot, charcoal rot, dry rot, and soft rot were
observed in the postharvest sweet potatoes. A total of 68 fungal isolates were
obtained from the diseased samples, and the isolates were grouped into 8
different fungal colony types. Based on multilocus phylogeny and morphological
analysis of 17 representative isolates, the isolates were identified as Fusarium 
oxysporum, F. ipomoeae, F. solani, Penicillium citrinum, P.&nbsp;rotoruae,
Aspergillus&nbsp;wentii, Mucor&nbsp;variicolumellatus (Mu. circinelloides species
complex), and Macrophomina phaseolina. F. oxysporum was the predominant pathogen 
as this is the most common pathogen of sweet potato storage roots causing the
surface rot disease, and M. phaseolina caused the most severe disease among the
pathogens. Dual culture antagonistic assays were evaluated using Trichoderma
harzianum strains CMML20-26 and CMML20-27. The results revealed that the two
strains showed strong antifungal activity in different ranges against all tested 
pathogens. This study provides an understanding of diverse postharvest diseases
in sweet potatoes and suggests potential biocontrol agents to manage the
diseases. In addition, this is the first report of sweet potato storage root rot 
diseases caused by A. wentii, and P. rotoruae worldwide.
