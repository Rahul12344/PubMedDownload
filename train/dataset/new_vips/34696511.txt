The cottony grape scale Pulvinaria vitis is a scale insect colonizing grapevine; 
however, its capacity as a vector of grapevine viruses is poorly known in
comparison to other scale species that are vectors of viral species in the genera
Ampelovirus and Vitivirus. The ability of P. vitis to transmit the ampeloviruses 
Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses [GLRaV]-1, -3, and -4, and the vitivirus
Grapevine virus A (GVA), to healthy vine cuttings was assessed. The scale insects
used originated from commercial vine plots located in Alsace, Eastern France.
When nymphs sampled from leafroll-infected vineyard plants were transferred onto 
healthy cuttings, only one event of transmission was obtained. However, when
laboratory-reared, non-viruliferous nymphs were allowed to acquire viruses under 
controlled conditions, both first and second instar nymphs derived from two
vineyards were able to transmit GLRaV-1 and GVA. This is the first report of
GLRaV-1 and GVA transmission from grapevine to grapevine by this species.
