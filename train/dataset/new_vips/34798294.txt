Plant viral diseases accounts for major global economic losses in modern-day
agriculture. Plant viral disease management is the primary challenge for both
farmers and researchers. Detection and identification of plant viruses are of
paramount importance for successful management of a viral disease. Recent
advancements in molecular biology have contributed to significant progress in the
development of new, sensitive, and effective diagnostic methods. However, most
techniques are neither time/cost-effective nor user-friendly and require
sophisticated labs. Hence, the past few decades of agricultural research have
mainly focused on developing farmer-friendly, point-of-care diagnostic tools that
provide high-sensitive rapid diagnosis. The current trend in plant virus
diagnostic tools is cheaper, easy-to-use portable devices with no compromise on
sensitivity and reproducibility.
