BACKGROUND: Human resources management plays an important role in social
development and economic growth. Absence from work due to health problems can
make obstacles to the growth of economy. This study conducted aimed to estimate
the absenteeism costs of COVID-19 among the personnel of hospitals affiliated to 
Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Mashhad, Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between February 19, 2020, and 
September 21, 2020. The absenteeism costs were calculated using the human capital
approach. Finally, we applied the linear regression to assess the impact of
variables on the lost productivity of absenteeism due to COVID-19 among the
personnel of hospitals affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.
RESULTS: The results of this study showed that 1958 personnel had COVID-19. The
total of absenteeism days in our study were 32,209 days, with an average of 16.44
absenteeism days. Total costs due to absenteeism were estimated to be nearly $1.3
million, with an average of $671.4 per patient. The results of regression model
showed that gender (male), age (> 50 years), employment Type (non-permanent) and 
monthly income had a positive relationship with the absenteeism cost. Also, there
are a negative significant relationship between absenteeism cost with job
(physicians) and work experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Absenteeism costs of COVID-19 in the hospitals of Mashhad University
of Medical Sciences represent a significant economic burden. The findings of our 
study emphasize the emergency strategies to prevent and control COVID-19 among
the healthcare workers. It can decrease the economic impacts of COVID-19 and
improve human resources management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
