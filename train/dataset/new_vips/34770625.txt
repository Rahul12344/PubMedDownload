This article proposes a new method for detecting slight refractive index changes 
under conditions of unknown polarization state. It is argued that an
insignificant modification of the tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) structure and
selecting the appropriate spectral region allows us to accurately track changes
in the refractive index. It has also been proven that the method can be easily
made insensitive to temperature and that the sensitivity to changes in the
polarization plane of the input light can be significantly reduced, which is
crucial in later practical applications. Analytes in the form of an aqueous
glucose solution were used to calibrate the sensor. The proposed method, based on
perpendicular tilted fiber Bragg grating (P-TFBG), has a wide range of
universality because its development and slight modification will enable the
detection of glucose, pathogens, and viruses.
