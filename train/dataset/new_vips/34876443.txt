In amplified natural killer (ANK) cell immunotherapy, NK cells are extracted from
the patient's blood, cultured for enhancing its anticancer effects and amplified 
before they are returned to the body. Here, we administered ANK therapy to an
81-year-old female patient diagnosed with smouldering human T cell leukaemia
virus-associated bronchioloalveolar disorder. After eight sessions of
twice-weekly NK cell infusion, the bilateral diffuse granular shadows on a CT
scan and the overall respiratory function improved markedly. Later, the patient
received outpatient treatment without serious side effects. Thus, ANK therapy may
be safe for elderly patients owing to its infrequent side effects.
