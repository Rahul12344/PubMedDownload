Pulmonary epithelial cells are widely considered to be the first line of defence 
in the lung and are responsible for coordinating the innate immune response to
injury and subsequent repair. Consequently, epithelial cells communicate with
multiple cell types including immune cells and fibroblasts to promote acute
inflammation and normal wound healing in response to damage. However, aberrant
epithelial cell death and damage are hallmarks of pulmonary disease, with
necrotic cell death and cellular senescence contributing to disease pathogenesis 
in numerous respiratory diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. 
In this review, we summarise the literature that demonstrates that epithelial
damage plays a pivotal role in the dysregulation of the immune response leading
to tissue destruction and abnormal remodelling in several chronic diseases.
Specifically, we highlight the role of epithelial-derived damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) and senescence in shaping the immune response and
assess their contribution to inflammatory and fibrotic signalling pathways in the
lung.
