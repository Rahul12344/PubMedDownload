The search for effective methods to detect patients who excrete a viable virus is
one of the urgent tasks of modern biomedicine. In the present study, we examined 
the diagnostic value of two antigen tests, BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag (RapiGEN Inc.,
Anyang, Korea) and SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag (Sugentech Inc., Cheongju, Korea), for
their diagnostic value in identifying patients who excrete viable SARS-CoV-2. As 
part of the study, we examined samples from 106 patients who had just been
admitted to the hospital and who had undergone quantitative RT-PCR and assessment
of viability of SARS-CoV-2 using cell culture. Assessment of the tests' value for
detecting samples containing viable virus showed high sensitivity for both tests.
Sensitivity was 78.6% (95% CI, from 49.2% to 95.3%) for SGTI-flex COVID-19 Ag and
100% (95% CI, from 76.8% to 100%) for Biocredit COVID-19 Ag. The specificity of
rapid tests was significantly higher than that of RT-PCR and was 66.3% (95% CI,
from 55.7% to 75.8%) and 67.4% (95% CI, from 56.8% to 76.8%) for SGTI-flex
COVID-19 Ag and Biocredit COVID-19 Ag versus 30.4% (95% CI, from 21.3% to 40.9%) 
obtained for PCR. Thus, for tasks of identifying viable SARS-CoV-2 during
screening of conditionally healthy people, as well as monitoring those
quarantined, rapid tests show significantly better results.
