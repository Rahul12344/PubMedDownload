Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy infects fetal trophoblasts and causes
placental damage and birth defects including microcephaly. Little is known about 
the anti-ZIKV cellular immune response at the maternal-fetal interface. Decidual 
natural killer cells (dNK), which directly contact fetal trophoblasts, are the
dominant maternal immune cells in the first-trimester placenta, when ZIKV
infection is most hazardous. Although dNK express all the cytolytic molecules
needed to kill, they usually do not kill infected fetal cells but promote
placentation. Here, we show that dNK degranulate and kill ZIKV-infected placental
trophoblasts. ZIKV infection of trophoblasts causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress, which makes them dNK targets by down-regulating HLA-C/G, natural killer
(NK) inhibitory receptor ligands that help maintain tolerance of the
semiallogeneic fetus. ER stress also activates the NK activating receptor NKp46. 
ZIKV infection of Ifnar1 -/- pregnant mice results in high viral titers and
severe intrauterine growth restriction, which are exacerbated by depletion of NK 
or CD8 T cells, indicating that killer lymphocytes, on balance, protect the fetus
from ZIKV by eliminating infected cells and reducing the spread of infection.
