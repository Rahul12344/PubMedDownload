OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of contacts of patients with COVID-19 
case in terms of time, place and person, to calculate the secondary attack rate
(SAR) and factors associated with COVID-19 infection among contacts.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Contacts of cases 
identified by the health department from 14 March 2020to 30 May 2020, in 9 of 38 
administrative districts of Tamil Nadu. Significant proportion of cases attended 
a religious congregation.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Attack rate among the contacts and factors associated with
COVID-19 positivity.
RESULTS: We listed 15 702 contacts of 931 primary cases. Of the contacts, 89% (n:
14 002) were tested for COVID-19. The overall SAR was 4% (599/14 002), with
higher among the household contacts (13%) than the community contacts (1%). SAR
among the contacts of primary cases with congregation exposure were 5 times
higher than the contacts of non-congregation primary cases (10% vs 2%). Being a
household contact of a primary case with congregation exposure had a fourfold
increased risk of getting COVID-19 (relative risk (RR): 16.4; 95% CI: 13 to 20)
than contact of primary case without congregation exposure. Among the symptomatic
primary cases, household contacts of congregation primaries had higher RR than
household contacts of other cases ((RR: 25.3; 95% CI: 10.2 to 63) vs (RR: 14.6;
95% CI: 5.7 to 37.7)). Among asymptomatic primary case, RR was increased among
household contacts (RR: 16.5; 95% CI: 13.2 to 20.7) of congregation primaries
compared with others.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed an increase in disease transmission among household 
contacts than community contacts. Also, symptomatic primary cases and primary
cases with exposure to the congregation had more secondary cases than others.
