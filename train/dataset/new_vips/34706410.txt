BACKGROUND: Longitudinal data indicates that the mental health of the general
population may not have been as badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as some
had feared. Most studies examining change in mental health during the pandemic
have assumed population homogeneity which may conceal evidence of worsening
mental health for some. In this study, we applied a heterogeneous perspective to 
determine if there were distinct groups in the population characterised by
different patterns of change in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic.
METHODS: Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative sample 
of Irish adults (N = 1041) at four time-points between April and December 2020.
RESULTS: In the entire sample, mean levels of internalizing symptoms
significantly declined from March to December 2020. However, we identified four
distinct groups with different patterns of change. The most common response was
'Resilience' (66.7%), followed by 'Improving' (17.9%), 'Worsening' (11.3%), and
'Sustained' (4.1%). Belonging to the 'Worsening' class was associated with
younger age, city dwelling, current and past treatment for a mental health
problem, higher levels of empathy, and higher levels of loneliness.
LIMITATIONS: Sample attrition was relatively high and although this was managed
using robust statistical methods, bias associated with non-responses cannot be
entirely ruled out.
CONCLUSION: The majority of adults experienced no change, or an improvement in
internalizing symptoms during the pandemic, and a relatively small proportion of 
adults experienced a worsening of internalizing symptoms. Limited public mental
health resources should be targeted toward helping these at-risk individuals.
