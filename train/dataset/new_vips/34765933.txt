Introduction: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) Type 2 primarily causes genital herpes, 
while HSV Type 1 is responsible for oral and facial lesions. The objective of
this study was to isolate and characterize HSV from herpetic lesions among human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients and to evaluate their acyclovir
susceptibility pattern.
Materials and Methods: Blister fluid and swabs from ulcers were collected from
patients with clinical diagnosis of HSV infection among patients attending the
HIV clinic of two tertiary care centers - Medical College, Kolkata, and School of
Tropical Medicine, Kolkata. These samples were cultured in the Vero cell line.
Growth of virus was noted by observing the characteristic cytopathic effect of
HSV, which was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). These isolates were then subjected to the Vero cells with serial 
dilutions of acyclovir for determining the susceptibility pattern.
Results: Among the 52 samples received, 8 (15.38%) showed growth of HSV. After
confirmation by immunofluorescence and PCR, all seven isolates from genital
samples were identified as HSV-2 and the lone isolate from oral lesion was
confirmed as HSV 1. Out of the eight isolates, 25% showed resistance to
acyclovir. The overall isolation rate was more from genital blister than genital 
ulcer which was 46.15% and 2.86%, respectively.
Conclusion: HSV was isolated in 15.38% of cases of clinical herpes. There was a
higher isolation rate of virus from blister fluid as compared to ulcer scrapings.
Acyclovir resistance in 25% of cases is alarmingly high.
