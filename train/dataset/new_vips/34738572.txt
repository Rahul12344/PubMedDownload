Respiratory involvement is the most common clinical manifestation of COVID-19,
but neurological symptoms and complications are increasingly being recognized.
Seizures and status epilepticus (SE) have been described as possible consequences
of hypoxia and metabolic derangements during SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct viral
invasion of the central nervous system, or as para or post-infectious
complications. Single episodes of SE have been described, occurring during the
acute phase of COVID-19 or once the patients have been recovered. Herein, we
present the case of a patient with a positive serology test for SARS-CoV-2 (IgG+,
IgM-) and recurrent SE occurring within 36 days. Diagnostic work-up ruled out
other known causes of SE. A post-COVID-19 infectious inflammatory/immune response
is hypothesized as the possible trigger of SE.
