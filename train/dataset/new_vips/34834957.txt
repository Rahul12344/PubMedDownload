Hantaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that can cause serious human disorders,
including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome. As the main risk factor for human infections is the interaction with
rodents, occupational groups such as farmers and forestry workers are reportedly 
at high risk, but no summary evidence has been collected to date. Therefore, we
searched two different databases (PubMed and EMBASE), focusing on studies
reporting the prevalence of hantaviruses in farmers and forestry workers. Data
were extracted using a standardized assessment form, and results of such analyses
were systematically reported, summarized and compared. We identified a total of
42 articles, including a total of 28 estimates on farmers, and 22 on forestry
workers, with a total workforce of 15,043 cases (821 positive cases, 5.5%). A
pooled seroprevalence of 3.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.2-6.2) was
identified in farmers, compared to 3.8% (95% CI 2.6-5.7) in forestry workers.
Compared to the reference population, an increased occurrence was reported for
both occupational groups (odds ratio [OR] 1.875, 95% CI 1.438-2.445 and OR 2.892,
95% CI 2.079-4.023 for farmers and forestry workers, respectively). In summary,
our analyses stress the actual occurrence of hantaviruses in selected
occupational groups. Improved understanding of appropriate preventive measures,
as well as further studies on hantavirus infection rates in reservoir host
species (rodents, shrews, and bats) and virus transmission to humans, is needed
to prevent future outbreaks.
