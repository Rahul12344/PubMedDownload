BACKGROUND: More than 90% of the adult population globally is chronically
infected by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is well established that EBV is
associated with a number of malignancies, and advances in knowledge of
EBV-related malignancies are being made every year. Several studies have analysed
the global epidemiology and geographic distribution of EBV-related cancers.
However, most have only described a single cancer type or subtype in isolation or
limited their study to the three or four most common EBV-related cancers. This
review will present an overview on the spectrum of cancers linked to EBV based on
observations of associations and proportions in the published literature while
also using these observations to estimate the incidence and mortality burden of
some of these cancers.
METHOD: We have reviewed the literature on defining features, distribution and
outcomes across six cancers with a relatively large EBV-related case burden:
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Gastric carcinoma (GC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL),
Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Extranodal
NK/T-cell lymphoma, Nasal type (ENKTL-NT). We retrieved published region-specific
EBV-related case proportions for NPC, GC, HL and BL and performed meta-analyses
on pooled region-specific studies of EBV-related case proportions for DLBCL and
ENKTL-NT. We match these pooled proportions with their respective regional
incidence and mortality numbers retrieved from a publicly available cancer
database. Additionally, we also reviewed the literature on several other less
common EBV-related cancers to summarize their key characteristics herein.
CONCLUSION: We estimated that EBV-related cases from these six cancers accounted 
for 239,700-357,900 new cases and 137,900-208,700 deaths in 2020. This review
highlights the significant global impact of EBV-related cancers and extends the
spectrum of disease that could benefit from an EBV-specific therapeutic.
