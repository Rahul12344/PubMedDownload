Influenza virus has a continuous and extensive impact on human health around the 
world. Its extensive animal host characteristics and highly variable
characteristics lead to continuous antigen drift and change of susceptible
populations, causing repeated global influenza epidemics, and also affecting the 
protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccine. This research in a number of
subtypes of influenza a virus, for example, from the antigenic drift of
antigenicity, influence of the seasonal influenza vaccine strains and popular
strain compatibility, broad-spectrum flu vaccine development train of thought,
etc. summarizes the progress of relevant research, to deepen the understanding of
the influenza virus antigenic evolution, provide reference for flu vaccine
development in the future.
