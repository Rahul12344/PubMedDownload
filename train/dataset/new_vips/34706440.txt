BACKGROUND: Unpaid caregivers of adults play critical roles in health care
systems by providing care to older adults and those with chronic conditions. The 
COVID-19 pandemic has heightened caregiving needs, forcing some into caregiving
roles and disrupting others. We sought to estimate the prevalence of and identify
factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and
suicidal ideation amongst unpaid caregivers of adults versus non-caregivers.
METHODS: During June 24-30, 2020, surveys were administered to U.S. adults. Quota
sampling and survey weighting were implemented to improve sample
representativeness of age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Of 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed surveys and
5,011 (92.6%) met screening criteria and were analyzed, including 1,362 (27.2%)
caregivers. Caregivers had higher adverse mental health symptom prevalences than 
non-caregivers, including suicidal ideation (33.4% vs 3.7%, p < 0.0001). Symptoms
were more common among caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged
18-24 vs ≥65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI 1.95-3.88, p < 0.0001) and with moderate and
high vs low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65-3.23; 2.81, 2.00-3.94;
both p < 0.0001).
LIMITATIONS: Self-report data may be subject to recall, response, and social
desirability biases; unpaid caregivers were self-identified; child caregiving
roles were not assessed; and internet-based survey samples might not fully
represent the U.S.
POPULATION:
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers experienced disproportionately high levels of adverse
mental health symptoms. Younger caregivers and those with higher caregiving
intensity were disproportionately affected. Increased visibility of and access to
mental health care resources are urgently needed to address mental health
challenges of caregiving.
