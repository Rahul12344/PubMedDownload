Intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa is highly problematic in immunocompromised
patients such as those in intensive care units in hospitals. Phage therapy is an 
attractive alternative or supplementary therapy to antibiotics as it not only
kills multidrug-resistant bacteria, but also minimises the disruption of gut
microflora. Solid oral dosage forms (i.e., tablets) have the potential to
effectively deliver viable phages to the gastrointestinal tract, but formulation 
studies have been scarce. In this study, Pseudomonas-targeting phage PEV20 was
used as a model to produce tablets suitable for oral delivery by utilising
industry-scale tablet compression and tablet coating machines. Phage tablets were
produced by (i) spray drying of phages, (ii) direct compression of the phage
powders into tablets, and then (iii) tablet coating. The resulting phage tablets 
had negligible phage titre reduction throughout the process and passed the
British Pharmacopeia tests, including friability, weight variation,
disintegration and dissolution of the tablets as well as weight gain and
disintegration (in 0.1 M HCl and pH 7.4 phosphate buffer) of coated tablets. The 
developed formulation method can be utilised to produce tablets containing other 
phages and phage cocktails that are effective against enteric bacterial
infections.
