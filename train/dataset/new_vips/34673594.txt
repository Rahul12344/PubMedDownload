Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease that has affected the Indian
population very badly with more than 8.46 million cases and > 0.125 million
deaths.
Aim: Primary objective of the study is to establish the role of hematological,
coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers in early identification of clinically
severe covid-19 cases.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted from July 2020 to August 2020 at 
a dedicated COVID-19 referral hospital in central India. Only RT-PCR confirmed
COVID-19 positive 300 cases admitted in the hospital were included in this study.
Based on the clinical assessment, patients were categorised as mild, moderate,
and severe groups as per ICMR guidelines. Blood samples of all cases were tested 
for haematological, coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers and mean values were 
compared among the three groups of patients.
Results: 46% patients belonged to >60 years of age group. Hematological
parameters like total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, Neutrophil:
Lymphocyte ratio, Platelet: Lymphocyte ratio significantly increased with
lymphocytopenia (P=0.001). Coagulation profile(D-dimer and PT) and inflammatory
biomarkers like CRP, LDH, ferritin, procalcitonin and NT- Pro BNP, all were
significantly increased with severity of patients(p=0.001). ROC plotted for all
the parameters between severe v/s non-severe cases showed that CRP, LDH and
D-dimer had a good discriminative precision with AUC >0.8.
Conclusion: We suggest that biochemical markers like CRP, LDH and D-dimer can be 
used as a screening tool to differentiate severe patients from non-severe
patients of Covid-19 disease in order to identify severe disease at early stage
for optimal utilization of resources & reducing further morbidity & mortality.
