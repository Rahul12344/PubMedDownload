The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficient virus (HIV-1) is
known to cluster on the viral membrane surface to attach to target cells and
cause membrane fusion for HIV-1 infection. However, the molecular structural
mechanisms that drive Env clustering remain opaque. Here, we use solid-state NMR 
spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate
nanometer-scale clustering of the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and
transmembrane domain (TMD) of gp41, the fusion protein component of Env. Using
19F solid-state NMR experiments of mixed fluorinated peptides, we show that
MPER-TMD trimers form clusters with interdigitated MPER helices in
cholesterol-containing membranes. Inter-trimer 19F-19F cross peaks, which are
indicative of spatial contacts within ∼2 nm, are observed in cholesterol-rich
virus-mimetic membranes but are suppressed in cholesterol-free model membranes.
Water-peptide and lipid-peptide cross peaks in 2D 1H-19F correlation spectra
indicate that the MPER is well embedded in model phosphocholine membranes but is 
more exposed to the surface of the virus-mimetic membrane. These experimental
results are reproduced in coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations, which suggest that the effects of cholesterol on gp41 clustering is 
likely via indirect modulation of the MPER orientation. Cholesterol binding to
the helix-turn-helix region of the MPER-TMD causes a parallel orientation of the 
MPER with the membrane surface, thus allowing MPERs of neighboring trimers to
interact with each other to cause clustering. These solid-state NMR data and
molecular dynamics simulations suggest that MPER and cholesterol cooperatively
govern the clustering of gp41 trimers during virus-cell membrane fusion.
