The membranes of endosomes, phagosomes and macropinosomes can become damaged by
the physical properties of internalized cargo, by active pathogenic invasion or
by cellular processes, including endocytic maturation. Loss of membrane integrity
is often deleterious and is, therefore, prevented by mitigation and repair
mechanisms. However, it can occasionally be beneficial and actively induced by
cells. Here, we summarize the mechanisms by which cells, in particular
phagocytes, try to prevent membrane damage and how, when this fails, they repair 
or destroy damaged endocytic organelles. We also detail how one type of
phagocyte, the dendritic cell, can deliberately trigger localized damage to
endocytic organelles to allow for major histocompatibility complex class I
presentation of exogenous antigens and initiation of CD8+ T-cell responses to
viruses and tumours. Our review highlights mechanisms for the regulation of
endocytic organelle membrane integrity at the intersection of cell biology and
immunology that could be co-opted for improving vaccination and intracellular
drug delivery.
