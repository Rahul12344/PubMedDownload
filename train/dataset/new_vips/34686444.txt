BACKGROUND: The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS
-Corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a major concern the world over. Serological
surveillance is an important tool to assess the spread of infection in the
community. This study attempted to assess the prevalence of antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Delhi, India during the pre-vaccination period.
METHODS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2-2 IgG antibodies were determined in blood
donors reporting to the Department of Transfusion medicine at a tertiary care
hepatobiliary center, in India from September to October 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies against spike subunit 1 protein were measured using the enhanced
chemiluminescence method.
RESULTS: A total of 1066 blood donors were screened. The overall seropositivity
for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 27.57 % (294/1066). The highest seropositivity 
was seen in the age group 26-35 years, 46.6 % (137/492), followed by 18-25 years,
28.2 % (83/260), 36-45 years, 19.4 % (57/244), and more than 45 years, 5.8 %
(17/70). The seropositivity in the donors who had donated blood previously was
26.1 % (189/723). There was no statistically significant difference amongst
seroprevalence in the blood groups, AB blood group (32.6 %, 95 % CI 23.02-43.3), 
group B (27.2 %, 95 % CI 22.8-32.09 %), group A (27.1 %, 95 % CI 21.8-32.9 %),
and group O (27.02 %, 95 % CI 22.3-32.1 %) (p 0.539).
CONCLUSIONS: There was significantly higher seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in the voluntary healthy blood donors indicating community spread and 
large number of asymptomatic cases in Delhi. Higher seroprevalence in younger
adults indicated increased exposure to the virus and lack of COVID appropriate
behaviour.
