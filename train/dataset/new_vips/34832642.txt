BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment, although highly
efficacious for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, may not
completely reconstitute the HCV-mediated dysregulated immune system, especially
in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the impact of HCV eradication following DAA
therapy on the immune system and liver disease improvement through comparative
monitoring of 10 HCV mono-infected and 10 HCV/HIV co-infected patients under
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Early and late longitudinal phenotypic
changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets, T-cell activation,
differentiation and exhaustion, as well as inflammatory biomarkers, indoleamine
2-3 dioxygenase (IDO) activity, and liver stiffness, APRI and FIB-4 scores were
assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were obtained at baseline (T0), week 1 (T1), week 
2 (T2), week 12 (T3, end of treatment, EOT), and month 9 (T4, end of follow-up,
36 weeks post EOT).
RESULTS: All patients achieved a sustained virological response (SVR 12) after
DAA treatment. Overall, changes of the T-cell immune phenotypes were greater in
HCV/HIV co-infected than in HCV mono-infected, due to an increase in CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cell percentages and of CD8+ T-cell activation and memory markers, in
particular at the end of follow-up. On the other end, HCV mono-infected showed
changes in the activation profile and in the memory CD4+ T-cell compartment. In
HCV/HIV co-infected, a decrease in the IDO activity by DAA treatment was
observed; conversely, in HCV mono-infected, it resulted unmodified. Regarding
inflammatory mediators, viral suppression was associated with a reduction in
IP-10 levels, while interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7, interferon (IFN)-β, and
interferon (IFN)-γ levels were downregulated during therapy and increased post
therapy. A decrease in liver stiffness, APRI, and FIB-4 scores was also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, although patients achieved HCV eradication,
the immune activation state in both HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected
patients remains elevated for a long time after the end of DAA therapy, despite
an improvement of liver-specific outcomes, meanwhile highlighting the distinct
immunophenotypic and inflammatory biomarker profile between the groups of
patients.
