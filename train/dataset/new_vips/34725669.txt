This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote physical
exercise (PE) to prevent mobility loss among pre-disabled older adults during the
COVID-19 lockdowns. Participants followed a 12-week PE remote program in Zoom©
supervised groups (Web-Ex group, n=11) or phone-supervised individual
booklet-based home-program (Booklet group, n=33). The total rate of adherence was
82.5% in the Web-Ex group and 85.8% in the Booklet group. The level of
satisfaction was « a lot » for 60% of the participants in the Web-ex group and
for 37.9% of those included in the Booklet group. Respectively 10% and 31% of the
participants rated the difficulty as « low » in the web-ex and Booklet groups.
Remote physical exercise using a web technology or booklets at home with regular 
and personalized follow-up during the lockdown was feasible and acceptable among 
pre-disabled seniors.
