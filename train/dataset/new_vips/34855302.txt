Gene editing enables scientists to make precise changes to the genome of an
organism using the cell's own ability to repair damaged DNA using a supplied DNA 
template. In recent years, gene editing has been applied clinically in the
treatment of diseases such as cancer. Gene editing has been used in a type of
immunotherapy, known as CAR-T, to restore the body's ability to find and kill
specific cancer cells. For this therapy, viruses are often used to supply the
cell with the DNA template used for creating the edit in the target DNA. However,
the use of viruses in this context is laborious and costly. Developing non-viral 
methods for delivery of DNA templates for gene editing would circumvent these
problems, but current methods can have toxic effects on cells and result in low
editing efficiency. In a new article published in this issue, Yang et al.
describe a novel method for viral-independent delivery of naked DNA and its
incorporation into the genome for engineering cells for CAR-T therapy.
