Understanding the evolution of viral pathogens is critical to being able to
define how viruses emerge within different landscapes. Host susceptibility, which
is spread between different species and is a contributing factor to the
subsequent epidemiology of a disease, is defined by virus detection and
subsequent characterization. Peste des petits ruminants virus is a plague of
small ruminant species that is a considerable burden to the development of
sustainable agriculture across Africa and much of Asia. The virus has also had a 
significant impact on populations of endangered species in recent years,
highlighting its significance as a pathogen of high concern across different
regions of the globe. Here, we have re-evaluated the molecular evolution of this 
virus using novel genetic data to try and further resolve the molecular
epidemiology of this disease. Viral isolates are genetically characterized into
four lineages (I-IV), and the historic origin of these lineages is of
considerable interest to the molecular evolution of the virus. Our re-evaluation 
of viral emergence using novel genome sequences has demonstrated that lineages I,
II and IV likely originated in West Africa, in Senegal (I) and Nigeria (II and
IV). Lineage III sequences predicted emergence in either East Africa (Ethiopia)
or in the Arabian Peninsula (Oman and/or the United Arab Emirates), with a
paucity of data precluding a more refined interpretation. Continual refinements
of evolutionary emergence, following the generation of new data, is key to both
understanding viral evolution from a historic perspective and informing on the
ongoing genetic emergence of this virus.
