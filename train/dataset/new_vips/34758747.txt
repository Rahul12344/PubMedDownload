BACKGROUND: Although the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) research consortium (AARC) ACLF score is
easy to use in patients with hepatitis b virus-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF), serum
lactate is not routinely tested in primary hospitals, and its value may be
affected by some interference factors. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is
used to assess the status of bacterial infection (BI) or outcomes in patients
with various diseases. We developed an NLR-based AARC ACLF score and compared it 
with the existing model.
METHODS: A total of 494 HBV-ACLF patients, enrolled in four tertiary academic
hospitals in China with 90-day follow-up, were analysed. Prognostic performance
of baseline NLR and lactate were compared between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic
subgroups via the receiver operating curve and Kaplan-Meier analyses. A modified 
AARC ACLF (mAARC ACLF) score using NLR as a replacement for lactate was developed
(n = 290) and validated (n = 204).
RESULTS: There were significantly higher baseline values of NLR in non-survivors,
patients with admission BI, and those with higher grades of ACLF compared with
the control groups. Compared with lactate, NLR better reflected BI status in the 
cirrhotic subgroup, and was more significantly correlated with CTP, MELD,
MELD-Na, and the AARC score. NLR was an independent predictor of 90-day
mortality, and was categorized into three risk grades (< 3.10, 3.10-4.78, and
> 4.78) with 90-day cumulative mortalities of 8%, 21.2%, and 77.5% in the
derivation cohort, respectively. The mAARC ACLF score, using the three grades of 
NLR instead of corresponding levels of lactate, was superior to the other four
scores in predicting 90-day mortality in the derivation (AUROC 0.906, 95% CI
0.872-0.940, average P < 0.001) and validation cohorts (AUROC 0.913, 95% CI
0.876-0.950, average P < 0.01), with a considerable performance in predicting
28-day mortality in the two cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic value of NLR is superior to that of lactate in
predicting short-term mortality risk in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients with
HBV-ACLF. NLR can be incorporated into the AARC ACLF scoring system for improving
its prognostic accuracy and facilitating the management guidance in patients with
HBV-ACLF in primary hospitals.
