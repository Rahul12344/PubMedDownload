To minimize immune responses against infected cells, HIV-1 has evolved different 
mechanisms to limit the surface expression of its envelope glycoproteins (Env).
Recent observations suggest that the binding of certain broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the 'closed' conformation of Env induces its
internalization. On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAbs) that
preferentially target Env in its 'open' conformation, remain bound to Env on the 
cell surface for longer periods of time. In this study, we attempt to better
understand the underlying mechanisms behind the differential rates of
antibody-mediated Env internalization. We demonstrate that 'forcing' open Env
using CD4 mimetics allows for nNAb binding and results in similar rates of Env
internalization as those observed upon the bNAb binding. Moreover, we can
identify distinct populations of Env that are differentially targeted by Abs that
mediate faster rates of internalization, suggesting that the mechanism of
antibody-induced Env internalization partially depends on the localization of Env
on the cell surface.
