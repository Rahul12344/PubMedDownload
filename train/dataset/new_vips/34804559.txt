The SARS-CoV-2 virus disproportionately causes serious illness and death in older
individuals. In order to have the greatest impact in decreasing the human toll
caused by the virus, antiviral treatment should be targeted to older patients.
For this, we need a better understanding of the differences in viral dynamics
between SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger and older adults. In this study, we use
previously published averaged viral titre measurements from the nose and throat
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged cynomolgus macaques to parametrize a
viral kinetics model. We find that all viral kinetics parameters differ between
young and aged macaques in the nasal passages, but that there are fewer
differences in parameter estimates from the throat. We further use our
parametrized model to study the antiviral treatment of young and aged animals,
finding that early antiviral treatment is more likely to lead to a lengthening of
the infection in aged animals, but not in young animals.
