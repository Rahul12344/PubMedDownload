OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for rapid novel
diagnostic strategies. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) may allow
for the detection of pathogens that can be missed in targeted assays. The goal of
this study was to assess the performance of nanopore-based Sequence-Independent
Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) for the detection and characterization of
SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We performed mNGS on clinical samples and designed a diagnostic
classifier that corrects for barcode crosstalk between specimens. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed on genome assemblies.
RESULTS: Our assay yielded 100% specificity overall and 95.2% sensitivity for
specimens with a RT-PCR cycle threshold value less than 30. We assembled 10
complete, and one near-complete genomes from 20 specimens that were classified as
positive by mNGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 10/11 specimens from
British Columbia had a closest relative to another British Columbian specimen. We
found 100% concordance between phylogenetic lineage assignment and Variant of
Concern (VOC) PCR results. Our assay was able to distinguish between the Alpha
and Gamma variants, which was not possible with the current standard VOC PCR
being used in British Columbia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports future work examining the broader feasibility of
nanopore mNGS as a diagnostic strategy for the detection and characterization of 
viral pathogens.
