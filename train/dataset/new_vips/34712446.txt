BACKGROUND Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections rank among the most
frequent infectious diseases with a rising worldwide burden. However, their
epidemiology and risk factors are understudied in many regions, including Iran.
METHODS This study was conducted as part of the Pars Cohort Study (PCS) in
Valashahr district, Fars province (2012-2014). Participants received venipuncture
for HBsAg and HCV antibody, followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing. 
All infected people and their comparison groups completed a risk assessment
questionnaire. RESULTS Overall, 9,269 people participated in the study; the
majority were women and of Fars ethnicity. Prevalence of HBsAg and HCV antibody
was 2.3% (n = 215) and 0.3% (n = 26), from whom 23% (n = 47) and 13% (n = 3) had 
indications for treatment, respectively. During follow-up, among HBsAg-positive
individuals who were not on treatment, 62% tested negative for HBsAg, and in 2%
HBV DNA had risen to treatment levels. Risk factors for HBV infection were
illiteracy [OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.1, 10.3], and Turk ethnicity compared to Fars
[OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.3]. History of blood transfusion [OR = 2.00, 95% CI =
1.1, 3.5] and history of drug use [OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.1, 7.4] were associated 
with HCV infection, after adjustment. CONCLUSION Further epidemiological studies 
are needed to identify at-risk populations in different regions. Preventive
interventions, including educational programs and transfusion safety strategies, 
are crucial for reducing the hepatitis burden.
