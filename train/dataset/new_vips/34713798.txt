BackgroundDetailed information on symptom duration and temporal course of
patients with mild COVID-19 was scarce at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic.AimWe aimed to determine the longitudinal course of clinical symptoms in
non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Berlin, Germany.MethodsBetween March and
May 2020, 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases in home isolation notified in Berlin,
Germany, were sampled using total population sampling. Data on 25 symptoms were
collected during telephone consultations (a maximum of four consultations) with
each patient. We collected information on prevalence and duration of symptoms for
each day of the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and for day 30 and 60 after
symptom onset.ResultsMedian age was 35 years (range 18-74), 57% (58/102) were
female, and 37% (38/102) reported having comorbidities. During the first 2 weeks,
most common symptoms were malaise (94%, 92/98), headache (71%, 70/98), and
rhinitis (69%, 68/98). Malaise was present for a median of 11 days (IQR 7-14
days) with 35% (34/98) of cases still reporting malaise on day 14. Headache and
muscle pain mostly occurred during the first week, whereas dysosmia and dysgeusia
mostly occurred during the second week. Symptoms persisted in 41% (39/95) and 20%
(18/88) of patients on day 30 and 60, respectively.ConclusionOur study shows that
a significant proportion of non-hospitalised COVID-19 cases endured symptoms for 
at least 2 months. Further research is needed to assess the frequency of
long-term adverse health effects in non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients.
