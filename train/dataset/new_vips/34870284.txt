Background: In early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl
in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern
Europe.
Methods: Between April 21st and 27th 2020, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study 
targeting the full population of Ischgl (n = 1867), of which 79% could be
included (n = 1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the 
study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. 
A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined 
seroprevalence on virus transmission.
Results: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 39.8-44.7).
Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI
21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2-47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356-0.682,
p < 0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have
had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over
the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded,
corresponding to an infection fatality rate of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03-0.91). Only 8
(0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during
this study.
Conclusions: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local 
seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than 
in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly
infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occurred due to the dual
impact from the non-pharmacological interventions and a high immunization of the 
Ischgl population.
