BACKGROUND: Aged-care facilities (ACF's) provide unique challenges when
implementing infection control methods for respiratory outbreaks such as
COVID-19. Research on this highly vulnerable setting is lacking and there was no 
national reporting data of COVID-19 cases in ACFs in Australia early in the
pandemic. We aimed to estimate the burden of aged-care worker (ACW) infections
and outbreaks of COVID-19 in Australian aged-care.
METHODS: A line list of publicly available aged-care related COVID-19 reported
cases from January 25 to June 10, 2020 was created and was enhanced by matching
data extracted from media reports of aged-care related COVID-19 relevant
outbreaks and reports. Rate ratios (RR) were used to predict risk of infection in
ACW and aged-care residents, and were calculated independently, by comparing
overall cases to ACW and aged-care residents' cases.
RESULTS: A total of 14 ACFs with COVID-19 cases were recorded by June 2020
nationwide, with a high case fatality rate (CFR) of 50% (n = 34) and 100% (n = 3)
seen in two ACFs. Analysis on the resident risk found that the COVID-19 risk is
1.27 times higher (unadjusted RR 1.27 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to1.61;
P = 0.047) as compared with the risk of infection in the general population. In
over 60% of cases identified in ACFs, the source of infection in the index case
was unknown. A total of 28 deaths associated within ACFs were reported,
accounting for 54.9% of total deaths in New South Wales and 26.9% of total deaths
in Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: This high-risk population requires additional prevention and control
measures, such as routine testing of all staff and patients regardless of
symptoms. Prompt isolation and quarantine as soon as a case is confirmed within a
facility is essential.
