Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 editing holds promise to treat 
many diseases. The immune response to bacterial-derived Cas9 has been speculated 
as a hurdle for AAV-CRISPR therapy. However, immunological consequences of
AAV-mediated Cas9 expression have thus far not been thoroughly investigated in
large mammals. We evaluate Cas9-specific immune responses in canine models of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) following intramuscular and intravenous
AAV-CRISPR therapy. Treatment results initially in robust dystrophin restoration 
in affected dogs but also induces muscle inflammation, and Cas9-specific humoral 
and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that are not prevented by the
muscle-specific promoter and transient prednisolone immune suppression. In normal
dogs, AAV-mediated Cas9 expression induces similar, though milder, immune
responses. In contrast, other therapeutic (micro-dystrophin and SERCA2a) and
reporter (alkaline phosphatase, AP) vectors result in persistent expression
without inducing muscle inflammation. Our results suggest Cas9 immunity may
represent a critical barrier for AAV-CRISPR therapy in large mammals.
