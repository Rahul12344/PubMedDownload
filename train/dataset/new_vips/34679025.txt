Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a kind of Fusarium toxin that can cause a variety of
toxic effects. Oxidative stress and DNA damage play a critical role in the
toxicity of DON. However, previous studies focused more on acute toxicity in
vivo/vitro models and lacked subchronic toxicity study in vivo. The potentially
harmful effect of DON given at doses comparable to the daily human consumption in
target organs, especially the liver, which is the main detoxification organ of
DON, is also still not fully understood. Otherwise, Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has
also reduced cell damage under the DON condition according to our previous study.
Therefore, we used a rodent model that mimicked daily human exposure to DON and
further explored its mechanism of toxic effects on liver tissue and Hepa 1-6 cell
line. We also used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-modified HO-1 expressing by tail 
vein injection and constructed lentivirus-Hepa 1-6 cell line for mimicking HO-1
protective ability under the DON condition. The main results showed that both 30 
d and 90 d exposures of DON could cause low-grade inflammatory infiltration
around hepatic centrilobular veins. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) increased during DON exposure, indicating
oxidation stress and DNA damage. Significantly, AAV-mediated liver-specific
overexpression of HO-1 reduced DON-induced liver damage and indirectly protected 
the abilities of antioxidant enzyme/DNA damage repair system, while AAV-mediated 
silence of HO-1 produced the opposite effect. In addition, we found that
overexpression of HO-1 could enhance autophagy and combined it with an
antioxidant enzyme/DNA damage repair system to inhibit DON-induced hepatocyte
damage. Altogether, these data suggest that HO-1 reduces the oxidative stress and
DNA damage caused by DON sub-chronic exposure through maintaining DNA repair,
antioxidant activity, as well as autophagy.
