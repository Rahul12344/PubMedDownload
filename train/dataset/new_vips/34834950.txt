Vaccines to prevent the impact of SARS-CoV-2 are now available, including for
patients with autoimmune diseases. However, there is no information about how
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment could impact the cellular and humoral 
immune responses. This study evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular
responses after vaccination with a two-dose schedule in a Crohn's disease patient
treated with Infliximab (10 mg/kg); we included comparisons with a monozygotic
twin. The results showed that the Crohn's disease's twin (twin 2) had no antibody
detection and reduced activation of CD4+ T cell responses, unlike the twin
without the autoimmune disease (twin 1). Twin 2 developed antigen-specific
central memory CD8+ T-cells and IFNγ production after the second dose of COVID-19
vaccination, similar to twin 1. These findings elucidated the role of T-cell
immunity after COVID-19 immunization on IBD patients despite the lack of antibody
production. Finally, our observation supports the consensus recommendation for
IBD patients to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
