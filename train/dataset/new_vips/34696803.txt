INTRODUCTION: Antigen-based lateral flow devices (LFDs) offer the potential of
widespread rapid testing. The scientific literature has primarily focused on
mathematical modelling of their use and test performance characteristics. For
these tests to be implemented successfully, an understanding of the real-world
contextual factors that allow them to be integrated into the workplace is vital. 
To address this gap in knowledge, we aimed to explore staff's experiences of
integrating LFDs into routine practice for visitors and staff testing with a view
to understand implementation facilitators and barriers.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis.
RESULTS: We identified two main themes and five subthemes. The main themes
included: visitor-related testing factors and staff-related testing factors.
Subthemes included: restoring a sense of normality, visitor-related testing
challenges, staff-related testing challenges, and pre-pilot antecedent factors.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the real-world implementation of LFDs to 
test visitors and staff faces significant challenges as a result of several
contextual factors negatively affecting the work practice and environment. More
comprehensive studies are needed to identify and inform effective implementation 
strategies to ensure that LFDs can be adopted in an agile way that better
supports an already exhausted and morally depleted workforce.
