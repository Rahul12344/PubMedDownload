Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a highly contagious disease of young
salmonid fish and is one of the most severe economic diseases in aquaculture. In 
Turkey, an increase in infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) outbreaks in
freshwater rainbow trout have been reported in recent years. This study aimed to 
analyze the VP2 gene from recent IPNV isolates from Turkey to determine whether
there are epidemiological links between IPNV isolates from rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss; 62) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax; 1), wild turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus; 1) and the environment in order to investigate potential
wild and farmed fish interactions. In this study, 62 Turkish IPNV isolates
collected over 10 years (2005-2014) from rainbow trout, sea bass and turbot were 
genotypically characterized. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that Turkish
IPNV isolates are closely related to strains from Denmark, Iran and Spain and
that all Turkish IPNV isolates belong to genogroup V, serotype A2 (Sp strain).
Furthermore, low genetic diversity was found among the Turkish isolates
(identity, 95.5%-100% nucleotides and 97.8%-100% amino acids). The result of the 
analysis of the amino acid residues found at positions 217, 221 and 247 (proline,
threonine and alanine, respectively) could be associated with virulence.
