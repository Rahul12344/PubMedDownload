Sirtuins (SIRTs) are well-known histone deacetylases that are capable of
modulating various cellular processes in numerous diseases, including the
infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is one of the primary pathogenic
drivers of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mounting evidence
reveals that HBV can alter the expression levels of all SIRT proteins. In turn,
all SIRTs regulate HBV replication via a cascade of molecular mechanisms.
Furthermore, several studies suggest that targeting SIRTs using suitable drugs is
a potential treatment strategy for HBV infection. Here, we discuss the molecular 
mechanisms associated with SIRT-mediated upregulation of viral propagation and
the recent advances in SIRT-targeted therapy as potential therapeutic modalities 
against HBV infection.
