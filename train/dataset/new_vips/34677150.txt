Cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients leads to acute
lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, shock, 
and thrombosis thus contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Several 
agents like steroids, ascorbic acid, vitamins (C, D, E), glutathione,
N-acetylcysteine have been used and several studies are underway to identify its 
efficacy in addressing undesirable effects due to COVID-19 illness. Among several
experimental modalities based on expert opinion and anecdotal data, melatonin is 
one molecule that appears promising. Owing to its anti-inflammatory,
anti-oxidant, and immunomodulatory properties, melatonin can be an important
agent used as a component of multimodal analgesia in COVID-19 patients, suspected
patients, and patients with exposure to positive patients undergoing emergency or
urgent surgeries. Further research is required to know the optimal time of
initiation, dose, and duration of melatonin as an adjunct.
