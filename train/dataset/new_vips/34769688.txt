This study investigates travel behavior and psychosocial factors that influence
it during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional study, using an online
survey, we examined changes in travel behavior and preferences after lifting
travel restrictions, and how these changes were influenced by exposure to
COVID-19, COVID-19 travel-related risk and severity, personality, fear of travel,
coping, and self-efficacy appraisals in the Romanian population. Our results
showed that participants traveled less in the pandemic year than the year
before-especially group and foreign travel-yet more participants reported
individual traveling in their home county during the pandemic period. Distinct
types of exposure to COVID-19 risk, as well as cognitive and affective factors,
were related to travel behavior and preferences. However, fun-seeking personality
was the only major predictor of travel intention, while fear of travel was the
only predictor of travel avoidance. Instead, people traveled more cautiously when
they perceived more risk of infection at the destination, and had higher levels
of fear of travel, but also a high sense of efficacy in controlling the infection
and problem-solving capacity. The results suggest that specific information about
COVID-19, coping mechanisms, fear of travel, and neuropsychological personality
traits may affect travel behavior in the pandemic period.
