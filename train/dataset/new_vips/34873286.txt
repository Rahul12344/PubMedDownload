The lungs are the primary target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with severe hypoxia being the cause of death in the
most critical cases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is extremely
heterogeneous in terms of severity, clinical phenotype and, importantly, global
distribution. Although the majority of affected patients recover from the acute
infection, many continue to suffer from late sequelae affecting various organs,
including the lungs. The role of the pulmonary vascular system during the acute
and chronic stages of COVID-19 has not been adequately studied. A thorough
understanding of the origins and dynamic behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and
the potential causes of heterogeneity in COVID-19 is essential for anticipating
and treating the disease, in both the acute and the chronic stages, including the
development of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Both COVID-19 and chronic
pulmonary hypertension have assumed global dimensions, with potential complex
interactions. In this Review, we present an update on the origins and behaviour
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and discuss the potential causes of the heterogeneity of 
COVID-19. In addition, we summarize the pathobiology of COVID-19, with an
emphasis on the role of the pulmonary vasculature, both in the acute stage and in
terms of the potential for developing chronic pulmonary hypertension. We hope
that the information presented in this Review will help in the development of
strategies for the prevention and treatment of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.
