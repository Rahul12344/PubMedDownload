This study is based on a psychoanalytically inspired psychological investigation 
of two pregnant women with COVID-19 at different stages of pregnancy in the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology A at the Charles Nicolle Hospital. Our
study was conducted between 2020 and 2021, until deliveries. Two young Tunisian
women aged 28 and 30 years were tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy.
They suffered from emotional shock. In this study, we discuss the different
points of collision between life and death by describing, in detail, the
experiences of these two women during their confinement.
