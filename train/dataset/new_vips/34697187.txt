BACKGROUND/AIM: COVID-19 may lead to progressive respiratory failure as a
consequence of alveolar damage, resulting in death. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate cytogenetic damage in oral cells of COVID-19 patients by micronucleus
assay.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 11 COVID-19 patients aged 40.7±9.3 years (5 men 
and 6 women) were included in this study. For the control group, a total of 15
participants not infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were included. The mean age was
41.6±6.2 years (5 men and 10 women).
RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in
micronucleated buccal mucosa cells of COVID-19 patients. In addittion, a
statistically significant increase in karyolysis and karrhyorexis (p<0.05) was
observed in COVID-19 patients compared to control.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 virus can induce mutagenesis and cytotoxicity in oral
cells.
