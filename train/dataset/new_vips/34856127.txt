In this issue of Cell, two studies apply powerful structural approaches to probe 
the modes of interaction between a broadly neutralizing antibody and a conserved 
epitope found on four dengue virus serotypes and Zika virus. These findings offer
new insights into how a broadly neutralizing antibody surmounts antigenic and
conformational variation.
