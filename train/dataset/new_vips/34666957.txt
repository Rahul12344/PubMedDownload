PURPOSE: Recent studies have documented worrisome levels of hesitancy and
resistance to the COVID-19 vaccine, including within the adolescent population.
In this study, we examined attitudinal (perceived severity of COVID-19,
vaccine-related concerns) and interpersonal (parent and peer norms) antecedents
of adolescents' intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
METHODS: Participants were 916 adolescents (aged 12-17 years) from across the
United States (47.3% male) representing diverse ethnic and socioeconomic
backgrounds (26% African-American, 22% Hispanic/Latinx, 35% white, 7% Asian
American). They completed a survey on their experiences and attitudes surrounding
COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.
RESULTS: Parent and peer norms were distinct predictors of adolescent willingness
to receive the vaccine. These norms were associated with vaccine intentions
directly and indirectly through adolescents' beliefs about the vaccine's safety, 
efficacy, and necessity. Parent norms in particular displayed large effect sizes 
and explained considerable variance in adolescents' vaccine intentions.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents and friends-who figure as adolescents' most salient
interpersonal relationships-are key leveraging points in promoting adolescents'
uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Norm interventions and family-based interventions
may be successful in this regard.
