OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the impact of Covid-19 in a critical area and analyze the
changes in the daily activities in a General Surgery Unit of a tertiary
Covid-Hospital.
METHODS: We report and compared all the surgical procedures performed between two
periods (March and April 2019 and March and April 2020) at General Surgery
Department of Parma University Hospital, a tertiary Covid-Hospital.
RESULTS: Between March and April 2019, a total of 232 surgical procedures were
performed. Between March and April 2020 only 61 surgical procedures were
performed. In 2019 84 patients underwent surgery for cancer and 171 underwent
surgery for benign diseases. In 2020 only 37 patients underwent surgery for
oncological reasons and 24 underwent surgery for benign diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: During pandemic Covid-19 the access to health services was limited
and poor. Limited access to health services and the fear of Covid-19 infection
can explain the lower number of elective surgical procedures for cancer in 2020
compared to the same period in the 2019.
