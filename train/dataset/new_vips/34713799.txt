BackgroundUp-to-date seroprevalence estimates are critical to describe the
SARS-CoV-2 immune landscape and to guide public health decisions.AimWe estimate
seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 15 months into the COVID-19 pandemic
and 6 months into the vaccination campaign.MethodsWe conducted a population-based
cross-sectional serosurvey between 1 June and 7 July 2021, recruiting
participants from age- and sex-stratified random samples of the general
population. We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the
spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins using the Roche Elecsys immunoassays. We
estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence following vaccination
and/or infection (anti-S antibodies), or infection only (anti-N
antibodies).ResultsAmong 3,355 individuals (54.1% women; 20.8% aged < 18 years
and 13.4% aged ≥ 65 years), 2,161 (64.4%) had anti-S antibodies and 906 (27.0%)
had anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence was 66.1% (95% credible interval 
(CrI): 64.1-68.0). We estimated that 29.9% (95% Crl: 28.0-31.9) of the population
developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies via
vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates differed markedly across age groups, being 
lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8%; 95% Crl: 15.5-26.7) and highest
among older adults aged ≥ 75 years (93.1%; 95% Crl: 89.6-96.0). Seroprevalence of
antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among
participants with higher educational level.ConclusionMost of the population has
developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, despite most teenagers and children
remaining vulnerable to infection. As the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spreads and
vaccination rates stagnate, efforts are needed to address vaccine hesitancy,
particularly among younger individuals and to minimise spread among children.
