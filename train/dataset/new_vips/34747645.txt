At the time of this writing, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to
be a global threat, disrupting usual processes, and protocols for delivering
health care around the globe. There have been significant regional and national
differences in the scope and timing of these disruptions. Many hospitals were
forced to temporarily halt elective neurointerventional procedures with the first
wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, in order to prioritize allocation of 
resources for acutely ill patients and also to minimize coronavirus disease 2019 
transmission risks to non-acute patients, their families, and health care
workers. This temporary moratorium on elective neurointerventional procedures is 
generally credited with helping to "flatten the curve" and direct scarce
resources to more acutely ill patients; however, there have been reports of some 
delaying seeking medical care when it was in fact urgent, and other reports of
patients having elective treatment delayed with the result of morbidity and
mortality. Many regions have resumed elective neurointerventional procedures,
only to now watch coronavirus disease 2019 positivity rates again climbing as
winter of 2020 approaches. A new wave is now forecast which may have larger
volumes of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients than the earlier
wave(s) and may also coincide with a wave of patients hospitalized with seasonal 
influenza. This paper discusses relevant and practical elements of cessation and 
safe resumption of nonemergent neurointerventional services in the setting of a
pandemic.
