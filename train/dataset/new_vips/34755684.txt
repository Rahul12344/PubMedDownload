Under pandemic conditions, it is important to communicate local infection risks
to better enable the general population to adjust their behaviors accordingly. In
Japan, our team operates a popular non-government and not-for-profit dashboard
project - "Japan LIVE Dashboard" - which allows the public to easily grasp the
evolution of the pandemic on the internet. We presented the Dashboard design
concept with a generic framework integrating socio-technical theories, disease
epidemiology and related contexts, and evidence-based approaches. Through
synthesizing multiple types of reliable and real-time local data sources from all
prefectures across the country, the Dashboard allows the public access to
user-friendly and intuitive disease visualization in real time and has gained an 
extensive online followership. To date, it has attracted c.30 million visits (98%
domestic access) testifying to the reputation it has acquired as a user-friendly 
portal for understanding the progression of the pandemic. Designed as an
open-source solution, the Dashboard can also be adopted by other countries as
well as made applicable for other emerging outbreaks in the future. Furthermore, 
the conceptual design framework may prove applicable into other ehealth scaled
for global pandemics.
