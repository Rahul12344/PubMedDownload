Here we report on the synthesis and characterization of three new N-modified
analogues of hemorphin-4 with rhodamine B. Modified with chloroacetyl, chloride
cotton fabric has been dyed and color coordinates of the obtained textile
materials were determined. Antiviral and virucidal activities of both the
peptide-rhodamine B compounds and the dyed textile material were studied. Basic
physicochemical properties (acid-base behavior, solvent influence, kinetics)
related to the elucidation of structural activity of the new modified peptides
based on their steric open/closed ring effect were studied. The obtained results 
lead to the conclusion that in protic solvent with change in pH of the
environment, direct control over the dyeing of textiles can be achieved. Both the
new hybrid peptide compounds and the modification of functionalized textile
materials with these bioactive hemorphins showed virucidal activity against the
human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV-S2) and human adenovirus serotype 5
(HAdV-5) for different time intervals (30 and 60 min) and the most active
compound was Rh-3.
