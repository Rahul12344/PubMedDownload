BACKGROUND: Improved short- and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation have
been achieved over the past decades due to improved immunosuppression. This may
have increased the risk for infections and, particularly, for the viral
infections: cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and polyoma BK virus
(BKV).
METHODS: A retrospective review of viremic CMV, EBV, and BKV infections in
pediatric renal transplant recipients treated and followed by a national referral
center over a 10-year period.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (68% males) received 68 kidney grafts (62% from
living donors) during the study period; the mean follow-up period was
5.2 ± 2.4 years. Twenty-seven viremic episodes were documented (CMV: 13, EBV: 6, 
BKV: 8) in 24 patients (35.2%). The median time (interquartile range) to viremia 
post-transplant was 11 (4-38) months. The viral infection rate was significantly 
higher in the years 2014-2015 than in previous years (61% vs. 29%, p = .017).
Compared to patients who did not develop viremia, patients with viremias were
younger at the time of transplantation, were more likely to receive thymoglobulin
induction pre-transplant and to develop an acute rejection. Multiple logistic
regression modeling identified transplant year and recipient's age as significant
risk factors for viremia. Graft outcome and eGFR at the last follow-up was
similar between patients who did and did not develop viremia.
CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections continue to be a major cause of morbidity in
pediatric kidney transplant recipients. However, with close monitoring and prompt
intervention, patient and renal outcomes remain favorable.
