Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a significant viral
infectious disease that commonly occurs among farmed pigs, leads to considerable 
economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Major vault protein (MVP) is a
host factor that induces type Ⅰ interferon (IFN) production. In this study, we
evaluated the effect of MVP on PRRSV infection in CRL2843CD163 cell lines and
porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Our results showed that MVP expression was
downregulated by PRRSV infection. Adenoviral overexpression of MVP inhibited
PRRSV replication, whereas the siRNA knockdown of MVP promoted PRRSV replication.
In addition, MVP knockdown has an adverse effect on the inhibitive role of MVP
overexpression on PRRSV replication. Moreover, MVP could induce the expression of
type Ⅰ IFNs and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in PRRSV-infected PAMs. Based on
these results, MVP may be a potential molecular target of drugs for the effective
prevention and treatment of PRRSV infection.
