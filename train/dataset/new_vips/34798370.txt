Viruses may evolve to increase the amount of encoded genetic information by means
of overlapping genes, which utilize several reading frames. Such overlapping
genes may be especially impactful for genomes of small size, often serving a
source of novel accessory proteins, some of which play a crucial role in viral
pathogenicity or in promoting the systemic spread of virus. Diverse genome-based 
metrics were proposed to facilitate recognition of overlapping genes that
otherwise may be overlooked during genome annotation. They can detect the
atypical codon bias associated with the overlap (e.g. a statistically significant
reduction in variability at synonymous sites) or other sequence-composition
features peculiar to overlapping genes. In this review, I compare nine
computational methods, discuss their strengths and limitations, and survey how
they were applied to detect candidate overlapping genes in the genome of
SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19 pandemic.
