Bronisława Brandla Fejgin was a Polish-born Jewish female physician. Among
Fejgin's numerous articles in the field of microbiology, her later work was
almost entirely devoted to phage research. Although not equally famous as the
phage pioneers from Western Europe, F.W. Twort and F. d'Herelle, Fejgin's
contribution to phage research deserves proper recognition. Her studies on phages
resulted in the publication of numerous original scientific reports. These
articles, published mostly in French, constitute an important source of
information and expertise on early attempts towards therapeutic use of phages in 
humans. The interwar period marks the most intense years in Bronisława Fejgin's
research activity, brutally interrupted by her death in the Warsaw Ghetto in
1943. Her microbiology contributions have not been analyzed so far. Thus, the aim
of this article is to fill the existing gap in the history of microbiology and
phage therapy.
