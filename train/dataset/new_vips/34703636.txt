Objective: The aim of this study was to create a decision tree model with machine
learning to predict the outcomes of COVID-19 cases from data publicly available
in the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) COVID Data Drop.
Methods: The study design was a cross-sectional records review of the DOH COVID
Data Drop for 25 August 2020. Resolved cases that had either recovered or died
were used as the final data set. Machine learning processes were used to
generate, train and validate a decision tree model.
Results: A list of 132 939 resolved COVID-19 cases was used. The notification
rates and case fatality rates were higher among males (145.67 per 100 000 and
2.46%, respectively). Most COVID-19 cases were clustered among people of working 
age, and older cases had higher case fatality rates. The majority of cases were
from the National Capital Region (590.20 per 100 000), and the highest case
fatality rate (5.83%) was observed in Region VII. The decision tree model
prioritized age and history of hospital admission as predictors of mortality. The
model had high accuracy (81.42%), sensitivity (81.65%), specificity (81.41%) and 
area under the curve (0.876) but a poor F-score (16.74%).
Discussion: The model predicted higher case fatality rates among older people.
For cases aged > 51 years, a history of hospital admission increased the
probability of COVID-19-related death. We recommend that more comprehensive
primary COVID-19 data sets be used to create more robust prognostic models.
