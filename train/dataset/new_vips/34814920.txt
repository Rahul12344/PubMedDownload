BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus with a high
mutation rate. Importantly, several currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are
associated with loss of efficacy for both vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.
METHODS: We analyzed the binding activity of six highly potent antibodies to the 
spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessed their neutralizing abilities with
pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluate efficacy of antibody
cocktail in Delta SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster models as prophylactic and
post-infection treatments.
RESULTS: The tested RBD-chAbs, except RBD-chAb-25, maintained binding ability to 
spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, only RBD-chAb-45 and -51
retained neutralizing activities; RBD-chAb-1, -15, -25 and -28 exhibited
diminished neutralization for all SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, several cocktails
of our antibodies showed low IC50 values (3.35-27.06 ng/ml) against the
SARS-CoV-2 variant pseudoviruses including United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7
(Alpha), South Africa variant B.1.351 (Beta), Brazil variant P1 (Gamma),
California variant B.1.429 (Epsilon), New York variant B.1.526 (Iota), and India 
variants, B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). RBD-chAb-45, and -51 showed
PRNT50 values 4.93-37.54 ng/ml when used as single treatments or in combination
with RBD-chAb-15 or -28, according to plaque assays with authentic Alpha, Gamma
and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, the antibody cocktail of RBD-chAb-15 
and -45 exhibited potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects in Delta SARS-CoV-2
variant-infected hamsters.
CONCLUSIONS: The cocktail of RBD-chAbs exhibited potent neutralizing activities
against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These antibody cocktails are highly promising
candidate tools for controlling new SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta.
