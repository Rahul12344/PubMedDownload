The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 95% of adults worldwide and is
associated with various malignant tumors and immune diseases, imparting a huge
disease burden on the human population. Available EBV vaccines are imminent.
Prophylactic vaccines can effectively prevent the spread of infection, whereas
therapeutic vaccines mainly stimulate cell-mediated immunity and kill infected
cells, thus curbing the development of malignant tumors. Nevertheless, there are 
still no approved EBV vaccines after decades of effort. The complexity of the EBV
life cycle, the lack of appropriate animal models, and the limited reports on
adjuvant selection and immune responses are gravely impeding progress in EBV
vaccines. The soluble gp350 vaccine could reduce the incidence of infectious
mononucleosis (IM), which seemed to offer hope, but could not prevent EBV
infection. Continuous research and vaccine trials provide deep insights into the 
structural biology of viruses, the designs for immunogenicity, and the evolving
vaccine platforms. Moreover, the new vaccine candidates are expected to achieve
further success via combined immunization to elicit both a dual protection of B
cells and epithelial cells, and sustainable immunization against infected cells
at several phases of infection.
