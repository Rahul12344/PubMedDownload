The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a zoonotic
infection, is responsible for COVID-19 pandemic and also is known as a public
health concern. However, so far, the origin of the causative virus and its
intermediate hosts is yet to be fully determined. SARS-CoV-2 contains nearly
30,000 letters of RNA that allows the virus to infect cells and hijack them to
make new viruses. On the other hand, among 14 detected mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein that provide advantages to virus for transmission and
evasion form treatment, the D614G mutation (substitution of aspartic acid [D]
with glycine [G] in codon 614 was particular which could provide the facilitation
of the transmission of the virus and virulence. To date, in contrary to the
global effort to come up with various aspects of SARS-CoV-2, there are still
great pitfalls in the knowledge of this disease and many angles remain unclear.
That's why, the monitoring and periodical investigation of this emerging
infection in an epidemiological study seems to be essential. The present study
characterizes the current epidemiological status (i.e., possible transmission
route, mortality and morbidity risk, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and clinical
feature) of the SARS-CoV-2 in the world during these pandemic.
