Internet media may exacerbate public confusion and anxiety about COVID-19. New
media health literacy (NMHL) is considered to play a protective role against
health-related misinformation from the media for individuals to maintain their
health. The current study aims to examine the relationship among Taiwanese
adults' NMHL, health status, anxiety, and prevention behaviors during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online
survey, and 342 responses were included in the analysis. The survey tools include
Health Status, COVID-19-Related New Media Health Literacy, COVID-19 Anxiety, and 
COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors. The research showed that both functional and
critical prosuming literacy had positive relationships with health status.
Functional consumption literacy had a weak negative correlation with COVID-19
anxiety. Furthermore, critical consumption literacy had a positive relationship
with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Therefore, individuals' health, anxiety, and 
prevention behaviors are affected by different aspects of COVID-19-related new
media health literacy. Compared to their consuming media literacy, Taiwanese
adults have insufficient prosuming media literacy in regard to COVID-19 health
issues.
