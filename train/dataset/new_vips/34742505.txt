Nurses consistently stand out in extraordinary ways especially during a global
crisis, recently confirmed in the current Covid-19 pandemic. What is opportune
this time is the call for clarity around what nurses do and what society can
expect from them. Nurses, as members of a global profession, need a platform to
build a contemporary practice life. This paper proposes the model: The Exemplary 
Practice Life of the Nurse. It provides a framework to explicate the essence of
the role of the nurse. The model posits four inter-related essential components
or pillars that ground a nurse's behavior and commitment: professionalism,
leadership, scholarly practice, and stewardship. This uncomplicated,
straightforward model is universally applicable for nurses to apply in whatever
roles they hold and at any point in their careers. The use of a holistic model,
as a guide across a full career trajectory, supports the nurse's ability to
prioritize individual pillars while understanding the inter-relationship and
influence among the four pillars. The authors pose assumptions that form the
basis of the registered nurse role and provide the foundation for the exemplary
practice life of the nurse. They make recommendations to nurses, the profession, 
the workplace, the academy, and the community.
