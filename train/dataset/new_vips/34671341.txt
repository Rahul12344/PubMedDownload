Severe COVID-19 is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS)-like hyperinflammation and endothelial dysfunction, that can lead to
respiratory and multi organ failure and death. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD)
and pulmonary fibrosis confer an increased risk for severe disease, while a
subset of COVID-19-related ARDS surviving patients will develop a
fibroproliferative response that can persist post hospitalization. Autotaxin
(ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D, largely responsible for the
extracellular production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a pleiotropic signaling 
lysophospholipid with multiple effects in pulmonary and immune cells. In this
review, we discuss the similarities of COVID-19, ARDS and ILDs, and suggest ATX
as a possible pathologic link and a potential common therapeutic target.
