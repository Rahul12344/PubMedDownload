BACKGROUND: In Antarctica, summer sunlight enables phototrophic microorganisms to
drive primary production, thereby "feeding" ecosystems to enable their
persistence through the long, dark winter months. In Ace Lake, a stratified
marine-derived system in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica, a Chlorobium
species of green sulphur bacteria (GSB) is the dominant phototroph, although its 
seasonal abundance changes more than 100-fold. Here, we analysed 413 Gb of
Antarctic metagenome data including 59 Chlorobium metagenome-assembled genomes
(MAGs) from Ace Lake and nearby stratified marine basins to determine how genome 
variation and population structure across a 7-year period impacted ecosystem
function.
RESULTS: A single species, Candidatus Chlorobium antarcticum (most similar to
Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM265) prevails in all three aquatic systems and
harbours very little genomic variation (≥ 99% average nucleotide identity). A
notable feature of variation that did exist related to the genomic capacity to
biosynthesize cobalamin. The abundance of phylotypes with this capacity changed
seasonally ~ 2-fold, consistent with the population balancing the value of a
bolstered photosynthetic capacity in summer against an energetic cost in winter. 
The very high GSB concentration (> 108 cells ml-1 in Ace Lake) and seasonal cycle
of cell lysis likely make Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum a major provider of
cobalamin to the food web. Analysis of Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum viruses
revealed the species to be infected by generalist (rather than specialist)
viruses with a broad host range (e.g., infecting Gammaproteobacteria) that were
present in diverse Antarctic lakes. The marked seasonal decrease in Ca.
Chlorobium antarcticum abundance may restrict specialist viruses from
establishing effective lifecycles, whereas generalist viruses may augment their
proliferation using other hosts.
CONCLUSION: The factors shaping Antarctic microbial communities are gradually
being defined. In addition to the cold, the annual variation in sunlight hours
dictates which phototrophic species can grow and the extent to which they
contribute to ecosystem processes. The Chlorobium population studied was inferred
to provide cobalamin, in addition to carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur
cycling, as critical ecosystem services. The specific Antarctic environmental
factors and major ecosystem benefits afforded by this GSB likely explain why such
a coherent population structure has developed in this Chlorobium species. Video
