Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus experience high rates of influenza
virus infection and complications. We compared the magnitude and duration of
serologic response to trivalent influenza vaccine in adults aged 50-80 with and
without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serologic response to influenza vaccination was
similar in both groups: greater fold-increases in antibody titer occurred among
participants with lower pre-vaccination antibody titers. Waning of antibody
titers was not influenced by diabetes status.
