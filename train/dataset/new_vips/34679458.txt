The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2020-2021. COVID-19 is
becoming one of the most fatal pandemics in history and brings a huge challenge
to the global healthcare system. Opportune detection, confinement, and early
treatment of infected cases present the first step in combating COVID-19.
Diagnosis via viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) is frequently
employed and considered the standard procedure. However, with an increasing urge 
for point-of-care tests, rapid and cheaper immunoassays are widely utilized, such
as lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), which can be used for rapid, early, and
large-scale detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this narrative review, the
principle and technique of LFIA applied in COVID-19 antigen and antibody
detection are introduced. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the
commercial LFIA tests are outlined and compared. Generally, LFIA antigen tests
for SARS-CoV-2 are less sensitive than viral NAATs, the "gold standard" for
clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. However, antigen tests can be used for rapid and
mass testing in high-risk congregate housing to quickly identify people with
COVID-19, implementing infection prevention and control measures, thus preventing
transmission. LFIA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, IgM and/or IgG, known as
serology tests, are used for identification if a person has previously been
exposed to the virus or vaccine immunization. Notably, advanced techniques, such 
as LFT-based CRISPR-Cas9 and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), have
added new dimensions to the COVID-19 diagnosis and are also discussed in this
review.
