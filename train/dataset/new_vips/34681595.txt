We report a lymphoma patient with profound B-cell deficiency after chemotherapy
combined with anti-CD20 antibody successfully treated with remdesivir and
convalescent plasma for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral clearance was
likely attributed to the robust expansion and activation of TCR Vβ2 CD8+
cytotoxic T cells and CD16 + CD56- NK cells. This is the first presentation of
TCR-specific T cell oligoclonal response in COVID-19. Our study suggests that
B-cell depleted patients may effectively respond to anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment
when NK and antigen-specific Tc cell response is induced.
