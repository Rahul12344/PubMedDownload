Epizootic haemorragic disease (EHD) is an important disease of white-tailed deer 
and can cause a bluetongue-like illness in cattle. A definitive diagnosis of EHD 
relies on molecular assays such as real-time RT-qPCR or conventional PCR. Reverse
transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a
cost-effective, specific, and sensitive technique that provides an alternative to
RT-qPCR. We designed two sets of specific primers targeting segment-9 of the EHD 
virus genome to enable the detection of western and eastern topotypes, and
evaluated their performance in singleplex and multiplex formats using cell
culture isolates (n = 43), field specimens (n = 20), and a proficiency panel (n =
10). The limit of detection of the eastern and western RT-LAMP assays was
estimated as ~24.36 CT and as ~29.37 CT in relation to real-time RT-qPCR,
respectively, indicating a greater sensitivity of the western topotype singleplex
RT-LAMP. The sensitivity of the western topotype RT-LAMP assay, relative to the
RT-qPCR assay, was 72.2%, indicating that it could be theoretically used to
detect viraemic cervines and bovines. For the first time, an RT-LAMP assay was
developed for the rapid detection of the EHD virus that could be used as either a
field test or high throughput screening tool in established laboratories to
control the spread of EHD.
