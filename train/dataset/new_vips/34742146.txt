Clostridium perfringens is one of the most important foodborne pathogens in
developed countries. It causes severe food poisoning outbreaks worldwide, along
with mortality and economic losses. Recently, bacteriophages have been
investigated as an alternative tool to control pathogenic bacteria in the food
industry. In this study, 19 Clostridium perfringens and 6 Clostridium perfringens
bacteriophages were isolated from chicken meat. According to host range and
stability tests, bacteriophage CPQ1 showed high thermostability and the broadest 
host range. The electron micrograph image of this bacteriophage suggested that it
belongs to the Picovirinae subfamily of the Podoviridae family. Nucleotide
sequence analysis of the genomic DNA indicated the absence of any antibiotic
resistance, toxin, or virulence genes. In broth, CPQ1 showed strong lytic
activity with a low MOI of 1, decreasing the OD600 of Clostridium perfringens
cell suspension from 0.2 to 0.02 at 37 °C in 2 h. In pasteurized milk and chicken
meat, CPQ1 with an MOI of 10 also caused a significant decrease in viable counts 
of Clostridium perfringens compared to the bacteriophageless control at both
24 °C and 37 °C. This is the first report on the application of bacteriophage to 
control Clostridium perfringens in foods.
