The treatment focus for multiple myeloma (MM) has recently pivoted towards immune
modulating strategies, with T-cell redirection therapies currently at the
forefront of drug development. Yet, despite this revolution in treatment, MM
remains without a sustainable cure. At the same time, tremendous advancement has 
been made in recombinant and gene editing techniques for oncolytic viruses (OV), 
which have increased their tumor specificity, improved safety, and enhanced the
oncolytic and immunostimulatory potential. These breakthrough developments in
oncolytic virotherapy have opened new avenues for OVs to be used in combination
with other immune-based therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen
receptor T-cells (CAR-T) and bispecific T-cell engagers. In this review, the
authors place the spotlight on systemic oncolytic virotherapy as an adaptable
immunotherapeutic for MM, highlight the unique mechanism of OVs in activating the
immune-suppressive marrow microenvironment, and lastly showcase the OV platforms 
and the promising combination strategies in the pipeline for MM.
