In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020), SARS-CoV-2 was detected 
in farmed minks and genomic sequencing was performed on mink farms and farm
personnel. Here, we describe the outbreak and use sequence data with Bayesian
phylodynamic methods to explore SARS-CoV-2 transmission in minks and humans on
farms. High number of farm infections (68/126) in minks and farm workers (>50% of
farms) were detected, with limited community spread. Three of five initial
introductions of SARS-CoV-2 led to subsequent spread between mink farms until
November 2020. Viruses belonging to the largest cluster acquired an amino acid
substitution in the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein (position 486), 
evolved faster and spread longer and more widely. Movement of people and distance
between farms were statistically significant predictors of virus dispersal
between farms. Our study provides novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 transmission
between mink farms and highlights the importance of combining genetic information
with epidemiological information when investigating outbreaks at the animal-human
interface.
