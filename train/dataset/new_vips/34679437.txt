MicroRNA is a small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) involved in gene silencing and
regulating post-transcriptional gene expression. miRNAs play an essential role in
the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases, viral diseases and cancer. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an 
aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), arising from different stages of B-cell 
differentiation whose pathogenesis involves miRNAs. Various viral and non-viral
vectors are used as a delivery vehicle for introducing specific miRNA inside the 
cell. Adenoviruses are linear, double-stranded DNA viruses with 35 kb genome size
and are extensively used in gene therapy. Meanwhile, Adeno-associated viruses
accommodate up to 4.8 kb foreign genetic material and are favorable for
transferring miRNA due to small size of miRNA. The genetic material is integrated
into the DNA of the host cell by retroviruses so that only dividing cells are
infected and stable expression of miRNA is achieved. Over the years, remarkable
progress was made to understand DLBCL biology using advanced genomics and
epigenomics technologies enabling oncologists to uncover multiple genetic
mutations in DLBCL patients. These genetic mutations are involved in epigenetic
modification, ability to escape immunosurveillance, impaired BCL6 and NF-κβ
signaling pathways and blocking terminal differentiation. These pathways have
since been identified and used as therapeutic targets for the treatment of DLBCL.
Recently miRNAs were also identified to act either as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors in DLBCL pathology by altering the expression levels of some of the
known DLBCL related oncogenes. i.e., miR-155, miR-17-92 and miR-21 act as
oncogenes by altering the expression levels of MYC, SHIP and FOXO1, respectively,
conversely; miR-34a, mir-144 and miR-181a act as tumor suppressors by altering
the expression levels of SIRT1, BCL6 and CARD11, respectively. Hundreds of miRNAs
have already been identified as biomarkers in the prognosis and diagnosis of
DLBCL because of their significant roles in DLBCL pathogenesis. In conclusion,
miRNAs in addition to their role as biomarkers of prognosis and diagnosis could
also serve as potential therapeutic targets for treating DLBCL.
