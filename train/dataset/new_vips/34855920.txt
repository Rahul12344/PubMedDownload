BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs have been effective in the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Limited data are
available on safety, tolerability, and efficacy in American Indian or Alaska
Native people. We aim to evaluate the treatment outcomes of sofosbuvir- based
regimens for treatment of HCV in a real life setting in Alaska Native/American
Indian (AN/AI) people.
METHODS: AN/AI patients within the Alaska Tribal Health System with confirmed
positive anti-HCV and HCV RNA, who were 18 years of age and older were included
in the study. Pretreatment baseline patient characteristics, treatment efficacy
based on sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after treatment completion, 
and adverse effects were assessed. The following treatments were given according 
to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Disease
Society of America (AASLD/IDSA) HCV Guidance: ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir
plus weight-based ribavirin, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.
RESULTS: We included 501 patients with a mean age of 54.3 (range 21.3-78.3) in
the study. Overall SVR was achieved in 95.2% of patients who received one of the 
three DAA regimens. For those with cirrhosis, overall SVR was 92.8% and for those
with genotype 3 91.1% achieved SVR. The most common symptom experienced during
treatment was headache. Joint pain was found to decrease during treatment. One
person discontinued sofosbuvir plus ribavirin due to myocardial infarction and
one discontinued sofosbuvir/velpatasvir due to urticaria.
CONCLUSIONS: In the real-world setting, sofosbuvir-based treatment is safe,
effective, and well tolerated in AN/AI patients. Sustained virologic response was
high regardless of HCV genotype or cirrhosis status.
