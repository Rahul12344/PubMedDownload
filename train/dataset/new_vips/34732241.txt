BACKGROUND: In Europe, Aedes albopictus is an important vector of chikungunya
virus and Dirofilaria nematodes and has been involved in local autochthonous
circulation of dengue and Zika viruses. Due to the ongoing spread, targeted field
surveillance at potential points of entry of invasive Aedes mosquitoes was
initiated by the Republic of Moldova in 2020 as part of the transboundary
"Invasive Aedes Mosquitoes COST-Action project."
METHODS: In 2020, ovitraps were positioned at each of three locations: the border
crossing to Romania in Leuşeni (Hancesti region), Chişinӑu International Airport 
and Chişinӑu Botanical Garden.
RESULTS: A total of 188 Aedes spp. eggs were collected at the Chişinӑu
International Airport between August and September 2020. Twenty-three adults
reared in the laboratory were identified morphologically as Ae. albopictus
(Skuse, 1895), and 12 selected specimens were confirmed by molecular barcoding of
the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene region. In addition, one adult Ae.
albopictus female at the same site was caught with a manual aspirator.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented report of Ae. albopictus in the
Republic of Moldova. The presence of immature and adult stages indicates the
local reproduction of the species in the country. Therefore, it is crucial to
extend and strengthen surveillance of the invasive Aedes mosquitoes to prevent
Ae. albopictus and other exotic mosquito species from becoming established in the
Republic of Moldova.
