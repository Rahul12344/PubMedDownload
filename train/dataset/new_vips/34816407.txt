Despite vaccination, pancreas disease (PD) caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV)
has been the economically most important virus disease in salmon farming in
Ireland, Scotland, and Norway. A vaccine based on DNA plasmid has been authorized
to be used in Norwegian aquaculture since 2018. DNA vaccination of plasmids
expressed subcellular viral proteins have been shown its particular protective
effect against SAV3 that surface expression of the E2 protein with the whole
viral protein construct, yielding a more effective vaccine. The chapter describes
methods to design and test the sublocalization of expressed viral protein and the
performance evaluation of vaccines against SAV3 infection in Atlantic salmon.
