BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has not only increased mortality but has also
negatively affected mental health among populations across the world.
Furthermore, individuals are experiencing uncertainty about their current and
future situation because of the pandemic. Therefore, the present study
investigated the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship
between fear of COVID-19 and procrastination among a sample of Turkish university
students.
METHODS: Between October and November 2020, 450 university students (291 females 
and 159 males aged 17 to 24 years) from three state universities in Turkey
completed an online survey. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling
methods were employed to examine a model for understanding the general
procrastination during COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The results of the correlation analysis indicated that the fear of
COVID-19 was positively correlated with both intolerance of uncertainty (r = .26,
p < .001) and procrastination (r = .23, p < .001). The mediation analysis also
showed that intolerance of uncertainty had a significant mediating role in the
relationship between fear of COVID-19 and procrastination (β = .11, p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Reducing the fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty is
likely to contribute to reducing individuals' procrastination behaviors during
the pandemic.
