Recognising metastatic gastrointestinal and pancreatobiliary tumours to
gynaecological sites may be challenging, as primary Müllerian tumours can
demonstrate similar histological features. Endocervical adenocarcinomas can be of
gastric and intestinal types, endometrial lesions may show gastrointestinal
phenotype, and finally, mucinous tumours with secondary involvement of the
ovaries may mimic primary neoplasms. The aim of this review is to address
selected neoplastic entities of the gynaecological tract with gastric and
intestinal differentiation and provide helpful clinical and pathological
parameters for the diagnosis. A brief overview of metastatic tumours originating 
from the gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary tracts is also provided,
including the most common pathological features.
