Worldwide, countless deaths have been caused by the coronavirus disease 2019. In 
addition to the virus variants, an increasing number of fatal fungal infections
have been reported, which further exacerbates the scenario. Therefore, the
development of porous surfaces with both antiviral and antimicrobial capacities
is of urgent need. Here, a cost-effective, nontoxic, and metal-free strategy is
reported for the surface engineering of laser-induced graphene (LIG). The authors
covalently engineer the surface potential of the LIG from -14 to ≈+35 mV (LIG+ ),
enabling both high-efficiency antimicrobial and antiviral performance under mild 
conditions. Specifically, several candidate microorganisms of different types,
including Escherichia coli, Streptomyces tenebrarius, and Candida albicans, are
almost completely inactivated after 10-min solar irradiation. LIG+ also exhibits 
a strong antiviral effect against human coronaviruses: 99% HCoV-OC43 and 100%
HCoV-229E inactivation are achieved after 20-min treatment. Such enhancement may 
also be observed against other types of pathogens that are heat-sensitive and
oppositely charged. Besides, the covalent modification strategy alleviates the
leaching problem, and the low cytotoxicity of LIG+ makes it advantageous. This
study highlights the synergy of surface potential and photothermal effect in the 
inactivation of pathogens and it provides a direction for designing porous
materials for airborne disease removal and water disinfection.
