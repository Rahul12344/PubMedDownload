The trucking industry is the backbone of domestic supply chains. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, road transportation has been essential to guarantee the
supply of basic goods to confined urban areas. However, the connectivity of the
trucking network can also act as an efficient virus spreader. This paper applies 
network science to uncover the characteristics of the trucking network in one
major Latin American country -Colombia- and provides evidence on freight
networks' ability to spread contagious diseases spatially. Network metrics,
official COVID-19 records at the municipality level, and a zero-inflated negative
binomial model are used to test the association between network topology and
confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results suggest that: (i) the number of COVID-19 cases 
in a municipality is linked to its level and type of network centrality; and (ii)
being a port-city and a primary economic hub in the trucking network is
associated with a higher probability of contracting earlier a pandemic. Based on 
these results, a risk-based approach is proposed to help policymakers implement
containment measures.
