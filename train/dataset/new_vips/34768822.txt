The feeding behavior in fish is a complex activity that relies on the ability of 
the brain to integrate multiple signals to produce appropriate responses in terms
of food intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic activity. Upon stress cues
including viral infection or mediators such as the proinflammatory cytokines,
prostaglandins, and cortisol, both Pomc and Npy/Agrp neurons from the
hypothalamus are stimulated, thus triggering a response that controls both energy
storage and expenditure. However, how appetite modulators or neuro-immune cues
link pathogenesis and energy homeostasis in fish remains poorly understood. Here,
we provide the first evidence of a molecular linkage between inflammation and
food intake in Salmon salar. We show that in vivo viral challenge with infectious
pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) impacts food consumption by activating anorexic 
genes such as mc4r, crf, and pomcb and 5-HT in the brain of S. salar. At the
molecular level, viral infection induces an overall reduction in lipid content in
the liver, favoring the production of AA and EPA associated with the increment of
elovl2 gene. In addition, infection upregulates leptin signaling and inhibits
insulin signaling. These changes are accompanied by a robust inflammatory
response represented by the increment of Il-1b, Il-6, Tnfa, and Pge2 as well as
an increased cortisol level in vivo. Thus, we propose a model in which
hypothalamic neurons respond to inflammatory cytokines and stress-related
molecules and interact with appetite induction/inhibition. These findings provide
evidence of crosstalk between pathogenesis-driven inflammation and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axes in stress-induced food intake behavior
in fish.
