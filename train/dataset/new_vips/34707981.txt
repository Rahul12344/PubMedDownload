The 5-year Resilient and Responsive Health Systems (RRHS)-Liberia Initiative,
funded by PEPFAR via HRSA, launched in 2017 and was designed to support the
implementation of Liberia's National Health Workforce Program as a means to
improving HIV-related health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic, arrived in Liberia 
just five years after Ebola and during RRHS-Liberia's fourth year, impacted
educational programs and threatened the project's continued work. This paper
presents the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic posed to the RRHS partners, as
well as adaptations they made to maintain progress towards project goals: 1)
contributing to Liberia's 95-95-95 HIV targets via direct service delivery, and
2) building a resilient and responsive health workforce in Liberia via
instruction and training. Direct health service impacts included decreased
patient volumes and understaffing; adaptations included development of and
trainings on safety protocols, provision of telehealth services, and community
health worker involvement. Instruction and training impacts included suspension
of in-person teaching and learning; adaptations included utilization of multiple 
online learning and virtual conferencing tools, and increasing clinical didactics
in lieu of bedside mentorship. The RRHS team recommends that these adaptations be
continued with significant investment in technology, IT support, and training, as
well as close coordination among partner institutions. Ultimately, the RRHS
Liberia consortium and its partners made significant strides in response to
ensuring ongoing education during the pandemic, an experience that will inform
continued service delivery, teaching, and learning in Liberia.
