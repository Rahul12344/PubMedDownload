Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), also known as glycyrrhizin, is a triterpene glycoside
isolated from plants of Glycyrrhiza species (licorice). GA possesses a wide range
of pharmacological and antiviral activities against enveloped viruses including
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Since the S protein (S) mediates 
SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell attachment and cell entry, we assayed the GA
effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection using an S protein-pseudotyped lentivirus
(Lenti-S). GA treatment dose-dependently blocked Lenti-S infection. We showed
that incubation of Lenti-S virus, but not the host cells with GA prior to the
infection, reduced Lenti-S infection, indicating that GA targeted the virus for
infection. Surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that GA interacted with a
recombinant S protein and blocked S protein binding to host cells. Autodocking
analysis revealed that the S protein has several GA-binding pockets including one
at the interaction interface to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) and another at the inner side of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which
might impact the close-to-open conformation change of the S protein required for 
ACE2 interaction. In addition to identifying GA antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2, the study linked GA antiviral activity to its effect on virus cell
binding.
