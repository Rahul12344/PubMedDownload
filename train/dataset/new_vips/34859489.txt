The COVID-19 pandemic struck the world unawares. The virus is now spreading as
never before, despite the initial progress recorded by several countries towards 
kerbing the pandemic. As the pandemic continues to spread across Africa, there is
a need for countries in the continent to re-evaluate, re-strategise, and
re-invigorate their COVID-19 responses and efforts based on lessons from the
first wave, and Nigeria is no exception. Before the second wave was officially
announced by the health authorities on 17 December 2020, there were 78,434
confirmed cases and 1221 deaths reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.6%.
To ensure that Nigeria achieves total pandemic control and reacts better given
the possibility of a second wave, we propose workable recommendations to
strengthen our preparedness and readiness efforts. Here, we argue that lessons
learnt from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic can help Nigeria better react
to the second wave.
