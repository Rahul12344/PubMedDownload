BACKGROUND: Progressive decline of immune response in HIV patients makes them
susceptible to frequent bacterial infections. High usage of antibiotics
influences the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and worsens the clinical
outcomes. In this study, the occurrence of drug-resistant genes in Gram-negative 
bacterial isolates from HIV patients in South India was analyzed.
METHODS: A total of 173 Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) isolates from HIV patients 
were screened for antibiotic susceptibility profile using the Kirby-Bauer
diskdiffusion method. Positivity of drug-resistant genes was analyzed using
polymerase chain reaction method.
RESULTS: In this study, 72.8% of bacterial isolates were obtained from urine
specimens, and Escherichia coli (47.4%) was the predominantly isolated bacterium.
Overall, 87.3% and 83.2% of GNB were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin
antibiotics such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime, respectively, 56.6% were
resistant to cephamycin (cefoxitin) and 43% to carbapenem (imipenem) antibiotics.
Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) production was noted among 79.5% of GNB
isolates, followed by AmpC (57.1%) and Metallo β-lactamases (37.3%). Molecular
analysis revealed that ESBL genes such as blaTEM (94.1%), blaCTX-M (89.2%), and
blaSHV (24.2%) were detected at higher levels among GNB isolates.
Carbapenemase-producing genes such as blaOXA-48 (20%), blaOXA-23 (2.6%), and both
blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51 like genes (2.6%) and AmpC producing genes such as blaCIT
(26.7%), blaDHA (3.6%), and blaACC (1.8%) were detected at low-level.
CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that ESBL producing genes are detected at high 
level among gram-negative bacterial isolates from HIV patients in South India.
