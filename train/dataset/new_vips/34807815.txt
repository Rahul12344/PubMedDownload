Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta variant epidemiology in
Africa is unknown. We found Delta variant was introduced in Benin during
April-May 2021 and became predominant within 2 months, after which a steep
increase in reported coronavirus disease incidence occurred. Benin might require 
increased nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination coverage.
