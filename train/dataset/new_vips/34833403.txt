Background and Objectives: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a major
impact on all aspects of health care. Few up-to-date studies have actually
assessed the impact of COVID-19 on emergency surgeries. The aim of this study was
to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic relating to the emergency
surgery performed, as well as morbidity and mortality rates during the first year
of the pandemic (March 2020-February 2021) and during the control period. In this
period, the first propaedeutic surgery department and the third surgery
department of the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki "AHEPA" in Greece
provided continuous emergency general surgery services. Material and Methods: The
study is in a retrospective cohort and included patients who were admitted to the
Emergency Department and underwent emergency general surgery during the control
period (n = 456), March 2019-February 2020 and during the first year of the
pandemic (n = 223), March 2020-February 2021. Gender, age, type of surgical
operation (morbidity), ICU need, the patient's outcome, and days of
hospitalization were compared. Results: A total of 679 emergency surgeries were
included. Statistically significant differences emerged between the two time
periods in the total number of emergency surgeries performed (p < 0.001). The
most common type of surgery in the control period was associated with soft tissue
infection while, during the pandemic period, the most common type of surgery was 
associated with the hepatobiliary system. In addition, the mortality rates nearly
doubled during the pandemic period (2.2% vs. 4%). Finally, the mean age of our
sample was 50.6 Â± 17.5 and the majority of the participants in both time periods 
were males. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic changed significantly the total
number of emergency general surgeries performed. Mortality rates doubled and
morbidity rates were affected between the control and pandemic periods. Finally, 
age, gender, length of hospitalization, intensive care unit hospitalization, and 
laparoscopy use in patients undergoing emergency surgery during the pandemic were
stable.
