We have read with interest the Letter to the Editor by Drs. Zhuang and Zhong, who
presented the clinical data of 68 patients with Wilson's disease (WD) who were
admitted to the hospital before and during the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, and appreciated their findings on hepatic and some
extrahepatic manifestations. Nevertheless, given the strong impact of the
pandemic on patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, we would have
expected a worsening of the psychiatric and/or neurological impairments in these 
patients. In contrast, according to the authors, these manifestations remained,
somewhat unexpectedly, unchanged. This finding is in contrast with most of the
current literature that highlights not only an increased incidence of mental
health disorders in the general population but also an exacerbation of
neurological and psychiatric symptoms in patients with chronic diseases,
especially in those with pre-existing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as WD.
Although the study was mainly focused on the hepatic features of WD patients
taking anti-copper treatment, a generic and cumulative definition of neurological
and psychiatric manifestations, as in this study, does not allow for further
considerations. Future studies during and after the pandemic are necessary to
clarify the real impact, either direct or indirect, of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the neurological and psychiatric symptoms of WD patients.
