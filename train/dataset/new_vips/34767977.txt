Human rotavirus strains having the unconventional G4P[6] genotype have been
sporadically identified in diarrheic patients in different parts of the world.
However, the whole genome of only one human G4P[6] strain from Africa (central
Africa) has been sequenced and analyzed, and thus the exact origin and
evolutionary pattern of African G4P[6] strains remain to be elucidated. In this
study, we characterized the full genome of an African G4P[6] strain
(RVA/Human-wt/KEN/KCH148/2019/G4P[6]) identified in a stool specimen from a
diarrheic child in Kenya. Full genome analysis of strain KCH148 revealed a unique
Wa-like genogroup constellation: G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T7-E1-H1. NSP3
genotype T7 is commonly found in porcine rotavirus strains. Furthermore,
phylogenetic analysis showed that 10 of the 11 genes of strain KCH148 (VP7, VP4, 
VP6, VP1-VP3, NSP1, and NSP3-NSP5) appeared to be of porcine origin, the
remaining NSP2 gene appearing to be of human origin. Therefore, strain KCH148 was
found to have a porcine rotavirus backbone and thus is likely to be of porcine
origin. Furthermore, strain KCH148 is assumed to have been derived through
interspecies transmission and reassortment events involving porcine and human
rotavirus strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on full
genome-based characterization of a human G4P[6] strain from east Africa. Our
observations demonstrated the diversity of human G4P[6] strains in Africa, and
provide important insights into the origin and evolutionary pattern of zoonotic
G4P[6] strains on the African continent.
