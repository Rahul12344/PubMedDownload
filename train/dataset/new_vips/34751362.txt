There has been an unprecedented global effort by researchers from many
disciplines to obtain and synthesize knowledge to inform policy responses to
SARS-CoV-2. While many major advances have been made in generating and applying
knowledge on a pandemic caused by a novel pathogen, some things could have been
done better, as revealed by the devastating loss of life and economic impact on
livelihoods and communities. We reflect on the context in which the pandemic
emerged, characterized by underinvestment in public health and growing distrust
in institutions, followed by an overview of three broad areas: generation of new 
knowledge, synthesis of existing knowledge, both what was known prior to the
pandemic and what emerged during it, and the challenges of translating knowledge 
into policy. We also consider areas that were largely overlooked in the research 
effort. Across all areas, we aim to draw out relevant lessons for future research
and public health practice.
