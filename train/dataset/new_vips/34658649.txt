Introduction: The data on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in solid-organ
transplant recipients (SOTRs) in Croatia is unknown. The aim of this study was to
analyze the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in Croatian SOTRs.
Materials and methods: From 7 September to 27 November 2020 (beginning of the
second COVID-19 pandemic wave), a cross-sectional screening for COVID-19 was
performed in the adult outpatient liver (LTRs; N = 280) and kidney transplant
recipients (KTRs; N = 232). Serum samples were initially tested for SARS-CoV-2
IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA;
Vircell Microbiologists, Granada, Spain). All positive samples were confirmed
using a virus neutralization test (VNT). Data on risk exposure and COVID-19
related symptoms were collected using a questionnaire.
Results: The transplanted cohort's seroprevalence detected by ELISA and VNT was
20.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Neutralizing (NT) antibodies developed in 15.6% of 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG positive SOTRs. The difference in seropositivity rates 
between LTRs and KTRs was not statistically significant (ELISA 21.1% vs. 19.0%, P
= 0.554; VNT 3.6% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.082). Overall VNT positivity rates were higher 
in patients who reported participation in large community events (5.9% vs. 1.0%; 
P = 0.027) as well as in patients who reported COVID-19 related symptoms in the
past six months. In addition, symptomatic VNT positive patients showed
significantly higher (P = 0.031) NT antibody titers (median 128, interquartile
range (IQR) = 32-128) compared to asymptomatic patients (median 16, IQR = 16-48).
Conclusions: This study showed that 15.6% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA positive
Croatian SOTRs developed NT antibodies indicating protective immunity. Further
studies are needed to determine the dynamic of NT antibodies and COVID-19
immunity duration in immunocompromised populations such as LTRs and KTRs.
