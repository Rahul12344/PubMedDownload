PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Focusing on large multicenter cohorts reported over the last
months, this review aims at summarizing the available evidence by July 2021 on
the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) recipients in terms of epidemiology, clinical features, and
outcome.
RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of COVID-19 in institutional cohorts varied
according to different regions and study periods from 0.4% to 8.3%. Clinical
presentation was overall comparable to other immunocompromised hosts and the
general population. Microbiologically confirmed superinfection occurred in 13-25%
of recipients, with most episodes due to hospital-acquired bacteria and few
reported cases of COVID-19-associated aspergillosis. Prolonged nasopharyngeal
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding has been demonstrated
for as long as 210 days. Mortality rates were similar across studies (14.8-28.4%)
and did not markedly differ from those observed in nontransplant hematological
patients during the first wave. Older age and shorter time from transplantation
were associated with mortality, as well as underlying disease status and amount
of immunosuppression. No outcome differences were found in most studies between
allogeneic and autologous procedures.
SUMMARY: Considerable advances have been achieved in the characterization of
COVID-19 in the HSCT population, although uncertainties remain in the optimal
therapeutic management.
