A case of human infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus containing a
nonstructural gene highly similar to Eurasian avian-like H1Nx swine influenza
virus was detected in Denmark in January 2021. We describe the clinical case and 
report testing results of the genetic and antigenic characterizations of the
virus.
