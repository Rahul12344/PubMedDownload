Deviant Swedes in the Global Covid-19 Media Environment.

During the early COVID-19 pandemic, many countries took compulsory measures to
combating the virus's spread, while Sweden took a more voluntary approach. This
led to polarized reactions in the international media, with some praising it and 
others proclaiming it disastrous. Using the concept of "moral panic" I examine
how actors within the global media environment portrayed Swedes as a deviant
population, using persuasive language, exaggeration, and selective reporting, and
how an amplification of media attention served to solidify the deviant label. I
also argue that Sweden was made deviant partly to justify restrictive measures in
other countries.
