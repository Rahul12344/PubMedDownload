Background: This study aimed to identify enteric and sexually acquired rectal
pathogens, other than chlamydia and gonorrhea, associated with symptomatic
proctitis in men who have sex with men (MSM).
Methods: Anorectal swab samples were obtained from MSM presenting with rectal
symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of proctitis at the Melbourne Sexual Health
Centre between January 2017 and March 2019. Samples that tested positive for
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were excluded. As a comparison
group, anorectal samples were also obtained from MSM not reporting symptoms of
proctitis between November 2018 and February 2019. Samples from both groups were 
tested for 15 viral, bacterial, and protozoal enteric pathogens using polymerase 
chain reaction.
Results: Anorectal samples from 499 men with symptomatic proctitis and 506
asymptomatic men were analyzed. Age, HIV status, and pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) use did not differ between men with proctitis and asymptomatic men.
Treponema pallidum was more common in men with proctitis (risk difference [RD],
3.6%; 95% CI, 2.0%-5.2%). Most men with anorectal T. pallidum presented with
painful anal primary infections. Shigella spp. was more common among men with
proctitis compared with asymptomatic men (RD, 1.8%; 95% CI, 0.1%-3.5%). Most men 
with Shigella did not report diarrhea. Mycoplasma genitalium was more common in
men with proctitis (RD, 4.3%; 95% CI, 1.1%-7.5%). Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1
(RD, 10.1%; 95% CI, 6.8%-13.3%) and HSV-2 (RD, 7.2%; 95% CI, 4.5%-10.0%) were
more common with proctitis.
Conclusions: Testing for T. pallidum, Shigella, and HSV should be considered in
MSM presenting with symptomatic proctitis. These data provide support for M.
genitalium as a significant cause of proctitis. A comprehensive diagnostic
evaluation is required for MSM with proctitis.
