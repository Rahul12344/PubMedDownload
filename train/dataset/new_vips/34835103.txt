Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a serious global health concern because case
fatality rates are approximately 50% due to recent widespread outbreaks in
Africa. Well-defined nonhuman primate (NHP) models for different routes of Ebola 
virus exposure are needed to test the efficacy of candidate countermeasures. In
this natural history study, four rhesus macaques were challenged via aerosol with
a target titer of 1000 plaque-forming units per milliliter of Ebola virus. The
course of disease was split into the following stages for descriptive purposes:
subclinical, clinical, and decompensated. During the subclinical stage, high
levels of venous partial pressure of carbon dioxide led to respiratory acidemia
in three of four of the NHPs, and all developed lymphopenia. During the clinical 
stage, all animals had fever, viremia, and respiratory alkalosis. The
decompensatory stage involved coagulopathy, cytokine storm, and liver and renal
injury. These events were followed by hypotension, elevated lactate, metabolic
acidemia, shock and mortality similar to historic intramuscular challenge
studies. Viral loads in the lungs of aerosol-exposed animals were not distinctly 
different compared to previous intramuscularly challenged studies. Differences in
the aerosol model, compared to intramuscular model, include an extended
subclinical stage, shortened clinical stage, and general decompensated stage.
Therefore, the shortened timeframe for clinical detection of the aerosol-induced 
disease can impair timely therapeutic administration. In summary, this nonhuman
primate model of aerosol-induced EVD characterizes early disease markers and
additional details to enable countermeasure development.
