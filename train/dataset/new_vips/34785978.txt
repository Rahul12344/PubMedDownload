Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, university students struggle with
unexpected changes in their lives, which have adverse effects on their levels of 
anxiety and thriving. Thriving with its two subdimensions, namely vitality and
learning, is a prominent concept for university students due to contributing the 
academic achievement and wellbeing.
Aim: This study aimed to examine the effect of anxiety on thriving levels of
university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: An analytical and cross-sectional study was conducted between December
1, 2020 and January 6, 2021. Data were collected using online surveys with
convenience sampling method. The sample consisted of 322 university students from
a health sciences school of a public university in Turkey.
Findings: The students' anxiety and thriving levels were found to be moderate
with 10.38 ± 5.24 and 3.41 ± 0.85, respectively. The results also indicated that 
anxiety had negative and significant effect on thriving and its subdimensions of 
vitality and learning. In addition, anxiety level differed significantly
according to gender, worried about getting COVID-19 virus and following the
COVID-19 cases on a daily basis while thriving level only differed significantly 
according to the gender.
Discussion: Consistent with previous literature, university students experienced 
high level of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the current
study. The students with high level of anxiety had lower vitality and learning
scores comparing to their peers with low level of anxiety. This result is
crucial, because students with high levels of thriving can cope with stress and
feel themselves better psychologically than others.
Conclusion: This study showed that the students exhibited higher anxiety symptoms
and had lower levels of thriving. Therefore, interventions, psychological
support, and instrumental support are recommended to improve psychological health
of university students.
