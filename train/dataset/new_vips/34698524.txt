This article presents a novel scalable character-based phylogeny algorithm for
dense viral sequencing data called SPHERE (Scalable PHylogEny with REcurrent
mutations). The algorithm is based on an evolutionary model where recurrent
mutations are allowed, but backward mutations are prohibited. The algorithm
creates rooted character-based phylogeny trees, wherein all leaves and internal
nodes are labeled by observed taxa. We show that SPHERE phylogeny is more stable 
than Nextstrain's, and that it accurately infers known transmission links from
the early pandemic. SPHERE is a fast algorithm that can process >200,000
sequences in <2 hours, which offers a compact phylogenetic visualization of
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).
