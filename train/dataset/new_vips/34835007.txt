The genetic diversity of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) poses a challenge to
the successful control of the disease, and it is important to identify the
emergence of different strains in endemic settings. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the sampling of clinically healthy livestock at slaughterhouses
as a strategy for genomic FMDV surveillance. Serum samples (n = 11,875) and
oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples (n = 5045) were collected from clinically
healthy cattle and buffalo on farms in eight provinces in southern and northern
Vietnam (2015-2019) to characterize viral diversity. Outbreak sequences were
collected between 2009 and 2019. In two slaughterhouses in southern Vietnam, 1200
serum and OPF samples were collected from clinically healthy cattle and buffalo
(2017 to 2019) as a pilot study on the use of slaughterhouses as sentinel points 
in surveillance. FMDV VP1 sequences were analyzed using discriminant principal
component analysis and time-scaled phylodynamic trees. Six of seven serotype-O
and -A clusters circulating in southern Vietnam between 2017-2019 were detected
at least once in slaughterhouses, sometimes pre-dating outbreak sequences
associated with the same cluster by 4-6 months. Routine sampling at
slaughterhouses may provide a timely and efficient strategy for genomic
surveillance to identify circulating and emerging FMDV strains.
