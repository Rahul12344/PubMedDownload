Infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) can cause acute and chronic hepatitis in
humans. The HEV genotype 3 can be zoonotically transmitted from animals to
humans, with wild boars representing an important reservoir species. Cell culture
isolation of HEV is generally difficult and mainly described for human isolates
so far. Here, five sera and five liver samples from HEV-RNA-positive wild boar
samples were inoculated onto PLC/PRF/5 cells, incubated for 3 months and
thereafter passaged for additional 6 weeks. As demonstrated by RT-qPCR,
immunofluorescence and immune electron microscopy, virus was successfully
isolated from two liver samples, which originally contained high HEV genome copy 
numbers. Both isolates showed slower growth than the culture-adapted HEV strain
47832c. In contrast to this strain, the isolated strains had no insertions in
their hypervariable genome region. Next generation sequencing using an HEV
sequence-enriched library enabled full genome sequencing. Strain Wb108/17 belongs
to subtype 3f and strain Wb257/17 to a tentative novel subtype recently described
in Italian wild boars. The results indicate that HEV can be successfully isolated
in cell culture from wild boar samples containing high HEV genome copy numbers.
The isolates may be used further to study the zoonotic potential of wild
boar-derived HEV subtypes.
