Lockdowns implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted human
mobility flows around the globe to an unprecedented extent and with economic
consequences which are unevenly distributed across territories, firms and
individuals. Here we study socioeconomic determinants of mobility disruption
during both the lockdown and the recovery phases in Italy. For this purpose, we
analyze a massive data set on Italian mobility from February to October 2020 and 
we combine it with detailed data on pre-existing local socioeconomic features of 
Italian administrative units. Using a set of unsupervised and supervised learning
techniques, we reliably show that the least and the most affected areas
persistently belong to two different clusters. Notably, the former cluster
features significantly higher income per capita and lower income inequality than 
the latter. This distinction persists once the lockdown is lifted. The least
affected areas display a swift (V-shaped) recovery in mobility patterns, while
poorer, most affected areas experience a much slower (U-shaped) recovery: as of
October 2020, their mobility was still significantly lower than pre-lockdown
levels. These results are then detailed and confirmed with a quantile regression 
analysis. Our findings show that economic segregation has, thus, strengthened
during the pandemic.
