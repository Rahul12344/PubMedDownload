Microbial communities in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are known to have
significant impacts on global biogeochemical cycles, but viral influence on
microbial processes in these regions are much less studied. Here we provide
baseline ecological patterns using microscopy and viral metagenomics from the
Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) OMZ region that enhance our understanding
of viruses in these climate-critical systems. While extracellular viral abundance
decreased below the oxycline, viral diversity and lytic infection frequency
remained high within the OMZ, demonstrating that viral influences on microbial
communities were still substantial without the detectable presence of oxygen.
Viral community composition was strongly related to oxygen concentration, with
viral populations in low-oxygen portions of the water column being distinct from 
their surface layer counterparts. However, this divergence was not accompanied by
the expected differences in viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs)
relating to nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms that are known to be performed by
microbial communities in these low-oxygen and anoxic regions. Instead, several
abundant AMGs were identified in the oxycline and OMZ that may modulate host
responses to low-oxygen stress. We hypothesize that this is due to selection for 
viral-encoded genes that influence host survivability rather than modulating host
metabolic reactions within the ETNP OMZ. Together, this study shows that viruses 
are not only diverse throughout the water column in the ETNP, including the OMZ, 
but their infection of microorganisms has the potential to alter host
physiological state within these biogeochemically important regions of the ocean.
