Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health threat in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Phylogenetic analysis of HBV can be helpful 
to study the putative transmission links and patterns of inter-country spread of 
the virus. The objectives of the current study were to analyze the HBV
genotype/sub-genotype (SGT) distribution, reverse transcriptase (RT), and surface
(S) gene mutations and to investigate the domestic transmission of HBV in the
MENA. All HBV molecular sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from
GenBank as of 30 April 2021. Determination of genotypes/SGT, RT, and S mutations 
were based on the Geno2pheno (hbv) 2.0 online tool. For the most prevalent HBV
SGTs, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was conducted to identify the
putative phylogenetic clusters, with approximate Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like
likelihood ratio test values ≥ 0.90, and genetic distance cut-off values ≤ 0.025 
substitutions/site as implemented in Cluster Picker. The total number of HBV
sequences used for genotype/SGT determination was 4352 that represented a total
of 20 MENA countries, with a majority from Iran (n = 2103, 48.3%), Saudi Arabia
(n = 503, 11.6%), Tunisia (n = 395, 9.1%), and Turkey (n = 267, 6.1%). Genotype D
dominated infections in the MENA (86.6%), followed by genotype A (4.1%), with SGT
D1 as the most common in 14 MENA countries and SGT D7 dominance in the Maghreb.
The highest prevalence of antiviral drug resistance was observed against
lamivudine (4.5%) and telbivudine (4.3%). The proportion of domestic phylogenetic
clustering was the highest for SGT D7 (61.9%), followed by SGT D2 (28.2%) and
genotype E (25.7%). The largest fraction of domestic clusters with evidence of
inter-country spread within the MENA was seen in SGT D7 (81.3%). Small networks
(containing 3-14 sequences) dominated among domestic phylogenetic clusters.
Specific patterns of HBV genetic diversity were seen in the MENA with SGT D1
dominance in the Levant, Iran, and Turkey; SGT D7 dominance in the Maghreb; and
extensive diversity in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. A low prevalence of lamivudine,
telbivudine, and entecavir drug resistance was observed in the region, with
almost an absence of resistance to tenofovir and adefovir. Variable proportions
of phylogenetic clustering indicated prominent domestic transmission of SGT D7
(particularly in the Maghreb) and relatively high levels of virus mobility in SGT
D1.
