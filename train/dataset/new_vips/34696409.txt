Lyssaviruses are an important genus of zoonotic viruses which cause the disease
rabies. The United Kingdom is free of classical rabies (RABV). However, bat
rabies due to European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), has been detected in
Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) in Great Britain since 1996, including a
fatal human case in Scotland in 2002. Across Europe, European bat lyssavirus 1
(EBLV-1) is commonly associated with serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus). Despite
the presence of serotine bats across large parts of southern England, EBLV-1 had 
not previously been detected in this population. However, in 2018, EBLV-1 was
detected through passive surveillance in a serotine bat from Dorset, England,
using a combination of fluorescent antibody test, reverse transcription-PCR,
Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemical analysis. Subsequent EBLV-1 positive
serotine bats have been identified in South West England, again through passive
surveillance, during 2018, 2019 and 2020. Here, we confirm details of seven cases
of EBLV-1 and present similarities in genetic sequence indicating that emergence 
of EBLV-1 is likely to be recent, potentially associated with the natural
movement of bats from the near continent.
