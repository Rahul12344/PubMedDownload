Bluetongue (BT) is a midge-borne OIE-notifiable disease of ruminants caused by
the bluetongue virus (BTV). There are at least 29 BTV serotypes as determined by 
serum neutralization tests and genetic analyses of genome segment 2 encoding
serotype immunodominant VP2 protein. Large parts of the world are endemic for
multiple serotypes. The most effective control measure of BT is vaccination.
Conventionally live-attenuated and inactivated BT vaccines are available but have
their specific pros and cons and are not DIVA compatible. The prototype Disabled 
Infectious Single Animal (DISA)/DIVA vaccine based on knockout of NS3/NS3a
protein of live-attenuated BTV, shortly named DISA8, fulfills all criteria for
modern veterinary vaccines of sheep. Recently, DISA8 with an internal in-frame
deletion of 72 amino acid codons in NS3/NS3a showed a similar ideal vaccine
profile in cattle. Here, the DISA/DIVA vaccine platform was applied for other
serotypes, and pentavalent DISA/DIVA vaccine for "European" serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4,
8 was studied in sheep and cattle. Protection was demonstrated for two serotypes,
and neutralization Ab titers indicate protection against other included
serotypes. The DISA/DIVA vaccine platform is flexible in use and generates
monovalent and multivalent DISA vaccines to combat specific field situations with
respect to Bluetongue.
