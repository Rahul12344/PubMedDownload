We report the isolation of Tamdy virus from Hyalomma asiaticum ticks in northwest
China and serologic evidence of human Tamdy virus infection in the same region.
These findings highlight the need to further investigate a potential causal
relationship between Tamdy virus and febrile illnesses of unknown etiology in
that region.
