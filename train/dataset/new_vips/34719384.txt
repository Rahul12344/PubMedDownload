BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among patients hospitalised with 
COVID-19 and associated with worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to
investigate the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in patients with
COVID-19 in a large UK tertiary centre.
METHODS: We analysed data of consecutive adults admitted with a
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 across two sites of a hospital in
London, UK, from 1st January to 13th May 2020.
RESULTS: Of the 1248 inpatients included, 487 (39%) experienced AKI (51% stage 1,
13% stage 2, and 36% stage 3). The weekly AKI incidence rate gradually increased 
to peak at week 5 (3.12 cases/100 patient-days), before reducing to its nadir
(0.83 cases/100 patient-days) at the end the study period (week 10). Among AKI
survivors, 84.0% had recovered renal function to pre-admission levels before
discharge and none required on-going renal replacement therapy (RRT).
Pre-existing renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 3.05, 95%CI 2.24-4,18;
p <  0.0001], and inpatient diuretic use (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.27-2.53; p <  0.005)
were independently associated with a higher risk for AKI. AKI was a strong
predictor of 30-day mortality with an increasing risk across AKI stages [adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95%CI 1.19-2.13) for stage 1; p < 0.005, 2.71(95%CI
1.82-4.05); p < 0.001for stage 2 and 2.99 (95%CI 2.17-4.11); p < 0.001for stage
3]. One third of AKI3 survivors (30.7%), had newly established renal impairment
at 3 to 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: This large UK cohort demonstrated a high AKI incidence and was
associated with increased mortality even at stage 1. Inpatient diuretic use was
linked to a higher AKI risk. One third of survivors with AKI3 exhibited newly
established renal impairment already at 3-6 months.
