The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an acceleration in the
development of web-based interventions to alleviate related mental health
impacts. The current study explored the effects of a short-term digital group
intervention aimed at providing cognitive behavioral and mindfulness tools and
skills to reduce loneliness and depression and to increase social support among
older adults in Israel. This pilot randomized controlled trial included
community-dwelling older adults (n = 82; aged between 65-90 years; 80% female)
who were randomized either to an intervention group (n = 64) or a wait-list
control group (n = 18). The intervention included seven online sessions, over 3.5
weeks. Depression, loneliness, and social support measures were administered at
baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Repeated
measures ANOVA revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in
depression in the intervention group, with results maintained at one-month
follow-up. Loneliness levels also significantly decreased post-intervention;
however, this benefit was not maintained at one-month follow-up. Social support
slightly increased both post-intervention and 1-month follow-up-but these changes
were not statistically significant. There were no overall changes for the
wait-list control group. Our intervention provided promising evidence regarding
the effectiveness of an online group intervention to alleviate mental health
effects and to promote the coping of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This relatively simple model can be effectively utilized by communities globally 
to help connect lonely and isolated older inhabitants, both during the pandemic
and in more routine times.
