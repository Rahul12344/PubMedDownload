Lipid droplets (LDs) are involved in viral infections, but exactly how remains
unclear. Here, we study the hepatitis C virus (HCV) whose core capsid protein
binds to LDs but is also involved in the assembly of virions at the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) bilayer. We found that the amphipathic helix-containing domain of 
core, D2, senses triglycerides (TGs) rather than LDs per se. In the absence of
LDs, D2 can bind to the ER membrane but only if TG molecules are present in the
bilayer. Accordingly, the pharmacological inhibition of the diacylglycerol
O-acyltransferase enzymes, mediating TG synthesis in the ER, inhibits D2
association with the bilayer. We found that TG molecules enable D2 to fold into
alpha helices. Sequence analysis reveals that D2 resembles the apoE lipid-binding
region. Our data support that TG in LDs promotes the folding of core, which
subsequently relocalizes to contiguous ER regions. During this motion, core may
carry TG molecules to these regions where HCV lipoviroparticles likely assemble. 
Consistent with this model, the inhibition of Arf1/COPI, which decreases LD
surface accessibility to proteins and ER-LD material exchange, severely impedes
the assembly of virions. Altogether, our data uncover a critical function of TG
in the folding of core and HCV replication and reveals, more broadly, how TG
accumulation in the ER may provoke the binding of soluble amphipathic
helix-containing proteins to the ER bilayer.
