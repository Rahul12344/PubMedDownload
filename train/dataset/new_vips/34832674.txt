This study investigated the influence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on the
cytokine production profiles of the peripheral blood monoculear cells (PBMC) and 
neutrophils in chronically naïve HCV-infected patients. Seventy-five genotype-4
naïve HCV-infected patients (HCV+) and healthy subjects (HCV-) were enrolled. The
neutrophils and the PBMC were separated by density gradient sedimentation and
stimulated with a mitogen. The culture supernatants were evaluated for levels of 
IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α using
anti-cytokine antibody MACSPlex capture beads. The PBMC cytokine profiles of HCV+
patients showed significantly lower mean values for IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, and 
IL-10 (p < 0.0001) as compared to HCV- subjects. In contrast, HCV+ patients
showed higher mean levels of PBMC cytokine values for IL-5 and TNF-α (p <
0.0001). As for neutrophils, HCV+ patients showed significantly lower mean levels
of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-10 (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the
neutrophils from HCV+ patients showed higher mean levels of IL-5, IL-12, and
TNF-α (p < 0.0001). Th1-Th2 cytokine ratios suggested a lower Th1 bias in HCV+
subjects as compared to HCV- subjects. Our results suggest that chronic HCV
infection brings about an immunomodulatory effect not only on neutrophils, but
also to a lower extent on PBMCs.
