Developing ecological approaches for disease control is critical for future
sustainable aquaculture development. White spot syndrome (WSS), caused by white
spot syndrome virus (WSSV), is the most severe disease in cultured shrimp
production. Culturing specific pathogen-free (SPF) broodstock is an effective and
widely used strategy for controlling WSS. However, most small-scale farmers, who 
predominate shrimp aquaculture in developing countries, cannot cultivate SPF
shrimp, as they do not have the required infrastructure and skills. Thus, these
producers are more vulnerable to WSS outbreaks than industrial farms. Here we
developed a shrimp polyculture system that prevents WSS outbreaks by introducing 
specific fish species. The system is easy to implement and requires no special
biosecurity measures. The promotion of this system in China demonstrated that it 
allowed small-scale farmers to improve their livelihood through shrimp
cultivation by controlling WSS outbreaks and increasing the production of ponds.
