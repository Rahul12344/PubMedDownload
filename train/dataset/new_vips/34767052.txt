The microbial community within the root system, the rhizosphere closely connected
to the root, and their symbiotic relationship with the host are increasingly seen
as possible drivers of natural pathogen resistance. Resistant cultivars have the 
most effective strategy in controlling the Chinese wheat yellow mosaic disease,
but the roles of the root and rhizosphere microbial interactions among different 
taxonomic levels of resistant cultivars are still unknown. Thus, we aimed to
investigate whether these microbial community composition and network
characteristics are related to disease resistance and to analyze the belowground 
plant-associated microflora. Relatively high microbial diversity and stable
community structure for the resistant cultivars were detected. Comparison
analysis showed that some bacterial phyla were significantly enriched in the
wheat root or rhizosphere of the resistant wheat cultivar. Furthermore, the root 
and rhizosphere of the resistant cultivars greatly recruited many known
beneficial bacterial and fungal taxa. In contrast, the relative abundance of
potential pathogens was higher for the susceptible cultivar than for the
resistant cultivar. Network co-occurrence analysis revealed that a much more
complex, more mutually beneficial, and a higher number of bacterial keystone taxa
in belowground microbial networks were displayed in the resistant cultivar, which
may have been responsible for maintaining the stability and ecological balance of
the microbial community. Overall, compared with the susceptible cultivar, the
resistant cultivar tends to recruit more potential beneficial microbial groups
for plant and rhizosphere microbial community interactions. These findings
indicate that beneficial rhizosphere microbiomes for cultivars should be targeted
and evaluated using community compositional profiles. KEY POINTS: • Different
resistance levels in cultivars affect the rhizosphere microbiome.. • Resistant
cultivars tend to recruit more potential beneficial microbial groups. • Bacteria 
occupy a high proportion and core position in the microflora network.
