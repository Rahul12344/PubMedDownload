Vaccination remains critical for viral disease outbreak prevention and control,
but conventional vaccine development typically involves trade-offs between safety
and immunogenicity. We used a recently discovered insect-specific flavivirus as a
vector in order to develop an exceptionally safe, flavivirus vaccine candidate
with single-dose efficacy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of this platform, 
we created a chimeric Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine candidate, designated Aripo/Zika 
virus (ARPV/ZIKV). ZIKV has caused immense economic and public health impacts
throughout the Americas and remains a significant public health threat. ARPV/ZIKV
vaccination showed exceptional safety due to ARPV/ZIKV's inherent vertebrate
host-restriction. ARPV/ZIKV showed no evidence of replication or translation in
vitro and showed no hematological, histological or pathogenic effects in vivo. A 
single-dose immunization with ARPV/ZIKV induced rapid and robust neutralizing
antibody and cellular responses, which offered complete protection against
ZIKV-induced morbidity, mortality and in utero transmission in immune-competent
and -compromised murine models. Splenocytes derived from vaccinated mice
demonstrated significant CD4+ and CD8+ responses and significant cytokine
production post-antigen exposure. Altogether, our results further support that
chimeric insect-specific flaviviruses are a promising strategy to restrict
flavivirus emergence via vaccine development.
