Cell adhesion is essential for the formation of organs, cellular migration, and
interaction with target cells and the extracellular matrix. Integrins are large
protein α/β-chain heterodimers and form a major family of cell adhesion
molecules. Recent research has dramatically increased our knowledge of how
integrin phosphorylations regulate integrin activity. Phosphorylations determine 
the signaling complexes formed on the cytoplasmic tails, regulating downstream
signaling. α-Chain phosphorylation is necessary for inducing β-chain
phosphorylation in LFA-1, and the crosstalk from one integrin to another
activating or inactivating its function is in part mediated by phosphorylation of
β-chains. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus 
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and possible integrin coreceptors
may crosstalk and induce a phosphorylation switch and autophagy.
