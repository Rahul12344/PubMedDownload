ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: For millennia, Artemisia annua L. was used in
Southeast Asia to treat "fever". This medicinal plant is effective against
multiple pathogens and is used by many global communities as a source of
artemisinin derivatives that are first-line drugs to treat malaria caused by
Plasmodium parasites.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) global pandemic has killed millions
and evolved numerous variants, with delta being the most transmissible to date
and causing break-through infections of vaccinated individuals. We further
queried the efficacy of A. annua cultivars against new variants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 cells, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity 
of dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L. extracts of four cultivars, A3, BUR, MED, and
SAM, to determine their efficacy against five infectious variants of the virus:
alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), delta (B.1.617.2), and kappa
(B.1.617.1).
RESULTS: In addition to being effective against the original wild type (WT) WA1, 
A. annua cultivars A3, BUR, MED, and SAM were also potent against all five
variants. IC50 and IC90 values based on measured artemisinin content ranged from 
0.3 to 8.4 μM and 1.4-25.0 μM, respectively. The IC50 and IC90 values based on
dried leaf weight (DW) used to make the tea infusions ranged from 11.0 to 67.7 μg
DW and 59.5-160.6 μg DW, respectively. Cell toxicity was insignificant at a leaf 
dry weight of ≤50 μg in the extract of any cultivar.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts
(tea infusions) could potentially provide a cost-effective therapy to help stave 
off the rapid global spread of these variants, buying time for broader
implementation of vaccines.
