OBJECTIVES: Mutation-specific PCR assays have quickly found their way into
laboratory diagnostics due to their capacity to be a fast, easy to implement and 
high-throughput method for the detection of known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 
(VoCs). However, little is known about the performance of such assays in routine 
laboratory analysis.
METHODS: The results reported in a recent round of an external quality assessment
(EQA) scheme for SARS-CoV-2 mutation-specific PCR were retrospectively analyzed. 
For the determination of individual variant-specific sequences as well as for the
interpretation results for certain virus variants, correct, incorrect, and
unreported results were evaluated, and their possible causes were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 34 laboratories participated in this study. For five samples 
containing the VoC Alpha + E484K, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or B.1.1.318 (as a variant 
of interest), 848 results for SARS-2-CoV mutation detection were reported, 824
(97.2%, range per sample 88-100%) of which were correct. Melting curve assays
gave 99% correct results, real-time RT-qPCR 94%, microarray-based assays 100%,
and MALDI-TOF MS 96%. A total of 122/167 (73%) reported results for SARS-CoV-2
variant determination were correct. Of the 45 inconclusive or incorrect results, 
33 (73%) were due to inadequate selection of targets that did not allow
identification of contemporary VoC, 11 (24%) were due to incorrect results, and
one (3%) was due to correct results of mutation-specific PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Careful and up-to-date selection of the targets used in
mutation-specific PCR is essential for successful detection of current SARS-CoV-2
variants.
