Infections with viral pathogens are widespread and can cause a variety of
different diseases. In-depth knowledge about viral triggers initiating an immune 
response is necessary to decipher viral pathogenesis. Inflammasomes, as part of
the innate immune system, can be activated by viral pathogens. However, viral
structural components responsible for inflammasome activation remain largely
unknown. Here we analyzed glycoproteins derived from SARS-CoV-1/2, HCMV and HCV, 
required for viral entry and fusion, as potential triggers of NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation and pyroptosis in THP-1 macrophages. All tested glycoproteins were
able to potently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicated by ASC-SPECK
formation and secretion of cleaved IL-1β. Lytic cell death via gasdermin D
(GSDMD), pore formation, and pyroptosis are required for IL-1β release. As a
hallmark of pyroptosis, we were able to detect cleavage of GSDMD and,
correspondingly, cell death in THP-1 macrophages. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of NLRP3
and GSDMD in THP-1 macrophages confirmed and strongly support the evidence that
viral glycoproteins can act as innate immunity triggers. With our study, we
decipher key mechanisms of viral pathogenesis by showing that viral glycoproteins
potently induce innate immune responses. These insights could be beneficial in
vaccine development and provide new impulses for the investigation of
vaccine-induced innate immunity.
