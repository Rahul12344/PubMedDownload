Obesity is a key correlate of severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes while the role of
obesity on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptom phenotype, and immune response
remain poorly defined. We examined data from a prospective SARS-CoV-2 cohort
study to address these questions. Serostatus, body mass index, demographics,
comorbidities, and prior COVID-19 compatible symptoms were assessed at baseline
and serostatus and symptoms monthly thereafter. SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays included 
an IgG ELISA targeting the spike RBD, multiarray Luminex targeting 20 viral
antigens, pseudovirus neutralization, and T cell ELISPOT assays. Our results from
a large prospective SARS-CoV-2 cohort study indicate symptom phenotype is
strongly influenced by obesity among younger but not older age groups; we did not
identify evidence to suggest obese individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection; and remarkably homogenous immune activity across BMI categories
suggests immune protection across these groups may be similar.
