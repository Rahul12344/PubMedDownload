The mouse is one of the wonderful inventions of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 
technology. Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still uses devices and
is not free of devices completely since it uses a battery for power and a dongle 
to connect it to the PC. In the proposed AI virtual mouse system, this limitation
can be overcome by employing webcam or a built-in camera for capturing of hand
gestures and hand tip detection using computer vision. The algorithm used in the 
system makes use of the machine learning algorithm. Based on the hand gestures,
the computer can be controlled virtually and can perform left click, right click,
scrolling functions, and computer cursor function without the use of the physical
mouse. The algorithm is based on deep learning for detecting the hands. Hence,
the proposed system will avoid COVID-19 spread by eliminating the human
intervention and dependency of devices to control the computer.
