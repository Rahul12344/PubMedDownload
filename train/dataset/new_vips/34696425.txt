Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) is known to be an etiological agent, causing
infections in laboratory rats. Until now, its role has only been considered in
studies on respiratory and salivary gland infections. The scant literature data, 
consisting mainly of papers from the last century, do not sufficiently address
the topic of SDAV infections. The ongoing pandemic has demonstrated, once again, 
the role of the Coronaviridae family as extremely dangerous etiological agents of
human zoonoses. The ability of coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and
change to hosts commonly found in close proximity to humans highlights the need
to characterize SDAV infections. The main host of the infection is the rat, as
mentioned above. Rats inhabit large urban agglomerations, carrying a vast
epidemic threat. Of the 2277 existing rodent species, 217 are reservoirs for 66
zoonotic diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. This review
provides insight into the current state of knowledge of SDAV characteristics and 
its likely zoonotic potential.
