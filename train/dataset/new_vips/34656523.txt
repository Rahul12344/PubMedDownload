INTRODUCTION: Brazil has a high number of HTLV-1/2 infections which are unequally
distributed in the country. Most prevalence studies have focused on specific
populations, such as blood donors and pregnant women. Some areas, for example the
state of Bahia, have robust information about HTLV-1/2 infection, however there
is no information available about this infection in the general population of
Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 infection in adults from the
municipality of Vitoria, ES.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed from September 2010 to December
2011, in individuals of both sexes, aged 18 or older living in Vitória-ES. Venous
blood samples were collected and tested for anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies by
chemiluminescent immunoassay (CMIA). Individuals with CMIA reactive results were 
submitted to a new blood collection for retesting by CMIA, followed by PCR to
confirm infection and discriminate the viral type.
RESULTS: From 1502 tested samples, eight were reactive in CMIA and all were
confirmed by PCR. Therefore, the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 was 0.53% (8/1502, 95%
CI: 0.2-1.0%). The infection rate was 0.7% in men (5/711, 95% CI: 0.17-1.51%),
and 0.38% in women (3/791, 95% CI: 0-0.81%).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HTLV-1/2 infection was 0.53% (8/1502; 95% CI:
0.2-0.9%). Confirmatory test using real-time PCR (qPCR) identified seven
individuals positive for HTLV-1 and one for HTLV-2. Considering the risk of
infected individuals to develop high morbidity and mortality diseases, it would
be important to implement public health policies aimed at stopping transmission
of these viruses in this municipality.
