The bronchial vascular endothelial network plays important roles in pulmonary
pathology during respiratory viral infections, including respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), influenza A(H1N1) and importantly SARS-Cov-2. All of these
infections can be severe and even lethal in patients with underlying risk
factors.A major obstacle in disease prevention is the lack of appropriate
efficacious vaccine(s) due to continuous changes in the encoding capacity of the 
viral genome, exuberant responsiveness of the host immune system and lack of
effective antiviral drugs. Current management of these severe respiratory viral
infections is limited to supportive clinical care. The primary cause of morbidity
and mortality is respiratory failure, partially due to endothelial pulmonary
complications, including edema. The latter is induced by the loss of alveolar
epithelium integrity and by pathological changes in the endothelial vascular
network that regulates blood flow, blood fluidity, exchange of fluids,
electrolytes, various macromolecules and responses to signals triggered by
oxygenation, and controls trafficking of leukocyte immune cells. This overview
outlines the latest understanding of the implications of pulmonary vascular
endothelium involvement in respiratory distress syndrome secondary to viral
infections. In addition, the roles of infection-induced cytokines, growth
factors, and epigenetic reprogramming in endothelial permeability, as well as
emerging treatment options to decrease disease burden, are discussed.
