Mosquitoes in the Aedes and Culex genera are considered the main vectors of
pathogenic flaviviruses worldwide. Entomological surveillance using universal
flavivirus sets of primers in mosquitoes can detect not only pathogenic viruses
but also insect-specific ones. It is hypothesized that insect-specific
flaviviruses, which naturally infect these mosquitoes, may influence their vector
competence for zoonotic arboviruses. Here, entomological surveillance was
performed between January 2014 and May 2018 in five different provinces in the
northeastern parts of South Africa, with the aim of identifying circulating
flaviviruses. Mosquitoes were sampled using different carbon dioxide trap types. 
Overall, 64,603 adult mosquitoes were collected, which were screened by RT-PCR
and sequencing. In total, 17 pools were found positive for insect-specific
Flaviviruses in the mosquito genera Aedes (12/17, 70.59%) and Anopheles (5/17,
29.41%). No insect-specific viruses were detected in Culex species. Cell-fusing
agent viruses were detected in Aedes aegypti and Aedes caballus. A range of
anopheline mosquitoes, including Anopheles coustani, An. squamosus and An.
maculipalpis, were positive for Culex flavivirus-like and Anopheles flaviviruses.
These results confirm the presence of insect-specific flaviviruses in mosquito
populations in South Africa, expands their geographical range and indicates
potential mosquito species as vector species.
