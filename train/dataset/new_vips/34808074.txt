Incubation Period for Neuroinvasive Toscana Virus Infections.

Laroche L, Jourdain F, Ayhan N, Ba√±uls AL, Charrel R, Prudhomme J.

Toscana virus (TOSV) is an emerging pathogen in the Mediterranean area and is
neuroinvasive in its most severe form. Basic knowledge on TOSV biology is
limited. We conducted a systematic review on travel-related infections to
estimate the TOSV incubation period. We estimated the incubation period at 12.1
days.
