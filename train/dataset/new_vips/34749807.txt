BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic context, a massive shortage of personal
protective equipment occurred. To increase the available stocks, several
countries appealed for donations from individuals or industries. While national
and international standards to evaluate personal protective equipment exist, none
of the previous research studied how to evaluate personal protective equipment
coming from donations to healthcare establishments. Our aim was to evaluate the
quality and possible use of the personal protective equipment donations delivered
to our health care establishment in order to avoid a shortage and to protect
health care workers throughout the COVID-19 crisis.
METHODS: Our intervention focused on evaluation of the quality of donations for
medical use through creation of a set of assessment criteria and analysis of the 
economic impact of these donations.
RESULTS: Between 20th March 2020 and 11th May 2020, we received 239 donations
including respirators, gloves, coveralls, face masks, gowns, hats, overshoes,
alcohol-based hand rubs, face shields, goggles and aprons. A total of 448,666
(86.3%) products out of the 519,618 initially received were validated and
distributed in health care units, equivalent to 126 (52.7%) donations out of the 
239 received. The budgetary value of the validated donations was 32,872 euros
according to the pre COVID-19 prices and 122,178 euros according to the current
COVID-19 prices, representing an increase of 371.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: By ensuring a constant influx of personal protective equipment and
proper stock management, shortages were avoided. Procurement and distribution of 
controlled and validated personal protective equipment is the key to providing
quality care while guaranteeing health care worker safety.
