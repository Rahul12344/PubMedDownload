BACKGROUND: Following the introduction of direct-acting antiviral therapy in
2013, WHO launched the first Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis. We
describe a hepatitis C virus (HCV) cascade of care in people with HIV (PWH)
across Europe in terms of reaching the WHO elimination targets of diagnosing 90% 
and treating 80% of HCV-infected individuals.
METHODS: HIV/HCV-coinfected participants in the EuroSIDA cohort under prospective
follow-up at October 1, 2019, were described using a nine-stage cascade of care. 
Care cascades were constructed across Europe, on a regional (n = 5) and country
(n = 21) level.
RESULTS: Of 4773 anti-HCV positive PWH, 4446 [93.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI)
92.4-93.9)] were ever tested for HCV RNA, and 19.0% (95% CI 16.4-21.6) were
currently HCV RNA positive, with the highest prevalence in Eastern and
Central-Eastern Europe (33.7 and 29.6%, respectively). In Eastern Europe, 78.1%
of the estimated number of chronic infections have been diagnosed, whereas this
proportion was above 95% in the other four regions. Overall, 3116 persons have
ever started treatment (72.5% of the ever chronically infected, 95% CI 70.9-74.0)
and 2404 individuals (55.9% of the ever chronically infected, 95% CI 53.9-57.9)
were cured. Cure proportion ranged from 11.2% in Belarus to 87.2% in Austria.
CONCLUSION: In all regions except Eastern Europe, more than 90% of the study
participants have been tested for HCV-RNA. In Southern and Central-Western
regions, more than 80% ever chronically HCV-infected PWH received treatment. The 
proportion with cured HCV infection did not exceed 80% in any region, with
significant heterogeneity between countries.
SUMMARY: In a pan-European cohort of PWH, all regions except Eastern Europe
achieved the WHO target of diagnosing 90% of chronic HCV infections, while the
target of treating 80% of eligible persons was achieved in none of the regions.
