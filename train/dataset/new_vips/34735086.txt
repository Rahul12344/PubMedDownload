INTRODUCTION: It has been more than a year since the first case of Covid-19 was
diagnosed in Brazil, and its most problematic feature is the oversaturation of
the healthcare system capacity. Urolithiasis is a disease that requires timely
and appropriate management. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of the
pandemic in hospital admissions for urolithiasis in the Brazilian public
healthcare system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, hospital admissions were
obtained from the Brazilian Public Health Information system. All hospital
admissions associated with urolithiasis diagnosis (ICD-10 N20) between March 2017
and February 2021 were analyzed.
RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a significant decrease in
hospital admissions (p<0.0001). More than 20.000 patients probably did not have
the opportunity to undergo their surgeries. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak
on women's admissions was significantly more intense than for men, reducing from 
48.91% to 48.36% of the total (p=0.0281). The extremes of age seemed to be more
affected, with patients younger than 20 years and older than 60 years having a
significant reduction in access to hospital services (p=0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have noticed a considerable reduction in overall
admissions for the treatment of urolithiasis in the Brazilian public healthcare
system during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Women and individuals
older than 60 years were especially affected. In contrast, we noted a rise in
urgent procedures, comparing with the average of the corresponding period of the 
three previous years. Recovery plans will be needed while returning to activities
to handle the impounded surgical volume.
