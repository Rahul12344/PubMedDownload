Pandemic "Disability Cons".

Dorfman D.

Disability rights law has made issues of access and accommodations much more
visible in American life. Yet a byproduct of the increased awareness of
disability rights has been "fear of the disability con," that is, the common
apprehension that people are abusing the law to gain an unfair advantage. Many
times, this moral panic creates an invisible, oft-overlooked barrier for people
with disabilities who desire to utilize their rights. They either are refused the
right altogether or give up asking for it in the first place because they are
afraid of being accused of being fakers. This Article shows how fear of the
disability con surfaced along the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. It
describes the schism between the ways in which people with disabilities generally
fared under the pandemic and some popular perceptions regarding the "privileges" 
they allegedly received because of their protected legal status. Those so-called 
privileges include mask exemptions, vaccination priority, and permission to
continue remote work. The Article concludes with lessons the COVID-19 pandemic
experience can teach us about the nature and scope of the fear of the disability 
con.
