A computational investigation was carried out to find out potential
phytochemicals that could inhibit the binding of human angiotensin-converting
enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 which is an essential
step to gain entry inside human cells and onset of viral infection known as
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A library of phytochemicals was screened by
virtual screening against ACE2 receptors resulting in twenty phytochemicals out
of 686 which had binding energy (-11.8 to -6.9â€‰kcal/mol). Drug-likeness gave five
hits, but ADMET analysis yielded 4 nontoxic hit phytochemicals. Molecular
dynamics simulation of four-hit compounds resulted in acceptable stability and
good dynamics behavior. These phytochemicals are Hinokinin, Gmelanone,
Isocolumbin, and Tinocordioside, from Vitis vinifera, Gmelina arborea, and
Tinospora cordifolia. The above-mentioned phytochemicals may be promising ACE2
inhibitors and can prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the entry of the
virus into host cells.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
