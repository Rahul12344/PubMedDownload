The past decade has seen near continual global public health crises caused by
emerging viral infections. Extraordinary increases in our knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying successful antiviral immune responses in animal models and 
during human infection have accompanied these viral outbreaks. Keeping pace with 
the rapidly advancing field of viral immunology, innovations in microscopy have
afforded a previously unseen view of viral infection occurring in real-time in
living animals. Here, we review the contribution of intravital imaging to our
understanding of cell-mediated immune responses to viral infections, with a
particular focus on studies that visualize the antiviral effector cells
responding to infection as well as virus-infected cells. We discuss methods to
visualize viral infection in vivo using intravital microscopy (IVM) and
significant findings arising through the application of IVM to viral infection.
Collectively, these works underscore the importance of developing a comprehensive
spatial understanding of the relationships between immune effectors and
virus-infected cells and how this has enabled unique discoveries about virus/host
interactions and antiviral effector cell biology.
