Microbial keratitis is an infection of the cornea of the eye that is commonly
caused by prolonged contact lens wear, corneal trauma, pre-existing systemic
disorders and other ocular surface disorders. It can result in severe visual
impairment if improperly managed. According to the latest World Vision Report, at
least 4.2 million people worldwide suffer from corneal opacities caused by
infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria, protozoa and viruses. In patients with
fungal keratitis (FK), often overt symptoms are not evident, until an advanced
stage. Furthermore, it has been reported that clear discrimination between
bacterial keratitis and FK is a challenging process even for trained corneal
experts and is often misdiagnosed in more than 30% of the cases. However, if
diagnosed early, vision impairment can be prevented through early cost-effective 
interventions. In this work, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural
network (MS-CNN) for accurate segmentation of the corneal region to enable early 
FK diagnosis. The proposed approach consists of a deep neural pipeline for
corneal region segmentation followed by a ResNeXt model to differentiate between 
FK and non-FK classes. The model trained on the segmented images in the region of
interest, achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 88.96%. The features learnt by the
model emphasize that it can correctly identify dominant corneal lesions for
detecting FK.
