Yellow fever (YF) is a major public-health problem in Africa. Yellow fever virus 
(YFV), the etiological agent responsible for the disease, exhibits clear
delineation of phylogeography between East/Central Africa and West Africa. In
order to decipher the genetic nature of the YFV epidemic between these areas, we 
performed a genome-wide study on its African isolates using the McDonald-Kreitman
(MK) test in combination with the type II functional divergence analysis. The
results showed that adaptive genetic diversifications have occurred on viral
nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and NS5, which are essential for viral genome
replication and immune antagonism, with the East/Central African-West African
epidemic split. On both proteins, a number of amino acid replacements have been
favored by functional divergence. These findings could help to bridge the gap
between the phylogeographic delineation and niche adaptation underlying the
YFV-epidemic across Africa and shed light on viral determinants of this process.
