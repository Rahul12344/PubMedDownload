INTRODUCTION: Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection represents an unprecedented public health problem and, at present,
vaccination is the only weapon available to combat the infection. The simplest
and most immediate method to quantify the response of the subject's immune system
to vaccination and / or infection is the serological assessment of the antibody
titer. The objective of our study was 1) to evaluate the presence of antibody
responses in a sample of healthcare workers subjected to a complete vaccination
course as per ministerial provisions (double dose for negatives and single dose
for ex-SARS-CoV subjects -2 positive) with Comirnaty vaccine (Pfizer / BioNTech) 
2) evaluate the presence of statistically significant associations for sex, age
and previous positive swab.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: the antibody levels of both nucleocapsid antibodies and
anti-Sars-CoV2 Spike antibodies of the study subjects were examined with the
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) method developed by Roche®. The
cut-off value, as suggested by the manufacturer, for anti-nucleocapsid antibodies
was 1 COI, while the Ig Spike value was 0.8 I / mL. The study sample was
stratified by age (≤45 years, 46-55, ≥56 years old), previous positive molecular 
swab, gender and IgG S1 / S2 values ​​at the completed vaccination course (≤200, 
≥200 AU / mL ). Statistical analyzes were carried out with the R software.
RESULTS: almost all of the sample (89.45%) showed IgG Spike values> 200 AU / mL
with statistically significant associations in relation to sex (greater in
females, p≤0.05), to previous swab positivity in the presence of a vaccine dose
(n = 44; p <0.001) and at age (with greater antibody response in subjects under
45; p <0.001).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The current study confirms what is reported in the
literature. In the light of the results obtained, it could be interesting to
promote studies that evaluate the antibody titers trend over time a) in women of 
childbearing age and postmenopausal age b) in particular categories of subjects
with chronic degenerative diseases to assess the actual need for doses booster,
it being understood that the immune system response is guaranteed by both
cellular and humoral immunity and that the antibody titer does not faithfully
reflect the protection obtained.
