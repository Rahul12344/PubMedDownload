BACKGROUND: Faced with the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease, the
'National Reference Centre for Whole Genome Sequencing of microbial pathogens:
database and bioinformatic analysis' (GENPAT) formally established at the
'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise' (IZSAM) in
Teramo (Italy) is in charge of the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at the genomic scale. 
In a context of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance requiring correct and fast assessment of 
epidemiological clusters from substantial amount of samples, the present study
proposes an analytical workflow for identifying accurately the PANGO lineages of 
SARS-CoV-2 samples and building of discriminant minimum spanning trees (MST)
bypassing the usual time consuming phylogenomic inferences based on multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) and substitution model.
RESULTS: GENPAT constituted two collections of SARS-CoV-2 samples. The first
collection consisted of SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs collected by IZSAM from the
Abruzzo region (Italy), then sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) and
analyzed in GENPAT (n = 1592), while the second collection included samples from 
several Italian provinces and retrieved from the reference Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (n = 17,201). The main results of the present
work showed that (i) GENPAT and GISAID detected the same PANGO lineages, (ii) the
PANGO lineages B.1.177 (i.e. historical in Italy) and B.1.1.7 (i.e. 'UK variant')
are major concerns today in several Italian provinces, and the new MST-based
method (iii) clusters most of the PANGO lineages together, (iv) with a higher
dicriminatory power than PANGO lineages, (v) and faster that the usual
phylogenomic methods based on MSA and substitution model.
CONCLUSIONS: The genome sequencing efforts of Italian provinces, combined with a 
structured national system of NGS data management, provided support for
surveillance SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. We propose to build phylogenomic trees of
SARS-CoV-2 variants through an accurate, discriminant and fast MST-based method
avoiding the typical time consuming steps related to MSA and substitution
model-based phylogenomic inference.
