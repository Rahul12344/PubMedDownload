Although stem cell aging leads to a decline in tissue homeostasis and
regenerative capacity, it remains unclear whether salivary gland stem cell
function changes during this process. However, the salivary glands are gradually 
replaced by connective tissue during aging. Here, we show a decline in the stem
cell ability of CD133-positive stem/progenitor cells in the salivary glands of
aged mice. The CD133-positive cells were isolated from young, adult, and aged
mice. The number of CD133-positive cells was significantly decreased in aged
mice. They also showed a lower sphere formation capacity compared to young and
adult mice. RNA sequencing revealed that CD133-positive cells in aged mice
exhibited lower gene expression of several aging-related genes, including FoxO3a,
than those in young and adult mice. Salivary gland cells infected with a
recombinant lentivirus encoding the FoxO3a gene showed a reduction in oxidative
stress induced by hydrogen peroxide compared with those infected with a control
virus. Thus, FoxO3a may inhibit stem cell aging via oxidative stress.
