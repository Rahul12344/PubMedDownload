Up to 40% of dementias may be preventable via risk factor modification. This
inference has motivated the development of lifestyle interventions for reducing
cognitive decline. Typically delivered to older adults face-to-face, the COVID-19
pandemic has necessitated their adaptation for remote delivery. We systematically
reviewed randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered lifestyle
interventions (≥4 weeks duration and delivered >50% remotely), for adults aged
≥ 60 without dementia, examining effects on objective cognitive measures.
Comparators were active (face-to-face or remote) or passive. Ten studies
(n = 2967) comprising multidomain (k = 4), physical activity (k = 3) or
psychosocial (k = 3) remote interventions were included. Data were synthesized
using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. The pooled estimate comparing the
effect of remote interventions versus comparators on cognition was not
significant (g=-0.02; 95%CI [-0.14, 0.09]; p = .66); subgroup analyses by type of
intervention or comparator also yielded non-significant effects. Most studies had
low risk of bias. Current evidence to support remote lifestyle interventions is
limited. Included studies were conducted pre-pandemic, and evaluated individual, 
rather than group interventions. Future studies may exploit the greater digital
connectivity of older people since the pandemic. Group formats, more frequently
efficacious than individual interventions in face-to-face dementia prevention
trials, may be a rational approach for future remote trials.
