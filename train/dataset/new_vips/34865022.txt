BACKGROUND: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is now the predominant variant
worldwide. However, its transmission dynamics remain unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed 405 local case-patients infected with the Delta variant of
SARS-CoV-2 and temporal patterns of viral shedding identified between 22 June and
31 July 2021 in Daejeon, South Korea.
RESULTS: Overall, 20% were presymptomatic at the time of epidemiological
investigation. We identified six clustered outbreaks, and all were associated
with indoor facilities. In 23 household contacts, the secondary attack rate was
63%. We estimated the mean serial interval as 3.26 days (95% credible interval,
2.92-3.60), and 15% (95% confidence interval, 13-18%) of cases seeded 80% of all 
local transmission. Analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab samples identified virus 
shedding from the presymptomatic patients, and the highest viral load was
observed two days after symptom onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Delta variant is highly transmissible 
in indoor settings and households. Rapid contact tracing, isolation of the
asymptomatic contacts, strict adherence to public health measures, and increased 
uptake of COVID-19 vaccination including booster doses are needed to reduce the
community transmission of the Delta variant.
