Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia can suffer from pneumothorax and persistent
air leak (PAL). The pneumothorax occurs with or without pre-existing lung
disease. PAL refers to air leak lasting more than 5-7 days and arises due to
bronchopleural or alveolopleural fistula. The management of PAL can be
challenging as a standard management guideline is lacking. Here we present the
case of a 42-year-old smoker with COVID-19 who presented to the hospital with
fever, cough, acute left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. He suffered
from a large left-sided pneumothorax requiring immediate chest tube drainage.
Unfortunately, the air leak persisted for 13 days before one-way endobronchial
valve (EBV) was used with complete resolution of the air leak. We also review the
literature regarding other cases of EBV utilisation for PAL in patients with
COVID-19.
