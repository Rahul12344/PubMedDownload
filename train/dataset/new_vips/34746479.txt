Children are particularly impressionable and at risk during a global public
health crisis, making it essential to examine their unique perspectives. To hear 
and understand sub-Saharan African children's experiences with the COVID-19
pandemic, we conducted an exploratory qualitative analysis based on interviews
with 51 children, ages 9 to 13, from Nigeria, Tanzania, and Sierra Leone.
Applying the organization of Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, we
reveal how COVID-19 affected children's daily lives and domestic challenges,
schooling and neighborhood issues, media use (and its relationship to knowledge
and fear of the disease), perceptions of the country, and government response,
and thoughts of religion and hope. Children's responses dif-fered greatly, but
patterns emerged across sex, age, household size, religion, and country. This
study offers guidance and recommendations for meeting the needs of children,
especially in times of crisis.
