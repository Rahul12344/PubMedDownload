Cambodia detected its first case of COVID-19 just 3 days before WHO declared that
the outbreak constituted as PHEIC. As of February 15, 2021, and after two major
outbreaks, only 479 cases had been reported, 396 (83%) of which were imported.
This small number of cases was largely thanks to stringent measures and policies 
put in place by the government to curb the spread. Despite these efforts, a third
cluster outbreak was declared on February 20, 2021. It has disrupted all aspects 
of life in Cambodia. As in many other countries affected by the virus, economic
hardship, lockdowns in cities, and food insecurity ensued. Against the backdrop
of this widespread impact on the citizens of Cambodia, we conducted this review
article to better understand the situation of healthcare workers in nephrology
and dialysis patients and the challenge they face in providing and receiving
essential medical care. Healthcare providers have continued working to serve
their patients despite facing a high risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 and other
challenges including difficulties in traveling to work, increased physical and
mental burden, and higher stress due to measures taken to minimize the risk of
transmission during patients' care. Some healthcare workers have been
discriminated against by neighbors. The most difficult mission is when having to 
deal with families whose loved one is denied access to a hemodialysis session due
to suspected COVID-19 while waiting for PCR test results. Hemodialysis patients
reported facing economic hardship and increasingly difficult circumstances. When 
access to food is limited, patients have eaten canned or dried salted food rather
than an appropriate hemodialysis diet. Because hemodialysis centers are
concentrated in a few cities, access has become even harder during the travel
ban. In-center hemodialysis rules are stricter and does not allow family members 
or escorts to enter the unit. Only a few hemodialysis patients have been
vaccinated. Before COVID-19, hemodialysis patients already faced major burdens.
The pandemic appears to be decreasing their quality of life and survival even
further. Through this study, we have revealed current hardships and the need to
improve the situations for both healthcare workers in nephrology and hemodialysis
patients in Cambodia.
