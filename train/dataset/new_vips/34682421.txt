Older adults are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 in terms of both disease
severity and risk of death. To compare clinical differences between older
COVID-19 hospitalized survivors and non-survivors, we investigated variables
influencing mortality in all older adults with COVID-19 hospitalized in Poznań,
Poland, through the end of June 2020 (n = 322). In-hospital, post-discharge, and 
overall 180-day mortality were analyzed. Functional capacity prior to COVID-19
diagnosis was also documented. The mean age of subjects was 77.5 ± 10.0 years;
among them, 191 were females. Ninety-five (29.5%) died during their
hospitalization and an additional 30 (9.3%) during the post-discharge period (up 
to 180 days from the hospital admission). In our study, male sex, severe
cognitive impairment, underlying heart disease, anemia, and elevated plasma
levels of IL-6 were independently associated with greater mortality during
hospitalization. During the overall 180-day observation period (from the hospital
admission), similar characteristics, excluding male sex and additionally
functional impairment, were associated with increased mortality. During the
post-discharge period, severe functional impairment remained the only
determinant. Therefore, functional capacity prior to diagnosis should be
considered when formulating comprehensive prognoses as well as care plans for
older patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
