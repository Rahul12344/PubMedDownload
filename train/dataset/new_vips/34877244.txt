Since November 6th, 2020, Italian regions have been classified according to four 
levels, corresponding to specific risk scenarios, for which specific restrictive 
measures have been foreseen. By analyzing the time evolution of the reproduction 
number R t , we estimate how much different restrictive measures affect R t , and
we quantify the combined effect of the diffusion of virus variants and the
beginning of the vaccination campaign upon the R t trend. We also compute the
time delay between implementation of restrictive measures and the resulting
effects. Three different models to describe the effects of restrictive measures
are discussed and the results are cross-checked with two different algorithms for
the computation of R t .
