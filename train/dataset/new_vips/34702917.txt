Bats are potential natural reservoirs for emerging viruses, causing deadly human 
diseases, such as COVID-19, MERS, SARS, Nipah, Hendra, and Ebola infections. The 
fundamental mechanisms by which bats are considered "living bioreactors" for
emerging viruses are not fully understood. Some studies suggest that tolerance to
viruses is linked to suppressing antiviral immune and inflammatory responses due 
to DNA damage by energy generated to fly. Our study reveals that bats' gut
bacteria could also be involved in the host and its microbiota's DNA damage. We
performed screening of lactic acid bacteria and bacilli isolated from bats' feces
for mutagenic and oxidative activity by lux-biosensors. The pro-mutagenic
activity was determined when expression of recA increased with the appearance of 
double-strand breaks in the cell DNA, while an increase of katG expression in the
presence of hydroxyl radicals indicated antioxidant activity. We identified that 
most of the isolated bacteria have pro-mutagenic and antioxidant properties at
the same time. This study reveals new insights into bat gut microbiota's
potential involvement in antiviral response and opens new frontiers in preventing
emerging diseases originating from bats.
