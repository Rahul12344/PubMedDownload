Glycosylation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
spike glycoprotein mediates viral entry and immune escape. While glycan site is
determined by viral genetic code, glycosylation is completely dependent on host
cell post-translational modification. Here, by producing SARS-CoV-2 virions from 
various host cell lines, viruses of different origins with diverse spike protein 
glycan patterns were revealed. Binding affinities to C-type lectin receptors
(CLRs) DC&L-SIGN differed in the different glycan pattern virions. Although none 
of the CLRs supported viral productive infection, viral trans&cis-infection
mediated by the CLRs were substantially changed among the different virions.
Specifically, trans&cis-infection of virions with a high-mannose structure
(Man5GlcNAc2) at the N1098 glycan site of the spike postfusion trimer were
markedly enhanced. Considering L-SIGN co-expression with ACE2 on respiratory
tract cells, our work underlines viral epigenetic glycosylation in authentic
viral infection and highlights the attachment co-receptor role of DC&L-SIGN in
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevention.
