The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the urgent clinical
need for efficient virus therapies and vaccines. Although the functional
importance of antibodies is indisputable in viral infections, there are still
significant unmet needs that require vast improvements in antibody-based
therapeutics. The IgG Fc domain can be engineered to produce antibodies with
tailored and potent responses that will meet these clinical demands. Engaging Fc 
receptors (FcRs) to perform effector functions as cytotoxicity, phagocytosis,
complement activation, intracellular neutralization and controlling antibody
persistence. Furthermore, it produces vaccine-like effects by activating signals 
to stimulate T-cell responses, have proven to be required for protection, as
neutralization alone does not off the full protection capacity of antibodies.
This review highlights antiviral Fc functions and FcRs' contributions in linking 
innate and adaptive immunity against viral threats. Moreover, it provides the
latest Fc engineering strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of human
antiviral antibodies and vaccines.
