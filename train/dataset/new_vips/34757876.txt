The COVID-19 Pandemic Upended Youth Sports.

Flynn J, Trentacosta N.

The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that approximately 35 to 45 million 
young people age 6 to 18 years participate in some type of athletics every year. 
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
interrupted youth sports and left many children unable to train in-person with
teammates and coaches. Given the large impact sports and physical activity have
on the lives of children and adolescents, the effect that coronavirus disease
2019 restrictions have had on the psychological and physical well-being of young 
athletes is significant. The youth sports community has worked hard to find
creative ways to safely bring children and adolescents back to the fields and
courts with rules and regulations in place. Youth practices and competitions are 
potential spreader events for SARS-CoV-2, especially given the challenge of
identifying young athletes and other participants with asymptomatic active viral 
infection. With the implementation of rapid result testing programs and the US
Food and Drug Administration approval of a highly effective vaccine in
adolescents and, most recently, in younger children, youth sports are once again 
becoming a place for young athletes to train, socialize, and learn invaluable
lessons in teamwork and leadership. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(11):e450-e453.].
