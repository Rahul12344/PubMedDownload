Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory disease caused by the
highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mutations of SARS-CoV-2 accumulate. These
mutations may not only make the virus spread faster, but also render current
vaccines less effective. In this study, we established a reference sequence for
each clade defined using the GISAID typing method. Homology analysis of each
reference sequence confirmed a low mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2, with the latest 
clade GRY having the lowest homology with other clades (99.89%-99.93%), and the
homology between other clade being greater than or equal to 99.95%. Variation
analyses showed that the earliest genotypes S, V, and G had 2, 3, and 3
characterizing mutations in the genome respectively. The G-derived clades GR, GH,
and GV had 5, 6, and 13 characterizing mutations in the genome respectively. A
total of 28 characterizing mutations existed in the genome of the latest clades
GRY. In addition, we found differences in the geographic distribution of
different clades. G, GH, and GR are popular in the USA, while GV and GRY are
common in the UK. Our work may facilitate the custom design of antiviral
strategies depending on the molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.
