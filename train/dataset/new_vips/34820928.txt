OBJECTIVE: The current study analysed the viral safety among Iranian blood
donors.
BACKGROUND: Plasma products demand is increasing in the world. With contract
plasma fractionation, the plasma wastage decreases and the access of patients to 
plasma-derived medicines (PDM) improves.
STUDY AND DESIGN METHOD: Screening results including hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Ag/Ab of 19 054 036 donations from 2006 to 2015 were analysed. The plasma for
fractionation was tested for HBV DNA, HCV RNA, HIV RNA, HAV RNA, and Parvovirus
B19 DNA by fractionators. New samples were collected from the positive donors and
retested. The prevalence of serological and nucleic acid testing (NAT) markers
per 105 donations, 95% confidential interval (CI), and p-values were calculated.
RESULTS: The prevalence of markers was as follows: 250/105 donations for HBsAg
from 516 in 2006 to 116/105 donations in 2015; 74/105 donations for HCV,
decreasing from 127 to 41/105 and 3.6/105 for HIV during current study. During
10 years, 5 713 641 units of recovered plasma were shipped for contract
fractionation to produce PDM; 0.26/105 donations for HBV DNA and 0.14/105 for HCV
RNA were reported positive. The results of five retested samples for HBV and one 
sample for HCV were negative.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donations was extremely 
low. Thanks to the availability, high quality and safety of recovered plasma as a
result of the improvements in the quality system at IBTO, this plasma could be
used for the production of PDMPs.
