Background: Based on evidence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B
virus (HBV) have common transmission routes; co-infection of HBV/HIV can
dramatically increase disease progression. The present study aimed to determine
the prevalence of overt HBV infection and occult hepatitis B virus infection
(OBI) in HIV-positive people.
Methods: In this descriptive study, whole blood samples were collected from 184
HIV-positive subjects referring to the Consultation Center for Behavioral
Diseases, Sanandaj, Iran, during 2014 to 2016. ELISA was used for the
determination of HBV serologic markers (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and
antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen [anti-HBc]). To evaluate OBI, DNA
was extracted only from HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive samples and tested
for HBV DNA by real-time PCR. Test results and patients’ data were analyzed by
SPSS software.
Results: The mean age of the study population was 39.2 ± 9.4 (SD) years, of whom 
140 (76%) were male. Overall, 43 (23.3%) samples were positive for HBsAg (overt
HBV infection), and 50 (27.2%) for anti-HBc. Among 31 HBsAg-negative and
anti-HBc-positive samples (suspected OBI), one (3.2%) sample was positive for HBV
DNA (verified seropositive OBI). HBV infection was higher among males (n = 37;
86.05%), jobless people (n = 23; 53.49%), and those with an injection HIV
transmission route (n = 32; 74.43%).
Conclusion: We observed a high prevalence of overt HBV and one OBI among the
study population. A serologic marker such as anti-HBc indicates resolved or past 
HBV infection. Molecular screening for HBV is valuable for the management of
HIV-infected people.
