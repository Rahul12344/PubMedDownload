OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the COVID-19 experts who appear most frequently in
media have high citation impact for their research overall, and for their
COVID-19 peer-reviewed publications in particular and to examine the
representation of women among such experts.
DESIGN: Cross-linking of data sets of most highly visible COVID-19 media experts 
with citation data on the impact of their published work (career-long publication
record and COVID-19-specific work).
SETTING: Cable news appearance in prime-time programming or overall media
appearances.
PARTICIPANTS: Most highly visible COVID-19 media experts in the USA, Switzerland,
Greece and Denmark.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Citation data from Scopus along with discipline-specific ranks 
of overall career-long and COVID-19-specific impact based on a previously
validated composite citation indicator.
RESULTS: We assessed 76 COVID-19 experts who were highly visible in US prime-time
cable news, and 50, 12 and 2 highly visible experts in media in Denmark, Greece
and Switzerland, respectively. Of those, 23/76, 10/50, 2/12 and 0/2 were among
the top 2% of overall citation impact among scientists in the same discipline
worldwide. Moreover, 37/76, 15/50, 7/12 and 2/2 had published anything on
COVID-19 that was indexed in Scopus as of 30 August 2021. Only 18/76, 6/50, 2/12 
and 0/2 of the highly visible COVID-19 media experts were women. 55 scientists in
the USA, 5 in Denmark, 64 in Greece and 56 in Switzerland had a higher citation
impact for their COVID-19 work than any of the evaluated highly visible media
COVID-19 experts in the respective country; 10/55, 2/5, 22/64 and 14/56 of them
were women.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite notable exceptions, there is a worrisome disconnect between 
COVID-19 claimed media expertise and scholarship. Highly cited women COVID-19
experts are rarely included among highly visible media experts.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interests: JPI has given some COVID-19 
media interviews (a hundredfold less compared with some of the listed experts)
that have resulted in smearing, hate emails, threats, censoring, hostile
behaviour, harassment and a life-threatening experience for a family member. He
is among the top-cited scientists in both the overall and COVID-19-specific
citation databases used in the presented analyses. In his Stanford web page, he
admits that despite being ‘among the 10 scientists worldwide who are currently
the most commonly cited; when contrasted against my vast ignorance, these values 
offer excellent proof that citation metrics can be horribly unreliable’. RJ is
also listed among the top-cited scientists in the overall citation database.
