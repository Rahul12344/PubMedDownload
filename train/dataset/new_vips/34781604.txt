BACKGROUND: Chemoprophylaxis (CP) along with masking and physical distancing seem
an undeniable alternative. Considering the significant but uncertain role of CP
for the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, we aimed to determine the various
aspects of CP prescribing practices among physicians across India.
METHODS: An online survey was conducted among prescribing physicians across India
where physicians were assessed for their prescribing practices on COVID-19 CP.
Responses to the questionnaire were obtained via telephone, email and WhatsApp
messages. Responses were duly analyzed thereafter.
RESULT: Ivermectin was the preffered choice in 44% individuals followed by
hydroxychloroquine in 34% individuals. Odds of COVID contact among those using
HCQ and / or IVR prophylaxis was less than 1 of which IVR was found more
protective. The present study also made a survey among 309 community dwellers,
where odds of contacted COVID among those with any prophylaxis was 0.46 times
than those without any prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: The HCPs found IVR to have a greater risk reduction than with HCQ;
while the combination showed the greatest reduction and lack of CP use was
associated with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
