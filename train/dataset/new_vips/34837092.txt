The term multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) encompasses a spectrum of
conditions that share some overlapping clinicopathological manifestations. The
fundamental pathogenetic mechanism involves dysregulated cytokine activity,
causing systemic inflammatory symptoms as well as lymphadenopathy. Some of the
histological changes in lymph nodes resemble the histology of unicentric
Castleman disease (UCD). However, based on current knowledge, the use of this
shared nomenclature is unfortunate, since these disorders differ in pathogenesis 
and prognosis. In Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated MCD,
cytokine overactivity is caused by viral products, which can also lead to
atypical lymphoproliferations and potential progression to lymphoma. In
idiopathic MCD, the hypercytokinemia can result from various mechanisms, which
ultimately lead to different constellations of clinical presentations and varied 
pathology in lymphoid tissues. The authors review the evolving concepts and
definitions of the various conditions under the eponym of multicentric Castleman 
disease.
