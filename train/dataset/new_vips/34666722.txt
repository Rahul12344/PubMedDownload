BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies examining the impact of changes in COVID-19
pandemic-related stressors and experiences, and coping styles on the mental
health trajectory of employed individuals during the lockdown are limited. The
study examined the mental health trajectories of a sample of employed adults in
Hamilton, Ontario during the initial lockdown and after the re-opening following 
the first wave in Canada. Further, this study also identified the
pandemic-related stressors and coping strategies associated with changes in
depressive symptoms in employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: The InHamilton COVID-19 longitudinal study involved 579 employees aged
22-88 years from a large public university in an urban area of Hamilton, Ontario 
at baseline (April 2020). Participants were followed monthly with 6 waves of data
collected between April and November 2020. A growth mixture modeling approach was
used to identify distinct groups of adults who followed a similar pattern of
depressive symptoms over time and to describe the longitudinal change in the
outcome within and among the identified sub-groups.
RESULTS: Our results showed two distinct trajectories of change with 66.2% of
participants displaying low-consistent patterns of depressive symptoms, and 33.8%
of participants displaying high-increasing depressive symptom patterns. COVID-19 
pandemic-related experiences including health concerns, caregiving burden, and
lack of access to resources were associated with worsening of the depressive
symptom trajectories. Frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies and less
frequent use of emotion-focused coping strategies were associated with the high
and increasing depressive symptom pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are
specific to subgroups within the population and stressors may persist and worsen 
over time. Providing access to evidence-informed approaches that foster adaptive 
coping, alleviate the depressive symptoms, and promote the mental health of
working adults is critical.
