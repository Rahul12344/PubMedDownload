Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a
historic pandemic of respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]),
and current evidence suggests that severe disease is associated with dysregulated
immunity within the respiratory tract. However, the innate immune mechanisms that
mediate protection during COVID-19 are not well defined. Here, we characterize a 
mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and find that early CCR2 signaling restricts 
the viral burden in the lung. We find that a recently developed mouse-adapted
SARS-CoV-2 (MA-SARS-CoV-2) strain as well as the emerging B.1.351 variant trigger
an inflammatory response in the lung characterized by the expression of
proinflammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes. Using intravital
antibody labeling, we demonstrate that MA-SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increases
in circulating monocytes and an influx of CD45+ cells into the lung parenchyma
that is dominated by monocyte-derived cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-Seq) analysis of lung homogenates identified a hyperinflammatory monocyte 
profile. We utilize this model to demonstrate that mechanistically, CCR2
signaling promotes the infiltration of classical monocytes into the lung and the 
expansion of monocyte-derived cells. Parenchymal monocyte-derived cells appear to
play a protective role against MA-SARS-CoV-2, as mice lacking CCR2 showed higher 
viral loads in the lungs, increased lung viral dissemination, and elevated
inflammatory cytokine responses. These studies have identified a potential
CCR2-monocyte axis that is critical for promoting viral control and restricting
inflammation within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE
