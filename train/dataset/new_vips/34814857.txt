BACKGROUND: No studies have yet reported the effect of prevention and control
measures, which were implemented to combat COVID-19, on the prevention and
control of common HAIs. We aimed to examine the effect of the "Normalized
Epidemic Prevention and Control Requirements" (implemented in May 2020) by
comparison of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and community-acquired
infections (CAIs) in China during 2018, 2019, and 2020.
METHODS: Data of inpatients before and after implementation of new requirements
were retrospectively analyzed, including infection rate, use of alcohol-based
hand cleaner, anatomical sites of infections, pathogen species, infection by
multi-drug resistant species, and use of different antibiotics.
RESULTS: The HAI rate was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019
(P < 0.05), and the CAI rate was significantly higher in 2019 and 2020 than in
2018 (P < 0.001). Lower respiratory tract infections were the most common HAI
during all years, with no significant changes over time. Lower respiratory tract 
infections were also the most common CAI, but were significantly more common in
2018 and 2019 than 2020 (P < 0.001). There were no changes in upper respiratory
tract infections among HAIs or CAIs. Most HAIs and CAIs were from Gram-negative
bacteria, and the percentages of fungal infections were greater in 2019 and 2020 
than 2018. MRSA infections were more common in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019
(P < 0.05). The utilization rate and usage days of antibiotics decreased over
time (P < 0.001) and the culture rate of microbial specimens before antibiotic
usage increased over time (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The new prevention and control requirements provided important
benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their effects on HAIs were not
obvious.
