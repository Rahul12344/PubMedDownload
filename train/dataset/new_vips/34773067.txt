To initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) on the viral 
spike protein must first bind to the host receptor ACE2 protein on pulmonary and 
other ACE2-expressing cells. We hypothesized that cardiac glycoside drugs might
block the binding reaction between ACE2 and the Spike (S) protein, and thus block
viral penetration into target cells. To test this hypothesis we developed a
biochemical assay for ACE2:Spike binding, and tested cardiac glycosides as
inhibitors of binding. Here we report that ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin, as
well as sugar-free derivatives digitoxigenin and digoxigenin, are high-affinity
competitive inhibitors of ACE2 binding to the Original [D614] S1 and the α/β/γ
[D614G] S1 proteins. These drugs also inhibit ACE2 binding to the Original RBD,
as well as to RBD proteins containing the β [E484K], Mink [Y453F] and α/β/γ
[N501Y] mutations. As hypothesized, we also found that ouabain, digitoxin and
digoxin blocked penetration by SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus into human lung
cells, and infectivity by native SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that cardiac
glycosides may block viral penetration into the target cell by first inhibiting
ACE2:RBD binding. Clinical concentrations of ouabain and digitoxin are relatively
safe for short term use for subjects with normal hearts. It has therefore not
escaped our attention that these common cardiac medications could be deployed
worldwide as inexpensive repurposed drugs for anti-COVID-19 therapy.
