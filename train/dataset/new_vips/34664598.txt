Nowadays pigs are bred with artificial insemination to reduce costs and
transportation. To prevent the spread of diseases, it is important to test semen 
samples for viruses. Screening techniques applied are enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays and/or polymerase chain reaction, which are labor-intensive and expensive 
methods. In contrast to the current used screening techniques, it is possible to 
remove viruses physically from semen. However, existing methods for virus removal
techniques have a low yield of spermatozoa. Therefore, we have developed a
microfluidic chip that performs size-based separation of viruses and spermatozoa 
in boar semen samples, thereby having the potential to reduce the risk of disease
spreading in the context of artificial insemination in the veterinary industry.
As the head of a spermatozoon is at least twenty times larger than a virus
particle, the particle size can be used to achieve separation, resulting in a
semen sample with lower viral load and of higher quality. To achieve the size
separation, our microfluidic device is based on pinched-flow fractionation. A
model virus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, was used and spiked to porcine semen 
samples. With the proposed microfluidic chip and the optimized flow parameters,
at least 84 ± 4% of the model viruses were removed from the semen. The remaining 
virus contamination is caused by the model virus adhering to spermatozoa instead 
of the separation technique. The spermatozoa recovery was 86 ± 6%, which is an
enormous improvement in yield compared to existing virus removal techniques.
