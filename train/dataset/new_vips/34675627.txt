Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 is a quickly developing global health crisis, yet the mechanisms of
pathogenesis in COVID-19 are not fully understood.
Methods: The RNA sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was obtained from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), 
long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), and microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified by
edgeR, and the SARS-CoV-2-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was
constructed based on the prediction of bioinformatic databases. The Gene Ontology
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment
analyses were conducted with the SARS-CoV-2-related DEmRNAs, and the
protein-protein interaction network was also built basing on STRING database. The
ROC analysis was performed for assessing the diagnostic efficiency of hub genes.
Results: The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2-related DEmRNAs were associated
with the interferon signaling pathway and other antiviral processes, such as
IFNL3, IFNL1 and CH25H. Our analysis suggested that lncRNA NEAT1 might regulate
the host immune response through two miRNAs, hsa-miR-374-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p,
which control the expression of SOCS1, IL6, IL1B, CSF1R, CD274, TLR6, and TNF.
Additionally, IFI6, HRASLS2, IGFBP4 and PTN may be potential targets based on an 
analysis comparing the transcriptional responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection with
that of other respiratory viruses.
Discussion: The unique ceRNA network identified potential non-coding RNAs and
their possible targets as well as a new perspective to understand the molecular
mechanisms of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This study may also aid in 
the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
