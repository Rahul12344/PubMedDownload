Recently, bovine enterovirus (BEV) has caused several respiratory and
gastrointestinal diseases outbreaks in cattle. Monitoring the epidemiological and
pathogenic characteristics of this virus is crucial to controlling its spread. We
isolated a BEV strain with typical cytopathic effects from the faeces of cows
with significant diarrhoeal symptoms in China and observed the viral particles
within 20-30 nm through transmission electron microscopy. Then, we designated
this strain as HB19-1 in this study. The multistep growth curves showed that the 
virus propagated well in the MDBK cells. Molecular genetic analysis of VP1
indicated that HB19-1 belonged to the BEV-F1 group. Although the challenged ICR
mice did not exhibit typical disease symptoms in animal infection assay, we
observed significant pathological damage in the lungs, intestines, and muscle
tissues. In summary, we isolated a BEV strain HB19-1 causing severe diarrhoea in 
cattle and proposed reinforcing the epidemiological surveillance of this virus.
