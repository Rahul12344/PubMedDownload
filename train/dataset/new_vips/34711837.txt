Emerging viral diseases of plants are recognised as a growing threat to global
food security. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes and
ecological factors underlying the emergence and success of viruses that have
caused past epidemics. With technological advances in the field of ancient
genomics, it is now possible to sequence historical genomes to provide a better
understanding of viral plant disease emergence and pathogen evolutionary history.
In this context, herbarium specimens represent a valuable source of dated and
preserved material. We report here the first historical genome of a crop pathogen
DNA virus, a 90-year-old African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), reconstructed from 
small RNA sequences bearing hallmarks of small interfering RNAs. Relative to
tip-calibrated dating inferences using only modern data, those performed with the
historical genome yielded both molecular evolution rate estimates that were
significantly lower, and lineage divergence times that were significantly older. 
Crucially, divergence times estimated without the historical genome appeared in
discordance with both historical disease reports and the existence of the
historical genome itself. In conclusion, our study reports an updated time-frame 
for the history and evolution of ACMV and illustrates how the study of crop viral
diseases could benefit from natural history collections.
