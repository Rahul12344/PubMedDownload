The Rab GTPase family contains almost 70 genes in the human genome and acts as
the key regulator of intracellular membrane trafficking in human cells. The
dysregulation of Rab GTPase has been shown to be associated with multiple human
diseases, ranging from neurodegeneration, and infection to cancer. Rab GTPases
not only play important roles in genome replication, morphogenesis and the
release of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), but also
contribute to hepatitis-related hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) progression. The alteration of Rab GTPase expression in HCC plays an
important role in tumour cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Notably, the
expression of Rab genes can be regulated by some noncoding RNAs, such as miRNAs
and circRNAs. Thus, Rab GTPases can serve as promising rational and therapeutic
targets for HCC treatments. In this review, we summarized recent advancements in 
this field focusing on Rab GTPases in HCC.
