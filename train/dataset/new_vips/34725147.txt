In addition to being required for protein synthesis, ribosomes and ribosomal
proteins (RPs) also regulate messenger RNA translation in uninfected and
virus-infected cells. By individually depleting 85 RPs using RNA interference, we
found that overall protein synthesis in uninfected primary fibroblasts was more
sensitive to RP depletion than those infected with herpes simplex virus-1
(HSV-1). Although representative RP depletion (uL3, uS4, uL5) inhibited protein
synthesis in cells infected with two different DNA viruses (human
cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus), HSV-1-infected cell protein synthesis
unexpectedly endured and required a single virus-encoded gene product, VP22.
During individual RP insufficiency, VP22-expressing HSV-1 replicated better than 
a VP22-deficient variant. Furthermore, VP22 promotes polysome accumulation in
virus-infected cells when uL3 or ribosome availability is limiting and
cosediments with initiating and elongating ribosomes in infected and uninfected
cells. This identifies VP22 as a virus-encoded, ribosome-associated protein that 
compensates for RP insufficiency to support viral protein synthesis and
replication. Moreover, it reveals an unanticipated class of virus-encoded,
ribosome-associated effectors that reduce the dependence of protein synthesis
upon host RPs and broadly support translation during physiological stress such as
infection.
