Background and objectives: Ambulatory (outpatient) healthcare organizations
continue to respond to the COVID-19 global pandemic using an array of initiatives
to sustain a continuity of palliative care. Continuance of palliative care during
major crises has been previously accomplished; however, the global pandemic
presents new challenges to the US healthcare industry. Materials and methods:
This systematic review queried four research databases to identify applicable
studies related to the provision of palliative care during the pandemic in
outpatient organizations within the United States. Results: There are two primary
facilitators for the ongoing provision of palliative care for the outpatient
segment of the United States healthcare industry: technology and advanced care
planning. Researchers also identified two primary barriers in the outpatient
setting impacting the continuance of palliative care: lack of resources and
accessibility to care. Conclusions: This systematic review identified
facilitators and barriers for palliative care initiatives in the United States
that can further assist future outpatient (ambulatory care) providers at a global
level as the pandemic and associated public health initiatives continue.
