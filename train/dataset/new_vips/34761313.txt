PURPOSE: The considerable volume of infections from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has made it challenging for health
departments to collect complete data for national disease reporting. We sought to
examine sensitivity of the COVID-19 case report form (CRF) pregnancy field by
comparing CRF data to the gold standard of CRF data linked to birth and fetal
death certificates.
DESCRIPTION: CRFs for women aged 15-44 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection were linked to birth and fetal death certificates for pregnancies
completed during January 1-December 31, 2020 in Illinois and Tennessee. Among
linked records, pregnancy was considered confirmed for women with a SARS-CoV-2
specimen collection date on or prior to the delivery date. Sensitivity of the
COVID-19 CRF pregnancy field was calculated by dividing the number of confirmed
pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection with pregnancy indicated on the CRF by
the number of confirmed pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
ASSESSMENT: Among 4276 (Illinois) and 2070 (Tennessee) CRFs that linked with a
birth or fetal death certificate, CRF pregnancy field sensitivity was 45.3% and
42.1%, respectively. In both states, sensitivity varied significantly by maternal
race/ethnicity, insurance, trimester of prenatal care entry, month of specimen
collection, and trimester of specimen collection. Sensitivity also varied by
maternal education in Illinois but not in Tennessee.
CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of the COVID-19 CRF pregnancy field varied by state and
demographic factors. To more accurately assess outcomes for pregnant women,
jurisdictions might consider utilizing additional data sources and linkages to
obtain pregnancy status.
