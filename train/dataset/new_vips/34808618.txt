BACKGROUND: Data regarding the influence of patatin-like phospholipase
domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) polymorphism for patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) 
are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the role of the PNPLA3 polymorphism for the
development of LC and its complications by the findings of genetic examinations.
METHODS: Patients with LC caused by virus (n = 157), alcohol (n = 104),
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 106), or autoimmune disease (n =
33) and without LC (n = 128) were enrolled. LC were composed of the present and
absent of complications, such as variceal bleeding, hepatic ascites, and/or
hepatic encephalopathy. To assess the role of the PNPLA3 polymorphism, odds ratio
(OR) for the rs738409 variant was calculated for the patients between (i) with LC
and without LC in the entire cohort, and (ii) the present and absent of
complications in the patients with LC.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference among the patients without LC and
those with alcohol, NAFLD related LC in the frequency of G alleles (p < 0.001,
both). According to complications of LC, the OR for NAFLD related cirrhosis
significantly increased in the presence of the two mutated alleles (OR = 3.165; p
= 0.046) when the wild type was used as the reference. However, there were no
significant risks for the complications in the virus and alcohol related
cirrhosis unless there was a presence of G alleles.
CONCLUSION: The PNPLA3 polymorphism was associated with the risk of NAFLD related
LC and its complications.
