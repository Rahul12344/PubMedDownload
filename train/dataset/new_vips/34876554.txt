Viral infection triggers activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). In
response to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)
phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2, converting it from a
translation initiator into a potent translation inhibitor and this restricts the 
synthesis of viral proteins. Phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2-P) inhibits translation by
binding to eIF2's dedicated, heterodecameric nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and
conformationally inactivating it. We show that the NSs protein of Sandfly Fever
Sicilian virus (SFSV) allows the virus to evade the ISR. Mechanistically, NSs
tightly binds to eIF2B (KD = 30 nM), blocks eIF2-P binding, and rescues eIF2B GEF
activity. Cryo-EM structures demonstrate that SFSV NSs and eIF2-P directly
compete, with the primary NSs contacts to eIF2Bα mediated by five 'aromatic
fingers'. NSs binding preserves eIF2B activity by maintaining eIF2B's
conformation in its active A-State.
