Biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(b/tsDMARDs) have long been recognized to cause hepatitis B virus (HBV)
reactivation in individuals chronically infected with or previously exposed to
HBV.1 Despite this knowledge, many patients treated with b/tsDMARDs experience
HBV reactivation each year because of inconsistent screening.2.
