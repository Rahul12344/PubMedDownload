Historically, vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been a thorn in the side of public
health efforts to contain and eradicate infectious diseases. This phenomenon is
magnified in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Surveys conducted across South Africa since the outbreak of COVID-19 demonstrate 
the complexity of factors that contribute towards VH in this population. Amidst
the negative press that the COVID-19 vaccine has received, especially across
social media, understanding and combatting VH remains important to achieve herd
immunity. This article aims to shed light on key factors fuelling COVID-19 VH in 
South Africa and provides a framework from which to address this problem.
