Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to approximately 10%-15% 
of lymphomas diagnosed in the USA, including a small percentage of Natural Killer
(NK)/T cell lymphomas, which are clinically aggressive, respond poorly to
chemotherapy and have a shorter survival. Here, we present a case of a patient
found to have EBV-induced NK/T cell lymphoma from a chronic EBV infection. While 
the EBV most commonly infects B cells, it can infect NK/T cells, and it is
important for the clinician to be aware of the potential transformation to
lymphoma as it is clinically aggressive, warranting early recognition and
treatment. NK/T cell lymphoma is a unique type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is 
almost always associated with EBV. The disease predominantly localises in the
upper aerodigestive tract, most commonly in the nose.
