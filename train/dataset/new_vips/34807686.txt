Adolescence is a critical period for social development, which COVID-19 has
dramatically altered. Quarantined youths had limited in-person interactions with 
peers. The present study used an intensive longitudinal design to investigate
changes in interpersonal dynamics and mental health during COVID-19.
Specifically, we investigated whether the associations between different social
contexts-that is, "spillover"-changed during COVID-19 and whether changes in
social interactions during COVID-19 was associated with changes in depressive
symptoms. Approximately 1 year prior to the onset of COVID-19, 139 youths
reported depressive symptoms and daily interactions with parents, siblings, and
friends, every day for 21 days via online questionnaires. Shortly after schools
closed due to COVID-19, 115 of these youths completed a similar 28-day diary.
Analyses included 112 youths (62 girls; 73% Caucasian; Mage = 11.77, range = 8 to
15 in Wave 1) who completed at least 13 diary days in each data wave. Our results
show that younger adolescents experienced significant decreases in negative and
positive interactions with friends, whereas older adolescents showed significant 
decreases in negative interactions with friends and significant increases in
positive interactions with siblings. As predicted, within-day spillover of
positive interactions and person-level association of negative interactions
increased within the family during COVID-19, whereas within-day spillover of
positive interactions between family and friends decreased. We also found a
dramatic increase in depressive symptoms. More negative interactions and fewer
positive interactions with family members were associated with changes in
depressive symptoms. Our study sheds light on how youths' social development may 
be impacted by COVID-19. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights
