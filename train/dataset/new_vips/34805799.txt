The importance of the G-protein βγ subunits in the regulation of cargo transport 
from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane (PM) is well accepted; 
however, the molecular mechanism underlying the G-protein activation at the TGN
remains unclear. We show here that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors at the
PM were trafficked to the TGN in response to a surface transport cargo,
temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein tagged with green
fluorescent protein accumulation in the Golgi. The receptor internalization
occurred in an S1P-independent manner but required phosphorylation by G-protein
receptor kinase 2 and β-arrestin association before internalization. Continuously
activated S1P receptors in a manner dependent on S1P at the TGN kept transmitting
G-protein signals including the βγ subunits supply necessary for transport
carrier formation at the TGN destined for the PM.
