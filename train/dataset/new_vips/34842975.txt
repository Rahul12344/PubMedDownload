BACKGROUND: The establishment of a risk-appropriate care approach for pregnant
women and newborn infants under the COVID-19 pneumonia is vital to prevent the
main pregnancy complications.
OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: This study reviewed the vertical transmission (VT)
potential of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women. Key-related symptoms and
adverse clinical outcomes for mothers and infants before and after childbirth
were summarized. Some practical therapies and preventive health solutions were
also proposed.
RESULTS: There was a high susceptibility in pregnant women to COVID-19 infection,
especially in the third trimester of pregnancy. The most common symptoms in
22-40-year-old patients infected with COVID-19 were fever (87.6%), cough (52.3%),
dyspnea (27.6%), fatigue (22.4%), sore throat (13.5%), malaise (9.4%), and
diarrhea (3.4%), respectively. The viral infection led to an increase in preterm 
labor and cesarean delivery without any intrauterine infection and severe
neonatal asphyxia. No infection in the newborn infants was reported despite a
high risk of the VT phenomenon. The most important therapies were the reception
of antiviral and antibiotic drugs, oxygenation therapy, psychological
interventions, and food supplements with health-promoting effects. The best
proposed medical strategies to control the COVID-19 infection were bi-monthly
screening and following-up the mothers' and fetuses' health, not using the potent
broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, providing the delivery room with 
negative pressure for emergency cesarean section, and the immediate isolation of 
newborns after childbirth without direct breastfeeding.
CONCLUSION: Babies with respiratory problems may be born to some mothers with
COVID-19, who have weak immune systems. Thus, the virus transmission cycle should
be disrupted to prevent adverse maternal and fetal outcomes by integrating
individual health guidelines, efficient medical care therapies, and hospital
preventive practices.
