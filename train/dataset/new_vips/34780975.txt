Probiotics are widely used in aquafeeds and exhibited beneficial effects on fish 
by improving host health and resisting pathogens. However, probiotics applied to 
aquaculture are mainly from terrestrial sources instead of the host animal. The
purpose of the work was to evaluate the effects of stabilized fermentation
product of commensal Cetobacterium somerae XMX-1 on gut, liver health and
antiviral immunity of zebrafish. A total of 240 zebrafish were assigned to the
control (fed a basal diet) and XMX-1 group (fed a basal diet with 10 g XMX-1/kg
diet). After four weeks feeding, growth performance, feed utilization, hepatic
steatosis score, TAG, lipid metabolism related genes and serum ALT were
evaluated. Furthermore, serum LPS, the expression of Hif-1α, intestinal
inflammation score, antioxidant capability and gut microbiota were tested. The
survival rate and the expression of antiviral genes were analyzed after challenge
by spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). Results showed that dietary XMX-1 did not
affect growth of zebrafish. However, dietary XMX-1 significantly decreased the
level of serum LPS, intestinal inflammation score and intestinal MDA, as well as 
increased T-AOC and the expression of Hif-1α in zebrafish intestine (p < 0.05).
Furthermore, XMX-1 supplementation decreased the relative abundance of
Proteobacteria and increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Additionally, XMX-1
supplementation significantly decreased hepatic steatosis score, hepatic TAG,
serum ALT and increased the expression of lipolysis genes versus control
(p < 0.05). Zebrafish fed XMX-1 diet exhibited higher survival rate after SVCV
challenge. Consistently, dietary XMX-1 fermentation product increased the
expression of IFNφ2 and IFNφ3 after 2 days of SVCV challenge and the expression
of IFNφ1, IFNφ2 and MxC after 4 days of SVCV challenge in the spleen in zebrafish
versus control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our results indicate that dietary XMX-1
can improve liver and gut health, while enhancing antiviral immunity of
zebrafish.
