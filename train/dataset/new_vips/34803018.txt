The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a major health crisis affecting
the several nations. In particular, the high ratio of COVID-19 pandemic in
Pakistan is significantly deteriorating human mental as well as physical health. 
The huge mental and physical loss has taught several lessons, which have been
retrieved from already existing literature. The latest researches were consulted 
to identify the challenges and solution to combat COVID-19. First of all, the
pharmacy communities in Pakistan are not sufficient to handle the burden of
COVID-19 due to economic issues. However, the Government should provide
interest-free loans to students and researchers for conducting scholarly work for
manufacturing advance medication to combat against COVID-19. Secondly, the drugs 
that have been used to control the spread of COVID-19, found to be associated
with the development of a neuropsychiatric complication. Therefore, there is a
dire need to develop more mental health services to control the medication side
effects. Thirdly as the traditional mental health services are not sufficient to 
provide effective and advanced mental health services, therefore, transformative 
changes through community psychology are mandatory to implement. Lastly, as
communicable disease limit the geographical access to avail mental health
services. Therefore, the e-CBT approaches must be provided to mitigate the pre
and post-pandemic effects. The findings of the study would provide the direction 
for preparing to combat communicable diseases in the future.
