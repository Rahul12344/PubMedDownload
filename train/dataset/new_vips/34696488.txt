Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal mucosal pathogen that infects the
ciliated respiratory epithelium and results in the most severe morbidity in the
first six months of life. RSV is a common cause of acute respiratory infection
during infancy and is an important early-life risk factor strongly associated
with asthma development. While this association has been repeatedly demonstrated,
limited progress has been made on the mechanistic understanding in humans of the 
contribution of infant RSV infection to airway epithelial dysfunction. An active 
infection of epithelial cells with RSV in vitro results in heightened central
metabolism and overall hypermetabolic state; however, little is known about
whether natural infection with RSV in vivo results in lasting metabolic
reprogramming of the airway epithelium in infancy. To address this gap, we
performed functional metabolomics, 13C glucose metabolic flux analysis, and
RNA-seq gene expression analysis of nasal airway epithelial cells (NAECs) sampled
from infants between 2-3 years of age, with RSV infection or not during the first
year of life. We found that RSV infection in infancy was associated with lasting 
epithelial metabolic reprogramming, which was characterized by (1) significant
increase in glucose uptake and differential utilization of glucose by epithelium;
(2) altered preferences for metabolism of several carbon and energy sources; and 
(3) significant sexual dimorphism in metabolic parameters, with RSV-induced
metabolic changes most pronounced in male epithelium. In summary, our study
supports the proposed phenomenon of metabolic reprogramming of epithelial cells
associated with RSV infection in infancy and opens exciting new venues for
pursuing mechanisms of RSV-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction in early life.
