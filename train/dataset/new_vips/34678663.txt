Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) is a heart disorder caused by a loss-of-function
mutation in the KCNH2 gene that is an essential factor in cardiac repolarization 
and affects the heart rate. This study has generated a human-induced stem cell
line (KSCBi014-A) carrying the KCNH2 (c.453delC) mutation from an LQT2 patient.
The non-integrative Sendai virus-mediated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
reprogramming method was used for iPSC line generation. The KSCBi014-A line
maintained stem cell-like morphology, normal karyotype, and pluripotency, and
could differentiate into three germ layers in vitro.
