A novel phage vB_VpP_DE17, which infects Vibrio parahaemolyticus, was isolated
from the sewer of the Huangsha aquatic market in Guangzhou. Transmission electron
microscopy indicated that DE17 had an icosahedral head (47 ± 2 nm diameter) and a
short, non-contractile tail (17 ± 2 nm). The genome of DE17 was a double-stranded
linear DNA with a length of 43,397 bp and GC content of 49.23%. In total, 49
putative open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted and could be divided into six 
modules: DNA metabolism, lysis, packaging, structure, additional function, and
hypothetical proteins. Taxonomic analysis revealed that the phage belonging to
the genus of Maculvirus, Autographivirinae subfamily, Podoviridae family. DE17
had a short latent period of 5 min with burst size of 80 pfu/cell. Its optimum
temperature and pH ranges were 4 °C-50 °C and 5-10, respectively; it was
completely inactivated after 20 min of ultraviolet irradiation. No transfer RNA
(tRNA), virulence associated, or antibiotic resistance genes were identified.
Bacterial challenge test revealed that DE17 had a certain inhibitory effect on V.
parahaemolyticus within 6 h. Characterization, genomic analysis and in vitro
antibacterial assays of DE17 will further enhance our understanding of phage
biology and diversity.
