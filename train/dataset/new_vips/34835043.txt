The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid and its disassembly, or
capsid uncoating, has remained an active area of study over the past several
decades. Our understanding of the HIV-1 capsid as solely a protective shell has
since shifted with discoveries linking it to other complex replication events.
The interplay of the HIV-1 capsid with reverse transcription, nuclear import, and
integration has led to an expansion of knowledge of capsid functionality.
Coincident with advances in microscopy, cell, and biochemistry assays, several
models of capsid disassembly have been proposed, in which it occurs in either the
cytoplasmic, nuclear envelope, or nuclear regions of the cell. Here, we discuss
how the understanding of the HIV-1 capsid has evolved and the key methods that
made these discoveries possible.
