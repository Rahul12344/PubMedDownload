Background The neonatal heart maintains its entire regeneration capacity within
days after birth. Using quantitative phosphoproteomics technology, we identified 
that SGK3 (serine/threonine-protein kinase 3) in the neonatal heart is highly
expressed and activated after myocardial infarction. This study aimed to uncover 
the function and related mechanisms of SGK3 on cardiomyocyte proliferation and
cardiac repair after apical resection or ischemia/reperfusion injury. Methods and
Results The effect of SGK3 on proliferation and oxygen glucose
deprivation/reoxygenation- induced apoptosis in isolated cardiomyocytes was
evaluated using cardiomyocyte-specific SGK3 overexpression or knockdown
adenovirus5 vector. In vivo, gain- and loss-of-function experiments using
cardiomyocyte-specific adeno-associated virus 9 were performed to determine the
effect of SGK3 in cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair after apical
resection or ischemia/reperfusion injury. In vitro, overexpression of SGK3
enhanced, whereas knockdown of SGK3 decreased, the cardiomyocyte proliferation
ratio. In vivo, inhibiting the expression of SGK3 shortened the time window of
cardiac regeneration after apical resection in neonatal mice, and overexpression 
of SGK3 significantly promoted myocardial repair and cardiac function recovery
after ischemia/reperfusion injury in adult mice. Mechanistically, SGK3 promoted
cardiomyocyte regeneration and myocardial repair after cardiac injury by
inhibiting GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β) activity and upregulating
β-catenin expression. SGK3 also upregulated the expression of cell cycle
promoting genes G1/S-specific cyclin-D1, c-myc (cellular-myelocytomatosis viral
oncogene), and cdc20 (cell division cycle 20), but downregulated the expression
of cell cycle negative regulators cyclin kinase inhibitor P 21 and cyclin kinase 
inhibitor P 27. Conclusions Our study reveals a key role of SGK3 on cardiac
repair after apical resection or ischemia/reperfusion injury, which may reopen a 
novel therapeutic option for myocardial infarction.
