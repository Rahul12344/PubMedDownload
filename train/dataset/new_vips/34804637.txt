Background and Objective: Obstetric fistula affects approximately 2 million women
worldwide, predominantly in places with a high Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
burden. In Malawi, where thousands of women live with fistulas, HIV prevalence is
11-13%. Although repair is usually successful, surgical outcomes among
immunocompromised women are poorly understood. Inconsistent guidelines regarding 
the Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) threshold necessary for repair make it
difficult for surgeons to make informed decisions. This study compares the
postoperative outcomes of women undergoing obstetric fistula repair with and
without HIV, stratified by CD4 count.
Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study using a database of women who
underwent vesicovaginal fistula repair at the Fistula Care Center from 2010-2018.
HIV-positive participants, stratified by CD4<350 and CD4>350, were matched to
HIV-negative controls by age within 5 years and Goh classification. Controls were
matched to cases in a 3:1 ratio. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were 
conducted on indicators based on HIV status and CD4 count stratification.
Outcomes included dye test results, pad weights, and continence status at 2 weeks
post-repair.
Results: 54 seropositive women were matched to 135 seronegative women. Of the 54 
HIV positive women, 22.2% (n=12) had a CD4 count < 350. We found no statistically
significant difference in surgical outcomes between HIV-positive and negative
patients. 93.5% of HIV positive and 90% of HIV negative women healed completely. 
In our sub-analysis of 12 seropositive women with CD4<350, we found a statically 
significant difference in successful closure, with 25% of women with CD4<350
having a positive dye test indicating incomplete closure, compared to 2.8% of
women with CD4>350 (p=0.024).
Conclusion and Global Health Implications: Our analysis confirms previous
research indicating that seropositive women with a CD4>350 can safely undergo
obstetric fistula repair. Further research is needed to evaluate postoperative
outcomes among women with CD4<350.
