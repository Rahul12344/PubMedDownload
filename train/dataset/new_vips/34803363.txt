We have performed a three-dimensional numerical simulation to determine the
effect of local atmospheric pollution level on the spreading characteristics of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus through
ejected droplets during sneezing and coughing in an open space. Utilizing a
finite volume-based numerical method, we have performed computations for various 
ranges of droplet diameters and sneezing speeds. The interactions between the
droplets and the suspended particles are considered by taking both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic wettability characteristics into account. Our computational
results show that the virus-containing droplets partially affect aerosols during 
the path of their transmission. With the progression of time, the droplet
distribution shows an asymmetric pattern. The maximum dispersion of these
droplets is found for higher sneezing velocities. The droplets with a diameter of
50 μm travel a larger distance than the larger diameter droplets. We have found
that an aerosol with hydrophilic wettability undergoes complete wetting by the
disease-containing droplets and therefore is conducive to disease propagation.
The droplet engagement duration with aerosol decreases with increase in the
sneezing velocity. Our study recommends against using physical exercise centers
in a closed environment such as gymnasium and indoor games during the COVID
pandemic, especially in a polluted environment. The results from our work will
help in deciding proper social distancing guidelines based on the local
atmospheric pollution level. They may act as a precursor in controlling further
spread of diseases during this unprecedented situation of the COVID pandemic.
