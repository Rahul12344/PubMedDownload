Effective interventions for increasing people's intention to get vaccinated are
crucial for global health, especially considering COVID-19. We devised a novel
intervention using virtual reality (VR) consisting of a consultation with a
general practitioner for communicating the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and, 
in turn, increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We
conducted a preregistered online experiment with a 2×2 between-participant
design. People with eligible VR headsets were invited to install our experimental
application and complete the ten minute virtual consultation study at their own
discretion. Participants were randomly assigned across two age conditions (young 
or old self-body) and two communication conditions (with provision of personal
benefit of vaccination only, or collective and personal benefit). The primary
outcome was vaccination intention (score range 1-100) measured three times:
immediately before and after the study, as well as one week later.
Five-hundred-and-seven adults not vaccinated against COVID-19 were recruited.
Among the 282 participants with imperfect vaccination intentions (<100), the VR
intervention increased pre-to-post vaccination intentions across intervention
conditions (mean difference 8.6, 95% CI 6.1 to 11.1,p<0.0001). The pre-to-post
difference significantly correlated with the vaccination intention one week
later, ρ=0.20,p<0.0001. The VR intervention was effective in increasing COVID-19 
vaccination intentions both when only personal benefits and personal and
collective benefits of vaccination were communicated, with significant retention 
one week after the intervention. Utilizing recent evidence from health psychology
and embodiment research to develop immersive environments with customized and
salient communication efforts could therefore be an effective tool to complement 
public health campaigns.
