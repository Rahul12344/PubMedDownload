BACKGROUND: The relation between the magnitude of successive waves of the
COVID-19 outbreak within the same communities could be useful in predicting the
scope of new outbreaks.
METHODS: We investigated the extent to which COVID-19 mortality in Italy during
the second wave was related to first wave mortality within the same provinces. We
compared data on province-specific COVID-19 2020 mortality in two time periods,
corresponding to the first wave (February 24-June 30, 2020) and to the second
wave (September 1-December 31, 2020), using cubic spline regression.
RESULTS: For provinces with the lowest crude mortality rate in the first wave
(February-June), i.e. < 22 cases/100,000/month, mortality in the second wave
(September-December) was positively associated with mortality during the first
wave. In provinces with mortality greater than 22/100,000/month during the first 
wave, higher mortality in the first wave was associated with a lower second wave 
mortality. Results were similar when the analysis was censored at October 2020,
before the implementation of region-specific measures against the outbreak.
Neither vaccination nor variant spread had any role during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that provinces with the most severe initial 
COVID-19 outbreaks, as assessed through mortality data, faced milder second
waves.
