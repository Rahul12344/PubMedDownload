Objective: To predict the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) based on magnetic resonance (MR) radiomics and
clinical nomograms prior to NACT.
Materials and Methods: From January 2014 to July 2015, 284 consecutive patients
with pathologically confirmed NPC underwent 3.0 T MR imaging (MRI) before
initiating NACT. The patients' data were randomly assigned to a training set (n =
200) or a test set (n = 84) at a ratio of 7:3. The clinical data included sex,
tumor (T) stage, lymph node (N) stage, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
stage, and the plasma concentration of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. The regions 
of interest (ROI) were manually segmented on the axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI)
and enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) sequences using ITK-SNAP software. The
radiomics data were post-processed using AK software. Moreover, the Maximum
Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the Least Absolute Shrinkage
and Selection Operator (LASSO) were adopted for dimensionality reduction to
screen for the features that best predicted the treatment efficacy, and clinical 
risk factors were used in combination with radiomics scores (Rad-scores) to
construct the clinical radiomics-based nomogram. DeLong's test was utilized to
compare the area under the curve (AUC) values of the clinical radiomics-based
nomogram, radiomics model, and clinical nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA)
was employed to evaluate each model's net benefit.
Results: The clinical nomogram was constructed based on data from patients who
were randomly assigned according to T2WI and enhanced T1WI sequences. In the
training set, the T2WI sequence-based clinical radiomics nomogram and the
radiomics model outperformed the clinical nomogram in predicting the NACT
efficacy (AUC, 0.81 vs. 0.60, p = 0.001279 and 0.76 vs. 0.60, p = 0.03026). These
findings were well-verified in the test set. The enhanced T1WI sequence-based
clinical radiomics nomogram exhibited better performance in predicting treatment 
efficacy than the clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.79 vs. 0.62, respectively; p =
0.0000834). The DCA revealed that the T2WI and clinical radiomics-based nomograms
resulted in a net benefit in predicting the NACT efficacy.
Conclusion: The clinical radiomics-based nomogram improved the prediction of NACT
efficacy, with the T2WI sequence-based clinical radiomics achieving the best
effect.
