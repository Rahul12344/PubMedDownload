Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infects humans and
dromedary camels and is responsible for an ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory
illness in humans in the Middle East. Although some mutations found in
camel-derived MERS-CoV strains have been characterized, most natural variation
found across MERS-CoV isolates remains unstudied. We report on the environmental 
stability, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of
MERS-CoV, as well as isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. Although most
MERS-CoV isolates had similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the
camel-derived isolate C/KSA/13 had reduced surface stability, and another camel
isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model. These
results suggest that although betacoronaviruses might have similar environmental 
stability profiles, individual variation can influence this phenotype,
underscoring the need for continual global viral surveillance.
