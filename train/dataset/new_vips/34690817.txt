Although Flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) virus are important
human pathogens, an effective vaccine or antiviral treatment against them is not 
available. Hence, the search for new strategies to control flavivirus infections 
is essential. Several studies have shown that the host lipid metabolism could be 
an antiviral target because cholesterol and other lipids are required during the 
replicative cycle of different Flaviviridae family members. FDA-approved drugs
with hypolipidemic effects could be an alternative for treating flavivirus
infections. However, a better understanding of the regulation between host lipid 
metabolism and signaling pathways triggered during these infections is required. 
The metabolic pathways related to lipid metabolism modified during DENV and ZIKV 
infection are analyzed in this review. Additionally, the role of lipid-lowering
drugs as safe host-targeted antivirals is discussed.
