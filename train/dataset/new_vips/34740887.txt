Point-of-care tests for SARS-CoV-2 could enable rapid rule-in and/or rule-out of 
COVID-19, allowing rapid and accurate patient cohorting and potentially reducing 
the risk of nosocomial transmission. As COVID-19 begins to circulate with other
more common respiratory viruses, there is a need for rapid diagnostics to help
clinicians test for multiple potential causative organisms
simultaneously.However, the different technologies available have strengths and
weaknesses that must be understood to ensure that they are used to the benefit of
the patient and healthcare system. Device performance is related to the deployed 
context, and the diagnostic characteristics may be affected by user
experience.This practice review is written by members of the UK's COVID-19
National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation programme. We discuss relative merits
and test characteristics of various commercially available technologies. We do
not advocate for any given test, and our coverage of commercially supplied tests 
is not intended to be exhaustive.
