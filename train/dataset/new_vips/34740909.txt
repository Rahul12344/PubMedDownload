Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterised by isolated
thrombocytopenia which may be idiopathic or due to a secondary aetiology. ITP is 
being increasingly recognised secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the current
pandemic. Here, we report a case of a five-and-a-half-year-old female child on
maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who subsequently
developed ITP secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient had prolonged
thrombocytopenia secondary to ITP, requiring the use of second-line agents
including romiplostim and eltrombopag. This is a unique case where ITP was
recognised secondary to SARS-CoV-2. In such cases of thrombocytopenia, ITP should
be considered as an important differential in addition to relapse of leukaemia or
thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy drugs.
