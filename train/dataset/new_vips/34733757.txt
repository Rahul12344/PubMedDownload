Introduction: Genital condylomatosis is a highly contagious disease caused by the
human papilloma virus (HPV). The aim of this prospective multicentre study was to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Holmium:YAG (yttrium-aluminium-garnet)
laser in the treatment of genital and intra-urethral warts; the secondary aim was
to assess the patients' postoperative satisfaction and cosmetic results. Methods:
From December 2016 to March 2019, patients with genital warts were prospectively 
enrolled in three hospitals. The inclusion criteria were male gender, age over 18
years-old and treatment-naïve. External and urethral genitalia warts were treated
by the Holmium YAG laser. The follow-up analysis consisted of physical
examination, flexible urethro-cystoscopy in case of meatal lesions, and
administration of Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) and Patient Global
Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after
surgery and subsequently yearly. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled. The
single treatment was effective in 57/60 patients (95%). At a mean follow-up of 26
months, recurrences occurred in 8 patients (13.3%). No peri- or post-operative
complication occurred. An improvement in pre-operative condition was highlighted 
with PGI-I and DLQI questionnaires. Conclusion: Our prospective multicentre study
showed that holmium laser surgery seems to be a safe and effective treatment for 
external genital and urethral warts. Good dermatological outcomes aid to further 
improve patient satisfaction.
