Background: Hepatitis C virus, a silent killer, has infected 71 million people
globally. The recombinant viral antigenic proteins might be used in the early
diagnosis of HCV infection. The NS3 and NS5A genes of HCV function in HCV
replication and influence host cellular factors that are involved in HCV
pathogenesis. The current study was designed to select NS3 and NS5A antigenic
sites, amplified, cloned, and expressed in order to find out better assays for
diagnosis or drug and vaccine development. The antigenic sites within NS3 and
NS5A genes were selected and confirmed through sequencing and were cloned. The
antigenic recombinant proteins were expressed in bacterial strain E. coli
BL21ply*, and the expression was confirmed by western blotting by using
gene-specific and vector-specific antibodies.
Results: Specific antigenic regions within the NS3 and NS5A genes of the HCV 3A
genotype were amplified. PCR results showed 328 bp and 747 bp antigenic regions, 
respectively. The regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into a
bacterial expression vector. Expression analysis showed 12 kDa and 28 kDa of NS3 
and NS5A antigenic recombinant proteins, respectively. Taken together, these
studies will help to analyze the genetic variability within the local HCV
isolates as these antigenic recombinant proteins were quite important in the
screening of HCV-infected patients.
Conclusions: This study might help to enhance the progress in the treatment of
HCV infection through the modeling of HCV non-structural genes (NS3 and NS5A)
from local isolate, and it might also present the viral genes as potential
therapeutic targets.
