Stable, effective, easy-to-manufacture vaccines are critical to stopping the
COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We constructed a
vaccine candidate CoV-RBD121-NP, which is comprised of the SARS-CoV-2
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S) fused to a human IgG1
Fc domain (CoV-RBD121) and conjugated to a modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
nanoparticle. In vitro, CoV-RBD121 bound to the host virus receptor ACE2 and to
the monoclonal antibody CR3022, a neutralizing antibody that blocks S binding to 
ACE2. The CoV-RBD121-NP vaccine candidate retained key SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
epitopes, had consistent manufacturing release properties of safety, identity,
and strength, and displayed stable potency when stored for 12 months at 2-8 °C or
22-28 °C. Immunogenicity studies revealed strong antibody responses in C57BL/6
mice with non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted (7909 CpG) formulations. The
non-adjuvanted vaccine induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response and antibodies that
recognized both the S1 domain and full S protein from SARS2-CoV-2, whereas the
adjuvanted vaccine induced a Th1-biased response. Both adjuvanted and
non-adjuvanted vaccines induced virus neutralizing titers as measured by three
different assays. Collectively, these data showed the production of a stable
candidate vaccine for COVID-19 through the association of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
the TMV-like nanoparticle.
