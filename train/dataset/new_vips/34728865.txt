The current focus for many researchers has turned to the development of
therapeutics that have the potential for serving as broad-spectrum inhibitors
that can target numerous viruses, both within a particular family, as well as to 
span across multiple viral families. This will allow us to build an arsenal of
therapeutics that could be used for the next outbreak. In that regard,
nucleosides have served as the cornerstone for antiviral therapy for many
decades. As detailed herein, many nucleosides have been shown to inhibit multiple
viruses due to the conserved nature of many viral enzyme binding sites. Thus, it 
is somewhat surprising that up until very recently, many researchers focused more
on "one bug one drug," rather than trying to target multiple viruses given those 
similarities. This attitude is now changing due to the realization that we need
to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to combating emerging and
reemerging infectious diseases. A brief summary of prominent nucleoside analogues
that previously exhibited broad-spectrum activity and are now under renewed
interest, as well as new analogues, that are currently under investigation
against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses is discussed herein.
