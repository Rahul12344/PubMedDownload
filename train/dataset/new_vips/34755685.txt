With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians, public officials, and
citizens alike struggled to stay abreast of the constant and evolving stream of
information about the clinical manifestations of illness, epidemiology of the
disease, and the public health response. In this paper, we adapted (i.e., added
and modified elements) Beasley and colleagues' information chaos framework to
understand the context of citizens' experiences with information during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We will show how our adapted framework can be used to
characterize information associated challenges observed during this time and the 
possible impact of information chaos on peoples' cognition and behaviours.
Ultimately, we believe that research will benefit by adopting a more holistic
perspective using the information chaos framework than strictly studying the
independent factors in isolation.
