Furin is one of the nine-member proprotein convertase family. Furin cleaves
proteins with polybasic residues, which includes many viral glycoproteins such as
SARS-Cov-2 spike protein. The cleavage is required for the activation of the
proteins. Currently, the mechanisms that regulate Furin activity remain largely
unknown. Here we demonstrated that Furin is a novel heparin/heparan sulfate
binding protein by the use of biochemical and genetic assays. The KD is 9.78 nM
based on the biolayer interferometry assay. Moreover, we found that sulfation
degree, site-specific sulfation (N-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation), and iduronic
acid are the major structural determinants for the binding. Furthermore, we found
that heparin inhibits the enzymatic activity of Furin when pre-mixes heparin with
either Furin or Furin substrate. We also found that the Furin binds with cells of
different origin and the binding with the cells of lung origin is the strongest
one. These data could advance our understanding of the working mechanism of Furin
and will benefit the Furin based drug discovery such as inhibitors targeting the 
interaction between heparan sulfate and Furin for inhibition of viral infection.
