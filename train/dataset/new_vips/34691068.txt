The progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from a severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, may be
influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Several viruses hijack the 
host genome machinery for their own advantage and survival, and similar phenomena
might occur upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe cases of COVID-19 may be driven by 
metabolic and epigenetic driven mechanisms, including DNA methylation and
histone/chromatin alterations. These epigenetic phenomena may respond to enhanced
viral replication and mediate persistent long-term infection and clinical
phenotypes associated with severe COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Understanding
the epigenetic events involved, and their clinical significance, may provide
novel insights valuable for the therapeutic control and management of the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review highlights different epigenetic marks potentially 
associated with COVID-19 development, clinical manifestation, and progression.
