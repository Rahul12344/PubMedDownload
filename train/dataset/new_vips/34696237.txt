SARS-CoV-2 claimed numerous lives and put nations on high alert. The lack of
antiviral medications and the small number of approved vaccines, as well as the
recurrence of adverse effects, necessitates the development of novel treatment
ways to combat COVID-19. In this context, using databases such as PubMed, Google 
Scholar, and Science Direct, we gathered information about nanotechnology's
involvement in the prevention, diagnosis and virus-like particle vaccine
development. This review revealed that various nanomaterials like gold,
polymeric, graphene and poly amino ester with carboxyl group coated magnetic
nanoparticles have been explored for the fast detection of SARS-CoV-2. Personal
protective equipment fabricated with nanoparticles, such as gloves, masks,
clothes, surfactants, and Ag, TiO2 based disinfectants played an essential role
in halting COVID-19 transmission. Nanoparticles are used not only in vaccine
delivery, such as lipid nanoparticles mediated transport of mRNA-based Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines, but also in the development of vaccine as the virus-like
particles elicit an immune response. There are now 18 virus-like particle
vaccines in pre-clinical development, with one of them, developed by Novavax,
reported being in phase 3 trials. Due to the probability of upcoming COVID-19
waves, and the rise of new diseases, the future relevance of virus-like particles
is imperative. Furthermore, psychosocial variables linked to vaccine reluctance
constitute a critical problem that must be addressed immediately to avert
pandemic.
