NP105-113-B*07:02-specific CD8+ T cell responses are considered among the most
dominant in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. We found strong association of this 
response with mild disease. Analysis of NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cell clones 
and single-cell sequencing were performed concurrently, with functional avidity
and antiviral efficacy assessed using an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection system,
and were correlated with T cell receptor usage, transcriptome signature and
disease severity (acute n = 77, convalescent n = 52). We demonstrated a
beneficial association of NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cells in COVID-19 disease 
progression, linked with expansion of T cell precursors, high functional avidity 
and antiviral effector function. Broad immune memory pools were narrowed
postinfection but NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cells were maintained 6 months
after infection with preserved antiviral efficacy to the SARS-CoV-2 Victoria
strain, as well as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. Our data show that
NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cell responses associate with mild disease and high 
antiviral efficacy, pointing to inclusion for future vaccine design.
