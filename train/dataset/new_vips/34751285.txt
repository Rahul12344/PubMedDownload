An automated Cas12a-microfluidic system was constructed to distinguish the
B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 from the wild-type virus rapidly and was 
validated using 30 clinical samples, showing 100% consistency with
next-generation sequencing. It will be a potential tool for the rapid
differential diagnosis of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.
