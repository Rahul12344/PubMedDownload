SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has the characteristics of stronger infectivity, higher 
viral load, and shorter incubation period, posing new challenges to the
prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was first
discovered in India, then quickly spread in many countries and has gradually
become one of the main epidemic strains worldwide. Local epidemics caused by
SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant also occurred in several provinces in China. This
article summarizes the progress in research of etiological characteristics,
transmission characteristics or possible mechanism and epidemiological
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, and the protective effects of
vaccines and control measures against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in order to
provide references for the effective prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.

Delta变异株具有传染力强、病毒载量高、潜伏期缩短等特点，给疫情防控带来新的挑战。该变异株在印度被发现后，迅速在多个国家流行并逐渐成为全球主要流行株之一，我国多
个省份也发生了Delta变异株所致的局部聚集性疫情。本文就Delta变异株的病原学特征、传播特征及可能的机制、流行现状、疫苗对其保护效果、防控措施等方面的研究进展
进行综述，以期为科学防控Delta变异株所致疫情提供参考。.
