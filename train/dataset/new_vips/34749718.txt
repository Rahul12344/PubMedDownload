BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status (SES) groups have been disproportionately
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccination rate 
by neighborhood SES and ethnicity in Israel, a country which has achieved high
vaccination rates.
METHODS: Data on vaccinations were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health's
open COVID-19 database, for December 20, 2020 to August 31, 2021. Correlation
between vaccination rate and neighborhood SES was analyzed. Difference in
vaccination rate between the first and second vaccine dose was analyzed by
neighborhood SES and ethnicity.
FINDINGS: A clear socioeconomic gradient was demonstrated, with higher
vaccination rates in the higher SES categories (first dose: r = 0.66; second
dose: r = 0.74; third dose: r = 0.92). Vaccination uptake was lower in the lower 
SES groups and in the Arab population, with the largest difference in uptake
between Jewish and Arab localities for people younger than 60, and with the gap
widening between first and third doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Low SES groups and the Arab ethnic minority demonstrated disparities
in vaccine uptake, which were greater for the second and third, compared with the
first vaccine dose. Strategies to address vaccination inequity will need to
identify barriers, provide targeted information, and include trust-building in
disadvantaged communities.
