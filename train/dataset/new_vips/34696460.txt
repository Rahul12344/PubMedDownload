Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected almost 
200 million people worldwide and led to approximately 4 million deaths as of
August 2021. Despite successful vaccine development, treatment options are
limited. A promising strategy to specifically target viral infections is to
suppress viral replication through RNA interference (RNAi). Hence, we designed
eight small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the highly conserved
5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of SARS-CoV-2. The most promising candidate
identified in initial reporter assays, termed siCoV6, targets the leader sequence
of the virus, which is present in the genomic as well as in all subgenomic RNAs. 
In assays with infectious SARS-CoV-2, it reduced replication by two orders of
magnitude and prevented the development of a cytopathic effect. Moreover, it
retained its activity against the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant and has perfect
homology against all sequences of the delta variant that were analyzed by
bioinformatic means. Interestingly, the siRNA was even highly active in virus
replication assays with the SARS-CoV-1 family member. This work thus identified a
very potent siRNA with a broad activity against various SARS-CoV viruses that
represents a promising candidate for the development of new treatment options.
