Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an important health problem that has a
serious adverse impact on the global economy and healthcare systems. The virus is
not only involved in the respiratory system, but also causes other systemic
effects as well as several gastrointestinal and liver issues. Evidence has shown 
direct viral invasion into the gastrointestinal tissue and supporting vascular
network, causing various manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea,
gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal liver function tests. The degree of
gastrointestinal injury, especially in terms of liver involvement, is correlated 
with disease severity. There is no specific treatment for gastrointestinal
involvement, and the symptoms can be managed with supportive therapy. Moreover,
increased liver decompensation and mortality can be found in COVID-19-infected
patients with coexisting liver disease. As the virus can be identified in
gastrointestinal contents, endoscopic procedures during the pandemic should be
carefully selected and proper protection strategies should be encouraged to
prevent viral transmission.
