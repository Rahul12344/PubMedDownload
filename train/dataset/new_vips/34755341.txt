BACKGROUND: In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic forced the redesign of the
International Council of Nurses' (ICN) Global Nursing Leadership Institute (GNLI)
that heretofore had included an intensive, week-long residential experience in
Geneva, Switzerland.
AIM: This paper describes the development, implementation, challenges and
preliminary outcomes of an approach that regionalized GNLI and delivered it
online, while preserving some cross-regional connections among participants.
RESULTS: A virtual approach to a global policy leadership programme cannot
replace the richness of an intensive, concentrated residential one, but the
redesign of GNLI has given ICN, its member national nursing associations and
individual nurse leaders previously unexplored opportunities for networking and
collaboration aligned with the six WHO regions, and for cross-region networking
and discussions of global issues.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY: The SARS-CoV-2
pandemic has highlighted the need for nursing leadership in policy and practice. 
A virtual approach to leadership development can increase the reach of programmes
that seek to build nursing's capacity to advance health-promoting policies in
workplaces, organizations and nations.
