Peripheral B-lymphocyte clonality of 274 bovine leukemia virus-infected cattle
with lymphocytosis was analyzed using clonality PCR based on sequences of the
variable region of the bovine immunoglobulin H chain. None of the cattle showed
monoclonal proliferation, while 10, 31, and 233 showed minor-clonal, oligoclonal,
and polyclonal proliferation, respectively. A total of 163 cattle were analyzable
the following year, and lymphocytosis was maintained in 157, indicating
persistent lymphocytosis (PL). B-lymphocyte clonality of the 157 PL cattle was
minor-clonal in 6 (3.8%), oligoclonal in 8 (5.1%), and polyclonal in 143 (91.1%).
A higher rate of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) onset within a year was observed 
in PL cattle with minor-clonal (50.0% (3/6)) and oligoclonal (25.0% (2/8))
proliferation compared to those with polyclonal (5.6% (8/143)) proliferation.
Minor-clonal and oligoclonal proliferation in PL cattle may be a prognosis factor
for developing EBL.
