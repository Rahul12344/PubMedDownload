Germinal centers (GCs) elicit protective humoral immunity through a combination
of antibody-secreting cells and memory B cells, following pathogen invasion or
vaccination. However, the possibility of a GC response inducing protective
immunity against reinfection following severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown. We found GC activity was
consistent with seroconversion observed in recovered macaques and humans.
Rechallenge with a different clade of virus resulted in significant reduction in 
replicating virus titers in respiratory tracts in macaques with high GC activity.
However, diffuse alveolar damage and increased fibrotic tissue were observed in
lungs of reinfected macaques. Our study highlights the importance of GCs
developed during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in managing viral loads in
subsequent infections. However, their ability to alleviate lung damage remains to
be determined. These results may improve understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced
immune responses, resulting in better coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development.
