BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, understanding the virus and
necessary measures to prevent infection have evolved. While effective
preventative measures for COVID-19 have been identified, there are also
identifiable barriers to implementation.
OBJECTIVE: Explore the access to information, knowledge, and prevention methods
and barriers of COVID-19 among Somali, Karen, and Latinx immigrant community
members in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA through analysis of in-depth interviews.
METHODS: Data were collected through 32 interviews via phone, video conference on
a computer, or in-person with Somali, Karen, and Latinx adults to understand the 
experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in each group's native language. All
participants were over the age of 18, and identified as Somali, Karen, and Latinx
refugee or immigrant. Interview protocol contained 9 main questions including
probes. Data were analyzed through use of the qualitative analysis software,
Atlas.ti using phenomenology.
RESULTS: A total of 32 adults were interviewed (Somali = 12, Karen = 10, and
Latinx = 10). One-third were in person and the remainder were remote. The average
age recorded was 37 years (range 20-66 years), 43.8% males and 56.3% females.
Somali, Karen, and Latinx respondents consistently had accurate knowledge about
COVID-19 and were attentive to finding trustworthy information. Information was
available in Somali, Karen, and Latinx written language, although Karen elders
who are not literate would benefit more from video messaging. Knowledge of
preventive measures was consistent; however, barriers included access, working in
front-line positions, and living in high density housing.
CONCLUSION: Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on Somali, Karen, and Latinx
community members in Minneapolis, MN is advantageous in removing identified
barriers and disparities in health. The results of this study highlight the need 
for increased efforts to address barriers in the prevention of COVID-19, as well 
as future pandemics for immigrant and refugee populations.
