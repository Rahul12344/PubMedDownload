Worldwide, thousands of cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children
(MIS-C) have already been reported in children. Evidence regarding neonatal MIS-C
is limited. We present the first case report of a neonate presenting within 48
hours of life with predominant abdominal signs mimicking surgical abdomen.
Clinical picture comprised fever, multiorgan dysfunction (gastrointestinal,
cardiorespiratory, hepatic and dermatological), positive inflammatory markers,
high ferritin and high D-dimer levels. Cardiac enzyme N-terminal-pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide as well as D-dimer levels were elevated. Blood, urine, stool 
and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were sterile. Positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in
both the mother and the infant, along with an epidemiological evidence of
maternal contact with COVID-19, clinched the diagnosis of MIS-C. Immunomodulatory
drugs (intravenous immunoglobulin and systemic steroids) were administered and
showed good clinical response. A high index of suspicion of MIS-C in critically
ill neonates can improve outcomes.
