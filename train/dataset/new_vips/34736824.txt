INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic Radiography plays a major role in the diagnosis and
management of patients with Covid-19. This has seen an increase in the demand for
imaging services, putting pressure on the workforce. Diagnostic radiographers, as
with many other healthcare professions, have been on the frontline, dealing with 
an unprecedented situation. This research aimed to explore the experience of
diagnostic radiographers working clinically during the Covid-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Influenced by interpretative phenomenology, this study explored the
experiences of diagnostic radiographers using virtual focus group interviews as a
method of data collection.
RESULTS: Data were analysed independently by four researchers and five themes
emerged from the data. Adapting to new ways of working, feelings and emotions,
support mechanisms, self-protection and resilience, and professional recognition.
CONCLUSION: The adaptability of radiographers came across strongly in this study.
Anxieties attributed to the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE),
fear of contracting the virus and spreading it to family members were evident.
The resilience of radiographers working throughout this pandemic came across
strongly throughout this study. A significant factor for coping has been peer
support from colleagues within the workplace. The study highlighted the lack of
understanding of the role of the radiographer and how the profession is perceived
by other health care professionals.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study highlights the importance of
interprofessional working and that further work is required in the promotion of
the profession.
