BACKGROUND: This study highlights the significant association between
cyberchondria and quality of life among the Lebanese population in the time of
COVID-19. The aim was to assess the association between cyberchondria and quality
of life (QOL) of Lebanese community during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the
mediating effect of fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress and Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale in this association.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between December 2020 and
January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 449 persons participated
in this study by filling the online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling
(SEM) was performed to examine the structural relationship between cyberchondria 
severity, the mediator (anxiety, stress, depression, obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) and fear of COVID-19) and physical/mental QOL.
RESULTS: Having a university level of education and older age were significantly 
associated with higher physical QOL scores, whereas higher obsession-compulsion
disorder, higher stress and higher anxiety were significantly associated with
lower physical QOL scores. Higher anxiety was significantly associated with lower
mental QOL scores. The results of the SEM showed that stress, fear of COVID-19
and to a lesser limit OCD, mediated the association between cyberchondria
severity and physical QOL, whereas anxiety, stress and fear of COVID-19 mediated 
the association between cyberchondria severity and mental QOL.
CONCLUSION: This research reported interesting results encouraging more
exploration of cyberchondria and its association with quality of life during this
unique period of the pandemic. However, this virus has altered the lives of
individuals all across the world, and the consequences will last for a long time.
Along with all of the steps done to stop the development of COVID-19 and improve 
physical outcomes, mental health requires immediate care. More research is needed
to determine the coping techniques people are employing to deal with the
pandemic.
