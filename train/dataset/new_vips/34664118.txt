BACKGROUND: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) devices are becoming more widely
used in healthcare and have the potential to act as fomites. The objective of
this project was to study the thoroughness of cleaning of POCUS machines before
and after a quality improvement initiative. We designed a mixed-methods, pre/post
study which took place over the course of one year at a university-affiliated
health center. Cleaning rates of four ultrasound machines used by hospital
medicine and critical care medicine services were evaluated using fluorescent
marking. Interventions targeted physicians' knowledge of best practices and
improved access to cleaning supplies. Pre- and post-intervention cleaning rates
were compared using a generalized linear model. The impact of the corona virus
disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on baseline cleaning rates was also
evaluated. Physicians' attitudes and knowledge of cleaning practices were
evaluated via unpaired pre/post surveys.
RESULTS: There was significant improvement in thoroughness of cleaning following 
intervention (pre 0.62, SE 0.05; post 0.89, SE 0.07), p < 0.0001). There was no
difference in baseline cleaning rates before (0.63, SE 0.09) and after (0.61, SE 
0.1) the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.78). Post-intervention surveying
found improved understanding of guideline-based cleaning practice, better
performance on knowledge-based questions, and fewer reported barriers to machine 
cleaning.
CONCLUSION: Thoroughness of cleaning of POCUS machines can be improved with
practical interventions that target knowledge and access to cleaning supplies.
