Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019. Despite the recent introduction of vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2, more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs must be developed. Here, 
we isolated five SARS-CoV-2 strains from four patients with coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) and an asymptomatic individual using pharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal 
swabs, and sputum samples. Cytopathic effects in inoculated Vero cells were
observed between days 3 and 7. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by quantitative
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and next-generation
sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses of the whole genome sequences showed that the
virus isolates from the clinical samples were belonged to the Wuhan and European 
lineages. These findings and isolated viruses may contribute to the development
of diagnostic tools, vaccines, and antiviral drugs for COVID-19.
