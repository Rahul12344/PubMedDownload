Many positive-sense RNA viruses transcribe subgenomic (sg) mRNAs during
infections that template the translation of a subset of viral proteins. Red
clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) expresses its capsid protein through the
transcription of a sg mRNA from RNA1 genome segment. This transcription event is 
activated by an RNA structure formed by base pairing between a trans-activator
(TA) in RNA2 and a trans-activator binding site (TABS) in RNA1. In this study,
the impact of the structural context of the TABS in RNA1 on the TA-TABS
interaction and sg mRNA transcription was investigated using in vitro and in vivo
approaches. The results (i) generated RNA secondary structure models for the TA
and TABS, (ii) revealed that the TABS is partially base paired with proximal
upstream sequences, which limits TA access, (iii) demonstrated that the
aforementioned intra-RNA1 base pairing involving the TABS modulates the TA-TABS
interaction in vitro and sg mRNA levels during infections, and (iv) revealed that
the TABS in RNA1 can be modified to mediate sg mRNA transcription in a
TA-independent manner. These findings advance our understanding of
transcriptional regulation in RCNMV and provide novel insights into the origin of
the TA-TABS interaction.
