While the liver, specifically hepatocytes, are widely accepted as the main source
of hepatitis C virus (HCV) production, the role of the liver/hepatocytes in
clearance of circulating HCV remains unknown. Frequent HCV kinetic data were
recorded and mathematically modeled from five liver transplant patients
throughout the anhepatic (absence of liver) phase and for 4 hr post-reperfusion. 
During the anhepatic phase, HCV remained at pre-anhepatic levels (n = 3) or
declined (n = 2) with t1/2~1 hr. Immediately post-reperfusion, virus declined in 
a biphasic manner in four patients consisting of a rapid decline (t1/2 = 5 min)
followed by a slower decline (t1/2 = 67 min). Consistent with the majority of
patients in the anhepatic phase, when we monitored HCV clearance at 37°C from
culture medium in the absence/presence of chronically infected hepatoma cells
that were inhibited from secreting HCV, the HCV t1/2 in cell culture was longer
in the absence of chronically HCV-infected cells. The results suggest that the
liver plays a major role in the clearance of circulating HCV and that hepatocytes
may be involved.
