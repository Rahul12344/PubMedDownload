BACKGROUND: To reduce the coronavirus disease burden in England, along with many 
other countries, the government implemented a package of non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) that have also impacted other transmissible infectious
diseases such as norovirus. It is unclear what future norovirus disease incidence
is likely to look like upon lifting these restrictions.
METHODS: Here we use a mathematical model of norovirus fitted to community
incidence data in England to project forward expected incidence based on contact 
surveys that have been collected throughout 2020-2021.
RESULTS: We report that susceptibility to norovirus infection has likely
increased between March 2020 and mid-2021. Depending upon assumptions of future
contact patterns incidence of norovirus that is similar to pre-pandemic levels or
an increase beyond what has been previously reported is likely to occur once
restrictions are lifted. Should adult contact patterns return to 80% of
pre-pandemic levels, the incidence of norovirus will be similar to previous
years. If contact patterns return to pre-pandemic levels, there is a potential
for the expected annual incidence to be up to 2-fold larger than in a typical
year. The age-specific incidence is similar across all ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued national surveillance for endemic diseases such as
norovirus will be essential after NPIs are lifted to allow healthcare services to
adequately prepare for a potential increase in cases and hospital pressures
beyond what is typically experienced.
