Viral-deletion mutants that conditionally replicate and inhibit the wild-type
virus (i.e., defective interfering particles, DIPs) have long been proposed as
single-administration interventions with high genetic barriers to resistance.
However, theories predict that robust, therapeutic DIPs (i.e., therapeutic
interfering particles, TIPs) must conditionally spread between cells with R0 >1. 
Here, we report engineering of TIPs that conditionally replicate with SARS-CoV-2,
exhibit R0 >1, and inhibit viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Inhibition occurs
via competition for viral replication machinery, and a single administration of
TIP RNA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 sustainably in continuous cultures. Strikingly, TIPs 
maintain efficacy against neutralization-resistant variants (e.g., B.1.351). In
hamsters, both prophylactic and therapeutic intranasal administration of
lipid-nanoparticle TIPs durably suppressed SARS-CoV-2 by 100-fold in the lungs,
reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and prevented severe pulmonary
edema. These data provide proof of concept for a class of single-administration
antivirals that may circumvent current requirements to continually update medical
countermeasures against new variants.
