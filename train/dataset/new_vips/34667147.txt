In the absence of virus-targeting small-molecule drugs approved for the treatment
and prevention of COVID-19, broadening the repertoire of potent
SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies represents an important area of research in
response to the ongoing pandemic. Systematic analysis of such antibodies and
their combinations can be particularly instrumental for identification of
candidates that may prove resistant to the emerging viral escape variants. Here, 
we isolated a panel of 23 RBD-specific human monoclonal antibodies from the B
cells of convalescent patients. A surprisingly large proportion of such
antibodies displayed potent virus-neutralizing activity both in vitro and in
vivo. Four of the isolated nAbs can be categorized as ultrapotent with an
apparent IC100 below 16 ng/mL. We show that individual nAbs as well as dual
combinations thereof retain activity against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2
variants of concern (such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617, and C.37), as well as
against other viral variants. When used as a prophylactics or therapeutics, these
nAbs could potently suppress viral replication and prevent lung pathology in
SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Our data contribute to the rational development of 
oligoclonal therapeutic nAb cocktails mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 escape.
