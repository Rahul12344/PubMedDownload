The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide,
therefore there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify
infected cases. Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2
detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory 
and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several 
groups have recently reported the development of loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2
detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays
that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and
Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false
positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using
colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that
all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min, with robust accuracy at
detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply
by color changes. Incorporation of RT-LAMP with fluorescent detection further
increases the detection sensitivity to as little as 100 RNA copies. We also note 
the shortcomings of some LAMP-based assays, including variable results with
shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in 
some experimental conditions and clinical saliva samples. Overall for RT-LAMP
detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have faster kinetics for
detection but varying degrees of false positives detection, whereas the Gene N
assay exhibits no false positives in 30 min reaction time, which highlights the
importance of optimal primer design to minimise false-positives in RT-LAMP. This 
study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays as a rapid,
highly sensitive detection method for SARS-CoV-2, which have important
implications in development of point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.
