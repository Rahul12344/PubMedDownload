Efficient COVID-19 vaccines are widely acknowledged as the best way to end the
global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) plays fundamental roles
related to cell infection. Antibodies could be developed to target RBD and
represent a potential approach for the neutralization of the virus. Epitopes used
to produce antibodies are generally linear peptides and thus possess multiple
confirmations that do not reflect the actual topology of the targeted part in the
native protein. On the other hand, macrocyclic epitopes could constitute closer
mimics of the native protein topology and, as such, could generate superior
antibodies. In this study, we demonstrated the vital effect of the size and the
three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the activity of the developed antibodies
against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater 
stability of the cyclic epitopes compared with the linear counterparts, which was
reflected in the affinity of the produced antibodies. The antibodies developed
using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD
compared to antibodies formed from linear peptides. This study constitutes a
roadmap for developing superior antibodies that could be used to inhibit the
activity of SARS-CoV-2.
