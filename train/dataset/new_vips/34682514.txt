BACKGROUND: Hospital staffing shortages are again (mid-year 2021) becoming a
significant problem as the number of positive COVID-19 cases continues to
increase worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs of sending HCW into quarantine (Scenario 1) from
the hospital's and the taxpayer's perspective versus the costs arising from
implementing point-of-care COVID-19 antigen testing (POCT) for those staff
members who, despite learning that they have been exposed to hospital patients
later found to be infected with COVID-19, continue to report to work (Scenario
2).
METHODS: A mathematical model was built to calculate the costs of a
sample-and-stay strategy for exposed healthcare workers (HCW) in Germany by
utilizing a high-quality antigen fluorescent immunoassay (FIA), compared to the
costs of quarantine. Direct costs and wage costs were evaluated from the hospital
as well as from the taxpayer perspective assuming a SARS-CoV-2 infection
prevalence of 10%.
RESULTS: Serial POCT testing of exposed HCW in Germany (Scenario 2) who do not go
into quarantine but continue to work during a post-exposure period of 14 days at 
their working place raises costs of EUR 289 (±20%: EUR 231 to EUR 346, rounded)
per HCW at the expense of the employing hospital while the extra-costs to the
taxpayer per exposed HCW are limited to EUR 16 (±20%: EUR 13 to EUR 19). In
contrast, sending HCW into quarantine (Scenario 1) would result in costs of EUR
111 (±20%: EUR 89 to EUR 133) per exposed HCW for the hospital but EUR 2235
(±20%: EUR 1744 to EUR 2727) per HCW at the expense of the taxpayer.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring exposed HCW who continued working by sequential POCT may 
considerably reduce costs from the perspective of the taxpayer and help mitigate 
personnel shortages in hospitals during pandemic COVID-19 waves.
