Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are living longer due to advancements in
treatment. We present a patient with CF in whom diagnoses of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and severe pneumocystis pneumonia were delayed due
to anchor bias. Our case highlights the importance of routine age-appropriate
health screenings in patients with CF. In addition, we discuss the number of
management challenges that may arise in patients with a dual diagnosis of CF and 
HIV.
