The media has prominently featured the totemic reproductive number R in its
COVID-19 coverage despite being an imperfect measure of the degree of infectivity
of the virus. As such, it conveys information to the public regarding the state
of the pandemic that affects market sentiment. We analyze how news about R
affects the volatility in stock markets worldwide and find that when R is greater
than one, which means the spread of the disease should soar, it has a positive
and significant effect on volatility. Our results hold after controlling for
government interventions and several robustness checks.
