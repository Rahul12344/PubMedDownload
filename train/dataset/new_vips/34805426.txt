Background: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasingly recognized as 
a complication of severe influenza and coronavirus disease 2019. The extent to
which other respiratory viral infections (RVIs) predispose to IPA is unclear.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of IPA occurring within 90 days of
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, or adenovirus infections
(noninfluenza respiratory viral infections [NI-RVIs]) in patients who underwent
solid organ transplant between 1/15/2011 and 12/19/2017.
Results: At a median post-transplant follow-up of 43.4 months, 221 of 2986
patients (7.4%) developed 255 RSV, parainfluenza, or adenovirus infections. IPA
complicating these NI-RVIs was exclusively observed in lung and small bowel
transplant recipients, in whom incidence was 5% and 33%, respectively. Cumulative
prednisone doses >140mg within 7 days and pneumonia at the time of NI-RVI were
independent risk factors for IPA (odds ratio [OR], 22.6; 95% CI, 4.5-112; and OR,
7.2; 95% CI, 1.6-31.7; respectively). Mortality at 180 days following NI-RVI was 
27% and 7% among patients with and without IPA, respectively (P = .04).
Conclusions: In conclusion, IPA can complicate RSV, parainfluenza, and adenovirus
infection in lung and small bowel transplant recipients. Future research is
needed on the epidemiology of IPA complicating various RVIs. In the interim,
physicians should be aware of this complication.
