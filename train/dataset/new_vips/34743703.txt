BACKGROUND: Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T
cells combined with checkpoint inhibition may prevent T cell exhaustion and
improve clinical outcomes. However, the approach is limited by cumulative costs
and toxicities.
METHODS: To overcome this drawback, we created a CAR-T (RB-340-1) that unites in 
one product the two modalities: a CRISPR interference-(CRISPRi) circuit prevents 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression upon antigen-encounter.
RB-340-1 is engineered to express an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 (HER2) CAR single chain variable fragment (scFv), with CD28 and CD3ζ
co-stimulatory domains linked to the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and a
single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the PD-1 transcription start site (TSS). A
second constructs includes linker for activation of T cells (LAT) fused to
nuclease-deactivated spCas9 (dCas9)-Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) via a
TEV-cleavable sequence (TCS). Upon antigen encounter, the LAT-dCas9-KRAB (LdCK)
complex is cleaved by TEV allowing targeting of dCas9-KRAB to the PD-1 gene TSS.
RESULTS: Here, we show that RB-340-1 consistently demonstrated higher production 
of homeostatic cytokines, enhanced expansion of CAR-T cells in vitro, prolonged
in vivo persistence and more efficient suppression of HER2+ FaDu oropharyngeal
cancer growth compared to the respective conventional CAR-T cell product.
CONCLUSIONS: As the first application of CRISPRi toward a clinically relevant
product, RB-340-1 with the conditional, non-gene editing and reversible
suppression promotes CAR-T cells resilience to checkpoint inhibition, and their
persistence and effectiveness against HER2-expressing cancer xenografts.
