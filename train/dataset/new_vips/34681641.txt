G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures involved in the
regulation of key cellular processes, such as transcription and replication.
Since their discovery, G4s have been mainly investigated for their role in cancer
and as targets in anticancer therapy. More recently, exploration of the presence 
and role of G4s in viral genomes has led to the discovery of G4-regulated key
viral pathways. In this context, employment of selective G4 ligands has helped to
understand the complexity of G4-mediated mechanisms in the viral life cycle, and 
highlighted the possibility to target viral G4s as an emerging antiviral
approach. Research in this field is growing at a fast pace, providing increasing 
evidence of the antiviral activity of old and new G4 ligands. This review aims to
provide a punctual update on the literature on G4 ligands exploited in virology. 
Different classes of G4 binders are described, with emphasis on possible
antiviral applications in emerging diseases, such as the current COVID-19
pandemic. Strengths and weaknesses of G4 targeting in viruses are discussed.
