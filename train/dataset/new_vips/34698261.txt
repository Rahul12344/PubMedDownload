The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) has 
devastated global healthcare and economies. Despite the stabilization of
infectivity rates in some developed nations, several countries are still under
the grip of the pathogenic viral mutants that are causing a significant increase 
in infections and hospitalization. Given this urgency, targeting of key host
factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is postulated as a novel strategy to
counter the virus and its associated pathological outcomes. In this regard, Poly 
(ADP)-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is being increasingly recognized as a possible
target. PARP-1 is well studied in human diseases such as cancer, central nervous 
system (CNS) disorders and pathology of RNA viruses. Emerging evidence indicates 
that regulation of PARP-1 by non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs is integral to
cell survival, redox balance, DNA damage response, energy homeostasis, and
several other cellular processes. In this short perspective, we summarize the
recent findings on the microRNA/PARP-1 axis and its therapeutic potential for
COVID-19 pathologies.
