Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a sensitive and important marker of liver
injury, which is closely related to the disease progression. It is the key rather
than the only parameter to initiate treatment decisions for patients with chronic
hepatitis B virus infection. The normal reference range of ALT is derived from
epidemiological investigation of healthy population, which varies among different
countries, regions or laboratories. Hepatologists should conduct a large number
of cohort clinical studies based on the natural history and the prognosis of the 
disease, and adjust the cut-off value of ALT levels to make clinical decisions in
order to determine the degree of liver injury, the treatment initiation and
response.

血清丙氨酸转氨酶（ALT）是反映肝脏损伤的敏感且重要的指标。在慢性乙型肝炎病毒感染者中，血清ALT水平与肝脏疾病进展密切相关，是启动乙型肝炎抗病毒治疗的关键指标之
一，但并不是唯一指标。ALT的正常参考范围源于健康人群的流行病学调查，在不同国家及地区或不同实验室间有所差别；而ALT的临床决策阈值则需要肝脏病专家结合疾病自然史
