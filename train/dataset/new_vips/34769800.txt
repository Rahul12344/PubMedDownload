The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the change in sedentary time during
the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on health outcomes in the general
population. One thousand six hundred and one articles published after 2019 were
retrieved from five databases, of which 64 and 40 were included in the systematic
review and meta-analysis, respectively. Studies were grouped according to
population: children (<18 years), adults (18-64 years) and older adults (>65
years). Average sedentary time was calculated, with sub-analyses performed by
country, behaviour type and health outcomes. Children were most affected,
increasing their sedentary time by 159.5 ± 142.6 min day-1, followed by adults
(+126.9 ± 42.2 min day-1) and older adults (+46.9 ± 22.0 min day-1). There were
no sex differences in any age group. Screen time was the only consistently
measured behaviour and accounted for 46.8% and 57.2% of total sedentary time in
children and adults, respectively. Increases in sedentary time were negatively
correlated with global mental health, depression, anxiety and quality of life,
irrespective of age. Whilst lockdown negatively affected all age groups, children
were more negatively affected than adults or older adults, highlighting this
population as a key intervention target. As lockdowns ease worldwide, strategies 
should be employed to reduce time spent sedentary. Trial registration: PROSPERO
(CRD42020208909).
