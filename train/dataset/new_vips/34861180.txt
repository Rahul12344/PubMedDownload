BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to inform policy deliberations about whether 
children with asthma should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and, if so, which
subset of children with asthma should be prioritised. We were asked by the UK's
Joint Commission on Vaccination and Immunisation to undertake an urgent analysis 
to identify which children with asthma were at increased risk of serious COVID-19
outcomes.
METHODS: This national incident cohort study was done in all children in Scotland
aged 5-17 years who were included in the linked dataset of Early Pandemic
Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II). We used data from
EAVE II to investigate the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among children with
markers of uncontrolled asthma defined by either previous asthma hospital
admission or oral corticosteroid prescription in the previous 2 years. A Cox
proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for 
the association between asthma and COVID-19 hospital admission, stratified by
markers of asthma control (previous asthma hospital admission and number of
previous prescriptions for oral corticosteroids within 2 years of the study start
date). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidity,
and previous hospital admission.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2020, and July 27, 2021, 752 867 children were
included in the EAVE II dataset, 63 463 (8·4%) of whom had
clinician-diagnosed-and-recorded asthma. Of these, 4339 (6·8%) had RT-PCR
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In those with confirmed infection, 67 (1·5%) were
admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Among the 689 404 children without asthma,
40 231 (5·8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of whom 382 (0·9%) were
admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was
higher in children with poorly controlled asthma than in those with well
controlled asthma or without asthma. When using previous hospital admission for
asthma as the marker of uncontrolled asthma, the adjusted HR was 6·40 (95% CI
3·27-12·53) for those with poorly controlled asthma and 1·36 (1·02-1·80) for
those with well controlled asthma, compared with those with no asthma. When using
oral corticosteroid prescriptions as the marker of uncontrolled asthma, the
adjusted HR was 3·38 (1·84-6·21) for those with three or more prescribed courses 
of corticosteroids, 3·53 (1·87-6·67) for those with two prescribed courses of
corticosteroids, 1·52 (0·90-2·57) for those with one prescribed course of
corticosteroids, and 1·34 (0·98-1·82) for those with no prescribed course,
compared with those with no asthma.
INTERPRETATION: School-aged children with asthma with previous recent hospital
admission or two or more courses of oral corticosteroids are at markedly
increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission and should be considered a priority
for vaccinations. This would translate into 9124 children across Scotland and an 
estimated 109 448 children across the UK.
