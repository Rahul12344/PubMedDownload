BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are at increased risk
for thromboembolic events. It is unclear whether the risk for gastrointestinal
(GI) bleeding is also increased.
METHODS: We considered 4128 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Lean European Open 
Survey on SARS-CoV-2 (LEOSS) registry. The association between occurrence of GI
bleeding and comorbidities as well as medication were examined. In addition, 1216
patients from COKA registry were analyzed focusing on endoscopy diagnostic
findings.
RESULTS: A cumulative number of 97 patients (1.8%) with GI bleeding were
identified in the LEOSS registry and COKA registry. Of 4128 patients from the
LEOSS registry, 66 patients (1.6%) had a GI bleeding. The rate of GI bleeding in 
patients with intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 4.5%. The use of
therapeutic dose of anticoagulants showed a significant association with the
increased incidence of bleeding in the critical phase of disease. The Charlson
comorbidity index and the COVID-19 severity index were significantly higher in
the group of patients with GI bleeding than in the group of patients without GI
bleeding (5.83 (SD = 2.93) vs. 3.66 (SD = 3.06), p < 0.01 and 3.26 (SD = 1.69)
vs. 2.33 (SD = 1.53), p < 0.01, respectively). In the COKA registry 31 patients
(2.5%) developed a GI bleeding. Of these, the source of bleeding was identified
in upper GI tract in 21 patients (67.7%) with ulcer as the most frequent bleeding
source (25.8%, n = 8) followed by gastroesophageal reflux (16.1%, n = 5). In
three patients (9.7%) GI bleeding source was located in lower GI tract caused
mainly by diverticular bleeding (6.5%, n = 2). In seven patients (22.6%) the
bleeding localization remained unknown.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous research, comorbidities and disease severity
correlate with the incidence of GI bleeding. Also, therapeutic anticoagulation
seems to be associated with a higher risk of GI bleeding. Overall, the risk of GI
bleeding seems not to be increased in COVID-19 patients.
