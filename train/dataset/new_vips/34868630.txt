Background: To date, there are no data available on the safety of COVID-19
vaccines in Latin American patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
Objective: Characterize safety of COVID-19 vaccines in Latin American (LATAM)
patients with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS).
Methods: A cross-sectional study between February 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021.
Individuals with MS from LATAM countries were invited to participate in a
self-administered web-based survey, through MS patient organizations from the
region.
Results: 393 vaccinated pwMS from 10 different Latin American countries were
included. The vaccines administered were: inactivated virus vaccines (IVV) in
38.2% of patients, adenovirus vector vaccines (AdV) in 48.8% and mRNA vaccines
13%. All patients received at least one dose of any of the COVID-19 vaccines and 
123 (31.3%) declared receiving a second dose. Mean (SD) age 41.5 (11.8) years,
82.4% female, MS disease duration: 8.4 (8.2) years. No serious adverse events
were reported with any of the COVID-19 vaccines after either the first or second 
dose. A lower frequency of adverse events was found with IVV (22%) in comparison 
with AdV (46.4%) and mRNA (35.3%) (p < 0.01). Five participants reported having
an MS relapse after IVV first dose.
Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccines applied in LATAM proved safe for MS patients.
