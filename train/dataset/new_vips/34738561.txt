BACKGROUND: Italy and especially Lombardy region was the first European Country
hit by the covid 19 pandemic, without a proper preparedness plan. Italy's
health-care service is a regionally based National Health Service (NHS) that
provides universal coverage, largely free of charge at the point of service. Aim 
of this paper is to analyse the national and especially the regional strategies
put in place to face the pandemic, focusing on the impact of the overlap of the
political and health competences among national and regional authority.
METHODS: Italian hygiene and preventive medicine society (SITI) realized a
questionnaire submitted to National Institute for Health and regional stakeholder
to investigate the response to the epidemic analysing the strategies and actions 
put in place both by the national and regional governments and the regional
health authorities.
RESULTS: The national survey highlighted several critical points in the
management of the covid 19 pandemic in the different regional contexts such as
lack of personnel in preventive departments and preparadness.
CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learnt during the pandemic should shape the future of the
Italian health service. (www.actabiomedica.it).
