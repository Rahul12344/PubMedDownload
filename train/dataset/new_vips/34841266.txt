The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been severely detrimental to most firms. 
Preliminary estimates from Italy, which experienced the worst devastation from
the virus during the early days of the pandemic, predicted that the country could
lose at least $8.3 bn in the service and manufacturing sectors due to the
coronavirus pandemic. Although there has been a series of ongoing government
policies to mitigate the economic effect of the pandemic, we do not know to what 
extent these policies have been effective. Using two-period panel data (before
and during the pandemic) on 419 Italian firms, this study examines the impact of 
government policies on firms using first difference estimation. The results show 
that firms that received a government grant in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic 
saw on average an 11% increase in sales revenue by the end of June 2020 compared 
to those yet to receive grants. A sectoral decomposition of the analysis
indicates government policy to be effective in the services sector if performance
is measured by sales revenue.Supplementary Information: The online version
