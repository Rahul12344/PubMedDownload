Purpose: Low adherence to medication is an important reason why pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) is not effective at reducing the rate of new human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among men who have sex with men (MSM).
The intelligent reminder system (IRS) has been designed to improve user
compliance, but the intention of MSM to use the IRS remains unclear. This study
establishes a theoretical model to analyze the factors influencing their
intention to use the IRS.
Patients and Methods: Non-probability sampling was used to recruit MSM volunteers
in Chongqing and Sichuan, China, and the data were collected from MSM who had
used the IRS. A model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of
technology (UTAUT) was established for the data through a structural equation
model, and the perceived privacy risk was considered to explore the subjects'
behavior intention.
Results: A total of 111 volunteers who had used the IRS filled out a
questionnaire. Social influence had the greatest impact on behavior intention (β 
= 0.360, P < 0.001), followed by performance expectancy (β = 0.331, P < 0.001),
and perceived privacy risk had a negative impact on behavior intention (β =
-0.151, P = 0.040). In addition, social influence had an indirect effect on
behavior intention (β = 0.182, P = 0.003) and performance expectancy played a
mediating role in this indirect effect.
Conclusion: Developments in the IRS are required to improve its usefulness and
adequately explain its role when recommending it to MSM. It is also important to 
improve the system's ability to protect user privacy. Clinical evidence for the
effectiveness of the IRS is conducive to its widespread use.
