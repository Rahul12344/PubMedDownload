Acute oesophageal necrosis, black oesophagus (BE) or Gurvits syndrome (GS) is a
rare form of severe oesophagitis appearing as a striking circumferential
discolouration of distal mucosa with various proximal extensions abruptly
terminating at the gastro-oesophageal junction. It is most commonly associated
with acute exacerbations of medical comorbidities, while associations with
altered gut anatomy are rare. We present a unique constellation of BE, Cameron
ulcers (CU), and gastric volvulus from a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia. Our 
patient recently recovered from COVID-19 and was malnourished and frail, while
the expanding paraesophageal hiatal hernia turned into an acute organoaxial
gastric volvulus with accompanying outlet obstruction. In low-flow post-COVID
coagulopathic states, compensatory mechanisms may lack against gastric stunning
and sudden massive reflux on the oesophagus. We additionally performed a
systematic review and discovered additional cases with coexistent volvulus and
paraesophageal hernia, although there are no previous reports of BE with CU,
which makes this study the first.
