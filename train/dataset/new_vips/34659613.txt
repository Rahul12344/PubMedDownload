Ebola virus disease is a serious, often fatal disease whose case-fatality rate
can be 90%. Our short-term goal is to create awareness on Ebola virus signs and
to encourage early diagnosis in our milieu. We observed Ebola virus disease cases
in our community. It is not always possible to quickly identify patients with
Ebola virus disease. For this reason, it is essential that healthcare providers
use standard precautions for all patient care, regardless of diagnosis, in any
professional practice and at all times. The government of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo supported by several other organizations should implement mass
awareness and vaccine programs against Ebola virus.
