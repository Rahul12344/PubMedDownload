BACKGROUND: Primary care is crucial to the health of individuals and communities,
but it faces numerous structural and systemic challenges. Our study assessed the 
state of primary care in Virginia to prepare for Medicaid expansion. It also
provides insight into the frontline of health care prior to an unprecedented
global COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We surveyed 1622 primary care practices to understand organizational
characteristics, scope of care, capacity, and organizational stress.
RESULTS: Practices (484) varied in type, ownership, location, and care for
medically underserved and diverse patient populations. Most practices accepted
uninsured and Medicaid patients. Practices reported a broad scope of care,
including offering behavioral health and medication-assisted therapy for opioid
addiction. Over half addressed social needs like transportation and unstable
housing. One in three practices experienced a significant stress in 2019,
prepandemic, and only 18.8% of practices anticipated a stress in 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care serves as the foundation of our health care system and 
is an essential service, but it is severely stressed, under-resourced, and
overburdened in the best of times. Primary care needs strategic workforce
planning, adequate access to resources, and financial investment to sustain its
value and innovation.
