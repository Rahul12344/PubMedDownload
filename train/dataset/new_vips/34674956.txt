BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) represent a major cause of
clinical visits worldwide. Viral epidemiology of RTIs in adults has been less
studied compared to children. FilmArray respiratory panel (FA-RP), a multiplex,
real time polymerase chain reaction method can simultaneously detect the nucleic 
acids of multiple pathogens. The purpose of this study is to analyze the
epidemiology and clinical presentations of an RTI cohort.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at China Medical
University Hospital (CMUH) and China Medical University Children's Hospital
(CMUCH), from January 2020 to June 2020. The FA-RP results were collected and
analyzed according to upper versus lower RTIs.
RESULTS: Among 253 respiratory samples tested, 135 (53.4%) were from adults and
118 (46.6%) from children. A total positive rate of 33.9% (86/253) was found,
with 21.48% (29/135) in adults and 48.31% (57/118) in children. Human
rhinovirus/Enterovirus (HRV/EV) was detected in most of the age groups and was
more common in URIs. HRV/EV was found as a frequent co-detection virus. Among
children, HRV/EV was the most detected pathogen of URIs, while the most
predominant pathogen in LRIs was Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
CONCLUSIONS: FA-RP has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory
pathogens. The positive rate of FA-RP was higher in children compared to adults, 
which likely corresponds to the higher incidence of viral RTIs in children.
Different pathogens may lead to different types of respiratory infections.
