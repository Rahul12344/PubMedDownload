The aim of the investigation was to study the clinical course of COVID-19 in the 
presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and elucidate possible mechanisms of their
mutual aggravation.Materials and Methods: The study included 64 patients with
COVID-19; of them, 32 were with DM (main group) and 32 were DM-free (control
group). The groups were formed according to the "case-control" principle. During 
hospitalization, the dynamics of clinical, glycemic, and coagulation parameters, 
markers of systemic inflammation, as well as kidney and liver functions were
monitored and compared.
Results: Among patients with DM, the course of viral pneumonia was more severe,
as evidenced by a 2.2-fold higher number of people with extensive (>50%) lung
damage (p=0.05), an increased risk of death according to the CURB-65 algorithm
(1.3-fold, p=0.043), and a longer duration of insufficient blood oxygen
saturation (p=0.0004). With the combination of COVID-19 and DM, hyperglycemia is 
persistent, without pronounced variability (MAGE - 1.5Â±0.6 mmol/L), the levels of
C-reactive protein (p=0.028), creatinine (p=0.035), and fibrinogen (p=0.013) are 
higher, manifestations of hypercoagulability persist longer, including slower
normalization of antithrombin III (p=0.012), fibrinogen (p=0.037), and D-dimer
(p=0.035).
Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 in patients with DM is associated with a high 
severity and extension of pneumonia, persistent decrease in oxygen supply, high
hyperglycemia, accelerated renal dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and
hypercoagulability.
