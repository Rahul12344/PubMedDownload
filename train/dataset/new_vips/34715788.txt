BACKGROUND: With the high prevalence of COVID-19 infections worldwide, the
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) is becoming an increasingly
recognized entity. This syndrome presents in patients several weeks after
infection with COVID-19 and is associated with thrombosis, elevated inflammatory 
markers, hemodynamic compromise and cardiac dysfunction. Treatment is often with 
steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). The pathologic basis of
myocardial injury in MIS-A, however, is not well characterized. In our case
report, we obtained endomyocardial biopsy that revealed a pattern of myocardial
injury similar to that found in COVID-19 cardiac specimens.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male presented with fevers, chills, headache,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 5 weeks after his COVID-19 infection. His
SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative and IgG was positive, consistent with prior
infection. He was found to be in cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure,
requiring inotropes and diuretics. Given concern for acute fulminant myocarditis,
an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was performed, showing an inflammatory infiltrate 
consisting predominantly of interstitial macrophages with scant T lymphocytes.
The histologic pattern was similar to that of cardiac specimens from COVID-19
patients, helping rule out myocarditis as the prevailing diagnosis. His case was 
complicated by persistent hypoxemia, and a computed tomography scan revealed
pulmonary emboli. He received IVIg, steroids, and anticoagulation with rapid
recovery of biventricular function.
CONCLUSIONS: MIS-A should be considered as the diagnosis in patients presenting
several weeks after COVID-19 infection with severe inflammation and multi-organ
involvement. In our case, EMB facilitated identification of MIS-A and guided
therapy. The patient's biventricular function recovered with IVIg and steroids.
