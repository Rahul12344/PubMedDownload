The chest X-ray is considered a significant clinical utility for basic
examination and diagnosis. The human lung area can be affected by various
infections, such as bacteria and viruses, leading to pneumonia. Efficient and
reliable classification method facilities the diagnosis of such infections. Deep 
transfer learning has been introduced for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays
in different models. However, there is still a need for further improvements in
the feature extraction and advanced classification stages. This paper proposes a 
classification method with two stages to classify different cases from the chest 
X-ray images based on a proposed Advanced Squirrel Search Optimization Algorithm 
(ASSOA). The first stage is the feature learning and extraction processes based
on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named ResNet-50 with image
augmentation and dropout processes. The ASSOA algorithm is then applied to the
extracted features for the feature selection process. Finally, the Multi-layer
Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network's connection weights are optimized by the
proposed ASSOA algorithm (using the selected features) to classify input cases. A
Kaggle chest X-ray images (Pneumonia) dataset consists of 5,863 X-rays is
employed in the experiments. The proposed ASSOA algorithm is compared with the
basic Squirrel Search (SS) optimization algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection to validate its efficiency. The
proposed (ASSOA + MLP) is also compared with other classifiers, based on (SS +
MLP), (GWO + MLP), and (GA + MLP), in performance metrics. The proposed (ASSOA + 
MLP) algorithm achieved a classification mean accuracy of (99.26%). The ASSOA +
MLP algorithm also achieved a classification mean accuracy of (99.7%) for a chest
X-ray COVID-19 dataset tested from GitHub. The results and statistical tests
demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed method in determining the
infected cases.
