Host immune response and virulence factors are key to disease susceptibility.
However, there are no known association studies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
class I and II alleles with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in the Latin
American population. Here, we aimed to identify HLA alleles present in patients
with CHIKV infection versus healthy controls as well as the allelic association
with the clinical spectrum of the disease. We conducted a cross-sectional
analysis of a community cohort and included patients aged 18 years and older with
serologically confirmed CHIKV infection. HLA typing of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1
alleles was performed. Two-by-two tables were used to establish associations
between allele presence and clinical characteristics. Data from 65 patients with 
confirmed CHIKV infection were analyzed for HLA typing. CHIKV infection was
significantly associated with the presence of HLA-A*68 [p = .005; odds ratio
(OR): 8.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.88-42.13], HLA-B*35 (p = .03; OR:
2.01; 95% CI: 1.06-3.86), HLA-DRB*01 (p <.001; OR: 5.70; 95% CI: 1.95-16.59),
HLA-DRB1*04 (p <.001; OR: 7.37; 95% CI: 3.33-16.30), and HLA-DRB1*13 (p = .004;
OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.50-9.39) alleles in patients versus healthy subjects. A
statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of a rash
on the face or abdomen and the presence of HLA-DRB1*04 (p = .028; OR: 3.2; 95%
CI: 1.11-9.15 and p = .007; OR: 4.33; 95% CI: 1.45-12.88, respectively). Our
study demonstrated that, in our cohort, HLA type I and type II alleles are
associated with CHIKV infection, and an HLA type II allele is associated with
dermatological symptoms. Further research is needed to establish a path for
future investigation of genes outside the HLA system to improve knowledge of the 
pathophysiology of CHIKV infection and its host-pathogen interaction.
