PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Behavioral therapies are proven treatments for many neurologic
conditions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for
conducting behavioral research. This article aims to (1) highlight the challenges
of running behavioral clinical trials during the pandemic, (2) suggest approaches
to maximize generalizability of pandemic-era studies, and (3) offer strategies
for successful behavioral trials beyond the pandemic.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thousands of clinical trials have been impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic, from undergoing protocol revisions to suspension altogether.
Furthermore, for ongoing trials, recruitment of diverse populations has suffered,
thereby exacerbating existing inequities in clinical research. Patient adherence 
and retention have been affected by a myriad of pandemic-era restraints, and
medical, psychiatric, and other complications from the pandemic have the
potential to have long-term effects on pandemic-era study results. In the
development of post-pandemic study protocols, attention should be given to
designing studies that incorporate successful aspects of pre-pandemic and
pandemic-era strategies to (1) broaden recruitment using new techniques, (2)
improve access for diverse populations, (3) expand protocols to include virtual
and in-person participation, and (4) increase patient adherence and retention.
