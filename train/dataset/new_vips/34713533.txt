The Japanese Society of Travel and Health (JSTH) and the Japanese Society for
Occupational Health (JSOH) have compiled "Novel Coronavirus Information" together
as a joint document, which has been shared with the public on their respective
websites since February 2020. In May 11, 2020, this document was to be published 
as "A Guide for Businesses and Employers Responding to Novel Coronavirus Disease 
(COVID-19)" (hereinafter referred to as "this Guide"). This Guide was prepared
for persons in charge of COVID-19 control measures in their workplace. It should 
be used at the discretion of each business operator according to their workplace 
environment. The examples of infection control measures shown in this Guide are
not guaranteed to work for all situations, and they do not limit or bind actual
measures being put in place. When selecting actual measures, it is necessary to
obtain new information and thoroughly understand individual cases and situations.
This Guide was prepared based on findings and reports about the virus and
response measures taken by the relevant ministries (Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc.) that could be confirmed as of
December 15, 2020. Therefore, the contents of this Guide may need to be modified 
in the future, depending on changes in the situations mentioned above. In the
preparation of this Guide, every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of
currently obtainable information. However, neither JSTH or JSOH shall be held
liable for any unfavorable circumstance, such as loss and damage (including lost 
profits and various expenses), harmful rumors, etc. experienced by a business
operator, his/her employees, and any other persons concerned as a result of
various measures considered/implemented using this Guide by persons responsible
for infection control in the workplace.
