Replication cycles from most simple-stranded positive RNA viruses infecting
plants involve endomembrane deformations. Recent published data revealed several 
interactions between viral proteins and plant proteins associated with vesicle
formation and movement. These plant proteins belong to the COPI/II, SNARE,
clathrin and ESCRT endomembrane trafficking mechanisms. In a few cases,
variations of these plant proteins leading to virus resistance have been
identified. In this review, we summarize all known interactions between these
plant cell mechanisms and viruses and highlight strategies allowing fast
identification of variant alleles for membrane-associated proteins.
