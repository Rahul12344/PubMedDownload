The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has led to enormous challenges in
pediatric dental care. In contrast to adults, many children are without any
symptoms of disease if infected with COVID-19 and are not vaccinated. The aim of 
this study was to conduct an inquiry into the perspective of pediatric dentists
in Germany towards the impact of COVID-19 on daily patient care during the
lockdowns caused by the pandemic. All members of the Germany Society of Pediatric
Dentistry were invited to participate in an online survey. The questionnaire
focused on five topics: safety measures, well-being/knowledge, patient care,
prospects, and demographic data. A total of 549 pediatric dentists participated
(58.11% females, 8.2% males, 0.18% inter/diverse, and 33.51% no answer). In
total, 75.2% of the dental clinics were open during the first lockdown (LD1) and 
78.1% during the second lockdown (LD2). In LD1, only 22.2% were operating at full
capacity, while 40.1% were open with restrictions, and 11.8% only offered
emergency treatment. In LD2, 71.2% of practices were operating again and resumed 
offering all treatment methods. A significant decrease in pediatric patients was 
reported due to the fact of COVID-19. Furthermore, measures, such as oral hygiene
and recall appointments, were reduced. Measures that were performed after the
lockdown were mainly aerosol-generating procedures and extractions as well as
general anesthesia or sedation. The increased willingness to treat in the second 
lockdown has shown that pediatric dentists have adapted to the pandemic
conditions, which seems to be of great importance, especially in view of the
problem of unvaccinated children.
