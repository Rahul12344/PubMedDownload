Viral hepatitis and liver cancer are worldwide health problems, and they have
been called national afflictions in Japan. We have been studying the mechanism of
hepatocarcinogenesis, chiefly using experimental animal models, starting from
clinical observations of patients. Observations of the early development of liver
cancer in young patients with chronic hepatitis B with minimal hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the frequent development of hepatic
steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C, prompted us to study direct roles
of hepatitis viruses B and C in such liver pathogenesis. In addition, our
establishment of a new paradigm, "hepatitis C as a metabolic disease," further
led us to elucidating the mechanism of nonviral, metabolism-associated liver
cancer. Most hepatologists may appreciate a conquest in the war against viral
hepatitis and associated liver cancer. However, even if we conquer the external
enemies, hepatitis viruses B and C, an intrinsic enemy, metabolism-associated
liver disease, would be waiting for us as an alternative cause of liver cancer.
Confrontation of liver cancer has never ended.
