BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 virus testing among first responders and healthcare
personnel who participated in a May-August 2020 serosurvey which assessed spike
protein antibodies (S1 region) provided an opportunity to assess reinfection.
METHODS: Serology survey data were merged with virus testing results from Rhode
Island (March 1, 2020-February 17, 2021) and New York City (March 10-December 14,
2020). Participants with a positive virus test ≥14 days before their serology
test were included. Reinfection was defined as a second positive SARS-CoV-2 test 
result ≥90 days after the first positive test. The association between serostatus
and reinfection was assessed with a proportional hazards model adjusting for
demographics, exposures, and virus testing frequency.
RESULTS: Among 1,572 previously infected persons, 40 (2.5%) were reinfected.
Reinfection differed by serostatus: 8.4% among seronegative versus 1.9% among
seropositive participants (p<0.0001). Most reinfections occurred among Rhode
Island nursing home and corrections (RINHC) personnel (n=30) who were most
frequently tested (mean 30.3 tests versus 4.6 for other Rhode Island and 2.3 for 
New York City participants). The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for reinfection in
seropositive versus seronegative persons was 0.41 (95% CI 0.20, 0.81). Exposure
to a household member with COVID-19 before the serosurvey was also protective
(aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Reinfections were uncommon among previously infected persons over a 
9-month period that preceded widespread variant circulation. Seropositivity
decreased reinfection risk. Lower reinfection risk associated with exposure to a 
household member with COVID-19 before the serosurvey may reflect subsequently
reduced household transmission among members of previously infected households.
