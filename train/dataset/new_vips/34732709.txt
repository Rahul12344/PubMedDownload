The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense RNA virus. How 
the host immune system senses and responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely
unresolved. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the innate immune
response through the cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. SARS-CoV-2
infection induces the cellular level of 2'3'-cGAMP associated with STING
activation. cGAS recognizes chromatin DNA shuttled from the nucleus as a result
of cell-to-cell fusion upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further demonstrate that the
expression of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 from host cells is
sufficient to trigger cytoplasmic chromatin upon cell fusion. Furthermore,
cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway, but not MAVS-mediated viral RNA sensing
pathway, contributes to interferon and pro-inflammatory gene expression upon cell
fusion. Finally, we show that cGAS is required for host antiviral responses
against SARS-CoV-2, and a STING-activating compound potently inhibits viral
replication. Together, our study reported a previously unappreciated mechanism by
which the host innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection, mediated by
cytoplasmic chromatin from the infected cells. Targeting the cytoplasmic
chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway may offer novel therapeutic opportunities in
treating COVID-19. In addition, these findings extend our knowledge in host
defense against viral infection by showing that host cells' self-nucleic acids
can be employed as a "danger signal" to alarm the immune system.
