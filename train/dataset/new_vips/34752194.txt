Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, higher education and library instruction
made the quick and necessary pivot to remote delivery. This report discusses one 
librarian's efforts to address student learning needs, negotiate disciplinary
faculty needs, and provide just-in-time instruction for a Nursing department that
lacked a full-time subject specialist librarian for several years. A
multi-pronged approach was adopted to ensure students had access to
course-specific instructional materials presented on a YouTube-inspired channel, 
research appointments, and the ability to contact the embedded subject librarian.
Next steps, improvements, assessments, and future sustainability are considered.
