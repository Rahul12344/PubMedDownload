OBJECTIVE: To investigate the nursing professionals' biosecurity in confronting
COVID-19.
METHODS: This is a Survey type study. Nursing professionals were invited via
messaging apps, using self-applied data collection forms. The sample selection
(n=693) was non-probabilistic. A descriptive data analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: considering the biosafety aspects in facing COVID-19, 79.0% of the
participants had not received training or considered it insufficient, 69.3%
reported the lack of personal protective equipment during work, and 81.8% did not
feel safe with the internal flux adaptations for handling COVID-19 cases.
CONCLUSION: Continuous and effective nursing team training and personal
protective equipment availability are necessary, as well as internal flow
adjustments for attending suspected or confirmed cases.
