Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and food-borne
diseases worldwide. Thus, a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-implement detection
method for controlling infection and monitoring progression is urgently needed.
In this study, we constructed a novel sandwich-type electrochemical biosensor
integrated with two specific recognition elements (aptamer and peptide) for human
norovirus (HuNoV). The electrochemical biosensor was fabricated using magnetic
covalent organic framework/pillararene heterosupramolecular nanocomposites
(MB@Apt@WP5A@Au@COF@Fe3O4) as the signal probes. The sensor showed high accuracy 
and selectivity. The detection method does not need the extraction and
amplification of virus nucleic acid and has a short turn-around time.
Intriguingly, the proposed biosensor had a limit of detection of 0.84 copy mL-1
for HuNoV, which was the highest sensitivity among published assays. The proposed
biosensor showed higher sensitivity and accuracy compared with
immunochromatographic assay in the detection of 98 clinical specimens. The
biosensor was capable of determining the predominant infection strain of GII.4
and also GII.3 and achieved 74% selectivity for HuNoV GII group. This study
provides a potential method for point-of-care testing and highlights the
integrated utilization of Apt and peptide in sensor construction.
