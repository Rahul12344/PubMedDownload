Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes other
clinically notable viruses such as the 4 dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4).
Distinguishing DENVs from ZIKV using the established serologic assays widely used
for monitoring DENV transmission is difficult because of antibody
cross-reactivity between these closely related flaviviruses. We describe a
modified and improved recombinant envelope domain III-based serologic assay for
detecting ZIKV type-specific antibodies in regions with endemic DENV
transmission. When the assay was used to measure ZIKV seroprevalence in 2017
among children 9-14 years of age living in a region of the Philippines with
endemic DENV transmission, we observed a ZIKV seroprevalence of 18%.
Investigators should consider using the ZIKV envelope domain III-based assay,
which is simple and readily adaptable for use in standard clinical and public
health laboratories, to assess ZIKV seroprevalence in areas with endemic DENV
transmission.
