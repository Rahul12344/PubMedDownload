Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by most of the eukaryotic cells.
Exosomes' components include proteins, lipids, microRNA, circular RNA, long
noncoding RNA, DNA, etc. Exosomes may carry both pro and anti-inflammatory
cargos; however, exosomes are predominantly filled with immunosuppressive cargos 
such as enzymes and microRNAs in chronic inflammation. Exosomes have surfaced as 
essential participants in physiological and pathological intercellular
communication. Exosomes may prevent or promote the formation of an aggressive
tumor and chronic inflammatory microenvironments, thus influencing tumor and
chronic inflammatory progression as well as clinical prognosis. Exosomes, which
transmit many signals that may either enhance or constrain immunosuppression of
lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in tumors, are increasingly becoming
recognized as significant mediators of immune regulation in cancer. In this
review, we outline the function of exosomes as mediators of immunosuppression in 
tumor and chronic inflammatory microenvironments, with the aim to improve cancer 
therapy.
