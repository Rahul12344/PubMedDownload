The importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution cannot be overlooked. Recent
studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 
evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. Here, we
demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a
new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S 
in the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain, which occurred in co-mutations 
Y449S and N501Y, has reduced infectivity compared to that of the original
SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By
tracking the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in more
than 2.2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency 
of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in
Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway,
vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations, like those in Omicron, will
become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's
population is either vaccinated or infected. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 
evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation
mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.
