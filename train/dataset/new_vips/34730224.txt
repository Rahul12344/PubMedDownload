OBJECTIVE: People experiencing homelessness have peculiar characteristics that
make them more vulnerable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) transmission and to more serious forms of Coronavirus Disease 19
(COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infection in the homeless population assisted by the primary care services of the
Eleemosynaria Apostolica, Vatican City.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Persons experiencing homelessness and the volunteers
assisting them were tested for COVID-19 through PCR and antigen rapid test
between October 1st, 2020, and June 5th, 2021, in the clinical facilities of the 
Eleemosynaria Apostolica.
RESULTS: A total of 1665 subjects from 96 different countries in five continents 
were included in the study; age range was 1-90 years. Overall, 2315 COVID-19
tests through nasopharyngeal swab were performed; 1052 Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(PCR) tests and 1263 antigen rapid tests. Nearly 40% of the subjects underwent
both tests (n=650, 39.04%), 402 were tested with PCR test only (24.14%) and 613
with antigen test only (36.8%). PCR tests were negative in 966 cases and positive
in 86 (8.17%), while antigen tests were negative in 1205 cases and positive in 58
(4.59%). The number of positive cases varied over time, with a drastic increase
during the winter months of 2020 and a progressive decrease over 2021. Among
positive cases, 24.41% were symptomatic; symptoms included fever, breathing
difficulties, anosmia/hyposmia, cough, headache, and diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reported an overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
our sample slightly above 8%. Additional data on viral genome through sequencing 
of SARS-CoV-2 in positive cases are of utmost importance to help identify
variants and implement specific infection control measures.
