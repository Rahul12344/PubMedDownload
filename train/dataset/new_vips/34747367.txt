COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) and is more prevalent and severe in
elderly and patients with comorbid diseases (CM). Because chitinase 3-like-1
(CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2
were investigated. Here, we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the
SC2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and viral spike protein
priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging, and that
anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin, and inhibitors of phosphorylation abrogate these ACE2- 
and SPP-inductive events. Human studies also demonstrate that the levels of
circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and patients with CM, where they 
correlate with COVID-19 severity. These studies demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a
potent stimulator of ACE2 and SPP, that this induction is a major mechanism
contributing to the effects of aging during SC2 infection, and that CHI3L1
co-opts the CHI3L1 axis to augment SC2 infection. CHI3L1 plays a critical role in
the pathogenesis of and is an attractive therapeutic target in COVID-19.
