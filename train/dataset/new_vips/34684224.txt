Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) promotes tumor angiogenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
(NPC) by activating store-operated Ca2+ entry. Since such entry has been linked
to stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), we examined whether the virus acts via
STIM1-dependent Ca2+ signaling to promote tumor angiogenesis in NPC. STIM1
expression was detected in NPC cell lines HK1 and CNE2 that were negative or
positive for EBV. STIM1 was knocked down in EBV-positive cells using recombinant 
lentivirus, then cytosolic Ca2+ levels were measured based on fluorescence
resonance energy transfer. Cells were also exposed to epidermal growth factor
(EGF), and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was measured
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Endothelial tube formation was
quantified in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Growth of CNE2-EBV xenografts was
measured in mice, and angiogenesis was assessed based on immunohistochemical
staining against CD31. Paraffin-embedded NPC tissues from patients were assayed
for CD31 and STIM1. EGFR and ERK signaling pathways were assessed in NPC cell
lines. STIM1 expression was higher in EBV-positive than in EBV-negative NPC cell 
lines. STIM1 knockdown in EBV-positive NPC cells significantly reduced Ca2+
influx and VEGF production after EGF treatment. STIM1 knockdown also inhibited
xenograft growth and angiogenesis. Moreover, CD31 expression level was higher in 
EBV-positive than EBV-negative NPC tissues, and high expression of CD31
co-localized with high expression of STIM1 in EBV-positive tissues from NPC
patients. Viral infection of NPC cells led to higher levels of phosphorylated
ERK1/2 after EGF treatment, which STIM1 knockdown partially reversed. Our results
suggest that EBV promotes EGF-induced ERK1/2 signaling by activating
STIM1-dependent Ca2+ signaling, and that blocking such signaling may inhibit
EBV-promoted angiogenesis in NPC.
