COVID-19 is an infectious disease that affects the respiratory system and is
caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported in Wuhan,
China, on December 31, 2019, and has affected the entire world. This pandemic has
caused serious health, economic and social problems. In this situation, the only 
solution to combat COVID-19 is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs
and vaccines to mitigate the virus and develop better antiviral methods and
excellent diagnostic and prevention techniques. With the development of
nanotechnology, nanoparticles are being introduced to control COVID-19. Graphene 
oxide (GO), an oxidized derivative of graphene, is currently used in the medical 
field to treat certain diseases such as cancer. It is characterized by very
important antiviral properties that allow its use in treating certain infectious 
diseases. The GO antiviral mechanism is discussed by the virus inactivation
and/or the host cell receptor or by the physicochemical destruction of viral
species. Moreover, the very high surface/volume ratio of GO allows the fixation
of biomolecules by simple absorption. This paper summarizes the different studies
performed on GO's antiviral activities and discusses GO-based biosensors for
virus detection and approaches for prevention.
