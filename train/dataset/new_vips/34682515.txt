The use of mobile fitness apps has been on the rise for the last decade and
especially during the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which led to the closure of 
gyms and to reduced outdoor mobility. Fitness apps constitute a promising means
for promoting more active lifestyles, although their attrition rates are
remarkable and adherence to their training plans remains a challenge for
developers. The aim of this project was to design an automatic classification of 
users into adherent and non-adherent, based on their training behavior in the
first three months of app usage, for which purpose we proposed an ensemble of
regression models to predict their behaviour (adherence) in the fourth month. The
study was conducted using data from a total of 246 Mammoth Hunters Fitness app
users. Firstly, pre-processing and clustering steps were taken in order to
prepare the data and to categorize users into similar groups, taking into account
the first 90 days of workout sessions. Then, an ensemble approach for regression 
models was used to predict user training behaviour during the fourth month, which
were trained with users belonging to the same cluster. This was used to reach a
conclusion regarding their adherence status, via an approach that combined
affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm, followed by the long short-term
memory (LSTM), rendering the best results (87% accuracy and 85% F1_score). This
study illustrates the suggested the capacity of the system to anticipate future
adherence or non-adherence, potentially opening the door to fitness app creators 
to pursue advanced measures aimed at reducing app attrition.
