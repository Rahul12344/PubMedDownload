Extensive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed the
generation of thousands of mutations within its genome. While several of these
become rare, others largely increase in prevalence, potentially jeopardizing the 
sensitivity of PCR-based diagnostics. Taking advantage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
knowledge, we designed a one-step probe-based multiplex RT-qPCR (OmniSARS2) to
simultaneously detect short fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in ORF1ab, E gene 
and S gene. Comparative genomics of the most common SARS-CoV-2 lineages, other
human betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus, was the basis for this design,
targeting both highly conserved regions across SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variable
or absent in other Coronaviridae viruses. The highest analytical sensitivity of
this method for SARS-CoV-2 detection was 94.2 copies/mL at 95% detection
probability (~1 copy per total reaction volume) for the S gene assay, matching
the most sensitive available methods. In vitro specificity tests, performed using
reference strains, showed no cross-reactivity with other human coronavirus or
common pathogens. The method was compared with commercially available methods and
detected the virus in clinical samples encompassing different SARS-CoV-2
lineages, including B.1, B.1.1, B.1.177 or B.1.1.7 and rarer lineages. OmniSARS2 
revealed a sensitive and specific viral detection method that is less likely to
be affected by lineage evolution oligonucleotide-sample mismatch, of relevance to
ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 molecular diagnostic methods.
