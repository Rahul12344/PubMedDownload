The year 2020 was atypical due to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
(COVID-19), providing a unique opportunity to understand changes in air quality
due to the reduction in urban activity. Therefore, the aim of the present study
was to perform an integrated evaluation on the influence of the effects of the
2020 pandemic on air quality in the city of Fortaleza, investigating levels of
PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NO, SO2, CO, and O3, corresponding health risks, as well as the
influence of meteorological variables and urban activity. In all phases analyzed,
significant reductions were found in NOx, NO, NO2, and CO. A considerable
reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 was found in the early phases, with an increase in
the later phases. These findings are explained by the nearly 50% reduction in
vehicular traffic and the consequent reduction in fossil fuel emissions, mainly
in the partial lockdown and total lockdown periods, as well as reductions in
commercial (stores/shops) and industrial activities. The variation in O3 was
initially non-significant, followed by a considerable increase in the last three 
phases analyzed; this increase was influenced by changes in temperature and the
incidence of sunlight. SO2 concentrations increased in the period studied,
demonstrating that the vehicular fleet, local commerce, and other activities are 
not the predominant sources of this compound. Estimated health risks were reduced
by half during the lockdown period, especially for non-smokers, followed by a
drastic increase in the last three phases. The planetary boundary layer was
positively correlated with O3 and PM10 and negatively correlated with NOx, NO2,
and NO, indicating its influence on the distribution of pollutants in the lower
atmosphere and, consequently, air quality.
