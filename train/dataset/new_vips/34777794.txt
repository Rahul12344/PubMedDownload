Introduction: A small portion of Corona Virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases
associated with co-infections, however occasionally they turn out to be false
positive due to possible cross-reactivities. The current report aims to present a
rare case of false-positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a COVID-19
patient.
Case report: A 32-year-old female complaining from thyroid problems referred for 
thyroid operation. She had mild symptoms of COVID-19. Her preoperative laboratory
findings were normal, except for HIV screening test which was repetitively
positive. RNA PCR was performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV, it revealed a
negative result. The patient underwent thyroidectomy as planned and was given the
required supportive treatment to recover from COVID-19. Two-month follow up
revealed that she was negative for COVID-19 on PCR testing, and HIV immunoassay
test was no longer positive.
Discussion: Due to structural similarities between the spike protein chains of
SARS-CoV-2 and some other viruses such as dengue, Zika, and other closely related
coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), the protein can potentially interfere with
the immunoassay tests. Although HIV immunoassay tests have high sensitivity and
specificity, false-positive results have been reported, such as in the case of
Epstein Barr virus, Influenza vaccination, and the Australian COVID-19
vaccination.
Conclusion: Similarity between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can lead to
antibody cross-reactivities, yielding false-positive results on immunoassay
screening tests.
