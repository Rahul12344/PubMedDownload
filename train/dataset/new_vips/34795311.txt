The dynamics of epidemics depend on how people's behavior changes during an
outbreak. At the beginning of the epidemic, people do not know about the virus,
then, after the outbreak of epidemics and alarm, they begin to comply with the
restrictions and the spreading of epidemics may decline. Over time, some people
get tired/frustrated by the restrictions and stop following them (exhaustion),
especially if the number of new cases drops down. After resting for a while, they
can follow the restrictions again. But during this pause the second wave can come
and become even stronger then the first one. Studies based on SIR models do not
predict the observed quick exit from the first wave of epidemics. Social dynamics
should be considered. The appearance of the second wave also depends on social
factors. Many generalizations of the SIR model have been developed that take into
account the weakening of immunity over time, the evolution of the virus,
vaccination and other medical and biological details. However, these more
sophisticated models do not explain the apparent differences in outbreak profiles
between countries with different intrinsic socio-cultural features. In our work, 
a system of models of the COVID-19 pandemic is proposed, combining the dynamics
of social stress with classical epidemic models. Social stress is described by
the tools of sociophysics. The combination of a dynamic SIR-type model with the
classical triad of stages of the general adaptation syndrome,
alarm-resistance-exhaustion, makes it possible to describe with high accuracy the
available statistical data for 13 countries. The sets of kinetic constants
corresponding to optimal fit of model to data were found. These constants
characterize the ability of society to mobilize efforts against epidemics and
maintain this concentration over time and can further help in the development of 
management strategies specific to a particular society.
