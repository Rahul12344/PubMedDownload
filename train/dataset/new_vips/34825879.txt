BACKGROUND & AIM: COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic with high rates of morbidity
and mortality, and an uncertain prognosis leading to an increased risk of
infection in health providers and limited hospital care capacities. In this
study, we have proposed a predictive, interpretable prognosis scoring system with
the use of readily obtained clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics
to accurately predict worsening of the condition and overall survival of patients
with COVID -19.
METHODS: This is a single-center, observational, prospective, cohort study. A
total of 347 patients infected with COVID-19 presenting to the Tanta university
hospital, Egypt, were enrolled in the study, and clinical, radiological and
laboratory data were analyzed. Top-ranked variables were identified and selected 
to be integrated into a Cox regression model, building the scoring system for
accurate prediction of the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.
RESULTS: The six variables that were finally selected in the scoring system were 
lymphopenia, serum CRP, ferritin, D-Dimer, radiological CT lung findings and
associated chronic debilitating disease. The scoring system discriminated risk
groups with either mild disease or severe illness characterized by respiratory
distress (and also those with hypoxia and in need for oxygen therapy or
mechanical ventilation) or death. The area under the curve to estimate the
discrimination performance of the scoring system was more than 90%.
CONCLUSION: We proposed a simple and clinically useful predictive scoring model
for COVID-19 patients. However, additional independent validation will be
required before the scoring model can be used commonly.
