The documentation of several recent outbreaks of human virus diseases associated 
with the consumption of shellfish has reiterated the threat posed by these agents
to the shellfish industry. This article reviews pertinent outbreaks, identifies
principal viral agents involved, and delineates systems which may be at greatest 
risk. The results of two recent laboratory studies which sought to define
environmental factors that contribute to virus accumulation by shellfish are also
discussed. First, the accumulation of environmentally significant levels of
feces-associated and monodispersed poliovirus by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) 
and clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) was investigated. The results of this study
suggested that virus accumulation by mollusks may not be significant when water
column concentrations are below ⋍0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. 
The second study focused on the relative contributions of undisturbed sediments
versus those in the water column in the accumulation of viruses by epifaunal and 
infaunal shellfish (C. virginica and M. mercenaria). Viruses were found to be
most efficiently accumulated when suspended in the water column.
