Resistance to anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) drugs has been a problem
from the beginning of antiviral drug treatments. The recent expansion of
combination antiretroviral therapy worldwide has led to an increase in resistance
to antiretrovirals; understanding the mechanisms of resistance is increasingly
important. In this study, we analyzed reverse transcriptase (RT) variants based
on sequences derived from an individual who had a low-level rebound viremia while
undergoing therapy with abacavir, azidothymidine (AZT or Zidovudine), and
(-)-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (Lamivudine or 3TC). The RT had mutations at 
positions 64, 67, 70, 184, 219, and a threonine insertion after amino acid 69 in 
RT. The virus remained partially susceptible to the nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. We show how these mutations affect the
ability of NRTIs to inhibit DNA synthesis by RT. The presence of the inserted
threonine reduced the susceptibility of the RT mutant to inhibition by Tenofovir.
