Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) causing bunchy top disease, is one of the most
devastating diseases of banana and plantain. All the six genomic components of
isolates from different parts of the world have been well characterised, with
most of the studies focusing on replicase gene and coat protein gene.
Overexpression of coat protein (CP) in Escherichia coli system can contribute
significantly in structural as well as immunological studies. In the present
investigation, the full length BBTV CP was cloned to pGEX-4T-2 expression vector 
and overexpressed in various Escherichia coli strains to obtain high quality and 
quantity of the CP. An augmented overexpression and stability of recombinant coat
protein was achieved by molecular manipulation of the clone by restriction-free
(RF) cloning platform. The RF cloning was employed to replace the thrombin
cleavage site in the vector backbone, which was also present in the protein of
interest, and to incorporate TEV protease site to cleave fusion protein at this
specific site, and separate the affinity tag. The RF method allows direct
transformation of the PCR product to undergo ligation in vivo and obtain the
transformants thereby avoiding the restriction digestion and ligation of the
product to the linearized plasmid. From a litre culture, 1.084 mg/ml of fusion
protein with GST tag was obtained after GSH sepharose affinity column
chromatography. The fluorescence spectra indicated partial disordered tertiary
structure of the fusion protein. Cleavage of tag was attempted using TEV protease
overexpressed and purified in the laboratory.Supplementary Information: The
