Prognostic Value of Complete Blood Cell Count-Derived Inflammatory Markers in
Hepatitis B Virus-Related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.

BACKGROUND: Development and progression of HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver
failure (HBV-ACLF) are associated with inflammatory responses. We aimed to
explore the utility of blood cell count-derived inflammatory markers (white blood
cell, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, red cell distribution width, and
monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio [MLR]) as prognostic index in HBV-ACLF patients.
METHODS: A total of 160 HBV-ACLF patients were included in this retrospective
study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors
of poor outcomes, and the performance of these predictors was evaluated by
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients died within 28 days after admission. MLR was markedly
higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Moreover, MLR was an independent
predictor for 28-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study found that MLR is a simple and accurate
prognostic index for mortality in HBV-ACLF patients and can serve as a screening 
tool for prediction of poor outcomes in these patients.
