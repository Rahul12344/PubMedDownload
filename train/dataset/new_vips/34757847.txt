Although a broad range of viruses cause myocarditis, the mechanisms that underlie
viral myocarditis are poorly understood. Here, we report that the M2 gene is a
determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein Î¼1,
which mediates host membrane penetration during reovirus entry. We infected
newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant
reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted
into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was non-lethal in wild-type
mice, whereas greater than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection.
T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In
secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached
higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice
were grossly abnormal, with large lesions indicative of substantial inflammatory 
infiltrate. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained necrotic cardiomyocytes 
with pyknotic debris, and extensive lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In
contrast, T1L induced the formation of small purulent lesions in a small subset
of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated
caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with
T1L/T3DM2 compared to T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of
the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to
change a non-lethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further
indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which
potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis. IMPORTANCE Reovirus is
a non-enveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as 
a model for studying viral myocarditis. The mechanisms by which reovirus drives
myocarditis development are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting the 
M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L)
genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the non-lethal T1L
strain into a lethal infection in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. T1L/T3DM2 disseminated
more efficiently and reached higher maximum titers than T1L in all organs tested,
including the heart. T1L is mildly myocarditic and induced small areas of cardiac
inflammation in a subset of mice. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with
T1L/T3DM2 contained extensive cardiac inflammatory infiltration and more
activated caspase-3-positive cells, which is indicative of apoptosis. Together,
our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of
reovirus-induced myocarditis.
