Cryphonectria is a fungal genus associated with economically significant disease 
of trees. Herein we characterized a novel double-stranded RNA virus from the
fungal species Cryphonectria naterciae, a species unexplored as a virus host. De 
novo assembly of RNA-seq data and Sanger sequencing of RACE (rapid amplification 
of cDNA ends) clones gave the complete, non-segmented genome (10,164 bp) of the
virus termed Cryphonectria naterciae fusagravirus (CnFGV1) that was
phylogenetically placed within the previously proposed viral family
Fusagraviridae. Of 31 field-collected strains of C. naterciae, 40% tested
CnFGV1-positive. Cocultivation resulted in within-species transmission of CnFGV1 
to virus-free strains of C. naterciae. Comparison of the mycelium phenotype and
the growth rate of CnFGV1-infected and virus-free isogenic strains revealed
frequent sectoring and growth reduction in C. naterciae upon virus infection.
Co-culturing also led to cross-species transmission of CnFGV1 to Cryphonectria
carpinicola and Cryphonectria radicalis, but not to Cryphonectria parasitica. The
virus-infected C. naterciae and the experimentally infected Cryphonectria spp.
readily transmitted CnFGV1 through asexual spores to the next generation. CnFGV1 
strongly reduced conidiation and in some cases vegetative growth of C.
carpinicola, which is involved in the European hornbeam disease. This study is
the first report of a fusagravirus in the family Cryphonectriaceae and lays the
groundwork for assessing a hypovirulence effect of CnFGV1 against the hornbeam
decline in Europe.
