Transmission Dynamics of Large Coronavirus Disease Outbreak in Homeless Shelter, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2020.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential
for rapid transmission in congregate settings. We describe the multidisciplinary 
response to an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a large homeless
shelter in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The response to the outbreak included 4 rounds
of mass PCR testing of all staff and residents and subsequent isolation of
persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We further describe the dynamics of
the shelter outbreak by fitting a modified
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental model incorporating the
widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing and isolation measures implemented in this shelter.
Our model demonstrates that rapid transmission of COVID-19 in the shelter
occurred before the outbreak was detected; rates of transmission declined after
widespread testing and isolation measures were put in place. Overall, we
demonstrate the feasibility of mass PCR testing and isolation in congregate
settings and suggest the necessity of prompt response to suspected COVID-19
outbreaks in homeless shelters.
