Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory skin disease.
Case reports of individuals with hidradenitis suppurativa presenting exclusively 
on the face, as well as reports of individuals with HIV and hidradenitis
suppurativa, are rare. Here, we present the case of an HIV-positive man who
presented with hidradenitis suppurativa localized only on his face. We also
review facial hidradenitis suppurativa and hidradenitis suppurativa in HIV
patients.
