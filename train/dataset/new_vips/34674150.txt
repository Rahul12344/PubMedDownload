Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which is a neural peptide, has been reported 
to confer cardioprotective effects. However, whether CNTF-based gene delivery
could prevent cardiac remodeling in diabetes mellitus remains unknown. In this
study, we used adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-based cardiac gene
delivery to test the effects of CNTF overexpression on adverse ventricular
remodeling in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice models. Postnatal
(P3-P10) mice were peritoneally injected with AAV9 recombinant virus carrying the
CNTF gene or EGFP gene. Then, type 1 diabetic models were established by
peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) in 7-week-old female mice
injected with AAV9. 4 weeks later after the establishment of type 1 diabetes
mellitus, mouse hearts were removed to assess the degree of cardiac remodeling.
We found that CNTF overexpression in mouse cardiomyocytes exacerbated cell
apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis coupled with an increased inflammatory response in
the heart tissue of diabetic female mice. Taken together, our results suggested
that cardiac CNTF gene delivery may not be beneficial in alleviating adverse
cardiac remodeling in type 1 diabetes female mice.
