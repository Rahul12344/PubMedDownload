In line with the Latin expression "sed parva forti" meaning "small but mighty,"
the family Parvoviridae contains many of the smallest known viruses, some of
which result in fatal or debilitating infections. In recent years, advances in
metagenomic viral discovery techniques have dramatically increased the
identification of novel parvoviruses in both diseased and healthy individuals.
While some of these discoveries have solved etiologic mysteries of well-described
diseases in animals, many of the newly discovered parvoviruses appear to cause
mild or no disease, or disease associations remain to be established. With the
increased use of animal parvoviruses as vectors for gene therapy and oncolytic
treatments in humans, it becomes all the more important to understand the
diversity, pathogenic potential, and evolution of this diverse family of viruses.
In this review, we discuss parvoviruses infecting vertebrate animals, with a
special focus on pathogens of veterinary significance and viruses discovered
within the last four years.
