Background: Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) are considered risk enhancing
factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, sparse data exist regarding
relative CHD risks across CIDs. Objective: Determine relative differences in CHD 
risk across multiple CIDs: psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), systemic sclerosis
(SSc), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: The cohort included
patients with CIDs and controls without CID in an urban medical system from 2000 
to 2019. Patients with CIDs were frequency-matched with non-CID controls on
demographics, hypertension, and diabetes. CHD was defined as myocardial
infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease, and/or coronary revascularization based 
on validated administrative codes. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models were used to
determine the risk of incident CHD and MI for each CID relative to non-CID
controls. In secondary analyses, we compared CHD risk by disease severity within 
each CID. Results: Of 17,049 patients included for analysis, 619 had incident CHD
(202 MI) over an average of 4.4 years of follow-up. The multivariable-adjusted
risk of CHD was significantly higher for SLE [hazard ratio (HR) 1.9, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 3.2] and SSc (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2, 3.9). Patients
with SLE also had a significantly higher risk of MI (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9, 6.8).
When CIDs were categorized by markers of disease severity (C-reactive protein for
all CIDs except HIV, for which CD4 T cell count was used), greater disease
severity was associated with higher CHD risk across CIDs. Conclusions: Patients
with SLE and SSc have a higher risk of CHD. CHD risk with HIV, RA, psoriasis, and
IBD may only be elevated in those with greater disease severity. Clinicians
should personalize CHD risk and treatment based on type and severity of CID.
