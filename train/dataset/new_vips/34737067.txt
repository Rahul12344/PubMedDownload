Disruption of CCR5 or CXCR4, the main human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
co-receptors, has been shown to protect primary human CD4+ T cells from HIV-1
infection. Base editing can install targeted point mutations in cellular genomes,
and can thus efficiently inactivate genes by introducing stop codons or
eliminating start codons without double-stranded DNA break formation. Here, we
applied base editors for individual and simultaneous disruption of both
co-receptors in primary human CD4+ T cells. Using cytosine base editors we
observed premature stop codon introduction in up to 89% of sequenced CCR5 or
CXCR4 alleles. Using adenine base editors we eliminated the start codon in CCR5
in up to 95% of primary human CD4+ T cell and up to 88% of CD34+ hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cell target alleles. Genome-wide specificity analysis
revealed low numbers of off-target mutations that were introduced by base
editing, located predominantly in intergenic or intronic regions. We show that
our editing strategies prevent transduction with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic
viral vectors in up to 79% and 88% of human CD4+ T cells, respectively. The
engineered T cells maintained functionality and overall our results demonstrate
the effectiveness of base-editing strategies for efficient and specific ablation 
of HIV co-receptors in clinically relevant cell types.
