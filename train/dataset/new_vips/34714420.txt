BACKGROUND: The coexistence of cirrhosis complicates the early detection of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, novel biomarkers for HCC early detection
are needed urgently. Traditionally, HCC detection is carried out by
evaluating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels combined with imaging techniques. This 
work aimed to assess interleukin (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) 
as possible HCC markers in comparison to AFP in patients with and without HCC.
RESULTS: ROC analysis showed that IGF2 had the highest area under the curve (AUC)
for discriminating HCC from liver cirrhosis (0.86), followed by IL6 (0.82), AFP
(0.72), and platelet count (0.6). A four-marker model was developed and
discriminated HCC from liver cirrhosis with an AUC of 0.97. The best cut-off was 
1.28, at which sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 85%, respectively. For
small tumor (< 2 cm), the model had an AUC of 0.95 compared to AFP (0.72). Also, 
the model achieved perfect performance with AUC of 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95 for BCLC 
(0-A), CLIP (0-1), and Okuda (stage I), respectively, compared to AFP (AUC of
0.71, 0.69, and 0.67, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The four markers may serve as a diagnostic model for HCC early
stages and help overcome AFP poor sensitivity.
