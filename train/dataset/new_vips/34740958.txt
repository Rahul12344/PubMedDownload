Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an important regulator of glucose
metabolism and inflammatory cytokine production in innate immune responses.
Viruses modulate HIF-1α to support viral replication and the survival of infected
cells, but it is unclear if this transcription factor also plays an important
role in regulating antiviral immune responses. In this study, we found that short
and long dsRNA differentially engage TLR3, inducing distinct levels of
proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α and IL-6) in bone marrow-derived
macrophages from C57BL/6 mice. These responses are associated with differential
accumulation of HIF-1α, which augments NF-κB activation. Unlike TLR4 responses,
increased HIF-1α following TLR3 engagement is not associated with significant
alterations in glycolytic activity and was more pronounced in low glucose
conditions. We also show that the mechanisms supporting HIF-1α stabilization may 
differ following stimulation with short versus long dsRNA and that pyruvate
kinase M2 and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species play a central role in these 
processes. Collectively, this work suggests that HIF-1α may fine-tune
proinflammatory cytokine production during early antiviral immune responses,
particularly when there is limited glucose availability or under other conditions
of stress. Our findings also suggest we may be able to regulate the magnitude of 
proinflammatory cytokine production during antiviral responses by targeting
proteins or molecules that contribute to HIF-1α stabilization.
