BACKGROUND AND AIM: From March 17 to April 17, 2020, the Portuguese municipality 
of Ovar was submitted to a cordon sanitaire due to a COVID-19 outbreak. During
this period a whole Public Health structure had to be built up to respond to the 
healthcare needs of the population. The aim of this work is to contribute to the 
evidence on the efficacy of cordon sanitaire as an epidemic control strategy.
METHODS: All the major institutions in Ovar, both health and socially related,
were called from the first day to form a Crisis Cabinet. Case tracking was
assured by the creation of an online database. A major telephone network oversaw 
contact tracing, isolation mandates and surveillance. A massive testing structure
was built up, and clinical assistance was assured by the local hospital and the
Primary Care units. Patient referral to testing and clinical visits were made
through online forms that allowed an efficient response and data for
epidemiologic research.
RESULTS: A decline in the daily number of cases was seen after an incubation
period (14 days), confirming lockdown was effective in blocking transmission
chains. Besides, neighbouring municipalities were not significantly affected in
relation to others. Lethality was bigger in Ovar than in whole Portugal.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the incidence, in the reproductive number and the
non-affection of neighbouring municipalities appear to prove the cordon sanitaire
as an effective Public Health measure to contain epidemics. However, an
appropriate mitigation strategy must be adopted to conceal the challenge.
