BACKGROUND: Pneumonia due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is 
spreading rapidly all over the world and air travel is the leading transmission
route of the virus among countries. The aim of the study is to determine the
frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in aircrew, to
determine occupational exposure, and to understand the spread of immunity in
social groups.
METHOD: The study was designed as a cross-sectional retrospective study.
SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in patients who applied to between December
1, 2020 and January 13, 2021. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity was investigated
before December 1, 2020.
RESULTS: The patients were divided into three groups according to their jobs such
as 313 aircrew; 451 healthcare workers; 4258 other patients. The PCR positivity
rate was found to be 39% in the aircrew group, 32% in the healthcare workers and 
%20 other patient group (p < 0.001). The IgG antibody positivity rate was 46% in 
the aircrew, 41% in healthcare workers, and 35.3% in the other patient group
(p < 0.001).The group with the highest IgG antibody titer is in the aircrew;
there was a significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, it was observed that aircrew, similar to healthcare
workers, are at serious risk against SARS-CoV-2. In this process, it is suggested
that the vaccination processes included repeated doses of aircrew should be
accelerated and protective measures and equipment should be increased in terms of
reinfection.
