BACKGROUND: HIV and HBV infections remain responsible for high rate of morbidity 
and mortality in many African Countries, affecting women and newborns. This study
aims to analyze the spatial pattern of HIV and HBV infections in pregnant women
in Luanda, Angola, and the statistical association between HIV and HBV and
socio-economic characteristics, hygiene, and health status.
METHODS: Detection of anti-HIV antibodies (total anti-HIV-1, anti-HIV-2 and HIV-1
p24 antigen) and Hepatitis B antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) and antibodies (anti-HBc
Total II, HBc IgM, Anti-HBsT II) was performed by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay
(ELFA) in serum samples of 878 pregnant women attended at the Lucrecia Paim
Maternity Hospital (LPMH). Data were collected by questionnaire after written
consent, and spatial distribution was assessed through a Kernel Density Function.
The potential risk factors associated with HIV HBV infection were evaluated using
bivariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Anti-HIV antibodies were positive in 118 samples (13.4%) and HBV
infection were positive in 226 (25.7%). The seroprevalence of HIV/HBV coinfection
was of 6.3%. The results showed that the seroprevalence of HBV was similar in
most municipalities: 25.8% in Belas; 26.6% in Viana; 27.6% in Luanda; 19.2% in
Cacuaco; and 15.6% Cazenga. For HIV, the seroprevalence was also close ranges
among the municipalities: 10.0% in Belas; 14.5% in Viana 14.9% in Luanda and
12.5% in Cazenga. However, the seroprevalence in municipality of in Cacuaco was
lower (5.8%) and bivariate and multivariate analysis showed a lower risk for HIV 
in this area (OR 0.348, CI 0.083-0.986; OR 0.359, CI 0.085-1.021). The
multivariate analysis had also showed a significant increased risk for HIV in
women with 2 or 3 births (OR 1.860, CI 1.054-3.372).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results underlined the need to improve the screening and
clinical follow-up of HIV and HBV in Angola, as well the educational campaigns to
prevent not only the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases, but 
also their transmission, mainly in women in reproductive age and pregnant,
encouraging the pre-natal consultations in order to avoid mother-to-child
transmission.
