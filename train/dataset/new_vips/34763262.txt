The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has
resulted in millions of worldwide deaths. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged from 
Wuhan, China in December 2019, reports of patients with COVID-19 revealed that
hospitalized patients had acute changes in mental status, cognition, and
encephalopathy. Neurologic complications can be a consequence from overall
severity of the systemic infection, direct viral invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
in the central nervous system, and possible immune mediated mechanisms. We will
examine the landscape regarding this topic in this review in addition to current 
understandings of COVID-19 and hemostasis, treatment, and prevention, as well as 
vaccination.
