A novel Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage PMBT4 was isolated from the
Nigerian fermented milk product nono. The phage possesses a long and thin,
non-contractile tail and an isometric head, indicating that it belongs to the
Siphoviridae family. A neck passage structure (`collar`), previously hypothesized
to be encoded by two genes located in the Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-K
insertion sequence (KIS) element, as well as in two additional Lb. delbrueckii
phages Ld17 and Ld25A, could also be observed on an estimated 1-5% of phage
particles by transmission electron microscopy. However, neither mapping of high
throughput sequencing data to KIS element genes from Lb. delbrueckii phages LL-K,
Ld17 and Ld25A nor PCR amplification of the KIS element genes could corroborate
the presence of these genes in the PMBT4 genome. The PMBT4 genome consists of
31,399 bp with a mol% GC content of 41.6 and exhibits high (95-96%) sequence
homologies to Lb. delbrueckii phages c5, Ld3, Ld25A and Ld17, which assigned
PMBT4 as a new member of this genus, i.e. the Cequinquevirus genus.
