INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of people
worldwide and is caused by infection from the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 pathogen. While COVID-19 most commonly affects the respiratory
system, multiple neurological complications have been associated with this
pathogen. We report a case of Wernicke encephalopathy in a young girl with poor
oral intake secondary to anosmia and dysgeusia after a COVID-19 infection.
CASE REPORT: After a recent infection of COVID-19, a 15-year-old girl developed
an overwhelming noxious metallic tase resulting in a 30 lb weight loss from being
unable to tolerate oral foods. She presented to the hospital 3 months later with 
bilateral horizontal conjugate gaze palsies, up beating vertical nystagmus,
difficulty with limb coordination and gait ataxia. She was found to have a
thiamine level of 51 nmol/L (reference range: 70 to 180 nmol/L) and her brain
magnetic resonance imaging showed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and
diffusion-weighted imaging changes in the periaqueductal gray and dorsomedial
thalami suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy. She was started on parenteral
thiamine replacement and had significant neurological improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: As this pandemic continues to progress, more long-term neurological 
sequelae from COVID-19 such as Wernicke encephalopathy can be expected. Strong
clinical suspicion for these complications is needed to allow for earlier
diagnosis and faster treatment initiation.
