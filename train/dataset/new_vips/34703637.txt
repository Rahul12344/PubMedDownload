Objective: Bacterial co-infections in cases of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) can lead to less favourable outcomes. The aim of this study was to
determine the prevalence of primary bacterial co-infections among patients with
COVID-19 in Brunei Darussalam.
Methods: Seventy-one of 180 patients admitted to the National Isolation Centre
between 9 March 2020 and 4 February 2021 were screened for primary bacterial
co-infection (infection occurring £48 hour from admission). We compared patients 
with a primary bacterial co-infection to those without.
Results: Of the 71 screened patients, 8 (11.2%) had a primary bacterial
co-infection (sputum 37.5% [6/16], blood 2.8% [1/36], urine 1.7% [1/60]), for a
period prevalence rate of 4.4% (respiratory tract infection 3.3% [6/180],
bloodstream 0.6% [1/180], urine 0.6% [1/180]) among all COVID-19 patients. Older 
age, presence of comorbidity, symptoms at admission (fever, dyspnoea,
nausea/vomiting), abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) and more severe COVID-19 (P < 0.05) 
were associated with primary bacterial co-infection. Primary bacterial
co-infection was also associated with development of secondary infection and
death (all P < 0.05). Only one patient with primary bacterial co-infection died
(methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia and multiorgan failure).
Conclusion: Our study showed that primary bacterial co-infection affected 4.4% of
patients with COVID-19 in Brunei Darussalam. Older age, presence of comorbidity, 
symptoms and abnormal CXR at admission and more severe disease were associated
with a primary bacterial co-infection. Lower respiratory tract infection was the 
most common co-infection.
