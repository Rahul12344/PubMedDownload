Due to the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rapid and accurate diagnostic
tools are needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. An
electrochemical sensing platform was constructed using CNTs/WO3-screen printed
electrodes for imprinting the complete virus particles (SARS-CoV-2 particles)
within the polymeric matrix to create viral complementary binding sites. The
sensor provided high selectivity toward the target virus over other tested human 
corona and influenza respiratory interference viruses. The sensitivity
performance of the sensor chips was evaluated using different viral
concentrations, while the limits of detection and quantification were 57 and 175 
pg/mL, respectively. Reaching this satisfied low detection limit (almost 27-fold 
more sensitive than the RT-PCR), the sensor was applied in clinical specimens
obtained from SARS-CoV-2 suspected cases. Thus, dealing directly with clinical
samples on the chip could be provided as a portable device for instantaneous and 
simple point of care in hospitals, airports, and hotspots.
