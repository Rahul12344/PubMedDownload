The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of
the Coronaviridae family, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic followed
by unprecedented global societal and economic disruptive impact. The innate
immune system is the body's first line of defense against invading pathogens and 
is induced by a variety of cellular receptors that sense viral components.
However, various strategies are exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt the antiviral 
innate immune responses. Innate immune dysfunction is characterized by the weak
generation of type I interferons (IFNs) and the hypersecretion of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to mortality and organ injury in patients
with COVID-19. This review summarizes the existing understanding of the mutual
effects between SARS-CoV-2 and the type I IFN (IFN-α/β) responses, emphasizing
the relationship between host innate immune signaling and viral proteases with an
insight on tackling potential therapeutic targets.
