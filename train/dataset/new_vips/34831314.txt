Chronic infections with either hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) are among the 
most common risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The
hepatocarcinogenic potential of these viruses is mediated through a wide range of
mechanisms, including the induction of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress 
and the deregulation of cellular pathways by viral proteins. Over the last
decade, effective anti-viral agents have made sustained viral suppression or cure
a feasible treatment objective for most chronic HBV/HCV patients. Given the
tumorigenic potential of HBV/HCV, it is no surprise that obtaining sustained
viral suppression or eradication proves to be effective in preventing HCC. This
review summarizes the mechanisms by which HCV and HBV exert their
hepatocarcinogenic activity and describes in detail the efficacy of anti-HBV and 
anti-HCV therapies in terms of HCC prevention. Although these treatments
significantly reduce the risk for HCC in patients with chronic viral hepatitis,
this risk is not eliminated. Therefore, we evaluate potential strategies to
improve these outcomes further and address some of the remaining controversies.
