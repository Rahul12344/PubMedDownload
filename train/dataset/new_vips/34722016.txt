INTRODUCTION:  Some studies have highlighted the effect of COVID-19 infection on 
the quality of sleep; however, the data is limited. In this study, we
investigated the prevalence of insomnia in patients who recently recovered from
the COVID-19 infection to evaluate the prevalence and extent of its impact.
METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted from January 2021 to March 2021. A
total of 500 patients admitted to the intensive care unit or isolation unit of
COVID-19 were included in the study at the time of their discharge. The
pre-COVID-19 sleep quality of the participants was inquired using the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Post-COVID sleep quality was assessed at a 30-day
follow-up. Sleep quality was considered poor if the global score was ≥5.
Participants that failed to follow up were not included in the study.
RESULTS: The mean PSQI score was significantly higher in the post-COVID-19 group 
compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (6.28 ± 2.11 vs. 3.22 ± 0.80;
p-value <0.0001). The percentage of participants with a PSQI score of ≥5 was
significantly higher in the post-COVID-19 group compared to the pre-COVID-19
group (45.1% vs. 12.1%; p-value <0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Insomnia has a significant prevalence in recovered COVID-19
patients after 30 days of follow-up. Hence, patients need to be counseled to
follow up in case they experience poor sleep. To avoid the long-term negative
impact on patients experiencing insomnia, timely identification and treatment are
important.
