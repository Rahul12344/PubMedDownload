Background: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the lung is a rare type of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and researches of it are still not enough.
Methods: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with LELC
diagnosed in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Zhaoqing
First People's Hospital from January 2014 to June 2021, to investigate the
clinical manifestations, tumor markers, treatment, and prognosis of LELC.
Clinical data including age, gender, smoking history, family history of cancers, 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoding RNA (EBER) status, gene mutations, programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, treatment, and prognosis.
Results: There was a total of 36 participants in this study, 16 males and 20
females, the median age was 57 years (37-76 years). A total of 22 cases (61.1%)
were advanced (stage III and IV), and EBER was 94.4% positive. Most patients were
treated with surgery, platinum chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. At the time of 31
June 2021, 33 participants had survived, and the longest survival time was 72
months. Lung LELC was more common in old participants (â‰¥59 years) and was not
associated with smoking history. Expression of PD-L1 was positive in the majority
(27 cases, 75%) and participants with positive PD-L1 expression tended to have
longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) time than those 
with negative PD-L1 expression.
Conclusions: Pulmonary LELC usually occurs in non-smoking patients and is
associated with EBV infection. Common treatments for tumors include multimodal
therapy. The expression of PD-1 may be related to the prognosis of LELC, but more
studies are needed to support further optimization of the treatment of LELC.
