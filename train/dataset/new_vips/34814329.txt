In this work, Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs) models were
implemented based on both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit 
(GRU) cells in order to distinguish between genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and
other Corona Virus strains such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Common Cold and other
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) viruses. An investigation of the
hyper-parameters including the optimizer type and the number of unit cells, was
also performed to attain the best performance of the BRNN models. Results showed 
that the GRU BRNNs model was able to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other
classes of viruses with a higher overall classification accuracy of 96.8% as
compared to that of the LSTM BRNNs model having a 95.8% overall classification
accuracy. The best hyper-parameters producing the highest performance for both
models was obtained when applying the SGD optimizer and an optimum number of unit
cells of 80 in both models. This study proved that the proposed GRU BRNN model
has a better classification ability for SARS-CoV-2 thus providing an efficient
tool to help in containing the disease and achieving better clinical decisions
with high precision.
