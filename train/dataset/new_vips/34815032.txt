African swine fever (ASF) is a swine viral disease that could cause highly
contagious and extremely high mortality, causing huge economic losses to the pig 
industry. As there is currently no vaccine and effective treatment methods.
Therefore, early monitoring is one of the most important solutions to prevent and
control ASF. In this study, the dual QDM recombinant virus protein 30 and 54 (P30
and P54) probes and pre-incubation in vitro were proposed for the first time as
QDM based-ASFV immunosensor (QAIS) for the ultra-sensitive quantitative detection
of ASFV antibodies in serum. In the range from serum dilution of 1:1000 to
1:64000, it showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9947), and its detection
sensitivity was 1:64000 dilution. Compared with commercial enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip
(CGICS), its detection sensitivity was improved by at least one order of
magnitude and four orders of magnitude respectively. In addition, the whole ASFV 
antibody screening test can be completed in 25 min with simple operation. The
performance and practicability of the established QAIS sensor have been verified 
by ASF-ELISA kit, and its coincidence rate was as high as 98.7% in 151 clinical
samples. We firmly believe that the proposed QAIS sensor could potentially be
applied to point-of-care testing (POCT) for quantitative ASFV antibody in pig
farms.
