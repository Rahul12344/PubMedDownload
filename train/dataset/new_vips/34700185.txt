Phyllosphere or aerial surface of plants represents the globally largest and
peculiar microbial habitat that inhabits diverse and rich communities of
bacteria, fungi, viruses, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, nematodes, and
protozoans. These hyperdiverse microbial communities are related to the host's
specific functional traits and influence the host's physiology and the
ecosystem's functioning. In the last few years, significant advances have been
made in unravelling several aspects of phyllosphere microbiology, including
diversity and microbial community composition, dynamics, and functional
interactions. This review highlights the current knowledge about the assembly,
structure, and composition of phyllosphere microbial communities across
spatio-temporal scales, besides functional significance of different microbial
communities to the plant host and the surrounding environment. The knowledge will
help develop strategies for modelling and manipulating these highly beneficial
microbial consortia for furthering scientific inquiry into their interactions
with the host plants and also for their useful and economic utilization.
