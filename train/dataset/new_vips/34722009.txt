Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy can safely treat hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related
decompensated cirrhosis and has been shown to improve liver function at an early 
stage. However, the pathophysiology of the liver during treatment remains
unclear. In this case report, we analyzed hepatic morphology on magnetic
resonance imaging during the treatment period and confirmed that liver function
and malnutrition were greatly improved with the elimination of HCV, and that
rapid hemodynamic changes were occurring in the liver.
