African swine fever (ASF) is currently the most dangerous disease for the global 
pig industry, causing huge economic losses, due to the lack of effective vaccine 
or treatment. Only the early detection of ASF virus (ASFV) and proper biosecurity
measures are effective to reduce the viral expansion. One of the most widely
recognized risks as regards the introduction ASFV into a country is infected
animals and contaminated livestock vehicles. In order to improve ASF
surveillance, we have assessed the capacity for the detection and inactivation of
ASFV genome by using Dry-Sponges (3 M) pre-hydrated with a new surfactant liquid.
We sampled different surfaces in ASFV-contaminated facilities, including animal
skins, and the results were compared to those obtained using a traditional
sampling method. The surfactant liquid successfully inactivated the virus, while 
ASFV DNA was well preserved for the detection. This is an effective method to
systematically recover ASFV DNA from different surfaces and skin, which has a key
applied relevance in surveillance of vehicles transporting live animals and
greatly improves animal welfare. This method provides an important basis for the 
detection of ASFV genome that can be assessed without the biosafety requirements 
of a BSL-3 laboratory at least in ASF-affected countries, which may substantially
speed up the early detection of the pathogen.
