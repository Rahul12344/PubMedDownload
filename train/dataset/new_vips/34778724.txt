The outbreak of COVID-19 by the end of 2019 has posed serious health threats to
humanity and jeopardized the global economy. However, no effective drugs are
available to treat COVID-19 currently and there is a great demand to fight
against it. Here, we combined computational screening and an efficient cellular
pseudotyped virus system, confirming that clinical HDAC inhibitors can
efficiently prevent SARS-CoV-2 and potentially be used to fight against COVID-19.
