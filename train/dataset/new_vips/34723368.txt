The decision by the Trump administration to leave many of the policy decisions
regarding COVID-19 to United States governors has had significant consequences
for the management of the pandemic. During the COVID-19 response, the federalist 
approach has created complications in areas including resource acquisition,
crisis communication, testing, and social distancing. Such issues have been
magnified the differences between centralized and decentralized state public
health systems. Governors have found themselves at odds with the Trump
administration in regard to competing for vital equipment, signaling to the
public the severity of the virus, and defining an adequate testing system. Many
governors took bold action and acted in bipartisan cooperation with the governors
of other states, often in the face of strong criticism and protests. The lessons 
learned from COVID-19 regarding the need for coordination at the national level
must be documented for history. Rather than relying on state-by-state
after-action reports, which separately could be become fodder for ideological
debate, this commentary recommends a bipartisan, joint after-action report signed
by state governors as a mechanism to preserve state experiences.
