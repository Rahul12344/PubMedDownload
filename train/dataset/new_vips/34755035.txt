At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were 
many unknowns: transmission vectors of the virus, appropriate intervention
strategies and if being immunocompromised due to inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), for example, or medications put a person at increased risk for severe
COVID-19. Imposing and relaxing of public health restrictions at different times 
and in different regions in Canada led to different epidemiologies of the virus
in different provinces and territories. In order to understand the waxing and
waning of waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to understand the
effective reproductive number (R t ) and the countervailing forces that exert
upward or downward pressure on the spread of the virus at a given point in time. 
As many regions in Canada deal with a third wave, the primary forces affecting
the R t of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are variants of
concern and the increasing vaccinations of Canadians leading to increased
population-level immunity. Fortunately, for the IBD population, current research 
suggests that those with IBD are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19,
nor of having a more severe disease course when compared to the general
population.
