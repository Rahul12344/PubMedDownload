The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus raises alarming
concern around the healthcare facilities due to the significant increase in
patient inflow. Negative-pressurized isolation rooms have been utilized in
various health care facilities to isolate the patients from active community
contact. Several studies have highlighted isolation rooms improvement. However,
limited knowledge is available regarding the isolation room facilities for
pediatric intensive care units (PICU) to accommodate more than one pediatric
patient. In this aspect, this study investigates a negative-pressurized isolation
facility in PICU with minimal design modifications with the possibility that it
can accommodate more than one pediatric patient. The field measurement tests were
conducted to ensure the design compliance of Taiwan CDC. Then, computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) was further utilized to numerically evaluate the HVAC system
role and the ventilation performance towards infection control. A protected
air-jet curtain system with a new ventilation layout was proposed through this
study to enhance the protection for both pediatric patients and medical staff.
The concentration decay was monitored and recorded within 900 s to evaluate the
performance. The concentration can be reduced to 504 ppm for case 1, 620 ppm for 
case 2, 501 ppm for case 3, and 486 ppm for case 4. In addition, the injected
bioaerosol particles could be well diluted dealing with two patients presents a
good performance. The results revealed that this proposed configuration could
feasibly accommodate two patients with a significant contamination control to
protect the medical staff and patients.
