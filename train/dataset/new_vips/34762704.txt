INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections in the Belgian community is mainly estimated based on
test results of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-like symptoms. The
aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity ratio and
distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened
prior hospitalization or surgery, stratified by age category.
MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively studied data on SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR
detection in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients screened
pre-hospitalization or pre-surgery in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders 
over a 12-month period (1 April 2020-31 March 2021).
RESULTS: In total, 255925 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and 2421 positive
results for which a viral load was reported, were included in this study. An
unweighted overall SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR positivity ratio of 1.27% was
observed with strong spatiotemporal differences. SARS-CoV-2 circulated
predominantly in 80+ year old individuals across all time periods except between 
the first and second COVID-19 wave and in 20-30 year old individuals before the
second COVID-19 wave. In contrast to the first wave, a significantly higher
positivity ratio was observed for the 20-40 age group in addition to the 80+ age 
group compared to the other age groups during the second wave. The median viral
load follows a similar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase
ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80+ year old
individuals.
CONCLUSION: There was a high SARS-CoV-2 circulation among asymptomatic patients
with a predominance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly. Moreover,
ahead of the second COVID-19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with
the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20-30 year old individuals,
indicating they could have been the hidden drivers of this wave.
