Fast and accurate identification of microbial pathogens is critical for the
proper treatment of infections. Traditional culture-based diagnosis in clinics is
increasingly supplemented by metagenomic next-generation-sequencing (mNGS). Here,
RNA/cDNA-targeted sequencing (meta-transcriptomics using NGS (mtNGS)) is
established to reduce the host nucleotide percentage in clinic samples and by
combining with Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) platforms (meta-transcriptomics
using third-generation sequencing, mtTGS) to improve the sequencing time. It
shows that mtNGS improves the ratio of microbial reads, facilitates bacterial
identification using multiple-strategies, and discovers fungi, viruses, and
antibiotic resistance genes, and displaying agreement with clinical findings.
Furthermore, longer reads in mtTGS lead to additional improvement in pathogen
identification and also accelerate the clinical diagnosis. Additionally, primary 
tests utilizing direct-RNA sequencing and targeted sequencing of ONT show that
ONT displays important potential but must be further developed. This study
presents the potential of RNA-targeted pathogen identification in clinical
samples, especially when combined with the newest developments in ONT.
