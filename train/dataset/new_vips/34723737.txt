Unexpected COVID-19 Opportunity: Applied Experience for the Nurse Educator
Student.

Polancich S, Steadman L, Moneyham L, Poe T.

BACKGROUND: Lack of experiential learning in nurse educator (NE) programs may
result in students completing didactic coursework with limited or no
opportunities to supervise nursing students in a clinical environment. During the
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, one organization transformed an educational
challenge into an opportunity for NE students.
METHOD: Programmatic evaluation, using a 10-item Likert scale evaluation tool,
was used to obtain feedback from 15 NE students regarding their perceived value
of an experiential learning activity.
RESULTS: Aggregate mean evaluation scores ranged from 2.7 to 4.3. An aggregate
mean of 4.3 was attributed by the NE students to the possibility of spending
additional clinical hours providing oversight to nursing students participating
in this process.
CONCLUSION: Applied experiential learning may enhance the quality of NE students'
educational experience, provide needed opportunity for developing critical
expertise as a NE, and create a window of opportunity for future application of
NE students' experiential learning. [J Nurs Educ. 2021;60(11):642-645.].
