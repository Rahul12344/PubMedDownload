Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein modification play important roles in
modulating the functions of viral proteins in many viruses. Here we demonstrate
that hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is modified by ISG15, which is a
type I IFN-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein; this modification is called
ISGylation. Immunoblot analyses revealed that HBx proteins derived from four
different HBV genotypes accepted ISGylation in cultured cells. Site-directed
mutagenesis revealed that three lysine residues (K91, K95 and K140) on the HBx
protein, which are well conserved among all the HBV genotypes, are involved in
acceptance of ISGylation. Using expression plasmids encoding three known E3
ligases involved in the ISGylation to different substrates, we found that HERC5
functions as an E3 ligase for HBx-ISGylation. Treatment with type I and type III 
IFNs resulted in the limited suppression of HBV replication in Hep38.7-Tet cells.
When cells were treated with IFN-α, silencing of ISG15 resulted in a marked
reduction of HBV replication in Hep38.7-Tet cells, suggesting a role of ISG15 in 
the resistance to IFN-α. In contrast, the silencing of USP18 (an ISG15
de-conjugating enzyme) increased the HBV replication in Hep38.7-Tet cells. Taken 
together, these results suggest that the HERC5-mediated ISGylation of HBx protein
confers pro-viral functions on HBV replication and participates in the resistance
to IFN-α-mediated antiviral activity.
