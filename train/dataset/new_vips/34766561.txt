ABSTRACT: Our objective was to analyze in vitro the persistence of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the packaging material of the 
drugs dispensed to hospital wards. Additionally, to evaluate if the protection
with a double plastic bag prevents the contamination of the medication dispensed 
to an intensive care unit (ICU).On the first part, different materials containing
different drugs within an ICU were sampled to confirm the lack of contamination
by SARS-CoV-2. The confirmation of the virus was performed using real time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. As a control group, in the
microbiology laboratory we inoculated the virus into the different surfaces
containing the same drugs included in the first part. Samples were obtained with 
a sterile swab at 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 21, and 30 days after inoculation and analyzed
through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.None of the
studied materials containing the drugs within an ICU was contaminated by
SARS-CoV-2. In the second part, SARS-CoV-2 was found in all surfaces for up to
30 days.The use of double-bag unit-dose system to deliver medication in a
pandemic seems effective to prevent the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A
striking SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability of up to 30 days was found in the surfaces
containing the drugs.
