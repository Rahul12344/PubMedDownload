BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a big challenge in
the field of oncology. The liver disease (viral or not viral) underlying HCC
turned out to be crucial in determining the biologic behavior of the tumor,
including its response to treatment. The aim of this analysis was to investigate 
the role of the etiology of the underlying liver disease in survival outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on a large
cohort of patients treated with lenvatinib as first-line therapy for advanced HCC
from both Eastern and Western institutions. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: Among the 1232 lenvatinib-treated HCC patients, 453 (36.8%) were
hepatitis C virus positive, 268 hepatitis B virus positive (21.8%), 236
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) correlate (19.2%) and 275 had other
etiologies (22.3%). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 6.2 months
[95% confidence interval (CI) 5.9-6.7 months] and the median overall survival
(mOS) was 15.8 months (95% CI 14.9-17.2 months). In the univariate analysis for
OS NASH-HCC was associated with longer mOS [22.2 versus 15.1 months; hazard ratio
(HR) 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.85; P = 0.0006]. In the univariate analysis for PFS
NASH-HCC was associated with longer mPFS (7.5 versus 6.5 months; HR 0.84; 95% CI 
0.71-0.99; P = 0.0436). The multivariate analysis confirmed NASH-HCC (HR 0.64;
95% CI 0.48-0.86; P = 0.0028) as an independent prognostic factor for OS, along
with albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, extrahepatic spread,
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, portal vein thrombosis, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and alpha-fetoprotein. An interaction
test was performed between sorafenib and lenvatinib cohorts and the results
highlighted the positive predictive role of NASH in favor of the lenvatinib arm
(P = 0.0047).
CONCLUSION: NASH has been identified as an independent prognostic factor in a
large cohort of patients with advanced HCC treated with lenvatinib, thereby
suggesting the role of the etiology in the selection of patients for tyrosine
kinase treatment. If validated, this result could provide new insights useful to 
improve the management of these patients.
