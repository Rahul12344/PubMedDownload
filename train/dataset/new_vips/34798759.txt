The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
wastewater produced interest in its use for sentinel surveillance at a community 
level and as a complementary approach to syndromic surveillance. With this work, 
we set the foundations for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in Portugal by
monitoring the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA circulation in the community, on a
nationwide perspective during different epidemiological phases of the pandemic.
The Charité assays (E_Sarbecco, RdRP, and N_Sarbecco) were applied to monitor,
over 32-weeks (April to December 2020), the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the
inlet of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which together serve more than 
two million people in Portugal. Raw wastewater from three Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) reference hospitals was also analyzed during this period. In
total, more than 600 samples were tested. For the first weeks, detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sporadic, with concentrations varying from 103 to 105 genome
copies per liter (GC/L). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increased steeply by the
end of May into late June, mainly in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (LVT), during
the reopening phase. After the summer, with the reopening of schools in
mid-September and return to partial face-to-face work, a pronounced increase of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was detected. In the LVT area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load
agreed with reported trends in hotspots of infection. Synchrony between trends of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases highlights the
value of WBE as a surveillance tool, particularly after the phasing out of the
epidemiological curve and when hotspots of disease re-emerge in the population
which might be difficult to spot based solely on syndromic surveillance and
contact tracing. This is the first study crossing several epidemiological stages 
highlighting the long-term use of WBE for SARS-CoV-2.
