After witnessing extraordinary scientific and regulatory efforts to speed
development of and access to new COVID-19 interventions, patients facing other
serious diseases have begun to ask "where's our Operation Warp Speed?" and "why
isn't Emergency Use Authorization an option for our health crises?" Although this
pandemic bears a number of unique features, the response to COVID-19 offers
translatable lessons, in both its successes and failures, for non-pandemic
diseases. These include the importance of collaborating across sectors,
supporting the highest-priority research efforts, adopting rigorous and
innovative trial designs, and sharing reliable information quickly. In addition, 
the regulatory response to the pandemic demonstrates that lowering standards for 
marketing authorization can result in increased safety concerns, missed
opportunities for research and treatment, and delays in determining what works.
Accordingly, policymakers and patient advocates seeking to build on the COVID-19 
experience for non-pandemic diseases with unmet treatment needs should focus
their efforts on promoting robust and efficient research designs, improving
access to clinical trials, and facilitating use of the Food and Drug
Administration's existing Expanded Access pathway.
