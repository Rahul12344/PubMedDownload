Background: The CDC and WHO recommend alcohol-based hand sanitizers to inactivate
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2].
Aim: Benzalkonium chloride [BAK] is another hand sanitizer active ingredient that
could be used in response to the global pandemic. Deployment of BAK-based hand
sanitizers could reduce shortages of alcohol products and increase hand hygiene
options where there are social, physical, and toxicological constraints on
alcohol use.
Methods: Two commercially available BAK-based hand sanitizers, a concentrate
diluted on-site with water and a ready-to-use product, were tested for activity
against SARS-CoV-2 in the European Norm Virucidal Activity Suspension Test
[EN14476]. A WHO and CDC-recommended 80% alcohol-based hand sanitizer formulation
was tested in parallel.
Findings: Both BAK formulations demonstrated a ≥4.0 log10 reduction of SARS-CoV-2
in 30 seconds, meeting the EN14476 performance standard for virucidal activity
against SARS-CoV-2 and matching the in vitro effectiveness of the ethanol-based
sanitizer.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that a commercial BAK hand hygiene
formulation may be another effective means of inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus
and could be considered as option for pandemic response.
