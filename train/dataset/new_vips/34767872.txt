Person-to-person transmission of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
virus (SFTSV) is a new threat to human health. Here we report an outbreak of
nosocomial person-to-person transmission of SFTS. Among eight persons with
face-to-face contact distance ≤50 centimeters and/or exposure time ≥30 minutes to
the index patient, six became were infected. Only one of the 17 persons with
exposure distance ≥ 50 centimeters and exposure time ≤ 30 minutes was infected
(75% vs. 6.25%, p <0.001). Epidemiological investigation revealed high viral
load, bloody secretions and bleeding, exposure time and distance as the key
factors in person-to-person transmission.
