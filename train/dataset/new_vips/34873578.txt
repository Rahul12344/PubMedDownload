Omicron (B.1.1.529): Infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance.

Chen J, Wang R, Gilby NB, Wei GW.

The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant
Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its
contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody
resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the spike
(S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete experimental
evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we present a
comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity,
vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI)
model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points 
and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that
Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about
twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D)
structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more
likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be 
seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from
Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb
cocktail appears to be mild.
