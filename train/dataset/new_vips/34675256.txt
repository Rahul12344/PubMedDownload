In a survey and three experiments (one preregistered with a nationally
representative sample), we examined if vaccination requirements are likely to
backfire, as commonly feared. We investigated if relative to encouraging free
choice in vaccination, requiring a vaccine weakens or strengthens vaccination
intentions, both in general and among individuals with a predisposition to
experience psychological reactance. In the four studies, compared to free choice,
requirements strengthened vaccination intentions across racial and ethnic groups,
across studies, and across levels of trait psychological reactance. The results
consistently suggest that fears of a backlash against vaccine mandates may be
unfounded and that requirements will promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the
United States.
