INTRODUCTION: Proctologic issues entail a frequent reason for consultation in the
emergency department (ED). We aim to analyze how the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has
impacted in the demand for proctological consultations.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive comparative retrospective study of
cross-sectional cohorts of patients attending the ED for proctological complaints
from March to April in 2020 and 2019. Demographic variables, comorbidities,
reasons for consultation and diagnosis, treatment and readmission were included. 
Four periods were analyzed according to the different stages of the pandemic
derived limitations.
RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were reviewed, 58 in 2020 and 133 in 2019 with
an average age of 48 years (SD 20.1) and 112 (58.6%) males. The average number of
daily consultations was 2.18 patients in 2019 versus 0.95 in 2020 (p=0.025)
meaning a 56% reduction in consultations for proctological reasons. This
difference in average consultations was significant in both periods of lockout
(p=0.001) and previous de-escalation (p=0.014). The diagnosis distribution was
similar between both periods; however, perianal abscesses doubled their rate in
2020, 22.4% versus 11.3% (p=0.045). There was an increasing need for surgery, 31%
vs 15% (p=0.011) with no difference in outpatients regimen after emergency
surgery (12.5% vs 7.5%, p=0.201). Three patients in 2020 required readmission to 
the ED (5.2% vs 12.9%, p=0.086).
CONCLUSION: There was a decrease of a 56% in proctologic emergency consultation, 
however, the need for surgery was twice more frequent during the study period.
Reflection on the use of emergencies for proctological reasons is warranted.
