The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 led the 
Spanish government to impose a national lockdown in an attempt to control the
spread of the infection. Mobility restrictions and the requirement of a medical
prescription for serological testing for COVID-19 were included among the control
measures. Under this scenario, between April 15th and June 15th, 2020, we
performed an observational study including 449 individuals allowed to be tested
according to the governmental restrictions, i.e. fulfilling the following
prescription requirements: manifestation of COVID-19-compatible symptoms, contact
with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, or employment as an essential worker,
including health care workers, firefighters and public safety personnel such as
police. Importantly, a relevant feature of the studied cohort was that none of
the participants had been hospitalized. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity
in this specific cohort, uncovering intrinsic features of great demographic
interest. The overall rate of IgG seropositivity was 33.69% (95% CI:
29.27-38.21). This frequency was comparable among the different participant
occupations. A RT-PCR positive test, contact with a household member previously
tested positive and the presence of COVID-19-compatible symptoms were positively 
associated with IgG + results. Among these symptoms, ageusia/anosmia was
positively and independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, while
odynophagia was inversely associated. However, fever, ageusia/anosmia and
asthenia were the most frequent symptoms described by IgG + subjects. Therefore, 
our data illustrate how specific cohorts display particular characteristics that 
should be taken into account when studying population-wide SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence and key defining symptoms of COVID-19.
