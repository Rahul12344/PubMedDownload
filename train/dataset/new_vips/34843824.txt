Outbreaks of duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) have caused serious economic losses in
China since 2010. In this study, an infectious clone of the DTMUV BZ-2010strain, 
isolated from layer cherry duck in China, was constructed using the
bacterium-free infectious subgenomic-amplicons method. The subgenomic-amplicons
of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) at the 5' terminus of the first DNA 
fragment, the entire genome of DTMUV, and the hepatitis delta ribozyme followed
by the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (HDR/SV40pA) at the 3' terminus of 
the last DNA fragment were synthesized and amplified by PCR in three DNA
fragments. The pCMV and HDR/SV40pA were used to drive the viral RNA transcription
and generate a full-length RNA transcript of the virus, and were found to be
effective in reassembling DTMUV in duck embryo fibroblast cells. The RNA
transcripts from the infection clone were infectious in duck embryo fibroblast
cells, generating the reconstituted DTMUV. This study provided a valuable reverse
genetic tool for the further study DTMUV pathogenesis.
