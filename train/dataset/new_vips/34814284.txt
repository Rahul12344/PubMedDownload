The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is being felt in all spheres of our
lives - cutting across the boundaries of nation, wealth, religions or race. From 
the time of the first detection of infection among the public, the virus spread
though almost all the countries in the world in a short period of time. With
humans as the carrier of the virus, the spreading process necessarily depends on 
the their mobility after being infected. Not only in the primary spreading
process, but also in the subsequent spreading of the mutant variants, human
mobility plays a central role in the dynamics. Therefore, on one hand travel
restrictions of varying degree were imposed and are still being imposed, by
various countries both nationally and internationally. On the other hand, these
restrictions have severe fall outs in businesses and livelihood in general.
Therefore, it is an optimization process, exercised on a global scale, with
multiple changing variables. Here we review the techniques and their effects on
optimization or proposed optimizations of human mobility in different scales,
carried out by data driven, machine learning and model approaches.
