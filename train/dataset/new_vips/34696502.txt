Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) can infect the central nervous
system (CNS) with dire consequences; in children and adults, HSV-1 may cause
focal encephalitis, while HSV-2 causes meningitis. In neonates, both viruses can 
cause severe, disseminated CNS infections with high mortality rates. Here, we
differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) towards cortical
neurons for infection with clinical CNS strains of HSV-1 or HSV-2. Progenies from
both viruses were produced at equal quantities in iPSCs, neuroprogenitors and
cortical neurons. HSV-1 and HSV-2 decreased viability of neuroprogenitors by
36.0% and 57.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively, 48 h post-infection, while cortical
neurons were resilient to infection by both viruses. However, in these functional
neurons, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 decreased gene expression of two markers of
synaptic activity, CAMK2B and ARC, and affected synaptic activity negatively in
multielectrode array experiments. However, unaltered secretion levels of the
neurodegeneration markers tau and NfL suggested intact axonal integrity. Viral
replication of both viruses was found after six days, coinciding with 6-fold and 
22-fold increase in gene expression of cellular RNA polymerase II by HSV-1 and
HSV-2, respectively. Our results suggest a resilience of human cortical neurons
relative to the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2.
