While extensive studies of virus capsid assembly in environments mimicking in
vivo conditions have led to an understanding of the thermodynamic driving forces 
at work, applying this knowledge to virus assembly in other solvents than aqueous
buffers has not been attempted yet. In this study, Brome mosaic virus (BMV)
capsid proteins were shown to preserve their self-assembly abilities in an
aprotic polar solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This facilitated protein cage
encapsulation of nanoparticles and dye molecules that favor organic solvents,
such as Î²-NaYF4-based upconversion nanoparticles and BODIPY dye. Assembly was
found to be robust relative to a surprisingly broad range of DMSO concentrations.
Cargos with poor initial stability in aqueous solutions were readily encapsulated
at high DMSO concentrations and then transferred to aqueous solvents, where they 
remained stable and preserved their function for months.
