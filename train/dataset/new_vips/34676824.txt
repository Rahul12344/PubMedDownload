Pestiviruses like bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and classical swine fever
virus (CSFV) belong to the family Flaviviridae. A special feature of the
Flaviviridae is the importance of nonstructural (NS) proteins for both genome
replication and virion morphogenesis. The NS2-3-4A region and its regulated
processing by the NS2 autoprotease and the NS3/4A protease plays a central role
in the pestiviral life cycle. We report the identification and characterization
of a novel internal cleavage in BVDV NS2, which is mediated by the NS3/4A
protease. Further mapping using the NS2 of BVDV-1 strain NCP7 showed that
cleavage occurs between L188 and G189. This cleavage site represents a novel
sequence motif recognized by the NS3/4A protease and is conserved between the
pestivirus species A, B and D. Inhibition of this internal NS2 cleavage by
mutating the cleavage site did not cause obvious effects on RNA replication or
virion morphogenesis in cultured cell lines. Accordingly, this novel internal NS2
cleavage adds an additional layer to the already complex polyprotein processing
of Pestiviruses and might further extend the repertoires of the multifunctional
NS2. However, unravelling of the functional relevance of this novel processing
event in NS2, therefore, awaits future in vivo studies.
