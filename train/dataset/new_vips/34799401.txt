The interplay between environmental and genetic factors plays a key role in the
development of many autoimmune diseases. In particular, the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) is an established contributor to multiple sclerosis, lupus, and other
disorders. Previously, we showed that the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)
transactivating protein occupies up to half of the risk loci for a set of seven
autoimmune disorders. To further examine the mechanistic roles played by EBNA2 at
these loci on a genome-wide scale, we globally examined gene expression,
chromatin accessibility, chromatin looping, and EBNA2 binding in a B cell line
that was (1) uninfected, (2) infected with a strain of EBV lacking EBNA2, or (3) 
infected with a strain that expresses EBNA2. We identified more than 400
EBNA2-dependent differentially expressed human genes and more than 5000 EBNA2
binding events in the human genome. ATAC-seq analysis revealed more than 2000
regions in the human genome with EBNA2-dependent chromatin accessibility, and
HiChIP data revealed more than 1700 regions where EBNA2 altered chromatin looping
interactions. Autoimmune genetic risk loci were highly enriched at the sites of
these EBNA2-dependent chromatin-altering events. We present examples of
autoimmune risk genotype-dependent EBNA2 events, nominating genetic risk
mechanisms for autoimmune risk loci such as ZMIZ1 Taken together, our results
reveal important interactions between host genetic variation and EBNA2-driven
disease mechanisms. Further, our study highlights a critical role for EBNA2 in
rewiring human gene regulatory programs through rearrangement of the chromatin
landscape and nominates these interactions as components of genetic mechanisms
that influence the risk of multiple autoimmune diseases.
