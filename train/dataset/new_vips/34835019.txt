The detailed characterization of human γδ T lymphocyte differentiation at the
single-cell transcriptomic (scRNAseq) level in tumors and patients with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires both a reference differentiation
trajectory of γδ T cells and a robust mapping method for additional γδ T
lymphocytes. Here, we incepted such a method to characterize thousands of γδ T
lymphocytes from (n = 95) patients with cancer or adult and pediatric COVID-19
disease. We found that cancer patients with human papillomavirus-positive head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma and Epstein-Barr virus-positive Hodgkin's
lymphoma have γδ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes that are more prone to
recirculate from the tumor and avoid exhaustion. In COVID-19, both TCRVγ9 and
TCRVγnon9 subsets of γδ T lymphocytes relocalize from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the infected lung tissue, where their advanced
differentiation, tissue residency, and exhaustion reflect T cell activation.
Although severe COVID-19 disease increases both recruitment and exhaustion of γδ 
T lymphocytes in infected lung lesions but not blood, the anti-IL6R therapy with 
Tocilizumab promotes γδ T lymphocyte differentiation in patients with COVID-19.
PBMC from pediatric patients with acute COVID-19 disease display similar γδ T
cell lymphopenia to that seen in adult patients. However, blood γδ T cells from
children with the COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome are not
lymphodepleted, but they are differentiated as in healthy PBMC. These findings
suggest that some virus-induced memory γδ T lymphocytes durably persist in the
blood of adults and could subsequently infiltrate and recirculate in tumors.
