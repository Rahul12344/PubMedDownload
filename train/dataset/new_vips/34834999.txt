We introduce Viral Phrenology, a new scheme for understanding the genomic
composition of spherical viruses based on the locations of their structural
protrusions. We used icosahedral point arrays to classify 135 distinct viral
capsids collected from over 600 capsids available in the VIPERdb. Using gauge
points of point arrays, we found 149 unique structural protrusions. We then show 
how to use the locations of these protrusions to determine the genetic
composition of the virus. We then show that ssDNA, dsDNA, dsRNA and ssRNA viruses
use different arrangements for distributing their protrusions. We also found that
Triangulation number is also partially dependent on the structural protrusions.
This analysis begins to tie together Baltimore Classification and Triangulation
number using point arrays.
