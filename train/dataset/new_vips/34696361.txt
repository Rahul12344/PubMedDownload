To further classify the oomycete viruses that have been discovered in recent
years, we investigated virus infection in the plant-parasitic oomycete
Globisporangium ultimum in Japan. Double-stranded RNA detection, high-throughput 
sequencing, and RT-PCR revealed that the G. ultimum isolate UOP226 contained two 
viruses related to fusarivirus and totivirus, named Pythium ultimum RNA virus 1
(PuRV1) and Pythium ultimum RNA virus 2 (PuRV2), respectively. Phylogenetic
analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) showed that fusari-like PuRV1 belonged to a different phylogenetic group
than Plasmopara viticola lesion-associated fusari virus (PvlaFV) 1-3 from
oomycete Plasmopara viticola. Codon usage bias of the PuRV1 RdRp gene was more
similar to those of fungi than Globisporangium and Phytophthora, suggesting that 
the PuRV1 ancestor horizontally transmitted to G. ultimum ancestor from fungi.
Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the RdRp of toti-like
PuRV2 showed a monophyletic group with the other toti-like oomycete viruses from 
Globisporangium, Phytophthora, and Pl. viticola. However, the nucleotide
sequences of toti-like oomycete viruses were not so homologous, suggesting the
possibility of convergent evolution of toti-like oomycete viruses.
