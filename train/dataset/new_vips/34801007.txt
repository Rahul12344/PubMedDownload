BACKGROUND: A new corona virus called COVID-19 and its epidemic has affected
health care systems in many ways. There have also been significant changes in
dental education. The present study summarizes the findings about dental
education resulting from a scoping review of COVID-19 and dentistry.
METHODS: First, a comprehensive search of five databases (Google Scholar, Medline
through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central) was conducted with the
keywords: COVID-19 and its equivalent terms, dentistry, education, oral,
students, curriculum, and academics. Articles related to oral health and COVID-19
were searched. Then articles on the subject of dental education were screened and
reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 1389 articles investigating COVID-19 and dentistry, 135 articles 
were related to dental education and its relationship with COVID-19. The most
articles in this field were from the United States, India, and Saudi Arabia. Most
of the articles were cross-sectional and then review articles. Based on the
review the articles were divided into two main categories of changes and
concerns, and opportunities and solutions. Moreover, the following themes were
extracted: teaching-learning quality and methods, study career and how students
are prepared, infection control policies, theses, exams and assessments,
financial and economic security, students and staff's mental health, school's
policies and curricula, knowledge of students and staff about COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Dental education now faces big challenges, some of which have never 
been experienced before. On the other hand, the epidemic has created
opportunities for dental education as well. Most of these challenges and
opportunities are the same around the world, and the findings of the present
study can be a good help to overcome the challenges ahead as well as a good
reference to find the right questions to be answered in future studies.
