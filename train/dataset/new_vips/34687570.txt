BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of long-term data on steroid-free
immunosuppression using alemtuzumab in pediatric kidney transplantation (KTx).
This study examines long-term outcomes with alemtuzumab without steroid
maintenance therapy in pediatric KTx.
METHODS: From July 2005 to June 2015, 71 pediatric KTx recipients received
alemtuzumab without steroid maintenance. They were followed from 4.1 to
14.1 years post KTx.
RESULTS: Patient survival: One child expired with a functioning graft from
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Patient survival was 98.6%. 
Graft survival: Eighteen grafts were lost (16 from chronic rejection). Graft
survival at 5 and 10 years was 92.3% and 61.3%, respectively. Rejection:
Twenty-three (32.4%) patients were free from T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), 16
(22.5%) had >3 episodes. Sixteen (22.5%) were treated for antibody-mediated
rejection (AMR). Infection: Twenty-three children developed Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), 5 developed cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 20 developed BK virus infection.
Four (5.6%) developed PTLD. Twenty-two (31.0%) required treatment for
neutropenia. Growth parameters: Mean height and weight increased by 0.56 and 0.69
SDS (standard deviation score), respectively. Body mass index increased by
5.1 kg/m2 at 10 years. Less than 40% required antihypertensive medications at
all-time points.
CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab, without corticosteroid maintenance, offers 98.6% patient
survival at 14 years with five and 10-year graft survival of 92.3% and 61.3%,
respectively. TCMR and AMR requiring treatment were 67.4% and 22.5%,
respectively. CMV, EBV, and BK viremia rates were 7.0%, 32.4%, and 28.2%,
respectively. Thirty-one percent were treated for neutropenia; 5.6% developed
PTLD. There were improvements in growth parameters and blood pressure.
