Polarization-dependent plasmonic nano-tweezer as a platform for on-chip trapping 
and manipulation of virus-like particles.

Plasmonics advanced materials with the capability of environmental variation
detection extend the application of visible light, satisfying the demands of less
footprint, easy-to-use, and high tunability for visible-sensitive materials. In
this area, localized surface plasmon can significantly enhance the electric field
smaller than the radiation wavelength providing a strong gradient force required 
in optical tweezing systems. Owing to this beneficial advantage over the
conventional optical tweezers, the plasmonic tweezers have matured to a stage
where today become increasingly attractive for trapping and manipulation of
nanoparticles. In this work, we are proposing a tunable plasmonic nano-tweezer
that operates according to the polarization of excitation laser light. The
proposed novel structure encompasses a gold nano-ring and a gold nano-disk in
which by changing the beam polarization, the hot spots position also changes, and
the nanoparticles can be relocated around the circumference of a circle trapped
at a certain point. According to 3D finite-difference-time-domain simulations,
the proposed nano-tweezing system can potentially exert a trapping force of 164
pNW-1 on a 20 nm HIV-1 virus-like particle.
