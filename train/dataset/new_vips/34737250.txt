PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop an untact visit service based on an
application that can be utilized in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
during COVID-19.
METHODS: This study adopted the double diamond process of service design
comprising the discovery, defining, and development stages.
RESULTS: We developed an untact visit service based on an application that
considered the child's status, schedule, photo, and video messages, and so on.
Moreover, we derived a service flow regarding the required roles and the type of 
flow shown between each stakeholder.
CONCLUSION: Considering the ongoing pandemic, the untact visit service is
designed to increase rapport and participation of parents, share the child's
information in real-time, and provide one-stop service without increasing
healthcare providers' work. It will be a useful visit service that can be applied
and evaluated in various hospital settings and the PICU.
