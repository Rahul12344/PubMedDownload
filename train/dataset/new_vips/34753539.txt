OBJECTIVES: To investigate vitamin D nutritional status in children after
outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effect of strict 
epidemic prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 epidemic on vitamin D
nutritional status in children.
METHODS: A total of 7 460 children who underwent routine physical examinations
from February to August, 2020 and had normal results were retrospectively
enrolled as the observation group, and 10 102 children who underwent routine
physical examinations from February to August, 2019 (no epidemic of COVID-19) and
had normal results were enrolled as the control group. The serum level of
25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] was compared between the two groups. The children 
in the observation and control groups who underwent physical examinations in
March and April were selected as the epidemic prevention subgroup (n=1 710) and
non-epidemic subgroup (n=2 877) respectively. The subjects were divided into five
age groups (infancy, early childhood, preschool, school age and adolescence), and
serum 25(OH)D levels of children of all ages were compared between the epidemic
prevention and non-epidemic subgroups.
RESULTS: The observation group had a lower serum level of 25(OH)D than the
control group in March and April (P<0.001). The epidemic prevention subgroup had 
a lower serum level of 25(OH)D than the non-epidemic subgroup in all age groups
(P<0.001). The vitamin D sufficiency rate in early childhood, preschool, school
and adolescent children from the epidemic prevention subgroup was lower than the 
non-epidemic subgroup (P<0.001), with a reduction of 10.71%, 18.76%, 59.63% and
56.29% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Strict prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 epidemic may
lead to a significant reduction in vitamin D level in children, especially
school-aged and adolescent children. It is recommended to timely monitor vitamin 
D level in children, take vitamin D supplements, and increase the time of outdoor
sunshine as far as possible under the premise of adherence to epidemic prevention
regulations.

Publisher: 目的: 调查新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情发生后儿童维生素D营养状况，并探讨实施严格疫情防控措施对儿童维生素D营养状况的影响。方法:
回顾性选取2020年2~8月常规体检合格儿童7 460例作为观察组，同时选取2019年2~8月（无疫情期）10
102例常规体检合格儿童作为对照组，比较两组血清25羟基维生素D［25-hydroxy vitamin
D，25(OH)D］水平。同时将观察组与对照组中3~4月期间的体检儿童分别作为疫情防控亚组（n=1 710）和未防控亚组（n=2
877）。将研究对象分成5个年龄段（婴儿期、幼儿期、学龄前期、学龄期及青春期），比较疫情防控亚组和未防控亚组组间各年龄段儿童血清25(OH)D水平的差异。结果: 
观察组3月和4月的血清25(OH)D水平均明显低于对照组（P<0.001）。疫情防控亚组各年龄段儿童血清25(OH)D水平均明显低于未防控亚组（P<0.001）。
疫情防控亚组幼儿期、学龄前期、学龄期和青春期儿童维生素D充足率显著低于未防控亚组（P<0.001），较未防控亚组分别下降10.71%、18.76%、59.63%和
56.29%。结论: 新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情严格防控措施可能导致儿童，尤其是学龄期和青春期儿童的维生素D水平明显降低，建议及时监测儿童维生素D水平并补充适量维生素D
制剂，在遵守防疫规定的前提下尽量增加户外日照时间。.
