BACKGROUND: Reported COVID-19 cases underestimate true SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Data on all infections, including asymptomatic infections, are needed to guide
programs. To minimize biases in estimates from reported cases and seroprevalence 
surveys, we conducted a household-based probability survey in Georgia and
estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for antibody
waning.
METHODS: From August to December 2020, we mailed specimen collection kits (nasal 
swabs and blood spots) to a random sample of Georgia addresses. One household
adult completed a survey and returned specimens for virus and antibody testing.
We estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for waning
antibodies, reported fraction, and infection fatality ratio (IFR). Differences in
seropositivity among demographic, geographic and clinical subgroups were explored
with weighted prevalence ratios (PR).
RESULTS: Among 1,370 participants, adjusted cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2
was 16.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 13.5-19.2%) as of November 16, 2020. The 
reported fraction was 26.6% and IFR was 0.78%. Non-Hispanic Black (PR: 2.03, CI
1.0, 4.1) and Hispanic adults (PR: 1.98, CI 0.74, 5.31) were more likely than
non-Hispanic White adults to be seropositive.
CONCLUSIONS: As of mid-November 2020, one in 6 adults in Georgia had been
infected with SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 epidemic in Georgia is likely
substantially underestimated by reported cases.
