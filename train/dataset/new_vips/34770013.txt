Many construction accidents occur in China each year, leading to a large number
of deaths, injures, and property losses. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, little 
attention is paid to construction safety, resulting in severe accidents. To
prevent construction accidents and learn to how address safety issues in future
pandemics, this study proposed an improved STAMP (Systems Theoretic Accident
Modeling and Processes) model to analyze the collapse accident of the Xinjia
Express Hotel used for COVID-19 quarantine in China. Through the application of
the STAMP approach, the causes of the construction accident and the relationship 
between various causal factors are analyzed from a systematic perspective. The
identified causes are divided into five categories: contractors, management of
organizations, technical methods, participants, and interactive feedback.
Finally, safety recommendations are drawn from this study to improve construction
safety and safety management in pandemics.
