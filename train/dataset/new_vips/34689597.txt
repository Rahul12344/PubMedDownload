COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, has resulted in a massive global
health crisis. Bioactive molecules extracted or synthesized using starting
material obtained from marine species, including griffithsin, plitidepsin and
fingolimod are in clinical trials to evaluate their anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-HIV 
efficacies. The current review highlights the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of
marine-derived phytochemicals explored using in silico, in vitro and in vivo
models. The current literature suggests that these molecules have the potential
to bind with various key drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, many of these
agents have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory potentials and thus could play
a role in the attenuation of COVID-19 complications. Overall, these agents may
play a role in the management of COVID-19, but further preclinical and clinical
studies are still required to establish their role in the mitigation of the
current viral pandemic.
