Outcomes and costs of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contact tracing are limited.
During March-May 2020, we constructed transmission chains from 184 index cases
and 1,499 contacts in Salt Lake County, Utah, USA, to assess outcomes and
estimate staff time and salaries. We estimated 1,102 staff hours and $29,234
spent investigating index cases and contacts. Among contacts, 374 (25%) had
COVID-19; secondary case detection rate was ≈31% among first-generation contacts,
≈16% among second- and third-generation contacts, and ≈12% among fourth-, fifth-,
and sixth-generation contacts. At initial interview, 51% (187/370) of contacts
were COVID-19-positive; 35% (98/277) became positive during 14-day quarantine.
Median time from symptom onset to investigation was 7 days for index cases and 4 
days for first-generation contacts. Contact tracing reduced the number of cases
between contact generations and time between symptom onset and investigation but 
required substantial resources. Our findings can help jurisdictions allocate
resources for contact tracing.
