Importance: Racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by 
COVID-19.
Objectives: To evaluate whether rates of severe COVID-19, defined as
hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or in-hospital death, are
higher among racial and ethnic minority groups compared with non-Hispanic White
persons.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 99
counties within 14 US states participating in the COVID-19-Associated
Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Participants were persons of all ages
hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021.
Exposures: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization, defined as a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test within 14 days prior to or during hospitalization.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative age-adjusted rates (per 100 000
population) of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death by race and ethnicity.
Rate ratios (RR) were calculated for each racial and ethnic group compared with
White persons.
Results: Among 153 692 patients with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations,
143 342 (93.3%) with information on race and ethnicity were included in the
analysis. Of these, 105 421 (73.5%) were 50 years or older, 72 159 (50.3%) were
male, 28 762 (20.1%) were Hispanic or Latino, 2056 (1.4%) were non-Hispanic
American Indian or Alaska Native, 7737 (5.4%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific 
Islander, 40 806 (28.5%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 63 981 (44.6%) were White. 
Compared with White persons, American Indian or Alaska Native, Latino, Black, and
Asian or Pacific Islander persons were more likely to have higher cumulative
age-adjusted rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death as follows:
American Indian or Alaska Native (hospitalization: RR, 3.70; 95% CI, 3.54-3.87;
ICU admission: RR, 6.49; 95% CI, 6.01-7.01; death: RR, 7.19; 95% CI, 6.47-7.99); 
Latino (hospitalization: RR, 3.06; 95% CI, 3.01-3.10; ICU admission: RR, 4.20;
95% CI, 4.08-4.33; death: RR, 3.85; 95% CI, 3.68-4.01); Black (hospitalization:
RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.81-2.89; ICU admission: RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 3.09-3.26; death:
RR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.48-2.69); and Asian or Pacific Islander (hospitalization: RR,
1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; ICU admission: RR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.83-1.98; death: RR,
1.64; 95% CI, 1.55-1.74).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional analysis, American Indian or
Alaska Native, Latino, Black, and Asian or Pacific Islander persons were more
likely than White persons to have a COVID-19-associated hospitalization, ICU
admission, or in-hospital death during the first year of the US COVID-19
pandemic. Equitable access to COVID-19 preventive measures, including
vaccination, is needed to minimize the gap in racial and ethnic disparities of
severe COVID-19.
