Dysregulated inflammation dominated by chemokine expression is a key feature of
disease following infection with the globally important human pathogens Zika
virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus, but a mechanistic understanding of how
pro-inflammatory responses are initiated is lacking. Mitophagy is a
quality-control mechanism that regulates innate immune signaling and cytokine
production through selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. Here, we
demonstrate that ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) antagonizes mitophagy by
binding to the host protein Ajuba and preventing its translocation to depolarized
mitochondria where it is required for PINK1 activation and downstream signaling. 
Consequent mitophagy suppression amplifies the production of pro-inflammatory
chemokines through protein kinase R (PKR) sensing of mitochondrial RNA. In
Ajuba-/- mice, ZIKV induces early expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines
associated with significantly enhanced dissemination to tissues. This work
identifies Ajuba as a critical regulator of mitophagy and demonstrates a role for
mitophagy in limiting systemic inflammation following infection by globally
important human viruses.
