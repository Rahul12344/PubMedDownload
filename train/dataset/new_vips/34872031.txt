Humans evolved numerous cell-intrinsic restriction factors as a first line of
defense against viral pathogens. Typically, they inhibit efficient viral
replication and thus prevent viral zoonoses and pandemics. However, viruses show 
enormous adaptability and are well known for their ability to counteract
antiviral mechanisms. Accumulating evidence shows that some viruses are even
capable of exploiting antiviral factors for efficient infection. In addition,
antiviral factors may exert enhancing effects under specific circumstances. While
much progress has been made in understanding the antiviral mechanisms of
restriction factors, their proviral effects are poorly defined. Here, we
summarize current knowledge on how viral pathogens may exploit otherwise
antiviral cellular factors for efficient infection and replication.
