BACKGROUND: The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Argentina on 3 March
2020. Measures to limit the spread of the virus were implemented, including
complete lockdown (26 March). Nonetheless, the virus spread throughout the
country, with a first peak of almost a million cases in October. On 30 November, 
the government's recommendation switched from social, preventive and compulsory
isolation, to social, preventive and compulsory distancing.
OBJECTIVES: To describe a tailored public health strategy to mitigate the spread 
of SARS-CoV-2 and determine its behaviour in San Antonio de Areco district from
Buenos Aires province (Argentina) through a private-public association.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Surveillance of the virus was performed with
the local healthcare system, through early identification of cases and the
systematic study of each infected individual and contact, regardless of
symptomatology, using telemedicine and a COVID-19-specific outpatient clinic.
Real-time PCR was used for detection using both individual and pooled samples,
with a 12-hour turnaround time.
RESULTS: Up to 30 November, a total of 2426 suspected cases were analysed and 578
were confirmed. Surveillance of health personnel and at-risk populations proved
effective, mitigating viral spread. Pooling samples allowed reduction of operator
time, helped reduce costs, and allowed detection of both symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases.
CONCLUSION: After 8 months of protocol implementation, the strategy to
intensively survey groups at higher epidemiological risk and the systematic
search for asymptomatic cases with the incorporation of pooled PCR for diagnosis,
in combination with individual testing, is an efficient and viable option in
populations with similar characteristics, in the frame of social isolation.
