An increasing body of evidence has been produced in a very limited period to
improve the understanding of skin involvement in the current coronavirus 2019
disease pandemic, and how this novel disease affects the management of
dermatologic patients. A little explored area is represented by the therapeutic
approach adopted for the different skin manifestations associated with the
infection. An overview of the current scenario is provided, through review of the
English-language literature published until October 30, 2020, and comparison with
the personal experience of the authors. As dermatologists, our primary aim is to 
support patients with the highest standard of care and relieve suffering, even
with lesions not life-threatening. With asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, patient
discomfort related to skin lesions should not be undervalued and intervention to 
accelerate healing should be provided. Consensus protocols are warranted to
assess the best skin-targeted treatments in COVID-19 patients.
