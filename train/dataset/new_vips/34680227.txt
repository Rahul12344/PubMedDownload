Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
activation and mutagenic consequences of L1 retrotransposons in
virus-associated-HCC have been documented. However, the direct influence of HCV
upon L1 elements is unclear, and is the focus of the present study. L1 transcript
expression was evaluated in a publicly available liver tissue RNA-seq dataset
from patients with chronic HCV hepatitis (CHC), as well as healthy controls. L1
transcript expression was significantly higher in CHC than in controls. L1orf1p
(a L1 encoded protein) expression was observed in six out of 11 CHC livers by
immunohistochemistry. To evaluate the influence of HCV on retrotransposition
efficiency, in vitro engineered-L1 retrotransposition assays were employed in
Huh7 cells in the presence and absence of an HCV replicon. An increased
retrotransposition rate was observed in the presence of replicating HCV RNA, and 
persisted in cells after viral clearance due to sofosbuvir (PSI7977) treatment.
Increased retrotransposition could be due to dysregulation of the DNA-damage
repair response, including homologous recombination, due to HCV infection.
Altogether these data suggest that L1 expression can be activated before
oncogenic transformation in CHC patients, with HCV-upregulated retrotransposition
potentially contributing to HCC genomic instability and a risk of transformation 
that persists post-viral clearance.
