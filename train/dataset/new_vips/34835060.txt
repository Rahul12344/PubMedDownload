Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is characterized by a diverse group of congenital 
malformations induced by ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Type III interferons
have been associated with placental immunity against ZIKV and restriction of
vertical transmission in mice, and non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) on these genes are well known to influence susceptibility to other viral
infections. However, their effect on ZIKV pathogenesis has not yet been explored.
To investigate whether maternal non-coding SNPs at IFNL genes are associated with
CZS, 52 women infected with ZIKV during pregnancy were enrolled in a case-control
association study. A total of 28 women were classified as cases and 24 as
controls based on the presence or absence of CZS in their infants, and seven
Interferon-λ non-coding SNPs (rs12980275, rs8099917, rs4803217, rs4803219,
rs8119886, rs368234815, rs12979860) were genotyped. The results of logistic
regression analyses show an association between the G allele at rs8099917 and
increased susceptibility to CZS under a log-additive model (adjustedOR = 2.80;
95%CI = 1.14-6.91; p = 0.02), after adjustment for trimester of infection and
genetic ancestry. These results provide evidence of an association between
Interferon-λ SNPs and CZS, suggesting rs8099917 as a promising candidate for
further studies on larger cohorts.
