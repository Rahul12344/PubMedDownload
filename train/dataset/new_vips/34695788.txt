As the COVID-19 pandemic takes its toll on citizens across the globe, more people
turn to sex work for survival. Because sex work is inherently physical and
intimate, sex workers become defenseless against the virus and act as a bridge
for transmitting the virus to their clients and society. Often, sex workers are
the victims of violence and homelessness, and are devoid of health-care
facilities, including HIV treatment, and are frequently exposed to a large number
of individuals as dictated by the nature of their work. Their survival instincts 
would drive them to take part in their usual job to earn money, despite added
health risks, to survive and feed their families. Worldwide, sex workers do not
fully benefit from the COVID-19 responses, particularly in health, social, and
economic aid assistance and services. Hence, it is essential to include this
vulnerable population in the COVID-19 vaccination programs to halt the further
spread of the virus.
