ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions' diagnostic processes
worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an artificial
intelligence (AI)-based software tool that automatically evaluates chest computed
tomography for findings of suspected COVID-19.Two groups were retrospectively
evaluated for COVID-19-associated ground glass opacities of the lungs (group A:
real-time polymerase chain reaction positive COVID patients, n = 108; group B:
asymptomatic pre-operative group, n = 88). The performance of an AI-based
software assessment tool for detection of COVID-associated abnormalities was
compared with human evaluation based on COVID-19 reporting and data system
(CO-RADS) scores performed by 3 readers.All evaluated variables of the AI-based
assessment showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P < .01). The
inter-reader reliability of CO-RADS scoring was 0.87. The CO-RADS scores were
substantially higher in group A (mean 4.28) than group B (mean 1.50). The
difference between CO-RADS scoring and AI assessment was statistically
significant for all variables but showed good correlation with the clinical
context of the CO-RADS score. AI allowed to predict COVID positive cases with an 
accuracy of 0.94.The evaluated AI-based algorithm detects COVID-19-associated
findings with high sensitivity and may support radiologic workflows during the
pandemic.
