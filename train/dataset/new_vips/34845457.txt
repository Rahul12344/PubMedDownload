Severe COVID-19 induces molecular signatures of aging in the human brain.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is predominantly an acute respiratory disease
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
remains a significant threat to public health. COVID-19 is accompanied by
neurological symptoms and cognitive decline, but the molecular mechanisms
underlying this effect remain unclear. As aging induces distinct molecular
signatures in the brain associated with cognitive decline in healthy populations,
we hypothesized that COVID-19 may induce molecular signatures of aging. Here, we 
performed whole transcriptomic analysis of human frontal cortex, a critical area 
for cognitive function, in 12 COVID-19 cases and age- and sex-matched uninfected 
controls. COVID-19 induces profound changes in gene expression, despite the
absence of detectable virus in brain tissue. Pathway analysis shows
downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function and cognition and
upregulation of genes involved in immune processes. Comparison with five
independent transcriptomic datasets of aging human frontal cortex reveals
striking similarities between aged individuals and severe COVID-19 patients.
Critically, individuals below 65 years of age exhibit profound transcriptomic
changes not observed among older individuals in our patient cohort. Our data
indicate that severe COVID-19 induces molecular signatures of aging in the human 
brain and emphasize the value of neurological follow-up in recovered individuals.
