Enterovirus (EV) infection rarely results in life-threatening infection of the
central nervous system. We report two unrelated children with EV30 and EV71
rhombencephalitis. One patient carries compound heterozygous TLR3 variants
(loss-of-function F322fs2* and hypomorphic D280N), and the other is homozygous
for an IFIH1 variant (loss-of-function c.1641+1G>C). Their fibroblasts respond
poorly to extracellular (TLR3) or intracellular (MDA5) poly(I:C) stimulation. The
baseline (TLR3) and EV-responsive (MDA5) levels of IFN-β in the patients'
fibroblasts are low. EV growth is enhanced at early and late time points of
infection in TLR3- and MDA5-deficient fibroblasts, respectively. Treatment with
exogenous IFN-α2b before infection renders both cell lines resistant to EV30 and 
EV71, whereas post-infection treatment with IFN-α2b rescues viral susceptibility 
fully only in MDA5-deficient fibroblasts. Finally, the poly(I:C) and viral
phenotypes of fibroblasts are rescued by the expression of WT TLR3 or MDA5. Human
TLR3 and MDA5 are critical for cell-intrinsic immunity to EV, via the control of 
baseline and virus-induced type I IFN production, respectively.
