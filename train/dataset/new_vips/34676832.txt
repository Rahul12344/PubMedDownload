Knowledge of immune activation in the brain during acute HIV infection is crucial
for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated neurological disorders. We
determined regional brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex) immune
and virological profiles at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) with SIVmac239 in 
rhesus macaques. The basal ganglia and thalamus had detectable viruses earlier (7
dpi) than the frontal cortex (14 dpi) and contained higher quantities of viruses 
than the latter. Increased immune activation of astrocytes and significant
infiltration of macrophages in the thalamus at 14 dpi coincided with elevated
plasma viral load, and SIV colocalized only within macrophages. RNA signatures of
proinflammatory responses, including IL-6, were detected at 7 dpi in microglia
and interestingly, preceded reliable detection of virus in tissues and were
maintained in the chronically infected macaques. Countering the proinflammatory
response, the antiinflammatory response was not detected until increased TGF-Î²
expression was found in perivascular macrophages at 14 dpi. But this response was
not detected in chronic infection. Our data provide evidence that the interplay
of acute proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses in the brain likely
contributed to the overt neuroinflammation, where the immune activation preceded 
reliable viral detection.
