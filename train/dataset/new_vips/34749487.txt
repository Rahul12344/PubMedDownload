Objectives: There is no data available in Indonesia to measure the main
indicators of Zero New Infection, Zero AIDS-related death and Zero Stigma and
Discrimination. This study aims to determine factors related to misconceptions
about HIV transmission and stigma against PLWHA in Indonesia.
Methods: Cross-sectional study used secondary data from the 2017 Indonesia
Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS). The sample was women and men aged 17-45
years (N = 3023).
Results: There are two variables that are significantly related to misconceptions
about HIV transmission, namely educational level and wealth index quintile. The
lower the education level of the respondents, the more likely they are to
experience misconceptions about HIV transmission. Respondents who were in the
poorest, poorer, middle and richer wealth index were more likely of experiencing 
misconceptions about HIV transmission as compared to respondents who were in the 
richest. Educational level, employment status and wealth index quintile are
predictors of stigma against PLWHA.
Conclusion: There are still many Indonesian people who experience misconceptions 
about HIV transmission and the magnitude of the stigma against PLWHA. Future
studies should focus more on education programs or interventions aimed at
increasing public knowledge and awareness, promoting compassion towards PLWHA and
emphasizing on respect for the rights of PLWHA particularly in the population who
are in poverty and uneducated.
