African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent of the devastating
disease African swine fever (ASF), for which there is currently no licensed
vaccine or treatment available. ASF is defined as one of the most serious animal 
diseases identified to date, due to its global spread in regions of Africa,
Europe and Asia, causing massive economic losses. On the Italian island of
Sardinia, the disease has been endemic since 1978, although the last control
measures put in place achieved a significant reduction in ASF, and the virus has 
been absent from circulation since April 2019. Like many large DNA viruses, ASFV 
mutates at a relatively slow rate. However, the limited availability of
whole-genome sequences from spatial-localized outbreaks makes it difficult to
explore the small-scale genetic structure of these ASFV outbreaks. It is also
unclear if the genetic variability within outbreaks can be captured in a handful 
of sequences, or if larger sequencing efforts can improve phylogenetic
reconstruction and evolutionary or epidemiological inference. The aim of this
study was to investigate the phylogenetic patterns of ASFV outbreaks between 1978
and 2018 in Sardinia, in order to characterize the epidemiological dynamics of
the viral strains circulating in this Mediterranean island. To reach this goal,
58 new whole genomes of ASFV isolates were obtained, which represents the largest
ASFV whole-genome sequencing effort to date. We provided a complete description
of the genomic diversity of ASFV in terms of nucleotide mutations and small and
large indels among the isolates collected during the outbreaks. The new sequences
capture more than twice the genomic and phylogenetic diversity of all the
previously published Sardinian sequences. The extra genomic diversity increases
the resolution of the phylogenetic reconstruction, enabling us to dissect, for
the first time, the genetic substructure of the outbreak. We found multiple ASFV 
subclusters within the phylogeny of the Sardinian epidemic, some of which
coexisted in space and time.
