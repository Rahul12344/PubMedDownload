Serological tests are beneficial for recognizing the immune response against
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). To identify
protective immunity, optimization of the chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing 
test (CRNT) is critical. Whether commercial antibody tests have comparable
accuracy is unknown. Serum samples were obtained from COVID-19 patients (n = 74),
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (n = 179), and suspected healthy individuals (n = 229)
before SARS-CoV-2 variants had been detected locally. The convalescent phase was 
defined as the period after day 10 from disease onset or the episode of close
contact. The CRNT using pseudotyped viruses displaying the wild-type (WT) spike
protein and a commercial anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody test were
assayed. Serology for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants was also assayed. Both
tests concurred for symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the convalescent phase. They
clearly differentiated between patients and suspected healthy individuals
(sensitivity: 95.8% and 100%, respectively; specificity: 99.1% and 100%,
respectively). Anti-RBD antibody test results correlated with neutralizing titers
(r = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.38). Compared with the WT, lower
CRNT values were observed for the variants. Of the samples with ≥100 U/mL by the 
anti-RBD antibody test, 77.8% and 88.9% showed ≥50% neutralization against the
B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 variants, respectively. Exceeding 100 U/mL in the
anti-RBD antibody test was associated with neutralization of variants (P < 0.01).
The CRNT and commercial anti-RBD antibody test effectively classified
convalescent COVID-19 patients. Strong positive results with the anti-RBD
antibody test can reflect neutralizing activity against emerging variants.
IMPORTANCE This study provides a diagnostic evidence of test validity, which can 
lead to vaccine efficacy and proof of recovery after COVID-19. It is not easy to 
know neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical laboratory because of
technical and biohazard issues. The correlation of the quantitative
anti-receptor-binding domain antibody test, which is widely available, with
neutralizing test indicates that we can know indirectly the state of acquisition 
of functional immunity against wild and variant-type viruses in the clinical
laboratory.
