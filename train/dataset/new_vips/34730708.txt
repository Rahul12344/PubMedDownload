OBJECTIVE: To describe the space-time evolution of cases and deaths due to
COVID-19 in the Rio de Janeiro municipality, Brazil, during the first year of the
pandemic.
METHODS: An ecological study was carried out. The units of analysis were the
neighborhoods of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Incidence and mortality rates,
excess risk, Global Moran's Index (Moran's I), local indicator for spatial
association, standardized incidence ratio, and standardized mortality ratio were 
estimated for neighborhoods in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.
RESULTS: Over the first year of the pandemic, registries in the city of Rio de
Janeiro included 204,888 cases and 19,017 deaths due to COVID-19. During the
first three months of the pandemic, higher incidence rates were verified in the
municipality compared with the state of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, in addition to
higher mortality rates compared with the state of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil from 
May 2020 to February 2021. Bonsucesso was the neighborhood with the highest
incidence and mortality rates, and throughout the neighborhoods and months, there
is no synchrony between the worst moments of the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: The authors emphasize the need for implementing more rigid control
and prevention measures, increasing case detection, and accelerating the COVID-19
immunization campaign.
