BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) vaccines are available in Spain since 2006 but are not
included in the National Immunization Program. RV vaccination has reached an
intermediate vaccination coverage rate (VCR) but with substantial differences
between provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the ratio of RV
gastroenteritis (RVGE) admissions to all-cause hospitalizations in children under
5 years of age in areas with different VCR.
METHODS: Observational, multicenter, cross-sectional, medical record-based study.
All children admitted to the study hospitals with a RVGE confirmed diagnosis
during a 5-year period were selected. The annual ratio of RVGE to the total
number of all-cause hospitalizations in children < 5 years of age were
calculated. The proportion of RVGE hospitalizations were compared in areas with
low (< 30%), intermediate (31-59%) and high (> 60%) VCR.
RESULTS: From June 2013 to May 2018, data from 1731 RVGE hospitalizations (16.47%
of which were nosocomial) were collected from the 12 study hospitals. RVGE
hospital admissions accounted for 2.82% (95 CI 2.72-3.00) and 43.84% (95% CI
40.53-47.21) of all-cause and Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalizations in
children under 5 years of age, respectively. The likelihood of hospitalization
due to RVGE was 56% (IC95%, 51-61%) and 27% (IC95%, 18-35%) lower in areas with
high and intermediate VCR, respectively, compared to the low VCR areas.
CONCLUSIONS: RVGE hospitalization ratios are highly dependent on the RV VCR.
Increasing VCR in areas with intermediate and low coverage rates would
significantly reduce the severe burden of RVGE that requires hospital management 
in Spain. Clinical trial registration Not applicable.
