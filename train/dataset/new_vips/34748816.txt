West Nile virus (WNV) and Wesselsbron virus (WSLV) are mosquito-borne viruses
belonging to the Flavivirus genus, family Flaviviridae and cause outbreaks in
southern Africa after heavy rain. Isothermal assays have been proposed for
application in field situations as well as low resource settings and hence we
developed a reverse-transcriptase recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)
to detect WNV and WSLV known to occur in South Africa, causing sporadic outbreaks
usually associated with good rainfall favouring mosquito breeding. Infectious
virus can only be handled within a biosafety level (BSL) 3 facility, hence we
opted to validate the assay with transcribed RNA. Specific RT-RPA primers and
probes were designed for detection of WNV and WSLV and products detected using a 
rapid lateral flow device. The assay was performed in 30 min and detected 1.9 ×
10¹ copies of WNV and 3.5 × 10° copies WSLV using noninfectious transcribed RNA
controls. In addition, the assay was not inhibited by the presence of mosquito
extracts in spiked samples. Mismatches between the WNV and WSLV probes and other 
flaviviruses will likely prevent cross reactivity. The sensitivity, low RPA
incubation temperature and rapid processing time makes assay systems based on RPA
technology ideally suited for fieldable diagnostics.
