Understanding SARS-CoV-2 immune pathology is critical for the development of
effective vaccines and treatments. Here, we employed unbiased serial whole-blood 
transcriptome profiling by weighted gene network correlation analysis (WGCNA) at 
pre-specified timepoints of infection to understand SARS-CoV-2-related immune
alterations in a cohort of rhesus macaques (RMs) and African green monkeys (AGMs)
presenting with varying degrees of pulmonary pathology. We found that the bulk of
transcriptional changes occurred at day 3 post-infection and normalized to
pre-infection levels by 3 weeks. There was evidence of coordination of
transcriptional networks in blood (defined by WGCNA) and the nasopharyngeal
SARS-CoV-2 burden as well as the absolute monocyte count. Pathway analysis of
gene modules revealed prominent regulation of type I and type II interferon
stimulated genes (ISGs) in both RMs and AGMs, with the latter species exhibiting 
a greater breadth of ISG upregulation. Notably, pathways relating to neutrophil
degranulation were enriched in blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected AGMs, but not RMs.
Our results elude to hallmark similarities as well as differences in the RM and
AGM acute response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may help guide the selection of
particular NHP species in modeling aspects of COVID-19 disease outcome.
