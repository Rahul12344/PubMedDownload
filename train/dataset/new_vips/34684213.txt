Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) emerges periodically from its focus of endemic
transmission in southern Mexico to cause epizootics in livestock in the US. The
ecology of VSV involves a diverse, but largely undefined, repertoire of potential
reservoir hosts and invertebrate vectors. As part of a larger program to decipher
VSV transmission, we conducted a study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of Simulium
black flies, a known vector of VSV, along the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico, 
USA from March to December 2020. Serendipitously, the index case of VSV-Indiana
(VSIV) in the USA in 2020 occurred at a central point of our study. Black flies
appeared soon after the release of the Rio Grande's water from an upstream dam in
March 2020. Two-month and one-year lagged precipitation, maximum temperature, and
vegetation greenness, measured as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 
were associated with increased black fly abundance. We detected VSIV RNA in 11
pools comprising five black fly species using rRT-PCR; five pools yielded a VSIV 
sequence. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of VSV in the western US 
from vectors that were not collected on premises with infected domestic animals.
