The COVID-19 pandemic remains a major concern in the Eastern Mediterranean
Region. At time of writing, nearly 300 000 deaths from the disease have been
reported, and that figure almost certainly understates the reality. The Region is
facing another wave of infection; the Delta variant is widespread; and while some
countries have achieved impressively high vaccination rates, overall coverage in 
the Region is far too low at around 15%. Ensuring equitable access to COVID-19
vaccine across all 22 countries and territories in the Region is an urgent
priority.
