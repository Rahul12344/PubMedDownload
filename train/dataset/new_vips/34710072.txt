BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we scaled up telemedicine and
rideshare services for clinic and laboratory visits for pediatric and adolescent 
patients with HIV.
SETTING: HIV subspecialty program for patients aged 0-24 years at Children's
National Hospital, Washington, DC.
METHODS: Using the χ2 and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, we compared demographics,
visit and laboratory data, and rideshare usage among patients who scheduled
telemedicine at least once (telemedicine) versus those who never scheduled
telemedicine (no-telemedicine) during the pandemic (April-September 2020). We
compared the number and proportion of scheduled and completed clinic visits
before the pandemic (April-September 2019) with those during the pandemic.
RESULTS: We analyzed 178 pediatric and adolescent patients with HIV (median age
17.9 years, 89.3% Black, 48.9% male patients, 78.7% perinatally infected), of
whom 70.2% and 28.6% used telemedicine and rideshare, respectively. Telemedicine 
patients scheduled more visits (236 vs 179, P < 0.0001) and completed a similar
proportion of visits (81.8% vs 86.0%, P = 0.3805) compared with no-telemedicine
patients. Laboratory testing rates (81.3% versus 98.5%, P = 0.0005) were lower in
telemedicine patients compared with no-telemedicine patients. Rideshare usage
(12.4% versus 26.5%, P = 0.0068) was lower in telemedicine versus no-telemedicine
patients. During the pandemic, most of the patients (81.0%) had HIV RNA <200
copies/mL. The total number of completed visits and the proportion of visits
completed were similar before and during the pandemic.
CONCLUSION: Most of the pediatric and adolescent patients with HIV used
telemedicine and maintained HIV RNA <200 copies/mL during the pandemic. Despite
rideshare usage, laboratory testing rates were lower with telemedicine compared
with in-person visits.
