INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B and C viruses are among the leading causes of health
problems globally, and their early diagnosis and treatment are very important.
Thereby, this study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of functional 
diagnostic tests to detect hepatitis B and C viruses in the clinical setting and 
compare them with each other.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review article, we have searched major online
databases, including PubMed and EMBASE. Forty-two retrieved articles, published
between January 2000 and January 2020, are summarized in this review.
RESULTS: Immunoassay approaches are general techniques for identifying pathogenic
agents, among which ELISA is the gold standard for the detection of HBsAg. While 
serological techniques are not conclusive, Molecular assays are really important 
because of the high sensitivity to detect chronic hepatitis B without HBeAg, in
which viral loads are very low. Biosensors have higher selectivity and
sensitivity and faster responses compared to other methods.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that all molecular, serological, and
biotechnological assays have advantages and disadvantages for diagnosing
hepatitis B and C viruses, depending on the condition. Therefore, we should
choose one of them in regards to time, cost, and laboratory equipment along with 
the clinical symptoms.
