A simple, rapid and robust method to quantify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies 
(nAbs) is urgently needed for determining COVID-19 serodiagnosis, vaccine
development and evaluation of vaccine efficacy. In this study, we report
sandwich/competitive immuno-sensors based on lateral chromatography
micro-interface for accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs. Fluorescent
microspheres (FMS) labeled receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen was prepared for
detection of nAbs with high sensitivity. Sandwich and competitive immunoassay
were conducted on the microfluidic-based sensor within 10 min and the fluorescent
signal of immunoassay was analyzed by a portable microfluidic immunoassay
instrument. The nAbs detection range of sandwich immuno-sensor and competitive
immuno-sensor was 4.0 ng/mL to 400 ng/mL and 2.13 ng/mL to 213 ng/mL,
respectively. Furthermore, the sandwich immuno-sensor was demonstrated to be
comparable with existing methods and used to detect 182 clinical serum samples
from vaccinated individuals. Sandwich immuno-sensor based on lateral
chromatography micro-interface allowed reliable, fast, and low-cost detection of 
nAbs, which holds considerable potential for nAbs testing.
