Background: Globally, social distancing has been practiced during the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to prevent the transmission of the
virus. One of the measures to ensure social distancing and restricting the
movements has been national lockdown, to break the chain of transmission.
Telemedicine is a cost-effective measure to provide medical services to remote
underserved areas.
Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of 
teleconsultation as an alternative option to in-person consultation in providing 
continued medical care for neurology patients during the national lockdown period
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Materials and Methods: The clinical demographic profile, frequency of different
neurological disorders, and treatment details of the patients attending the
teleneurology consultation (TNCO) outpatient department (OPD) at Sir Sunderlal
Hospital (S.S.H.), Institute of Medical Sciences (I.M.S.), BHU, Varanasi, India, 
were recorded in a prespecified pro forma.
Results: A total of 1,567 patients attended the TNCO OPD over 90 days. The
average patient attendance was 35 per day, and 72% were males. Out of these, 77% 
of patients were from the same district, and the majority of patients (68%) were 
regularly followed up in-person by the neurology OPD. The most common illness for
consultation was epilepsy (19%) followed by low backache and stroke (18% each).
The satisfaction rate among the patients with respect to teleservices was high
(90%).
Conclusion: TNCO seems to be as effective as in-person OPD in the management of
neurological disorders. During the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
avoiding physical visits through TNCO may reduce the spread of the virus.
Parallel tele-OPD with routine OPD is a good option in the future.
