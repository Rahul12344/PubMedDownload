Background and purpose: Virus-containing aerosol droplets emitted by breathing,
speech or coughing dry rapidly to equilibrium with ambient relative humidity
(RH), increasing in solute concentration with effects on virus survival and
decreasing in diameter with effects on sedimentation and respiratory uptake. The 
aim of this paper is to model the effect of ionic and macromolecular solutes on
droplet drying and solute concentration.
Methods: Deliquescence-efflorescence concepts and Kohler theory were used to
simulate the evolution of solute concentrations and water activity in respiratory
droplets, starting from efflorescence data on mixed NaCl/KCl aerosols and osmotic
pressure data on respiratory macromolecules.
Results: In NaCl/KCl solutions total salt concentrations were shown to reach
10-13 M at the efflorescence RH of 40-55%, depending on the K:Na ratio.
Dependence on K:Na ratio implies that the evaporation curves differ between
aerosols derived from saliva and from airway surfaces. The direct effect of
liquid droplet size through the Kelvin term was shown to be smaller and
restricted to the evolution of breath emissions. Modelling the effect of proteins
and glycoproteins showed that salts determine drying equilibria down to the
efflorescence RH, and macromolecules at lower RH.
Conclusion: Differences in solute composition between airway surfaces and saliva 
are predicted to lead to different drying behaviour of droplets emitted by
breathing, speech and coughing. These differences may influence the inactivation 
of viruses.
