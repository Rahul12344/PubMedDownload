OBJECTIVES: to present an evaluation of the campaign for vaccination against
COVID-19 in the territory covered by the Agency for Health Protection of the
Metropolitan Area of Milan from 01.01.2021 to 30.09.2021.
DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccine adherence; predictive study of the factors
associated with vaccine adherence, efficacy of vaccination in terms of
hospitalization and mortality, and factors that increase the risk of hospital
admission following full vaccination.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population-based study with subjects aged >18 years
eligible for vaccination (N. 2,981,997). An information system obtained by
integrating various administrative healthcare sources made it possible to analyse
socioeconomic characteristics, COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and general
mortality in subjects eligible for vaccination.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: full vaccination (2 doses); COVID-19-related
hospitalizations, COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurring more than 15 days
after the second dose, general mortality.
RESULTS: in the first nine months of the vaccination campaign, 74.7% of the
subjects (N. 2,228,915) was fully vaccinated, whereas 15.6% (N. 465,829) did not 
even receive one dose. Women have a lower probability of getting vaccinated than 
men; the 50-59 years and 70+ years age groups emerge as the most problematic to
reach, while the younger one (<40) is the most adherent. A social gradient
emerged, with residents of more disadvantaged areas progressively less incline to
get vaccinated than those living in more affluent areas. Adherence is greater in 
Italian citizenship and is likely to increase with an increase in the number of
chronic conditions. Hospitalizations amounted to 1.22% (N. 5,672) in the
unvaccinated population compared to 0.05% (N. 1,013) in the vaccinated
population; general mortality was 4.51% (N. 15,198) in the unvaccinated
population against 0.32% (N. 8.733) in the vaccinated population.
Sociodemographic factors and the presence of previous health conditions are
important predictors of hospitalization outcomes even within the fully vaccinated
population. Specifically, the highest hazard ratios are found in subjects with
heart failure (HR 2.15; 95%CI 1.83-2.53), in immunocompromised patients (HR 2.02;
95%CI 1.52-2.69), and in transplant recipients (HR 1.92; 95%CI 1.10-3.33).
CONCLUSIONS: vaccination campaign adherence is affected by the sociodemographic
characteristics of the population and is a determining factor in preventing
hospitalizations for COVID-19 and death. The persistent higher risk of
hospitalization in chronic subjects following the second dose emphasizes the need
to direct booster doses to the more vulnerable. Information systems proved to be 
effective monitoring tools in the absence of specific trials.
