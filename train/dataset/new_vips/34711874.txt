The COVID-19 pandemic was an inevitable outcome of a globalized world in which a 
highly infective disease is able to reach every country in a matter of weeks.
While lockdowns and strong mobility restrictions have proven to be efficient to
contain the exponential transmission of the virus, its pervasiveness has made it 
impossible for economies to maintain this kind of measures in time. Understanding
precisely how the spread of the virus occurs from a territorial perspective is
crucial not only to prevent further infections but also to help with policy
design regarding human mobility. From the large spatial differences in the
behavior of the virus spread we can unveil which areas have been more vulnerable 
to it and why, and with this information try to assess the risk that each
community has to suffer a future outbreak of infection. In this work we have
analyzed the geographical distribution of the cumulative incidence during the
first wave of the pandemic in the region of Galicia (north western part of
Spain), and developed a mathematical approach that assigns a risk factor for each
of the different municipalities that compose the region. This risk factor is
independent of the actual evolution of the pandemic and incorporates geographic
and demographic information. The comparison with empirical information from the
first pandemic wave demonstrates the validity of the method. Our results can
potentially be used to design appropriate preventive policies that help to
contain the virus.
