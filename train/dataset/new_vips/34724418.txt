Racial health inequities exemplified during the COVID-19 crisis have awakened a
sense of urgency among public health and policy experts to examine contributing
factors. One potential factor includes the socioeconomic disadvantage of racially
segregated neighborhoods. This study quantified associations of neighborhood
socioeconomic disadvantage in Chicago, Illinois, as measured by the Area
Deprivation Index (ADI), with racial disparities in COVID-19 positivity. A
retrospective cohort included 16,684 patients tested for COVID-19 at an academic 
medical center and five community-based testing sites during Chicago's "first
wave" (March 12, 2020-June 25, 2020). Patients living in Black majority
neighborhoods had two times higher odds of COVID-19 positivity relative to those 
in White majority neighborhoods. The ADI accounted for 20 percent of the racial
disparity; however, COVID-19 positivity remained substantially higher at every
decile of the ADI in Black relative to White neighborhoods. The remaining
disparities (80 percent) suggest a large, cumulative effect of other structural
disadvantages in urban communities of color.
