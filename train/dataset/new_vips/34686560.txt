OBJECTIVES: The steroid hormone vitamin D has roles in immunomodulation and bone 
health. Insufficiency is associated with susceptibility to respiratory
infections. We report 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements in hospitalised
people with COVID-19 and influenza A and in survivors of critical illness to test
the hypotheses that vitamin D insufficiency scales with illness severity and
persists in survivors.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Plasma was obtained from 295 hospitalised people with
COVID-19 (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections
Consortium (ISARIC)/WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging
Infections UK study), 93 with influenza A (Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza
Consortium (MOSAIC) study, during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic) and 139 survivors 
of non-selected critical illness (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Total 25(OH)D 
was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Free 25(OH)D was 
measured by ELISA in COVID-19 samples.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and
in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Vitamin D insufficiency (total 25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L) and deficiency
(<25 nmol/L) were prevalent in COVID-19 (29.3% and 44.4%, respectively),
influenza A (47.3% and 37.6%) and critical illness survivors (30.2% and 56.8%).
In COVID-19 and influenza A, total 25(OH)D measured early in illness was lower in
patients who received IMV (19.6 vs 31.9 nmol/L (p<0.0001) and 22.9 vs 31.1 nmol/L
(p=0.0009), respectively). In COVID-19, biologically active free 25(OH)D
correlated with total 25(OH)D and was lower in patients who received IMV, but was
not associated with selected circulating inflammatory mediators.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was present in majority of
hospitalised patients with COVID-19 or influenza A and correlated with severity
and persisted in critical illness survivors at concentrations expected to disrupt
bone metabolism. These findings support early supplementation trials to determine
if insufficiency is causal in progression to severe disease, and investigation of
longer-term bone health outcomes.
