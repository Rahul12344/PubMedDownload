The National Association of School Nurses supports pandemic control efforts.
School nurses are advocates for their students, caregivers, school staff,
teachers, and school administrators. With a clear understanding of how the
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus evolves over
time and changes transmissibility through mutations, school nurses gain
understanding in epidemiologic calculation of herd immunity. To understand why
the estimates of herd immunity fluctuate, as often reported in the news, school
nurses need to understand how epidemiologist calculate this number. Obtaining
herd immunity will protect the most vulnerable in the population. If all
countries have access to vaccines and populations choose to receive vaccinations,
herd immunity is more likely to be obtained. Equipped with knowledge of how herd 
immunity is calculated, school nurses are in a position to educate and advocate
for the use of vaccines.
