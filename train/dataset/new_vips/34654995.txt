School connectedness is consistently associated with adolescent mental health and
well-being. We investigated whether student perceptions of school connectedness
were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, even during remote learning
due to COVID-19. In June of 2020, after 13 weeks of remote learning, 320 middle
and high school students in one Massachusetts school district completed an online
survey that included questions about their perceptions of school connectedness,
social connectedness, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Students were
approximately evenly distributed across grades, with 37% in middle school (grades
6-8) and 63% in high school (grades 9-12). School connectedness had a significant
negative association with symptoms of anxiety and depression. This association
persisted in models controlling for demographic factors and social connectedness.
Findings indicate that school connectedness is associated with student mental
health, even in the context of remote learning due to COVID-19. Schools engaged
in remote learning should consider how to foster school connectedness as a means 
of supporting youth mental health, particularly given expected increases in the
mental health needs of adolescents.
