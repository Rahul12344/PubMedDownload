Drug delivery to tumor sites using nanotechnology has been demonstrated to
overcome the drawbacks of conventional anticancer drugs. Altering the surface
shape and geometry of nanocomposites alters their chemical properties, which can 
confer multiple attributes to nanocarriers for the treatment of cancer and their 
use as imaging agents for cancer diagnosis. However, heterogeneity and blood flow
in human cancer limit the distribution of nanoparticles at the site of tumor
tisues. For targeted delivery and controlled release of drug molecules in harsh
tumor microenvironments, smart nanocarriers combined with various
stimuli-responsive materials have been developed. In this review, we describe
nanomaterials for smart anticancer therapy as well as their pharmaceutical
aspects including pharmaceutical process, formulation, controlled drug release,
drug targetability, and pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles of smart
nanocarriers. Inorganic or organic-inorganic hybrid nanoplatforms and the
electrospinning process have also been briefly described here.
