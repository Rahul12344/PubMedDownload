A novel porcine circovirus 4 has been recently identified in China and Korea. A
sensitive and specific diagnostic method is urgently required to detect the virus
in field samples. We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
the assay for the visual detection of PCV4 and evaluated its sensitivity,
specificity, and applicability in clinical samples. This assay's results can be
directly visualized by the naked eye using hydroxynaphthol blue after incubation 
for 40 min at 64 °C. The assay specifically amplified PCV4 DNA and no other viral
nucleic acids. The sensitivity of the assay was <50 DNA copies/reaction, which
was 10 times more sensitive than conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR)
and comparable to real-time PCR (qPCR). Clinical evaluation revealed that the
PCV4 detection rate in individual pig samples and at the farm level was 39.3 %
(57/145) and 45.7 % (32/70), respectively, which were higher than cPCR (46
samples, 24 farms) and qPCR (52 samples, 29 farms) results. Cumulatively, owing
to the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity, direct visual monitoring
of the results, no possibility for cross-contamination, and being a low-cost
equipment, the developed LAMP assay will be a valuable tool for the detection of 
the novel PCV4 in clinical samples, even in resource-limited laboratories.
