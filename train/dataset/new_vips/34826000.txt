Archival swine DNA samples from Indonesia and Mongolia, some of which were
previously shown to be positive for African swine fever virus, were screened for 
the presence of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) and porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) by 
PCR. Samples from both countries were positive for PCV-2 (three from Mongolia and
two from Indonesia), while none were positive for PCV-3. The PCV-2 amplicons were
sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PCV-2 strains belonged to 
four different genotypes: PCV-2a (Mongolia), PCV-2b (Mongolia and Indonesia),
PCV-2d (Indonesia), and PCV-2g (Mongolia). This is the first report of ASFV/PCV-2
coinfection in pigs and the first report of the presence of PCV-2 in Mongolia.
