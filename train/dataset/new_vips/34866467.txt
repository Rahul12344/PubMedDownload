Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to disproportionately affect gay,
bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) and transgender and nonbinary
(trans/NB) individuals. This study investigated attitudes toward participation in
HIV survey research, guided by Emanuel's framework for ethical clinical research 
(e.g., risk-benefit ratio, fair participant selection, respect for participants, 
social value, and collaborative partnership). GBM (n = 294) and trans/NB (n = 86)
persons recruited at a Pride event in Milwaukee completed a survey assessing
risks and benefits of participation in, and comfort responding to, sexual health 
surveys. Participants reported few ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and
confidentiality), with notable differences by race, sexual orientation and gender
identity, and prior research experiences. Implications for HIV research with GBM 
and trans/NB individuals are discussed.
