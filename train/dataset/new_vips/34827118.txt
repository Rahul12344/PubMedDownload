Begomoviruses and associated DNA satellites are involved in pathosystems that
include many cultivated and wild dicot plants and the whitefly vector Bemisia
tabaci. A survey of leguminous plants, both crops and wild species, was conducted
in Venezuela, an understudied country, to determine the presence of
begomoviruses. Molecular analysis identified the presence of bipartite
begomoviruses in 37% of the collected plants. Four of the six begomoviruses
identified constituted novel species, and two others had not been previously
reported in Venezuela. In addition, a novel deltasatellite (cabbage leaf curl
deltasatellite, CabLCD) was found to be associated with cabbage leaf curl virus
(CabLCV) in several plant species. CabLCD was the first deltasatellite found to
infect legumes and the first found in the New World to infect a crop plant.
Agroinoculation experiments using Nicotiana benthamiana plants and infectious
viral clones confirmed that CabLCV acts as a helper virus for CabLCD. The
begomovirus-deltasatellite complex described here is also present in wild legume 
plants, suggesting the possible role of these plants in the emergence and
establishment of begomoviral diseases in the main legume crops in the region.
Pathological knowledge of these begomovirus-deltasatellite complexes is
fundamental to develop control methods to protect leguminous crops from the
diseases they cause.
