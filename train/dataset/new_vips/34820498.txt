Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a complex emerging arboviral hemorrhagic disease that 
causes significant illness in animals and humans. Camel trade across the land
borders between Nigeria and the Niger Republic occurs frequently and poses a
significant risk for RVF transmission to pastoralists and traders. We carried a
cross-sectional study between November 2016 and April 2017 in two northern States
(Katsina and Jigawa) known for camel trade in Nigeria to investigate the
seroprevalence and potential risk factors for RVFV occurrence. We collected 720
sera and administered questionnaire to pastoralists. We used the competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) to determine the previous exposure to
RVFV infection. We retrieved  environmental information from public data sources 
that might explain RVFV seropositivity at  the LGA level. To asses potential risk
factors,we categorized LGAs with RVFV as "1" and those without a case" 0". We
fitted a logistic model to the data  and estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals. An overall 19.9% prevalence was reported among camel herd-the highest 
seropositivity (33.3%) was recorded in SuleTankarkar LGA. In the multivariable
model, only rain-fed croplands was significantly associated with RVFV antibodies 
occurrence p = 0.048 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76-0.99). Only a minority of the
respondents, 19.3% (n = 17/88), knew that RVF is zoonotic. Separation of healthy 
animals from the infected animals was carried out by 53.4% (47/88) pastoralists
while 59.1% (52/88) pastoralists still use ethnoveterinary practices to control
or mitigate disease outbreaks. Our study demonstrates the presence of RVFV
antibodies among camel in Nigeria and the associated risk factors. These findings
highlight the need for enhancing surveillance and control efforts and the public 
health education of camel pastoralists. Further investigation to unravel the
zoonotic transmission potential to pastoralists and other animal species is
pertinent.
