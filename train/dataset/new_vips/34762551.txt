TIPiCO is an annual expert meeting and workshop on infectious diseases and
vaccination. The edition of 2020 changed its name and format to aTIPiCO, the
first series and podcasts on infectious diseases and vaccines. A total of 13
prestigious experts from different countries participated in this edition
launched on the 26 November 2020. The state of the art of coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) and the responsible pathogen, the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the options to tackle the
pandemic situation were discussed in light of the knowledge in November 2020.
Despite COVID-19, the status of other infectious diseases, including influenza
infections, respiratory syncytial virus disease, human papillomavirus infection, 
measles, pertussis, tuberculosis, meningococcal disease, and pneumococcal
disease, were also addressed. The essential lessons that can be learned from
these diseases and their vaccines to use in the COVID-19 pandemic were also
commented with the experts.
