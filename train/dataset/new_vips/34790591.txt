Introduction: Recent reports have highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the incidence of infectious disease illnesses and antibiotic use. This study
investigates the effect of the pandemic on childhood incidence of otitis media
(OM) and associated antibiotic prescribing in a large primary care-based cohort
in the Netherlands.
Material and Methods: Retrospective observational cohort study using routine
health care data from the Julius General Practitioners' Network (JGPN). All
children aged 0-12 registered in 62 practices before the COVID-19 pandemic (1
March 2019 - 29 February 2020) and/or during the pandemic (1 March 2020 - 28
February 2021) were included. Data on acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with
effusion (OME), ear discharge episodes and associated antibiotic prescriptions
were extracted. Incidence rates per 1,000 child years (IR), incidence rate ratios
(IRR) and incidence rate differences (IRD) were compared between the two study
periods.
Results: OM episodes declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic: IR
pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19 for AOM 73.7 vs 27.1 [IRR 0.37]; for OME 9.6 vs 4.1 [IRR
0.43]; and for ear discharge 12.6 vs 5.8 [IRR 0.46]. The absolute number of AOM
episodes in which oral antibiotics were prescribed declined accordingly (IRD
pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19: -22.4 per 1,000 child years), but the proportion of AOM
episodes with antibiotic prescription was similar in both periods (47% vs 46%,
respectively).
Discussion: GP consultation for AOM, OME and ear discharge declined by 63%, 57%
and 54% respectively in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar
antibiotic prescription rates before and during the pandemic indicate that the
case-mix presenting to primary care did not considerably change. Our data
therefore suggest a true decline as a consequence of infection control measures
introduced during the pandemic.
