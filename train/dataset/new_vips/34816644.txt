PURPOSE: Considering the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission
through infected droplets, emergency department (ED) operations in response to
febrile patients should be planned. We investigated the general and clinical
characteristics of febrile patients visiting the ED and changes in admission
rates via the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively
collected patients who visited 402 EDs in the Republic of Korea with febrile
symptoms between January 27 and May 31, 2020 and compared them to those enrolled 
before the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary outcome was admission rate; the
secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED.
RESULTS: In total, 266519 patients had febrile symptoms at ED presentation after 
the COVID-19 outbreak. In 2019, before the outbreak, there were 437762 patients. 
The rate of ED visits among pediatric patients (aged <15 years) decreased to
21.4% after the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with 41.8% in 2019. The proportion of
patients admitted after ED management was higher after the outbreak (31.3%) than 
before (25.2%). The adjusted odds ratio for admission was 1.04 (95% confidence
interval: 1.02-1.05) after the outbreak. Compared to before the COVID-19
outbreak, the median ED LOS increased by 16 min after the outbreak.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that admission rates and ED LOS increased for
febrile patients visiting the ED after the COVID-19 outbreak. This could provide 
evidence for developing ED-related strategies in response to the ongoing COVID-19
outbreak and other infectious disease pandemics.
