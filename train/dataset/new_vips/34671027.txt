Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver
disease, worldwide. With the development of direct-acting antivirals, treatment
of chronically infected patients has become highly effective, although a subset
of patients responds less well to therapy. Sofosbuvir is a common component of
current de novo or salvage combination therapies, that targets the HCV NS5B
polymerase. We use pre-treatment whole-genome sequences of HCV from 507 patients 
infected with HCV subtype 3a and treated with sofosbuvir containing regimens to
detect viral polymorphisms associated with response to treatment. We find three
common polymorphisms in non-targeted HCV NS2 and NS3 proteins are associated with
reduced treatment response. These polymorphisms are enriched in post-treatment
HCV sequences of patients unresponsive to treatment. They are also associated
with lower reductions in viral load in the first week of therapy. Using in vitro 
short-term dose-response assays, these polymorphisms do not cause any reduction
in sofosbuvir potency, suggesting an indirect mechanism of action in decreasing
sofosbuvir efficacy. The identification of polymorphisms in NS2 and NS3 proteins 
associated with poor treatment outcomes emphasises the value of systematic
genome-wide analyses of viruses in uncovering clinically relevant polymorphisms
that impact treatment.
