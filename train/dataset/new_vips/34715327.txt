The present study investigated the virulence and expression of innate immunity
genes in isolates of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) in Gangwon
province, South Korea, by challenging rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, and coho
salmon. Eight IHNV isolates were used to infect RTG-2 cells for viral replication
using plaque assays. Three isolates with the highest replication rates, the
RtPc0314g and RtPc0314c isolates of the JRt-Shizuoka type and the RtPc0816g
isolate of the JRt-Nagano type, were experimentally infected into the fish. In
rainbow trout, both RtPc0314c and RtPc0314g isolates showed 100% cumulative
mortality while the RtPc0816g isolate showed 60% cumulative mortality for 14
days. In contrast, all three isolates showed <60% cumulative mortality in
Atlantic salmon and coho salmon. The expression of G genes in the kidney was
higher than that in the spleen-infected fish, with the highest expression
observed in the kidneys of rainbow trout. The relative expression levels of
innate immunity genes were higher in rainbow trout than in Atlantic salmon and
coho salmon. The expression level of immunoglobulin M increased until day 7, and 
the expression of type I interferon was higher in the spleen than in other
tissues. The expression of Mx-1 was higher in the kidney and liver than other
tissues. These results indicate that IHNV isolates from Gangwon province show
host-specific virulence in rainbow trout and that their virulence and replication
were higher in JRt-Shizuoka type than in JRt-Nagano type isolates.
