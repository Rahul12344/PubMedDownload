The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) virus indiscriminately
impacted people worldwide with unquantifiable and severe impacts on all aspects
of our lives, regardless of socioeconomic status. The pandemic brought to light
the very real possibility of pathogens changing and shaping the way we live, and 
our lack of preparedness to deal with viral/bacterial outbreaks. Importantly, the
quick detection of pathogens can help prevent and control the spread of disease, 
making the importance of diagnostic techniques undeniable. Point-of-care
diagnostics started as a supplement to standard lab-based diagnostics, and are
gradually becoming mainstream. Because of this, and their importance in detecting
pathogens (especially in the developing world), their development has accelerated
at an unprecedented rate. In this review, we highlight some important and recent 
examples of point-of-care diagnostics for detecting nucleic acids, proteins,
bacteria, and other biomarkers, with the intent of making apparent their positive
impact on society and human health.
