The assembly and maturation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
require proteolytic cleavage of the Gag polyprotein. The rate-limiting step
resides at the junction between the capsid protein CA and spacer peptide 1, which
assembles as a six-helix bundle (6HB). Bevirimat (BVM), the first-in-class
maturation inhibitor drug, targets the 6HB and impedes proteolytic cleavage, yet 
the molecular mechanisms of its activity, and relatedly, the escape mechanisms of
mutant viruses, remain unclear. Here, we employed extensive molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and free energy calculations to quantitatively investigate
molecular structure-activity relationships, comparing wild-type and mutant
viruses in the presence and absence of BVM and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6),
an assembly cofactor. Our analysis shows that the efficacy of BVM is directly
correlated with preservation of 6-fold symmetry in the 6HB, which exists as an
ensemble of structural states. We identified two primary escape mechanisms, and
both lead to loss of symmetry, thereby facilitating helix uncoiling to aid access
of protease. Our findings also highlight specific interactions that can be
targeted for improved inhibitor activity and support the use of MD simulations
for future inhibitor design.
