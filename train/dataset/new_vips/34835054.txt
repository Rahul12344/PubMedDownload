Extrahepatic manifestations are a feature of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection. In the course of chronic HCV infection, about 70% of patients have one
or more extrahepatic manifestations. The latter are often the first and only
clinical sign of infection. Experimental and clinical data support a causal
association for many extrahepatic manifestations and HCV infection, which include
mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), cardiovascular disease,
insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, neurological and psychiatric disease and
other rheumatic diseases. All these extrahepatic conditions influence the
morbidity, quality of life and mortality of HCV-infected patients. Currently,
interferon-free therapeutic regimens with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA)
offer the possibility of treatment to almost the entire infected population,
irrespective of stage of cirrhosis and associated serious comorbidities, always
maintaining a high efficacy and tolerability. Several studies have shown a close 
association between HCV clearance by DAAs and an improvement or reduction in the 
risk of extrahepatic manifestations. Patients with HCV after a sustained
virologic response (SVR) by DAA treatment have a lower risk than non-responders
of developing cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
Furthermore, the SVR by DAA also reduces the risk of acute coronary syndrome,
cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and it improves
atherosclerosis. HCV clearance by DAA also improves the quality of life and
survival of patients with chronic HCV infection with associated extrahepatic
diseases. Thus, DAAs should be initiated as early as possible in HCV patients
with extrahepatic manifestations.
