Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a human herpes virus that causes significant morbidity
and mortality in immunosuppressed children. CMV primary infection causes a
clinically mild disease in healthy children, usually in early childhood; the
virus then utilises several mechanisms to establish host latency, which allows
for periodic reactivation, particularly when the host is immunocompromised. It is
this reactivation that is responsible for the significant morbidity and mortality
in immunocompromised children. We review CMV infection in the primary
immunodeficient host, including early identification of these infants by newborn 
screening to allow for CMV infection prevention strategies. Furthermore, clinical
CMV is discussed in the context of children treated with secondary
immunodeficiency, particularly paediatric cancer patients and children undergoing
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Treatments for CMV are highlighted
and include CMV immunotherapy.
