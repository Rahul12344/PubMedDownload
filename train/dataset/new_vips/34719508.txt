BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have suggested that decreased expression of
glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is involved in glutamate excitotoxicity and
contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), GLT-1 is decreased in 
animal models of PD. GLT-1 is mainly expressed in astrocytes, and the striatum is
a GLT-1-rich brain area.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to explore the function and mechanism of astrocytic GLT-1 
in PD-like changes.
METHODS: In the study, PD-like changes and their molecular mechanism in rodents
were tested by a behavioral assessment, micro-positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), western blotting, immunohistochemical
and immunofluorescence staining, and high performance liquid chromatography
pre-column derivatization with O-pthaldialdehida after downregulating astrocytic 
GLT-1 in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: In vivo, after 6 weeks of brain stereotactic injection of
adeno-associated virus into the striatum, rats in the astrocytic GLT-1 knockdown 
group showed poorer motor performance, abnormal gait, and depression-like
feature; but no olfactory disorders. The results of micro-PET/CT and western
blotting indicated that the dopaminergic system was impaired in astrocytic GLT-1 
knockdown rats. Similarly, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive immune-staining in 
neurons of astrocytic GLT-1 knockdown rats showed deficit in cell count. In
vitro, knockdown of astrocytic GLT-1 via RNA interference led to morphological
injury of TH-positive neurons, which may be related to the abnormal calcium
signal induced by glutamate accumulation after GLT-1 knockdown. Furthermore, the 
GLT-1 agonist ceftriaxone showed a protective effect on TH-positive neuron
impairment.
CONCLUSION: The present findings may shed new light on the future prevention and 
treatment of PD based on blocking glutamate excitotoxicity.
