The number of sporadic and epidemic dengue fever cases have reportedly been
increasing in recent years in some West African countries, such as Senegal and
Mali. The first epidemic of laboratory-confirmed dengue occurred in Nouakchott,
the capital city of Mauritania situated in the Saharan desert, in 2014. On-site
diagnosis of dengue fever was established using a rapid diagnostic test for
dengue. In parallel, the presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the city was
confirmed. The initial diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR, which showed that all
samples from the 2014 dengue epidemic in Nouakchott were dengue virus serotype 2 
(DENV-2). The whole genome or envelope protein gene of these strains, together
with other DENV-2 strains obtained from travelers returning from West African
countries to France between 2016 and 2019 (including two Mauritanian strains in
2017 and 2018), were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a recent
emergence of an epidemic strain from the cosmopolitan genotype belonging to West 
African cosmopolitan lineage II, which is genetically distinct from African
sylvatic genotype. The origin of this DENV-2 lineage is still unknown, but our
data seem to suggest a recent and rapid dispersion of the epidemic strain
throughout the region. More complete genome sequences of West African DENV-2 are 
required for a better understanding of the dynamics of its circulation. Arboviral
surveillance and outbreak forecasting are urgently needed in West Africa.
