BACKGROUND: Genetic changes may induce dysregulated cytokine production and
affect the progression of the chronic disease caused by the hepacivirus C (HCV)
because the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines determines the
outcome of infection. This study evaluated the TNFA -308G>A and IL10 -1082A>G
polymorphisms in the susceptibility and progress of chronic hepatitis C.
METHOD: The study included 101 samples from patients with chronic hepatitis C and
300 samples from healthy donors. Polymorphisms were typed by real-time PCR and
were analyzed for associations with histopathological parameters (according to
METAVIR classification) and HCV viral load.
RESULTS: The polymorphic genotype for the TNFA -308G>A variant was not present in
the group of patients with chronic hepatitis C and its absence could be
associated with protection against HCV infection (p = 0.0477). Patients with the 
polymorphic genotype of the IL10 -1082A>G polymorphism had higher HCV viral load 
than wild-type patients (p = 0.0428). Neither polymorphism was associated with
different levels of necroinflammatory activity or fibrosis scores.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the polymorphic genotype at TNFA -308G>A as
protective against chronic HCV infection, and the polymorphic genotype at the
IL10 -1082A>G variant associated with higher HCV viral load. Further studies must
be performed in order to confirm these associations.
