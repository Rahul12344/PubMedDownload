Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in pregnant women has an
important role in its spread to the pediatric population through vertical
transmission. Effective utilization of Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission
(PPTCT) services can reduce this spread. This study aims to determine the
vertical transmission of HIV, the seroprevalence of HIV in antenatal women,
demographic factors of seropositive women, and utilization of PPTCT services to
minimize the risk of mother-to-child transmission.
Methods: This study was conducted to assess vertical transmission of HIV in the
newborn of HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) of a tertiary care
hospital from August 2014 to December 2020. Pretest counseling, HIV testing, and 
posttest counseling were done as per National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)
guidelines. Antiretroviral prophylaxis was given to seropositive women and their 
children. Analysis of demographic data of seropositive women and assessment of
the utilization of PPTCT services were done according to available records.
Results: In the study time, 139,619 new antenatal registrations were there,
68.21% of women attended pretest counseling and of them, 95.28% gave consent for 
HIV testing. Out of which, 0.14% were reported as HIV seropositive in PPTCT
(tested according to NACO guidelines). In the study time, a total of 188
HIV-positive deliveries were conducted in our institute. Out of which, 144
(76.6%) were ANC-booked patients and 44 (23.4%) were unbooked patients and
directly came in labor, deliveries were conducted according to NACO guidelines
and all newborns were given nevirapine syrup. All newborns were followed up until
18 months and in study time, 78 dry blood samples (DBSs) were sent for DNA
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and all were reported negative by the
reference laboratory at AIIMS, New Delhi.
Conclusions: Adherence to testing, treatment, and follow-up in the antenatal and 
postnatal period can minimize the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child.
