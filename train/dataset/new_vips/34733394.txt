Introduction: the COVID-19 pandemic since its emergence has posed a great danger 
to the health of the general populace while impacting the Nigerian healthcare
delivery significantly. Since its emergence, the health system has been stretched
with overwhelming responsibilities. The study assessed health providers´
perceived impact of coronavirus pandemic on the uptake of health care services in
South West Nigeria.
Methods: a descriptive cross-sectional design using an online structured survey
was used to elicit responses from 385 Nigerian health workers selected by
convenience sampling technique. Data analysis was done with the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. Comparison of the uptake of
healthcare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed using the
Chi-square test.
Results: findings revealed a significant difference between the uptake of health 
care prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic (χ2= 92.77, p=0.000) as 253
respondents (65.7%) reported that the hospital recorded a low turn-out of
patients during the pandemic and 184 (47.8%) indicated that some of the facility 
units/departments were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly,
there was a significant difference between health-related conditions requiring
hospital admission before and during COVID-19 pandemic (χ2=3.334 p=0.046).
Factors influencing uptake of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic are:
fear of nosocomial infection, fear of stigmatization, and
misconception/misinformation on COVID-19 diseases and care.
Conclusion: the Nigerian health system in the past months has been remarkably
impacted by the pandemic. This calls for immediate restructuring to maintain an
equitable distribution of care, while minimizing risk to patients and health
providers.
