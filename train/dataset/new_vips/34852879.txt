The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought a number of major global clinical,
sociological and economic issues into sharp focus. We address some of these
issues, focusing on short-term factors such as virus mutations and vaccine
efficacy, and also considering the longer-term implications of the current
pandemic. We discuss societal responses to the presence of a pathogen that will
probably remain in circulation for decades or longer, and to future new emergent 
viruses.
