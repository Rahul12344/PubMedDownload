The COVID-19 pandemic, which has ravaged the world, has led to a rethinking of
the relationship between humans and nature and the clichés of the
economic-centered model. Thus, the ecological economy has been reviewed,
especially from an ethical worldview. This paper uses statistical methods to
retrieve and categorize 3,646 wildlife crime cases for analysis and quantitative 
research. It adopts legal and ethical perspectives to analyze the subject and the
subjective, incidence, and sentencing factors of wildlife crimes and uses the
ecological economic ethical model to measure wildlife crimes. We argue that the
existing judicial system fails to answer the difficulties of the economic ethics 
of wildlife crimes. It is recommended that ecological and economic ethical
awareness be internalized. We suggest calling for comprehensive legislation on
wildlife crimes from the perspective of ecological economic ethics to effectively
prevent and reduce wildlife crime and eventually promote public health.
