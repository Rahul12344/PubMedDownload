INTRODUCTION: in the review, we aimed to present current knowledge about the risk
of infection, standards of care, and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in pediatric 
patients after non-vertical exposures to HIV, HBV, and HCV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: the latest available literature and recommendations of
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization
(WHO), European recommendations for the management of HIV and administration of
non-occupational PEP, and Polish AIDS Society were reviewed.
RESULTS: the majority of cases of non-vertical exposure to blood-borne viruses in
the pediatric population consist of sexual exposition and injection with
unsterilized sharp objects (usually needlestick injuries). The risk HIV, HBV, and
HCV transmission depend on several factors, and each exposure should be evaluated
individually with consideration of the patient's medical history. It is crucial
to start antiretroviral therapy within 48 h from exposure. Treatment is continued
for 28 days, and a 3-drugs regiment is recommended in the majority of cases.
Decisions on hepatitis B and tetanus PEP are based on a history of vaccination.
There is no PEP for hepatitis C infection, follow-up testing aims for early
identification of disease and consideration of treatment options.
CONCLUSION: all children after the non-vertical exposure to HIV, HBV, and HCV
infection should be evaluated by the Infectious Disease specialist as soon as
possible after the incident and qualified to post-exposure prophylaxis.
Systematic diagnostic and follow-up on children after significant needlestick
exposure should be maintained. Children after sexual exposure need a
multidisciplinary approach. Response to reported event must be rapid and
treatment must be comprehensive.
