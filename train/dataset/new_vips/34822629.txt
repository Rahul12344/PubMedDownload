The definition "porcine respiratory disease complex" (PRDC) is used to indicate
the current approach for presenting respiratory pathology in modern pig farming. 
PRDC includes pneumonias with variable pictures, mixed with both aerogenous and
hematogenous forms with variable etiology, often multimicrobial, and influenced
by environmental and management factors. The notion that many etiological agents 
of swine respiratory pathology are ubiquitous in the airways is commonly
understood; however, their isolation or identification is not always associable
with the current pathology. In this complex context, lung lesions registered at
slaughterhouse or during necropsy, and supplemented by histological
investigations, must be considered as powerful tools for assigning a prominent
role to etiologic agents. In recent years, the goal of colocalizing causative
agents with the lesions they produce has been frequently applied, and valid
examples in routine diagnostics are those that indicate pulmonary involvement
during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine
circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections.
