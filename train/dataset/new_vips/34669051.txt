Abortive infections are a major health challenge affecting productive and
reproductive performance of sheep and goats. However, there is no comprehensive
summary on the occurrence and distribution of these infections in Algeria. This
systematic review provides a comprehensive summary on the prevalence of different
abortive diseases and assesses potential risk factors in small ruminants in
Algeria. Five databases were used to search epidemiological data on the
prevalence of different abortive diseases (bacterial, parasitic, and viral). Data
were collected from 25 papers published between 2003 and 2020. The total mean
sample size was 53,080 small ruminants. The majority of the diseases/infections
were diagnosed by serological and molecular tests. The overall prevalence of
brucellosis was 0.39% in sheep and 5.31% in goats. Chlamydia and Q fever were
observed in 32.72% and 20.62% of small ruminants, respectively. The prevalence of
peste des petits ruminants was 15.76% and the overall prevalence of bluetongue in
sheep and goats was, respectively, 13.41% and 44.50%. Border disease and bovine
viral diarrhea were detected in 22.68% and 1.01% of sheep examined, respectively.
Toxoplasma gondii infection prevalence among sheep and goats was 21.43% and
32.31% respectively. This study is a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of
abortion diseases in small ruminants in Algeria and will therefore be a useful
tool for researchers. Larger and more robust prevalence studies are needed to
adequately support risk assessment and management of animal and public health
threats.
