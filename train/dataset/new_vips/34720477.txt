Pandemic and the state.

It has been argued the pandemic has brought back the state. The discussions on
this return of the state have been concentrated, so far, around familiar themes: 
trade-off between freedom-privacy and security with the expansion of control and 
surveillance of our bodies by the state, efficiency-competency of the state in
containing the spread of the virus, and exclusion of marginalised peoples from
healthcare facilities and sacrifice of older people in the process of rational
allocation of critical care. In this short essay, I will explore and engage with 
these debates, and enquire what the pandemic control measures and outcomes tell
us about present nature of the Indian state.
