RNA molecules are key players in a variety of biological events, and this is
particularly true for viral RNAs. To better understand the replication of those
pathogens and try to block them, special attention has been paid to the structure
of their RNAs. Methods to probe RNA structures have been developed since the
1960s; even if they have evolved over the years, they are still in use today and 
provide useful information on the folding of RNA molecules, including viral RNAs.
The aim of this review is to offer a historical perspective on the structural
probing methods used to decipher RNA structures before the development of the
selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) methodology 
and to show how they have influenced the current probing techniques. Actually,
these technological breakthroughs, which involved advanced detection methods,
were made possible thanks to the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
but also to the previous works accumulated in the field of structural RNA
biology. Finally, we will also discuss how high-throughput SHAPE (hSHAPE) paved
the way for the development of sophisticated RNA structural techniques.
