The non-canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) signaling pathway is an important component of NF-κB transcription
complex. Activation of this pathway mediates the development and function of host
immune system involved in inflammation and viral infection. During hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection, there is a complex interaction between infected
hepatocytes and the immune cells, which can hinder antiviral immune responses and
is associated with pathological changes in liver tissue. Consistently, the host
immune system is closely related to the severity of liver damage and the level of
viral replication. Previous studies indicated that the non-canonical NF-κB
signaling pathway was affected by HBV and might play an important regulatory role
in the antiviral immunity. Therefore, systematically elucidating the interplay
between HBV and non-canonical NF-κB signaling will contribute the discovery of
more potential therapeutic targets and novel drugs to treat HBV infection.
