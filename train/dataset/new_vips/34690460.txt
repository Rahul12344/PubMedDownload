Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic swiftly affected the world in a very short
duration, and the orthopaedic surgery practice is no exception. Unprecedented
lockdown was enforced in many countries including India as a first response to
contain virus and its spread. That lead to a lot of confusion, fear, anxiety
among general population as well as orthopaedic surgeons. We have studied the
impact of this pandemic with fear as a denominator and how it affected the
practice and health of orthopaedic surgeons.
Methods: Cross-sectional web-based national survey distributed to orthopaedic
surgeons by social media platform over period of one month from July 25, 2020 to 
August 25, 2020.
Results: Among 1065 responders, 731 completed the survey. Among 1065 responders, 
27.22% had orthopaedic practice experience ranging from 10 to 20 years while
21.48% had orthopaedic experience more than 20 years. Scientific literature as
well as social media and news media contributed significantly to Covid-19
knowledge and fear. 98.88% were worried about contracting disease by themselves
or by family members. 89.47% were worried due to financial loss due to pandemic. 
37 (5.06%) surgeons had a FCV- 19 scale (Fear for Covid-19 scale) score more than
60 (8.2%) while 291 (39.8%) had 41-60 and score was <40 in 403 (55.12%) surgeons.
According to survey vaccine availability and emergence of effective drug and
treatment protocol will alleviate most of the concerns. 70.81% felt mildly
depressed during pandemic times while 65.33% surgeons expressed interest in
joining discussion groups and meetings encouraging positive thoughts.
Conclusion: Financial liabilities and well-being of self and family are important
factors which induced fear of Covid-19 among orthopaedic surgeons. Positive
discussions and timely information from credible sources regarding prevention,
diagnosis and management and will reduce psychological burden due to Covid-19,
also this will help to form policies for future pandemics.
