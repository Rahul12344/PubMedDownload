Infectious pandemics result in hundreds and millions of deaths, notable examples 
of the Spanish Flu, the Black Death and smallpox. The current pandemic, caused by
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), is unprecedented
even in the historical term of pandemics. The unprecedentedness is featured by
multiple surges, rapid identification of therapeutic options and accelerated
development of vaccines. Remdesivir, originally developed for Ebola viral
disease, is the first treatment of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) approved
by the United States Food and Drug Administration. As demonstrated by in vitro
and preclinical studies, this therapeutic agent is highly potent with a broad
spectrum activity against viruses from as many as seven families even cross
species. However, randomized controlled trials have failed to confirm the
efficacy and safety. Remdesivir improves some clinical signs but not critical
parameters such as mortality. This antiviral agent is an ester/phosphorylation
prodrug and excessive hydrolysis which increases cellular toxicity. Remdesivir is
given intravenously, leading to concentration spikes and likely increasing the
potential of hydrolysis-based toxicity. This review has proposed a conceptual
framework for improving its efficacy and minimizing toxicity not only for the
COVID-19 pandemic but also for future ones caused by remdesivir-sensitive
viruses.
