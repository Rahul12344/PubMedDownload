PURPOSE: Neurosyphilis can mimic different diseases, not only in its clinical
presentation but also on imaging. Treponema pallidum is also known as the "great 
imitator." Having an ultimate diagnosis of neurosyphilis is quite critical as
this can affect management drastically. Herein, we discuss the case of a
69-year-old female who was treated for neurosyphilis, while having an atypical
imaging finding of anterior temporal lobe enhancement that simulated an infection
with herpes simplex virus (HSV); we also review the available literature on
different imaging findings in both the early and late stages of the disease.
METHODS: We performed a literature search using the new PubMed in June 2021. The 
terms "neurosyphilis", "MRI", and "neuroimaging" were used either alone or in
combination with "early neurosyphilis" or "late neurosyphilis". Data on
neurosyphilis and imaging findings was mainly derived from review articles,
cohort studies, case series, and individual reports.
CONCLUSION: Neurosyphilis can present with an extensive variation and different
patterns on the MRI, and clinicians must be aware of the wide variety in
radiological presentations. Anterior temporal lobe involvement is a rare
presentation and requires evaluating for neurosyphilis to prevent a missed
diagnosis and treatment.
