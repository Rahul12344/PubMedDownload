Shuni virus is associated with neurologic and febrile illness in animals and
humans. To determine potential vectors, we collected mosquitoes in South Africa
and detected the virus in species of the genera Mansonia, Culex, Aedes, and
Anopheles. These mosquitoes may be associated with Shuni virus outbreaks in
Africa and emergence in other regions.
