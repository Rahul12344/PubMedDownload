The long-term impact of the COVID-19 infection on mental health in people and its
relation to the severity is unclear. We aimed to study the long-term effect of
post-COVID-19 disease on sleep and mental health and to detect possible
relationship between severity of COVID-19 at onset and sleep and mental illness. 
We enrolled 182 participants 6 months post COVID-19 infection and grouped into
non-severe(101),severe(60) and critical(20) according to according to WHO
guidance. All participants were assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ", 
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5, and Symptom
Checklist90 test. Only 8.8% had no psychiatric symptoms while 91.2% had
psychiatric symptoms as follow (poor sleep (64.8%), PTSD (28.6%), somatization
(41.8%), obsessive-compulsive (OCD) (19.8%), depression (11.5%), anxiety (28%),
phobic-anxiety (24.2%), psychoticism (17.6%)). Diabetes, oxygen support or
mechanically ventilated were a risk for sleep impairment, while high
Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio(NLR) was the only risk factor for PTSD. Other
psychiatric illnesses had several risk factors: being female, diabetes, oxygen
support or mechanically ventilated. Abnormal sleep, somatization and anxiety are 
the most common mental illnesses in Post-Covid19. The critical group is common
associated with PTSD, anxiety, and psychosis. Being female, diabetic, having
oxygen support or mechanically ventilated, and high NLR level are more vulnerable
for mental illness in post COVID19.
