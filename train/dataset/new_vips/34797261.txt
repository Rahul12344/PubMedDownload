The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted life across the world and
amplified inequities experienced by communities of color within the United
States. Washington County was the first jurisdiction in the state of Oregon to
have a confirmed COVID-19 case. To center equity within the County Emergency
Operations Center (EOC), new positions were created within the EOC including an
Equity Officer and an Equity Technical Advisor position, an Equity Team, and a
Language Access Coordinator. This team engaged stakeholders and community
partners in addition to developing an equity framework to guide decision making
within the EOC. Implementation of the framework resulted in better identification
of urgent community needs, especially for groups most impacted by inequities.
This integration also supports government leaders and communities in creating
programs, policies, and procedures to equitably address community needs.
