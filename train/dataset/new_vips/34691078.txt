The recent identification and rise to dominance of the P.1 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2
variants have brought international concern because they may confer fitness
advantages. The same three positions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are
affected in both variants, but where the 417 substitution differs, the
E484K/N501Y have co-evolved by convergent evolution. Here we characterize the
functional and immune evasive consequences of the P.1 and B.1.351 RBD mutations. 
E484K and N501Y result in gain-of-function with two different outcomes: The N501Y
confers a ten-fold affinity increase towards ACE-2, but a modest antibody evasion
potential of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals, whereas the
E484K displays a significant antibody evasion capacity without a major impact on 
affinity. On the other hand, the two different 417 substitutions severely impair 
the RBD/ACE-2 affinity, but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants, this
effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y. Our
results suggest that the combination of these three mutations is a two-step
forward and one step back in terms of viral fitness.
