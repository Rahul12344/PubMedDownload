INTRODUCTION: Digital immunoassays are generally regarded as superior tests for
the detection of infectious disease pathogens, but there have been insufficient
data concerning SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a novel digital immunoassay (RapidTesta
SARS-CoV-2). Two nasopharyngeal samples were simultaneously collected for antigen
tests and Real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: During the study period, 1127 nasopharyngeal samples (symptomatic
patients: 802, asymptomatic patients: 325) were evaluated. For digital
immunoassay antigen tests, the sensitivity was 78.3% (95% CI: 67.3%-87.1%) and
the specificity was 97.6% (95% CI: 96.5%-98.5%). When technicians visually
analyzed the antigen test results, the sensitivity was 71.6% (95% CI:
59.9%-81.5%) and the specificity was 99.2% (95% CI: 98.5%-99.7%). Among
symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 89.4% (95% CI; 76.9%-96.5%) with
digital immunoassay antigen tests, and 85.1% (95% CI; 71.7%-93.8%) with visually 
analyzed the antigen test, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of digital immunoassay antigen tests was superior to
that of visually analyzed antigen tests, but the rate of false-positive results
increased with the introduction of a digital immunoassay device.
