COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Health.

Berglund J.

In late February 2020, a time when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) still felt like an abstraction in the United States, 
New York City's first infected patient was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital's
emergency room. Working a few doors down was Sean Pinney, the Director of
Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation. Little did he know, but "that night
was the beginning of hell," he said.
