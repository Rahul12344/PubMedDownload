Tissue pathogens are commonly encountered in histopathology and cytology
practice, where they can present as either benign mimickers of malignancy or true
malignancies. The aim of this review is to provide a timely synthesis of our
understanding of these tissue pathogens, with an emphasis on pertinent diagnostic
conundrums associated with the benign mimickers of malignancy that can be seen
with viral infections and those which manifest as granulomas. The oncogenic
pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, are then discussed with
relationship to their associated malignancies. Although not exhaustive, the
epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and histological findings
are included, along with a short review of emerging therapies.
