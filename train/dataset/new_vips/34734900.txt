BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that affects many
organs, especially the lung, and may lead to multiorgan failure. Studies
describing neurological dysfunctions involving the central and peripheral nervous
systems have emerged. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the neurological signs
and symptoms in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: The data of 290 patients admitted to our center (ward and intensive care
unit) who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively.
Patients' demographic, clinical and laboratory data, and their neurological
diseases, symptoms, and complications were compared.
RESULTS: Male sex, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
having a history of neurological disease were associated with increased mortality
in patients with COVID-19. Seizures and altered consciousness were also found to 
be more common in patients who died. In addition, lower platelet counts
(P=0.001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P<0.001) and higher D-dimer levels
(P=0.003) were associated with increased risk of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that close monitoring of any possible neurological
manifestations is mandatory in hospitalized patients at the onset of COVID-19 and
during disease progression. Clinical findings such as neurological symptoms and
acute phase reactants are important in the follow-up and treatment of the
disease.
