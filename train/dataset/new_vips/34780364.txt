INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate clinical and laboratory findings of
hospitalized asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients
with COVID-19 and demonstrate that they have different symptoms and/or laboratory
results and outcomes than COVID-19 patients with comorbidity (CoV-com) and
without comorbidity (CoV-alone).
METHODOLOGY: The data of the demographic, clinical, laboratory findings of
hospitalized CoV-alone, asthma, COPD patients with COVID-19 (CoV-asthma,
CoV-COPD, respectively), and CoV-com were analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 1082 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 585 (54.1%) had
CoV-alone, 40 (3.7%) had CoV-asthma, 46 (4.3%) had CoV-COPD and 411 (38%) had
CoV-com. Cough, shortness of breath, fever and weakness were the most common four
symptoms seen in all COVID-19 patients. Shortness of breath, myalgia, headache
symptoms were more common in CoV-asthma than the other groups (p < 0.001, p <
0.01, p < 0.05 respectively). Sputum was more common in CoV-COPD than other
groups (p < 0.01). COPD group most frequently had increased values, different
from the other groups with CRP>5ng/mL in 91.3%, D-dimer > 0.05mg/dL in 89.1%,
troponin > 0.014micg/L in %63.9, INR>1.15 in 52.2%, CK-MB>25U/L in 48.5%, PT>14s 
in 40.9% of patients (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p <
0.001, respectively). NT-ProBNP was found to have the highest AUC value and the
best differentiating parameter for CoV-asthma from CoV-alone. Typical CT findings
were present in 44.4% of CoV-alone, 57.5% of CoV-asthma, 28.3% of CoV-COPD and
38.9% of CoV-com groups. CoV-COPD and CoV-com patients died more frequently than 
other groups (17.8%, 18.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: CoV-asthma and CoV-COPD patients might have different symptoms and
laboratory parameters than other COVID-19 patients which can guide the
physicians.
