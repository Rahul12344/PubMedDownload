Animal health issues are important for farming community in agriculture. Small
ruminant populations such as goats and sheep often get affected with contagious
diseases. Peste des petits ruminants caused by a virus which need to be detected 
quickly to isolate affected animals and stop the spread of disease. The H protein
of Peste des petits ruminants virus has sialic acid specific receptor, therefore 
sialic acid reduce and stabilized gold-nanoparticles were synthesize by a simple 
one pot method and without chemically modifying the sialic acid. The gold
nanoparticles showed targetspecific aggregation with viral particles via
hemagglutinin-sialic acid binding. The PPR virus was readily detected at the
dilution of 10-6 by sialic acid-AuNPs. While comparing with the standard
monoclonal antibody based test used for the detection of Peste des petits
ruminants virus, sialic acid-AuNPs gave detection faster in less than 2 minute.
