Rapid Cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 Assay in Comparison with the Laboratory-Developed
Real-Time RT-PCR Test.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the validity of two
different assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We collected 50 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from 
the emergency department of Asia University Hospital for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The
samples for the Liat SARS-CoV-2 influenza A/B test were stored at -70℃ after
SARS-CoV-2 testing using the RT-PCR in order to assess method comparison.
RESULTS: In this study, the Limit of detection (LOD) of the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2
and influenza A/B nucleic acid test is 12 copies/µL and the assay obtained 100%
positive agreement and negative percent agreement with RT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a prefect agreement exists between the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 conducted with the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic
acid test and the RT-PCR. The cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic
acid test is a reliable method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and it only
requires 20 minutes to obtain the results. On the other hand, the cobas Liat
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid test is accurate, easy to use, and
provides a faster turnaround time than testing performed in the high-throughput
platform.
