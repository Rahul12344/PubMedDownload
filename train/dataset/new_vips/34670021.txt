The safety of novel therapeutics and vaccines are typically assessed in early
phase clinical trials involving "healthy volunteers." Abnormalities in such
individuals can be difficult to interpret and may indicate previously
unrecognized medical conditions. The frequency of incidental findings (IFs) in
healthy volunteers who attend for clinical trial screening is unclear. To assess 
this, we retrospectively analyzed data for 1838 "healthy volunteers" screened for
enrolment in a UK multicenter, phase I/II severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) vaccine trial. Participants were
predominantly White (89.7%, 1640/1828) with a median age of 34 years
(interquartile range [IQR] = 27-44). There were 27.7% of participants (510/1838) 
who had at least one IF detected. The likelihood of identifying evidence of a
potential, new blood-borne virus infection was low (1 in 238 participants)
compared with identification of an elevated alanine transaminase (ALT; 1 in 17
participants). A large proportion of participants described social habits that
could impact negatively on their health; 21% consumed alcohol in excess, 10% were
current smokers, 11% described recreational drug use, and only 48% had body
weight in the ideal range. Our data demonstrate that screening prior to
enrollment in early phase clinical trials identifies a range of IFs, which should
inform discussion during the consent process. Greater clarity is needed to ensure
an appropriate balance is struck between early identification of medical problems
and avoidance of exclusion of volunteers due to spurious or physiological
abnormalities. Debate should inform the role of the trial physician in
highlighting and advising about unhealthy social habits.
