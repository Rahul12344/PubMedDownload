Plenty of research has revealed virus induced alternations in metabolic pathways,
which is known as metabolic reprogramming. Studies focusing on COVID-19 have
uncovered significant changes in metabolism, resulting in the perspective that
COVID-19 is a metabolic disease. Reprogramming of amino acid, glucose,
cholesterol and fatty acid is distinctive characteristic of COVID-19 infection.
These metabolic changes in COVID-19 have a critical role not only in producing
energy and virus constituent elements, but also in regulating immune response,
offering new insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology. Remarkably, metabolic
reprogramming provides great opportunities for developing novel biomarkers and
therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infection. Such novel agents are expected to be
effective adjuvant therapies. In this review, we integrate present studies about 
major metabolic reprogramming in COVID-19, as well as the possibility of
targeting reprogrammed metabolism to combat virus infection.
