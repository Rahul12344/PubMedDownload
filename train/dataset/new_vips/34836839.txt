BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged health systems globally. A key
controversy has been how to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) using personal
protective equipment (PPE).
METHODS: Interviews were performed with 63 HCWs across two states in Australia to
explore their experiences of PPE during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Thematic
analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Four themes were identified with respect to HCWs' experience of pandemic
PPE: 1. Risk, fear and uncertainty: HCWs experienced considerable fear and
heightened personal and professional risk, reporting anxiety about the adequacy
of PPE and the resultant risk to themselves and their families. 2. Evidence and
the ambiguities of evolving guidelines: forms of evidence, its interpretation,
and the perception of rapidly changing guidelines heightened distress amongst
HCWs. 3. Trust and care: Access to PPE signified organisational support and care,
and restrictions on PPE use were considered a breach of trust. 4. Non-compliant
practice in the context of social upheaval: despite communication of
evidence-based guidelines, an environment of mistrust, personal risk, and
organisational uncertainty resulted in variable compliance.
CONCLUSION: PPE preferences and usage offer a material signifier of the broader, 
evolving pandemic context, reflecting HCWs' fear, mistrust, sense of inequity and
social solidarity (or breakdown). PPE therefore represents the affective
(emotional) demands of professional care, as well as a technical challenge of
infection prevention and control. If rationing of PPE is necessary, policymakers 
need to take account of how HCWs will perceive restrictions or conflicting
recommendations and build trust through effective communication (including of
uncertainty).
