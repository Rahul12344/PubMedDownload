Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a
common dis-ease in cats, fatal if untreated, and no effective treatment is
currently legally available. The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and
toxicity of the multi-component drug Xraphconn速 in vitro and as oral treatment in
cats with spontaneous FIP by examining survival rate, development of clinical and
laboratory parameters, viral loads, anti-FCoV antibodies, and adverse effects.
Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance identified GS-441524 as an
active component of Xraphconn速. Eighteen cats with FIP were prospectively
followed up while being treated orally for 84 days. Values of key parameters on
each examination day were compared to values before treatment initiation using
linear mixed-effect models. Xraphconn速 displayed high virucidal activity in cell 
culture. All cats recovered with dramatic improvement of clinical and laboratory 
parameters and massive reduction in viral loads within the first few days of
treatment without serious adverse effects. Oral treatment with Xraphconn速
containing GS-441524 was highly effective for FIP without causing serious adverse
effects. This drug is an excellent option for the oral treatment of FIP and
should be trialed as potential effective treatment option for other severe
coronavirus-associated diseases across species.
