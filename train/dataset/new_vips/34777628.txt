The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly spread worldwide. Developing
methods to identify the therapeutic activity of drugs based on phenotypic data
can improve the efficiency of drug development. Here, a state-of-the-art
machine-learning method was used to identify drug mechanism of actions (MoAs)
based on the cell image features of 1105 drugs in the  LINCS database. As the
multi-dimensional features of cell images are affected by non-experimental
factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary considerably, and it is
difficult to effectively identify the MoA of drugs as there is substantial noise.
By applying the supervised information theoretic metric-learning (ITML)
algorithm, a linear transformation made drugs with the same MoA aggregate. By
clustering drugs to communities and performing enrichment analysis, we found that
transferred image features were more conducive to the recognition of drug MoAs.
Image features analysis showed that different features play important roles in
identifying different drug functions. Drugs that significantly affect cell
survival or proliferation, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, were more 
likely to be enriched in communities, whereas other drugs might be decentralized.
Chloroquine and clomiphene, which block the entry of virus, were clustered into
the same community, indicating that similar MoA could be reflected by the cell
image. Overall, the findings of the present study laid the foundation for the
discovery of MoAs of new drugs, based on image data. In addition, it provided a
new method of drug repurposing for COVID-19.Supplementary Information: The online
