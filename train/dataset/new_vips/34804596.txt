Hemodialysis is a medical procedure to correct electrolyte imbalance and remove
fluids and waste products from the blood of patients with end-stage renal
disease. Dialysis patients are immunosuppressed and hence at risk of
complications of coronavirus infection. In addition, dialysis for most patients
is performed in-center, with therapy offered three times per week for 3.5 hours
per session in sites highly exposed to virus contamination. A weak immune system 
and low cytokine storm explain why COVID-19 may be less severe in dialysis
patients as death due to COVID-19 or effects on comorbidities in COVID-19
patients is due to overresponse against the virus by the immune system and
cytokine storm. However, during the frequent trips between the dialysis center
and home, the risk of coronavirus infection could be high. Moreover, hemodialysis
patients constitute a distinct and high-risk group that is often associated with 
low immunity, decline or loss of the ability to work, substantial economic
burden, the inability to fulfill family responsibilities and participate in an
active social life, and suffer from various complications such as muscle
weakness, pruritus, fatigue, diabetes, hypertension, and restless legs. These
factors are associated with lower quality of life and poor clinical outcomes,
leading to a higher risk of psychological problems than in the general
population. We report a rare case of new-onset psychosis (mostly delirium)
following COVID-19 infection in a middle-aged hemodialysis patient with rapid
recovery.
