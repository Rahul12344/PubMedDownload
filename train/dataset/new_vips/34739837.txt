BACKGROUND: Early detection of acute HIV infection by HIV antigen/antibody assays
depends on antigen sensitivity. Maintaining consistently high sensitivity across 
diverse HIV strains is critical to ensure equal detection.
OBJECTIVES: The performance of an improved HIV antigen/antibody prototype, HIV
Combo Next, was evaluated for detection of genetically-diverse HIV strains and
seroconversion samples.
STUDY DESIGN: Antigen sensitivity of the prototype was evaluated and compared to 
five FDA-approved HIV antigen/antibody assays using World Health Organization
(WHO) HIV p24 antigen standard and reference panels, 17 virus isolates and 9
seroconversion panels. Antibody sensitivity and assay specificity of the
prototype were also assessed with 1062 disease-staged and genotyped samples, and 
samples from 3000 blood donors and 955 individuals with low-risk for HIV
infection.
RESULTS: Compared with other assays evaluated, the prototype demonstrated the
best analytical sensitivity for WHO antigen standard, reference panels including 
12 HIV-1 variants (0.04 - 0.25 IU/ml) and one HIV-2 variant, and 17 HIV virus
isolates including HIV-1 group M, N, P and O and HIV-2 (0.3 -16 pg/ml). The
enhanced sensitivity was also observed for seroconversion samples, detecting more
PCR-positive samples with detection up to 7 days earlier than the other assays.
Improvement in antigen sensitivity did not compromise antibody sensitivity or
assay specificity, detecting all HIV disease-staged and genotyped samples, with
assay specificity of 99.97% for blood donors and 99.68% for the low-risk
population.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the new prototype HIV Combo Next assay will
be of diagnostic value, providing improved early detection for acute HIV
infection from divergent HIV strains.
