BACKGROUND: Lianhuaqingke (LHQK) has been approved for the treatment of acute
tracheobronchitis and exerts a broad-spectrum antiviral effect in our previous
study.
METHODS: Acute pneumonia caused by HCoV-229E was modeled in BALB/c mice. The
anti-viral effect of LHQK was assessed by measuring the lung index and virus
titer of lung tissues. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
lung tissues and peripheral blood were measured by ELISA. The morphological
changes of lung tissues were observed by H&E staining. The subsets of Th cells
were assayed by the flow cytometry, including Th0, Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17. The 
expression level of MUC5AC in 16HBE cells treated with TNFα was measured by
ELISA. Immunofluorescence staining for β-IV tubulin was used to identify the
airway epithelial ciliary in the condition-cultured RTE cells treated with TNFα. 
The direct antiviral effect of LHQK was assessed in vitro in Vero E6 infected by 
SARS-CoV-2, validated in vivo in the COVID-19 model of hACE2 transgenic mouse by 
detecting the lung index, the SARS-CoV-2 virus load, and the morphological
changes of lung tissues.
RESULTS: LHQK reduced the weight loss and the lung index by inhibiting the
HCoV-229E replication and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
in lung tissues. An assay for the Th cell subsets in peripheral blood revealed
that LHQK could reduce the ratio of Th1/Th2 and increase the Treg/Th17 ratio in a
dose-dependent way, which indicated that LHQK could coordinate the Th-mediated
immune responses against the virus. In in vitro injury by TNFα, LHQK inhibited
MUC5AC expression in 16HBE cells and increased the number of β-IV tubulin
positive staining cells in the condition-cultured RTE cells. In the
SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, LHQK could reduce weight loss, inhibit viral
replication, and alleviate lung tissue damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that LHQK exerts therapeutic effects on
pneumonia caused by HCoVs (HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2) in mice, and that the
anti-HCoV effects might depend on its immunomodulatory capacities. All these
results suggest that LHQK serves as a potential adjuvant for anti-HCoV therapies.
