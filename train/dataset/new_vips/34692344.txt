As we move amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we have
witnessed tremendous distress, death, and turmoil of everyday life for more than 
one year now. However, they are not modern phenomena; deadly pandemics have
happened throughout recorded history. Pandemics such as the plague, Spanish Flu, 
HIV, and Ebola caused deaths, destruction of political regimes, as well as
financial and psychosocial burdens. However, they sometimes resulted in
scientific discoveries. Understanding the mechanism of the emergence of these
pandemics is crucial to control any spreading pandemic and prevent the emergence 
of a potential new one. Public health agencies need to work on improving the
countries' pandemic preparedness to prevent any future pandemics. The review
article aims to shed light on some of the deadliest pandemics throughout history,
information of critical importance for clinicians and researchers.
