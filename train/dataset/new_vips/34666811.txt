BACKGROUND: Thromboembolism has been reported as a consequence of severe
COVID-19. Although warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant, it acts by
antagonising vitamin K, which is low in patients with severe COVID-19. To date,
the clinical evidence on the impact of regular use of warfarin on
COVID-19-related thromboembolism is lacking.
METHODS: On behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study
investigating the association between warfarin and COVID-19 outcomes compared
with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We used the OpenSAFELY platform to
analyse primary care data and pseudonymously linked SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing
data, hospital admissions and death records from England. We used Cox regression 
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19-related outcomes comparing warfarin 
with DOACs in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. We also conducted
negative control outcome analyses (being tested for SARS-CoV-2 and non-COVID-19
death) to assess the potential impact of confounding.
RESULTS: A total of 92,339 warfarin users and 280,407 DOAC users were included.
We observed a lower risk of all outcomes associated with warfarin versus DOACs
[testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.68-0.79); COVID-19-related
hospital admission, HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.83); COVID-19-related deaths, HR 0.74 
(95% CI 0.66-0.83)]. A lower risk of negative control outcomes associated with
warfarin versus DOACs was also observed [being tested for SARS-CoV-2, HR 0.80
(95% CI 0.79-0.81); non-COVID-19 deaths, HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.76-0.83)].
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study shows no evidence of harmful effects of warfarin
on severe COVID-19 disease.
