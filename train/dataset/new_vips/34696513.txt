A real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is considered the gold standard for 
the laboratory diagnosis of canine parvovirus (CPV) infection but can only be
performed in specialized laboratories. Several point-of-care tests (POCT),
detecting CPV antigens in faeces within minutes, are commercially available. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate eight POCT in comparison with qPCR. Faecal
samples of 150 dogs from three groups (H: 50 client-owned, healthy dogs, not
vaccinated within the last four weeks; S: 50 shelter dogs, healthy, not
vaccinated within the last four weeks; p = 50 dogs with clinical signs of CPV
infection) were tested with eight POCT and qPCR. Practicability, sensitivity,
specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), as well as
overall accuracy were determined. To assess the differences between and agreement
among POCT, McNemar's test and Cohen's Kappa statistic were performed.
Specificity and PPV were 100.0% in all POCT. Sensitivity varied from 22.9-34.3%
overall and from 32.7-49.0% in group P. VetexpertRapidTestCPVAg® had the highest 
sensitivity (34.3% overall, 49.0% group P) and differed significantly from the 3 
POCT with the lowest sensitivities (Fassisi®Parvo (27.7% overall, 36.7% group P),
Primagnost®ParvoH+K (24.3% overall, 34.7% group P), FASTest®PARVOCard (22.9%
overall, 32.7% group P)). The agreement among all POCT was at least substantial
(kappa >0.80). A positive POCT result confirmed the infection with CPV in
unvaccinated dogs, whereas a negative POCT result did not definitely exclude CPV 
infection due to the low sensitivity of all POCT.
