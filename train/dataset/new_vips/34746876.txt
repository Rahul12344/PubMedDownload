Psychiatric sequelae substantially contribute to the post-acute burden of disease
associated with COVID-19, persisting months after clearance of the virus. Brain
imaging shows white matter (WM) hypodensities/hyperintensities, and the
involvement of grey matter (GM) in prefrontal, anterior cingulate (ACC) and
insular cortex after COVID, but little is known about brain correlates of
persistent psychopathology. With a multimodal approach, we studied whole brain
voxel-based morphometry, diffusion-tensor imaging, and resting-state
connectivity, to correlate MRI measures with depression and post-traumatic
distress (PTSD) in 42 COVID-19 survivors without brain lesions, at
90.59 ​± ​54.66 days after COVID. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII)
measured in the emergency department, which reflects the immune response and
systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet
counts, predicted worse self-rated depression and PTSD, widespread lower
diffusivity along the main axis of WM tracts, and abnormal functional
connectivity (FC) among resting state networks. Self-rated depression and PTSD
inversely correlated with GM volumes in ACC and insula, axial diffusivity, and
associated with FC. We observed overlapping associations between severity of
inflammation during acute COVID-19, brain structure and function, and severity of
depression and post-traumatic distress in survivors, thus warranting interest for
further study of brain correlates of the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Beyond
COVID-19, these findings support the hypothesis that regional GM, WM
microstructure, and FC could mediate the relationship between a medical illness
and its psychopathological sequelae, and are in agreement with current
perspectives on the brain structural and functional underpinnings of depressive
psychopathology.
