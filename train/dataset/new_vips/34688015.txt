While higher anxiety during antenatal period cause several maternal and foetal
health related complications, lower anxiety levels are found to be associated
with lesser "precautionary behaviours" and consequently greater risk of
infection, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess rates 
and determinants of generalized anxiety at the time of the pandemic as well as
anxiety that was specific to the context of being pregnant during the COVID-19
pandemic. (COVID-19-antenatal anxiety) in Indian women. This hospital-based,
cross-sectional study using face-to-face interviews was conducted at antenatal
clinics of five medical college hospitals in India. The Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 scale (GAD -7) and a customized scale to assess antenatal COVID-19
anxiety along with other tools that assessed social support and COVID-19-risk
perception were administered to 620 pregnant women. We found that the percentage 
of women with moderate or severe anxiety based on GAD -7 was 11.1%. Multivariate 
analysis showed that higher COVID-19-risk perception, greater antenatal COVID-19 
anxiety and lower perceived support significantly predicted moderate and severe
generalized anxiety. Greater number of weeks of gestation, lower education,
semiurban habitat and lower perceived social support were significant predictors 
of antenatal COVID-19 anxiety. We conclude that the rates of anxiety in pregnant 
women though not very high, still warrant attention and specific interventions.
