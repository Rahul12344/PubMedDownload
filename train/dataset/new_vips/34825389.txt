Avian leukosis virus (ALV) poses a major threat to poultry. The chicken gut
microbiota plays critical roles in host performance, health and immunity.
However, the effect of viral infection on the microbiota of Chinese local
chickens is not well understood. In this study, we performed high-throughput 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing and evaluated the gut microbiota profiles using faeces from 
ALV subgroup J (ALV-J)-infected and healthy Huiyang bearded chickens (Chinese
local chickens). At the phylum level, ALV-J infection mainly increased the
abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decreased that of Firmicutes.
An analysis at the order, family and genus levels showed that the abundance of
Lactobacillales, Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus was the highest in normal
chicken faeces, accounting for 89·07%, 86·47% and 86·46%, respectively, of
phylotypes. Moreover, samples from ALV-J-infected chickens were enriched with
Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae
and Bacteroides. Our findings highlight that ALV-J infection alters the gut
microbiota and disrupts the host-microbial homeostasis in chickens, which may be 
involved in the pathogenesis of ALV-J infection.
