Community perceptions of early-stage pandemics may have significant implications 
for subsequent disease control and management. Perceptions of COVID-19 among
Indonesian citizens were assessed 2 months after the first reported case in the
country. The study used an online survey tool, which was adapted from a
standardized questionnaire for risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak.
The questions of the survey involved respondents' perceived level of knowledge,
preparedness, efficacy of control measures, newness, infectiousness, seriousness,
motivating and hindering factors, and effectiveness of prevention methods, as
well as questions that assessed actual level of knowledge of respondents such as 
causative agents, modes of transmission, number of total cases, and available
control measures. A total of 1,043 respondents participated in this study. The
main sources of information of respondents were social media (85.2%) and online
news (82.2%). Nearly all respondents were aware that COVID-19 is a viral disease 
with saliva droplets (97.1%) and contaminated surfaces (86.5%) being its main
modes of transmission. Participants showed a good level of knowledge pertaining
to control measures, an adequate level of belief toward their efficacy, and a
willingness to implement such measures. More than 95% of the respondents
perceived COVID-19 to be either serious or very serious. However, the level of
anxiety among respondents was moderate, suggesting the presence of risk tolerance
in the community. Individual characteristics such as gender, educational
background, and occupation were found to have a statistically significant
relationship with risk perception and tolerance, but voluntary participation in
control measures was high and similar. This indicates that the COVID-19 health
campaign during early pandemic in Indonesia was a success. This research also
revealed certain areas where health promotion, education, and awareness might be 
improved.
