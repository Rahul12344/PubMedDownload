PURPOSE: To prospectively validate two risk scores to predict mortality (4C
Mortality) and in-hospital deterioration (4C Deterioration) among adults
hospitalised with COVID-19.
METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study of adults (age ≥18 years) with
confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 recruited into the International Severe
Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical
Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study in 306 hospitals across England,
Scotland and Wales. Patients were recruited between 27 August 2020 and 17
February 2021, with at least 4 weeks follow-up before final data extraction. The 
main outcome measures were discrimination and calibration of models for
in-hospital deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or
critical care, or death) and mortality, incorporating predefined subgroups.
RESULTS: 76 588 participants were included, of whom 27 352 (37.4%) deteriorated
and 12 581 (17.4%) died. Both the 4C Mortality (0.78 (0.77 to 0.78)) and 4C
Deterioration scores (pooled C-statistic 0.76 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.77)) demonstrated
consistent discrimination across all nine National Health Service regions, with
similar performance metrics to the original validation cohorts. Calibration
remained stable (4C Mortality: pooled slope 1.09, pooled calibration-in-the-large
0.12; 4C Deterioration: 1.00, -0.04), with no need for temporal recalibration
during the second UK pandemic wave of hospital admissions.
CONCLUSION: Both 4C risk stratification models demonstrate consistent performance
to predict clinical deterioration and mortality in a large prospective second
wave validation cohort of UK patients. Despite recent advances in the treatment
and management of adults hospitalised with COVID-19, both scores can continue to 
inform clinical decision making.
