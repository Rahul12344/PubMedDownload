Fibroblasts from two patients carrying a heterozygous mutation in the translation
initiation codon (c.2 T > G) of the kelch-like protein 24 (KLHL24) gene were used
to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), using non-integrating 
Sendai virus to deliver reprogramming factors. CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used for
genetic correction of the mutation in the patient-hiPSCs. The top-predicted
off-target sites were not altered. Patient and isogenic hiPSCs showed typical
morphology, expressed pluripotency-associated markers, had the capacity for in
vitro differentiation into the three germ layers and displayed a normal
karyotype. These isogenic pairs will enable in vitro modelling of
KLHL24-associated heart and skin conditions.
