We report a case of a heart transplant recipient who presented with a rapidly
growing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 7 days
after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Because of the
atypical radiologic presentation, the initial tentative diagnosis was a
mediastinal abscess. This observation indicates a potential risk of EBV
reactivation after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, which might
lead to or aggravate the presentation of posttransplant lymphoproliferative
disorder in transplantation patients. Transplant surgeons should be aware of the 
potential immunomodulatory effects of the COVID-19 vaccination.
