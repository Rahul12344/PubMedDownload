Pneumonia is a major cause of global mortality in developed countries. The
adequacy of the antibiotic treatment is essential for the good evolution of the
patients. When selecting the antimicrobial, the severity of the patient, the
characteristics of the antibiotics, and the profile of the patient to be treated 
should be considered. Recommendations for the selection of antibiotic treatment
may differ between the patient who requires admission and the one who can be
treated as outpatient. Beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are the
most widely used antimicrobials in this last circumstance. However, not all are
the same in terms of efficacy, safety and ecological impact. This review delves
into the aforementioned aspects to improve decision-making and offers concrete
recommendations for the selection of antibiotic treatment. Likewise, it includes 
recommendations for performing sequential therapy. Finally, a brief review is
made about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on this pathology.
