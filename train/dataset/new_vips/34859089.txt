Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important contagious transboundary disease
that causes a significant economic loss for several countries. The FMD virus
(FMDV) can spread very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission among
susceptible animals. The complexity and magnitude of FMDV transmission at the
initial stages of the epidemic can be expressed by the basic reproductive number 
(R 0), and furthermore, control strategies can be assessed by the estimation of
the effective reproductive number. In this study, we aimed to describe FMD
outbreaks among smallholder cattle farms by subdistricts in the northern Thailand
and compute the effective reproductive number for outbreaks caused by FMDV
serotype O and overall serotypes, including serotype O, serotype A, and
unidentified serotype, at the subdistrict level (R sd ) using an epidemic
doubling time method. Field data of FMD outbreaks during 2015-2017 that affected 
94 subdistricts in northern Thailand were assessed to estimate the R sd . Results
showed that 63.38% (90/142) of the FMD outbreak episodes in cattle were caused by
FMDV serotype O. The average doubling time and the R sd estimated of the
outbreaks caused by FMDV serotype O and overall serotype were 2.80 and 4.67
months, and 1.06 and 1.04, respectively. Our results indicated that transmission 
of FMD in cattle at the subdistrict level in northern Thailand was not controlled
(R sd > 1), which indicates the endemicity of the disease in the region. Although
control measures are in place, the results from this study highlighted the need
for enhancing FMD monitoring and control strategies in northern Thailand.
