Early March 2019, health authorities of Matadi in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo alerted a sudden increase in acute fever/arthralgia cases, prompting an
outbreak investigation. We collected surveillance data, clinical data, and
laboratory specimens from clinical suspects (for CHIKV-PCR/ELISA, malaria RDT),
semi-structured interviews with patients/caregivers about perceptions and health 
seeking behavior, and mosquito sampling (adult/larvae) for CHIKV-PCR and
estimation of infestation levels. The investigations confirmed a large CHIKV
outbreak that lasted February-June 2019. The total caseload remained unknown due 
to a lack of systematic surveillance, but one of the two health zones of Matadi
notified 2686 suspects. Of the clinical suspects we investigated (n = 220), 83.2%
were CHIKV-PCR or IgM positive (acute infection). One patient had an isolated
IgG-positive result (while PCR/IgM negative), suggestive of past infection. In
total, 15% had acute CHIKV and malaria. Most adult mosquitoes and larvae (>95%)
were Aedes albopictus. High infestation levels were noted. CHIKV was detected in 
6/11 adult mosquito pools, and in 2/15 of the larvae pools. This latter and the
fact that 2/6 of the CHIKV-positive adult pools contained only males suggests
transovarial transmission. Interviews revealed that healthcare seeking shifted
quickly toward the informal sector and self-medication. Caregivers reported
difficulties to differentiate CHIKV, malaria, and other infectious diseases
resulting in polypharmacy and high out-of-pocket expenditure. We confirmed a
first major CHIKV outbreak in Matadi, with main vector Aedes albopictus. The
health sector was ill-prepared for the information, surveillance, and treatment
needs for such an explosive outbreak in a CHIKV-naïve population. Better
surveillance systems (national level/sentinel sites) and point-of-care
diagnostics for arboviruses are needed.
