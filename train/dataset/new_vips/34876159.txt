BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge challenge worldwide.
Although previous studies have suggested that type I interferon (IFN-I) could
inhibit the virus replication, the expression characteristics of IFN-I
signaling-related miRNAs (ISR-miRNAs) during acute severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its relationship with
receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody response at the recovery phase remain 
unclear.
METHODS: Expression profiles of 12 plasma ISR-miRNAs in COVID-19 patients and
healthy controls were analyzed using RT-qPCR. The level of RBD-IgG antibody was
determined using the competitive ELISA. Spearman correlation was done to measure 
the associations of plasma ISR-miRNAs with clinical characteristics during acute 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and RBD-IgG antibody response at the recovery phase.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, COVID-19 patients exhibited higher
levels of miR-29b-3p (Z = 3.15, P = 0.002) and miR-1246 (Z = 4.98, P < 0.001).
However, the expression of miR-186-5p and miR-15a-5p were significantly
decreased. As the results shown, miR-30b-5p was negatively correlated with
CD4 + T cell counts (r = - 0.41, P = 0.027) and marginally positively correlated 
with fasting plasma glucose in COVID-19 patients (r = 0.37, P = 0.052). The
competitive ELISA analysis showed the plasma level of miR-497-5p at the acute
phase was positively correlated with RBD-IgG antibody response (r = 0.48,
P = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Our present results suggested that the expression level of
ISR-miRNAs was not only associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but also with 
RBD-IgG antibody response at the recovery phase of COVID-19. Future studies
should be performed to explore the biological significance of ISR-miRNAs in
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
