Background: Indonesia has started the big project of COVID-19 vaccination program
since 13 January 2021 by employing the first shot of vaccine to the President of 
Indonesia as the outbreak and rapid transmission of COVID-19 have endangered not 
only Indonesian but the global health and economy. This study aimed to
investigate the full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2
isolates as of 12 January 2021.
Results: All data of the isolates were extracted from the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database. CoVsurver platform was
employed to investigate the full-length genome mutation analysis of all isolates.
This study also focused on the phylogeny analysis in unlocking the mutation of S 
protein in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. WIV04 isolate that was originated from
Wuhan, China was used as the virus reference according to the CoVsurver default. 
The result showed that a full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates was successfully generated. Every single mutation in S
protein was described and then visualized by utilizing BioRender platform.
Furthermore, it also found that D614G mutation appeared in 103 Indonesian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates.
Conclusions: To sum up, this study helped to observe the spread of COVID-19
transmission. However, it also proposed that the epidemiological surveillance and
genomics studies might be improved on COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.
