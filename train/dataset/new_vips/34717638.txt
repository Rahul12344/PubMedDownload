We argue commercial sex workers have rights to healthcare and psychosocial
support. While decriminalization is not legally enacted in most countries, we
would suggest these workers rights include freedom from harassment and
opportunities to lead healthy lives. The need for healthcare access for all is
heightened in the COVID-19 pandemic where some people flout rules on lockdown by 
engaging with commercial sex workers and may unwittingly spread SARS-CoV-2 in so 
doing. Unrestricted healthcare access without stigma for commercial sex workers
protects them, and has a beneficial societal effect on those who engage with them
and on their contacts.
