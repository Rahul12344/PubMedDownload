Population-level physical activity (PA) and sedentary time/behaviour estimates
represent a significant public health issue exacerbated by restrictions enforced 
to control COVID-19. This integrative review interrogated available literature to
explore the pandemic's impact on correlates of such behaviours in adults (â‰¥18
years). Five electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2021.
Data extracted from 64 articles were assessed for risk-of-bias using the Mixed
Methods Assessment Tool, with correlates identified, coded, and themed via
thematic analysis. A socioecological model of during-pandemic PA was
conceptualized and mapped to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and
Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change mechanisms, which illustrates
influences over five levels: Individual (biological)-general health; Individual
(psychological)-mental health, cognition, motivation, and behaviour;
Social-domestic situation, sociodemographic factors, support, and lifestyle
choices; Environmental-resources and area of residence; and
Policy-COVID-19-related rules. For sedentary time/behaviour, individual level
factors, namely general and mental health, may be important correlates. Neither
age or sex were clearly correlated with either behaviour. As we transition into a
new normal, understanding which behaviour mechanisms could effectively challenge 
physical inactivity is essential. Targeting capability on a psychological level
may facilitate PA and limit sedentary time/behaviour, whereas, on a physical
level, maximizing PA opportunities could be crucial.
