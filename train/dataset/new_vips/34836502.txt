BACKGROUND: Effective vaccines are now available for SARS-CoV-2 in the 2nd year
of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there remains significant uncertainty surrounding
the necessary vaccination rate to safely lift occupancy controls in public
buildings and return to pre-pandemic norms. The aim of this paper is to estimate 
setting-specific vaccination thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 to prevent sustained
community transmission using classical principles of airborne contagion modeling.
We calculated the airborne infection risk in three settings, a classroom, prison 
cell block, and restaurant, at typical ventilation rates, and then the expected
number of infections resulting from this risk at varying percentages of occupant 
immunity.
RESULTS: We estimate the setting-specific immunity threshold for control of
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to range from a low of 40% for a mechanically ventilation
classroom to a high of 85% for a naturally ventilated restaurant.
CONCLUSIONS: If vaccination rates are limited to a theoretical minimum of
approximately two-thirds of the population, enhanced ventilation above minimum
standards for acceptable air quality is needed to reduce the frequency and
severity of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in high-risk indoor environments.
