Despite the 2019 Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, 
kidney disease has moved up in rank from the 9th to the 8th leading cause of
death in the United States. A recent push in the field of nephrology has been to 
identify molecular markers and/or molecular profiles involved in kidney disease
process or injury that can help identify the cause of injury and predict patient 
outcomes. While these studies have had moderate success, they have not yet
considered that many of the health conditions that cause kidney disease
(diabetes, hypertension, etc.) can also be caused by environmental factors (such 
as viruses), which in and of themselves can cause kidney disease. Thus, the goal 
of this study was to identify molecular and phenotypic profiles that can
differentiate kidney injury caused by diabetes (a health condition resulting in
kidney disease) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) exposure (which can cause diabetes
and/or kidney disease), both alone and together. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice
were used for this study due to their susceptibility to both type 1 diabetes
(T1D)- and CVB4-mediated kidney injury, in order to glean a better understanding 
of how hyperglycemia and viral exposure, when occurring on their own and in
combination, may alter the kidneys' molecular and phenotypic profiles. While no
changes in kidney function were observed, molecular biomarkers of kidney injury
were significantly up- and downregulated based on T1D and CVB4 exposure, both
alone and together, but not in a predictable pattern. By combining individual
biomarkers with function and phenotypic measurements (i.e., urinary albumin
creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, kidney weight, and body weight), we were able
to perform an unbiased separation of injury group based on the type of injury.
This study provides evidence that unique kidney injury profiles within a kidney
disease health condition are identifiable, and will help us to identify the
causes of kidney injury in the future.
