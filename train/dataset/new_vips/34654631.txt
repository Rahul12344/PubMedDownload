INTRODUCTION: Vaccination is a key global strategy to mitigate the clinical
impact of the COVID-19 virus. As part of local efforts to manage the outbreak,
the government of Ghana announced its intention to vaccinate its population
starting with essential and high-risk workers including radiographers. However,
there were reports of hesitance to receiving the vaccine among the radiography
workforce. This study was undertaken prior to the intended vaccination exercise
to assess the willingness and concerns of radiographers to undergo the COVID-19
vaccination and to suggest recommendations to improve the vaccine uptake.
METHODS: An ethically-approved online survey strategy was employed for this
cross-sectional study conducted between 24th-28th February 2021. The survey
employed quantitative questions and open text response options. Quantitative and 
open text responses were analysed using statistical and thematic analyses,
respectively.
RESULTS: There were 108 responses (response rate of 46.3%). The majority (n = 64,
59.3%) were willing to have the vaccine, however, some (n = 44, 40.7%) were not. 
The main reason behind their willingness to have the vaccine was its ability to
reduce the spread of infections and lower mortality (n = 35, 54.7%). However,
doubts about the vaccine's efficacy and side effects (n = 26, 56.8%), conspiracy 
theory concerns about its effects on the Ghanaian race (n = 4, 9.1%), and
fertility concerns (n = 2, 4.5%) were some reasons for their hesitance to receive
the vaccine. The open text commentary further revealed that the vaccine was
thought of as a lifesaving medication, however, clinical safety concerns, lack of
education/information and religious beliefs were affecting peoples' willingness
to be vaccinated.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the need for an urgent public health
educational intervention to address the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy concerns
raised by radiographers to help increase the vaccine uptake.
IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: The study provides pertinent information to improve
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among radiographers to limit the spread of infections.
