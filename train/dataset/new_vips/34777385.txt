Despite the availability of effective vaccination, hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection continues to be a major challenge worldwide. Research efforts are
ongoing to find an effective cure for the estimated 250 million people
chronically infected by HBV in recent years. The exceptionally limited host
spectrum of HBV has limited the research progress. Thus, different HBV mouse
models have been developed and used for studies on infection, immune responses,
pathogenesis, and antiviral therapies. However, these mouse models have great
limitations as no spread of HBV infection occurs in the mouse liver and no or
only very mild hepatitis is present. Thus, the suitability of these mouse models 
for a given issue and the interpretation of the results need to be critically
assessed. This review summarizes the currently available mouse models for HBV
research, including hydrodynamic injection, viral vector-mediated transfection,
recombinant covalently closed circular DNA (rc-cccDNA), transgenic, and liver
humanized mouse models. We systematically discuss the characteristics of each
model, with the main focus on hydrodynamic injection mouse model. The usefulness 
and limitations of each mouse model are discussed based on the published studies.
This review summarizes the facts for considerations of the use and suitability of
mouse model in future HBV studies.
