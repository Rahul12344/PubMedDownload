Post COVID-19, mucormycosis occurred after the SARS-CoV-2 has rampaged the human 
population and is a scorching problem among the pandemic globally, particularly
among Asian countries. Invasive mucormycosis has been extensively reported from
mild to severe COVID-19 survivors. The robust predisposing factor seems to be
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, comorbidity and immunosuppression acquired
through steroid therapy. The prime susceptive reason for the increase of
mucormycosis cases is elevated iron levels in the serum of the COVID survivors. A
panoramic understanding of the infection has been elucidated based on clinical
manifestation, genetic and non- genetic mechanisms of steroid drug
administration, biochemical pathways and immune modulated receptor associations. 
This review lime-lights and addresses the "What", "Why", "How" and "When" about
the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) in a comprehensive manner with a pure 
intention to bring about awareness to the common public as the cases are
inevitably and exponentially increasing in India and global countries as well.
The article also unearthed the pathogenesis of mucormycosis and its association
with the COVID-19 sequela, the plausible routes of entry, diagnosis and counter
remedies to keep the infection at bay. Cohorts of case reports were analysed to
spotlight the link between the pandemic COVID-19 and the nightmare-mucormycosis.
