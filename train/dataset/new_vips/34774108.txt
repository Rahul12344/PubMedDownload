BACKGROUND: Multiple psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and
quarantine have been described. However, there is a lack of global
conceptualization. We argue that the stressful aspects of the situation, the
multiple environmental consequences of the outbreak, and the diversity of
symptoms observed in such a situation, suggest that Adjustment disorder (AD) is a
promising way to conceptualize the psychological consequences of the outbreak and
quarantine. The first aim of the study was to validate the French version of the 
ADNM. The second aim was to set out adjustment difficulties resulting from
COVID-19 outbreak and quarantine.
METHOD: We recruited 1010 (840 women, 170 men) who consented online to
participate. They filled out the French ADNM, visual analogic scales, HADS, IES, 
and the COPE, to evaluate coping strategies.
RESULTS: We confirmed the factor structure of the ADNM and we found good
psychometric properties. We found that 61.3% of participants presented an
adjustment disorder related to COVID-19 outbreak. We found multiple risk factors 
and protective factors to AD due to quarantine and outbreak. We also identified
the coping strategies negatively and positively associated with AD.
CONCLUSION: Adjustment disorder is a relevant concept to understand psychological
manifestations caused by quarantine and outbreak. The French ANDM has good
psychometric properties to evaluate such manifestations. The association between 
coping strategies and AD symptoms suggest that CBT may be the best intervention
to help people suffering from AD.
