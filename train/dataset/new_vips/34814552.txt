Objective: To analyze the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid 
testing in 20 348 close contacts of COVID-19 cases in different prevention and
control stages in Guangzhou and to provide scientific evidence for optimizing
epidemic response strategies. Methods: A total of 20 348 close contacts of
COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou were traced between February 21 and September
22,2020. All the close contacts were tested for the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2.
The sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid testing and diagnosis in the
different prevention and control stages were compared. Results: In 20 348 close
contacts, 12 462 were males (61.24%), the median (P25,P75) of age of them was
31.0 years (23.0,43.0), the median number (P25,P75) of nucleic acid testing for
them was 2.0 (1.0,3.0), and the median (P25,P75) of their quarantine days was
12.0 (8.0,13.0) days, respectively. A total of 256 COVID-19 cases were confirmed 
in the close contacts after seven nucleic acid tests. In the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and
7th nucleic acid testing, the sensitivity and specificity were 69.14% and 99.99% 
(177 cases confirmed), 89.84% and 99.99% (230 cases confirmed), 97.27% and 99.99%
(249 cases confirmed), and 100.00% and 99.98%, respectively. In the three stages 
of COVID-19 prevention and control in China: domestic case stage, imported case
stage, and imported case associated local epidemic stage, the sensitivity of the 
1st nucleic acid testing was 70.68%, 68.00% and 67.35%, and the specificity was
99.98%, 100.00% and 100.00%, respectively. Conclusions: The sensitivity of
nucleic acid testing in the close contacts at the different stages were
consistent with slight decrease, which might be related to the increased
proportion of asymptomatic infections in the late stage of epidemic prevention
and control with COVID-19 in Guangzhou. It is suggested to give three nucleic
acid tests to improve the sensitivity and reduce false negative risk.

分析广州市新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情防控不同阶段中，密切接触者新型冠状病毒（新冠病毒）核酸检测的灵敏度和特异度，为优化疫情防控策略提供科学依据。
方法： 2020年2月21日至9月22日广州市COVID-19病例的密切接触者20
348例，均已接受新冠病毒核酸检测。针对疫情防控的不同阶段，比较核酸检测的灵敏度和特异度。 结果： 20 348例密切接触者中，男性12
462例（61.24%），年龄M（P25，P75）为31.0（23.0，43.0）岁，核酸检测次数M（P25，P75）为2.0（1.0，3.0）次，隔离天数M（P
25，P75）为12.0（8.0，13.0）d。研究对象经过7次核酸检测后，共确诊病例256例。第1、2、3和第7次核酸检测的灵敏度与特异度分别为69.14%与9
9.99%（确诊177例）、89.84%与99.99%（确诊230例）、97.27%与99.99%（确诊249例）、100.00%与99.98%。基于我国COVI
D-19疫情防控分为3个阶段（国内输入、境外输入和境外输入关联），首次核酸检测的灵敏度分别为70.68%、68.00%和67.35%，特异度分别为99.98%、1
00.00%和100.00%。 结论：
建议做核酸检测3次，可提高灵敏度并降低假阴性风险。对于广州市COVID-19疫情防控3个阶段，密切接触者核酸检测的灵敏度结果较为一致，但略有降低趋势，这可能与疫情
防控后期阶段的无症状感染者比例增多相关。.
