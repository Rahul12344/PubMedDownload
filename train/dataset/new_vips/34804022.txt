COVID-19 pandemic remains an on-going global health and economic threat that has 
amassed millions of deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of this disease and is constantly under
evolutionary pressures that drive the modification of its genome which may
represent a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines available. This
article highlights the pressures that facilitate the rise of new SARS-CoV-2
variants and the key mutations of the viral spike protein - L452R, E484K, N501Y
and D614G- that promote immune escape mechanism and warrant a cautionary point
for clinical and public health responses in terms of re-infection, vaccine
breakthrough infection and therapeutic values.
