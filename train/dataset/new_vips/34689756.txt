BACKGROUND: Reflective notes in nursing education can facilitate students'
understanding of how individuals in need of home healthcare services experience
unfamiliar situations, such as a pandemic. The aim of this study is to describe
the consequences of the COVID-19 virus for individuals receiving homecare
services through the eyes of nursing students.
METHODS: This is a qualitative descriptive study using content analysis to
examine reflection notes from 17 nursing students in their last year of academic 
studies while undertaking home healthcare service training.
RESULTS: Our study shows students' reflections on the consequences of the
COVID-19 virus on individuals needing home healthcare services and their
families. The analysis reveals three categories that described the effect of the 
virus according to students' reflections: i) how social life became restricted
and only includes the closest family members and home healthcare staff (declining
social circle), ii) how family members take on more responsibility to care for
the individual and the pronounced impact of this on the day-to-day lives of the
individual's next of kin (expanding responsibility of care), and iii) actions and
reactions related to preventing the spread of the virus (dealing with the
invisible threat).
CONCLUSIONS: Students' reflection notes show that COVID-19 had major
consequences, not only on the individuals receiving home healthcare services, but
also on their relatives and on home healthcare staff.
