Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was detected immunohistochemically in contagious
ecthyma (orf virus) dermatitis in two muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), harvested and 
found dead in 2014 and 2015, respectively, on Victoria Island, Canada. This may
help target further research on E. rhusiopathiae epidemiology and mechanisms of
infection in muskoxen, recently associated with widespread mortalities in
Canada's Arctic.
