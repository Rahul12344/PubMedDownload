BACKGROUND: The JEV genome is a positive-sense RNA with a highly structured
capped 5'UTR, 3'UTR and a large open reading frame. 3'UTR is the untranslated
region of flavivirus and has various important functions during viral
replication, such as translation, replication and encapsidation. During viral
replication, the 3'UTR interacts with viral proteins and host proteins and is
required for viral RNA replication and translocation.
METHODS: The expression level of FUBP3 was knocked down by siRNA and Flag-tagged 
FUBP3 overexpression plasmid was constructed for overexpression. BHK-21 cells
were cultured and infected with JEV to investigate the functional role of FUBP3
in the viral infection cycle. Subcellular localization of FUBP3 and viral
replication complexes was observed by dual immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Four host proteins were specifically associated with the 3'UTR of JEV,
and FUBP3 was selected to further investigate its potential functional role in
the JEV infection cycle. Knockdown of FUBP3 protein resulted in a significant
decrease in JEV viral titer, whereas ectopic overexpression of FUBP3 resulted in 
increased JE viral infectivity. In cells stably knocked down for FUBP3 and then
infected with JEV, we found almost no detectable viral NS5 protein. In contrast, 
when cells stably knocking-down of FUBP3 overexpressed FUBP3, we found a
significant increase in viral RNA production over time compared to controls. We
also demonstrated that FUBP3 re-localized in the cytoplasm after infection with
JEV and co-localized with viral proteins. Exogenous overexpression of FUBP3 was
also shown to be located in the JE replication complex and to assist viral
replication after JEV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall results suggest that FUBP3 regulates RNA replication of 
JEV and promotes subsequent viral translation and viral particle production.
