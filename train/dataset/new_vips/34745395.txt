Epidemiological data about determinants of influenza A virus (IAV) in the
Pakistani population is scarce. We aimed to conduct a prospective hospital-based 
active surveillance study from October 2015 to May 2016 to identify potential
risk factors associated with IAV infection among patients with influenza-like
illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Surveillance was
conducted in Lahore General Hospital, selected as a sentinel site in Lahore
District, Pakistan. Nasal/throat samples were collected along with
epidemiological and clinical data from enrolled patients. Real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to
identify IAV and its subtypes (H1N1pdm09, H3N2). Data were analyzed to determine 
risk factors and risk markers associated with IAV infections. A total of 311
suspected ILI and SARI cases were enrolled in the study, and among these 50 were 
IAV-positive. Of these 50 confirmed cases of IAV, 14 were subtyped as H1N1pdm09
and 15 were H3N2; the remaining 21 were untyped. A final multivariable model
identified four independent risk factors/markers for IAV infection: exposure
history to ILI patients within last 7 days and gender being male were identified 
as risk factors of IAV infection, while use of antibiotics prior to hospital
consultation and presence of fever were identified as risk markers. We concluded 
that adopting nonpharmaceutical interventions like hand hygiene, masks, social
distancing, and where possible, avoiding identified risk factors could decrease
the risk of IAV infection and may prevent imminent outbreaks of IAV in the
community.
