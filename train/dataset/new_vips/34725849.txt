Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is among the most studied human malignancies. The
distinction of BL from other aggressive B-cell lymphomas is important for
providing optimal oncological care. In the revised 4th edition of the World
Health Organization (WHO) classification, BL is defined as "a highly aggressive
but curable lymphoma that often presents in extranodal sites or as an acute
leukemia. It is composed of monomorphic medium-sized B-cells with basophilic
cytoplasm and numerous mitotic figures, usually with a demonstrable MYC gene
translocation to an IG locus. The frequency of EBV (Epstein Barr virus) infection
varies according to the epidemiological subtype of BL. No single parameter, such 
as morphologic, genetic analysis or immunophenotyping can be used as the gold
standard for diagnosis of BL; a combination of several diagnostic techniques is
necessary."
