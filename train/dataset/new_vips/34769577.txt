The identification of COVID-19 waves is a matter of the utmost importance, both
for research and decision making. This study uses COVID-19 information from the
52 municipalities of the Metropolitan Region, Chile, and presents a quantitative 
method-based on weekly accumulated incidence rates-to define COVID-19 waves. We
explore three different criteria to define the duration of a wave, and performed 
a sensitivity analysis using multivariate linear models to show their
commonalities and differences. The results show that, compared to a benchmark
definition (a 100-day wave), the estimations using longer periods of study are
worse in terms of the model's overall fit (adjusted R2). The article shows that
defining a COVID-19 wave is not necessarily simple, and has consequences when
performing data analysis. The results highlight the need to adopt well-defined
and well-justified definitions for COVID-19 waves, since these methodological
choices can have an impact in research and policy making.
