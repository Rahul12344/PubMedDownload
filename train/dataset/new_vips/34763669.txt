BACKGROUND: There have been cases of minimal change disease (MCD) reported
following previous vaccines. During the COVID-19 era, only 3 cases of new-onset
MCD and a case of MCD relapse were reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine. We herein report the first case of MCD after receiving the
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man presented to hospital 3 weeks after
receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, with both bilateral lower
extremities and scrotal edema. He initially developed a sudden-onset bilateral
lower extremities swelling on day 7 post-vaccine. He, then, developed dyspnea and
scrotal swelling over a time span of 2 weeks. On physical examination, his blood 
pressure was 150/92 mmHg. There was a decreased air entry at lung bases,
bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. Labs revealed hypoalbuminemia,
hyperlipidemia and 15 g of proteinuria. His immunologic and serologic work up was
negative. Renal biopsy showed concomitant MCD and IgA nephropathy. Patient was
treated with oral steroids and had a good response; his edema resolved, serum
albumin improved, and proteinuria decreased to 1 g within 2 weeks of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, MCD has not been previously reported
after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It remains unclear whether the
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are associated with the development of MCD, or it
coincided with the mass vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine the 
incidence of MCD post COVID-19 vaccines and the underlying pathophysiology of
glomerular injury post vaccination.
