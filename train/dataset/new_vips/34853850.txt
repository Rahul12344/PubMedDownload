Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 virus that led to a pandemic. Acute
manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory failure,
pneumonitis, anosmia, thromboembolic events, cardiogenic shock, renal injury,
ischemic strokes, encephalitis, and cutaneous eruptions, especially of hands or
feet. Prolonged symptoms, unpredictable recoveries, and chronic sequelae (long
COVID) sometimes emerge even for some people who survive the initial illness.
Sequelae such as fatigue occasionally persist even for those with only mild to
moderate cases. There is much to learn about postacute COVID-19 dyspnea, anosmia,
psychosis, thyroiditis, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or multisystem inflammatory
response syndrome in children. Determining prognoses is imprecise. Examining
patient databases about those who have survived COVID-19 is warranted.
Multidisciplinary teams are assessing such disease databases to better understand
longer-term complications and guide treatment.
