Continuing the work developed by our research group, in the present manuscript,
we performed a theoretical study of 10 new structures derived from the antivirals
cidofovir and ribavirin, as inhibitor prototypes for the enzyme thymidylate
kinase from Variola virus (VarTMPK). The proposed structures were subjected to
docking calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy
calculations, using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM-PBSA) method, inside the active sites of VarTMPK and human TMPK (HssTMPK).
The docking and molecular dynamic studies pointed to structures 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9
as more selective towards VarTMPK. In addition, the free energy data calculated
through the MM-PBSA method, corroborated these results. This suggests that these 
compounds are potential selective inhibitors of VarTMPK and, thus, can be
considered as template molecules to be synthesized and experimentally evaluated
against smallpox.
