COVID-19 disease has been a pandemic caused by a β-coronavirus severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A life-threatening multisystem
inflammatory syndrome (MIS), secondary to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, sharing
common features with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome,
staphylococcal/streptococcal shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome
in pediatric patients has been described. A total of 27 cases in adults (MIS-A)
with a similar presentation have been reported so far. Here we describe the case 
of a 21-year-old man admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhea, tachycardia, and low
blood pressure. He had elevated troponin, ferritin, and interleukin-2 receptor
levels and had evidence of myocarditis. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibody, and a diagnosis of MIS-A was made. Our case adds to the scant
literature on this topic, and to our knowledge, it is the first case where
anakinra was administered. He recovered well. MIS-A should be considered when
young adults present with multiorgan dysfunction.
