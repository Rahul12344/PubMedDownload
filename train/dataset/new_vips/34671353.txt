Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public
health issue. COVID-19 is considered an airway/multi-systemic disease, and demise
has been associated with an uncontrolled immune response and a cytokine storm in 
response to the virus. However, the lung pathology, immune response, and tissue
damage associated with COVID-19 demise are poorly described and understood due to
safety concerns. Using post-mortem lung tissues from uninfected and COVID-19
deadly cases as well as an unbiased combined analysis of histology, multi-viral
and host markers staining, correlative microscopy, confocal, and image analysis, 
we identified three distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-induced lung damage. First, a
COVID-19-induced hemorrhage characterized by minimal immune infiltration and
large thrombus; Second, a COVID-19-induced immune infiltration with excessive
immune cell infiltration but no hemorrhagic events. The third phenotype
correspond to the combination of the two previous ones. We observed the loss of
alveolar wall integrity, detachment of lung tissue pieces, fibroblast
proliferation, and extensive fibrosis in all three phenotypes. Although lung
tissues studied were from lethal COVID-19, a strong immune response was observed 
in all cases analyzed with significant B cell and poor T cell infiltrations,
suggesting an exhausted or compromised immune cellular response in these
patients. Overall, our data show that SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage is highly
heterogeneous. These individual differences need to be considered to understand
the acute and long-term COVID-19 consequences.
