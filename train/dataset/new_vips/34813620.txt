BACKGROUND: Somalia is considered severely underprepared to contain an outbreak
of COVID-19, with critical shortages in healthcare personnel and treatment
resources. In limited-resource settings such as Somalia, providing healthcare
workers with adequate information on COVID-19 is crucial to improve patient
outcomes and mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study assessed the
knowledge of, preparedness for, and perceptions toward COVID-19 prevention and
treatment among Somali healthcare workers.
METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was completed by 364 Somali
healthcare workers in summer of 2020 utilizing a convenience sampling method.
RESULTS: Participants' most accessed sources of COVID-19 information were from
social media (64.8%), official government and international health organization
websites (51.1%,), and traditional media sources such as radio, TV, and
newspapers (48.1%). A majority of participants demonstrated strong knowledge of
treatment of COVID-19, the severity of COVID-19, and the possible outcomes of
COVID-19, but only 5 out of 10 symptoms listed were correctly identified by more 
than 75% of participants. Although participants indicated seeing a median number 
of 10 patients per week with COVID-19 related symptoms, access to essential
medical resources, such as N95 masks (30.2%), facial protective shields (24.5%), 
and disposable gowns (21.4%), were limited. Moreover, 31.3% agreed that Somalia
was in a good position to contain an emerging outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, 
40.4% of participants agreed that the Somali government's response to the
pandemic was sufficient to protect Somali healthcare professionals.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the need to equip Somali healthcare 
providers with more information, personal protective equipment, and treatment
resources such that they can safely and adequately care for COVID-19 patients and
contain the spread of the virus. Social media and traditional news outlets may be
effective outlets to communicate information regarding COVID-19 and the Somali
government's response to frontline healthcare workers.
