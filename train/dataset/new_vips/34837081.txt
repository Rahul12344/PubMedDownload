Although many studies have focused on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs,
comparatively little is known about the potential effects of the virus on male
fertility. SARS-CoV-2 infection of target cells requires the presence of furin,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and transmembrane protease
serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, cells in the body that express these proteins might be 
highly susceptible to viral entry and downstream effects. Currently, reports
regarding the expression of the viral entry proteins in the testes are
conflicting; however, other members of the SARS-CoV family of viruses - such as
SARS-CoV - have been suspected to cause testicular dysfunction and/or orchitis.
SARS-CoV-2, which displays many similarities to SARS-CoV, could potentially cause
similar adverse effects. Commonalities between SARS family members, taken in
combination with sparse reports of testicular discomfort and altered hormone
levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2, might indicate possible testicular
dysfunction. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential for effects on testis
somatic and germline cells and experimental approaches might be required to help 
identify potential short-term and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male
fertility.
