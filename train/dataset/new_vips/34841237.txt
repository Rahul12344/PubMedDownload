Background: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic, making the early detection 
of the virus crucial. We present an approach for the determination of COVID-19
infection based on breath analysis.
Methods: A high sensitivity mass spectrometer was combined with artificial
intelligence and used to develop a method for the identification of COVID-19 in
human breath within seconds. A set of 1137 positive and negative subjects from
different age groups, collected in two periods from two hospitals in the USA,
from 26 August, 2020 until 15 September, 2020 and from 11 September, 2020 until
11 November, 2020, was used for the method development. The subjects exhaled in a
Tedlar bag, and the exhaled breath samples were subsequently analyzed using a
Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). The
produced mass spectra were introduced to a series of machine learning models. 70%
of the data was used for these sub-models' training and 30% was used for testing.
Findings: A set of 340 samples, 95 positives and 245 negatives, was used for the 
testing. The combined models successfully predicted 77 out of the 95 samples as
positives and 199 out of the 245 samples as negatives. The overall accuracy of
the model was 81.2%. Since over 50% of the total positive samples belonged to the
age group of over 55 years old, the performance of the model in this category was
also separately evaluated on 339 subjects (170 negative and 169 positive). The
model correctly identified 166 out of the 170 negatives and 164 out of the 169
positives. The model accuracy in this case was 97.3%.
Interpretation: The results showed that this method for the identification of
COVID-19 infection is a promising tool, which can give fast and accurate results.
