All descriptions of infectious diseases affecting otters were published in the
Northern Hemisphere, with no occurrence identified in neotropical otters (Lontra 
longicaudis). Consequently, a retrospective histopathological study using
archival tissue samples from six free-living neotropical otters was done to
investigate the possible occurrence of disease patterns associated with common
viral infectious disease agents of the domestic dogs. Immunohistochemical (IHC)
assays were designed to identify intralesional tissue antigens of canine
distemper virus (CDV), and canine adenovirus-1 (CAdV-1) and canine adenovirus-2
(CAdV-2). The most frequent histopathological patterns diagnosed were
interstitial pneumonia (83.33%; 6/5) and hepatocellular vacuolar degeneration
(50%; 3/6). IHC identified intralesional intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity to CDV
antigens in all otters evaluated, with positive immunolabeling occurring within
epithelial cells of the lungs, stomach, kidneys, and liver, and skin.
Intracytoplasmic CAdV-2 antigens were identified within epithelial cells of the
peribronchial glands in four otters with interstitial pneumonia. These findings
resulted in singular and simultaneous infections in these neotropical otters,
represented the first report of concomitant infections by CDV and CAdV-2 in
free-living neotropical otters from the Southern Hemisphere, and suggested that
this mammalian species is susceptible to infections by viral disease agents
common to the domestic dogs and may develop similar histopathologic disease
patterns.
