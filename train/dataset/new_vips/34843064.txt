PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global pandemic that affect the health of
hundreds of millions worldwide. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 infection in people
with chronic human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection is of concern, due to 
their already immunocompromised status. Yet, whether and how the immunological
changes brought about by HIV will affect the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 
acute infection and impact the effectiveness of vaccines remain unclear. We
discuss the intersection of COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals.
RECENT FINDINGS: People living with HIV (PLWH) may be at increased risk of severe
SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease complication due to functional impairment of the
immune system and persistent inflammation, which can be ameliorated by
antiretroviral therapy. Importantly, limited data suggest that current approved
vaccines may be safe and efficacious in PLWH. To address remaining questions and 
supplement limited experimental evidence, more studies examining the interplay
between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 through their impact on the host immune system are
required.
