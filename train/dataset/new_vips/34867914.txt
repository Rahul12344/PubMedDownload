Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are important components of the HIV-1
pandemic. Among 110 reported in the literature, 17 are BF1 intersubtype
recombinant, most of which are of South American origin. Among these, all 5
identified in the Southern Cone and neighboring countries, except Brazil, derive 
from a common recombinant ancestor related to CRF12_BF, which circulates widely
in Argentina, as deduced from coincident breakpoints and clustering in
phylogenetic trees. In a HIV-1 molecular epidemiological study in Spain, we
identified a phylogenetic cluster of 20 samples from 3 separate regions which
were of F1 subsubtype, related to the Brazilian strain, in protease-reverse
transcriptase (Pr-RT) and of subtype B in integrase. Remarkably, 14 individuals
from this cluster (designated BF9) were Paraguayans and only 4 were native
Spaniards. HIV-1 transmission was predominantly heterosexual, except for a
subcluster of 6 individuals, 5 of which were men who have sex with men. Ten
additional database sequences, from Argentina (n = 4), Spain (n = 3), Paraguay (n
= 1), Brazil (n = 1), and Italy (n = 1), branched within the BF9 cluster. To
determine whether it represents a new CRF, near full-length genome (NFLG)
sequences were obtained for 6 viruses from 3 Spanish regions. Bootscan analyses
showed a coincident BF1 recombinant structure, with 5 breakpoints, located in p17
gag , integrase, gp120, gp41-rev overlap, and nef, which was identical to that of
two BF1 recombinant viruses from Paraguay previously sequenced in NFLGs.
Interestingly, none of the breakpoints coincided with those of CRF12_BF. In a
maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, all 8 NFLG sequences grouped in a strongly 
supported clade segregating from previously identified CRFs and from the CRF12_BF
"family" clade. These results allow us to identify a new HIV-1 CRF, designated
CRF66_BF. Through a Bayesian coalescent analysis, the most recent common ancestor
of CRF66_BF was estimated around 1984 in South America, either in Paraguay or
Argentina. Among Pr-RT sequences obtained by us from HIV-1-infected Paraguayans
living in Spain, 14 (20.9%) of 67 were of CRF66_BF, suggesting that CRF66_BF may 
be one of the major HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Paraguay. CRF66_BF is the 
first reported non-Brazilian South American HIV-1 CRF_BF unrelated to CRF12_BF.
