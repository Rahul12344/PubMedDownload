Cervical cancer (CC) is the third leading cause of death in women in Montenegro. 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of CC however, HPV genotype
distribution varies across regions. This study examined the distribution and
impact of vaccine-related high-risk (HR)-HPVs on the development of cervical
dysplasia in Montenegrin women. A total of 187 women who had a clinical
indication for cervical biopsy were enrolled. Based on histopathological
findings, women were classified into 2 groups, with and without dysplasia. HR-HPV
was detected by real-time PCR. Twelve HR-HPV genotypes were detected in 40.6% of 
cervical samples. The 7 most prevalent HR-HPVs in order of decreasing frequency
were HPV 16 (39.5%), 45 (23.7%), 31 (21.0%), 33 (17.1%), 18 (6.6%), 52 (6.6%),
and 58 (6.6%), all of them are targeted by nonavalent vaccine. Vaccine-related
HR-HPVs had a higher prevalence (92.1%) than the other HR-HPVs detected in
HR-HPV-positive samples. Among HR-HPV-positive women, HPV 16 and 33 were more
common in women with dysplasia than in those without dysplasia (HPV 16: 28.9 vs
7.2%; HPV 33: 11.8 vs 3.6%). HPV 16 was the most common HR-HPV genotype in
cervical samples, followed by HPV 45, 31, 33, 18, 52, and 58. HPV 16 and 33 were 
shown to be associated with the development of cervical dysplasia. These results 
indicate that prophylactic nonavalent vaccine can potentially prevent
approximately 90% of HR-HPV infections and 60% of cervical dysplasia cases in
Montenegrin women.
