SARS-CoV-2 induced a pandemic that is reported to have started in Asia and was
then extended to other countries in the world. Main clinical aspects of this
viral infection have been lung injuries with severe pneumonia requiring prolonged
hospitalization and associated morbidities such as venous thromboembolism and/or 
superinfection by bacteria, fungus or other pests. Immediately there was a need
to develop a sustainable therapeutic strategy, such as vaccination. Vaccines
against Covid-19, in fact, exert a protective action for common people and reduce
viral diffusion. Yet, vaccination of a large number of people raises the question
of a well-known complication of several types of vaccines; this complication is
immune thrombocytopenia, which is sometimes associated with thrombosis as well.
In this short review, we summarized mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of
vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia and vaccine-induced
thrombocytopenic thrombosis.
