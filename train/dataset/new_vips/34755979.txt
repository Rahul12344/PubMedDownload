Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare, extremely aggressive malignancy 
with four different clinical variants, all of which are associated with human T
cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Antiretrovirals have been recognized as an
effective therapy after study in clinical trials around the world. However,
oncologists traditionally wait for asymptomatic patients with ATLL to reach a
more severe stage of disease before treatment is initiated. We describe a patient
with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V who presented with asymptomatic dyschromia of her
neck, breast, and jaw. Her clinical, laboratory, and histological findings were
consistent with smoldering type-ATLL. We teamed up with her oncologist to
successfully treat her cutaneous symptoms with interferon-alpha/zidovudine. This 
report demonstrates efficacy with the employment of antiretroviral therapy
immediately following a diagnosis of smoldering type ATLL.
