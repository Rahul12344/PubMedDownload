The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19 or
SARS-CoV-2) epidemic is professed as world disaster producing a worrying
increasing mortality, particularly amongst vulnerable humans worldwide. Whether
COVID-19 has a strong ability for acceptable genetic flexibility that amended for
breaking immune responses quickly, it is critical to understand the adaptation
mechanism between viruses and hosts that allows individuals to follow viral
development. This can contribute to finding the appropriate treatment to combat
the epidemic. However, the present information about viral adaptation mechanisms 
in hosts is still insufficient, and future investigations may reveal the unknown.
Mutations and genetic variations are naturally occurring; however, the current
knowledge about their mechanism and pathways still has many secrets. The present 
review also provides insights into the immune system, immunological memory, and
the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Other fighting methods against COVID-19 
are also highlighted. The potential of antibodies, natural metabolites, and
current suggest vaccines were applied to the face of this new threat.
