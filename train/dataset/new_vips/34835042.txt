The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum
as a trimeric gp160 precursor, which requires proteolytic cleavage by a cellular 
furin protease to mediate virus-cell fusion. Env is conformationally flexible but
controls its transition from the unbound "closed" conformation (State 1) to
downstream CD4-bound conformations (States 2/3), which are required for fusion.
In particular, HIV-1 has evolved several mechanisms that reduce the premature
"opening" of Env which exposes highly conserved epitopes recognized by
non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) capable of mediating antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Env cleavage decreases its conformational
transitions favoring the adoption of the "closed" conformation. Here we altered
the gp160 furin cleavage site to impair Env cleavage and to examine its impact on
ADCC responses mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that 
infected primary CD4+ T cells expressing uncleaved, but not wildtype, Env are
efficiently recognized by nnAbs and become highly susceptible to ADCC responses
mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. Thus, HIV-1 limits the
exposure of uncleaved Env at the surface of HIV-1-infected cells at least in part
to escape ADCC responses.
