Introduction: The ecology of the vertebrate host contributes to the geographical 
range expansion of ticks. In this study, we investigated which tick taxa that
infest and are dispersed by birds along African-Western Palaearctic flyways
during northward migration, and whether bird ecology was associated with tick
taxa.
Materials and methods: Ticks were collected from birds trapped at bird
observatories in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Israel during the spring migration of 
2014 and 2015, using mist nets. The tick-infested bird species were classified
into guilds, using different combinations of the variables: migration distance,
wintering region, foraging behaviour, and winter habitat. Ticks were molecularly 
determined to genus and species level by sequencing fragments of the 12S
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene and by phylogenetic inference, using the Maximum
Likelihood algorithm. Data were analysed using descriptive measures, graphs, Chi2
tests, the Tukey-Kramer test, and a parametric linear model (generalized linear
model) in order to analyse and adjust for characteristics in the bird guilds and 
their relationship to collected tick taxa.
Results: Most (84.2%) of the 10,209 trapped birds were long-distance migrants, of
which 2.4% were infested by ticks. The most common tick species was Hyalomma
rufipes (77.7%; 447/575), a known vector and reservoir of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus. Bird guilds containing only long-distance migrants with 
wintering areas in Africa were associated with the tick species H. rufipes
(p < 0.0001). Furthermore, bird winter habitat was associated with H. rufipes
(p = 0.003); with bird species overwintering in open habitat (p = 0.014) and
wetlands (p = 0.046) having significantly more H. rufipes as compared to birds
with a winter habitat comprising forest and shrubs (p = 0.82).
Conclusions: With climate change, the likelihood of establishment of permanent
Hyalomma populations in central and northern Europe is increasing. Thus,
surveillance programs for monitoring the risk of introduction and establishment
of H. rufipes in the Western-Palaearctic should be established. Our study
suggests that migratory bird species wintering in African open habitats and
wetlands are good candidates for monitoring potential introduction.
