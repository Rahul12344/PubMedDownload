Background: This study reports a systematic review of association between
meteorological parameters and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in mainland
China.
Methods: Using predefined study eligibility criteria, three electronic databases 
(PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) were searched for relevant articles. Using a
combination of search terms, including "Hand foot and mouth disease," "HFMD,"
"Meteorological," "Climate," and "China," After removal of duplicates, our
initial search generated 2435 studies published from 1990 to December 31, 2019.
From this cohort 51 full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility assessment. 
The meta-analysis was devised in accordance with the published guidelines of the 
Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analysis (PRISMA). Effect sizes, heterogeneity estimates and publication
bias were computed using R software and Review Manager Software.
Results: The meta-analysis of 18 eligible studies showed that the meteorological 
parameters played an important role in the prevalence of HFMD. Lower air pressure
may be the main risk factor for the incidence of HFMD in Chinese mainland, and
three meteorological parameters (mean temperature, rainfall and relative
humidity) have a significant association with the incidence of HFMD in
subtropical regions.
Conclusion: Lower air pressure might be the main risk factor for the incidence of
HFMD in Chinese mainland. The influence of meteorological parameters on the
prevalence of HFMD is mainly through changing virus viability in aerosols, which 
may be different in different climate regions. In an environment with low air
pressure, wearing a mask that filters the aerosol outdoors may help prevent HFMD 
infection.
