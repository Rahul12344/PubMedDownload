More than 125 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally
with rising cases in all countries since the first case was reported. A vaccine
is the best measure for the effective prevention and control of COVID-19. There
are more than 292 COVID-19 candidates' vaccines being developed as of July 2021
of which 184 are in human preclinical trials. A patent provides protection and a 
marketing monopoly to the inventor of an invention for a specified period.
Therefore, vaccine developers, including Moderna, BioNTech, Janssen, Inovio, and 
Gamaleya also filed patent applications for the protection of their vaccines.
This review aims to provide an insight into the patent literature of COVID-19
vaccines. The patent search was done using Patentscope and Espacenet databases.
The results have revealed that most of the key players have patented their
inventive COVID-19 vaccine. Many patent applications related to COVID-19 vaccines
developed via different technologies (DNA, RNA, virus, bacteria, and protein
subunit) have also been filed. The publication of a normal patent application
takes place after 18 months of its filing. Therefore, many patents/patent
applications related to the COVID-19 vaccine developed through different
technology may come into the public domain in the coming days.
