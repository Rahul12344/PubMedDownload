BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-hepatitis C virus (HCV)
co-infection is increasing due to their similar routes of transmission.
Co-infection poses a big challenge. Information on the prevalence of HCV
infection in Egyptian HIV individuals is scarce.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1004 HIV individuals who were
recruited from July 2018 to March 2019. Blood samples obtained from HIV
individuals were subsequently screened for HCV antibodies using the Murex
anti-HCV (version 4) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. HCV RNA was
performed only on anti-HCV antibody-positive samples. Logistic regression was
used to identify factors associated with HCV seroprevalence using SPSS (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS: Among 1004 participants, 349 exhibited a positive result for anti-HCV
antibodies (34.8% [95% confidence interval 31.81 to 37.8]). The most commonly
self-reported risk factor of HIV infection by the co-infected participants was
intravenous drug use (IDU) (303/349 [86.8%]). In multinomial analysis, risk
factors identified as statistically associated with HCV seroprevalence include
IDU, history of surgical operations and dental procedures and HIV viral load
(p<0.001, 0.032, <0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Under combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART), the proportion of HIV mono-infected individuals
with an undetectable HIV viral load was significantly higher than those with
co-infection (p<0.0007). We also found that HIV-HCV co-infected participants
exhibited significantly higher CD4+ cell counts than those with HIV
mono-infection (p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection is higher in Egypt compared
with other countries in Africa. It is essential to screen all HIV-infected
patients for HCV infection for early identification, counselling and initiation
of anti-HCV treatment.
