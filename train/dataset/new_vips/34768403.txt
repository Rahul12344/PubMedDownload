Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with severe acute exacerbation (SAE) is an urgent
problem requiring nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy. We aim to evaluate the
clinical relapse (CR) risk after discontinuing NA in patients with prior
SAE.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, CHB patients who discontinued NA
therapy were screened between October, 2003 and January, 2019. A total of 78
non-cirrhotic patients who had received NA therapy for CHB with SAE, i.e.,
bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL and/or prothrombin time prolongation ≥3 s, (SAE group) were
matched 1:2 with 156 controls without SAE (non-SAE group) by means of propensity 
scores (age, gender, NA categories, NA therapy duration, and HBeAg status).
RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative incidences of severe CR, i.e., ALT > 10X ULN,
(42.78%, 95% CI: 27.84-57.73% vs. 25.42%, 95% CI: 16.26-34.58%; p = 0.045) and
SAE recurrence (25.91%, 95% CI: 10.91-40.91% vs. 1.04%, 95% CI: 0-3.07%; p <
0.001) were significantly higher in the SAE group. Prior SAE history (HR 1.79,
95% CI: 1.04-3.06) was an independent factor for severe CR. The 5-year cumulative
incidence of HBsAg seroclearance was significantly higher in the SAE group than
that in the non-SAE group (16.82%, 95% CI: 2.34-31.30% vs. 6.02%, 95% CI:
0-13.23%; p = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: Even though it creates a greater chance of HBsAg seroclearance, NA
therapy cessation may result in a high risk of severe CR in non-cirrhotic CHB
patients with prior SAE.
