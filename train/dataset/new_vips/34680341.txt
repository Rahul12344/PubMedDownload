Recently, the role of exosomes in the progression of both cancer and HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) has been described. This study investigates the clinical 
significance of CD9-positive plasma exosomes in lung cancer patients, healthy
individuals, and HIV-positive patients with or without lung cancer. Using a
verified with transmission electron microscopy double-sandwich ELISA technique,
plasma-derived exosomes were isolated and quantified from 210 lung cancer
patients (including 44 metastatic patients with progressive disease after
chemotherapy), 49 healthy controls, 20 patients with pulmonary granulomas, 19
HIV+ patients with lung cancer, 31 HIV+ patients without cancer, and 3 HIV+
patients with pulmonary granulomas. Plasma exosome concentrations differed
between healthy controls, patients with immunocompetent pulmonary granulomas and 
patients with lung cancer even after chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Lung cancer
patients after chemotherapy had lower exosome concentrations compared to patients
with untreated lung cancer or granuloma (p < 0.001 for both). HIV+ patients
without lung cancer had significantly higher exosome concentrations compared to
HIV+ patients with lung cancer (p = 0.016). Although exosome concentrations
differed between all different lung cancer histologies and healthy controls (p < 
0.001 for all histologies), adjusted statistical significance was oÂµy retained
for patients with granulomas and SCLC (Small-cell lung cancer, p < 0.001).
HIV-induced immunodeficient patients with or without lung cancer had lower plasma
exosomes compared to immunocompetent granuloma and lung cancer patients (p <
0.001). Finally, higher plasma exosomes were associated both on univariate (p =
0.044), and multivariate analysis (p = 0.040) with a better 3-year survival in
stage II and III NSCLC (Non-small-cell lung carcinoma) patients. In conclusion,
our study shows that CD9-positive plasma exosomes are associated with both lung
cancer and HIV, prior chemotherapy, as well as with survival, suggesting a
possible prognostic value.
