Medical procedures can disperse infectious agents and spread disease.
Particularly, dental procedures may pose a high risk of disease transmission as
they use high-powered instruments operating within the oral cavity that may
contain infectious microbiota or viruses. Here we assess the ability of powered
dental devices in removing the biofluid films and identified mechanical,
hydrodynamic, and aerodynamic forces as the main underlying mechanisms of removal
and dispersal processes. Our results indicate that potentially infectious agents 
can be removed and dispersed immediately after dental instrument engagement with 
the adherent biofluid film, while the degree of their dispersal is rapidly
depleted owing to the removal of the source and dilution by the coolant water. We
found that droplets created by high-speed drill interactions typically travel
ballistically, while aerosol-laden air tends to flow as a current over surfaces. 
Our mechanistic investigation offers plausible routes for reducing the spread of 
infection during invasive medical procedures.
