BACKGROUND: Visceral disseminated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is a
rare but life-threatening disease. In transplant recipients with VZV infection,
visceral dissemination may develop without skin eruptions, which leads to the
failure of early diagnosis.
CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 33-year-old male renal recipient who was referred
to our hospital with severe upper abdominal pain of 3-d duration. On admission,
the patient rapidly developed septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome with liver dysfunction and acute kidney injury. Next-generation
sequencing of peripheral blood yielded 39224 sequence reads of VZV, and real-time
polymerase chain reaction for VZV was positive, with 1.2 × 107 copies/mL. The
final diagnosis was visceral disseminated VZV infection. Acyclovir and supportive
therapy were started, but the patient died of severe visceral organ damage 16 h
after admission.
CONCLUSION: Visceral disseminated VZV infection is possible in renal transplant
recipients presenting abdominal pain and rapidly-evolving organ damage without
skin involvement.
