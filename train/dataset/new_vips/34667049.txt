Herpes zoster reactivation is a frequently encountered condition that can result 
in several uncommon complications. This case report highlights one such
frequently overlooked complication, segmental zoster paresis. We discuss a case
of prolonged fever and lower limb weakness in an immunocompromised patient with
breast cancer on active chemotherapy after resolution of a herpetiform rash in
the L2, L3 and L4 dermatomes. Early investigation with lumbar puncture, looking
for cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, varicella zoster virus detection by PCR or
molecular testing and immunoglobulins against varicella zoster virus, should be
undertaken to support the diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies, electromyography
and MRI of the spine can sometimes help with neurolocalisation. Intravenous
acyclovir and a tapering course of steroids can help with resolution of symptoms.
The variegate presentation can make diagnosis challenging. Awareness and a high
index of suspicion can prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment and improve
patient outcomes.
