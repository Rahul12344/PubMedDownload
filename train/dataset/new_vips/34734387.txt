The expansion and standardization of clinical trials, as well as the use of
sensitive and specific molecular diagnostics methods, provide new information on 
the age-specific roles of influenza and other respiratory viruses in development 
of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Here, we present the results of
the multicenter hospital-based study aimed to detect age-specific impact of
influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). The 2018-2019 influenza season in 
Russia was characterized by co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) 
virus subtypes which were detected among hospitalized patients with SARI in 19.3%
and 16.4%, respectively. RSV dominated among ORV (15.1% of total cases and 26.8% 
in infants aged ≤ 2 years). The most significant SARI agents in intensive care
units were RSV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, (37.3% and 25.4%, respectively, 
of PCR-positive cases). Hyperthermia was the most frequently registered symptom
for influenza cases. In contrast, hypoxia, decreased blood O2 concentration, and 
dyspnea were registered more often in RSV, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus
infection in young children. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against
hospitalization of patients with PCR-confirmed influenza was evaluated using
test-negative case-control design. IVE for children and adults was estimated to
be 57.0% and 62.0%, respectively. Subtype specific IVE was higher against
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, compared to influenza A(H3N2) (60.3% and 45.8%,
respectively). This correlates with delayed antigenic drift of the influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and genetic heterogeneity of the influenza A(H3N2) population.
These studies demonstrate the need to improve seasonal influenza prevention and
control in all countries as states by the WHO Global Influenza Strategy for
2019-2030 initiative.
