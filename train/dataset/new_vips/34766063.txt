In the absence of a proper cure for the disease, the recent pandemic caused by
COVID-19 has been focused on isolation strategies and government measures to
control the disease, such as lockdown, media coverage, and improve public
hygiene. Mathematical models can help when these intervention mechanisms find
some optimal strategies for controlling the spread of such diseases. We propose a
set of nonlinear dynamic systems with optimal strategy including practical
measures to limit the spread of the virus and to diagnose and isolate infected
people while maintaining consciousness for citizens. We have used Pontryagin's
maximum principle and solved our system by the finite difference method. In the
end, several numerical simulations have been executed to verify the proposed
model using Matlab. Also, we pursued the resilience of the parameters of control 
of the nonlinear dynamic systems, so that we can easily handle the pandemic
situation.
