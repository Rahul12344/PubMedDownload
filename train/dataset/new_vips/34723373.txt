Drawing on the diverse perspectives of four emergency management professionals
and a public administration academic, gaps revealed by our nation's response to
the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. These gaps range from political theory
regarding our government system of federalism to fundamental questions around the
public communication of risk management and the provision of mass shelter and
care.
