Toll-like receptors (TLRs) control anti-viral responses both directly in infected
cells and in responding cells of the immune systems. Therefore, they are crucial 
for responses against the oncogenic γ-herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and the related murine virus MHV68, which
directly infect immune system cells. However, since these viruses also cause
lifelong persistent infections, TLRs may also be involved in modulation of
inflammation during latent infection and contribute to virus-driven
tumorigenesis. This review summarizes work on both of these aspects of
TLR/γ-herpesvirus interactions, as well as results showing that TLR activity can 
drive these viruses' re-entry into the replicative lytic cycle.
