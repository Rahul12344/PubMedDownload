Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are essential trace elements needed for appropriate
immune system responses, cell signalling and anti-viral defence. A
cross-sectional observational study was conducted at two hospitals in Ghent,
Belgium, to investigate whether Se and/or Zn deficiency upon hospital admission
correlates to disease severity and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with or
without co-morbidities. Trace element concentrations along with additional
biomarkers were determined in serum or plasma and associated to disease severity 
and outcome. An insufficient Se and/or Zn status upon hospital admission was
associated with a higher mortality rate and a more severe disease course in the
entire study group, especially in the senior population. In comparison to healthy
European adults, the patients displayed strongly depressed total Se (mean ± SD:
59.2 ± 20.6 vs. 84.4 ± 23.4 µg L-1) and SELENOP (mean ± SD: 2.2 ± 1.9 vs. 4.3 ±
1.0 mg L-1) concentrations at hospital admission. Particularly strong
associations were observed for death risk of cancer, diabetes and chronic cardiac
disease patients with low Se status, and of diabetes and obese patients with Zn
deficiency. A composite biomarker based on serum or plasma Se, SELENOP and Zn at 
hospital admission proved to be a reliable tool to predict severe COVID-19 course
and death, or mild disease course. We conclude that trace element assessment at
hospital admission may contribute to a better stratification of patients with
COVID-19 and other similar infectious diseases, support clinical care,
therapeutic interventions and adjuvant supplementation needs, and may prove of
particular relevance for patients with relevant comorbidities.
