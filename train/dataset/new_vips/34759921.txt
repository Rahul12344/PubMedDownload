Secondary immunodeficiency is reported in most patients with hematological
malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. The aim
of our review was to evaluate the existing literature data on patients with
hematological malignancies, with regard to the effect of immunodeficiency on the 
outcome, the clinical and therapeutic approach, and on the onset of noninfectious
complications, including thrombosis, pleural effusion, and orofacial
complications. Immunodeficiency in these patients has an intense impact on their 
risk of infection, in turn increasing morbidity and mortality even years after
treatment completion. However, these patients with increased risk of severe
infectious diseases could be treated with adequate vaccination coverage, but the 
vaccines' administration can be associated with a decreased immune response and
an augmented risk of adverse reactions. Probably, immunogenicity of the
inactivated is analogous to that of healthy subjects at the moment of
vaccination, but it undertakes a gradual weakening over time. However, the
dispensation of live attenuated viral vaccines is controversial because of the
risk of the activation of vaccine viruses. A particular immunization schedule
should be employed according to the clinical and immunological condition of each 
of these patients to guarantee a constant immune response without any risks to
the patients' health.
