Background: In Ethiopia, chronic liver disease (CLD) is the 7th leading cause of 
death, accounting for about 24 deaths per 100000 populations in 2019. Despite its
burden, there is a lack of compiled pieces of evidence on CLD in the country.
Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis is intended to provide the pooled 
estimates of CLD etiologies and mortality rate in CLD patients in Ethiopia.
Method: PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, institutional repositories,
national digital library, and the bibliography of the eligible articles
information were the source of data for the present review. The keywords
"hepatitis, chronic" [Mesh], "end-Stage Liver Disease" [Mesh], "chronic liver
disease", "liver cirrhosis" [Mesh], and "Ethiopia" were used for the searches.
Overall, we retrieved 199 records and 12 were included in this review. We used
the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models to perform the meta-analysis. We
conducted subgroup and meta-regression analyses to account for the heterogeneity 
of the estimates.
Result: Hepatitis B virus, alcohol, and hepatitis C virus are the three most
common etiologies of CLD in Ethiopia accounting for a pooled estimate of 40.0%
[95% CI: 29.0, 51.0, I 2 = 96.3, p < 0.001], 17.0% [95% CI: 9.0, 25.0, I
2 = 96.7, p < 0.001], and 15.0% [95% CI: 9.0, 21.0, I 2 = 95.8, p < 0.001],
respectively. Unidentified etiology report has a substantial contribution
accounting for an estimated pooled proportion of 45% [95% CI: 34.0, 56.0%,
Q = 32.08, p < 0.001, I 2 = 87.53] of the CLD cases in the country. On the other 
hand, the overall hospital mortality rate in CLD patients is 25.0% [95% CI: 2.0, 
47.0, I2 = 94.6, p < 0.001] in Ethiopia.
Conclusion: Hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and alcohol are the three most 
common contributors to CLD cases in Ethiopia. The authors warrant routine
screening and strengthening of preventive and treatment programs for viral
hepatitis B and C, further enhancing the alcohol policy of the country.
