Responding to measles outbreaks in the United States puts a considerable strain
on public health resources, and limited research exists about the effectiveness
of containment strategies. In this paper we quantify the impact of isolation,
contact tracing, and exclusion in reducing transmission during a measles outbreak
in an under-vaccinated community.
