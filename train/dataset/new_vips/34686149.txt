BACKGROUND: The high risk of cross-infection during tracheal intubation has
caused excessive occupational anxiety for anaesthesiologists amid the novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is no effective
way to attenuate their anxiety in clinical practice. We found that
anaesthesiologist with better protective equipment might experience decreased
levels of anxiety during intubation.
METHODS: In this study, 60 patients who underwent intubation and extubation in
the operating room were enrolled, and then randomized 1:1 to either wear
protective sleeves (protective sleeve group) or not (control group). Visual
analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure the anxiety level of anaesthesiologists 
during intubation. The respiratory droplets of patients on the sleeve, and the
anaesthesiologists' perception including the patient's oral malodour, exertion,
satisfaction degree, waist discomfort and shoulder discomfort were recorded. The 
patients' anxiety, oppressed feelings and hypoxia and postoperative complications
were all measured and recorded.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the anaesthesiologists in protective
sleeve group achieved lower anxiety scores and better satisfaction degrees during
the process of intubation and extubation (all P < 0.05). Respiratory droplets
were observed only on the inner side, but not the external side, of the
protective sleeves (P < 0.001). The incidence of the anaesthesiologists'
perception of patients' oral malodour was significantly lower in the protective
sleeve group (P = 0.02) and no patients developed hypoxemia or intubation-related
complications in the protective sleeve group.
CONCLUSION: Using protective devices for intubation might eliminate droplet
transmission from patients to anaesthesiologists, while also decreasing their
anxiety in a controlled operating room environment.
