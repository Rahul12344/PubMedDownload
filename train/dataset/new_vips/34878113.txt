The English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, is a major agricultural pest of wheat, 
barley and oats, and one of the principal vectors of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus
(BYDV) leading to significant reductions in grain yield, annually. Emerging
resistance to and increasing regulation of insecticides has resulted in limited
options for their control. Using PacBio HiFi data, we have produced a high
quality draft assembly of the S. avenae genome; generating a primary assembly
with a total assembly size of 475.7 Mb, and an alternate assembly with a total
assembly size of 430.8 Mb. Our primary assembly was highly contiguous with only
326 contigs and a contig N50 of 15.95 Mb. Assembly completeness was estimated at 
97.7% using BUSCO analysis and 31,007 and 29,037 protein coding genes were
predicted from the primary and alternate assemblies, respectively. This assembly,
which is to our knowledge the first for an insecticide resistant clonal lineage
of English grain aphid, will provide novel insight into the molecular and
mechanistic determinants of resistance and will facilitate future research into
mechanisms of viral transmission and aphid behavior.
