Bracoviruses (BVs) and ichnoviruses (IVs) evolved from different endogenized
viruses but through convergence have been coopted by parasitoids in the families 
Braconidae and Ichneumonidae for similar functions in parasitizing hosts.
Experimentally studying the role of endogenized viral genes in virion
morphogenesis remains a key challenge in the study of BVs and IVs. Here we
summarize how multiomics, electron microscopy, and RNA interference (RNAi)
methods have provided new insights about BV and IV gene function.
