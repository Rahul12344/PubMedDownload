BACKGROUND: Chlorine dioxide has been promoted as an alternative for the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in Peru, despite the lack of
evidence to support its efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the factors
associated with chlorine dioxide consumption in the Peruvian population.
METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study. An adult Peruvian population was
evaluated where chlorine dioxide consumption was divided into two groups
according to the purpose of use: as prevention (individuals without COVID-19
history) and as treatment (individuals with COVID-19 history). The associated
factors in each group were evaluated using Poisson regressions with the
bootstrapping resampling method.
RESULTS: Of 3610 participants included, 3213 reported no history of COVID-19, and
397 had been infected. The prevalence of chlorine dioxide consumption to prevent 
or treat COVID-19 was 8 and 16%, respectively. Factors either positively or
negatively associated with chlorine dioxide consumption for prevention were male 
sex (aPR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.09-1.71), being an adult or older adult (aPR: 0.54; 95%
CI: 0.35-0.82), having a health sciences student within the family unit (aPR:
1.38; 95% CI: 1.02-1.87), using medical information as the main source of
information of COVID-19 (aPR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40-0.80), having comorbidities for 
COVID-19 (aPR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01-1.82), considering COVID-19 dangerous and
deadly (aPR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45-0.74), using medications (aPR: 1.59; 95% CI:
1.25-2.06) and plants to prevent COVID-19 (aPR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.21-2.36),
considering chlorine dioxide ineffective (aPR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.18-0.24), and
being uninformed of its efficacy (aPR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16-0.28). In addition,
factors associated with chlorine dioxide consumption for treatment were
considering COVID-19 dangerous and deadly (aPR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.96),
considering chlorine dioxide ineffective (aPR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.12-0.42), and
being uninformed of its efficacy (aPR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.07-0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of chlorine dioxide consumption to treat COVID-19 was
higher than prevent. It is important to apply information strategies,
prioritizing population groups with certain characteristics that are associated
with a higher consumption pattern.
