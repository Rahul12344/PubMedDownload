Rural environments lack basic sanitation services. Facilities for obtaining water
and disposing sewage are often under the initiative of each resident, who may not
be able to build and maintain them properly. Thus, water for human consumption is
subject to fecal contamination and, consequently, the presence of waterborne
pathogens, such as enteric viruses. This study evaluated fecal contamination of
water samples from individual sources used for domestic water supply on small
farms in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Samples were collected from 78 houses whose 
water sources were tubular wells, dug wells, springs, and surface waters.
Escherichia coli (EC) bacteria, analyzed by the defined chromogenic substrate
method, was used as a traditional indicator of fecal contamination. The enteric
viruses Human mastadenovirus (HAdV) and Enterovirus (EV), analyzed by qPCR, were 
tested as complementary indicators of fecal contamination. At least one of these 
markers was found in 89.7% of the samples. Detection rates were 79.5% for EC,
52.6% for HAdV, and 5.1% for EV. The average concentration for EC was 8.82 × 101 
most probable number (MPN) per 100 mL, while for HAdV and EV the concentrations
were 7.51 × 105 and 1.89 × 106 genomic copies (GC) per liter, respectively. EC
was the most frequent marker in ground and surface water samples. HAdV was
detected significantly more frequently in groundwater than in surface water and
was more efficient in indicating contamination in tubular wells. There was no
association of frequencies or correlation of concentrations between EC and HAdV. 
HAdV indicated human fecal contamination and performed well as a complementary
indicator. The results reveal that a large part of the analyzed population is
vulnerable to waterborne diseases caused by enteric pathogens.
