The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to ravage the world, posing great
challenges to the public health system and threatening the health and survival of
humans. The outbreak of COVID-19 leaves us with much to reflect on and calls on
our attention to respiratory infectious diseases, especially new outbreaks of
respiratory infectious diseases that are zoonotic. The importance of identifying 
viral pathogens should be highlighted because it is related to the prevention and
treatment strategy of childhood pneumonia. Due to the highly infectious nature of
COVID-19, the rapid mutation of the virus, and the lack of specific drugs,
vaccines are currently the most effective means of prevention, and a global
immune barrier must be established as soon as possible.
