Little has been published on successful leadership models within integrated care 
systems. Within East Toronto Health Partners, there have been considerable
efforts at the executive leadership level to empower local leadership,
particularly physician leaders, to develop and execute effective solutions across
the community. What does distributed leadership look like, and what does it take 
to implement it? A number of activities demonstrating the impact of a distributed
leadership model in East Toronto are outlined in this paper, offering an
effective defence against the enormous challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
