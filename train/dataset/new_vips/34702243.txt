BACKGROUND: The SARS-COV-2 pandemic provides a natural intervention to assess
practical priority setting and internal evaluation of specific health services,
such as radiological services. Norway makes an excellent case as it had a very
low infection rate and very few cases of COVID-19. Accordingly, the objective of 
this study is to use the changes in performed outpatient radiological
examinations during the first stages of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic to assess the
practical evaluation of specific radiological examinations in Norway.
METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from the Norwegian Health Economics
Administration (HELFO) in the years 2015-2020. Data included the number of
performed outpatient imaging examinations at public hospitals and private imaging
centers in Norway and was divided in to three periods based on the level of
restrictions on elective health services. Results were analyzed with descriptive 
statistics.
RESULTS: In the first period there was a 45% reduction in outpatient radiology
compared to the same time period in 2015-2019 while in period 2 and 3 there was a
25 and 6% reduction respectively. The study identified a list of specific
potential low-value radiological examinations. While some of these are covered by
the Choosing Wisely campaign, others are not.
CONCLUSION: By studying the priority setting practice during the initial phases
of the pandemic this study identifies a set of potential low value radiological
examinations during the initial phases of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. These
examinations are candidates for closer assessments for health services quality
improvement.
