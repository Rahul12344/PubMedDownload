BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interferon-β, as with several other anti-viral agents, 
has been investigated as a treatment option for COVID-19 as a repurposed drug.
The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of interferon-β to
determine its efficacy among moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was done using relevant terms for
'COVID-19' and 'interferon-β'. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the 
efficacy of interferon-β in COVID-19 were included. Data were extracted for
outcome measures, namely mortality, time to clinical improvement and length of
hospital stay. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan V.5.4.1 to
calculate overall effect estimate as odds ratio/hazard ratio for categorical
variables and mean difference for continuous variable.
RESULT: Eight RCTs were eligible for qualitative synthesis and seven for
meta-analysis. The overall effect estimate (odds ratio [OR] 0.59; 95 % CI 0.91,
1.12) and (mean difference [MD] - 1.41; 95 % CI - 2.84, 0.02) indicated no
statistically significant difference between effect of IFN-β and that of control 
on mortality and length of hospital stay, respectively. However, the overall
effect estimate (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95; 95 % CI 1.36, 2.79) denoted a favourable
effect of INF-β on reducing the time to clinical improvement in
moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSION: Addition of interferon-β to standard of care resulted in significant 
reduction in time to clinical improvement but no significant benefit in terms of 
reduction in mortality and length of hospital stay in moderate-to-severe cases of
COVID-19.
