OBJECTIVE: Hyperamylasemia was found in a group of patients with COVID-19 during 
hospitalization. However, the evolution and the clinical significance of
hyperamylasemia in COVID-19, is not well characterized.
DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, the epidemiological, demographic,
laboratory, treatment and outcome information of 1,515 COVID-19 patients with
available longitudinal amylase records collected from electronic medical system
were analyzed to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of
hyperamylasemia in this infection. Associated variables with hyperamylasemia in
COVID-19 were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 1,515 patients, 196 (12.9%) developed hyperamylasemia, among whom 19 
(1.3%) greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and no clinical acute
pancreatitis was seen. Multivariable ordered logistic regression implied older
age, male, chronic kidney disease, several medications (immunoglobin, systemic
corticosteroids, and antifungals), increased creatinine might be associated with 
hyperamylasemia during hospitalization. Restricted cubic spline analysis
indicated hyperamylasemia had a J-shaped association with all-cause mortality and
the estimated hazard ratio per standard deviation was 2.85 (2.03-4.00) above ULN.
Based on the multivariable mixed-effect cox or logistic regression model taking
hospital sites as random effects, elevated serum amylase during hospitalization
was identified as an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital death
and intensive complications, including sepsis, cardiac injury, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum amylase was independently associated with adverse
clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Since early intervention might change the
outcome, serum amylase should be monitored dynamically during hospitalization.
