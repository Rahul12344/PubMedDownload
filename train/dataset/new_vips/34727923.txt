BACKGROUND: The number of SARS-CoV-2 tests conversely to other factors, such as
age of population or comorbidities, influencing SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and fatality
rates, can be increased or decreased by decision makers depending on the
development of the pandemic, operational capacity, and financial restraints. The 
key objective of this study is to identify and describe, within the probabilistic
approach, the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 test numbers and the mortality and
morbidity rates.
METHODS: The study is based on a statistical analysis of 1058 monthly
observations relating to 107 countries, from six different continents, in an
11-month period from March 2020 to January 2021. The variable utilised can be
defined as the number of tests performed in a given country in 1 month, to the
number of cases reported in a prior month and morbidities and mortalities per 1
million population. The probabilities of different mortality and morbidity rates 
for different test numbers were determined by moving percentiles and fitted by
the power law and by the three-segment piecewise-linear approximation based on
Theil Sen trend lines.
RESULTS: We have identified that for a given probability the dependence of
mortality and morbidity rates on SARS-CoV-2 test rates follows a power law and it
is well approximated by the three Theil Sen trend lines in the three test rate
ranges. In all these ranges Spearman rho and Kendall tau-b rank correlation
coefficients of test numbers and morbidity with fatality rates have values
between - 0.5 and - 0.12 with p-values below 0.002.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the ABC classification: the most important, moderately 
important, and relatively unimportant ranges of test numbers for managing and
control have been indicated based on the value of the Theil Sen trend line slope 
in the three SARS-CoV-2 test rate ranges identified. Recommendations for
SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy are provided.
