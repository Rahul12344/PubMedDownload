Efficient disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease, the most common
form of dementia, have yet to be established. Gene therapy has the potential to
provide the long-term production of therapeutic in the brain following a single
administration. However, the blood-brain barrier poses a challenge for gene
delivery to the adult brain. We investigated the transduction efficiency and
immunological response following non-invasive gene-delivery strategies to the
brain of a mouse model of amyloidosis. Two emerging technologies enabling gene
delivery across the blood-brain barrier were used to establish the minimal vector
dosage required to reach the brain: (1) focused ultrasound combined with
intravenous microbubbles, which increases the permeability of the blood-brain
barrier at targeted sites and (2) the recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV)-based capsid named rAAV-PHP.B. We found that equal intravenous dosages of 
rAAV9 combined with focused ultrasound, or rAAV-PHP.B, were required for brain
gene delivery. In contrast to rAAV9, focused ultrasound did not decrease the
rAAV-PHP.B dosage required to transduce brain cells in a mouse model of
amyloidosis. The non-invasive rAAV delivery to the brain using rAAV-PHP.B or
rAAV9 with focused ultrasound triggered an immune reaction including major
histocompatibility complex class II expression, complement system and microglial 
activation, and T cell infiltration.
