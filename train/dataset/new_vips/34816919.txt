OBJECTIVE: Psychological effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic on pregnant women with diabetes and hypertension are not yet studied.
Besides the pregnancy, these women have additional risk factors for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19 and are considered a particularly
vulnerable, unique population. We aimed to assess their mental health during this
pandemic.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out at a Brazilian tertiary
hospital. Women with pregnancies complicated by hypertension and/or diabetes were
evaluated. The primary outcome was anxiety, and depressive symptoms evaluated
with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire.
Perception of changing habits during quarantine was evaluated as a secondary
outcome.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were included. The prevalence of State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory ≥40 was 79.7% and that of Patient Health Questionnaire ≥10 was 
59.2%. Lower social support was correlated with higher scores on both scales.
Time spent with electronic devices was perceived as greater by 62% of the women.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with diabetes and hypertension presented high levels 
of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that
these symptoms can affect both the mother's and offspring's health, it is
necessary to implement tools to improve their mental health.
