The interaction of microbiota with its host has the ability to alter the cellular
functions of both, through several mechanisms. Recent work, from many
laboratories including our own, has shown that epigenetic mechanisms play an
important role in the alteration of these cellular functions. Epigenetics broadly
refers to change in the phenotype without a corresponding change in the DNA
sequence. This change is usually brought by epigenetic modifications of the DNA
itself, the histone proteins associated with the DNA in the chromatin, non-coding
RNA or the modifications of the transcribed RNA. These modifications, also known 
as epigenetic code, do not change the DNA sequence but alter the expression level
of specific genes. Microorganisms seem to have learned how to modify the host
epigenetic code and modulate the host transcriptome in their favour. In this
review, we explore the literature that describes the epigenetic interaction of
bacteria, fungi and viruses, with their mammalian hosts.
