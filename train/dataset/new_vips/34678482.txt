As long as critical levels of vaccination have not been reached to ensure heard
immunity, and new SARS-CoV-2 strains are developing, the only realistic way to
reduce the infection speed in a population is to track the infected individuals
before they pass on the virus. Testing the population via sampling has shown good
results in slowing the epidemic spread. Sampling can be implemented at different 
times during the epidemic and may be done either per individual or for combined
groups of people at a time. The work we present here makes two main
contributions. We first extend and refine our scalable agent-based COVID-19
simulator to incorporate an improved socio-demographic model which considers
professions, as well as a more realistic population mixing model based on contact
matrices per country. These extensions are necessary to develop and test various 
sampling strategies in a scenario including the 62 largest cities in Spain; this 
is our second contribution. As part of the evaluation, we also analyze the impact
of different parameters, such as testing frequency, quarantine time, percentage
of quarantine breakers, or group testing, on sampling efficacy. Our results show 
that the most effective strategies are pooling, rapid antigen test campaigns, and
requiring negative testing for access to public areas. The effectiveness of all
these strategies can be greatly increased by reducing the number of contacts for 
infected individual.
