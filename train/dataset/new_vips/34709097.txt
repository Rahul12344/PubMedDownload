Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) affects both commercial poultry as well as other
avian species in the wild and in captivity. Although the diversity of NDV in
domestic chickens has been well understood, little light has been shed on NDV
outbreaks in other avian species. We provide an annotated sequence of
NDV/Owl/Guwahati/01/20, a virulent strain of NDV isolated from Barn Owls in
captivity from Guwahati in Northeast India. The complete genome is 15192 bases
long with a fusion protein (F) cleavage site 112KRQKRâ†“F117. The isolate showed
97.67% identity with its closest match, another highly virulent strain from
Indonesia isolated from vaccinated commercial chickens; however, they differ in
the F cleavage site. The NDV isolate from the owl shares 83.02% and 81.88%
identity with the vaccine strains R2B and LaSota, respectively. Phylogenetic
analysis with both F gene as well as whole-genome nucleotide sequence reveals
that the NDV isolate from owl belongs to genotype VII, subgenotype VII.2 and
differs significantly from any other isolate of NDV from India.
