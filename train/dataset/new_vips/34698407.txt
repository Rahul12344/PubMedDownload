While most of the spontaneous mutations in the viral genome have no functional,
diagnostic, or clinical consequences, some have. In February 2021, we noticed in 
Southern Finland coronavirus disease 2019 cases where two commercial polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analyses failed to recognize the used N gene target but
recognized the other target gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2. Complete viral genome sequence analysis of the strains revealed several
mutations that were not found at that time in public databases. A short 3 bp
deletion and three subsequent single nucleotide polymorphisms in the N gene were 
found exactly at the site where an early published and widely used N gene-based
PCR primer is located, explaining the negative results in the N gene PCR. Later
the variant strain was identified as a member of the B.1.1.318 Pango lineage that
had first been found from Nigerian samples collected in January 2021. This strain
shares with the Beta variant the S gene E484K mutation linked to impaired vaccine
protection, but differs from this variant in several other ways, for example by
deletions in the N gene region. Mutations in the N gene causing diagnostic
resistance and on the other hand E484K mutation in the causing altered
infectivity warrants careful inspection on virus variants that might get
underdiagnosed.
