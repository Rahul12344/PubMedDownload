SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials assess efficacy against disease (VEDIS), the
ability to block symptomatic COVID-19. They only partially discriminate whether
VEDIS is mediated by preventing infection completely, which is defined as
detection of virus in the airways (VESUSC), or by preventing symptoms despite
infection (VESYMP). Vaccine efficacy against transmissibility given infection
(VEINF), the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine
recipients, is also not measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King
County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna (mRNA-1273QS) and
Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines, which demonstrated VEDIS > 90% in clinical
trials, mediate VEDIS by VESUSC, then a limited fourth epidemic wave of
infections with the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant would have been predicted
in spring 2021 assuming rapid vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained by
VESYMP, then high VEINF would have also been necessary to limit the extent of
this fourth wave. Vaccines which completely protect against infection or
secondary transmission also substantially lower the number of people who must be 
vaccinated before the herd immunity threshold is reached. The limited extent of
the fourth wave suggests that the vaccines have either high VESUSC or both high
VESYMP and high VEINF against B.1.1.7. Finally, using a separate intra-host
mathematical model of viral kinetics, we demonstrate that a 0.6 log
vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to
achieve 50% VEINF, which suggests that human challenge studies with a relatively 
low number of infected participants could be employed to estimate all three
vaccine efficacy metrics.
