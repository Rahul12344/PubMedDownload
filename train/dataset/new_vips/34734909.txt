INTRODUCTION: In the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are vulnerable to
develop COVID-19 due to the immunosuppressive therapy. The objective of this
study is to describe a known case of NMOSD on rituximab who experienced 2
episodes of COVID-19.
CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old woman, a known case of NMOSD on rituximab was
diagnosed with asymptomatic COVID-19. Eight months later, following her last
infusion of rituximab, she developed moderate COVID-19. After a partial recovery,
she exhibited exacerbation of respiratory symptoms leading to readmission and
invasive oxygenation. She was eventually discharged home after 31 days. Her
monthly neurological evaluation did not reveal evidence of disease activity. She 
later received intravenous immunoglobulin and the decision was made to start
rituximab again.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises the possibility of persistent virus shedding and
reactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in a patient with
NMOSD and rituximab therapy. We aimed to emphasize a precise consideration of
management of patients with NMOSD during the COVID-19 pandemic.
