Ongoing pandemic and potential resurgence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
has prompted urgent efforts to investigate the immunological memory of
convalescent patients, especially in patients with active cancers. Here we
performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 3 healthy
donors (HDs), 4 COVID-19 patients (Covs) and 4 COVID-19 patients with active
gynecological tumor (TCs) pre- and post- anti-tumor treatment. All Covs patients 
had recovered from their acute infection. Interestingly, the molecular features
of PBMCs in TCs are similar to that in Covs, suggesting that convalescent
COVID-19 with gynecologic tumors do not have major immunological changes and may 
be protected against reinfection similar to COVID-19 patients without tumors.
Moreover, the chemotherapy given to these patients mainly caused neutropenia,
while having little effect on the proportion and functional phenotype of T and B 
cells, and T cell clonal expansion. Notably, anti-PD-L1 treatment massively
increased cytotoxic scores of NK cells, and T cells, and facilitated clonal
expansion of T cells in these patients. It is likely that T cells could protect
patients from SARS-CoV-2 virus reinfection and anti-PD-L1 treatment can enhance
the anti-viral activity of the T cells.
