Background: Laboratory viral nucleic acid testing (NAT), such as the
nasopharyngeal swab test, is now recommended as the gold standard for the
diagnosis of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, the nasopharyngeal
swab testing process may cause some discomfort.
Objective: To investigate the influence of nasopharyngeal swab tests on the
anxiety and pain felt by psychiatric medical staff.
Methods: A total of 174 psychiatric medical staff (namely 97 doctors, 68 nurses, 
and nine administrators) and 27 controls were included in the current study. A
self-designed questionnaire was used to collect their general demographic
information (age, gender, marriage, occupation, profession, smoking history,
alcohol consumption history, tea drinking history, previous history of anxiety
and depression) as well as their subjective experience, such as nausea, vomiting,
coughing, worry, fear, etc, during nasopharyngeal swab collection. The Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to
assess the subjects' pain and state anxiety, respectively.
Results: There were no statistical differences (p>0.05) in age, marriage, smoking
history, a history of anxiety and depression, pain scores, and anxiety scores
between different professions and genders. The results of partial correlation
analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated
that the male gender was negatively correlated with being anxious (r=-0.148,
p=0.037) and nervous (r=-0.171 p=0.016), although there was no significant
difference in pain and anxiety between men and women. In addition, marriage might
help women resist negative emotions.
Conclusions: 1) There will be mild discomfort during nucleic acid testing, but
not enough to cause pain and anxiety; 2) women are more likely to be anxious and 
nervous during the nucleic acid testing.
