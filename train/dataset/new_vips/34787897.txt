The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei province of
China) has given rise to a pandemic spread of virus, more than 240 million
incidences and a death toll larger than 5 million people. COVID-19 has set off
large efforts in research, therapy and patient care, as well as public and
private debates in every imaginable form. A number of scientists used the
publication platforms provided by the Federation of the European Biochemical
Societies (FEBS) to present their research data, reviews, opinions and other
contributions relating to COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, I highlight the recent COVID-19 papers which
have been published and collected in a Virtual Issue in FEBS Letters, and discuss
their implications towards understanding the molecular, biochemical and cellular 
mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccine development and antiviral discovery 
strategies.
