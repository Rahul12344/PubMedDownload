BACKGROUND: Migrants face multiple barriers to accessing health services and
antiretroviral therapy (ART). We tested the hypothesis that HIV-infected
ART-experienced Mexicans with a history of residence in the U.S. have a higher
rate of viral drug-resistance associated mutations (RAMs) versus those without
such a history.
METHODS: Viral genotypic resistance tests obtained from 336 HIV-infected Mexican 
patients throughout the country were analysed for the presence of viral-RAMs and 
its rate was compared between migrants and non-migrants. Adjustment for potential
confounders was done though a multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Eighty-four Mexicans who had lived for at least 3 months in the U.S.
were more likely to have three or more protease inhibitor (PI)-major RAMs
(aOR = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.06-5.76; p < 0.05) than in 252 individuals without this
background, independently of the time spent on ART.
CONCLUSIONS: A migration background is associated with a higher likelihood of the
emergence of HIV variants with decreased susceptibility to several PI.
