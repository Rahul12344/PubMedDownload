BACKGROUND: Replication of the influenza A viruses occurs in the cells through
the viral RdRP consisting of PB1, PB2, and PA. Several cellular proteins are
involved in these processes. This study aims to reveal the interaction between
human SNX2 protein and the PA protein and the effects of the SNX2 on the virus
replication.
RESULTS: To identify potential host interacting proteins to the PA, yeast
two-hybrid assay was carried out with HEK293 cell cDNA library and the PA as a
bait. We focused on SNX2 protein, which interacts with the PA in the yeast cells.
By using the co-immunoprecipitation assays, it has been demonstrated that the
amino-terminal part of the PA was important for binding to the SNX2.
Immunolocalization of the proteins in HeLa cells supported this interaction.
Knockdown of the SNX2 with siRNA in the cells resulted in a significant increase 
in both viral transcripts and virus growth. However, the increase of SNX2 in
transfected cells didn't cause a significant change in the viral RdRP activity in
minireplicon assay. This may suggest that the negative effect of SNX2 on the
virus replication could be saturated with its authentic intra-cellular amount.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the SNX2 and PA protein interact with each 
other in both yeast and HEK293 cells, and the SNX2 has a negative regulatory
function on the virus replication. However, more knowledge is required to
elucidate the action mechanism of the SNX2 on the influenza A virus replication
at the molecular level.
