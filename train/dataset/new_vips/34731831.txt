Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is a neglected tropical disease caused by
penetration of female sand fleas, Tunga penetrans, into a person's skin usually
in their feet. The disease inflicts immense pain and suffering on millions of
people, particularly children. The condition is most prevalent in Latin America, 
the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is no standard drug
treatment for tungiasis. The available treatment options are fairly limited and
unrealistic to use in endemic areas; as a result, in desperation, the affected
people do more harm to themselves by extracting the fleas with non-sterile
instruments, further exposing themselves to secondary bacterial infections and/or
transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or HIV.
This highlights the urgent need for simpler, safer, and effective treatment
options for tungiasis. Tea tree oil (TTO) has long been used as an antiseptic
with extensive safety and efficacy data. The evidence on parasiticidal properties
of TTO against ectoparasites such as head lice, mites, and fleas is also
compelling. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current tungiasis
treatment challenges in endemic settings and highlight the potential role of TTO 
in the treatment of tungiasis.
