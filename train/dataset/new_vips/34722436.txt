Purpose: There is limited information about the association between workplace
psychosocial factors and general worker mental health status during the COVID-19 
pandemic. In the present study, we examined how anxiety about being infected by
COVID-19 in the workplace affected the association between job demands and
psychological distress (PD). Method: A cross-sectional online survey was
conducted in December 2020. The final analyzed sample was 27,036. The dependent
variable of PD was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). 
Job demands were assessed using the Job Content Questionnaire. Feelings of
anxiety were assessed by participants' responses to the following question: "Do
you feel anxiety about being infected by COVID-19 in the workplace?" We used a
two-level regression adjusting for prefectural level: each individual-level
variable at level 1 was nested into each prefecture at level 2, stratified by
presence of anxiety. Results: A total of 50.5% of participants felt anxious about
being infected by COVID-19 in the workplace. The interaction between anxiety and 
job demands was significant. Job demands were positively associated with PD. In
the stratified analysis, the associations were stronger among employees who
experienced anxiety about COVID-19 infection in the workplace than among those
who did not. Conclusion: The association between job demands and PD may be
strengthened by anxiety about COVID-19 infection in the workplace.
