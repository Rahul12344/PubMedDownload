Despite vaccination, a substantial proportion of immunocompromised patients have 
an increased risk for severe Covid-19. Treatment with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies has been shown to be safe and can prevent Covid-19
associated hospitalization and death. Monoclonal antibodies neutralize the virus 
and promote the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Treatment with monoclonal
antibodies is a potential breakthrough for the treatment of patients who are at
high risk for severe disease when given early after infection. The first
encouraging clinical trial data and the imminent availability of combination
antibody therapy create a "momentum" to address several essential questions that 
are necessary to address for the structural use of this treatment in routine
clinical care. These concern the real-world effect and sustainability of
treatment of vulnerable patients, the optimal logistics and the
cost-effectiveness of these novel compounds.
