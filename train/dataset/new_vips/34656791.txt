The gut microbiome includes a series of microorganism genomes, such as
bacteriome, virome, mycobiome, etc. The gut microbiota is critically involved in 
intestine immunity and diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely
understood. Clarifying the relationship between microbiota and inflammation may
profoundly improve our understanding of etiology, disease progression, patient
management, and the development of prevention and treatment. In this review, we
discuss the latest studies of the influence of enteric viruses (i.e., commensal
viruses, pathogenic viruses, and bacteriophages) in the initiation, progression, 
and complication of colitis and colorectal cancer, and their potential for novel 
preventative approaches and therapeutic application. We explore the interplay
between gut viruses and host immune systems for its effects on the severity of
inflammatory diseases and cancer, including both direct and indirect interactions
between enteric viruses with other microbes and microbial products. Furthermore, 
the underlying mechanisms of the virome's roles in gut inflammatory response have
been explained to infer potential therapeutic targets with examples in specific
clinical trials. Given that very limited literature has thus far discussed these 
various topics with the gut virome, we believe these extensive analyses may
provide insight into the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD and
CRC, which could help add the design of improved therapies for these important
human diseases.
