INTRODUCTION: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at risk of severe
coronavirus disease and mortality. Immunogenicity of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) inactivated whole-virus vaccine in patients
with ESKD has never been explored.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 60 patients with ESKD and 30 
healthy controls. All participants received two doses of an inactivated
whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Sinovac Biotech Ltd) 4 weeks apart.
SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were investigated 
and referenced with healthy controls.
RESULTS: After two doses, an anti-receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G of
50 AU/ml or greater was present in 53 of 60 patients (88%) in the ESKD group and 
all participants (100%) in the control group (P = 0.05). The percentage of
patients with ESKD and controls with neutralizing antibodies of 35% threshold or 
greater was 58% and 88%, respectively (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the proportion of 
patients with ESKD and S1-specific T cell response was comparable with controls
(82% vs. 77%, P = 0.45). Old age, high ferritin level, and low absolute
lymphocyte count were independently associated with poor humoral immune
responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESKD could develop similar SARS-CoV-2-specific
cell-mediated immune responses compared to healthy controls, although suboptimal 
humoral immune responses were observed following two doses of SARS-CoV-2
vaccination. Therefore, patients with ESKD and the abovementioned factors are at 
risk of generating inadequate humoral immune responses, and a vaccine strategy to
elicit greater immunogenicity among these relatively immunocompromised patients
is warranted. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry, TCTR20210226002).
