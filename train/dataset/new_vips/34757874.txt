Athletes.

Yao KV, Szybinski S, Varghese M, Fazekas M.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to forefront the
large morbidity, mortality, and complications that viral illnesses can cause. For
athletes, viral illnesses can be disruptive toward their participation in youth
sports. This article outlines the details of how the most common viral illnesses 
affect the youth athlete and youth sports, including COVID-19, non-COVID-19 upper
respiratory infections, influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella, herpes, and
other dermatologic infections. In this article, we review current available
guidelines and recommendations on how to handle these infections in athletes
during sports as well as return-to-play recommendations. [Pediatr Ann.
