Background: In Ethiopia, multidrug resistant tuberculosis is a major public
health problem. However, information is scarce regarding MDR-TB and associated
factors.
Objective: The study was aimed to assess the magnitude of multidrug resistance
and associated factors of pulmonary tuberculosis among adult smear-positive
patients in Harari regional state health facilities, eastern Ethiopia.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 395 adult smear-positive
pulmonary tuberculosis patients attending health facilities from March to October
2019. Smear-positive sputum samples were collected from health facilities, and
transported to Harari Health Research and Regional Laboratory, and tested for
drug susceptibility using a line probe assay. Data were analyzed using
Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Bivariate and multivariable
logistic regression analyses with 95% confidence intervals were carried out to
identify factors associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
Results: The overall magnitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was 3.8%
(15/395) (95% CI: 2.0-5.8%). Being male (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.16, 20.5), patients
with a previous history of tuberculosis (AOR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.5, 29.6), treatment
failure (AOR = 8.5; 95% CI: 1.61, 45.3), treatment default (AOR = 10.38; 95% CI: 
1.86, 58.0), human immunodeficiency virus co-infection (AOR = 9.83.95% CI: 3, 21,
30.1) and a previous history of contact with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
patients (AOR = 14.4; 95% CI: 3.1, 67.6) had higher odds of multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis.
Conclusion: The overall magnitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was high.
Strengthening the tuberculosis control program by giving special attention to HIV
co-infected patients,  treatment failure and default, previously infected
patients as well as to those individuals who have a history of contact with
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis infected patients .
