In early 2021, roughly six months after the H7N9 H7-Re3 and H7N9 rLN79 vaccine
strains were introduced into China, we monitored a number of H7N9 subtype avian
influenza viruses, which could have escaped vaccine-induced immunity in live
poultry markets (LPMs) in Yunnan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Guangdong provinces, China. 
To investigate whether these viruses were a novel H7N9 variant of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus and whether they had the potential for
further spread, we characterized the genetic evolution, antigenic divergence, and
pathogenicity of the viruses in the context of vaccine immunity. The results show
further diversification in the HA gene of newly isolated HPAI H7N9 viruses
compared with antigenic variants that emerged after the period of 2017-2019.
There were clear antigenic differences between current vaccines and these
viruses, and SPF broilers under vaccine protection could not resist virus
challenges. Our study demonstrates that the current vaccine has insufficient
protective capacity against the novel H7N9 variants under experimental
conditions. A novel H7N9 immune escape virus has emerged. Faced with potential
outbreaks, we should strengthen surveillance and update vaccine strains. This
