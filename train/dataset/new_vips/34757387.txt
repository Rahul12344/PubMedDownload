Importance: Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on
human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear.
Objective: To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and
microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with
infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or
vaccination.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Convenience sampling observational cohort
(recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human 
milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and
90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human
milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days
after the second dose.
Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14
days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or 
mRNA-1273).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain
IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD]
age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD]
age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P = .002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection
and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively
(P < .001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG
receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified 
into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45
participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection 
was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable
out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform
IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and 
beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated
with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase,
31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination
exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased
throughout time in the vaccine group only (median [IQR], 2.2 [0] before vaccine
vs 10 [4.0] after the first dose; P = .003) but was higher in the infection group
(median [IQR], 20 [67] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose
human milk samples (P = .002). Both IgA and non-IgA (IgG-containing) fractions of
human milk from both participants with infection and those who were vaccinated
exhibited microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of a convenience sample of
lactating parents, the pattern of IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk differed
between COVID-19 infection vs mRNA vaccination out to 90 days. While infection
was associated with a highly variable IgA-dominant response and vaccination was
associated with an IgG-dominant response, both were associated with having human 
milk that exhibited neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.
