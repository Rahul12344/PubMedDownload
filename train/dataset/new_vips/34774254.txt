BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the life-threatening infectious disease of zoonotic
origin that has epidemic spread in Kazakhstan. The use of geoepidemiological
techniques to detect territories of risk (hotspots) is essential for implementing
control measures in the target area. This study aims to conduct spatial analysis 
of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kazakhstan to increase understanding of the current
features of the virus distribution and to explore its geographical patterns,
especially its spatial clustering.
METHODS: We used geographic information software (QGIS, GeoDa) to perform spatial
analysis (Nearest Neighbour Analysis, Global Moran's I, Getis-Ord Gi*, LISA) and 
to detect COVID-19 risk clusters in the entire territory of Kazakhstan.
RESULTS: Clusters of COVID-19 cases were detected using the Getis-Ord GI*
analysis (with first order Queen Continuity matrix) in two oblasts of Kazakhstan:
Almaty (Iliyskiy, Karasayskiy, Raiymbekskiy, Talgarskiy rayons and city of
Almaty) and Aqmola (Arshalynskiy, Ereymengauskiy, Korgalzhynskiy and
Shortandinskiy rayons). LISA defined four High-High clusters of COVID-19 cases in
the Almaty oblast (Iliyskiy, Karasayskiy and Talgarskiy rayons) and city of
Almaty.
