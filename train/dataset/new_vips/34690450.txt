The longest common consecutive subsequences (LCCS) play a vital role in revealing
the biological relationships between DNA/RNA sequences especially the newly
discovered ones such as COVID-19. FLAT is a Fragmented local aligner technique
which is an accelerated version of the local pairwise sequence alignment
algorithm based on meta-heuristic algorithms. The performance of FLAT needs to be
enhanced since the huge length of biological sequences leads to trapping in local
optima. This paper introduces a modified version of FLAT based on improving the
performance of the BA algorithm by integration with particle swarm optimization
(PSO) algorithm based on a novel infection mechanism. The proposed algorithm,
named BPINF, depends on finding the best-explored solution using BA operators
which can infect the agents during the exploitation phase using PSO operators to 
move toward it instead of moving toward the best-exploited solution. Hence,
moving the solutions toward the two best solutions increase the diversity of
generated solutions and avoids trapping in local optima. The infection can be
propagated through the agents where each infected agent can transfer the
infection to other non-infected agents which enhances the diversification of
generated solutions. FLAT using the proposed technique (BPINF) was validated to
detect LCCS between a set of real biological sequences with huge lengths besides 
COVID-19 and other well-known viruses. The performance of BPINF was compared to
the enhanced versions of BA in the literature and the relevant studies of FLAT.
It has a preponderance to find the LCCS with the highest percentage (88%) which
is better than other state-of-the-art methods.
