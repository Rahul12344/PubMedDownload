Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a mostly enterically transmitted agent of viral,
usually acute hepatitis. In recent years, however, it has been proven to
establish chronicity in immunosuppressed patients. We report the first case of
HEV infection in a patient with myelofibrosis under ruxolitinib, a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor. Although this patient was able to mount a humoral response with
specific immunoglobulin G, viral replication could not be controlled until
ruxolitinib suspension. After normalization of liver enzymes and clearance of
HEV, ruxolitinib was reintroduced with no disease relapse, suggesting spontaneous
eradication of the virus.
