OBJECTIVES: The applicability of proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry
(PTR-MS) as a versatile online monitoring tool to increase consistency and
robustness for recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) producing HEK 293
bioprocesses was evaluated. We present a structured workflow to extract process
relevant information from PTR-MS data.
RESULTS: Reproducibility of volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements was
demonstrated with spiking experiments and the process data sets used for
applicability evaluation consisted of HEK 293 cell culture triplicates with and
without transfection. The developed data workflow enabled the identification of
six VOCs, of which two were used to develop a soft sensor providing better
real-time estimates than the conventional capacitance sensor. Acetaldehyde,
another VOC, provides online process information about glucose depletion that can
directly be used for process control purposes.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential of PTR-MS for HEK 293 cell culture monitoring has been
shown. VOC data derived information can be used to develop soft sensors and to
directly set up new process control strategies.
