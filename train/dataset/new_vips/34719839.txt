BACKGROUND: People with serious mental illness (SMI) are underserved from a
hepatitis C Virus (HCV) screening and treatment perspective.
AIMS: To examine the HCV care cascade in people with SMI and to pilot a supported
HCV treatment integration program.
METHODS: HCV prevalence was retrospectively analysed from 4,492 consecutive
individuals admitted to a tertiary hospital mental health service between January
2017 and December 2018. Sub-cohort analysis of screening patterns and predictors 
of seropositive infection was performed. Referral pathways and community care
integration were analysed for HCV positive individuals, and a prospective
community-based 'identify and treat' HCV program was assessed.
RESULTS: Screening for HCV had been performed in 18.6% (835/4,492) of the cohort.
Seroprevalence was 4.6% (207/4,492). HCV seropositivity was associated with age
> 40-years (OR = 9.30, CI 3.69-23.45, p <0.01), injecting drug use (IDU)
(OR = 24.26, CI 8.99-65.43, p <0.01), and previous incarceration (OR = 12.26,
4.51-33.31, p <0.01). In a cohort of treatment-eligible individuals, 43.3%
(90/208) had neither been referred to specialist services or general
practitioners for HCV management. Amongst those referred to specialist services, 
64.7% (57/88) did not attend scheduled follow-up, and 48.3% (15/31) of attendees 
were lost to follow-up. Through an intensified community access program, 10
people were successfully treated for HCV, though 22 could not be engaged.
CONCLUSION: People with SMI are underserved by traditional models of HCV
healthcare. Intensified community-based support can partially bolster the
treatment cascade, though investment in innovative screening and management
strategies are required to achieve healthcare parity. This article is protected
