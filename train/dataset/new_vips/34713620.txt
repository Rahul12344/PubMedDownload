INTRODUCTION: Differentiated service delivery (DSD) models aim to improve the
access of human immunodeficiency virus treatment on clients and reduce
requirements for facility visits by extending dispensing intervals. With the
advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimising client contact with healthcare
facilities and other clients, while maintaining treatment continuity and avoiding
loss to care, has become more urgent, resulting in efforts to increase DSD
uptake. We assessed the extent to which DSD coverage and antiretroviral treatment
(ART) dispensing intervals have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia.
METHODS: We used client data from Zambia's electronic medical record system
(SmartCare) for 737 health facilities, representing about three-fourths of all
ART clients nationally. We compared the numbers and proportional distributions of
clients enrolled in DSD models in the 6 months before and 6 months after the
first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Zambia in March 2020. Segmented linear
regression was used to determine whether the outbreak of COVID-19 in Zambia
further accelerated the increase in DSD scale-up.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Between September 2019 and August 2020, 181,317 clients
aged 15 or older (81,520 and 99,797 from 1 September 2019 to 1 March 2020 and
from 1 March to 31 August 2020, respectively) enrolled in DSD models in Zambia.
Overall participation in all DSD models increased over the study period, but
uptake varied by model. The rate of acceleration increased in the second period
for home ART delivery (152%), ≤ 2-month fast-track (143%) and 3-month MMD (139%).
There was a significant reduction in the enrolment rates for 4- to 6-month
fast-track (-28%) and "other" models (-19%).
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in DSD models for stable ART clients in Zambia
increased after the advent of COVID-19, but dispensing intervals diminished.
Eliminating obstacles to longer dispensing intervals, including those related to 
supply chain management, should be prioritized to achieve the expected benefits
of DSD models and minimize COVID-19 risk.
