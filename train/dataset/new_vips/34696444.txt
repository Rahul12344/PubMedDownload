Currently countries across the globe are preparing for the fourth wave of
SARS-CoV-2 infections, which is mainly driven by the rapid spread of novel
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Austria and, in particular, the capital city of Vienna,
witnessed a disproportionally steep rise in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates during the
last wave of infections. By the end of January 2021, the government of Vienna
launched an innovative, state-wide SARS-CoV-2 screening program based on PCR
analysis of self-collected mouthwash samples. More than 400,000 mouthwash samples
were collected in Vienna during the third wave of infection from January to March
2021. All preanalytical and analytical steps were carried out in a highly
standardized manner at a single certified testing center. SARS-CoV-2 specific PCR
analysis revealed in these samples a positivity rate of 0.43%. The relative
proportion of N501Y positive virus samples increased continually to 68% of weekly
samples. Mutation K417N was detected only in three samples. With this study, we
were able to map the temporal occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a highly
unbiased manner. Positivity rates and variant prevalence rates in this study were
lower than in other nationwide programs. The results presented in this study
indicate that actual virus prevalence tends to be overestimated by surveillance
programs such as results of cluster analysis or contact tracing programs.
