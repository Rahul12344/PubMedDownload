Currently, the ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus infection is still a
major public health problem worldwide. The questions of immunosuppressive therapy
of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, the possibility of
vaccination against the background of the use of genetically engineered drugs
remain open. The article is of an overview nature and includes up-to-date
information on the feasibility and safety of the use of genetically engineered
biological drugs in patients with psoriasis in a pandemic (COVID-19). According
to the international recommendations of the National Psoriasis Foundation
COVID-19 Task Force expert group, treatment of psoriasis and/or PsA does not
significantly alter the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not lead to worse
prognosis of COVID-19. Therefore, patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2 should
continue biological or other systemic therapy for psoriasis and/or PsA. According
to a registry from 25 countries, hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 infection was
more common in patients receiving nonbiological systemic therapy than in patients
receiving BAs. Thus, genetically engineered biological drugs do not appear to
cause an increased risk of coronavirus infection and do not determine a more
severe course. With regard to vaccination of patients with psoriasis, many issues
require further study. According to international agreements, vaccination is not 
contraindicated in patients with psoriatic disease. However, there is still
insufficient data on how the treatment of psoriatic disease affects vaccination. 
Avoiding COVID-19 or reducing the severity of infection following SARS-CoV-2
vaccination is thought to far outweigh any risk directly related to vaccination
complications.
