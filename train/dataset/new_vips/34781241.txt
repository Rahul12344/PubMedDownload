INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread associated 
use of non-pharmaceutical interventions have impacted viral circulation and the
incidence of respiratory tract infections. We compared Pediatric Emergency
Department visits, bronchiolitis admissions, and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) cases in 2020 with those documented for the preceding four years.
METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentric national survey study, driven by
the Pediatric Spanish Society, and gathering monthly data from Spanish hospitals 
between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2020. An Interrupted Time Series
Analysis and Poisson regression models were performed for each index.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight hospitals representing most of the different regions of
Spain participated. Compared to the preceding four years, in 2020, Pediatric
emergency department visits significantly decreased immediately after initiation 
of the national lockdown. The median number of visits averted per month was
39,754 (IQR 26,539-50,065). RSV diagnoses during the 2020 winter season nearly
disappeared with only 21 cases being documented among participating hospitals.
The expected seasonal peak of bronchiolitis hospitalizations never occurred. The 
median number of admissions in 2020 averted per month was 100 (IQR 37-185)
compared to 2016-2019. Only 3 hospitalized cases were RSV-confirmed. Reopening of
schools and kindergarten was not associated with a remarkable increase in RSV
cases or bronchiolitis hospitalizations.
CONCLUSION: A dramatic reduction of bronchiolitis admissions and near
disappearance of RSV cases was observed in Spanish hospitals coinciding with the 
peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
