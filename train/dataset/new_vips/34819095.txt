BACKGROUND: There has been little research on the impact of the 2014-2015 West
African Ebola crisis on people with disabilities. This paper outlines the way in 
which the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia in 2015 highlighted
existing inequalities and exclusion of people with disabilities and their
households.
METHODS: The results presented here are part of a larger ESRC/DFID-funded mixed
methods research project in Liberia (2014-2017) which included a quantitative
household survey undertaken in five counties, complemented by qualitative focus
group discussions and interviews with people with disabilities and other key
stakeholders. Uniquely, this research gathered information about people with
disabilities' experience of the EVD outbreak, as well as additional socioeconomic
and inclusion data, that compared their experience with non-disabled community
members.
RESULTS: Reflections by people with disabilities themselves show knowledge,
preparation, and responses to the EVD epidemic was often markedly different among
people with disabilities due to limited resources, lack of inclusion by many
mainstream public health and medical interventions and pre-existing
discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion. Interviews with other key
stakeholder revealed a lack of awareness of disability issues or sufficient
training to include this population systematically in both Ebola response
activities and general health services. Key findings include the need to
understand and mitigate direct and indirect health consequences of unequal
responses to the epidemic, as well as the limited capacity of healthcare and
social services to respond to people with disabilities.
CONCLUSION: There are lessons to be learned from Ebola outbreak around inclusion 
of people with disabilities, relevant to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Now is
the time to undertake measures to ensure that people with disabilities do not
continue to be marginalised and excluded during global public health emergencies.
