As CRISPR/Cas systems have been refined over time, there has been an effort to
apply them to real world problems, such as developing sequence-targeted antiviral
therapies. Viruses pose a major threat to humans and new tools are urgently
needed to combat these rapidly mutating pathogens. Importantly, a variety of
CRISPR systems have the potential to directly cleave DNA and RNA viral genomes,
in a targeted and easily-adaptable manner, thus preventing or treating
infections. This perspective article highlights recent studies using different
Cas effectors against various RNA viruses causing acute infections in humans; a
latent virus (HIV-1); a chronic virus (hepatitis B); and viruses infecting
livestock and animal species of industrial importance. The outlook and remaining 
challenges are discussed, particularly in the context of tacking newly emerging
viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.
