Paper-based biosensor is one of the most commonly used platforms for
point-of-care testing (POCT). Among these platforms, microfluidic paper-based
analytical devices (μPADs) have the most versatile designs due to the different
hydrophobic barrier patterns and layers of the devices. In addition, μPADs can
also be used in combination with other biosensor platforms to improve the
performance of the device. Simple and convenient methods for fabricating low-cost
and design-adjustable hydrophobic barriers on paper are one of the most
challenging aspects for creating μPADs. This work demonstrated a simple technique
for using the common polylactic acid (PLA) filament and wax filament to create
hydrophobic barriers on paper for μPADs using a commercialized 3D printer. As a
proof of concept, the papers with 3D printed PLA barrier were used in combination
with a fluidic chip in a prototype biosensor, in which the barrier paper housed
four cell-free reactions and the fluidic chip achieved sample delivery to the
reactions in the device. Our designed prototype was capable of discriminating
dengue virus serotypes based on small nucleotide sequence differences. The
proposed combination of 3D-printed barrier paper and fluidic chip provides a
versatile platform for rapid prototyping of POCT with possible compatibility with
various detection systems.
