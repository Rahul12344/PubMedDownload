Purpose: Multiple studies worldwide have reported the clinical and
epidemiological features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with limited
reports from the Middle East. This study describes the clinical and
epidemiological features of COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Province of Saudi
Arabia and identified factors associated with the severity of illness.
Patients and Methods: This was an observational study of 341 COVID-19 cases.
These cases were reported in the first three months after the first case in the
country was identified. Clinical and demographic data were analyzed and described
to identify the effects of age, sex, and ethnicity on illness severity. In
addition, the duration of viral shedding and cycle threshold (Ct) values of
real-time PCR were evaluated as predictors of severity.
Results: The median age was 45 years. Males were twice as likely to be infected
than females (p <0.0001). The duration of viral shedding ranged from 9 to 36
days. The most common clinical presentations include fever, shortness of breath, 
cough, myalgia, sore throat, vomiting, and headache. Critical cases were
significantly higher in men (23% vs 8.7%), senior adults (>65 years), individuals
of Bengali ethnicity, and in patients with comorbidities including diabetes,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia (p =0.001). The case fatality rate was found to be
10%. The fatality was significantly higher in males than females (13.8% vs 2.6%),
and in Asians (17.9%) than Arabs (6%) and Africans (0) (p =0.002). No association
was found between viral load, represented by the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct)
values, and severity of illness.
Conclusion: Age, sex, and ethnicity are important predictors of COVID-19
severity. The cycle threshold (Ct) of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test cannot be used
as a predictor of the criticality of illness.
