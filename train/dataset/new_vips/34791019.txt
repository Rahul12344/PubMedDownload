The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible
for millions of deaths around the world. To help contribute to the understanding 
of crucial knowledge and to further generate new hypotheses relevant to
SARS-CoV-2 and human protein interactions, we make use of the information
abundant Biomine probabilistic database and extend the experimentally identified 
SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in silico. We generate
an extended network by integrating information from the Biomine database, the PPI
network and other experimentally validated results. To generate novel hypotheses,
we focus on the high-connectivity sub-communities that overlap most with the
integrated experimentally validated results in the extended network. Therefore,
we propose a new data analysis pipeline that can efficiently compute core
decomposition on the extended network and identify dense subgraphs. We then
evaluate the identified dense subgraph and the generated hypotheses in three
contexts: literature validation for uncovered virus targeting genes and proteins,
gene function enrichment analysis on subgraphs and literature support on drug
repurposing for identified tissues and diseases related to COVID-19. The major
types of the generated hypotheses are proteins with their encoding genes and we
rank them by sorting their connections to the integrated experimentally validated
nodes. In addition, we compile a comprehensive list of novel genes, and proteins 
potentially related to COVID-19, as well as novel diseases which might be
comorbidities. Together with the generated hypotheses, our results provide novel 
knowledge relevant to COVID-19 for further validation.
