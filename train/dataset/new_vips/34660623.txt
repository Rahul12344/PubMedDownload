Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 200 countries
and lead to enormous losses. This study systematically reviews the application of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis,
estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safe
drugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We report
this systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and the
Cochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI 
applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias
assessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis and
prognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555).
Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for 
COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%,
specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000.
Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics at
hospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiological
characteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to
98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predicting
critical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of the
COVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases,
transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explore
potential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drug
development. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potential
to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI 
achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic prediction
and drug discovery for COVID-19. AI has the potential to enhance significantly
existing medical and healthcare system efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.
