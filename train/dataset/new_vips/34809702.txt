Infection prevention strategies are highly protective in COVID-19 units while
main risks to healthcare professionals come from coworkers and the community.

BACKGROUND: Early evaluations of healthcare professional (HCP) COVID-19 risk
occurred during insufficient personal protective equipment and disproportionate
testing, contributing to perceptions of high patient-care related HCP risk. We
evaluated HCP COVID-19 seropositivity after accounting for community factors and 
coworker outbreaks.
METHODS: Prior to universal masking, we conducted a single-center retrospective
cohort plus cross-sectional study. All HCP (1) seen by Occupational Health for
COVID-like symptoms (regardless of test result) or assigned to (2) dedicated
COVID-19 units, (3) units with a COVID-19 HCP outbreak, or (4) control units from
01/01/2020 to 04/15/2020 were offered serologic testing by an FDA-authorized
assay plus a research assay against 67 respiratory viruses, including 11
SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Multivariable models assessed the association of
demographics, job role, comorbidities, care of a COVID-19 patient, and geocoded
socioeconomic status with positive serology.
RESULTS: Of 654 participants, 87 (13.3%) were seropositive; among these 60.8%
(N = 52) had never cared for a COVID-19 patient. Being male (OR 1.79, CI
1.05-3.04, p = 0.03), working in a unit with a HCP-outbreak unit (OR 2.21, CI
1.28-3.81, p < 0.01), living in a community with low owner-occupied housing
(OR = 1.63, CI = 1.00-2.64, p = 0.05), and ethnically Latino (OR 2.10, CI
1.12-3.96, p = 0.02) were positively-associated with COVID-19 seropositivity,
while working in dedicated COVID-19 units was negatively-associated (OR 0.53,
CI = 0.30-0.94, p = 0.03). The research assay identified 25 additional
seropositive individuals (78 [12%] vs. 53 [8%], p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Prior to universal masking, HCP COVID-19 risk was dominated by
workplace and community exposures while working in a dedicated COVID-19 unit was 
protective, suggesting that infection prevention protocols prevent patient-to-HCP
transmission. Prior to universal masking, HCP COVID-19 risk was dominated by
