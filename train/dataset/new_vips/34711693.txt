Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing an anti-rabies monoclonal antibody
(mAb), SO57, was obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) was tagged
to the C-terminus of the anti-rabies mAb heavy chain to localize the mAb to the
ER and enhance its accumulation. When the inaccurately folded proteins
accumulated in the ER exceed its storage capacity, it results in stress that can 
affect plant development and growth. We generated T1 transformants and obtained
homozygous T3 seeds from transgenic Arabidopsis to investigate the effect of KDEL
on plant growth. The germination rate did not significantly differ between plants
expressing mAb SO57 without KDEL (SO plant) and mAb SO57 with KDEL (SOK plant).
The primary roots of SOK agar media grown plants were slightly shorter than those
of SO plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed that expression of all 11 ER
stress-related genes were not significantly changed in SOK plants relative to SO 
plants. SOK plants showed approximately three-fold higher mAb expression levels
than those of SO plants. Consequently, the purified mAb amount per unit of SOK
plant biomass was approximately three times higher than that of SO plants. A
neutralization assay revealed that both plants exhibited efficient rapid
fluorescent focus inhibition test values against the rabies virus relative to
commercially available human rabies immunoglobulins. KDEL did not upregulate ER
stress-related genes; therefore, the enhanced production of the mAb did not
affect plant growth. Thus, KDEL fusion is recommended for enhancing mAb
production in plant systems.
