The heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70) is among the most varied HSP family with
respect to structure and function. The phloem-feeding insect Bemisia tabaci
(Gennadius) is an important pest of cotton, vegetables and ornamentals that
transmits several plant viruses and causes enormous agricultural losses. In this 
study, two new HSP70 genes (Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3) were isolated from the MED
cryptic species B. tabaci, an important phloem-feeding pest of vegetables and
ornamentals. Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3 encoded proteins comprised of 652 and 676
amino acids, and the deduced proteins were closely related to other HSP70s in
Hemiptera. Expression analyses using real-time quantitative PCR indicated that
Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3 were induced in B. tabaci pupae and adults during high
and low thermal stress. Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3 exhibited similar, but not
identical, expression patterns when exposed to different durations of high
temperature stress. Oral ingestion of dsBthsp70 reduced the expression level of
Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3 in B. tabaci and increased the mortality of B. tabaci
during heat shock. In conclusion, Bthsp70-2 and Bthsp70-3 exhibit different
expression patterns during thermal stress, thus expanding the roles of HSPs in B.
tabaci.
