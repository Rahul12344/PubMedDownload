Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) esophagitis is a relatively rare form of infectious
esophagitis. Typically, patients with viral esophagitis are immunocompromised.
HSV esophagitis in an immunocompetent patient is uncommonly reported. The
objective of this case report is to discuss symptoms, investigations, imaging,
and treatment of HSV esophagitis in a healthy adolescent male. A previously
healthy 17-year-old male presented to the ED of our facility with a 5-day history
of fever, odynophagia, lethargy, and 2 episodes of emesis that failed to resolve 
with antibiotic treatment. Investigations revealed a low platelet count, mild
hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and an elevated AST and ALT. A respiratory infection
panel as well as CMV IgG, HIV, Rickettsia, and EBV tests were negative. HSV-1 PCR
was positive and upper endoscopy revealed a friable mucosa, erythema, and
exudates in the lower esophagus and erythematous duodenopathy. The patient
received a diagnosis of HSV esophagitis and was treated with a 14-day course of
IV to PO acyclovir. There was a rapid improvement of his symptoms with antiviral 
therapy.
