We investigate the problem of mathematical modeling of new corona virus
(COVID-19) in Poland and tries to predict the upcoming wave. A Gaussian mixture
model is proposed to characterize the COVID-19 disease and to predict a new /
future wave of COVID-19. This prediction is very much needed to prepare for
medical setup and continue with the upcoming program. Specifically, data related 
to the new confirmed cases of COVID-19 per day are considered, and then we
attempt to predict the data and statistical activity. A close match between
actual data and analytical data by using the Gaussian mixture model shows that it
is a suitable model to present new cases of COVID-19. In addition, it is thought 
that there are N waves of COVID-19 and that information for each future wave is
also present in current and previous waves as well. Using this concept,
predictions of a future wave can be made.
