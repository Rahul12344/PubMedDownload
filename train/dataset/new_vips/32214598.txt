A technique for culturing small quantities of mammalian cells on modified
microscope slides is described. The modified microscope slides were Bellco Glass,
Inc., toxoplasmosis slides and the cell cultures used were early passage bovine
embryonic lung cells and continuous cell lines of porcine and canine origins. The
slide cell cultures were either uninfected or infected with selected viruses or
the obligate intracellular protozoanEncephalitozoon caniculi for utilization in
direct and indirect fluorescent antibody testing or in peroxidase antiperoxidase 
immunosorbant assays.
