The effects of simultaneous or serial infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza
virus are unknown. Here, we report that, in a hamster model, SARS-CoV-2 infection
at the same time as or prior to H3N2 influenza virus infection resulted in
significantly reduced influenza virus titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates of
infected animals. This interference of influenza virus replication may correlate 
with SARS-CoV-2-induced expression of the antiviral gene MX1.
