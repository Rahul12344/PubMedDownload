Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease
caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). The US FDA has approved several therapeutics and vaccines worldwide
through the emergency use authorization in response to the rapid spread of
COVID-19. Nevertheless, the efficacies of these treatments are being challenged
by viral escape mutations. There is an urgent need to develop effective
treatments protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and to establish a stable
effect-screening model to test potential drugs. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) have
an intrinsic advantage in such developments because they can target rapidly
mutating viral strains as a result of the complexity of their binding epitopes.
In this study, we generated anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) pAbs from
rabbit serum and tested their safety and efficacy in response to SARS-CoV-2
infection both in vivo and ex vivo. Primary human bronchial epithelial
two-dimensional (2-D) organoids were cultured and differentiated to a mature
morphology and subsequently employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug screening.
The pAbs protected the airway organoids from viral infection and tissue damage.
Potential side effects were tested in mouse models for both inhalation and vein
injection. The pAbs displayed effective viral neutralization effects without
significant side effects. Thus, the use of animal immune serum-derived pAbs might
be a potential therapy for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the
strategy developed to produce these pAbs providing new insight into the treatment
of respiratory tract infections, especially for infections with viruses
undergoing rapid mutation.
