An operationally implementable predictive model has been developed to forecast
the number of COVID-19 infections in the patient population, hospital floor and
ICU censuses, ventilator and related supply chain demand. The model is intended
for clinical, operational, financial and supply chain leaders and executives of a
comprehensive healthcare system responsible for making decisions that depend on
epidemiological contingencies. This paper describes the model that was
implemented at NorthShore University HealthSystem and is applicable to any
communicable disease whose risk of reinfection for the duration of the pandemic
is negligible.
