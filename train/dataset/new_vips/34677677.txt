A begomovirus was isolated from a Pyrenacantha sp. plant with yellow mosaic
symptoms collected in a maize production field in Mozambique. The complete DNA-A 
and DNA-B components have a genomic organization typical of Old World, bipartite 
begomoviruses. Based on the current ICTV species demarcation criteria for the
genus Begomovirus, the virus isolate, named Pyrenacantha yellow mosaic virus
(PyYMV), is a member of a new species, for which the name "Begomovirus
pyrenacanthae" is proposed. Alignment of their common regions (CR) indicated a
35-nt insertion in the DNA-A CR. The nt sequence identity between the CRs is only
83% but increases to 96% when the 35-nt insertion is removed from the alignment. 
This is the first report of a begomovirus naturally infecting Pyrenacantha spp.
