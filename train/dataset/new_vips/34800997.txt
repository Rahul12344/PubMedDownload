BACKGROUND: The COVID-19-pandemic and especially the physical distancing measures
drastically changed the conditions for providing outpatient care in adolescent
psychiatry.
METHODS: We investigated the outpatient services of adolescent psychiatry in the 
Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) from 1/1/2015 until 12/31/2020. We retrieved
data from the in-house data software on the number of visits in total and
categorized as in-person or remote visits, and analysed the data on a weekly
basis. We further analysed these variables grouped according to the psychiatric
diagnoses coded for visits. Data on the number of patients and on referrals from 
other health care providers were available on a monthly basis. We investigated
the data descriptively and with a time-series analysis comparing the pre-pandemic
period to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The total number of visits decreased slightly at the early stage of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. Remote visits sharply increased starting in
3/2020 and remained at a high level compared with previous years. In-person
visits decreased in Spring 2020, but gradually increased afterwards. The number
of patients transiently fell in Spring 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid switch to remote visits in outpatient care of adolescent
psychiatry made it possible to avoid a drastic drop in the number of visits
despite the physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
