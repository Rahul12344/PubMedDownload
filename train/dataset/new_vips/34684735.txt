In continuation of our previous effort, different in silico selection methods
were applied to 310 naturally isolated metabolites that exhibited antiviral
potentialities before. The applied selection methods aimed to pick the most
relevant inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10. At first, a structural similarity study
against the co-crystallized ligand, S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM), of SARS-CoV-2
nonstructural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H) was carried out. The similarity
analysis culled 30 candidates. Secondly, a fingerprint study against SAM
preferred compounds 44, 48, 85, 102, 105, 182, 220, 221, 282, 284, 285, 301, and 
302. The docking studies picked 48, 182, 220, 221, and 284. While the ADMET
analysis expected the likeness of the five candidates to be drugs, the toxicity
study preferred compounds 48 and 182. Finally, a density-functional theory (DFT) 
study suggested vidarabine (182) to be the most relevant SARS-Cov-2 nsp10
inhibitor.
