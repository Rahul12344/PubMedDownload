Point-of-care antigen tests are an important tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Antigen tests are less sensitive than real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR
(rRT-PCR). Data on the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test compared to
rRT-PCR and viral culture by symptom and known exposure status, timing during
disease or exposure period and demographic variables are limited. During November
3rd-17th, 2020, we collected paired upper respiratory swab specimens to test for 
SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR and Abbott BinaxNOW (BinaxNOW) antigen test at two
community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona. We administered a questionnaire 
to capture symptoms, known exposure status and previous SARS-CoV-2 test results. 
Specimens positive by either test were analyzed by viral culture. Previously we
showed overall BinaxNOW sensitivity was 52.5%. Here we showed BinaxNOW
sensitivity increased to 65.7% among currently symptomatic individuals reporting 
a known exposure. BinaxNOW sensitivity was lower among participants with a known 
exposure and previously symptomatic (32.4%) or never symptomatic (47.1%) within
14 days of testing. Sensitivity was 71.1% in participants within a week of
symptom onset. In participants with a known exposure, sensitivity was highest
8-10 days post-exposure (75%). The positive predictive value for recovery of
virus in cell culture was 56.7% for BinaxNOW-positive and 35.4% for
rRT-PCR-positive specimens. Result reporting time was 2.5 hours for BinaxNOW and 
26 hours for rRT-PCR. Point-of-care antigen tests have a shorter turn-around time
compared to laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests, which allows for
more rapid identification of infected individuals. Antigen test sensitivity
limitations are important to consider when developing a testing program.
