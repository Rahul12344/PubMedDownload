Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the 
third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. HCC is a complex multistep 
disease and usually emerges in the setting of chronic liver diseases. The
molecular pathogenesis of HCC varies according to the etiology, mainly caused by 
chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections, chronic alcohol consumption,
aflatoxin-contaminated food, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated
with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus. The establishment of HCC models has
become essential for both basic and translational research to improve our
understanding of the pathophysiology and unravel new molecular drivers of this
disease. The ideal model should recapitulate key events observed during
hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC progression in view of establishing effective
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to be translated into clinical practice.
Despite considerable efforts currently devoted to liver cancer research, only a
few anti-HCC drugs are available, and patient prognosis and survival are still
poor. The present paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of in vivo and in
vitro models used for translational modeling of HCC with a specific focus on
their key molecular hallmarks.
