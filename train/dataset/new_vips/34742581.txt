Since the first cases of AIDS appeared in 1981, human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1) infection has reached pandemic proportions. Forty years later, research
has led to the approval of more than 30 antiretroviral drugs, while combination
therapies have turned HIV-1 infection into a chronic, but manageable disease.
Still, drug toxicity and acquired and transmitted drug resistance remain as major
threats to therapy success. In this review, we provide an overview on currently
available anti-HIV drugs and the latest developments in antiretroviral therapy,
focused on new antiretroviral agents acting on known and unexploited antiviral
targets, prevention therapies aimed to improve available drug combinations, and
research on new long-acting therapies, particularly those involving novel drug
candidates such as lenacapavir or islatravir.
