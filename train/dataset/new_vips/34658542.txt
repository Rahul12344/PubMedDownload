Background: Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important
risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Even though
treatment options for HCC are constantly improving, preventive measures must not 
be neglected.
Conclusion: The vaccination against hepatitis B has proven effective in
preventing infection with HBV. As shown more than 20 years ago in Taiwan,
vaccination programs lower not only the prevalence of HBsAg carriers but also
decrease the incidence of HCC. By achieving immunity against HBV, the infection
with hepatitis D virus can also be prevented. This is important in the light of
HCC prevention as HBV/HDV coinfection is known to drastically increase the risk
of HCC. New approaches aim for the development of therapeutic HBV vaccines
ideally curing chronic infections. Beside the prevention of infections, it is
pivotal to detect existing infections. This helps to minimize the HCC risk by
initiating treatment in those who need it.
