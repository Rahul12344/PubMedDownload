Latin American governments swiftly implemented income assistance programs to
sustain families' livelihoods during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. This paper
analyzes the potential coverage and generosity of these measures and assesses the
suitability of current safety nets to deal with unexpected negative income shocks
in 10 Latin American countries. The expansion of pre-existing programs (most
notably conditional cash transfers and non-contributory pensions) during the
COVID-19 crisis was generally insufficient to compensate for the inability to
work among the poorest segments of the population. When COVID-19 ad hoc programs 
are analyzed, the coverage and replacement rates of regular labor income among
households in the first quintile of the country's labor income distribution
increase substantially. Yet, these programs present substantial coverage
challenges among families composed of fundamentally informal workers who are
non-poor, but are at a high risk of poverty. These results highlight the
limitations of the fragmented nature of social protection systems in the region.
