BACKGROUND: A strong negative correlation is reported between the Bacille
Calmette Guerin (BCG) index and COVID-19 mortality. The present study explored if
frequent exposure to strong Th1 antigens like Mycobacteria or Salmonella have any
effect on the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: This prospective comparative study comprised of 3 groups of 20 each of
mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (A), severely ill patients (S) and healthy
volunteers with a COVID Negative report (H).
RESULTS: QuantiFERON TB Gold (QFT) which is interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)
against Mtb antigen was used to quantify immunity status of patients against the 
tuberculosis. Group S showed positive QFT in only 15% patients as against 50% QFT
positive patients in group A and H. All fourteen patients in group S with QFT
negative report died while 5 of six survived patients showed positive QFT report 
either on initial or repeat testing done at 6 weeks. The sixth survived patient
was QFT negative but showed high antibody titre against H antigen (TH) on Widal
test. All severely ill group S patients showed huge reduction of IGRA even to the
mitogen stimulus thus suggesting gross general unresponsiveness of T cells.
Presence of BCG scar showed no correlation with prevalence or progression of the 
disease.
CONCLUSION: Population in an endemic area of tuberculosis and typhoid with good
community exposure to these antigen is likely to withstand COVID -19 better and
show reduced mortality following it.
