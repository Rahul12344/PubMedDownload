Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that is 
often the trigger for thrombotic complications. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 
(CVST) represents a small percentage of strokes, frequently proving to be a
diagnostic challenge. We report a 31-year-old lady presenting with a persistent
headache, 18 weeks after a mild COVID-19 illness. On her second visit, CT
venography revealed extensive CVST. She was commenced on low-molecular-weight
heparin, and was monitored closely in the neuro-medical intensive care unit. She 
was discharged 2 weeks later, with no residual neurological deficit, and
commenced on a direct oral anticoagulant in the community. CVST should be
considered in patients presenting with a refractory headache, with greater
suspicion if previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.
