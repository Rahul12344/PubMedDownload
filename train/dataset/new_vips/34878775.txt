The rapid and unexpected spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has caused unprecedented 
disruption to daily life and has brought forward critical challenges for public
health. The disease was the largest cause of death in the United States in early 
2021. Likewise, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and
accurate diagnoses at scales larger than ever before. To improve the availability
of current gold standard diagnostic testing methods, the development of
point-of-care devices that can maintain gold standard sensitivity while reducing 
the cost and providing portability is much needed. In this work, we combine the
amplification capabilities of reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) techniques with high-sensitivity end-point detection of
crumpled graphene field-effect transistors (cgFETs) to develop a portable
detection cell. This electrical detection method takes advantage of the ability
of graphene to adsorb single-stranded DNA due to noncovalent π-π bonds but not
double-stranded DNA. These devices have demonstrated the ability to detect the
presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a range from 10 to 104 copies/μL in 20 viral 
transport medium (VTM) clinical samples. As a result, we achieved 100% PPV, NPV, 
sensitivity, and specificity with 10 positive and 10 negative VTM clinical
samples. Further, the cgFET devices can differentiate between positive and
negative VTM clinical samples in 35 min based on the Dirac point shift. Likewise,
the improved sensing capabilities of the crumpled gFET were compared with those
of the traditional flat gFET devices.
