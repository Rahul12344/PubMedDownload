The current policy is to test en masse for access on the basis that we then have 
a safe system to prevent the possible spread of an epidemic virus. The question
is whether this reasoning is correct. To answer this, we have developed two
scenarios. One with a low prevalence, as applied in the Fieldlab experiments and 
the other with a fictitious high prevalence of 10%. Both examples show that there
is both collateral damage in the number of people who are wrongly denied access
and in the number of people who are wrongly admitted, which means that it does
not provide the security we hope for. The cost of EUR 60 million per month is as 
much as we spend per year on the national breast cancer screening programme. This
expensive testing policy does not offer 100% safety and is not fair. It is not an
effective policy, either at an individual or a population level.
