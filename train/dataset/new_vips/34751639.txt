Italy was hit harshly by the Covid-19 pandemic, registering more than 35,000
Covid-19 deaths between February and July 2020. During this first wave of the
epidemic, the virus spread unequally across the country, with northern regions
witnessing more cases and deaths. We investigate demographic and socio-economic
factors contributing to the diverse regional impact of the virus during the first
wave. Using generalized additive mixed models, we find that Covid-19 mortality at
regional level is negatively associated with the degree of intergenerational
co-residence, number of intensive care unit beds per capita, and delay in the
outbreak of the epidemic. Conversely, we do not find strong associations for
several variables highlighted in recent literature, such as population density or
the share of the population who are older or have at least one chronic disease.
Our results underscore the importance of context-specific analysis for the study 
of a pandemic.
