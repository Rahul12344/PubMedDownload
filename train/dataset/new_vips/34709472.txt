Encephalopathy is a neurological complication of COVID-19. The objective of this 
exploratory study is to investigate the link between systemic inflammation and
brain microstructural changes (measured by diffusion-weighted imaging) in
patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy. 20 patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy
(age: 67.3 [Formula: see text] 10.0 years; 90% men) hospitalized in the Geneva
University Hospitals for a SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020 were
included in this retrospective cohort study. COVID-19 encephalopathy was
diagnosed following a comprehensive neurobiological evaluation, excluding common 
causes of delirium, such as hypoxemic or metabolic encephalopathy. We
investigated the correlation between systemic inflammation (measured by systemic 
C-reactive protein (CRP)) and brain microstructural changes in radiologically
normal white matter (measured by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) in nine
spatially widespread regions of the white matter previously associated with
delirium. Systemic inflammation (CRP = 60.8 ± 50.0 mg/L) was positively
correlated with ADC values in the anterior corona radiata (p = 0.0089), genu of
the corpus callosum (p = 0.0064) and external capsule (p = 0.0086) after
adjusting for patients' age. No statistically significant association between CRP
and ADC was found in the other six white matter regions. Our findings indicate
high risk of white matter abnormalities in COVID-19 encephalopathy patients with 
high peripheral inflammatory markers, suggesting aggressive imaging monitoring
may be warranted in these patients. Future studies should clarify a possible
specificity of the spatial patterns of CRP-white matter microstructure
association in COVID-19 encephalopathy patients and disentangle the role of
individual cytokines on brain inflammatory mechanisms.
