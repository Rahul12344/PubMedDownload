Arboviruses are transmitted by arthropods (arthropod-borne virus) which can be
mosquitoes or other hematophagous arthropods, in which their life cycle occurs
before transmission to other hosts. Arboviruses such as Dengue, Zika, Saint Louis
Encephalitis, West Nile, Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, Rocio and Murray
Valley Encephalitis viruses are some of the arboviruses transmitted biologically 
among vertebrate hosts by blood-taking vectors, mainly Aedes and Culex sp., and
are associated with neurological, viscerotropic, and hemorrhagic reemerging
diseases, posing as significant health and socioeconomic concern, as they become 
more and more adaptive to new environments, to arthropods vectors and human
hosts. One of the main families that include mosquito-borne viruses is
Flaviviridae, and here, we review the case of the Flavivirus genus, which
comprises the viruses cited above, using a variety of research approaches
published in literature, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,
metabolomics, etc., to better understand their structures as well as virus-host
interactions, which are essential for development of future antiviral therapies.
