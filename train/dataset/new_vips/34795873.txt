The design and synthesis of butyl chain derivatives at the indane ring 3-position
of our lead CD4-mimetic compound BNM-III-170 that inhibits human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV-1) infection are reported. Optimization efforts were guided by
crystallographic and computational analysis of the small-molecule ligands of the 
Phe43 cavity of the envelope glycoprotein gp120. Biological evaluation of 11-21
revealed that members of this series of CD4-mimetic compounds are able to inhibit
HIV-1 viral entry into target cells more potently and with greater breadth
compared to BNM-III-170. Crystallographic analysis of the binding pocket of 14,
16, and 17 revealed a novel hydrogen bonding interaction between His105 and a
primary hydroxyl group on the butyl side chain. Further optimization of this
interaction with the His105 residue holds the promise of more potent CD4-mimetic 
compounds.
