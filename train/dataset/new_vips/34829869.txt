The network module-based method has been used for drug repositioning. The
traditional drug repositioning method only uses the gene characteristics of the
drug but ignores the drug-triggered metabolic changes. The metabolic network
systematically characterizes the connection between genes, proteins, and
metabolic reactions. The differential metabolic flux distribution, as drug
metabolism characteristics, was employed to cluster the agents with similar MoAs 
(mechanism of action). In this study, agents with the same pharmacology were
clustered into one group, and a total of 1309 agents from the CMap database were 
clustered into 98 groups based on differential metabolic flux distribution.
Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis revealed the agents in the same
group (such as group 7 and group 26) were confirmed to have similar MoAs. Through
this agent clustering strategy, the candidate drugs which can inhibit (Japanese
encephalitis virus) JEV infection were identified. This study provides new
insights into drug repositioning and their MoAs.
