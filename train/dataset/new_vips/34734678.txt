In South Vietnam, live bird markets (LBMs) are key in the value chain of poultry 
products and spread of avian influenza virus (AIV) although they may not be the
sole determinant of AIV prevalence. For this reason, a risk analysis of AIV
prevalence was conducted accounting for all value chain factors. A
cross-sectional study of poultry flock managers and poultry on backyard farms,
commercial (high biosecurity) farms, LBMs and poultry delivery stations (PDSs) in
four districts of Vinh Long province was conducted between December 2016 and
August 2017. A total of 3597 swab samples were collected from birds from 101
backyard farms, 50 commercial farms, 58 sellers in LBMs and 19 traders in PDSs.
Swab samples were submitted for AIV isolation. At the same time a questionnaire
was administered to flock managers asking them to provide details of their
knowledge, attitude and practices related to avian influenza. Multiple
correspondence analysis and a mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression
model were developed to identify enterprise and flock manager characteristics
that increased the risk of AIV positivity. A total of 274 birds were positive for
AIV isolation, returning an estimated true prevalence of 7.6% [95% confidence
interval (CI): 6.8%-8.5%]. The odds of a bird being AIV positive if it was from
an LBM or PDS were 45 (95% CI: 3.4-590) and 25 (95% CI: 1.4-460), respectively,
times higher to the odds of a bird from a commercial poultry farm being AIV
positive. The odds of birds being AIV positive for respondents with a mixed
(uncertain or inconsistent) level and a low level of knowledge about AI were 5.0 
(95% CI: 0.20-130) and 3.5 (95% CI: 0.2-62), respectively, times higher to the
odd of birds being positive for respondents with a good knowledge of AI. LBMs and
PDSs should receive specific emphasis in AI control programs in Vietnam. Our
findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that incomplete respondent
knowledge of AI and AIV spread mechanism were associated with an increased risk
of AIV positivity. Delivery of education programs specifically designed for those
in each enterprise will assist in this regard. The timing and frequency of
delivery of education programs are likely to be important if the turnover of
those working in LBMs and PDSs is high.
