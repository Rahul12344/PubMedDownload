An increasing evidence suggests that vanadium compounds are novel potential drugs
in the treatment of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Vanadium has also
demonstrated activities against RNA viruses and is a promising candidate for
treating acute respiratory diseases. The antidiabetic, antihypertensive,
lipid-lowering, cardioprotective, antineoplastic, antiviral, and other potential 
effects of vanadium are summarized here. Given the beneficial antihyperglycemic
and antiinflammatory effects as well as the potential mechanistic link between
the COVID-19 and diabetes, vanadium compounds could be considered as a complement
to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19. Thus, further clinical trials are
warranted to confirm these favorable effects of vanadium treatment in COVID-19
patients, which appear not to be studied yet.
