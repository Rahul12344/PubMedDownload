African swine fever virus (ASFV), the causative pathogen of the recent ASF
epidemic, is a highly contagious double-stranded DNA virus. Its genome is in the 
range of 170~193 kbp and encodes 68 structural proteins and over 100
non-structural proteins. Its high pathogenicity strains cause nearly 100%
mortality in swine. Consisting of four layers of protein shells and an inner
genome, its structure is obviously more complicated than many other viruses, and 
its multi-layered structures play different kinds of roles in ASFV replication
and survival. Each layer possesses many proteins, but very few of the proteins
have been investigated at a structural level. Here, we concluded all the ASFV
proteins whose structures were unveiled, and explained their functions from the
view of structures. Those structures include ASFV AP endonuclease, dUTPases
(E165R), pS273R protease, core shell proteins p15 and p35, non-structural
proteins pA151R, pNP868R (RNA guanylyltransferase), major capsid protein p72
(gene B646L), Bcl-2-like protein A179L, histone-like protein pA104R, sulfhydryl
oxidase pB119L, polymerase X and ligase. These novel structural features, diverse
functions, and complex molecular mechanisms promote ASFV to escape the host
immune system easily and make this large virus difficult to control.
