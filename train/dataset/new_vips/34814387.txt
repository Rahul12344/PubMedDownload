Expert Group for Project of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening and Surveillance, 
Chinese Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignant tumor with a very heavy disease
burden in China. Screening and surveillance are effective measures to improve the
early diagnosis and treatment and survival rate of patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the main cause of
hepatocellular carcinoma, so it is necessary to formulate special screening and
surveillance strategies in China. The Chinese Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention
and Control organized relevant domestic experts to review domestic and foreign
guidelines, combined with current research progress and clinical practice
experience, to form a review, with aim to provide standard reference and improve 
preventive control and outcome effectiveness for HCC screening and surveillance
in patients with chronic HBV infection.
