Norovirus, an enteric virus primarily responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks
worldwide, is currently causing outbreaks around the United Kingdom during the
COVID-19 pandemic. With an already exhausted health care system, the significant 
burden norovirus can have on the National Health Service, including economic and 
social burdens, is immense and cannot be tolerated. Primary challenges and
priorities to be focused on due to the increase in norovirus outbreaks include a 
further depletion of health care services, increase cases in schools, nurseries, 
and care facilities, underreporting of the cases, and no effective vaccine being 
available. Therefore, it is essential to increase awareness about norovirus and
its transmission in public, take necessary precautions, and increase reporting of
cases. This article discusses the impact norovirus has during the COVID-19
pandemic, and the challenges, and recommendations to achieve control before it
reaches epidemic levels.
