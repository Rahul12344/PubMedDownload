Infectious diseases and widespread outbreaks influence different sectors of the
economy, including the stock market. In this article, we investigate the effect
of EBOV and COVID-19 outbreaks on stock market indices. We employ time-varying
and constant bivariate copula methods to measure the dependence structure between
the infectious disease equity market volatility index (IEMV) and the stock market
indices of several sectors. The results show that the financial and communication
services sectors have the highest and the lowest negative dependency on IEMV
during the Ebola virus (EBOV) pandemic, respectively. However, the health care
and energy sectors have the highest and lowest negative dependency on IEMV during
the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Therefore, the results confirm the
heterogeneous time-varying dependency between infectious diseases and the stock
market indices. The finding of our study contributes to the ongoing literature on
the impact of disease outbreaks, especially the novel coronavirus outbreak on
global large-cap companies in the stock market.
