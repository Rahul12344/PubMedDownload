BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Researchers have been studying the pathogenesis of the virus with the aim to
improve our current diagnosis and management strategies. The microbiota have been
proposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
PURPOSE: To investigate and report on the current available evidence on any
associations between the gut and/or airway microbiota and the pathogenesis of
COVID-19.
METHODS: Using a predefined protocol in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines, a 
search was conducted on MEDLINE, Science Direct, DOAJ and Cochrane databases on
primary research studies assessing the association between COVID-19 infection and
the gut and/or airway microbiota.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included in the current review; nineteen studies
concluded an association between the gut and/or airway dysbiosis and SARS-CoV-2, 
while 3 studies failed to observe a significant association between the airway
microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, most studies reported a
decrease in microbial diversity and therefore development of intestinal dysbiosis
in COVID-19-positive patients compared to healthy controls as well as a possible 
association between increased intestinal dysbiosis and disease severity.
CONCLUSION: During infection with SARS-CoV-2, there are significant changes in
the composition of the gut and airway microbiota. Furthermore, the gut microbiota
may have a more important role than the airway microbiota in COVID-19 infection. 
In the future, studies should be more carefully designed to derive more
conclusive evidence on the role of the gut and airway microbiota following
infection with SARS-CoV-2 which will lead to the formulation of better management
strategies in combating COVID-19.
