Our article presents a case of Herpes Simplex esophagitis in an immunocompromised
patient who presented with severe odynophagia on a background of Metastatic
Merkel Cell Carcinoma. Our patient's clinical history and examination findings
initially suggest a likely fungal etiology for esophagitis, however as the case
develops the diagnosis of Herpes Simplex esophagitis becomes more evident. Our
case highlights common endoscopic and histological abnormalities seen in Herpes
Simplex esophagitis. Our discussion elaborates on these abnormalities and reminds
readers of the treatment for HSV esophagitis.
