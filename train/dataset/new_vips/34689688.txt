AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can present either as an asymptomatic carrier
state or an acute respiratory disease, with or without severe pneumonia. The
asymptomatic carriers are a challenge for the dental profession as the infection 
could be transmitted via virus-laden, and saliva in dental settings through
aerosol-generating procedures (AGPSs). The aim of this review was to perform a
systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of asymptomatic individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Google scholar, and MedRxiv databases were
searched between and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data 
were performed to assess the viral burden in the saliva of asymptomatic carriers 
of SARS-CoV-2. All investigators of the included studies used qRT-PCR to detect
SARS-CoV-2 and yield quantitative data (the Ct values) appertaining to the viral 
load.
RESULTS: A total of 322 records in the English literature were identified, and
eight studies with 2642 SARS-CoV-2-positive and asymptomatic individuals were
included in the final analysis. Of these, 16.7% (95% CI: 11-23%) yielded
SARS-CoV-2-positive saliva samples in comparison to 13.1% (95% CI: 12-17%) of the
respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal or nose-throat swabs).
CONCLUSION: As approximately 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 asymptomatic individuals harbour
SARS-CoV-2 in either saliva or respiratory secretions, our results highlight the 
need for continued vigilance and the critical importance of maintaining strict,
additional infection control regimens for the foreseeable future to mitigate the 
potential risks of COVID-19 transmission in dentistry.
