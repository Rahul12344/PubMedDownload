Four hundred and twenty five sera were collected from 18 species of wild mammals 
in Kenya between 1970 and 1981. Neutralising activity to rinderpest virus (RV)
was detected in 35 samples from 13 species. This activity appeared to be specific
antibody to RV since it did not neutralise the virus of peste des petits
ruminants. It was associated with the serum globulin fraction and it blocked the 
staining of a rabbit immunofluorescent antibody conjugate to RV. Positive sera
were not restricted to any particular area of Kenya. It is possible that strains 
of RV with low pathogenicity and low transmissibility are still present in
wildlife in East Africa, a fact which must be considered when studying the
epidemiology and control of rinderpest.
