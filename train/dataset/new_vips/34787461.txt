Over the past decades, studies on the biology of human adenoviruses (HAdVs)
mainly focused on the HAdV prototype species C type 5 (HAdV-C5) and revealed
fundamental molecular insights into mechanisms of viral replication and viral
cell transformation. Recently, other HAdV species are gaining more and more
attention in the field. Reports on large E1B proteins (E1B-55K) from different
HAdV species showed that these multifactorial proteins possess strikingly
different features along with highly conserved functions. In this work, we
identified potential SUMO-conjugation motifs (SCMs) in E1B-55K proteins from HAdV
species A to F. Mutational inactivation of these SCMs demonstrated that HAdV
E1B-55K proteins are SUMOylated at a single lysine residue that is highly
conserved among HAdV species B to E. Moreover, we provide evidence that E1B-55K
SUMOylation is a potent regulator of intracellular localization and p53-mediated 
transcription in most HAdV species. We also identified a lysine residue at
position 101 (K101), which is unique to HAdV-C5 E1B-55K and specifically
regulates its SUMOylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. Our findings reveal
important new aspects on HAdV E1B-55K proteins and suggest that different E1B-55K
species possess conserved SCMs while their SUMOylation has divergent cellular
effects during infection. Importance E1B-55K is a multifunctional adenoviral
protein and its functions are highly regulated by SUMOylation. Although
functional consequences of SUMOylated HAdV-C5 E1B-55K are well studied, we lack
information on the effects of SUMOylation on homologous E1B-55K proteins from
other HAdV species. Here, we show that SUMOylation is a conserved
post-translational modification in most of the E1B-55K proteins, similar to what 
we know about HAdV-C5 E1B-55K. Moreover, we identify subcellular localization and
regulation of p53-dependent transcription as highly conserved
SUMOylation-regulated E1B-55K functions. Thus, our results highlight how HAdV
proteins might have evolved in different HAdV species with conserved domains
involved in virus replication and differing alternative functions and
interactions with the host cell machinery. Future research will link these
differences and similarities to the diverse pathogenicity and organ tropism of
the different HAdV species.
