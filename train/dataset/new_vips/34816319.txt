INTRODUCTION: To the best of our knowledge, here we present two post-COVID19
longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) with atypical presentations
CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 44-year-old male who did not have any previous medical
condition and a 73-year-old male foreigner who did not have any disease other
than type 2 diabetes mellitus were admitted to our neurology clinic in the same
period with similar clinical presentations of transverse myelitis. Upon
admission, paraplegia and urinary-fecal incontinence were observed in their
neurological examination. Neurological complaints had started within
approximately 3-4 weeks following the resolution of the COVID-19 infection.
Thoracic lower segment LETM was observed on spinal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in one of the patients, and long segment myelitis extending from the lower 
thoracic segment to the conus medullaris was observed in the other one. No
significant diagnostic positivity was present in their diagnostic evaluation. In 
both cases, we assume a post-infectious etiology in terms of secondary
immunogenic overreaction following COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: Our patients improved with multiple treatments such as
methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis. Whether
post-infectious myelitis behaves differently from other viral infections after
COVID-19 is currently unclear. Long lag times appear to be a post-infectious
neurological complication resulting from the host response to the virus.
