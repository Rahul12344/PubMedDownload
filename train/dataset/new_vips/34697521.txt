This work aims at a better understanding and the optimal control of the spread of
the new severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A multi-scale model
giving insights on the virus population dynamics, the transmission process and
the infection mechanism is proposed first. Indeed, there are human to human virus
transmission, human to environment virus transmission, environment to human virus
transmission and self-infection by susceptible individuals. The global stability 
of the disease-free equilibrium is shown when a given threshold T 0 is less or
equal to 1 and the basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated. A convergence
index T 1 is also defined in order to estimate the speed at which the disease
extincts and an upper bound to the time of infectious extinction is given. The
existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is
provided. Using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient with a three levels
fractional experimental design, the sensitivity of  R 0 , T 0 and T 1 to control 
parameters is evaluated. Following this study, the most significant parameter is 
the probability of wearing mask followed by the probability of mobility and the
disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into account economic
impacts of SARS-CoV-2, optimal fighting strategies are determined and discussed. 
The study is applied to real and available data from Cameroon with a model
fitting. After several simulations, social distancing and the disinfection
frequency appear as the main elements of the optimal control strategy against
SARS-CoV-2.
