The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2) and its complications have demonstrated the devastating impact of a 
new infectious pathogen. The organisational change promulgated by the isolation
of affected communities is of extreme importance to achieve effective containment
of the contagion and good patient care. The epidemiological study of the
population of a small rural community in the North East of Italy revealed how
much the virus had circulated during Spring, 2020, and how contagion has evolved 
after a prolonged lockdown. In the 1st phase, NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification
Testing) was performed in cases with more or less severe symptoms and a study was
performed to trace the infection of family members. Only 0.2% of the population
tested positive on NAAT, via nasopharyngeal swab during this 1st phase. In the
2nd phase a random sample of the general population were tested for circulating
anti-Sars-Cov-2 immunoglobulins. This showed that approximately 97.9% of the
population were negative, while 2.1% (with positive IgG at a distance) of the
population had contracted the virus in a mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic form.
The main symptom in subjects who developed immunity was fever. Antibodies were
found in subjects with forced coexistence with quarantined or infected subjects. 
The mutual spatial distance by categories has shown higher relative prevalence of
IgG positive and IgM negative cases in close proximity but also far from the
infected, with respect to an intermediate distance. This suggests that subjects
living in thinly populated areas could come in contact with the virus more likely
due to intentional/relational proximity, while those living nearby could also be 
infected through random proximity.
