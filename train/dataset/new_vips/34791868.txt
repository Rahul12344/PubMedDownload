BACKGROUND: since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific
characteristics of the infected subjects appeared to be associated with a severe 
disease, leading to hospitalization or death.
OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the association between three components of the metabolic
syndrome (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension), alone and in
combination, and risk of hospitalization in subjects with nasopharyngeal
swab-confirmed COVID-19.
DESIGN: cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study subjects were all COVID-19 cases diagnosed in
the area of the Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan
(Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) between 10.02.2020 and 25.04.2020, whose data
were gathered with an ad hoc information system developed at the beginning of the
pandemic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the association between metabolic syndrome components
(alone and in combination) and hospitalization (both in any ward and in intensive
care unit) was measured by means of cause-specific Cox models with gender, age,
and comorbidities as potential confounders.
RESULTS: the cohort included 15,162 subjects followed from diagnosis up to
20.07.2020. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of hospitalization in any ward estimated
by the Cox model were 1.26 for uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (95%CI 1.18-1.34);
1.21 for complicated diabetes mellitus (95%CI 1.05-1.39); 1.07 for dyslipidaemia 
(95%CI 1.00-1.14); and 1.11 for hypertension (95%CI 1.05-1.17). When all
components coexisted in the same subject, the HR was 1.46 (95%CI 1.31-1.62). A
significant increase in risk of hospitalization in intensive care unit was found 
for uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (HR 1.38; 95%CI 1.15-1.66).
CONCLUSIONS: this population-based study confirms that metabolic syndrome
components increase the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. The HR increases in
an additive manner when the three components are simultaneously present.
