In June 2020, a cat from Arezzo (Italy) that died from a neurological disease was
diagnosed with West Caucasian Bat Lyssavirus (WCBV). The virus retained high
identity across the whole-genome with the reference isolate found in 2002 from a 
Russian bent-winged bat. We applied control measures recommended by national
regulations, investigated a possible interface between cats and bats using visual
inspections, bioacoustics analyses and camera trapping and performed active and
passive surveillance in bats to trace the source of infection. People that were
exposed to the cat received full post-exposure prophylaxis while animals
underwent six months of quarantine. One year later, they are all healthy. In a
tunnel located near the cat's house, we identified a group of bent-winged bats
that showed virus-neutralizing antibodies to WCBV across four sampling occasions,
but no virus in salivary swabs. Carcasses from other bat species were all
negative. This description of WCBV in a non-flying mammal confirms that this
virus can cause clinical rabies in the absence of preventive and therapeutic
measures, and highlights the lack of international guidelines against divergent
lyssaviruses. We detected bent-winged bats as the most probable source of
infection, testifying the encroachment between these bats and pets/human in urban
areas and confirming free-ranging cats as potential hazard for public health and 
conservation.
