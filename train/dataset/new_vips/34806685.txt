The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) poses a bigger
challenge to the population in tropical countries where dengue fever is also
endemic as both diseases share similar clinical and laboratory features. In
COVID-19, hyperferritinaemia is associated with severe disease and clinical
outcome while in dengue fever, hyperferritinaemia is a key feature of
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is a complication with high
mortality. In this case report, we present a case of coinfection of COVID-19 and 
dengue with hyperferritinaemia in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Sabah, Malaysia.
