BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 era is a time of unprecedented stress, and there is
widespread concern regarding its short- and long-term mental health impact.
Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of latent psychopathology
vulnerabilities, often activated by environmental stressors. The present study
examined COVID-19's impact on adolescent depression and possible influences of
different domains of social connectedness (loneliness, social media use, social
video game time, degree of social activity participation).
METHODS: A community sample of 175 adolescents (50.1% boys, mean age=16.01 years)
completed questionnaires once before and twice during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Piecewise growth modeling examined the acute (7 weeks) and persistent (8 months) 
effects of COVID-19 on depressive symptoms, and differences across sex and social
connectedness.
RESULTS: Significant increases in depressive symptoms followed pandemic onset for
boys and girls. However, this increase was earlier and more pronounced among
girls than boys, whose depression only increased significantly during the
persistent period and to a lesser degree. Trajectories of depression were
influenced by loneliness and social connections.
LIMITATIONS: Most participants had economic stability and minimal exposure to the
virus. Exacerbation of depressive symptoms may be more severe in higher risk
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent depression levels have increased during COVID-19, and are
higher for girls and those who are lonely. Enhanced screening and management for 
adolescent depression and social connectedness could play a critical role in
mitigating the negative mental health fallout of COVID-19 and future pandemics
within this population.
