Adopting telemonitoring services during the pandemic for people affected by
chronic disease is fundamental to ensure access to health care services avoiding 
the risk of COVID-19 infection. Among chronic diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease of adulthood, caused by the loss of spinal, bulbar and 
cortical motor neurons, which leads to paralysis of the voluntary muscles and,
also, involves respiratory ones. Therefore, remote monitoring and teleconsulting 
are essential services for ALS patients with limited mobility, as the disease
progresses, and for those living far from ALS centres and hospitals. In addition,
the COVID 19 pandemic has increased the need to remotely provide the best care to
patients, avoiding infection during ALS centre visits. The paper illustrates an
innovative, secure medical monitoring and teleconsultation mobile cloud-based
system for disabled people, such as those with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis). The design aims to remotely monitor biosignals, such as ECG
(electrocardiographic) and EMG (electromyographic) signals of ALS patients in
order to prevent complications related to the pathology.
