peptide sequence.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) uses e antigen (HBe), which is dispensable for virus
infectivity, to modulate host immune responses and achieve viral persistence in
human hepatocytes. The HBe precursor (p25) is directed to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), where cleavage of the signal peptide (sp) gives rise to the first
processing product, p22. P22 can be retro-translocated back to the cytosol or
enter the secretory pathway and undergo a second cleavage event, resulting in
secreted p17 (HBe). Here, we report that translocation of p25 to the ER is
promoted by translocon-associated protein complex (TRAP). We have found that p25 
is not completely translocated into the ER; a fraction of p25 is phosphorylated
and remains in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Within the p25 sp sequence, we have
identified three cysteine residues that control the efficiency of sp cleavage and
contribute to proper subcellular distribution of the precore pool.
