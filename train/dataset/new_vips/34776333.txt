The covalent attachment of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like polypeptides to cellular 
and viral proteins regulates numerous processes that enable virus infection,
viral genome replication, and the spread of viruses to new hosts. The importance 
of these protein modifications in the regulation of the life cycle of
herpesviruses is underscored by the discovery that all known members of this
virus family encode at least one protease that specifically recognizes and
disassembles ubiquitin conjugates. The structural and functional characterization
of the viral enzymes and the identification of their viral and cellular
substrates is providing valuable insights into the biology of viral infection and
increasing evidence suggests that the viral deconjugases may also play a role in 
malignant transformation.
