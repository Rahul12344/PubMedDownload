Human type A influenza viruses A(H1N1)pdm09 have caused seasonal epidemics of
influenza since the 2009-2010 pandemic. A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had a leading role
in the severe epidemic season of 2015/16 in the Northern Hemisphere and caused a 
high incidence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Ukraine. Serious
complications of influenza-associated severe ARI (SARI) were observed in the very
young and individuals at increased risk, and 391 fatal cases occurred in the
2015/16 epidemic season. We analyzed the genetic changes in the genomes of
A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses isolated from SARI cases in Ukraine during the
2015/16 season. The viral hemagglutinin (HA) fell in H1 group 6B.1 for all but
four isolates, with known mutations affecting glycosylation, the Sa antigenic
site (S162N in all 6B.1 isolates), or virulence (D222G/N in two isolates). Other 
mutations occurred in antigenic site Ca (A141P and S236P), and a subgroup of four
strains were in group 6B.2, with potential alterations to antigenicity in
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in 2015/16 in Ukraine. A cluster of Ukrainian
isolates exhibited novel D2E and N48S mutations in the RNA binding domain, and
E125D in the effector domain, of immune evasion nonstructural protein 1 (NS1).
The diverse spectrum of amino-acid substitutions in HA, NS1, and other viral
proteins including nucleoprotein (NP) and the polymerase complex suggested the
concurrent circulation of multiple lineages of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses in 
the human population in Ukraine, a country with low vaccination coverage,
complicating public health measures against influenza.
