The inhibition of surface viral glycoproteins offers great potential to hamper
the attachment of viruses to the host cells surface and the spreading of viral
infection. Mumps virus (MuV) is the etiological agent of the mumps infectious
disease and causes a wide spectrum of mild to severe symptoms due to the
inflammation of the salivary glands. Here we focus our attention on the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) isolated from MuV SBL-1 strain. We describe the 
molecular features of host sialoglycans recognition by HN protein by means of
NMR, fluorescence assays and computational studies. Furthermore, we also describe
the synthesis of a N-acetylneuraminic acid-derived thiotrisaccharide targeting
the viral protein, and the corresponding 3D-complex. Our results provide the
basis to improve the design and synthesis of potent viral
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase inhibitors.
