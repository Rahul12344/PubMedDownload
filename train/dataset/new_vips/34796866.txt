The discovery of hepatitis C virus and the research that this breakthrough
permitted defined viral RNA genome and proteins, existence of globally
distributed genotypes and creation of in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, 
and thus made it possible to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic tests and 
curative therapies. Research led to fundamental discoveries in virology and
immunology as summarized in this review, and the hope is that understanding of
virus heterogeneity, pathogenesis and neutralisation will make it possible to
achieve the ultimate goal of developing a vaccine to help control the epidemic
worldwide.
