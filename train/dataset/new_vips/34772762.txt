Research on the Issues Family Physicians Face Today: Controlled Substances,
COVID-19, Hypertension, and "Slow Medicine," Among Many More Topics.

Seehusen DA, Bowman MA, Ledford CJW.

This issue of the JABFM features research on a broad array of clinical topics.
The topics of 5 articles involve controlled substances, including a sobering
article on the risks of amphetamines in older adults. An excellent quick
reference guide for managing common COVID-19 symptoms is presented. Two other
articles consider hypertension treatment in primary care, demonstrating that
treating blood pressure is anything but straightforward. Several additional
clinical topics include mononucleosis, influenza, and the impact of home life on 
childhood weight and eating habits. A study from Virginia underscores that
primary care, as a system, is distressed. A review of the existing literature on 
"slow medicine" comes to important conclusions. Some health systems are
partnering with local resources to practically address such social determinants
as food insecurity. Not surprisingly, family physicians are filling gaps in
emergency care around the country.
