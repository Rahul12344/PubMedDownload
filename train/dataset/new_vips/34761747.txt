An 18-year-old man with no previous known risk factors of thromboembolic diseases
had both symptoms and radiologic findings of a superior sagittal sinus thrombosis
one month after asymptomatic covid-19 infection. This case report aims to inform,
that sinus thrombosis is a possible complication of a covid-19 infection, and
hence, this complication should be considered in adolescents with an asymptomatic
presentation of the infection.
