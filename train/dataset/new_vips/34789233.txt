BACKGROUND: Pharmacy practice education requires the development of proficiencies
and an understanding of clinical microbiology. Learning in this area could be
delivered using practical laboratory exercises, or potentially, simulation-based 
education. Simulation has previously successfully enhanced learning in health
professional education. The current global climate due to COVID-19 has further
highlighted the important role of technology-enhanced learning in delivering
outcomes that meet the requisite learning objectives of a course. The aim of the 
present study was to compare the impact of a commercially available virtual
microbiology simulation (VUMIE™) with a traditional wet laboratory (wetlab) on
learner knowledge, skills and confidence in a second-year integrated
pharmacotherapeutics course for Bachelor of Pharmacy students.
METHODS: A randomised, crossover study was employed to determine whether the
simulation intervention (VUMIE™) improves learning outcomes (knowledge, skills
and confidence) of pharmacy students, when compared to a traditional wetlab
intervention. Each student completed three 1-2 h length sessions, for both the
wetlab and VUMIE™ interventions (6 sessions total). Data was collected using
surveys deployed at baseline (pre-interventions), post-intervention 1 or 2
(VUMIE™ or wetlab) and endpoint (post-interventions 1 and 2). Statistical
analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics 25 and Instat™ software.
RESULTS: Response rates were approximately 50% at initial survey and
approximately 25% at endpoint survey. VUMIE™ produced higher post-intervention
knowledge scores for the multiple-choice questions compared to the wetlab,
however, the highest score was achieved at endpoint. Both interventions produced 
statistically significant differences for mean scores compared to baseline
(pre-VUMIE™ and wetlab) across the domains of knowledge, skills and confidence.
VUMIE™ produced higher post-intervention mean scores for knowledge, skills and
confidence compared to post-intervention mean scores for the wetlab, however
there was no statistical significance between the mean score for the two
interventions, thus the VUMIE™ activity produced learning outcomes comparable to 
the wetlab activity.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest VUMIE™ provides similar effects on students'
knowledge, skills, and confidence as a wetlab. The simulation's implementation
was not cost-prohibitive, provided students with a physically and psychologically
safe learning environment, and the benefit of being able to repeat activities,
supporting deliberate practice.
