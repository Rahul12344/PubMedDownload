What is the impact of COVID-19 on South Africa? This paper envisages to assist
researchers in battling of the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on South Africa. This
paper focuses on the spread of the disease by applying heatmap retrieval of
hotspot areas, and spatial analysis is carried out using the Moran index. For
capturing spatial autocorrelation between the provinces of South Africa, the
adjacent as well as the geographical distance measures are used as weight matrix 
for both absolute and relative counts. Furthermore, generalized logistic growth
curve modelling is used for prediction of the COVID-19 spread. We expect this
data-driven modelling to provide some insights into hotspot identification and
timeous action controlling the spread of the virus.
