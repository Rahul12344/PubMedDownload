Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health issue
around the world. Health care workers (HCWs) are at high risk of HBV infection
because they have direct contact with HBV infected blood and body fluids in their
work.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and
practice (KAP) of HCWs towards hepatitis B infection in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 502 HCWs, between November
2018 and January 2019 by a simple random sampling method. The data was collected 
through a self-administered structured questionnaire. Using this questionnaire,
demographic characteristics and KAP of HCWs was assessed. In addition,
descriptive and inferential analyses was conducted on the collected data using
SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results: The overall KAP scores of HCWs were found to be 86.58%, 34.73%, and
61.22%, respectively. Most of the participants correctly recognized the HBV
infection. Among the participants, only 77.45% had undergone screening for HBV,
and 56.37% had received HBV vaccine (p < 0.0001). Moreover, only 6.77% had
completed the three doses of vaccination for HBV. Among the HCWs, the group with 
higher education level had better knowledge than the group with lower education
level. However, the attitude of most of the participants towards HBV prevention
was found to be inadequate (53.98%).
Conclusion: This study shows that HCWs in Kabul, Afghanistan are at high risk of 
HBV infection due to low vaccination coverage and inadequate infection control.
Therefore, we strongly encourage providing an accessible and compulsory
vaccination program for all HCWs to improve their attitude and awareness towards 
HBV infection and to achieve effective infection control.
