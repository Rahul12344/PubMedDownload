The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to stretch the healthcare
systems and the workforce alike, both nationally and internationally. This is
equally true of the dental care systems and the dental workforce which had to
respond and act promptly.This paper examines the perceived impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of dental teams in the UK and
provides insight into not only this impact, but the early signs of mental ill
health commonly triggered by life events, anxiety and fear, and often exacerbated
by stresses. A sample of an established body of literature and recognised sources
are considered. Finally, extracts of common threads from meaningful conversations
will be alluded to, shining a light on the current state of the mental health and
wellbeing of many in dentistry and the need for intervention and longer-term
plans. We are often reminded that this period in time is a marathon not a sprint,
the same could perhaps be said about a national response to mental health and
wellbeing, as it will take time, but the time to begin is now.
