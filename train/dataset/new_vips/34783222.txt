BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (BKPyVAN) is a common cause of allograft
failure. However, differentiation between BKPyVAN and type I T cell-mediated
rejection (TCMR) is challenging when simian virus 40 (SV40) staining is negative,
because of the similarities in histopathology. This study investigated whether
donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) can be used to differentiate BKPyVAN.
Target region capture sequencing was applied to detect the ddcfDNAs of 12
recipients with stable graft function, 22 with type I TCMR, 21 with proven
BKPyVAN, and 5 with possible PyVAN. We found that urinary ddcfDNA levels were
upregulated in recipients with graft injury, whereas plasma ddcfDNA levels were
comparable for all groups. The median urinary concentrations and fractions of
ddcfDNA in proven BKPyVAN recipients were significantly higher than those in type
I TCMR recipients (10.4 vs. 6.1 ng/mL, P<0.001 and 68.4% vs. 55.3%, P=0.013,
respectively). Urinary ddcfDNA fractions (not concentrations) were higher in the 
BKPyVAN-pure subgroup than in the BKPyVAN-rejection-like subgroup (81.30% vs.
56.64%, P=0.025). With a cut-off value of 7.81 ng/mL, urinary ddcfDNA
concentrations distinguished proven BKPyVAN from type I TCMR (area under the
curve (AUC)=0.848, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.734 to 0.963). These
findings suggest that urinary ddcfDNA is a non-invasive biomarker which can
reliably differentiate BKPyVAN from type I TCMR.
