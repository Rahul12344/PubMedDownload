PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of
histopathologically confirmed ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in
clinically diagnosed pterygium samples at a tertiary center in Northern
California, over a 10-year period (2009-2019).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients older than 18 years with
clinically diagnosed benign pterygium requiring excision was conducted.
Clinically suspected pterygia were excised using standard techniques and
routinely submitted to the University of California Davis for pathologic
evaluation. Demographic, clinical, surgical, and pathological information were
recorded and analyzed. The prevalence rate of OSSN was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 348 consecutive specimens were evaluated. The mean (±SD) age 
of the patients was 58 ± 12 years, with a near equal sex representation. A total 
of 57 (16%) pterygia were recurrent at initial presentation. Histopathologic
results demonstrated a single case of OSSN. This patient did not have a
documented history of carcinoma in other organs or any history of herpes virus,
human papilloma virus, or human immunodeficiency virus infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of histopathological OSSN in clinically suspected
pterygia within our sample was approximately 0.3%. Because of shared clinical
characteristics of pterygia and OSSN, a high index of suspicion and judicious use
of anterior segment optical coherence tomography enable for effective
preoperative diagnosis of OSSN. However, in the absence of clinical expertise or 
high-resolution optical coherence tomography, routine tissue pathologic
examination may be warranted.
