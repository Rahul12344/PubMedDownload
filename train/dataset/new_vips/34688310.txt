BACKGROUND: Humicola insolens is a filamentous fungus with high potential of
producing neutral and heat- and alkali-resistant cellulase. However, the genetic 
engineering tools, particularly the genome-editing tool, are scarce, hindering
the study of cellulase expression regulation in this organism.
RESULTS: Herein, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system was established in H.
insolens based on a hybrid 5S rRNA-tRNAGly promoter. This system is superior to
the HDV (hepatitis delta virus) system in genome editing, allowing highly
efficient single gene destruction in H. insolens with rates of deletion up to
84.1% (37/44). With this system, a putative pigment synthesis gene pks and the
transcription factor xyr1 gene were disrupted with high efficiency. Moreover, the
extracellular protein concentration and cellulase activity largely decreased when
xyr1 was deleted, demonstrating for the first time that Xyr1 plays an important
role in cellulase expression regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The established CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genetic operation
tool for H. insolens, which will accelerate studies on the regulation mechanism
of cellulase expression and engineering of H. insolens for higher cellulase
production.
