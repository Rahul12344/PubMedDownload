OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the severity of COVID-19 in cancer patients to describe
clinical and epidemiological factors associated with poor outcomes (mortality and
need of intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation).
METHODS: Retrospective data from patients with cancer and laboratory diagnosis of
COVID-19, obtained between March 16 and May 29, 2020, were retrieved out of a
cancer center database. Data analyzed included patient history, age, sex,
comorbidities, types of cancer and anticancer therapy.
RESULTS: This sample comprised 105 patients aged 18-92 years, 80.9% of whom were 
females. Dyspnea was the most prevalent initial symptom (30.4%) among patients
who died (p<0.0001). Overall, 57.1% of patients had metastatic disease and 60%
had poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group ≥2) at the time 
of COVID-19 diagnosis. The overall mortality rate was 40.95%. Mortality rates
were higher in male patients and those with poor performance status (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This cohort is one of the largest Brazilian studies describing
clinical and epidemiological features of patients with cancer and concurrent
COVID-19. Findings of this study emphasize the vulnerability of cancer patients
in the current pandemic, and indicate high mortality from COVID-19 among male
cancer patients and cancer patients with poor performance status. This analysis
may assist the selection of patients who may benefit from strict isolation and
eventual discontinuation of anticancer therapy to reduce exposure to infection.
