OBJECTIVE: Oral melanotic hyperpigmentation (OMH) in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been attributed to the use of
antifungal or antiretroviral drugs, as well as HIV-induced cytokine
dysregulation. This research aimed to determine the relationship between
immunosuppression and cytokine dysregulation in newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive 
subjects with OMH.
STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted among newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive
patients at the Infectious Disease Clinic, Ibadan, Nigeria. The cases were
patients with OMH matched for age and sex with control subjects without OMH. CD4+
count and cytokine levels (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) were
compared between the cases and control subjects. SPSS version 21 software was
used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Seventy newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive patients were studied, which
comprised of 35 cases and 35 control subjects. The median CD4+ counts for cases
and control subjects were 174 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 57-250) and
324 cells/mm3 (IQR, 107-424), respectively. Severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count,
≤200 cells/mm3) was found in over half of the study participants, being more
prevalent among the cases than among the control group (P = .019). Serum cytokine
levels did not significantly vary between the cases and control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant association between HIV-OMH and severe
immunosuppression in the newly diagnosed HIV-seropositive patients.
