We describe two cases of acquired parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance consequent
to the development of serum PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1R) autoantibodies, which
block PTH binding and signaling. Both cases were associated with other autoimmune
manifestations, and one case was associated with atypical membranous
glomerulonephritis. In vitro binding and signaling assays identified the presence
of PTH1R-blocking IgG autoantibodies, which were not present in serum samples
from patients with other renal or autoimmune disorders. (Funded by the Intramural
