Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) attacks pulmonary
alveolar cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and causes
pulmonary infections that result in coronavirus disease (COVID-19), inducing
immune responses that can result in severe pneumonia. We reviewed the clinical
experiences of lung diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic to offer insights into 
the adaptations made by experts in the diagnosis and treatment of these
comorbidities. Various lung comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 and
associated mortality by amplifying ACE2 expression. Additionally, the COVID-19
pandemic has changed the use of routine diagnostic pulmonary imaging methods,
making chest sonography scoring the most convenient, as it can be conducted
bedside. Treatment protocols for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the underlying lung
diseases are also affected owing to potential interactions. The optimal
diagnostic methods and treatment protocols for lung diseases have been adapted
worldwide to increase survival rates and attenuate acute lung injuries during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
