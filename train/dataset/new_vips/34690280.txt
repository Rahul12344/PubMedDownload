OBJECTIVE: HIV alters host responses to hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, the
impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) of HIV is rarely understood in relevant
tissues and never before within individual hepatocytes.
DESIGN: HIV and HCV kinetics were studied before and after ART initiation among
19 HIV/HCV co-infected persons. From five persons with the largest decline in
plasma HCV RNA, liver tissues collected before and during ART, when plasma HIV
RNA was undetectable, were studied.
METHODS: We used single-cell laser capture microdissection and quantitative PCR
to assess intrahepatic HCV. Immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize
intrahepatic immune cell populations.
RESULTS: Plasma HCV RNA declined by 0.81 (0.52-1.60) log10 IU/mL from a median
(range) 7.26 (6.05-7.29) log10 IU/mL and correlated with proportions of
HCV-infected hepatocytes (r = 0.89, p = 2x10-5), which declined from median
(range) of 37% (6-49%) to 23% (0.5-52%) after plasma HIV clearance. Median
(range) HCV RNA abundance within cells was unchanged in 4/5 participants. Liver T
cell abundance unexpectedly decreased, whereas NK and NK T cell infiltration
increased, correlating with changes in proportions of HCV-infected hepatocytes
(r = -0.82 and r = -0.73, respectively). Hepatocyte-expression of HLA-E, an NK
cell restriction marker, correlated with proportions of HCV-infected hepatocytes 
(r = 0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to show that ART control of HIV reduces the
intrahepatic burden of HCV. Furthermore, our data suggest that HIV affects the
pathogenesis of HCV infection by an NK/NK T cell mediated mechanism that may
involve HLA-E and can be rescued, at least in part, by ART.
