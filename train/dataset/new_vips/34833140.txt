Virome-a part of a microbiome-is a term used to describe all viruses found in the
specific organism or system. Recently, as new technologies emerged, it has been
confirmed that kidneys and the lower urinary tract are colonized not only by the 
previously described viruses, but also completely novel species. Viruses can be
both pathogenic and protective, as they often carry important virulence factors, 
while at the same time represent anti-inflammatory functions. This paper aims to 
show and compare the viral species detected in various, specific clinical
conditions. Because of the unique characteristics of viruses, new sequencing
techniques and databases had to be developed to conduct research on the urinary
virome. The dynamic development of research on the human microbiome suggests that
the detailed studies on the urinary system virome will provide answers to many
questions about the risk factors for civilization, cancer, and autoimmune
diseases.
