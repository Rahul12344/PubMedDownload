BACKGROUND: Viral infections are causing significant morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Understanding the interaction patterns between a particular virus and 
human proteins plays a crucial role in unveiling the underlying mechanism of
viral infection and pathogenesis. This could further help in prevention and
treatment of virus-related diseases. However, the task of predicting
protein-protein interactions between a new virus and human cells is extremely
challenging due to scarce data on virus-human interactions and fast mutation
rates of most viruses.
RESULTS: We developed a multitask transfer learning approach that exploits the
information of around 24 million protein sequences and the interaction patterns
from the human interactome to counter the problem of small training datasets.
Instead of using hand-crafted protein features, we utilize statistically rich
protein representations learned by a deep language modeling approach from a
massive source of protein sequences. Additionally, we employ an additional
objective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human
protein-protein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a
regularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the
virus-human protein-protein interaction prediction model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets
and the case study for the SARS-COV-2 virus receptor. Experimental results show
that our proposed model works effectively for both virus-human and bacteria-human
protein-protein interaction prediction tasks. We share our code for
reproducibility and future research at
