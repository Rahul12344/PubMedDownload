Background: Within a short duration, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread
globally, affecting all facets of life and causing widespread panic. This study
set out to assess the perception and practices towards COVID-19 of urban and
rural residents in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study design and multistaged sampling
technique were used. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered
questionnaire between October and December 2020. Scores assessing perception and 
practices were allocated and graded based on specific stratified demarcations. P 
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: A total of 822 individuals from the selected households were interviewed
(urban: 401, 48.8%; rural: 421, 51.2%). Majority of respondents urban (99.8%) and
rural (97.9%) were aware of COVID-19. Most respondents had low risk-perception of
COVID-19 (62.4%), with significantly more rural respondents having low-risk
perception (70.6% rural vs. 54.0% urban). The general perception of COVID-19
amongst the respondents was good (79.2%) with no statistically significant
difference between urban and rural residents. Most of the participants had good
practices towards COVID-19, with significantly higher proportion of urban
respondents having good practice (93.8%) compared to their rural counterparts
(83.1%). Amongst rural residents, high-risk perception was associated with higher
proportion of good practice (93.4%) compared to 84.5% of low-risk perception (P =
0.015).
Conclusions: The participants had high level of awareness, low risk perception,
good general perception and good practices toward COVID-19. However, urban
respondents showed better practices towards COVID-19. More attention should be
directed towards improving COVID-19 perception and practices particularly amongst
rural residents.
