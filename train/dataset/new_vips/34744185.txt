In the rapidly growing COVID-19 pandemic, designing of new drugs and evaluating
their inhibitory action against main targets of corona virus could be an
effective strategy to accelerate the drug discovery process and their efficacy
towards corona virus disease. Herein, we design new bis-triazolyl probe for an
investigation of inhibitory activity towards COVID-19 main protease by Molecular 
docking approach. The formulated compound has been thoroughly characterized by
elemental analysis, NMR (1H and 13C) and complete structure elucidation was
achieved via X-ray crystallography. Docking study reveals that newly synthesized 
compound confers good inhibitory response to COVID-19 main protease as supported 
by calculated docking score and binding energy. Strong hydrogen bonding and
hydrophobic interactions of the newly synthesized compound with several important
amino acids of the main protease also helps to explain the potency of the
compound to inhibit the main protease. We hope that the present study would help 
the researcher in the field of Medicinal chemistry and to develop potential drug 
against the novel corona virus.
