Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis-is
a significant cause of serious illness among young children between the ages of
0-5 years and is especially concerning in the first year of life. Globally, RSV
is a common cause of childhood acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) and a major
cause of hospital admissions in young children and infants and represents a
substantial burden for health-care systems. This burden is strongly felt as there
are currently no effective preventative options that are available for all
infants. However, a renaissance in RSV prevention strategies is unfolding, with
several new prophylactic options such as monoclonal antibodies and maternal
vaccinations that are soon to be available. A key concern is that health decision
makers and systems may not be ready to take full advantage of forthcoming
technological innovations. A multi-stakeholder approach is necessary to bridge
data gaps to fully utilise upcoming options. Knowledge must be made available at 
multiple levels to ensure that parents and doctors are aware of preventative
options, but also to ensure that stakeholders and policymakers are given the
necessary information to best advise implementation strategies.
