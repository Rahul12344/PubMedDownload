Programmable nucleases have enabled rapid and accessible genome engineering in
eukaryotic cells and living organisms. However, their delivery into human blood
cells can be challenging. Here, we have utilized "nanoblades," a new technology
that delivers a genomic cleaving agent into cells. These are modified murine
leukemia virus (MLV) or HIV-derived virus-like particle (VLP), in which the viral
structural protein Gag has been fused to Cas9. These VLPs are thus loaded with
Cas9 protein complexed with the guide RNAs. Highly efficient gene editing was
obtained in cell lines, IPS and primary mouse and human cells. Here, we showed
that nanoblades were remarkably efficient for entry into human T, B, and
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) thanks to their surface
co-pseudotyping with baboon retroviral and VSV-G envelope glycoproteins. A brief 
incubation of human T and B cells with nanoblades incorporating two gRNAs
resulted in 40 and 15% edited deletion in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene
locus, respectively. CD34+ cells (HSPCs) treated with the same nanoblades allowed
30-40% exon 1 drop-out in the WAS gene locus. Importantly, no toxicity was
detected upon nanoblade-mediated gene editing of these blood cells. Finally, we
also treated HSPCs with nanoblades in combination with a donor-encoding rAAV6
vector resulting in up to 40% of stable expression cassette knock-in into the WAS
gene locus. Summarizing, this new technology is simple to implement, shows high
flexibility for different targets including primary immune cells of human and
murine origin, is relatively inexpensive and therefore gives important prospects 
for basic and clinical translation in the area of gene therapy.
