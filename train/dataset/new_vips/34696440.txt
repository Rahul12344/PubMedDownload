The evolution of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 at antigenic sites that impact
neutralizing antibody responses in humans poses a risk to immunity developed
through vaccination and natural infection. The highly successful RNA-based
vaccines have enabled rapid vaccine updates that incorporate mutations from
current variants of concern (VOCs). It is therefore important to anticipate
future antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global
landscape of host immunity. Toward this goal, we survey epitope-paratope
interfaces of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to map an antigenic space that captures 
the role of each spike protein residue within the polyclonal antibody response
directed against the ACE2-receptor binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain 
(NTD). In particular, the antigenic space map builds on recently published
epitope definitions by annotating epitope overlap and orthogonality at the
residue level. We employ the antigenic space map as a framework to understand how
mutations on nine major variants contribute to each variant's evasion of
neutralizing antibodies. Further, we identify constellations of mutations that
span the orthogonal epitope regions of the RBD and NTD on the variants with the
greatest antibody escape. Finally, we apply the antigenic space map to predict
which regions of antigenic space-should they mutate-may be most likely to
complementarily augment antibody evasion for the most evasive and transmissible
VOCs.
