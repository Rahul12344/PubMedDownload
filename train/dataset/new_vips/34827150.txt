The phenotype of an attenuated live vaccine depends on gene mutation achieved by,
for example, many passages in cultured cells. Viral clones with preferable
phenotypes are selected and the causative genetic mutation(s) are later
identified. LC16m8 is an example of a highly attenuated smallpox vaccine that was
developed and licensed in Japan in the 1970s. LC16m8 was obtained by the
passaging of Lister strain, with indicators of small plaque formation and
temperature sensitivity as virus phenotypes. This strain can replicate in
mammalian cells and provides robust cellular and humoral immunity, as well as
long-term immune memory. Recent studies using proteome-wide antigen arrays have
revealed that antibody production against LC16m8 and other VACVs differs largely 
among individuals. Moreover, associations between SNPs in immune-related genes
and immune outcomes have been increasingly found. These results lead to
predicting adverse events of a vaccine, which is a purpose of vaccinomics.
Studies on VACV will continue to contribute to the understanding of host-pathogen
interactions and to development of a vaccine for other infectious and
non-infectious diseases. Here, we review studies of VACV, including our recent
research on LC16m8, with a focus on the phenotype and genotype, and we discuss
future research directions.
