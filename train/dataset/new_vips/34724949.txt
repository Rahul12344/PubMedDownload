BACKGROUND: Patient experience of nursing care is associated with safety, care
quality, treatment outcomes, costs and service use. Effective nursing care
includes meeting patients' fundamental physical, relational and psychosocial
needs, which may be compromised by the challenges of SARS-CoV-2. No
evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients with SARS-CoV-2. We report
work to develop such a guideline. Our aim was to identify views and experiences
of nursing staff on necessary nursing care for inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 (not
invasively ventilated) that is omitted or delayed (missed care) and any barriers 
to this care.
METHODS: We conducted an online mixed methods survey structured according to the 
Fundamentals of Care Framework. We recruited a convenience sample of UK-based
nursing staff who had nursed inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 not invasively
ventilated. We asked respondents to rate how well they were able to meet the
needs of SARS-CoV-2 patients, compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 patients, in 15 care
categories; select from a list of barriers to care; and describe examples of
missed care and barriers to care. We analysed quantitative data descriptively and
qualitative data using Framework Analysis, integrating data in side-by-side
comparison tables.
RESULTS: Of 1062 respondents, the majority rated mobility, talking and listening,
non-verbal communication, communicating with significant others, and emotional
wellbeing as worse for patients with SARS-CoV-2. Eight barriers were ranked
within the top five in at least one of the three care areas. These were (in rank 
order): wearing Personal Protective Equipment, the severity of patients'
conditions, inability to take items in and out of isolation rooms without donning
and doffing Personal Protective Equipment, lack of time to spend with patients,
lack of presence from specialised services e.g. physiotherapists, lack of
knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, insufficient stock, and reluctance to spend time with
patients for fear of catching SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our respondents identified nursing care areas likely to be missed
for patients with SARS-CoV-2, and barriers to delivering care. We are currently
evaluating a guideline of nursing strategies to address these barriers, which are
unlikely to be exclusive to this pandemic or the environments represented by our 
respondents. Our results should, therefore, be incorporated into global pandemic 
planning.
