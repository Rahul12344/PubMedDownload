Different datasets have been deployed at national level to share data on COVID-19
already at the beginning of the epidemic spread in early 2020. They distribute
daily updated information aggregated at local, gender and age levels. To
facilitate the reuse of such data, FAIR principles should be applied to optimally
find, access, understand and exchange them, to define intra- and inter-country
analyses for different purposes, such as statistical. However, another aspect to 
be considered when analyzing these datasets is data quality. In this paper we
link these two perspectives to analyze to what extent datasets published by
national institutions to monitor diffusion of COVID-19 are reusable for
scientific purposes, such as tracing the spread of the virus.
