Globally and in all age groups, noroviruses are a main cause of gastroenteritis. 
To assess their local epidemiology and genetic diversity, stool samples of 7509
inpatients with gastrointestinal complaints from all age groups were analyzed.
After detection of norovirus genogroup I and II RNA by real-time RT-PCR, viral
capsids were genotyped by partial nucleic acid sequencing. In the case of GII.2
strains, polymerase genotypes were also assessed. Between October 2013 and
September 2017, presence of norovirus RNA was shown in 611 samples (8.1%), of
which 610 (99.8%) were typed successfully. Norovirus positivity rate was higher
in patients aged below five years (14.8%) than in older patients (5.7%). Among
the 611 norovirus positive samples, GII.4 (56.6%) strains prevailed, followed by 
GII.6 (11.3%), GII.3 (11.0%) and GII.2 (9.5%). The most common genogroup I (GGI) 
genotype was GI.3 (3.6%). In addition, rare genotypes such as GII.13, GII.14 and 
GII.26 were detected. Interestingly, GII.3 infections were most common in
children under the age of five years. Assessment of polymerase genotypes in GII.2
viruses showed a shift from P2 to P16, with higher diversity in P2 sequences. The
varying distribution of norovirus genotypes depending on season, age and setting 
of infection highlights the importance of frequent genotyping as a basis for
vaccine development and needful adjustments.
