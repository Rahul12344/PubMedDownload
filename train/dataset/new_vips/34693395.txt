The World Health Organization has called for the global elimination of cervical
cancer. While high income countries have made significant progress, the incidence
and mortality due to cervical cancer is unacceptably high in low and middle
income countries (LMIC). Jamaica is an upper middle income country with cervical 
cancer incidence and mortality of 21.6/100,000 and 13.6/100,000 person years
respectively compared to 14.9/100,000 and 7.6/100,000 person years in Latin
America and the Caribbean. Jamaica's pathway to reducing the burden of cervical
cancer highlights challenges and opportunities for other LMIC. High prevalence of
HPV infection (54% women attending primary care clinics), low levels of cervical 
cancer screening (<50% women 15 to 54 years old screened in the last 3 years) and
suboptimal uptake of HPV vaccination (approximately 30%) are persistent barriers 
to achieving this goal. Lessons learned from the response to the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic confirm the need for serious political
commitment by global and national leaders, meaningful engagement of stakeholders 
and innovative strategies to improve uptake of HPV vaccination and cervical
cancer screening. Commitment of technical and financial resources are critical
for establishing robust cancer registries and strengthening monitoring and
evaluation systems in LMIC.
