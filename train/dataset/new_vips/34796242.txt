Background: Immunocompromised patients show prolonged shedding of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swabs. We
report a case of prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with
clinical relapses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with mantle
cell lymphoma who underwent treatment with rituximab, bendamustine, cytarabine
with consequent lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 5 positive nasopharyngeal swabs,
we performed viral culture and next-generation sequencing. We analyzed the
patient's adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T- and NK-cell subsets.
Results: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive for 
268 days. All 5 performed viral cultures were positive, and genomic analysis
confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive 
in 3 out of 4 COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir
treatment. The T- and NK-cell dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic
samples, and no SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected throughout the
disease course.
Conclusions: In our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for >8 
months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses, and remdesivir treatment
was effective in viremia clearance and symptom remission, although it was unable 
to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, 
we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral
blood; these are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication.
In addition, we found a high level of NK-cell repertoire perturbation with
relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.
