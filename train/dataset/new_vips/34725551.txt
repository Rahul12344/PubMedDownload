Aedes aegypti is the main vector of the dengue virus in Colombia. Some factors
have been associated with its presence; however, in the local context, it has not
been sufficiently evaluated. The present study seeks to identify the
socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors associated with the presence
and abundance of A. aegypti in urban dwellings in the municipality of Castilla la
Nueva. A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted in houses in the urban area
of the municipality of Castilla la Nueva, where 307 houses were sampled by
systematic random sampling during May 2018. A multifactorial survey was used to
measure the socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors as explanatory
variables. The infestation and relative abundance were established by the
presence of larval stages and ovitraps. The associated factors for the presence
and abundance of A. aegypti were identified using negative binomial and logistic 
regression models. A positive housing infestation of 33.2% was identified by
direct inspection and 78.5% with ovitraps. The main factors positively associated
with the presence and abundance of A. aegypti were one-story homes (PR = 2.26;
95% CI: 1.31-3.87), the storage of water for domestic use (PR = 1.91; 95% CI:
1.18-3.09), and local conditions such as disorganized backyard (PR = 79.95; 95%
CI: 10.96-583.24) and the proportion of shade greater than 50% of the backyard
(PR = 62.32; 95% CI: 6.47-600.32). And, it is negatively associated with
residential gas service (PR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.16-0.58) and self-administered
internal fumigation (PR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.2-0.69). The presence and abundance of 
A. aegypti were explained by interrelated socioeconomic, environmental, and
behavioral factors where local conditions and habits such as the organization of 
the patio, knowledge about vector biology, and cleaning containers are identified
as main topics for future prevention strategies for the transmission of dengue in
the local and national context.
