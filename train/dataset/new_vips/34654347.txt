INTRODUCTION: Human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in providing protective
responses against pathogens, particularly by regulating immune system
homeostasis. There is a reciprocal interaction between the gut and lung
microbiota, called the gut-lung axis (GLA). Any alteration in the gut microbiota 
or their metabolites can cause immune dysregulation, which can impair the
antiviral activity of the immune system against respiratory viruses such as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
AREAS COVERED: This narrative review mainly outlines emerging data on the
mechanisms underlying the interactions between the immune system and intestinal
microbial dysbiosis, which is caused by an imbalance in the levels of essential
metabolites. The authors will also discuss the role of probiotics in restoring
the balance of the gut microbiota and modulation of cytokine storm.
EXPERT OPINION: Microbiota-derived signals regulate the immune system and protect
different tissues during severe viral respiratory infections. The GLA's
equilibration could help manage the mortality and morbidity rates associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
