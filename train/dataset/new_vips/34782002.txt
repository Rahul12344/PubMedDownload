BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) owing to its similarity to the previous severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), is characterized by causing, in most patients,
nonspecific symptoms similar to those of the common flu. It has been reported
that many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presented neurological
symptoms that involve the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition,
there have been several reports of patients who presented Guillain-Barré syndrome
related to  COVID-19 , with sensory and motor compromise in the extremities.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe a rare case of Guillain-Barré
syndrome in a 50-year-old Hispanic male with bilateral facial palsy as the only
neurological manifestation, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A complete
neurophysiological study showed severe axonal neuropathy of the right and left
facial nerves.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of severity, clinicians must to be aware of any
neurological manifestation generated by COVID-19 and start performing more
neurophysiological tests to determine if the infection induces an axonal, myelin,
or mixed involvement of the peripheral nervous system.
