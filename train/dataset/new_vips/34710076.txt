In mid-June 2021, B.1.671.2 (Delta) became the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2,
the virus that causes COVID-19, circulating in the United States. As of July
2021, the Delta variant was responsible for nearly all new SARS-CoV-2 infections 
in the United States.* The Delta variant is more transmissible than previously
circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (1); however, whether it causes more severe
disease in adults has been uncertain. Data from the CDC COVID-19-Associated
Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a population-based surveillance
system for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, were used to examine trends in
severe outcomes in adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 during periods before (January-June 2021) and during (July-August 2021) 
Delta variant predominance. COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among all
adults declined during January-June 2021 (pre-Delta period), before increasing
during July-August 2021 (Delta period). Among sampled nonpregnant hospitalized
COVID-19 patients with completed medical record abstraction and a discharge
disposition during the pre-Delta period, the proportion of patients who were
admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), received invasive mechanical
ventilation (IMV), or died while hospitalized did not significantly change from
the pre-Delta period to the Delta period. The proportion of hospitalized COVID-19
patients who were aged 18-49 years significantly increased, from 24.7% (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 23.2%-26.3%) of all hospitalizations in the pre-Delta 
period, to 35.8% (95% CI = 32.1%-39.5%, p<0.01) during the Delta period. When
examined by vaccination status, 71.8% of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in 
the Delta period were in unvaccinated adults. Adults aged 18-49 years accounted
for 43.6% (95% CI = 39.1%-48.2%) of all hospitalizations among unvaccinated
adults during the Delta period. No difference was observed in ICU admission,
receipt of IMV, or in-hospital death among nonpregnant hospitalized adults
between the pre-Delta and Delta periods. However, the proportion of unvaccinated 
adults aged 18-49 years hospitalized with COVID-19 has increased as the Delta
variant has become more predominant. Lower vaccination coverage in this age group
likely contributed to the increase in hospitalized patients during the Delta
period. COVID-19 vaccination is critical for all eligible adults, including those
aged <50 years who have relatively low vaccination rates compared with older
adults.
