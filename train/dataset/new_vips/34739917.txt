Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious intestinal disease which
mostly caused by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV). The PED has caused huge 
economic losses to the pig industry all over the world and a valid PEDV vaccine
is needed to prevent the infection. In this study, we constructed expression
plasmid based on the spike (S) gene of the epidemic PEDV strain. The recombinant 
eukaryotic S (Se) and prokaryotic S (Sp) subunit proteins were expressed and
purified as vaccine antigens. We designed a new subunit vaccine based on S
proteins, adjuvanted with layered double hydroxide (LDH). The results indicated
that the LDH adjuvanted subunit vaccines induced a better immune effect in terms 
of antibody level and cellular immune response. In conclusion, this study showed 
a new design of a PEDV subunit vaccine with nanotechnology and demonstrated the
potential for its clinical application.
