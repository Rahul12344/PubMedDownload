BACKGROUND: Risk factors of severe COVID-19 have mainly been investigated in the 
hospital setting. We investigated pre-defined risk factors for testing positive
for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular or pulmonary complications in the
outpatient setting.
METHODS: The present cohort study makes use of ambulatory claims data of
statutory health insurance physicians in Bavaria, Germany, with polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) test confirmed or excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection in first three
quarters of 2020. Statistical modelling and machine learning were used for effect
estimation and for hypothesis testing of risk factors, and for prognostic
modelling of cardiovascular or pulmonary complications.
RESULTS: A cohort of 99 811 participants with PCR test was identified. In a fully
adjusted multivariable regression model, dementia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36), type 
2 diabetes (OR = 1.14) and obesity (OR = 1.08) were identified as significantly
associated with a positive PCR test result. Significant risk factors for
cardiovascular or pulmonary complications were coronary heart disease (CHD) (OR =
2.58), hypertension (OR = 1.65), tobacco consumption (OR = 1.56), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 1.53), previous pneumonia (OR = 1.53),
chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 1.25) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.23). Three
simple decision rules derived from prognostic modelling based on age,
hypertension, CKD, COPD and CHD were able to identify high risk patients with a
sensitivity of 74.8% and a specificity of 80.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: The decision rules achieved a high prognostic accuracy non-inferior 
to complex machine learning methods. They might help to identify patients at
risk, who should receive special attention and intensified protection in
ambulatory care.
