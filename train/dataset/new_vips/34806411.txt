Repeat dosing poses a major hurdle for the development of an AAV-based gene
therapy for CF, in part because of the potential for development of an immune
reaction to the AAV1 capsid proteins. Here, to dampen the immune response to
AAV1, we treated Rhesus monkeys with methylprednisolone prior to and following
the instillation of two doses of AAV1Î”27-264-CFTR into their airways at 0 and 30 
days, followed by a single dose of AAV1-GFP on day 60. Animals were euthanized on
day 90, except for one monkey that was sacrificed at one year. No adverse events 
occurred, indicating that the two AAV1 vectors are safe. rAAV1-CFTR and AAV1-GFP 
vector genomes and mRNA transcripts were detectable in all lung sections and in
the liver and pancreas at day 90 and after one year at levels comparable to
animals necropsied at 90da. The numbers of vector genomes for CFTR and GFP
detected here were higher than in the monkeys infected without methylprednisolone
treatment that we tested previously 1. Also, lung surface and keratin 5-positive 
basal cells showed higher CFTR and GFP staining than did the cells from the
uninfected monkey control. Positive immunostaining, also detected in the liver
and pancreas, remained stable for at least a year. All animals seroconverted for 
anti-capsid antibodies by 90 days post-treatment. The neutralizing antibody titer
declined in the animal necropsied at one year. Conclusion: AAV1 safely and
effectively transduces monkey airway and basal cells. Both the presence of vector
genomes and transduction from AAV1-CFTR and AAV1-GFP virus seen in the mon-keys 4
months to one year after the first instillation suggest that repeat dosing with
AAV1-based vectors is achievable, particularly following methylprednisolone
treatment.
