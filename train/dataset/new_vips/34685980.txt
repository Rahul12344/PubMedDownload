Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) plants are exposed to existing and emerging viruses as
a result of expanding acreage of blueberry plantations across the world,
primarily in North America. Since blueberry is cultivated in areas where there
are wild Vaccinium spp., there is increasing risk of virus movement between wild 
and cultivated blueberries. This is theoretically possible because viruses can
spread from commercial cultivars to native species and vice versa causing the
spread of existing and new viruses. The occurrence of these viruses in blueberry 
can be devastating to the industry considering the cost for cultivation and
production of this perennial crop. However, the advent of high-throughput
sequencing and bioinformatic sequence analysis have allowed for rapid
identification of known and novel viruses in any crop including blueberry, thus
facilitating proper intervention in response to serious viral diseases. In this
paper, we aim to focus on the current status of known and novel viruses emerging 
in blueberry worldwide, which may impact the blueberry industry.
