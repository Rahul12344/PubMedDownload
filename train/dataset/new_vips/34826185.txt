Extensive crosstalk exists between autophagy and innate immune signaling
pathways. The stimuli that induce pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated
innate immune signaling pathways, also upregulate autophagy. The purpose of this 
increased autophagy is to eliminate the stimuli and/or suppress the inflammatory 
pathways by targeted degradation of PRRs or intermediary proteins (termed
"inflammophagy"). By executing these functions, autophagy dampens excess
inflammation triggered by the innate immune signaling pathways. Thus, autophagy
helps in the maintenance of the body's innate immune homeostasis to protect from 
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Many autophagy-dependent mechanisms that
could control innate immune signaling have been studied over the last few years. 
However, still, the understanding is incomplete, and studies that are more
systematic should be undertaken to delineate the mechanisms of inflammophagy.
Here, we discuss the available knowledge of crosstalk between autophagy and PRR
signaling pathways.
