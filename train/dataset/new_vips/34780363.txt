INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed investigate the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 
viral load cycle threshold (Ct) values with pneumonia.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 158 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in upper
respiratory tract (URT) samples with molecular method and who had computed
tomography (CT) of the chest, between April 2020 and June 2020 were included in
this retrospective cross-sectional study.
RESULTS: Mean age of 158 PCR positive patients was 45.22 ± 17.89 and 60.8% of
them were male. Pneumonia was detected in 40.5% of the patients on their chest
CT. A weak but significant correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2 Ct value
detected with PCR in analysis of oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) samples
and chest CT score (Pearson's r: 0.197, p = 0.01). No correlation was found
between the first detected viral load Ct value and age, gender and mortality.
There was no significant correlation between chest CT score and mortality. While 
the areas remaining under ROC curve for Ct value in analysis of OP/NP samples in 
prediction of chest CT score ≥ 1, ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 were 0.564, 0.640 and 0.703
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 viral load (inverse
relationship with Ct) detected in OP/NP samples of patients with COVID-19
pneumonia did not reflect the increasing severity of pulmonary lesions on chest
CT. Although primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is all epithelial cells of the
respiratory tract we believe studies comparing viral loads in lower respiratory
tract samples are needed to determine the severity of pulmonary disease.
