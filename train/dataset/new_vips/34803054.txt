Pre-existing Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Infections and Mortality in New
York City.

De PK, Price T.

Objectives . We investigated the association of pre-existing economic variables
with COVID-19 infections and mortality in New York City. Methods . We combined
ZIP code-level data from New York City's Department of Health with five-year
American Community Survey data. We estimated ordinary least squares models of the
prevalence of positive COVID-19 test results and deaths per 100,000 population.
Results . We found ZIP codes with higher concentrations of residents living in
crowded living quarters, employees in high-risk occupations, and employees
commuting more than half an hour were positively and significantly associated
with higher infection rates. Higher rates of crowded housing were also
significantly and positively related to mortality rates, though the positive
point estimates for the other two economic variables were not statistically
significant. Conclusions . Economic factors such as working and living conditions
beyond common measures such as poverty generate significant public health
effects. Policymakers should consider these associations while designing and
modifying public health policies.
