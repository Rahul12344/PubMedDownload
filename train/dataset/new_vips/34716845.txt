The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of
concern (VOCs) that have become dominant as the pandemic progresses bear the ORF8
mutation together with multiple spike mutations. A 382-nucleotide deletion (Δ382)
in the ORF7b and ORF8 regions has been associated with milder disease phenotype
and less systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients. However, its impact on host 
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 remains undefined. Here, RNA-sequencing was performed
to elucidate whole blood transcriptomic profiles and identify contrasting immune 
signatures between patients infected with either wildtype or Δ382 SARS-CoV-2
variant. Interestingly, the immune landscape of Δ382 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
featured an increased adaptive immune response, evidenced by enrichment of genes 
related to T cell functionality, a more robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
immunity, as well as a more rapid antibody response. At the molecular level,
eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling was found to be upregulated in patients 
bearing Δ382, and its associated genes were correlated with systemic levels of T 
cell-associated and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study provides more in-depth
insight into the host-pathogen interactions of ORF8 with great promise as a
therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
