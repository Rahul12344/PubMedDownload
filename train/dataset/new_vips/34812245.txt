Objective: This study aimed to explore the characteristics of hemodialysis
patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Method: This descriptive study employed a cross-sectional approach using 30
participants purposively selected from two hemodialysis centers in Riau Province,
Indonesia. A personal information form and observation sheets were used for data 
collection. This study was conducted in May and June 2020. Distribution frequency
and Pearson Correlation tests were applied during analysis.
Results: A total of 16 (53.3%) patients were female, and most respondents (90%)
were married. In addition, the predominant occupation was employees (40%), and
the majority has graduated from Senior High School (43.3%). The Mean, Median, and
Standard Deviation (SD) of age were 49.9, 50.5, and 11.24. These parameters were 
respectively 37.88, 29.5, and 34.06 months for the duration from the first
dialysis, while 2.04, 2, and 0.24 were correspondingly reported in terms of
dialysis adequacy. The Mean, Median, and SD of Inter-dialytic weight gain were
2.25, 2.61, and 0.65, respectively. A correlation was established between age and
IDWG (p value = 0.047) with r score = -0.50, and also between IDWD and dialysis
adequacy (p value = 0.014) at r score = -0.60.
Conclusion: The study identified the need for nurses to carefully consider IDWG
and dialysis adequacy while caring for hemodialysis patients. This approach is
expected to facilitating survival during the COVID-19 pandemic.
