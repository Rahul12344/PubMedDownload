INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing people's psychological
health, especially in pregnant women. We aimed to examine associated factors of
fear of COVID-19, anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the pandemic
where the impacts of healthy eating behaviour (HES) and health literacy (HL) were
emphasized.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 14 February 2020 and 31
May 2020 in 18 health centres and hospitals across Vietnam. Data of 518 pregnant 
women were analysed, including socio-demographics, pregnant-related factors, HES,
HL, health-related behaviours, fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S), anxiety (using 
the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7)) and depression (using the patient
health questionnaire with 9 items (PHQ-9)). Regression analysis was utilized to
explore the associations.
RESULTS: Pregnant women with higher scores of HES and HL had lower likelihood of 
anxiety (odds ratio, OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.73, 0.87;
p < .001; and OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.90, 0.99; p = .018) and depression (OR, 0.84;
95%CI, 0.78, 0.91; p < .001; and OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91, 0.99; p = .044),
respectively. Pregnant women being employed had a lower FCoV-19S score
(regression coefficient, B, -1.46; 95%CI, -2.51, -0.40; p = .007). Besides, other
significant predictors of anxiety were eating healthier during the pandemic,
unchanged or more physical activity, elevated gestational age and smoking. Other 
significant predictors of depression were eating healthier during the pandemic,
elevated gestational age and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Among others, HES and HL had positive impacts on protecting pregnant
women against anxiety and depression. Improving HES and HL should be addressed as
a strategic approach to improve reproductive health during the pandemic.KEY
MESSAGEThe COVID-19 pandemic influences antenatal mental disorders with the
higher level as opposed to that before the pandemic.Healthy eating behaviour and 
better health literacy (HL) had critical roles in lowering prenatal anxiety and
depression during the COVID-19 crisis.Strategic approaches for improving healthy 
eating and HL should be recommended for protecting pregnant women from mental
health problems during the pandemic.
