Our previous efforts have proved that modifications targeting the 150-cavity of
influenza neuraminidase can achieve more potent and more selective inhibitors. In
this work, four subseries of C5-NH2 modified oseltamivir derivatives were
designed and synthesized to explore every region inside the 150-cavity. Among
them, compound 23d was exceptionally potent against the whole panel of Group-1
NAs with IC50 values ranging from 0.26 to 0.73 nM, being 15-53 times better than 
oseltamivir carboxylate (OSC) and 7-11 times better than zanamivir. In cellular
assays, 23d showed more potent or equipotent antiviral activities against
corresponding virus strains compared to OSC with no cytotoxicity. Furthermore,
23d exhibited high metabolic stability in human liver microsomes (HLM) and low
inhibitory effect on main cytochrome P450 enzymes. Notably, 23d displayed
favorable druggability in vivo and potent antiviral efficacy in the embryonated
egg model and mice model. Overall, 23d appears to be a promising candidate for
the treatment of influenza virus infection.
