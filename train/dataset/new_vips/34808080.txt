COVID-19-Associated Delays in Seeking Care, Madagascar.

During the coronavirus disease pandemic, we observed a 6.4-fold increase in
typhoid intestinal perforation incidence in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Thirteen
perforations occurred within 6 months (February 2020-July 2020), compared with 13
perforations during the previous 41 months (August 2016-January 2020). The
increase may be attributable to delayed healthcare seeking during the pandemic.
