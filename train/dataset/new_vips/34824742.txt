After the emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV)
subtypes H5N6 in 2013 and H5N8 in 2014, a surveillance study using molecular
epidemiology approaches was carried out during 2014 - 2019 in Iran to discover
any potential introduction or outbreak of HPAIV in wild bird populations. All
sick and dead wild birds found in nature, or in cases of an outbreak, a
collection of representative samples was tested using the specific molecular
methods for HPAIV H5 subtypes. Additionally, wild bird species in wetlands,
several zoos, zoological gardens, or rehabilitation centers were tested for
HPAIV. During the active surveillance plan, several individual and outbreak cases
of HPAIV and orthoavulaviruses were identified. In general, more than 900 fecal
materials, cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs, and/or tissue samples were collected 
from apparently healthy live birds representing several different species and
families. In addition, tissue and swab samples were collected and investigated
from any reported wild birds' mortality cases in different parts of Iran in the
framework of this study. No positive bird was found among apparently healthy live
birds; however, the highly pathogenic influenza viruses of H5N1, H5N2, H5N6, and 
H5N8 were found in individual dead birds or mass die-off cases.
