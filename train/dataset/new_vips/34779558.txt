High-salt diets have recently been implicated in hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, and autoimmune disease. However, whether and how dietary salt affects
host antiviral response remain elusive. Here, we report that high salt induces an
instant reduction in host antiviral immunity, although this effect is compromised
during a long-term high-salt diet. Further studies reveal that high salt
stimulates the acetylation at Lys663 of p97, which promotes the recruitment of
ubiquitinated proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation. p97-mediated
degradation of the deubiquitinase USP33 results in a deficiency of Viperin
protein expression during viral infection, which substantially attenuates host
antiviral ability. Importantly, switching to a low-salt diet during viral
infection significantly enhances Viperin expression and improves host antiviral
ability. These findings uncover dietary salt-induced regulation of ubiquitinated 
cellular proteins and host antiviral immunity, and could offer insight into the
daily consumption of salt-containing diets during virus epidemics.
