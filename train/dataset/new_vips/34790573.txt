Objective: To establish the sensitivity and specificity of a human papillomavirus
(HPV) and tumor marker DNA/mRNA assay for detecting cervical cancer that is
transferrable to a Lab-on-a-chip platform and determine its diagnostic benefit in
early stage disease when used in conjunction with high-resolution endovaginal
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: Forty-one patients (27 with Stage1 cervical cancer [Group1] and 14
non-cancer HPV negative controls [Group2]) had DNA and RNA extracted from
cervical cytology swab samples. HPV16, HPV18, hTERT, TERC/GAPDH and MYC/GAPDH
concentration was established using a loop mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) assay. Thresholds for tumor marker detection for Group1 were set from
Group2 analysis (any hTERT, TERC/GAPDH 3.12, MYC/GAPDH 0.155). Group 1
participants underwent endovaginal MRI. Sensitivity and specificity for cancer
detection by LAMP and MRI individually and combined was documented by comparison 
to pathology.
Results: Sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection was 68.8% and 77.8% if 
any tumor marker was positive regardless of HPV status (scenario1), and 93.8% and
55.8% if tumor marker or HPV were positive (scenario 2). Adding endovaginal MRI
improved specificity to 88.9% in scenario 1 (sensitivity 68.8%) and to 77.8%% in 
scenario2 (sensitivity 93.8%).
Conclusion: Specificity for cervical cancer detection using a LAMP assay is
superior with tumor markers; low sensitivity is improved by HPV detection.
Accuracy for early stage cervical cancer detection is optimal using a spatially
multiplexed tumor marker/HPV LAMP assay together with endovaginal MRI.
