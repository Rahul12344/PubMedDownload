BACKGROUND: Late 2019, a new highly contagious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged
in Wuhan, China, causing within 2 months a pandemic with the highest disease
burden in elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions. The pandemic
has highlighted that new and more flexible clinical trial approaches, such as
trial platforms, are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of interventions in
a timely manner. The two existing Swiss cohorts of immunocompromised patients
(i.e., Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS))
are an ideal foundation to set-up a trial platform in Switzerland leveraging
routinely collected data. Within a newly founded trial platform, we plan to
assess the efficacy of the first two mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that reached market
authorization in Switzerland in the frame of a pilot randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) while at the same time assessing the functionality of the trial platform.
METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled, open-label, 2-arm
sub-study pilot trial of a platform trial nested into two Swiss cohorts. Patients
included in the SHCS or the STCS will be eligible for randomization to either
receiving the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty® (Pfizer/BioNTech) or the COVID-19 mRNA
Vaccine Moderna®. The primary clinical outcome will be change in pan-lg antibody 
response (pan-Ig anti-S1-RBD; baseline vs. 3 months after first vaccination;
binary outcome, considering ≥ 0.8 units/ml as a positive antibody response). The 
pilot study will also enable us to assess endpoints related to trial conduct
feasibility (i.e., duration of RCT set-up; time of patient recruitment; patient
consent rate; proportion of missing data). Assuming vaccine reactivity of 90% in 
both vaccine groups, we power our trial, using a non-inferiority margin such that
a 95% two-sided confidence interval excludes a difference in favor of the
reference group of more than 10%. A sample size of 380 (190 in each treatment
arm) is required for a statistical power of 90% and a type I error of 0.025. The 
study is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (National Research
Program NRP 78, "COVID-19").
DISCUSSION: This study will provide crucial information about the efficacy and
safety of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in HIV patients and organ transplant
recipients. Furthermore, this project has the potential to pave the way for
further platform trials in Switzerland.
