BACKGROUND: Upper limb (UL) function is compromised in university students due to
prolonged academic activities and excessive use of electronic devices. However,
it is unknown whether this relationship was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
situation.
AIM: To determine the risk factors associated with reduced UL functionality in
university students in a pandemic situation due to COVID-19.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study that included 621 university students
from the northern, central and southern areas of Chile. Physical variables,
musculoskeletal, anthropometric and sociodemographic history were evaluated
through self-reported questionnaires.
RESULTS: The factors with the higher association with a lower UL functionality
were pain (Odds ratio (OR) = 17.6; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 5.2-60; p <
0.01) and injury (OR = 10.4; 95% CI = 3.9-28.3; p < .001). Also, a low weight (OR
= 10.5; 95% CI = 2.2-49.6; p < 0.01) and a quarantine lasting for five or more
weeks (OR = 9.1; 95% CI = 1,1-77.2; p = 0.043) were considered risk factors. The 
lower probability was observed in male participants (OR = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1-0.51;
p < 0.01) and in those with a moderate/high muscular condition (OR = 0.3; 95% CI 
= 0.1-0.9; p = 0.031.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of these modifiable risk factors can help to
implement preventive or rehabilitative actions at home or universities.
