PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the global literature regarding rashes
encountered in children and adults infected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and aims to provide practicing pediatricians 
with an understanding of the relationship between instances of rashes and
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children in order to effectively evaluate 
and treat patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: The true incidence of cutaneous reactions in children infected
with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Children's immune systems differ from those of
adults and rashes as a manifestation of immune responses, in turn, differ in
morphology and distribution. Rarely, children develop a severe multisystem
inflammatory syndrome that has overlapping clinical features with Kawasaki
disease. In addition, vaccinations produce rashes similar to natural infections. 
The rashes associated with COVID-19 vaccination are mild and transient, and
should not preclude vaccination. Lastly, children who chronically wear masks are 
more likely to experience flaring of acne around the nose and mouth ('maskne')
and facial conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis.
SUMMARY: There are ongoing worldwide registries, clinical and basic science
studies to better understand the burden of skin disease and pathophysiology of
rashes seen in patients infected with COVID-19. Robust vaccination programs
should be encouraged as a way to contain viral spread among children and the
greater population.
