Cells respond to viral infections through sensors that detect non-self-molecules,
and through effectors, which can have direct antiviral activities or adapt cell
physiology to limit viral infection and propagation. Eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2, better known as PKR, acts as both a sensor
and an effector in the response to viral infections. After sensing
double-stranded RNA molecules in infected cells, PKR self-activates and majorly
exerts its antiviral function by blocking the translation machinery and inducing 
apoptosis. The antiviral potency of PKR is emphasized by the number of strategies
developed by viruses to antagonize the PKR pathway. In this review, we present an
update on the diversity of such strategies, which range from preventing
double-stranded RNA recognition upstream from PKR activation, to activating eIF2B
downstream from PKR targets.
