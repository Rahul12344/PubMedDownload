The emergence of COVID-19 in the United States has overwhelmed local hospitals,
produced shortages in critical protective supplies for medical staff, and created
backlogs in burials and cremations. Because systemic disruptions occur most
acutely at a local scale, facilitating resource coordination across a broad
region can assist local responses to COVID-19 surges. This article describes a
structured systems approach for coordinating COVID-19 resource distribution
across the six New England states of the United States. The framework combines
modeling tools to anticipate resource shortages in medical supplies, personnel
needs, and fatality management for individual states. The approach allows
decision makers to understand the magnitude of local outbreaks and equitably
allocate resources within a region based on the present and future needs. This
model contributed to determining material distribution in New England as the 2020
COVID-19 surges unfolded in the spring and fall seasons. Using a systems
analysis, the model demonstrates the translation of anticipated COVID-19 cases
into resource demands to enable regional coordination of scarce resources.
