The incidence of lymphomas is increased in people living with HIV (PLWH).
Aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are the most common and are
considered an AIDS-defining cancer (ADC). Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is not
considered an ADC, its incidence is also increased in PLWH. Among all HIV-related
lymphomas (HRL), the prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is high. It has been 
shown that EBV is involved in different lymphomagenic mechanisms mediated by some
of its proteins, contributing to the development of different lymphoma subtypes. 
Additionally, cooperation between both HIV and EBV can lead to the proliferation 
of aberrant B-cells, thereby being an additional lymphomagenic mechanism in
EBV-associated HRL. Despite the close relationship between EBV and HRL, the
impact of EBV on clinical aspects has not been extensively studied. These
lymphomas are treated with the same therapeutic regimens as the general
population in combination with cART. Nevertheless, new therapeutic strategies
targeting EBV are promising for these lymphomas. In this article, the different
types of HRL are extensively reviewed, focusing on the influence of EBV on the
epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and pathological
characteristics of each lymphoma subtype. Moreover, novel therapies targeting EBV
and future strategies to treat HRL harboring EBV are discussed.
