Although commonly associated with autophagosomes, LC3 can also be recruited to
membranes by covalent lipidation in a variety of non-canonical contexts. These
include responses to ionophores such as the M2 proton channel of influenza A
virus. We report a subtractive CRISPR screen that identifies factors required for
non-canonical LC3 lipidation. As well as the enzyme complexes directly
responsible for LC3 lipidation in all contexts, we show the RALGAP complex is
important for M2-induced, but not ionophore drug-induced, LC3 lipidation. In
contrast, ATG4D is responsible for LC3 recycling in M2-induced and basal LC3
lipidation. Identification of a vacuolar ATPase subunit in the screen suggests a 
common mechanism for non-canonical LC3 recruitment. Influenza-induced and
ionophore drug-induced LC3 lipidation lead to association of the vacuolar ATPase 
and ATG16L1 and can be antagonized by Salmonella SopF. LC3 recruitment to
erroneously neutral compartments may therefore represent a response to damage
caused by diverse invasive pathogens.
