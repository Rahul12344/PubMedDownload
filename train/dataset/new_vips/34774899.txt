BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for efficacious
virucidal products to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Several studies have
suggested that alcohol-based sanitizers and some disinfectants are effective.
While virucidal activity data of low-level disinfectants are lacking and some
conclusions are not clear yet.
METHODS: We evaluated the virucidal activity of 2 quaternary ammonium compounds
(QAC) disinfectants (MICRO-CHEM PLUS and FWD), W30 (an amphoteric surfactant),
and Medical EtOH against SARS-CoV-2. Suspension tests covering different
concentration and contact time were performed using the integrated cell
culture-qPCR method.
RESULTS: Each of disinfectants was effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2. MCP and 
FWD are highly effective within 15 seconds. W30 is also efficient within 2
minutes at concentration of 1%. Consistent with previous report, our results also
demonstrated that 38% ethanol was sufficient to completely inactivate virus,
which proved the method used in this study is feasible.
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION: QAC disinfectants, MCP and FWD, are highly effective 
for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, which making them practical for use in health
care setting and laboratories where prompt disinfection is important. The
low-level disinfectant based on amphoteric surfactant, W30, which may present in 
commonly available household hygiene agents is also able to inactivate
SARS-CoV-2.
