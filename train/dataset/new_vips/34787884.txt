Cytokines in cardiac tissue plays a key role in progression of cardiometabolic
diseases and cardiotoxicity induced by several anticancer drugs. Interleukin-1β
is one on the most studied regulator of cancer progression, survival and
resistance to anticancer treatments. Recent findings indicate that interleukin1-β
exacerbates myocardial damages in cancer patients treated with chemotherapies and
immune check-point inhibitors. Interleukin1-β blocking agent canakinumab reduces 
major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death in recent
cardiovascular trials. We focalized on the main biological functions of
interleukin1-β in cancer and cardiovascular diseases, summarizing the main
clinical evidence available to date in literature. Especially in the era of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated to coagulopathies, myocarditis and heart
failure, cancer patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications
compared to general population, therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of
interleukin1-β should be discussed and considered.
