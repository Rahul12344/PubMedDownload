Social distancing measures have been a key component in government strategies to 
mitigate COVID-19 globally. Based on official documents, this study aimed to
identify, compare and analyse public social distancing policy measures adopted in
Denmark and Sweden regarding the coronavirus from 1 March 2020 until 1 October
2020. A key difference was the greater emphasis on laws and executive orders
(sticks) in Denmark, which allowed the country to adopt many stricter policy
measures than Sweden, which relied mostly on general guidelines and
recommendations (sermons). The main policy adopters in Denmark were the
government and the Danish Parliament, whereas the Public Health Agency issued
most policies in Sweden, reflecting a difference in political governance and
administrative structure in the two countries. During the study period, Sweden
had noticeably higher rates of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100,000
population than Denmark, yet it is difficult to determine the impact or relative 
effectiveness of sermons and sticks, particularly with regard to broader and
longer-term health, economic and societal effects.
