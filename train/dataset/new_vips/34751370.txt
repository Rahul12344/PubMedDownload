BACKGROUND: The European Union has been criticized for responding to the COVID-19
pandemic in a reactive, rather than prosilient manner. For the EU bloc to be
prosilient, it needs to have the right early warning indicators to allow
short-term healthcare system preparedness and agile planning of the public health
response.
METHOD: The association of COVID-19 disease burden, as measured by mortality
(COVID-19 and all-cause), hospital and ICU occupancy, with incidence rate (IR),
total positivity rate (TPR) and adjusted TPR as proposed by Vong and Kakkar, was 
investigated using Poisson regression analysis. This was carried out using both
real-time data and time lags of up to 8 weeks to identify potential for early
warning of spikes in disease burden. ECDC weekly figures for these indicators
were used, and the analysis was repeated for the subset of data after Week 42  of
2020, when the EU Council introduced minimum COVID-19 testing rates.
RESULTS: TPR and IR were noted to be the most predictive of COVID-19 disease
burden whilst adjusted TPR applied on weekly data was not associated. TPR behaved
better at predicting all-cause mortality in both analyses. The TPR and IR were
both best associated with hospital and ICU occupancy and COVID-19 mortality with 
a short time lag (2-3 weeks in the case of TPR with hospital occupancy and
COVID-19 mortality).
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring TPR can provide a 2-3-week warning of a spike in hospital
occupancy and COVID-19 mortality. This time, if well utilized, could help health 
systems save countless lives by mobilising resources.
