Interferons play a critical role in regulating host immune responses to
SARS-CoV-2, but the interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors that inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized. The IFN-inducible short isoform of human
nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) inhibits endocytic virus entry, interacts 
with the vacuolar ATPase, and promotes endo-lysosomal vesicle acidification and
lysosomal protease activity. Here, we used ectopic expression and gene knockout
to demonstrate that NCOA7 inhibits infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as by
lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike in lung epithelial cells. 
Infection with the highly pathogenic, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, or seasonal,
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, coronavirus Spike-pseudotyped viruses was also inhibited
by NCOA7. Importantly, either overexpression of TMPRSS2, which promotes plasma
membrane fusion versus endosomal fusion of SARS-CoV-2, or removal of Spike's
polybasic furin cleavage site rendered SARS-CoV-2 less sensitive to NCOA7
restriction. Collectively, our data indicate that furin cleavage sensitizes
SARS-CoV-2 Spike to the antiviral consequences of endosomal acidification by
NCOA7, and suggest that the acquisition of furin cleavage may have favoured the
co-option of cell surface TMPRSS proteases as a strategy to evade the suppressive
effects of IFN-induced endo-lysosomal dysregulation on virus infection.
