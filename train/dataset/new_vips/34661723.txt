PURPOSE: We investigated schoolteachers' emotional reactions to COVID-19 and
mental health during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further analyzed
if teachers, who belonged to a COVID-19 risk group, had more emotional reactions 
and poorer mental health than "non-risk" groups.
METHODS: We collected questionnaire data in May, June, and November-December 2020
and used data from 2665 teachers at public schools (871 individuals participated 
in all three surveys). Participants reported their fear of infection, fear of
transmission of infection to their home or pupils, perceived burnout and stress, 
and worries about their ability to manage the working conditions. We included
information about COVID-19 risk group status, gender, age, organization of
teaching (physical presence or remote teaching), and the pupils' grade. We
estimated prevalence ratios and took repeated measures into account.
RESULTS: Emotional reactions and poor mental health increased significantly with 
27-84% from May to November-December 2020. Teachers, who were particularly
vulnerable to the adverse consequences of COVID-19, had the highest prevalence of
fear of infection and poor mental health.
CONCLUSION: Teachers play a crucial role in a society's response to a pandemic.
Yet, the dual role of teaching and virus control along with concerns regarding
the health consequences of an infection may contribute to the observed increase
in emotional reactions to COVID-19 and poor mental health.
