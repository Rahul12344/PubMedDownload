Objectives: HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)
is a neuroinflammatory disorder associated with HTLV-1. Cytokines and
inflammatory mediators have a major role in forming inflammation in HAM/TSP
patients. This study aimed to measure the levels of IL-32, a proinflammatory
cytokine associated with autoinflammatory disorders, and also cyclooxygenase -2
(COX-2) as a key mediator of inflammatory pathways in HAM/TSP patients and HTLV-1
asymptomatic carriers (ACs).
Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
HAM/TSP patients, ACs, and healthy controls (HCs), and DNA and RNA were extracted
to evaluate HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and expression of IL-32 and COX-2, using
real-time PCR. Serum levels of IL-32 were determined by using an ELISA assay.
Results: The expression level of IL-32 was significantly higher in ACs compared
with HAM/TSP patients and HCs (P<0.0001 and P>0.05, respectively). There were no 
statistically significant differences in the expression levels of Cox-2 and
protein levels of IL-32 between the study groups. HTLV-1 PVL was higher in
HAM/TSP patients compared with ACs.
Conclusion: Results showed increased mRNA levels of IL-32 in ACs. Since HTLV-1
PVL in ACs is lower than in HAM/TSP patients, it could be concluded that IL-32
might be an HTLV-1 inhibitor that seems to control virus replication. Despite the
difference in IL-32 mRNA levels between study groups, no statistically
significant differences were observed in IL-32 serum levels. Also, there were no 
significant differences in COX-2 expression.
