We present the case of an acute onset ANCA positive vasculitis in an asymptomatic
COVID-19 infected teenager, resulting in significant colonic damage. The patient 
was initially diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein purpura and presented with
worsening symptoms with significant necrosis of her perineum and rectum requiring
surgical debridement and diverting colostomy. As a part of her work-up, she
tested positive for COVID-19 total IgG/IgM antibodies and ANCA antibodies. This
case complements previously reported cases of COVID-19 induced autoimmune disease
in children but is novel in describing extensive intestinal disease as a result
of an autoimmune vasculitis in a child.
