Despite the protracted battle against coronavirus acute respiratory infection
(COVID-19) and the rapid evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), no specific and effective drugs have to date been
reported. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a zinc metalloproteinase and 
a critical modulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has
anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis functions. ACE has become widely known in the 
past decade as it has been identified as the primary receptor for SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, being closely associated with their infection. SARS-CoV-2 primarily
targets the lung, which induces a cytokine storm by infecting alveolar cells,
resulting in tissue damage and eventually severe acute respiratory syndrome. In
the lung, innate immunity acts as a critical line of defense against pathogens,
including SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to summarize the regulation of ACE2, and
lung host cells resist SARS-CoV-2 invasion by activating innate immunity
response. Finally, we discuss ACE2 as a therapeutic target, providing reference
and enlightenment for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.
