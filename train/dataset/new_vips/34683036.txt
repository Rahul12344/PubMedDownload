The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has forced far-reaching changes in higher
education. Isolation from peers and distance learning have significantly limited 
interpersonal contacts, which might have affected the mental well-being of
students. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of
depressive symptoms and the level of perceived stress during e-learning among
Slovak students and to identify the variables that have the most significant
impact on mental health among students. The study included 3051 participants,
1773 women (58%) and 1278 (42%) with a mean age of 22.37 years. The Perceived
Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were used to measure
the severity of stress and depression level. In addition, an author's survey was 
used assessing the areas of social life, education skills, economic field,
nutrition habits, and drugs. Almost all study participants were characterized by 
increased stress level and 47% of them were depressed. Moreover, isolation
affected women more, especially in terms of social life and economics. It seems
necessary to implement appropriate support programs for students, which could
have the potential to improve their psychological condition.
