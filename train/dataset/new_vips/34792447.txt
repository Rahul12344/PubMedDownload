The COVID-19 outbreak offered a unique opportunity to capture the experiences of 
front-line practitioners during substantial and rapid changes to their daily
work, including workplace policy, protocols, environment and culture, as well as 
changes to their overall professional role in the healthcare system. Our team of 
paramedic researchers collected data throughout the first wave of the COVID-19
outbreak, exploring the lived experiences from a paramedic viewpoint. This
article will discuss impactful approaches to leadership in paramedicine -
differentiating between successful and failed strategies to leading and
supporting teams amid rapid change on the front lines of the fight against
COVID-19.
