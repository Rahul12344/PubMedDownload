BACKGROUND AND AIM: After the first cases of COVID-19 detected in Wuhan (China), 
the virus rapidly spread in the world, so much so that on February 20 the first
autochthonous case was officially identified in Italy. However, this person had
no apparent history of travel abroad or contact with people tested positive for
the virus. For this reason, the aim of this literature review was to reconstruct 
the epidemiological dynamics of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
Lombardy Region.
METHODS: To this end, a systematic review was carried out on PubMed/MEDLINE and
EMBASE, and on grey literature. All article assessing incidence, mortality and
hospitalizations by Lombardy province and municipality, and the impact of the
main containment and organizational measures were considered eligible. In
addition, data on general mortality and mortality due to COVID-19, hospital
admission, and serological and environmental were also retrieved.
RESULTS: From the included studies, it emerged that Lombardy was the first
European region in which the virus began to circulate as early as January 2020
(and probably even earlier). Despite the high number of cases and deaths
recorded, the reproduction number observed in Lombardy Region was, at the
beginning of March 2020, the same (or lower) than in other regions.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of the first epidemic wave in Lombardy, compared
to other Italian and foreign regions, highlight the extreme criticality of having
had the first autochthonous case (and the first substantial outbreaks) when
knowledge was still scarce and individual prevention measures were not
widespread.
