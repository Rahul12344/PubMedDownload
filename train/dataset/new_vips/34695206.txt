The potential introduction of African swine fever virus (ASFV) into the United
States has researchers evaluating routes of potential transmission and the
establishment of sylvatic cycles. To help document vector-host associations
related to ASFV transmission, the finding of O. turicata on a feral hog in Real
County, Texas is reported.
