Background: The novel SARS-CoV-2 has caused the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, with insufficient worldwide vaccination rates,
identifying treatment solutions to reduce the impact of the virus is urgently
needed.
Method: An adaptive, multicentric, open-label, and randomized controlled phase
I/II clinical trial entitled the "SENTAD-COVID Study" was conducted by the Abu
Dhabi Stem Cells Center under exceptional conditional approval by the Emirates
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for COVID-19 Research Committee from April 4th
to July 31st, 2020, using an autologous peripheral blood non-hematopoietic
enriched stem cell cocktail (PB-NHESC-C) administered by compressor (jet)
nebulization as a complement to standard care therapy. The primary endpoints
include safety and efficacy assessments, adverse events, the mortality rate
within 28 days, and the time to clinical improvement as measured by a 2-point
reduction on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital
whichever occurred first.
Results: The study included a total of 139 randomized COVID-19 patients, with 69 
in the experimental group and 70 in the control group (standard care). Overall
survival was 94.20% for the cocktail-treated group vs. 90.27% for the control
group. Adverse events were reported in 50 (72.46%) patients receiving PB-NHESC-C 
and 51 (72.85%) in the control group (p = 0.9590), with signs and symptoms
commonly found in COVID-19. After the first 9 days of the intervention, 67.3% of 
cocktail-treated patients recovered and were released from hospitals compared to 
53.1% (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.56-1.28) in the control group. Improvement, i.e., at 
least a 2-point reduction in the severity scale, was more frequently observed in 
cocktail-treated patients (42.0%) than in controls (17.0%) (RR = 0.69; 95% CI,
0.56-0.88).
Conclusions: Cocktail treatment improved clinical outcomes without increasing
adverse events. Thus, the nebulization of PB-NHESC-C was safe and effective for
treatment in most of these patients.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT04473170. It was retrospectively
registered on July 16th, 2020.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interestsThe procedure for obtaining
the PB-NHESC-C mentioned in this report was advanced through research conducted
and patented for ADSCC by YVC, AABH, and FMA. We declare that YMCA, CAVV, PS,
YMA, AA, LAH, GMTZ, and RARJ are also staff members of ADSCC. For the rest
thereof the co-authors, there are no competing interests. In May 2020, the
patented procedure was approved by the Ministry of Economy of the United Arab
Emirates, and also in May 2020, 5 of the authors (FMA, YVC, RARJ, AABH, and YMCA)
received 3 Copyrights from the INTEROCO Copyright Office (EC-01-002809,
EC-01-002810, and EC-01-002811), so this procedure including nebulization has
been accredited to ADSCC. Nevertheless, YVC and the other patent authors resigned
to be eligible to receive equity due to the licensing of this procedure.
