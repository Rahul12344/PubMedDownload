PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review paper evaluates the use of patient reported
outcome (PROs) in systemic vasculitis and the increasing incorporation of these
measures in the evaluation of clinical outcomes and healthcare provision.
RECENT FINDINGS: Generic PROs such as the SF-12, SF-36, EQ-5D have been used to
evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across the spectrum of
vasculitis; including giant cell arteritis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(ANCA)-related vasculitis and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgA) vasculitis. More 
recently disease-specific PROs have been developed including the associated
vasculitis (AAV)-PRO and GCA-PRO, whilst further work is ongoing including a
Steroid-PRO.
SUMMARY: Generic and disease-specific PROs are complimentary in nature, but the
advent of disease-specific PROs allows evaluation of the impact of specific
symptoms and intervention on patient HRQOL. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
advent of increasing virtual work has brought the potential for electronic-PRO
measures to the forefront and is a current area of interest.
