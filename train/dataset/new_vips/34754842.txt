Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have
posed a problematic healthcare situation worldwide since December 2019. Diabetes 
mellitus is associated with an increased risk and severity of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). While interacting with various other risk factors, high blood
sugar was found to reduce immunity and increase the replication of SARS-CoV-2.
Oxidative stress and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines are greater in
diabetic individuals than in healthy people, worsening the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 
infection in diabetics. Increased expression of furin and angiotensin converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor in the hyperglycemic environment may promote the entry 
of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell. COVID-19 infection primarily modulates immune and
inflammatory responses, and may cause a cytokine storm, resulting in possible
lethal outcomes in diabetics. An experimental report suggests that ACE expressed 
in the pancreas and the SARS-CoV-2 virus invariably destroy β-cells which contain
ACE-2 receptors and results in acute diabetes. Moreover, COVID-19 also causes
hyperglycemia in an individual with diabetes which may be related to insulin
resistance and destruction of β-cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early
observations also suggest a correlation between oral hypoglycemic agents and the 
risk of COVID-19. This review focused on the possible cause and mechanism
involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in diabetics and the role of antidiabetic drugs 
in COVID-19.
