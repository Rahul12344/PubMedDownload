Autophagic machinery is involved in selective and non-selective recruitment as
well as degradation or exocytosis of cargoes, including pathogens. Dengue virus
(DENV) infectioninduces autophagy that enhances virus replication and vesicle
release to evade immune systemsurveillance. This study reveals that DENV2 induces
autophagy in lung and liver cancer cells andshowed that DENV2 capsid, envelope,
NS1, NS3, NS4B and host cell proinflammatory high mobilitygroup box 1 (HMGB1)
proteins associated with autophagosomes which were purified by
gradientcentrifugation. Capsid, NS1 and NS3 proteins showing high colocalization 
with LC3 protein in thecytoplasm of the infected cells were detected in the
purified double-membrane autophagosome byimmunogold labeling under transmission
electron microscopy. In DENV infected cells, the levels ofcapsid, envelope, NS1
and HMGB1 proteins are not significantly changed compared to the
dramaticaccumulation of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 proteins when autophagic
degradation was blocked bychloroquine, indicating that these proteins are not
regulated by autophagic degradation machinery.We further demonstrated that
purified autophagosomes were infectious when co-cultured withuninfected cells.
Notably, these infectious autophagosomes contain DENV2 proteins,
negativestrandand full-length genomic RNAs, but no viral particles. It is
possible that the infectivity ofthe autophagosome originates from the full-length
DENV RNA. Moreover, we reveal that DENV2promotes HMGB1 exocytosis partially
through secretory autophagy. In conclusion, we are the firstto report that
DENV2-induced double-membrane autophagosomes containing viral proteins
andfull-length RNAs are infectious and not undergoing autophagic degradation. Our
novel findingwarrants further validation of whether these intracellular vesicles 
undergo exocytosis to becomeinfectious autophagic vesicles.
