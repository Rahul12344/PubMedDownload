PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge to the medical
community because little is known about its clinical course, therapeutic options,
and laboratory monitoring tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and surveillance. This 
review focuses on immune biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral blood in a
clinical laboratory under routine conditions to monitor the innate immune system 
response in the acute phase, as well as the adaptive immune response established 
both after infection and vaccination.
METHODS: A PubMed search was performed covering January 2020 to June 2021 to
extract biomarkers suitable for monitoring the immune response and outcome of
COVID-19 as well as therapeutic interventions, including vaccination.
RESULTS: To monitor the innate immune response, cytokines such as IL-6 or acute
phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (PCT) can be
measured on autoanalyzers complemented by automated white blood cell differential
counts. The adaptive immune response can be followed by commercially available
enzyme-linked immune spot (ELISpot) assays to assess the specific activation of T
cells or by monitoring IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies in serum to follow B cell
activation. As antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, spike and nucleocapsid proteins 
are particularly suitable and allow differentiation between the immune response
after infection or vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine immune monitoring of COVID-19 is feasible in clinical
laboratories with commercially available instruments and reagents. Whether
biomarkers reflecting the response of the innate and adaptive immune system can
be used to make predictions and assist in individualizing therapeutic
interventions or vaccination strategies, these strategies need to be determined
in appropriate clinical trials. Promising preliminary data are already available 
based on single-center reports and completed or ongoing vaccination trials.
