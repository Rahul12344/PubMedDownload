The Sputnik V is a COVID- 19 vaccine developed by the Gamalia institute of
epidemiology and microbiology and released on August 11, 2020. We provided
independent evidence on side effects and immunogenicity following the
administration of the Sputnik V COVID-19 in Iran. In this observational study,
the healthcare workers who were vaccinated with the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine
within February and April 2021 were evaluated. Among a total of 13,435 vaccinated
healthcare workers, we received 3236 self-declaration reports of Sputnik V
associated adverse events with the mean age 39.32 ± 10.19 years old which 38.8%
were men and 61.2% were women. Totally 68.8% of females versus 66.2% of males
reported side effects after receiving the first dose and 31.2% of females versus 
33.8% of males reported side effects after the second dose of vaccine. The most
common side effect was a pain in the injection site (56.9%), fatigue (50.9%),
body pain (43.9%), headache (35.7%), fever (32.9%), joint pain (30.3%), chilling 
(29.8%) and drowsiness (20.3%). Side effects of the vaccine were significantly
more frequent in females and younger individuals. Among a total of 238
participants, more than 90% after the first and second dose of vaccine had a
detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody.
Although the overall rate of adverse effects was higher than the interim results 
from randomized controlled trials, our findings support the manufacturer's
reports about the high humoral immunogenicity of vaccine against COVID-19.
