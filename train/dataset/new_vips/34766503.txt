Guided by Global Natural Products Social molecular networking, two p-terphenyl
derivatives and one 4,5-diphenyl-2-pyrone analogue, peniterphenyls A-C (1-3),
together with five known p-terphenyl derivatives (4-8) and sulochrin (9), were
obtained from a deep-sea-derived Penicillium sp. SCSIO41030. Their structures
were elucidated using extensive NMR spectroscopic and HRESIMS data and by
comparing the information with literature data. Peniterphenyl B (2) represented
the first reported natural product possessing a 4,5-diphenyl-substituted 2-pyrone
derivative. The p-terphenyl derivatives displayed inhibitory activities against
HSV-1/2 with EC50 values ranging from 1.4 ± 0.6 to 9.3 ± 3.7 μM in Vero cells,
which showed that they possessed antiviral activities with low cytotoxicity,
superior to the current clinical drug acyclovir (EC50 3.6 ± 0.7 μM).
Peniterphenyl A (1) inhibited HSV-1/2 virus entry into cells and may block
HSV-1/2 infection through direct interaction with virus envelope glycoprotein D
to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion, and thus differs from the
nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir. Our study indicated peniterphenyl A (1)
could be a promising lead compound against HSV-1/2.
