Objective: The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and oral lichen planus
(OLP) is well known, but the association with periodontal disease has been
reported less often. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 
periodontal bacteria and OLP lesions before and after HCV elimination. Subjects
and Methods. The subjects were four OLP patients (mean age 72.5 years) with HCV
infection. Six types of periodontal bacteria (Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were
quantified in saliva, and changes in OLP were examined before and after
elimination of HCV by antiviral therapy. Biochemical blood tests also were
performed.
Results: The total number of periodontal bacteria, the numbers of P. gingivalis, 
T. forsythia, T. denticola, and F. nucleatum, and the risk of presenting with the
red-complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T.denticola), leading to
periodontal disease progression, decreased after HCV elimination. OLP disappeared
in three of the four patients and decreased in the other after sustained
virological responses (SVRs).
Conclusion: HCV elimination not only improved OLP lesions but also reduced the
number of periodontal pathogens and the amount of red-complex periodontal
pathogens.
