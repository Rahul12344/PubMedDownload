Objective: The avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 circulating in Indonesia 
has raised increasing concern about its impact on poultry and its public health
risks. In this study, the H9N2 virus from chicken poultry farms in Java was
isolated and characterized molecularly.
Materials and Methods: Thirty-three pooled samples of chicken brain, cloacal
swab, trachea, and oviduct were taken from multiple chickens infected with AIV in
five regions of Java, Indonesia. The samples were isolated from specific
pathogenic-free embryonated eggs that were 9 days old. Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to identify H9N2 viruses.
Results: This study was successful in detecting and characterizing 13 H9N2
isolates. The sequencing analysis of hemagglutinin genes revealed a 96.9%-98.8%
similarity to the H9N2 AIV isolated from Vietnam in 2014 (A/muscovy
duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014). According to the phylogenetic analysis, all recent
H9N2 viruses were members of the lineage Y280 and clade h9.4.2.5. Nine of the
H9N2 isolates studied showed PSKSSR↓GLF motifs at the cleavage site, while four
had PSKSSR↓GLF. Notably, all contemporary viruses have leucine (L) at position
216 in the receptor-binding region, indicating that the virus can interact with a
human-like receptor.
Conclusion: This study described the features of recent H9N2 viruses spreading in
Java's poultry industry. Additionally, H9N2 infection prevention and management
must be implemented to avoid the occurrence of virus mutations in the Indonesian 
poultry industry.
