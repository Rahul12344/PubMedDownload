Ineffective antibody-mediated responses are a key characteristic of chronic viral
infection. However, our understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms that drive this
dysregulation are unclear. Here, we identify that targeting the epigenetic
modifier BMI-1 in mice improves humoral responses to chronic lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus. BMI-1 was upregulated by germinal center B cells in
chronic viral infection, correlating with changes to the accessible chromatin
landscape, compared to acute infection. B cell-intrinsic deletion of Bmi1
accelerated viral clearance, reduced splenomegaly and restored splenic
architecture. Deletion of Bmi1 restored c-Myc expression in B cells, concomitant 
with improved quality of antibody and coupled with reduced antibody-secreting
cell numbers. Specifically, BMI-1-deficiency induced antibody with increased
neutralizing capacity and enhanced antibody-dependent effector function. Using a 
small molecule inhibitor to murine BMI-1, we could deplete antibody-secreting
cells and prohibit detrimental immune complex formation in vivo. This study
defines BMI-1 as a crucial immune modifier that controls antibody-mediated
responses in chronic infection.
