Widespread human SARS-CoV-2 infections combined with human-wildlife interactions 
create the potential for reverse zoonosis from humans to wildlife. We targeted
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for serosurveillance based on evidence
these deer have angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors with high affinity for 
SARS-CoV-2, are permissive to infection, exhibit sustained viral shedding, can
transmit to conspecifics, exhibit social behavior, and can be abundant near urban
centers. We evaluated 624 prepandemic and postpandemic serum samples from wild
deer from four US states for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Antibodies were detected in 152
samples (40%) from 2021 using a surrogate virus neutralization test. A subset of 
samples tested with a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization test showed high
concordance between tests. These data suggest white-tailed deer in the
populations assessed have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
