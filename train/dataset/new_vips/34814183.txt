The arctic fox variant of the rabies virus (RABV) is enzootic in the circumpolar 
north. Reports of abortive RABV exposures motivated a retrospective analysis of
sera from 41 arctic foxes captured at Karrak Lake in Nunavut, Canada, during
2011-2015. Estimated RABV antibody prevalence among foxes was 14% (95% confidence
interval, 7-28%).
