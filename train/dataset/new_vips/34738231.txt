BACKGROUND: Domestic pets can contract severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; however, it is unknown whether the UK
B.1.1.7 variant can more easily infect certain animal species or increase the
possibility of human-to-animal transmission.
METHODS: This is a descriptive case series reporting SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant
infections in a group of dogs and cats with suspected myocarditis.
RESULTS: The study describes the infection of domestic cats and dogs by the
B.1.1.7 variant. Two cats and one dog were positive to SARS-CoV-2 PCR on rectal
swab, and two cats and one dog were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 2-6 weeks
after they developed signs of cardiac disease. Many owners of these pets had
developed respiratory symptoms 3-6 weeks before their pets became ill and had
also tested positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, all these pets were referred
for acute onset of cardiac disease, including severe myocardial disorders of
suspected inflammatory origin but without primary respiratory signs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the ability for pets
to be infected by the B.1.1.7 variant and question its possible pathogenicity in 
these animals.
