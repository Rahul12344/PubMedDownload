Objective: To study the influencing factors of influenza-associated severe acute 
respiratory illness (SARI) in children younger than 5 years of old in Suzhou, and
to provide evidence to support the improvement of prevention and control
strategies for influenza in children. Methods: We conducted a prospective
influenza surveillance for hospitalized SARI and outpatient influenza-like
illness (ILI) at Children's Hospital of Soochow University from April 2011 to
March 2017. We compared the clinical and other characteristics of
influenza-positive patients with SARI to those with ILI to find the differences
and to identify influencing factors of influenza-associated SARI, using χ2 test
and unconditional logistic regression. Results: We found 786 cases of
influenza-associated ILI and 413 cases of influenza-associated SARI during the
study period. Cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, asthma or wheezing were
more common in influenza-associated SARI than in influenza-associated ILI
(P<0.01). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that the
influencing factors which significantly associated with increased risk of
influenza-associated SARI were as follows: younger age (<6 months OR=3.6, 6-23
months aOR=2.5), respiratory infection history within 3 months (aOR=4.5), chronic
lung disease history (OR=3.4), fever above 39.0 ℃ (39.0-39.9 ℃ aOR=2.4, ≥40.0 ℃
aOR=6.0), and the presence of A/H1N1 (aOR=2.3), A/H3N2 (aOR=1.9). Conclusion:
Children younger than 2 years old, with a history of chronic lung disease, a
history of respiratory infection within 3 months, or with a fever peak above 39.0
℃ should seek medical advice as soon as possible or receive annual influenza
vaccination to reduce the incidence of influenza-associated serious outcomes.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨江苏省苏州地区<5岁儿童流感相关严重急性呼吸道感染（SARI）的影响因素，为完善儿童流感防控策略提供证据支持。 方法：
基于2011年4月至2017年3月在苏州大学附属儿童医院持续开展的前瞻性流感监测的相关数据，χ2检验比较流感相关流感样疾病（ILI）和流感相关SARI之间的临床特
征，非条件logistic回归分析流感相关SARI的影响因素。 结果： 共收集流感相关ILI 786例，流感相关SARI
413例。咳嗽、流涕、气促、哮喘/喘息等临床症状在流感相关SARI中出现的比例显著高于流感相关ILI（P<0.01）。单因素和多因素logistic回归分析结果显
示，年龄<6月龄（OR=3.6）、6~23月龄（aOR=2.5）、3个月内呼吸道感染史（aOR=4.5）、慢性肺部疾病史（OR=3.4）、发热热峰39.0~39.
9 ℃（aOR=2.4）、≥40
℃（aOR=6.0）、甲型（H1N1）（aOR=2.3）和甲型（H3N2）（aOR=1.9）流感病毒感染是流感相关SARI的影响因素。 结论：
年龄<2岁、有慢性肺部疾病史、有3个月内呼吸系统感染史以及发热热峰≥39.0 ℃的儿童应尽早就医，或每年接种流感疫苗，以减少流感相关严重结局的发生。.
