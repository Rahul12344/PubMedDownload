Microalgae are possible sources of antiviral substances, e.g. against cyprinid
herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). Although this virus leads to high mortalities in
aquacultures, there is no treatment available yet. Hence, ethanolic extracts
produced with accelerated solvent extraction from six microalgal species
(Arthrospira platensis, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella kessleri,
Haematococcus pluvialis, Nostoc punctiforme and Scenedesmus obliquus) were
examined in this study. An inhibition of the in vitro replication of CyHV-3 could
be confirmed for all six species, with the greatest effect for the C. reinhardtii
and H. pluvialis crude extracts. At still non-cytotoxic concentrations, viral DNA
replication was reduced by over 3 orders of magnitude each compared to the
untreated replication controls, while the virus titers were even below the limit 
of detection (reduction of 4 orders of magnitude). When pre-incubating both cells
and virus with C. reinhardtii and H. pluvialis extracts before inoculation, the
reduction of viral DNA was even stronger (> 4 orders of magnitude) and no
infectious viral particles were detected. Thus, the results of this study
indicate that microalgae and cyanobacteria are a promising source of natural
bioactive substances against CyHV-3. However, further studies regarding the
isolation and identification of the active components of the extracts are needed.
