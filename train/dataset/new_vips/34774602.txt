Although currently available antivirals against certain herpesviruses are
effective, the development of resistance during long-term use has necessitated
the search for seed compounds that work against novel target molecules. In this
report, we identified a thiourea derivative compound, 147B3, that inhibits the
infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in fibroblasts and herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) in Vero cells at a 50% effective concentration of 0.5 μM and
1.9 μM, respectively. Characterization of the compound provided the following
clues regarding its mode of action. 1) Time-of-addition and block-release assays 
showed that 147B3 behaved similarly to ganciclovir. 2) 147B3 reduced the
expression of early and late but not immediate-early gene products and the
accumulation of viral genomic DNA in both HCMV-infected and HSV-1-infected cells.
3) 147B3 inhibited the HCMV IE2-dependent activation of viral early gene
promoters. 4) Four HSV-1 clones resistant to 147B3 were isolated and
next-generation sequencing analysis of their genome DNA revealed that all of them
had a mutation(s) in the infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) gene, which encodes a
viral transcriptional factor. 5) Although 147B3 did not reduce the amount of ICP4
in an immunoblotting analysis, it changed the localization of the ICP4 from the
speckles in the nuclei to diffused dots in the cytoplasm. 6) 147B3 did not affect
the localization of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. Our findings suggest
that 147B3 targets viral transactivators, potentially through their interaction
with factors required for the viral gene expression system.
