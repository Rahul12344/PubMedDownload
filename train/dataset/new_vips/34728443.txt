OBJECTIVE: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigma towards COVID-19 infection
has become a major component of public discourse and social phenomena. As such,
we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS).
DESIGN AND SETTING: National-based survey cross-sectional study during the
lockdown in Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement
tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of
COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and
Insomnia Severity Index.
METHODS: Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with
model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item
response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and
reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying
the proper cut-off scores.
RESULTS: After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created
the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: stereotype, prejudice 
and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and
experts' perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank,
95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived
risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social
Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. 
The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and
Insomnia Severity Index were <0.2, supporting the discriminant validity. The
reliability of the COVID-PSS was satisfactory, with good internal consistency
(Cronbach's α of 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and test-retest reproducibility
(intraclass correlation of 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The proposed cut-off
scores were as follows: no/minimal (≤18), moderate (19-25) and high (≥26) public 
stigma towards COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-PSS is practical and suitable for measuring stigma towards
COVID-19 in a public health survey. However, cross-cultural adaptation may be
needed.
