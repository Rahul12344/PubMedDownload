Vector-borne flaviviruses are responsible for nearly half a billion human
infections worldwide each year, resulting in millions of cases of debilitating
and severe diseases and approximately 115,000 deaths. While approved vaccines are
available for some of these viruses, the ongoing efficacy, safety and supply of
these vaccines are still a significant problem. New technologies that address
these issues and ideally allow for the safe and economical manufacture of
vaccines in resource-poor countries where flavivirus vaccines are in most demand 
are urgently required. Preferably a new vaccine platform would be broadly
applicable to all flavivirus diseases and provide new candidate vaccines for
those diseases not yet covered, as well as the flexibility to rapidly pivot to
respond to newly emerged flavivirus diseases. Here, we review studies conducted
on novel chimeric vaccines derived from insect-specific flaviviruses that provide
a potentially safe and simple system to produce highly effective vaccines against
a broad spectrum of flavivirus diseases.
