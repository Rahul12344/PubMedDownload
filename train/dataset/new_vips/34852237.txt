RNA viruses generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) that can interfere with
replication of the parental wild-type virus. To examine their therapeutic
potential, we created a DVG by deleting the capsid-coding region of poliovirus.
Strikingly, intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of this genome, which we
termed eTIP1, elicits an antiviral response, inhibits replication, and protects
mice from several RNA viruses, including enteroviruses, influenza, and
SARS-CoV-2. While eTIP1 replication following intranasal administration is
limited to the nasal cavity, its antiviral action extends non-cell-autonomously
to the lungs. eTIP1 broad-spectrum antiviral effects are mediated by both local
and distal type I interferon responses. Importantly, while a single eTIP1 dose
protects animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it also stimulates production of
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that afford long-lasting protection from
SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Thus, eTIP1 is a safe and effective broad-spectrum
antiviral generating short- and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other
respiratory infections in animal models.
