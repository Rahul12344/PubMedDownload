Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the possibility to monitor both
host and pathogens transcriptomes at the cellular level. Here, public scRNA-seq
datasets from Drosophila melanogaster midgut cells were used to compare the
differences in replication strategy and cellular responses between two fly
picorna-like viruses, Thika virus (TV) and D. melanogaster Nora virus (DMelNV).
TV exhibited lower levels of viral RNA accumulation but infected a higher number 
of cells compared to DMelNV. In both cases, viral RNA accumulation varied
according to cell subtype. The cellular heat shock response to TV and DMelNV
infection was cell-subtype- and virus-specific. Disruption of bottleneck genes at
later stages of infection in the systemic response, as well as of
translation-related genes in the cellular response to DMelNV in two cell
subtypes, may affect the virus replication.
