While a drug treatment is unavailable, the global incidence of Dengue virus
(DENV) infections and its associated severe manifestations continues to rise. We 
report the construction of the first physiologically based
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model that predicts viremia levels in
relevant target organs based on preclinical data with the broad spectrum
antiviral soraphen A (SorA), an inhibitor of the host cell target
acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. SorA was highly effective against DENV in vitro (EC50 =
4.7 nM) and showed in vivo efficacy by inducing a significant reduction of viral 
load in the spleen and liver of IFNAR-/- mice infected with DENV-2. PBPK/PD
predictions for SorA matched well with the experimental infection data. Transfer 
to a human PBPK/PD model for DENV to mimic a clinical scenario predicted a
reduction in viremia by more than one log10 unit for an intravenous infusion
regimen of SorA. The PBPK/PD model is applicable to any DENV drug lead and, thus,
represents a valuable tool to accelerate and facilitate DENV drug discovery and
development.
