BACKGROUND: Knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection is unfolding. Insights from patient features in different 
environments are therefore vital to understanding the disease and improving
outcomes.
AIM: This study aimed to describe patient characteristics associated with
symptomatic presentation and duration of hospitalisation in coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) patients managed in Abuja.
SETTING: The study was conducted in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory,
Nigeria.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 201 COVID-19 patients hospitalised in 
the Asokoro District Hospital COVID-19 Isolation and Treatment Centre between
April 2020 and July 2020. Demographic and clinical data were obtained and
outcomes assessed were symptom presentation and duration of hospitalisation.
RESULTS: Patients' median age was 39.3 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 26-52); 
65.7% were male and 33.8% were health workers. Up to 49.2% of the patients were
overweight or obese, 68.2% had mild COVID-19 at presentation and the most common 
symptoms were cough (38.3%) and fever (33.8%). Hypertension (22.9%) and diabetes 
mellitus (7.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The median duration of
hospitalisation was 14.4 days (IQR: 9.5-19). Individuals with secondary and
tertiary education had higher percentage symptoms presentation (8.5% and 34%,
respectively), whilst a history of daily alcohol intake increased the length of
hospital stay by 129.0%.
CONCLUSION: Higher educational levels were linked with symptom presentation in
COVID-19 patients and that daily alcohol intake was significantly associated with
longer hospital stay. These findings highlight the importance of public education
on COVID-19 for symptom recognition, early presentation and improved outcomes.
