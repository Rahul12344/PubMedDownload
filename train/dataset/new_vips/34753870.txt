BACKGROUND: Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) in people living with HIV
(PLWH) can lead to the undetectable levels of HIV reservoirs in blood, even using
highly sensitive assays. However, with antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption,
rebound of HIV viremia occurs. The source of this rebound viremia is of interest 
in HIV cure strategies.
METHODS: Within a trial of alloBMT in individuals with hematologic malignancies
and HIV (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01836068), one recipient self-interrupted ART
after achieving >99.5% host cell replacement in peripheral blood by day 147 and
developed severe acute retroviral syndrome with meningoencephalitis at 156 days
post-alloBMT. We isolated replication-competent HIV using a quantitative viral
outgrowth assay at -100 and -25 days pre-alloBMT and from the same time points
pre-alloBMT for HIV DNA and cell-associated RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and resting memory CD4+ T-cells. We isolated HIV RNA in plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at viral rebound. We sequenced the RT-region of pol and
performed neighbor-joining phylogenetic reconstruction.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed an identical viral sequence at both
pre-alloBMT time-points accounting for 9/34 sequences (26%) of the sampled HIV
reservoir. This sequence population grouped with viral rebound sequences from
plasma and CSF with high sequence homology.
DISCUSSION: Despite >99.5% replacement of host cells in peripheral blood, ART
interruption led to HIV viral rebound in plasma and CSF. Further, the rebound
virus matched replication competent virus from resting memory CD4+ T-cells
pre-alloBMT. This case underscores that HIV-infected recipient cells can persist 
after alloBMT, and that latent replication-competent virus can re-establish
infection.
