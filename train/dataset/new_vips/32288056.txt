Study of nervous system viral diseases is not limited to descriptions of the
topography of the infection in man : it also includes studies of animal models
which can help in the understanding of the physiopathology of the diseases.It is 
unlikely than all viruses which can infect nervous tissues are known, and new
human viruses have been discovered by Neurologists. Analysis of the route of
viral penetration into the brain, and of differing cell susceptibility can help
our understanding of disease.Pathological modalities, other than acute infection,
have been recently described.Slow virus infections can result from an atypical
relationship between the virus and the cell, or the infected cell and the
immunological response of the host, as well as from infection by a new category
of unconventional agents which nervertheless share some common properties with
known viruses.
