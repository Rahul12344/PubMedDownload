Delirious mania (the coexistence of delirium and mania) is described in the
literature but not recognised in standard nosologies. We report a woman in her
late 30s, with no psychiatric history, who presented with concurrent symptoms of 
mania and delirium. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia (positive reverse
transcription-PCR test). There was no history of substance misuse or concurrent
medical illness. CT head scan was normal as were blood investigations, other than
elevated inflammatory markers. She received standard treatment for COVID-19
pneumonia and lorazepam and quetiapine to treat her neuropsychiatric symptoms.
She made a full recovery after 9 days. She was apyrexial with normal oxygen
saturation throughout her illness. The case shows that severe neuropsychiatric
symptoms can complicate otherwise mild COVID-19 pneumonia with neuroinflammation 
being a possible mechanism. A diagnosis of delirious mania appears to better
capture the complexity of the presentation than a diagnosis of mania or delirium 
alone.
