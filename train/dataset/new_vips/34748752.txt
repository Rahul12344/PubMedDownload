OBJECTIVE: During the 2016-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, the prevention of
unintended pregnancies was identified as a primary strategy to prevent birth
defects. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of the Zika Contraception
Access Network (Z-CAN), an emergency response intervention that provided women in
Puerto Rico with access to the full range of reversible contraception at no cost 
and compared results with a pre-implementation hypothetical cost-effectiveness
analysis (CEA).
STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated costs and outcomes of Z-CAN from a health sector
perspective compared to no intervention using a decision tree model. Number of
people served, contraception methods mix, and costs under Z-CAN were from actual 
program data and other input parameters were from the literature. Health outcome 
measures included the number of Zika-associated microcephaly (ZAM) cases and
unintended pregnancies. The economic benefits of the Z-CAN intervention were
ZIKV-associated direct costs avoided, including lifetime medical and supportive
costs associated with ZAM cases, costs of monitoring ZIKV-exposed pregnancies and
infants born from Zika-virus infected mothers, and the costs of unintended
pregnancies prevented during the outbreak as a result of increased contraception 
use through the Z-CAN intervention.
RESULTS: The Z-CAN intervention cost a total of $26.1 million, including costs
for the full range of reversible contraceptive methods, contraception related
services, and programmatic activities. The program is estimated to have prevented
85% of cases of estimated ZAM cases and unintended pregnancies in the absence of 
Z-CAN. The intervention cost was projected to have been more than offset by $79.9
million in ZIKV-associated costs avoided, 96% of which were lifetime
ZAM-associated costs, as well as $137.0 million from avoided unintended
pregnancies, with total net savings in one year of $216.9 million. The results
were consistent with the previous CEA study.
CONCLUSION: Z-CAN was likely cost-saving in the context of a public health
emergency response setting.
