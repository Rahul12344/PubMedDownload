EEHV is a ubiquitous virus, which most likely has co-evolved with elephants and
is shed by healthy individuals and maintained in the herds. Yet, the factors
determining calf susceptibility to the virus remain unknown. Here, we explored
the impact of EEHV-HD in the European captive Asian elephant population in a
retrospective statistical study spanning the last 35 years. We show that EEHV-HD 
was implicated in more than half of all deaths recorded in calves older than one 
months old. Moreover, the median age across EEHV-HD fatalities was significantly 
lower compared to other death causes. Finally, we investigated if heredity and
zoo-associated factors could be linked to a higher susceptibility of calves to
this disease. We used a univariable logistic regression model to evaluate if
either fathers, mothers, or zoos could, separately, be considered as risk factors
to the development of the disease. Afterwards, we used a two multivariable model,
combining: (1) fathers and zoos, and (2) mothers and zoos. Overall, we found that
two fathers, one mother, and four zoos had three or more times higher risk of
their calves becoming sick when compared to all others, pointing us to the
presence of a management or environmental element, which can have paternal and
maternal influence and leads to calf susceptibility or resistance to EEHV-HD.
