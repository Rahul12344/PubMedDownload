Intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are non-rod/non-cone
retinal photoreceptors expressing the visual pigment, melanopsin, to detect
ambient irradiance for various non-image-forming visual functions. The
M1-subtype, amongst the best studied, mediates primarily circadian
photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex. Their intrinsic light responses are 
more prolonged than those of rods and cones even at the single-photon level, in
accordance with the typically slower time course of non-image-forming vision. The
short (OPN4S) and long (OPN4L) alternatively-spliced forms of melanopsin proteins
are both present in M1-ipRGCs, but their functional difference is unclear. We
have examined this point by genetically removing the Opn4 gene (Opn4-/-) in mouse
and re-expressing either OPN4S or OPN4L singly in Opn4-/- mice by using
adeno-associated virus, but found no obvious difference in their intrinsic
dim-flash responses. Previous studies have indicated that two dominant slow steps
in M1-ipRGC phototransduction dictate these cells' intrinsic dim-flash-response
kinetics, with time constants (τ1 and τ2) at room temperature of ~ 2 s and
~ 20 s, respectively. Here we found that melanopsin inactivation by
phosphorylation or by β-arrestins may not be one of these two steps, because
their genetic disruptions did not prolong the two time constants or affect the
response waveform. Disruption of GAP (GTPase-Activating-Protein) activity on the 
effector enzyme, PLCβ4, in M1-ipRGC phototransduction to slow down G-protein
deactivation also did not prolong the response decay, but caused its rising phase
to become slightly sigmoidal by giving rise to a third time constant, τ3, of
~ 2 s (room temperature). This last observation suggests that GAP-mediated
G-protein deactivation does partake in the flash-response termination, although
normally with a time constant too short to be visible in the response waveform.
