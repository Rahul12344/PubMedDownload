INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus has been reported as the etiological cause of 
most cervical cancers and other potentially malignant lesions. It also affects
other areas, producing benign tumors on the skin. Plantar warts are a common
problem found in clinical practice and share signs and symptoms with other
dermatological conditions. Diagnosis of HPV infection remains a hot topic in
research.
METHOD: The present work systematically reviews the literature on the diagnostic 
techniques available in the clinical setting for any type of lesion produced by
the virus and compares the techniques identified to those found in use for foot
lesions.
RESULTS: Results showed a variety of diagnostic methods, including molecular
techniques, which exhibit more sensitivity than other methods but are less
frequently applied to plantar lesions, where visual inspection is the most
frequent method but can lead to errors.
CONCLUSION: The techniques identified need to be applied to plantar lesions to
improve differential diagnosis in clinical practice.
EXPERT OPINION: Research will continue to grow and a proper diagnostic technique 
for plantar lesions will be available in the near future.
