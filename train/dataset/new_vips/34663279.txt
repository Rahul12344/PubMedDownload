BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to pandemic that affected
almost all countries in the world. Many countries have implemented border
restriction as a public health measure to limit local outbreak. However, there is
inadequate scientific data to support such a practice, especially in the presence
of an established local transmission of the disease.
OBJECTIVE: To apply a metapopulation Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered
(SEIR) model with inspected migration to investigate the effect of border
restriction as a public health measure to limit outbreak of coronavirus disease
2019.
METHODS: We apply a modified metapopulation SEIR model with inspected migration
with simulating population migration, and incorporating parameters such as
efficiency of custom inspection in blocking infected travelers in the model. The 
population sizes were retrieved from government reports, while the number of
COVID-19 patients were retrieved from Hong Kong Department of Health and China
Centre for Disease Control (CDC) data. The R0 was obtained from previous clinical
studies.
RESULTS: Complete border closure can help to reduce the cumulative COVID-19 case 
number and mortality in Hong Kong by 13.99% and 13.98% respectively. To prevent
full occupancy of isolation facilities in Hong Kong; effective public health
measures to reduce local R0 to below 1.6 was necessary, apart from having
complete border closure.
CONCLUSIONS: Early complete travel restriction is effective in reducing
cumulative cases and mortality. However, additional anti-COVID-19 measures to
reduce local R0 to below 1.6 are necessary to prevent COVID-19 cases from
overwhelming hospital isolation facilities.
