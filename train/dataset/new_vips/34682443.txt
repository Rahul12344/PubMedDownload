BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many changes in the functioning of
people all over the world in a short period of time. According to a WHO report
(2020), it is women who are at a particular risk of the negative effects of the
pandemic, especially in terms of mental health.
AIM OF STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety,
depression, irritability, and loneliness among adult women during the COVID-19
pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on a representative sample of
women in Poland (n = 452). The data were collected using the HADS-M scale and the
R-UCLA scale.
RESULTS: A low level of loneliness was found in 37.3% of the women, moderate in
38.9%, moderately high in 22.3% and very high in 1.3% of women. Self-rating of
physical and mental health was significantly positively correlated with anxiety, 
depression, and irritability in HADS-M, and loneliness in R-UCLA. As the severity
of loneliness increased, so did Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores on
all subscales (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study group presented with mental well-being disorders in the
form of anxiety and depression. Two in three women experienced loneliness.
