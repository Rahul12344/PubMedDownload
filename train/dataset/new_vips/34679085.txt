BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced Human
Immunodeficiency Virus related morbidity and mortality. It has also transformed
HIV infection into a manageable chronic condition. However, first-line
antiretroviral treatment failure continues to grow especially in resource limited
settings. Despite this, determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment
failure are not well studied in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment
failure among adult patients on antiretroviral therapy in Mettu Karl Specialized 
Hospital, South West Ethiopia, in 2020.
METHODS: A hospital based case-control study was conducted from October to
November 2020. Simple random sampling technique was used to select participants. 
Interviewer administered questionnaire and record review were used for data
collection. Data were entered into epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS
version 20 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression
analysis were used. At the end, variables with P-value < 0.05 at 95% confidence
intervals for adjusted odds ratio were considered statistically significant
determinants of first line treatment failure.
RESULT: A total of 113 cases and 339 controls were included in the study with
response rate of 98.6%. Sixty-four (56.6%) of cases and 183 (54.0%) of controls
were females. Baseline WHO clinical stage III and IV (AOR = 1.909, 95% CI:
(1.103, 3.305), baseline body mass index<18.5kg/m2(AOR = 2.208,95%
CI:(1.257,3.877),baseline CD4 cell count <100cells/mm3 (AOR = 3.016, 95% CI:
(1.734, 5.246), having history of TB co-infection (AOR = 1.855, 95% CI: (1.027,
3.353), having history of lost to follow up (AOR = 3.235, 95% CI: (1.096, 9.551),
poor adherence to medication (AOR = 7.597, 95% CI: (4.059, 14.219) and initiation
of treatment after two years of diagnosis with HIV (AOR = 4.979, 95% CI: (2.039, 
12.158) were determinants of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure.
CONCLUSION: In this study several variables were found to be determinants of
first-line antiretroviral treatment failure. Concerned bodies should give more
attention to early diagnosis of HIV, early enrollment in chronic HIV care and
early initiation of ART before patients develop advanced WHO clinical stages. In 
addition, focus has to be given for patients with low CD4 count. Regular
screening for TB, counseling on optimal adherence to medication and enhancing
nutritional status of patients with low body mass index are also crucial to
prevent first-line antiretroviral treatment failure.
