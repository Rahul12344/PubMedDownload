We detected the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) antigen in three boar-pig
hybrids (hybrids) and three pigs. All animals were experimentally infected with
CSFV strain JPN/27/2019 to optimize diagnostic sampling and risk assessment of
virus dissemination. Two hybrids died 17- and 19-days post-inoculation (dpi). The
other animals were euthanized at 28 dpi. The detection of CSFV antigen at 28 dpi 
in epithelial cells of the apocrine sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin,
salivary glands, mucosal epithelial cells in the rectum, and epithelial cells in 
the kidney and urinary bladder, suggests that CSFV persists in these tissues and 
spreads via sweat, saliva, feces, and urine for at least 4 weeks. These findings 
reveal that hybrids and pigs represent a high risk of virus dissemination four
weeks after infection with CSFV strain JPN/27/2019. Prominent CSFV antigens were 
also detected in hair follicles of the skin. These results suggest that
postmortem sampling of animal skin may be effective for CSF diagnosis and can be 
used to develop a rapid and easy diagnostic method using hair follicles.
