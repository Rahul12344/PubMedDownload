A comprehensive analysis and characterization of a severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection model that mimics non-severe and
severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans is warranted for
understating the virus and developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we
characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice,
controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in the epithelia, including
airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. We found
that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2×103 and 2×104 PFU) of
SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs,
including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2×101 and 2×102 PFU) led to
less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this
hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a
dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in post-mortem
samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered from infection
with a low dose of virus survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared
to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive
COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about
this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues
with comparison to human post-mortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In
conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe
COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can provide insight into disease
progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19.
Importance The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached nearly
240 million cases and caused nearly 5 million deaths worldwide as of October
2021, has raised an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and
therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that
recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is
greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse
model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the
mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis and survival
in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the
pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients 
to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of anti-viral 
drugs and therapeutics.
