In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic with no designated cure or vaccine, 
the only way to break the infection chain is self-isolation and maintaining the
physical distancing. In this article, we present a potential application of the
Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and physical distance monitoring for
pandemic situations. The proposed framework consists of three parts: a
lightweight and low-cost IoT node, a smartphone application (app), and fog-based 
Machine Learning (ML) tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks 
health parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate, and 
blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display the user
health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a physical distance of 2
m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling virus spread. In addition, a
Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog server) considers the environmental risk
and user health conditions to predict the risk of spreading infection in real
time. The environmental risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides
updated information for different places. Two scenarios are considered for the
communication between the IoT node and fog server, 4G/5G/WiFi, or LoRa, which can
be selected based on environmental constraints. The required energy usage and
bandwidth (BW) are compared for various event scenarios. The COVID-SAFE framework
can assist in minimizing the coronavirus exposure risk.
