This paper focuses on the remote mental health care program developed at DGSAM,
in Buenos Aires City during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is based on the concepts of
telemental health. The change carried out from a previous phone orientation
program towards a healthcare system with comprehensive health electronic records 
(HIS) and carried-out by mental health professionals, intersectorial articulation
and progressive mental health care networks are the most outstanding aspects of
the program. As well as the strengthening on health information systems and
training professionals in telemental health care. During the first six months of 
operation, 7.154 calls were attended, 95,62% were solved within the program
protocols and the remaining 4,38% were referred for georeferenced treatments and 
for re-linking with the respective health care teams. It was also useful in
solving psychiatric emergency situations.
