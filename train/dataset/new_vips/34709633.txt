Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 protein is a multifunctional protein involved in several 
pathogenic processes but also has been described as a protective antigen suitable
for eliciting humoral response against DENV. NS1 is essential for virus
replication and can be found in different cell compartments and at different
oligomeric states. It is secreted to the extracellular medium and can also be
found circulating in the blood of infected patients, being routinely used as the 
serum biomarker for early dengue diagnosis. High-yield production of the
recombinant NS1 protein in a native-like conformation is essential for studies
regarding its function during DENV infection as well as to those interested in
the development of new diagnostic approaches based on this protein. In this
chapter, we describe an optimized protocol for high-yield expression of
native-like NS1 in Escherichia coli bacterial cells.
