INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic had a big impact on the health services
organisation, including that of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
AIM: To analyse and evaluate the influence of COVID-19 epidemic on the detection 
of STIs and healthcare services in a group of these patients on the base of the
experience of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology and University
Outpatient Clinic in Bialystok, Poland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of the number of consultations for suspicion of
STIs, number of newly diagnosed cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, Chlamydia
trachomatis infections and genital herpes in two periods: January 2019 - February
2020 (before the epidemic state was introduced) and March 2020 - April 2021
(during pandemic). STIs cases hospitalised in the same periods were also
analysed.
RESULTS: The number of hospitalisations and outpatient consultations decreased
during pandemic as compared to the period before it (by 83.3% and 41.9%,
respectively). Patients with syphilis constituted the majority in both periods,
remaining STIs were few. During pandemic, the proportion of detected cases of
syphilis was higher as compared to the time before it, despite the diminished
number of consultations (39.4% and 28%, respectively). Majority of patients with 
syphilis were men (92.3% and 93.3%), among them men-who-have-sex-with-men
constituted at least 50%. Early syphilis was diagnosed more frequently during
pandemic than before it (92.3% and 78.6%, respectively), early symptomatic
syphilis in particular (46.2% and 35.7%, respectively). HIV coinfection in
syphilis patients was more frequent during pandemic (15.8% and 7.1%,
respectively). More than half of these patients (53.8%) did not come for
follow-up visits after treatment during pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic caused the decrease in number of outpatient STIs
consultations and hospitalisations. The proportion of newly diagnosed cases of
syphilis per number of consultations increased. The percentage of early syphilis 
cases, especially early symptomatic syphilis increased. Adherence to after
treatment follow up was suboptimal.
