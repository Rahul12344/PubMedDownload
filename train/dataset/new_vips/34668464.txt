New Zealand has a strategy of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 that has resulted in a low
incidence of reported coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). The aim of this study
was to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand via a nationwide
serosurvey of blood donors. Samples (n = 9806) were collected over a month-long
period (3 December 2020-6 January 2021) from donors aged 16-88 years. The sample 
population was geographically spread, covering 16 of 20 district health board
regions. A series of Spike-based immunoassays were utilised, and the serological 
testing algorithm was optimised for specificity given New Zealand is a low
prevalence setting. Eighteen samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,
six of which were retrospectively matched to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases.
A further four were from donors that travelled to settings with a high risk of
SARS-CoV-2 exposure, suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The
remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health
regions for a true seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for test sensitivity and
specificity, of 0.103% (95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.12%). The very low
seroprevalence is consistent with limited undetected community transmission and
provides robust, serological evidence to support New Zealand's successful
elimination strategy for COVID-19.
