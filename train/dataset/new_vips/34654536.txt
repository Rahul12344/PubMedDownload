BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: CGRP, a neuropeptide involved in migraine
pathophysiology, is also known to play a role in the respiratory system and in
immunological conditions such as sepsis. We analyzed the impact of the use of
CGRP antagonists in patients with migraine during the COVID-19 pandemic, caused
by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
METHODS: This is a multicentre cross-sectional study. From May to November 2020, 
through a national survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Neurology, we
collected data about the presence of COVID-19 symptoms including headache and
their characteristics and severity in patients with migraine treated with
anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and compared them with patients with
migraine not receiving this treatment. We also conducted a subanalysis of
patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
RESULTS: We recruited 300 patients with migraine: 51.7% (155/300) were taking
anti-CGRP mAbs; 87.3% were women (262/300). Mean age (standard deviation) was
47.1 years (11.6). Forty-one patients (13.7%) met diagnostic criteria for
COVID-19, with no statistically significant difference between patients with and 
without anti-CGRP mAb treatment (16.1% vs 11.0%, respectively; P=.320). Of the
patients with COVID-19, 48.8% (20/41) visited the emergency department and 12.2% 
(5/41) were hospitalised. Likewise, no clinical differences were found between
the groups of patients with and without anti-CGRP mAb treatment.
CONCLUSION: Anti-CGRP mAbs may be safe in clinical practice, presenting no
association with increased risk of COVID-19.
