Closing the gap in knowledge on the cause of neurodegenerative disorders is
paving the way toward innovative treatment strategies, among which gene therapy
has emerged as a top candidate. Both conventional gene therapy and genome editing
approaches are being developed, and a great number of human clinical trials are
ongoing. Already 2 years ago, the first gene therapy for a neurodegenerative
disease, spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1), obtained market approval. To
realize such innovative strategies, gene therapy delivery tools are key assets.
Here, we focus on recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and report on 
strategies to improve first-generation vectors. Current efforts focus on the
viral capsid to modify the host-vector interaction aiming at increasing the
efficacy of target cell transduction, at simplifying vector administration, and
at reducing the risk of vector dose-related side effects.
