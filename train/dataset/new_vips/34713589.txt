INTRODUCTION: The advent of COVID-19 has put pressure on health systems as they
implement measures to reduce the risk of transmission to people living with HIV
(PLHIV) and healthcare workers. For two out-of-facility individual differentiated
service delivery (DSD) models, we assessed acceptability of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) distribution through private pharmacies and reach of home delivery 
of ART through courier services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Botswana.
METHODS: From 24 July to 24 August 2020, we conducted exit interviews with PLHIV 
receiving ART from 10 high-volume public facilities in Gaborone, and mapped and
conducted an online survey with private pharmacies to assess willingness and
capacity to dispense ART to PLHIV enrolled in the Botswana national ART program. 
We piloted ART home delivery from September 2020 to January 2021 in Gaborone and 
Kweneng East districts for PLHIV accessing ART at two Tebelopele Wellness
Clinics. We used cascade analysis to measure the enrolment and eventual reach
(percentage of those reached amongst those who are eligible) of ART home
delivery.
RESULTS: Sixty-one PLHIV and 42 private pharmacies participated. Of the PLHIV
interviewed, 37 (61%) indicated willingness to access ART from private pharmacies
and pay BWP50 (∼US$4) per refill for a maximum of two refills per year. All
private pharmacies surveyed were willing to provide ART, and 26 (62%) would
charge a dispensing fee (range = BWP50-100; ∼US$4-8) per refill. All pharmacies
operated 12 h/day, 6 days/week and on public holidays. In the home delivery
pilot, 650 PLHIV were due for refills, 69.5% (n = 452) of whom were eligible for 
home delivery. Of these, 361 were successfully offered home delivery and 303
enrolled (enrolment = 83.9%: female = 87.2%, male = 77.8%, p = 0.013). A total of
276 deliveries were made, a reach of 61%.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing ART through private pharmacies and home delivery was
acceptable in Botswana during COVID-19. Surveyed pharmacies were willing and able
to dispense ART to PLHIV attending public sector facilities for free or for a
nominal fee. Additionally, using courier services for ART home delivery is a
novel and viable model in countries with a reliable courier service like Botswana
and should be scaled up, particularly in urban areas.
