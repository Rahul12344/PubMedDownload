Laboratory mice comprise an expeditious model for preclinical vaccine testing;
however, vaccine immunogenicity in these models often inadequately translates to 
humans. Reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen-free
(SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate human
immunity. We examined whether mice with diverse microbial experience better model
human responses post vaccination. We co-housed laboratory mice with pet-store
mice, which have varied microbial exposures, and then assessed immune responses
to influenza vaccines. Human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination
are better recapitulated in co-housed mice. Although SPF and co-housed mice were 
comparably susceptible to acute influenza infection, vaccine-induced humoral
responses were dampened in co-housed mice, resulting in poor control upon
challenge. Additionally, protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was
compromised in co-housed mice. Because SPF mice exaggerated humoral and T cell
protection upon influenza vaccination, reconstituting microbial experience in
laboratory mice through co-housing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.
