BACKGROUND AND AIM: The world of work has been profoundly affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic since workplace activities involving close contact with
coworkers and customers can lead to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and compromise
continuity of operations of workplaces. The Covid-Lab of University of Urbino and
the Confindustria Pesaro Urbino association signed an agreement to support the
Marche Nord companies in the adoption of anti-contagion safety protocols.
METHODS: Antibodies detection was performed using a rapid immunochromatographic
test. Total RNA from nasopharyngeal swab was subjected to a real-time RT-PCR
multiplex for the detection of RdRp specific gene and E gene of the SARS-CoV-2,
and the internal control (human RNase P).
RESULTS: Between May 2020 and Apr 2021, over 10,000 rapid serological tests had
been carried out on workers of 35 companies and in 5% of cases IgG or IgM were
found (519). All the 519 swabs gave a valid result (RNAse P Ct≤40) with 105
positive results (20%) for SARS-CoV-2 with a Ct value ≤45. Overall, only 1% of
samples resulted positive for viral RNA (105/10000).
CONCLUSIONS: The University of Urbino set up a rapid-response (within 24 h,
generally <6 h) diagnostic centre for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Covid-Lab) allowing
the companies to activate the optimal safety path to ensure the health and safety
of workers in the workplace. Our observations during this first year of activity,
highlight that in the workplace, the infection does not seem to spread if
precautionary measures are followed and only 1% (1 worker out of 100) tested
positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
