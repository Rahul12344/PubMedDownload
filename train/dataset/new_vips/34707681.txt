In December 2019, a new emerging virus causing mild-to-severe pneumonia was
detected in China. The virus was described as a variant of SARS-CoV and was
called SARS-CoV-2, then declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Millions
of people contracted the virus and presented with a symptomatology of variable
severity, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms and
diarrhea. We herein report a rare skin presentation in a 33-year-old female that 
occurred both during COVID-19 infection and after receiving the first dose of
COVID-19 vaccine.
