Importance: The influence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-related
hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown.
Controversy exists regarding whether to continue treatment for SDB with positive 
airway pressure given concern for aerosolization with limited data to inform
professional society recommendations.
Objective: To investigate the association of SDB (identified via polysomnogram)
and sleep-related hypoxia with (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity and (2) World Health
Organization (WHO)-designated COVID-19 clinical outcomes while accounting for
confounding including obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, and
smoking history.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study was conducted within
the Cleveland Clinic Health System (Ohio and Florida) and included all patients
who were tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and November 30, 2020, and who had
an available sleep study record. Sleep indices and SARS-CoV-2 positivity were
assessed with overlap propensity score weighting, and COVID-19 clinical outcomes 
were assessed using the institutional registry.
Exposures: Sleep study-identified SDB (defined by frequency of apneas and
hypopneas using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI]) and sleep-related hypoxemia
(percentage of total sleep time at <90% oxygen saturation [TST <90]).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and WHO-designated
COVID-19 clinical outcomes (hospitalization, use of supplemental oxygen,
noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, and death).
Results: Of 350 710 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5402 (mean [SD] age, 56.4 
[14.5] years; 3005 women [55.6%]) had a prior sleep study, of whom 1935 (35.8%)
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 5402 participants, 1696 were Black
(31.4%), 3259 were White (60.3%), and 822 were of other race or ethnicity
(15.2%). Patients who were positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a higher AHI
score (median, 16.2 events/h [IQR, 6.1-39.5 events/h] vs 13.6 events/h [IQR,
5.5-33.6 events/h]; P < .001) and increased TST <90 (median, 1.8% sleep time
[IQR, 0.10%-12.8% sleep time] vs 1.4% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-10.8% sleep time];
P = .02). After overlap propensity score-weighted logistic regression, no SDB
measures were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Median TST <90 was
associated with the WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.74; P = .005). Time-to-event analyses 
showed sleep-related hypoxia associated with a 31% higher rate of hospitalization
and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.57; P = .005).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related
hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once
patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated
risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes.
