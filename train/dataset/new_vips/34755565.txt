The precise mechanisms of pathology in severe COVID-19 remains elusive. Current
evidence suggests that inflammatory mediators are responsible for the
manifestation of clinical symptoms that precedes a fatal response to infection.
This review examines the nature of platelet activating factor and emphasizes the 
similarities between the physiological effects of platelet activating factor and 
the clinical complications of severe COVID-19.
