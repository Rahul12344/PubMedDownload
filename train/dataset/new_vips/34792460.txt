A coherent workforce strategy and consensus on essential staffing requirements
are needed to ensure quality in long-term care (LTC) homes. We have neither in
Canada. No Canadian studies, investigator driven or commissioned, exist to guide 
us. We generally rely on 20-year-old US recommendations, although we have never
actually implemented them. During, and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it
is clear that an insufficient workforce was at the root of much of the failure in
LTC to manage the pandemic. This commentary frames research on staffing and LTC
homes and the impact of COVID-19. It then outlines key ingredients, such as
knowledge of residents, the workforce and the care environment, that are needed
in order to estimate staffing needs. Recommendations for decision makers are
provided.
