PURPOSE: To evaluate ophthalmological emergencies (OE) during the COVID-19
pandemic comparing them with the same period of the previous year.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study of all OE visits in four tertiary
hospitals in Spain comparing data from March 16th to April 30th, 2020 (COVID-19
period) and the same period of 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period). Severity of the
conditions was assessed following Channa et al. publication. Data on
demographics, diagnosis and treatments were collected from Electronic Medical
Records.
RESULTS: During lockdown, OE significantly declined by 75.18%, from 7,730
registered in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1,928 attended during the COVID-19
period (p < 0.001). In 2019, 23.86% of visits were classified as emergent, 59.50%
as non-emergent, and 16.65% could not be determined. In 2020, the percentage of
emergent visits increased up to 29.77%, non-emergent visits significantly
decreased to 52.92% (p < 0.001), and 17.31% of the visits were classified as
"could not determine". During the pandemic, people aged between 45 and 65 years
old represented the largest attending group (37.89%), compared to 2019, where
patients over 65 years were the majority (39.80%). In 2019, most frequent
diagnosis was unspecified acute conjunctivitis (11.59%), followed by vitreous
degeneration (6.47%), and punctate keratitis (5.86%). During the COVID-19 period,
vitreous degeneration was the first cause for consultation (9.28%), followed by
unspecified acute conjunctivitis (5.63%) and punctate keratitis (5.85%).
CONCLUSIONS: OE visits dropped significantly during the pandemic in Spain
(75.18%), although more than half were classified as non-urgent conditions,
indicating a lack of understanding of the really emergent ocular pathologies
among population.
