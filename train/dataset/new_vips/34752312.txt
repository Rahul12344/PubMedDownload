BACKGROUND: Moderate and severe COVID-19 patients typically present with
pneumonia. In this study we aimed to detect the occurrence of pulmonary residuals
as a late sequela of COVID-19 and to identify it's predictors among moderate and 
severe cases.
METHODS: This observational prospective study involved 85 COVID-19 patients
confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab,
patients were recruited in the period of 1 st of June to 1 st of July.
Demographic and clinical data were obtained for each patient. Chest imaging was
performed initially and after 3 weeks to detect post COVID pulmonary residuals.
RESULTS: The study population included 74 (87.1%) moderate and 11 (12.9%) severe 
patients. Patients with older age, male gender, high BMI and initial chest CT of 
consolidation/mixed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGOs) had more
frequent post COVID-19 pulmonary residuals (P 0.003, 0.026, 0.031, 0.035)
respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between patients
who showed complete resolution and patients who developed pulmonary residuals
regarding the lymphocyte count, serum CRP and ferritin levels (P 0.0001). After
logistic regression, male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of
consolidation/mixed consolidation and GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and
ferritin levels were the predictors of pulmonary residuals. While the age wasn't 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: 38.5% of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients tend to have pulmonary
residuals. Independent predictors of pulmonary residuals as a sequela of COVID-19
are male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of consolidation and mixed
consolidation/GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and ferritin levels.
