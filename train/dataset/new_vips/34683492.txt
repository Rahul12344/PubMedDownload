Lumpy skin disease (LSD) diagnosis is primarily based on clinical surveillance
complemented by PCR of lesion crusts or nodule biopsies. Since LSD can be
subclinical, the sensitivity of clinical surveillance could be lower than
expected. Furthermore, real-time PCR for the detection of LSD viral DNA in blood 
samples from subclinical animals is only intermittently positive. Therefore, this
study aimed to investigate an acceptable, easily applicable and more sensitive
testing method for the detection of clinical and subclinical LSD. An animal
experiment was conducted to investigate ear notches and biopsies from unaffected 
skin taken from the neck and dorsal back as alternatives to blood samples. It was
concluded that for early LSD confirmation, normal skin biopsies and ear notches
are less fit for purpose, as LSDV DNA is only detectable in these samples several
days after it is detectable in blood samples. On the other hand, blood samples
are less advisable for the detection of subclinical animals, while ear notches
and biopsies were positive for LSD viral DNA in all subclinically infected
animals by 16 days post infection. In conclusion, ear notches could be used for
surveillance to detect subclinical animals after removing the clinical animals
from a herd, to regain trade by substantiating the freedom of disease or to
support research on LSDV transmission from subclinical animals.
