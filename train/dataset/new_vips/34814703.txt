Background: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA2) mediates
a2+-reuptake into SR and thereby promotes cardiomyocyte relaxation, whereas the
ryanodine receptor (RYR) mediates a2+-release from SR and triggers contraction.
a2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates activities of
SERCA2 through phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) and RYR through direct
phosphorylation. However, the mechanisms for CaMKIIδ anchoring to SERCA2-PLN and 
RYR and its regulation by local a2+-signals remain elusive. The objective of this
study was to investigate CaMKIIδ anchoring and regulation at SERCA2-PLN and RYR. 
Methods: A role for A-kinase anchoring protein 18δ (AKAP18δ) in CaMKIIδ anchoring
and regulation was analyzed by bioinformatics, peptide arrays, cell-permeant
peptide technology, immunoprecipitations, pull-downs, transfections,
immunoblotting, proximity ligation, FRET-based CaMKII activity and ELISA-based
assays, whole cell and SR-vesicle fluorescence imaging, high-resolution
microscopy, adenovirus transduction, adeno-associated virus injection, structural
modeling, surface plasmon resonance and alpha screen technology. Results: Our
results show that AKAP18δ anchors and directly regulates CaMKIIδ activity at
SERCA2-PLN and RYR, via two distinct AKAP18δ regions. An N-terminal region
(AKAP18δ-N) inhibited CaMKIIδ through binding of a region homologous to natural
CaMKII inhibitor peptide and Thr17-PLN region. AKAP18δ-N also bound CaM,
introducing a second level of control. Conversely, AKAP18δ-C, which shares
homology to neuronal CaMKIIα activator peptide (N2B-s), activated CaMKIIδ by
lowering the apparent a2+-threshold for kinase activation and inducing CaM
trapping. While AKAP18δ-C facilitated faster a2+-reuptake by SERCA2 and
a2+-release through RYR, AKAP18δ-N had opposite effects. We propose a model where
the two unique AKAP18δ regions fine-tune a2+-frequency-dependent activation of
CaMKIIδ at SERCA2-PLN and RYR. Conclusions: AKAP18δ anchors and functionally
regulates CaMKII activity at PLN-SERCA2 and RYR, indicating a crucial role of
AKAP18δ in regulation of the heartbeat. To our knowledge this is the first
protein shown to enhance CaMKII activity in heart and also the first AKAP
reported to anchor a CaMKII isoform, defining AKAP18δ also as a CaM-KAP.
