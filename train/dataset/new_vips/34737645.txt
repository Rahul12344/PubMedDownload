Purpose: To estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code U07.1, COVID-19 virus
identified, in the Department of Veterans of Affairs (VA).
Patients and Methods: Records of ICD-10 code U07.1 from inpatient, outpatient,
and emergency/urgent care settings were extracted from VA medical record data
from 4/01/2020 to 3/31/2021. A weighted, random sample of 1500 records from each 
quarter of the one-year observation period was reviewed by study personnel to
confirm active COVID-19 infection at the time of diagnosis and classify reasons
for false positive records. PPV was estimated overall and compared across
clinical setting and quarters.
Results: We identified 664,406 records of U07.1. Among the 1500 reviewed, 237
were false positives (PPV: 84.2%, 95% CI: 82.4-86.0). PPV ranged from 77.7% in
outpatient settings to 93.8% in inpatient settings and was 83.3% in quarter 1,
80.5% in quarter 2, 86.1% in quarter 3, and 83.6% in quarter 4. The most common
reasons for false positive records were history of COVID-19 (44.3%) and orders
for laboratory tests (21.5%).
Conclusion: The PPV of ICD-10 code U07.1 is low, especially in outpatient
settings. Directed training may improve accuracy of coding to levels that are
deemed adequate for future use in surveillance efforts.
