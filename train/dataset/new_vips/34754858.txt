BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be caused by hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection. Post-infection recovery-associated changes of HBV indicators
include decreased hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level and increased
anti-HBsAg antibody titer. Testing to detect HBV DNA is conducted rarely but
could detect latent HBV infection persisting after acute infection and prompt
administration of treatments to clear HBV and prevent subsequent HBV-induced HCC 
development. Here, we present an HCC case with an extremely high anti-HBsAg
antibody titer and latent HBV infection.
CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old male patient with abdominal pain who was diagnosed
with primary HCC presented with an extremely high level (over 2000 ng/mL) of
serum alpha-fetoprotein. Abdominal B-ultrasonography and computed tomography scan
results indicated focal liver lesion and mild splenomegaly. Assessments of
serological markers revealed a high titer of antibodies against hepatitis B core 
antigen (anti-HBcAg antibodies), an extremely high titer (1000 mIU/mL) of
hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBsAg antibodies, anti-HBs) and absence of
detectible HBsAg. Medical records indicated that the patient had reported no
history of HBV vaccination, infection or hepatitis. Therefore, to rule out latent
HBV infection in this patient, a serum sample was collected then tested to detect
HBV DNA, yielding a positive result. Based on the aforementioned information, the
final diagnosis was HCC associated with hepatitis B in a compensated stage of
liver dysfunction and the patient was hospitalized for surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION: A rare HCC case with high serum anti-HBsAg antibody titer and
detectable HBV DNA resulted from untreated latent HBV infection.
