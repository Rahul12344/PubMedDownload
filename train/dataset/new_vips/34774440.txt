BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Convalescent plasma has attracted significant
attention as a therapeutic option against infectious agents for more than a
century. In March 2020, the use of Convalescent COVID-19 plasma (CCP) as a new
research drug for COVID-19 treatment was approved by the FDA. The development of 
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following infection or vaccination is likely to be
essential to provide adequate immunity for the population to halt the COVID19
pandemic. This study aimed to identify the criteria that would be used to
determine the most appropriate CCP donors with the highest effective antiviral
antibody titers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort, univariate analyses and
multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship
between characteristics of 11949 CCP donors and COVID-19 disease severity prior
to donation with antibody titers estimated using ELISA technique and rapid tests.
RESULTS: The antibody titer was measured among 8206 (68.7 %) donors. Elderly male
and nulliparous female CCP donors who resided in the areas with high load of
virus had positive ELISA and rapid test results as well as high levels of
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies titer. Moreover, the long hospital stay and elderly
donors were the variables associated with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that nulliparous female and male donors with
positive rapid tests who resided in areas with a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2,
with more than 40 years of age and long hospitalization time can be the preferred
donors for CCP donation.
