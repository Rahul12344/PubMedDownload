Identification of a universal influenza vaccine candidate has remained a global
challenge for both humans and animals. This study describes an approach that uses
consensus sequence building to generate chimeric HAs (cHAs): two resultant H1
HA-based chimeras comprising of conserved sequences (within several areas
spanning the head and stalk regions) of H1 and H5 or H9 HAs. These cHAs expressed
in Drosophila cells (S2) were used to immunize mice. All immunized mice were
protected from an infectious H1 virus challenge. Seroconverted mice sera to the
H1 cHAs inhibited both the challenge virus and an H5 virus isolate by
haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. These findings further emphasize that
cHAs induce cross-reactive antibodies against conserved areas of both head and
stalk regions of the seasonal influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus' HA and holds
potential for further development of a universal influenza vaccine.
