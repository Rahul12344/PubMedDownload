The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to medical education.
The patient care space was unavailable as a learning environment, which
compounded the complexity of preparing students for clerkships with a traditional
transition to clerkship (TTC) curriculum. We developed a multimodal, structured
approach to re-introduce students to the clinical space prior to the start of
clerkships. 105 second year medical students completed a 4-week clinical
enhancement course. A modified Delphi method was used to select core topics,
which were then anchored to key Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs).
Students participated in 9 virtual problem-based cases, workshops and multiple
supervised patient encounters. Students were surveyed before, during, and after
the course; responses were compared with paired t-tests. 25.9% rated the course
as excellent, 44.2% as very good, and 19.5% as good. Compared to baseline,
self-perceived efficacy grew significantly (P < 0.05) across all EPAs.
Improvements in key competencies were sustained when students were surveyed
2 weeks into their first clerkship. This was a well-received, novel course,
focused on helping students transition back into the clinical space through a
multimodal teaching approach. This framework may be used by other institutions
seeking to restructure their TTC initiatives.
