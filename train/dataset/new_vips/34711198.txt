BACKGROUND: There are uncertainties about mitigating strategies for
swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an 
opportunity to learn from the experience of previous re-openings to better plan
the future one. Our objectives are to systematically review the evidence on (1)
the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19
transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19
transmission during swimming-related activities.
METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review. We searched in the L·OVE (Living
OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19. The searches covered the period from
the inception date of each database until April 19, 2021. We included
non-randomized studies for the review on association of COVID-19 transmission and
swimming-related activities. We included guidance documents reporting on the
strategies for prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related
activities. We also included studies on the efficacy and safety of the
strategies. Teams of two reviewers independently assessed article eligibility.
For the guidance documents, a single reviewer assessed the eligibility and a
second reviewer verified the judgement. Teams of two reviewers extracted data
independently. We summarized the findings of included studies narratively. We
synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified
topics and subtopics, and presented them in tabular and narrative formats.
RESULTS: We identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for
the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19
transmission. The analysis of 50 eligible guidance documents identified 11
topics: ensuring social distancing, ensuring personal hygiene, using personal
protective equipment, eating and drinking, maintaining the pool, managing
frequently touched surfaces, ventilation of indoor spaces, screening and
management of sickness, delivering first aid, raising awareness, and vaccination.
One study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission
did not find an association between compliance with precautionary restrictions
and COVID-19 transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: There are major gaps in the research evidence of relevance to
swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the
synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public 
health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in
future re-opening plans.
