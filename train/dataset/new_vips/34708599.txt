The international cooperation project "electricity-driven low energy and chemical
input technology for accelerated bioremediation" (abridged as "ELECTRA") is
jointly supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and
European Commission (EC). The ELECTRA consortium consists of 5 research
institutions and universities from China and 17 European research institutions
and universities, as well as high-tech companies of EC countries. ELECTRA focuses
on researches of biodegradation of emerging organic compounds (EOCs) and novel
environmental biotechnologies of low-energy and low-chemical inputs. The project 
has been successfully operated for 2 years, and has made important progresses in 
obtaining EOCs-degrading microbes, developing weak-electricity-accelerated
bioremediation, and 3D-printing techniques for microbial consortium. The ELECTRA 
has promoted collaborations among the Chinese and European scientists. In the
future, ELECTRA will overcome the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
fulfill the scientific objectives through strengthening the international
collaboration.
