INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been shown to 
increase levels of psychological distress among healthcare workers. Little is
known, however, about specific positive and negative individual and
organizational factors that affect the mental health of emergency physicians (EP)
during COVID-19. Our objective was to assess these factors in a broad geographic 
sample of EPs in the United States.
METHODS: We conducted an electronic, prospective, cross-sectional national survey
of EPs from October 6-December 29, 2020. Measures assessed negative mental health
outcomes (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia), positive
work-related outcomes, and strategies used to cope with COVID-19. After
preliminary analyses and internal reliability testing, we performed four separate
three-stage hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine individual and
organizational predictive factors for psychological distress.
RESULTS: Response rate was 50%, with 517 EPs completing the survey from 11
different sites. Overall, 85% of respondents reported negative psychological
effects due to COVID-19. Participants reported feeling more stressed (31%),
lonelier (26%), more anxious (25%), more irritable (24%) and sadder (17.5%).
Prevalence of mental health conditions was 17% for depression, 13% for anxiety,
7.5% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 18% for insomnia. Regular
exercise decreased from 69% to 56%, while daily alcohol use increased from 8% to 
15%. Coping strategies of behavioral disengagement, self-blame, and venting were 
significant predictors of psychological distress, while humor and positive
reframing were negatively associated with psychological distress.
CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians have experienced high levels of psychological
distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those using avoidant coping strategies
were most likely to experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD, while
humor and positive reframing were effective coping strategies.
