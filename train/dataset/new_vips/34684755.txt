There have been more than 150 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 since the
beginning of the pandemic in 2019. By June 2021, the mortality from such
infections approached 3.9 million people. Despite the availability of a number of
vaccines which provide protection against this virus, the evolution of new viral 
variants, inconsistent availability of the vaccine around the world, and vaccine 
hesitancy, in some countries, makes it unreasonable to rely on mass vaccination
alone to combat this pandemic. Consequently, much effort is directed to
identifying potential antiviral treatments. Marine brominated tyrosine alkaloids 
are recognized to have antiviral potential. We test here the antiviral capacity
of fourteen marine brominated tyrosine alkaloids against five different target
proteins from SARS-CoV-2, including main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike
glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane
glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) (PDB ID:
6W4H). These marine alkaloids, particularly the hexabrominated compound,
fistularin-3, shows promising docking interactions with predicted binding
affinities (S-score = -7.78, -7.65, -6.39, -6.28, -8.84 Kcal/mol) for the main
protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and
non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H), respectively, where it forms
better interactions with the protein pockets than the native interaction. It also
shows promising molecular dynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles. As
such, further exploration of the antiviral properties of fistularin-3 against
SARS-CoV-2 is merited.
