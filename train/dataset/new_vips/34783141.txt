As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell 
exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR-T cells that 
is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C
virus NS3 protease (HCV-NS3) between the single-chain variable fragment (scFv)
and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti-CD19 scFv on CAR-T cells
was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV-NS3 inhibitor
asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti-CD19
scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a
practically recurring chemical switch. We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T
cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a
dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate
modulation of CAR-T activation during cancer treatment.
