OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to evaluate and compare the lipocalin,
adiponectin and periodontal viruses in the generalized periodontitis patients
with and without diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy subjects were grouped into 35 systemically healthy
(GP) and 35 patients with Diabetes Mellitus (GP+DM). The periodontal parameters, 
demographic and diabetic variables were evaluated in both the groups. The
subgingival tissue samples were procured from the diseased sites and were
analysed for the detection of EBV, CMV, HSV and protein markers by Real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and lipocalin and adiponectin were identified 
by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: The demographic variables such as age and BMI did not differ between the
groups. PI and CAL were found to be significantly higher in GP+DM (p < 0.05). EBV
(82.9%), CMV (71.4%) and protein marker: lipocalin were also found to be
statistically highly significant in GP+DM and adiponectin was found to be higher 
in GP group and reduced in GP+DM group (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The increased prevalence of EBV and CMV and lipocalin with reduced
levels of adiponectin in patients with diabetes and periodontitis which may show 
aggravation of the diabetic status of the periodontitis patients thereby
reinforcing a strong Periodontitis-DM continuum.
