Lassa virus is endemic in West Africa and can cause severe hemorrhagic fever. The
viral L protein transcribes and replicates the RNA genome via its RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase activity. Here, we present nine cryo-EM structures of the L
protein in the apo-, promoter-bound pre-initiation and active RNA synthesis
states. We characterize distinct binding pockets for the conserved 3' and 5'
promoter RNAs and show how full-promoter binding induces a distinct
pre-initiation conformation. In the apo- and early elongation states, the
endonuclease is inhibited by two distinct L protein peptides, whereas in the
pre-initiation state it is uninhibited. In the early elongation state, a
template-product duplex is bound in the active site cavity together with an
incoming non-hydrolysable nucleotide and the full C-terminal region of the L
protein, including the putative cap-binding domain, is well-ordered. These data
advance our mechanistic understanding of how this flexible and multifunctional
molecular machine is activated.
