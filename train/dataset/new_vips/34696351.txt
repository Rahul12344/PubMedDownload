The nucleocapsid (NC) protein of human immunodeficiency (HIV) is a small, highly 
basic protein containing two CCHC zinc-finger motifs, which is cleaved from the
NC domain of the Gag polyprotein during virus maturation. We previously reported 
that recombinant HIV-1 Gag and NCp7 overexpressed in an E. coli host contains two
and one zinc ions, respectively, and Gag exhibited much higher selectivity for
packaging signal (Psi) and affinity for the stem-loop (SL)-3 of Psi than NCp7. In
this study, we prepared NCp7 containing 0 (0NCp7), 1 (NCp7) or 2 (2NCp7) zinc
ions, and compared their secondary structure, Psi-selectivity and SL3-affinity.
Along with the decrease of the zinc content, less ordered conformations were
detected. Compared to NCp7, 2NCp7 exhibited a much higher Psi-selectivity and
SL3-affinity, similar to Gag, whereas 0NCp7 exhibited a lower Psi-selectivity and
SL3-affinity, similar to the H23&H44K double mutant of NCp7, indicating that the 
different RNA-binding property of Gag NC domain and the mature NCp7 may be
resulted, at least partially, from their different zinc content. This study will 
be helpful to elucidate the critical roles that zinc played in the viral life
cycle, and benefit further investigations of the functional switch from the NC
domain of Gag to the mature NCp7.
