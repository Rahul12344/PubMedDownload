To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ergoferon in combination with symptomatic 
therapy in children from 6 months to 6 years old with acute respiratory
infections (ARI) in contemporary outpatient practice, an international,
multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group
clinical trial was performed. Derived by technological treatment of antibodies to
interferon gamma, histamine, and CD4, Ergoferon was previously proved to modulate
its molecular targets promoting effective antiviral protection. The data of 282
patients with oral temperature ≥38.0°C plus mild to moderate severity of flu-like
nonspecific and nasal/throat/chest symptoms were included in intention-to-treat
analysis (n = 140, Ergoferon group; n = 142, placebo group). Time to alleviation 
of all ARI symptoms was the primary endpoint, and 8 outcome measures were
estimated as the secondary endpoints. Respiratory viruses were confirmed in 57.1%
(Ergoferon) and 54.9% (Placebo) of patients. Compared to placebo, Ergoferon
reduced time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms (4.5 ± 1.7 versus 5.2 ± 2.2 days 
in placebo; p=0.026) including fever (2.8 ± 1.5 vs 3.4 ± 2.0; p=0.031), flu-like 
nonspecific (4.0 ± 1.8 vs 4.7 ± 2.2, p=0.022), and nasal/throat/chest (4.3 ± 2.0 
versus 5.0 ± 2.3; p=0.024) symptoms. Ergoferon add-on therapy decreased the mean 
total symptom severity score (according to 4-point scale for each symptom), ARI
severity, frequency of antipyretic use, and percentage of complication requiring 
antibiotics and increased the percentage of recovered patients. The incidence of 
adverse events (AEs) in the Ergoferon group was significantly lower compared to
the placebo group (7.0% versus 18.8%; p=0.004) including infectious diseases
(3.5% vs 12.5%; p=0.008). In the Ergoferon group, AEs were mild or moderate. In 8
(57.1%) cases, AEs were unrelated to Ergoferon, in 5 (35.7%), the relationship
was uncertain, and in 1 (7.1%), it was possible (mild rash on the face).
Ergoferon treatment is beneficial for infants and young children with ARI in
contemporary outpatient practice. Being well-tolerated, Ergoferon increases the
symptomatic therapy effectiveness and improves the patient condition and disease 
outcomes.
