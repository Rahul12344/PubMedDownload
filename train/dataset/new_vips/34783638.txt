In 2021, three encephalitis cases due to the Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) were 
diagnosed in the north and east of Germany. The patients were from the states of 
Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Lower Saxony. All were residents of known endemic
areas for animal Borna disease but without prior diagnosed human cases. Except
for one recently detected case in the state of Brandenburg, all >30 notified
cases had occurred in, or were linked to, the southern state of Bavaria. Of the
three detected cases described here, two infections were acute, while one
infection was diagnosed retrospectively from archived brain autopsy tissue
samples. One of the acute cases survived, but is permanently disabled. The cases 
were diagnosed by various techniques (serology, molecular assays, and
immunohistology) following a validated testing scheme and adhering to a proposed 
case definition. Two cases were classified as confirmed BoDV-1 encephalitis,
while one case was a probable infection with positive serology and typical brain 
magnetic resonance imaging, but without molecular confirmation. Of the three
cases, one full virus genome sequence could be recovered. Our report highlights
the need for awareness of a BoDV-1 etiology in cryptic encephalitis cases in all 
areas with known animal Borna disease endemicity in Europe, including
virus-endemic regions in Austria, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. BoDV-1 should
be actively tested for in acute encephalitis cases with residence or rural
exposure history in known Borna disease-endemic areas.
