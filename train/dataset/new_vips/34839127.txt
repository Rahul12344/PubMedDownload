COVID-19 symptomology may overlap with other circulating respiratory viruses that
may also cause severe disease and for which there are specific and potentially
life-saving treatments. The Abbott Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is a multiplex PCR
assay that simultaneously detects and differentiates infection with SARS-CoV-2,
influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We characterized
its accuracy, precision, and analytical sensitivity. All were found to be robust 
for measures examined. In the context of sample-to-answer, near random access
automation on the Alinity m platform, we believe that the Resp-4-Plex assay
offers significant utility in addressing the current needs of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic and future needs during anticipated endemic circulation of SARS-CoV-2
with other respiratory viruses.
