Problem: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic adversely
affected the preparation of Malaysia's National Health and Morbidity Survey for
2020 because conducting it would expose data collectors and participants to an
increased risk of infection.
Context: The survey is nationally representative and community based and is
conducted by the Institute for Public Health, part of the National Institutes of 
Health, to generate health-related evidence and to support the Malaysian Ministry
of Health in policy-making. Its planned scope for 2020 was the seroprevalence of 
communicable diseases such as hepatitis B and C.
Action: Additional components were added to the survey to increase its
usefulness, including COVID-19 seroprevalence and facial anthropometric studies
to ensure respirator fit. The survey's scale was reduced, and data collection was
changed from including only face-to-face interviews to mainly self-administered
and telephone interviews. The transmission risk to participants was reduced by
screening data collectors before the survey and fortnightly thereafter, using
standard droplet and contact precautions, ensuring proper training and monitoring
of data collectors, and implementing other administrative infection prevention
measures.
Outcome: Data were collected from 7 August to 11 October 2020, with 5957
participants recruited. Only 4 out of 12 components of the survey were conducted 
via face-to-face interview. No COVID-19 cases were reported among data collectors
and participants. All participants were given their hepatitis and COVID-19
laboratory test results; 73 participants with hepatitis B and 14 with hepatitis C
who had been previously undiagnosed were referred for further case management.
Discussion: Preparing and conducting the National Health and Morbidity Survey
during the COVID-19 pandemic required careful consideration of the risks and
benefits, multiple infection prevention measures, strong leadership and strong
stakeholder support to ensure there were no adverse events.
