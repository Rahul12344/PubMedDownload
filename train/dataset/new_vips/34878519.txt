The neuronal axon is packed with cytoskeletal filaments, membranes, and
organelles, many of which move between the cell body and axon tip. Here, we used 
cryo-electron tomography to survey the internal components of mammalian sensory
axons. We determined the polarity of the axonal microtubules (MTs) by combining
subtomogram classification and visual inspection, finding MT plus and minus ends 
are structurally similar. Subtomogram averaging of globular densities in the MT
lumen suggests they have a defined structure, which is surprising given they
likely contain the disordered protein MAP6. We found the endoplasmic reticulum in
axons is tethered to MTs through multiple short linkers. We surveyed
membrane-bound cargos and describe unexpected internal features such as granules 
and broken membranes. In addition, we detected proteinaceous compartments,
including numerous virus-like capsid particles. Our observations outline novel
features of axonal cargos and MTs, providing a platform for identification of
their constituents.
