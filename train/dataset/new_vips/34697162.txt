BACKGROUND: The study provides a novel prediction model for COVID-19 progression 
and outcome by the combination of the CD8+: B-cells ratio with
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immune phenotyping was performed in 120 COVID-19 patients.
RESULTS: A decrease in CD8+:B-cell (p<0.0001) and in lymphocyte-to-CRP (LCR)
ratio (p<0.0001) was observed in intubated patients versus non-intubated with an 
increase for CD4+:CD8+ (p<0.01), NLR (p<0.0001) and CRP: Albumin (p<0.001).
Receiving operating curve (ROC) analysis predicting requirement for mechanical
ventilation revealed the highest AUC for CD8+:B-cells, (AUC=0.795, p<0.001)
versus NLR (AUC=0.783, p<0.001), LCR (AUC=0.779, p<0.001), Albumin:CRP
(AUC=0.750, p<0.001) and CD4+:CD8+ (AUC=0.779, p<0.001). Combination of the CD8+:
B-cell ratio with the NLR increased the AUC (AUC=0.845, p<0.001). The combined
ratios correlated with outcome defined as duration of hospital (r=0.435, p<0.001)
or ICU stay (r=0.596, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Combination of the CD8+: B-cell ratio and NLR serves as a useful
prognostic tool for COVID-19 patient progression.
