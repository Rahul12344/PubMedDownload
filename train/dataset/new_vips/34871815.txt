AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel virus that is
responsible for the largest pandemic in recent times. Although numerous studies
have explored methods to cope with COVID-19 and targeted drugs and vaccines have 
been developed, the spread of disease remains rapid due to the high infectivity
and mutation capability of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19.
Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to seek more efficient treatments and
approaches to combat the disease.
MAIN METHODS: In this study, molecular docking was used to predict the binding of
different lipopeptides, which exhibit significant biological functions, to the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (also known as nsp12) of SARS-CoV-2, the central
component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery.
KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that seven lipopeptides bound to nsp12 at the
same location as the FDA-approved drug remdesivir, with higher affinities.
Notably, iron-chelating ferrocin A (ferrocin A-iron complex [FAC]) bound to nsp12
most tightly, releasing up to 9.1 kcal mol-1 of free energy. Protein-ligand
interaction analysis revealed that FAC formed four hydrogen bonds, two
hydrophobic interactions, and three salt bridges with nsp12. These active amino
acids are mainly distributed in the fingers and thumb subdomains of nsp12 and are
highly conserved.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the abovementioned lipopeptides can
tightly bind to nsp12, and thus represent promising drug candidates for
anti-coronaviral treatments with the potential to fight SARS-CoV-2.
