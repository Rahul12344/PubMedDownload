The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global
event that has been challenging governments, health systems, and communities
worldwide. Available data from the first months indicated varying patterns of the
spread of COVID-19 within American cities, when the spread was faster in
high-density and walkable cities such as New York than in low-density and
car-oriented cities such as Los Angeles. Subsequent containment efforts,
underlying population characteristics, variants, and other factors likely
affected the spread significantly. However, this work investigates the hypothesis
that urban configuration and associated spatial use patterns directly impact how 
the disease spreads and infects a population. It follows work that has shown how 
the spatial configuration of urban spaces impacts the social behavior of people
moving through those spaces. It addresses the first 60 days of contagion (before 
containment measures were widely adopted and had time to affect spread) in 93
urban counties in the United States, considering population size, population
density, walkability, here evaluated through walkscore, an indicator that
measures the density of amenities, and, therefore, opportunities for population
mixing, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths. Our findings indicate
correlations between walkability, population density, and COVID-19 spreading
patterns but no clear correlation between population size and the number of cases
or deaths per 100 k habitants. Although virus spread beyond these initial cases
may provide additional data for analysis, this study is an initial step in
understanding the relationship between COVID-19 and urban configuration.
