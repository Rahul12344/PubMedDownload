BACKGROUND: Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is a re-emerging disease caused by
bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV). Although it poses a huge economic threat to 
the livestock sector, complete viral genome information from any South Asian
country, including India, lacks.
AIM: Genome characterization of the first Indian BEFV isolate and to evaluate its
genetic diversity by characterizing genomic mutations and their associated
protein dynamics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the nineteen positive blood samples collected from BEF 
symptomatic animals during the 2018-19 outbreaks in India, one random sample was 
used to amplify the entire viral genome by RT-PCR. Utilizing Sanger sequencing
and NGS technology, a complete genome was determined. Genome characterization,
genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses were explored by comparing the
results with available global isolates. Additionally, unique genomic mutations
within the Indian isolate were investigated, followed by in-silico assessment of 
non-synonymous (NS) mutations impacts on corresponding proteins' secondary
structure, solvent accessibility and dynamics.
RESULTS: The complete genome of Indian BEFV has 14,903 nucleotides with 33% GC
with considerable genetic diversity. Its sequence comparison and phylogenetic
analysis revealed a close relatedness to the Middle Eastern lineage. Genome-wide 
scanning elucidated 30 unique mutations, including 10â€‰NS mutations in the P, L
and GNS proteins. The mutational impact evaluation confirmed alterations in
protein structure and dynamics, with minimal effect on solvent accessibility.
Additionally, alteration in the interatomic interactions was compared against the
wild type.
CONCLUSION: These findings extend our understanding of the BEFV epidemiological
and pathogenic potential, aiding in developing better therapeutic and preventive 
interventions.
