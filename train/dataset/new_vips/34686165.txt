BACKGROUND: With the unprecedented expansion of COVID-19 in the world since
December 2019, Iran's health system, like other countries, faced various
challenges in managing the disease, which led to numerous experiences and lessons
learned. This study was conducted to identify these challenges regarding unique
political, economic, and cultural issues, which could help other countries with
similar situations.
METHODS: The present study was performed using a qualitative multi-method
approach with a content analysis method. The data were collected through in-depth
and semi-structured interviews and focused group discussions with 60 key persons 
who were selected purposefully, including policymakers, health care workers, and 
affected people by the disease, and the review of all available national reports 
between February 21, 2020, and March 22, 2021. The data collection and analysis
were done simultaneously.
RESULTS: Identified critical challenges for the management of COVID-19 in the
health system were limited evidence and scientific controversies, poor social
prevention and social inequalities, burnout and sustained workload among
healthcare workers, improper management of resources and equipment, the lack of a
guideline for contact tracing, and patient flow management, and mental health
problems in the community.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, measures should be taken to conduct a
continuous comprehensive risk assessment and develop a national response plan
with an emphasis on precise contact tracing, active screening, patient flow,
paying attention to the psychological and social dimensions of the disease, and
also transparency of social inequalities in the face of risk factors of the
COVID-19. Also, the social protection programs should become a vital tool for
policymakers and supporting the vulnerable groups using the capacity of the
community and international cooperation to develop a vaccine, which is difficult 
to procure due to the sanctions.
