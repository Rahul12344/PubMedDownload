The novel coronavirus disease pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has infected 
millions of people around the world with a surge in transmission and mortality
rates. Although it is a respiratory viral infection that affects airway
epithelial cells, a diverse set of complications, including cytokine storm,
gastrointestinal disorders, neurological distress, and hyperactive immune
responses have been reported. However, growing evidence indicates that the
bidirectional crosstalk of the gut-lung axis can decipher the complexity of the
disease. Though not much research has been focused on the gut-lung axis
microbiome, there is a translocation of COVID-19 infection from the lung to the
gut through the lymphatic system resulting in disruption of gut permeability and 
its integrity. It is believed that detailed elucidation of the gut-lung axis
crosstalk and the role of microbiota can unravel the most significant insights on
the discovery of diagnosis using microbiome-based-therapeutics for COVID-19. This
review calls attention to relate the influence of dysbiosis caused by COVID-19
and the involvement of the gut-lung axis. It presents first of its kind details
that concentrate on the momentousness of biotics in disease progression and
restoration.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
