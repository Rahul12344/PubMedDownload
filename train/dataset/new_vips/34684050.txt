(Background) COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and may result in
unfavorable outcomes. A recent large-scale study showed that treatment with
dexamethasone leads to favorable outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, and
the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has also been shown to
improve outcomes. Recently, secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP) has been
reported after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the diagnostic and treatment strategies 
are still unclear. (Case presentation) Here, we report a patient with severe
COVID-19 who developed SOP even after the use of dexamethasone, for whom the
introduction of ECMO on the 19th day after hospitalization led to a favorable
outcome. (Conclusions) Life-threatening SOP may evolve even after the use of
dexamethasone, and the late-phase introduction of ECMO may save such patients
with COVID-19.
