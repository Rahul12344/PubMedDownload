The current COVID-19 pandemic has substantially accelerated the demands for
efficient vaccines. A wide spectrum of approaches includes live attenuated and
inactivated viruses, protein subunits and peptides, viral vector-based delivery, 
DNA plasmids, and synthetic mRNA. Preclinical studies have demonstrated robust
immune responses, reduced viral loads and protection against challenges with
SARS-CoV-2 in rodents and primates. Vaccine candidates based on all delivery
systems mentioned above have been subjected to clinical trials in healthy
volunteers. Phase I clinical trials have demonstrated in preliminary findings
good safety and tolerability. Evaluation of immune responses in a small number of
individuals has demonstrated similar or superior levels of neutralizing
antibodies in comparison to immunogenicity detected in COVID-19 patients. Both
adenovirus- and mRNA-based vaccines have entered phase II and study protocols for
phase III trials with 30,000 participants have been finalized.
