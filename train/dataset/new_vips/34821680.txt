Separation of micro- and nano-sized biological particles, such as cells,
proteins, and nucleotides, is at the heart of most biochemical sensing/analysis, 
including in vitro biosensing, diagnostics, drug development, proteomics, and
genomics. However, most of the conventional particle separation techniques are
based on membrane filtration techniques, whose efficiency is limited by membrane 
characteristics, such as pore size, porosity, surface charge density, or
biocompatibility, which results in a reduction in the separation efficiency of
bioparticles of various sizes and types. In addition, since other conventional
separation methods, such as centrifugation, chromatography, and precipitation,
are difficult to perform in a continuous manner, requiring multiple preparation
steps with a relatively large minimum sample volume is necessary for stable
bioprocessing. Recently, microfluidic engineering enables more efficient
separation in a continuous flow with rapid processing of small volumes of rare
biological samples, such as DNA, proteins, viruses, exosomes, and even cells. In 
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances in
microfluidic separation of micro-/nano-sized bioparticles by summarizing the
physical principles behind the separation system and practical examples of
biomedical applications.
