Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and substantial health
concerns. Infection may result in mild to severe respiratory disease associated
with morbidity and some mortality. Several anti-influenza drugs are available,
but these agents target viral components and are susceptible to drug resistance. 
There is a need for new antiviral drug strategies that include repurposing of
clinically approved drugs. Drugs that target cellular machinery necessary for
influenza virus replication can provide a means for inhibiting influenza virus
replication. We used RNA interference screening to identify key host cell genes
required for influenza replication, and then FDA-approved drugs that could be
repurposed for targeting host genes. We examined the effects of Clopidogrel and
Triamterene to inhibit A/WSN/33 (EC50 5.84 uM and 31.48 uM, respectively),
A/CA/04/09 (EC50 6.432 uM and 3.32 uM, respectively), and B/Yamagata/16/1988
(EC50 0.28 uM and 0.11 uM, respectively) replication. Clopidogrel and Triamterene
provide a druggable approach to influenza treatment across multiple strains and
subtypes.
