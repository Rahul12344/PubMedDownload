BACKGROUND: Older adults are given high priority for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) vaccination; however, little is known about the safety of vaccines.
This study was conducted to examine the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine for people
who were ≥ 75 years of age, specifically those who first took two doses of the
vaccine at the COVID-19 central vaccination center in South Korea.
METHODS: Safety monitoring after the BNT162b2 vaccine was conducted in three ways
for older adults who received the first dose of the vaccine at our center between
April 5 and April 23, 2021. For immediate adverse reactions, every person who was
vaccinated was observed for 15-30 minutes after injection at the center. For
active surveillance, a telephone interview was conducted for stratified randomly 
sampled people after 7 days of each vaccination to enquire regarding types of
adverse reactions they experienced, and its severity and duration. For passive
surveillance, reported adverse event data were collected from the COVID-19
vaccine adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system-run by
the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The data were then
reviewed.
RESULTS: In total, 2,123 older adults received at least one vaccine dose during
the study period. The frequency of acute adverse reactions that developed during 
the observed 15-30 minutes after injection was 8.5 cases per 1,000 doses. None of
the reactions was assessed as acute allergic reactions to the vaccine and no
cases required special treatment or drug administration. Overall, 638 people were
followed up at least once by telephone interview 7 days post vaccination. The
overall response rate was 82.3%. The rates of local reactions were 50.3% after
the first dose and 45.2% after the second dose, and the rates of systemic
reactions were 15.2% and 26.0%, respectively. During the study period, 23
medically attended adverse events (5.4 cases per 1,000 administered doses) were
reported to the KDCA AEFI surveillance system. The most common symptoms of
medically attended cases were nonspecific general weakness (26%) and dizziness
(26%), followed by muscle pain (22%), headache (13%), fever (13%), and skin rash 
or urticaria (13%). Among them, there were five serious adverse events reported, 
which required hospitalization, including one death. However, most of them were
not related to the vaccines.
CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 vaccination was tolerable among adults who were ≥ 75 years
of age.
