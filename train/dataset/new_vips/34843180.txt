BACKGROUND: When the periods of time during and after the first wave of the
ongoing SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Europe are compared, the associated
COVID-19 mortality seems to have decreased substantially. Various factors could
explain this trend, including changes in demographic characteristics of infected 
persons and the improvement of case management. To date, no study has been
performed to investigate the evolution of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in
Switzerland, while also accounting for risk factors.
METHODS: We investigated the trends in COVID-19-related mortality (in-hospital
and in-intermediate/intensive-care) over time in Switzerland, from February 2020 
to June 2021, comparing in particular the first and the second wave. We used data
from the COVID-19 Hospital-based Surveillance (CH-SUR) database. We performed
survival analyses adjusting for well-known risk factors of COVID-19 mortality
(age, sex and comorbidities) and accounting for competing risk.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 16,984 patients recorded in CH-SUR, with 2201
reported deaths due to COVID-19 (13.0%). We found that overall in-hospital
mortality was lower during the second wave of COVID-19 than in the first wave
(hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63- 0.78; p <0.001), a
decrease apparently not explained by changes in demographic characteristics of
patients. In contrast, mortality in intermediate and intensive care significantly
increased in the second wave compared with the first wave (HR 1.25, 95% CI
1.05-1.49; p = 0.029), with significant changes in the course of hospitalisation 
between the first and the second wave.
CONCLUSION: We found that, in Switzerland, COVID-19 mortality decreased among
hospitalised persons, whereas it increased among patients admitted to
intermediate or intensive care, when comparing the second wave to the first wave.
We put our findings in perspective with changes over time in case management,
treatment strategy, hospital burden and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further
analyses of the potential effect of virus variants and of vaccination on
mortality would be crucial to have a complete overview of COVID-19 mortality
trends throughout the different phases of the pandemic.
