Mink, on a farm with about 15,000 animals, became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Over 
75% of tested animals were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and 100%
of tested animals were seropositive. The virus responsible had a deletion of
nucleotides encoding residues H69 and V70 within the spike protein gene as well
as the A22920T mutation, resulting in the Y453F substitution within this protein,
seen previously in mink. The infected mink recovered and after free-testing of
300 mink (a level giving 93% confidence of detecting a 1% prevalence), the
animals remained seropositive. During further follow-up studies, after a period
of more than 2 months without any virus detection, over 75% of tested animals
again scored positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Whole genome sequencing showed that the
viruses circulating during this re-infection were most closely related to those
identified in the first outbreak on this farm but additional sequence changes had
occurred. Animals had much higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum
samples after the second round of infection than at free-testing or during
recovery from initial infection, consistent with a boosted immune response. Thus,
it was concluded that following recovery from an initial infection, seropositive 
mink were readily re-infected by SARS-CoV-2.
