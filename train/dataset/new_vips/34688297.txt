BACKGROUND: The public health crises that emerged in the COVID-19 pandemic
significantly impacted the provision of medical care and placed sudden
restrictions on ongoing clinical research. Patient-facing clinical research
confronted unique challenges in which recruitment and study protocols were halted
and then adapted to meet safety procedures during the pandemic. Our study
protocol included the use of a Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool (LCSDecTool)
in the context of a primary care visit and was considerably impacted by the
pandemic. We describe our experience adapting a multi-site clinical trial of the 
LCSDecTool within the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System. We
conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the LCSDecTool to a
control intervention. Outcomes included lung cancer screening (LCS) knowledge,
shared decision-making, and uptake and adherence to LCS protocol. We identified
three strategies that led to the successful adaptation of the study design during
the pandemic: (1) multi-level coordination and communication across the
organization and study sites, (2) flexibility and adaptability in research during
a time of uncertainty and changes in regulation, and (3) leveraging technology to
deliver the intervention and conduct study visits, which raised issues concerning
equity and internal and external validity.
CONCLUSION: Our experience highlights strategies successfully employed to adapt
an intervention and behavioral research study protocol during the COVID-19
pandemic. This experience will inform clinical research moving forward both
during and subsequent to the constraints placed on research and clinical care
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
