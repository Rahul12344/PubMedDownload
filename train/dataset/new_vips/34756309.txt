BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immunosuppression is a known risk factor for cervical 
cancer. Women with rheumatic conditions are immunosuppressed due to the disease
and the treatments. One of the main risk factors for this neoplasm is the lack of
adherence to early detection programmes for human papillomavirus. The objectives 
of this study were to evaluate the adherence to the screening programme of
patients in the Rheumatology Clinic, as well as to evaluate the prevalence of
cervical lesions and their association with the different disease characteristics
and the treatments received.
METHODS: A descriptive retrospective study. The electronic medical history of
patients actively being followed up in a tertiary hospital with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PSA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
were reviewed.
RESULTS: Finally, 307 patients were included. No data were found for screening
programme attendance in up to 42.4% of the patients (39.6% in RA, 43.8% in PSA
and 46% in SLE). Among the patients who attended the screening programme at least
once (57.6%), the prevalence of cervical dysplasia was 5.1%. No cases of
neoplasia were found. In the simple logistic regression analysis, there was no
association between attending the screening programme and any variable. The study
also showed no association between the variables collected and the presence of
infection and dysplasia.
CONCLUSION: These results are influenced by the absence of screening data in a
significant percentage of patients and by the low prevalence of dysplasia found
in this series of patients with rheumatic diseases.
