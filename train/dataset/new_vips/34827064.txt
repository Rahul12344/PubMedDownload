HCV is a virus that can cause chronic infection which can result in a systemic
disease that may include many rheumatologic manifestations such as arthritis,
myalgia, sicca syndrome, cryoglobulinemia vasculitis as well as other
non-rheumatological disorders (renal failure, onco-haematological malignancies). 
In this population, the high frequency of rheumatoid factor (45-70%), antinuclear
(10-40%) and anticardiolipin (15-20%) antibodies is a B-cell mediated finding
sustained by the infection. However, the possibility that a primitive rheumatic
pathology may coexist with the HCV infection is not to be excluded thus
complicating a differential diagnosis between primitive and HCV-related
disorders.
