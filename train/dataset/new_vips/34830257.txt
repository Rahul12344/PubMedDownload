To investigate the antiviral effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on the replication
of Marek's disease virus (MDV) in chicken embryonic fibroblast (CEF) cells,
real-time PCR, Western blotting, plaque counting, and indirect immunofluorescence
experiments were performed at different time points of LiCl treated CEF cells
with virus infection. The results demonstrated that LiCl could affect multiple
steps of virus replication and inhibit viral gene expression and protein
synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, LiCl could directly
affect viral infectivity as well. In addition, LiCl significantly affected the
gene expression of IFN-Î² related genes in virus-infected cells. These results
indicate that LiCl significantly inhibits MDV replication and proliferation in
CEF cells and it has the potential to be used as an antiviral agent against MDV.
