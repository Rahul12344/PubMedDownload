BACKGROUND: Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of stomach is extremely rare.
The pathogenesis of SCC of stomach remains unclear. There is only one report that
Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of SCC
arising in the stomach ever before. Here, we report a case of Epstein Barr virus 
infection-associated primary SCC of stomach in a 70-year-old woman. She was
presented to the referring hospital with hematemesis. Initial endoscopy revealed 
a bleeding gastric ulcer in the upper part of gastric corpus and the coagulation 
therapy was followed. After a 3-month follow-up, endoscopy revealed a submucosal 
tumor-like protrusion instead of an ulcer. Computed tomography revealed a mass in
the upper part of stomach and swollen lymph nodes along with the lesser curvature
and para-aortic lymph node. Biopsy could not confirm the definitive diagnosis. We
performed total gastrectomy with para-aortic lymph node sampling. Histological
analysis revealed squamous cell carcinoma with EBV infection with lymph node
metastases. Tumor cells were positive for EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) by in situ
hybridization. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was
discharged on day 11 after the operation. CapeOX was started as adjuvant
chemotherapy, and the patient remains alive without recurrence 7 months after
surgery.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of EBV infection-associated primary SCC
of the stomach diagnosed by in situ hybridization of EBER. EBV infection may be
related to the pathogenesis of primary SCC. Further evidence and studies are
required to establish optimal strategy for this rare disease.
