COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019. As long as this type of
coronavirus was new, the main way for governments to avoid the spread of the
infection was enforced quarantine. Besides public health protection, quarantine
can have a psychological impact on the residents, with main symptoms being angst,
anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms. As it has been found that character
strengths can promote subjective wellbeing, the purpose of the study was to
examine this relationship under the new situation of quarantine in the Greek
population in adults who were in quarantine for at least two weeks. The total
sample consisted of 354 participants who were aged 18-72-years-old. A total of
263 participants were women (74.3%), 91 were men (25.7%), and 94.6% of them were 
highly educated. The sample was a convenience sample. The tools used were PANAS, 
PERMA and finally VIA-114GR. The data analysis was completed using SPSS software 
version 26.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2019. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version
26.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp) and EQS 6.1 (Multivariate Software Inc.: Encino,
CA, USA, 2006). The results showed that love, curiosity, persistence, hope, and
zest are strongly associated with subjective wellbeing, even in conditions such
as quarantine, and can support specific aspects of it.
