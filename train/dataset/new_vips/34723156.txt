We used the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein in the prefusion
conformation to immunize horses for the production of hyperimmune globulins
against SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibody titers measured by ELISA were above 1:106, and
the neutralizing antibody titer against authentic virus (WT) was 1:14,604
(average PRNT90). Plasma from immunized animals was pepsin digested to remove the
Fc portion and purified, yielding an F(ab')2 preparation with PRNT90 titers
150-fold higher than the neutralizing titers in human convalescent plasma.
Challenge studies were carried out in hamsters and showed the in vivo ability of 
equine F(ab')2 to reduce viral load in the pulmonary tissues and significant
clinical improvement determined by weight gain. The neutralization curve by
F(ab')2 was similar against the WT and P.2 variants, but displaced to higher
concentrations by 0.39 log units against the P.1 (Gamma) variant. These results
support the possibility of using equine F(ab')2 preparation for the clinical
treatment of COVID patients.
