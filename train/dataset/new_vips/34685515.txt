Eukaryotic cells contain dynamic membrane-bound organelles that are constantly
remodeled in response to physiological and environmental cues. Key organelles are
the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, which are
interconnected by vesicular traffic through the secretory transport route.
Numerous viruses, especially enveloped viruses, use and modify compartments of
the secretory pathway to promote their replication, assembly and cell egression
by hijacking the host cell machinery. In some cases, the subversion mechanism has
been uncovered. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how the
secretory pathway is subverted and exploited by viruses belonging to
Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Poxviridae, Parvoviridae and
Herpesviridae families.
