The evolution of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
variants around the globe has made the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic more worrisome, pressuring the health care system and resulting in an
increased mortality rate. Recent studies recognized neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a key 
facilitator in the invasion of the new SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Therefore, 
it is considered an imperative drug target for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, 
a thorough analysis was needed to understand the impact and to guide new
therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular
simulation techniques to identify novel marine natural products which could block
this receptor and stop the virus entry. We discovered that the binding affinity
of CMNPD10175, CMNPD10017, CMNPD10114, CMNPD10115, CMNPD10020. CMNPD10018,
CMNPD10153, CMNPD10149 CMNPD10464 and CMNPD10019 were substantial during the
virtual screening (VS). We further explored these compounds by analyzing their
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicity (ADMET)
properties and structural-dynamics features. Free energy calculations further
established that all the compounds exhibit stronger binding energy for NRP1.
Consequently, we hypothesized that these compounds might be the best lead
candidates for therapeutic interventions hindering virus binding to the host
cell. This study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the
SARS-CoV-2 by targeting NRP1.
