TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) not only recruits TBK1/IKKε to MAVS upon virus
infection but also catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination on substrate or
itself, which is critical for NEMO-dependent and -independent TBK1/IKKε
activation, leading to the production of type I IFNs. The regulation at the TRAF6
level could affect the activation of antiviral innate immunity. In this study, we
demonstrate that zebrafish prmt2, a type I arginine methyltransferase, attenuates
traf6-mediated antiviral response. Prmt2 binds to the C terminus of traf6 to
catalyze arginine asymmetric dimethylation of traf6 at arginine 100, preventing
its K63-linked autoubiquitination, which results in the suppression of traf6
activation. In addition, it seems that the N terminus of prmt2 competes with mavs
for traf6 binding and prevents the recruitment of tbk1/ikkε to mavs. By zebrafish
model, we show that loss of prmt2 promotes the survival ratio of zebrafish larvae
after challenge with spring viremia of carp virus. Therefore, we reveal, to our
knowledge, a novel function of prmt2 in the negative regulation of antiviral
innate immunity by targeting traf6.
