BACKGROUND: Western medicine mainly uses antiviral drugs to treat influenza.
However, anti-influenza virus drugs have been reported to have high levels of
drug resistance and varying degrees of adverse reactions. In addition, Western
medicine uses vaccination to prevent influenza, but vaccination cannot ensure
complete prevention. Vaccines have a certain lag and cannot prevent the
constantly mutating influenza virus. At present, there are still certain
limitations in the prevention of influenza. In recent years, traditional Chinese 
medicine has been used more and more widely in the prevention and treatment of
influenza and improvement of influenza-like symptoms, and related clinical
efficacy control studies have reached a certain number. Therefore, the purpose of
this study is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese patent
medicine in the treatment of influenza.
METHODS: Computer search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wangfang and 
VIP database, search for randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicines
therapy on influenza, the search time limit is to build the database until
October 2021. Two researchers screened the retrieved literature and collected
relevant patient information and data. The final included literature was meta
analyzed by Rev man5.4 software.
RESULTS: The effectiveness and safety of Chinese patent medicines in the
treatment of patients with influenza will be systematically evaluated.
CONCLUSION: Systematic collection and analysis of clinical randomized controlled 
trials of Chinese patent medicines for the treatment of influenza, with a view to
providing basic information for clinical decision-making and related research.
