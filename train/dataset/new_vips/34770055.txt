OBJECTIVES: To analyze the role of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, to
measure pharmacists' attitude toward COVID-19 safety measures (wearing masks,
wearing gloves, isolation shield, good hygiene, etc.), and explore their
perspectives regarding a second wave of the virus.
METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during 
the COVID-19 outbreak in July 2020 to discuss Jordanian pharmacists' awareness of
safety at their workplace during the COVID-19 outbreak, their sources of
information, and their predictions for COVID-19 vaccination.
RESULTS: The participants (n = 311) were all pharmacists mostly aged between
23-30 years old (45%) and female (83%). The primary source of information about
COVID-19 was social networking (38.9%). Pharmacists were committed to social
distancing (86.5%) and wearing masks (76.2%). They expressed levels of agreement 
to their role in decreasing COVID-19 spread (94.2%) and correcting false
information (94.5%); they expressed levels of expectation toward concern about a 
second COVID-19 wave (83%) that would be more severe than the previous one
(43.4%). Pharmacists expected that an influenza vaccine might be helpful in
decreasing severity and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (56.9%). Pharmacists
expected COVID-19 vaccine development within 6 months of administering our study 
survey (84.9%) and that vaccination might be effective in preventing COVID-19
(93%) infection.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacists expressed positive roles on COVID-19 spread through
exemplary actions, self-commitment to protection measures, and public health
awareness. Social media as a source of health information should be cautiously
investigated, and pharmacists should always refer to evidence-based sources. The 
role of pharmacists is particularly important for the upcoming era of COVID-19
vaccination administration and awareness.
