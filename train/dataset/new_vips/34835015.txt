Men are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19),
and face higher odds of severe illness and death compared to women. The vascular 
effects of androgen signaling and inflammatory cytokines in severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated endothelial injury are
not defined. We determined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated
endothelial injury under conditions of exposure to androgen dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α) and tested potentially therapeutic
effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism by spironolactone. Circulating
endothelial injury markers VCAM-1 and E-selectin were measured in men and women
diagnosed with COVID-19. Exposure of endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro to DHT
exacerbated spike protein S1-mediated endothelial injury transcripts for the cell
adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and anti-fibrinolytic PAI-1 (p <
0.05), and increased THP-1 monocyte adhesion to ECs (p = 0.032). Spironolactone
dramatically reduced DHT+S1-induced endothelial activation. TNF-α exacerbated
S1-induced EC activation, which was abrogated by pretreatment with
spironolactone. Analysis from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 showed
concordant higher circulating VCAM-1 and E-Selectin levels in men, compared to
women. A beneficial effect of the FDA-approved drug spironolactone was observed
on endothelial cells in vitro, supporting a rationale for further evaluation of
mineralocorticoid antagonism as an adjunct treatment in COVID-19.
