INTRODUCTION: Mortality rates associated with COVID-19 vary widely between
countries and, within countries, between regions. These differences might be
explained by population susceptibility, environmental factors, transmission
dynamics, containment strategies, and diagnostic approaches. We aimed to analyze 
if obesity and diabetes prevalence are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality 
rates in Mexico.
METHODOLOGY: We analyzed the mortality rate for each of the 2,457 municipalities 
in Mexico, one of the countries with highest COVID-19 mortality rate, during the 
first seven months of the pandemic to identify factors associated with higher
mortality, including demographic, health-related characteristics (prevalence of
obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in adults older than 20 years old), and
altitude.
RESULTS: During the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic there were 85,666
deaths reported in Mexico, with a cumulative mortality rate of 67 per 100,000
population. The mean mortality rate for the 2,457 municipalities in Mexico was
33.9 per 100,000 population. At a municipal level, the prevalence of diabetes and
obesity, as well as high human development index, and location at < 500 or > 2000
above sea level were associated with higher mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated obesity and diabetes prevalence explain, in part, high
COVID-19 mortality rates registered in certain municipalities in Mexico. These
results suggest that a regionalized approach should be considered to successfully
limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2.
