At Wuhan, in December 2019, the SRAS-CoV-2 outbreak was detected and it has been 
the pandemic worldwide. This study aims to investigate the mutations in sequence 
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterize the mutation patterns in Egyptian
COVID-19 patients during different waves of infection. The samples were collected
from 250 COVID-19 patients and the whole genome sequencing was conducted using
Next Generation Sequencing. The viral sequence analysis showed 1115 different
genome from all Egyptian samples in the second wave mutations including 613
missense mutations, 431 synonymous mutations, 25 upstream gene mutations, 24
downstream gene mutations, 10 frame-shift deletions, and 6 stop gained mutation. 
The Egyptian genomic strains sequenced in second wave of infection are different 
to that of the first wave. We observe a shift of lineage prevalence from the
strain B.1 to B.1.1.1. Only one case was of the new English B.1.1.7. Few samples 
have one or two mutations of interest from the Brazil and South Africa isolates. 
New clade 20B appear by March 2020 and 20D appear by May 2020 till January 2021.
