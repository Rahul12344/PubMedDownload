Neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies against the spike protein of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) play a significant role
both in the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
In this review we discuss the monoclonal antibody therapies that have received
preliminary authorization for use in COVID-19 patients by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration or the European Medicines Agency. We review here their mechanisms 
of action, their efficacy in prophylaxis and treatment, their indications for
use, and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on their activity.
