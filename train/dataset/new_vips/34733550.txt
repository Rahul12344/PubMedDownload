Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses infecting humans 
and animals, causing a multitude of symptoms. COVID-19 is not only known to
affect the respiratory system, but shows unusual gastrointestinal complications. 
Pancreatitis can be caused by biliary stones, alcohol abuse, viruses, drug
intake, metabolic syndromes, or trauma. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 
any two of the three criteria: acute onset of severe upper abdominal pain,
consistent with pancreatitis; elevation of serum amylase or lipase, three times
the upper limit of normal; and/or characteristic imaging findings. COVID-19
associated pancreatitis is thought to be mediated by the angiotensin-converting
enzyme-2 receptor on the host cells, which are highly expressed in the pancreatic
cells. Here, we report a unique case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis caused by 
COVID-19 with hyperglycemia and normal amylase and lipase levels.
