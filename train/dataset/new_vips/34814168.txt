In the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns exist that ventilator triage policies may lead
to discrimination against people with disabilities. This study evaluates whether 
preclinical medical students demonstrate bias towards people with disabilities
during an educational ventilator-allocation exercise. Written student responses
to a triage simulation activity were analyzed to describe ventilator priority
rankings and to identify themes regarding disability. Disability status was not
cited as a reason to withhold a ventilator. Key themes observed in ventilator
triage decisions included life expectancy, comorbidities, and social worth.
Although disability discrimination has historically been perpetuated by health
care professionals, it is encouraging that preclinical medical students did not
demonstrate explicit bias against people with disabilities in ventilator triage
scenarios.
