Vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can occur in utero,
during delivery, and through breastfeeding. We utilized Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) imaging coupled with fluorescent microscopy of 64Cu-labeled
photoactivatable-GFP-HIV (PA-GFP-BaL) to determine how HIV virions distribute and
localize in neonatal rhesus macaques two and four hours after oral viral
challenge. Our results show that by four hours after oral viral exposure, HIV
virions localize to and penetrate the rectal mucosa. We also used a dual viral
challenge with a non-replicative viral vector and a replication competent
SHIV-1157ipd3N4 to examine viral transduction and dissemination at 96 hours. Our 
data show that while SHIV-1157ipd3N4 infection can be found in the oral cavity
and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the small and large intestine contained
the largest number of infected cells. Moreover, we found that T cells were the
biggest population of infected immune cells. Thus, thanks to these novel
technologies, we are able to visualize and delineate of viral distribution and
infection throughout the entire neonatal GI tract during acute viral infection.
