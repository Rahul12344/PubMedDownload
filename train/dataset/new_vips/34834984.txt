We aimed to explore whether variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Chinese-derived strain (D614,
lineage A), Italian strain PV10734 (D614G, lineage B.1.1) and Alpha strain
(lineage B.1.1.7)) were able to infect monocytes (MN) and monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDM) and whether these infected cells may, in turn, be vectors of
infection. For this purpose, we designed an in vitro study following the
evolution of MN and MDM infection at different time points in order to confirm
whether these cells were permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally, we
investigated whether, regardless of viral replication, the persistent virus can
be transferred to non-infected cells permissive for viral replication. Thus, we
co-cultured the infected MN/MDM with permissive VERO E6 cells verifying the viral
transmission. This is a further in vitro demonstration of the important role of
MN and MDM in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and evolution of the COVID-19
disease.
