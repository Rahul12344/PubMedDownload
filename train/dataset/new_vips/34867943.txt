Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger uncontrolled innate and adaptive immune
responses, which are commonly associated with lymphopenia and increased
neutrophil counts. However, whether the immune abnormalities observed in mild to 
severely infected patients persist into convalescence remains unclear. Herein,
comparisons were drawn between the immune responses of COVID-19 infected and
convalescent adults. Strikingly, survivors of severe COVID-19 had decreased
proportions of NKT and Vδ2 T cells, and increased proportions of low-density
neutrophils, IgA+/CD86+/CD123+ non-classical monocytes and hyperactivated
HLADR+CD38+ CD8+ T cells, and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such 
as hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor A, long after 
virus clearance. Our study suggests potential immune correlates of "long
COVID-19", and defines key cells and cytokines that delineate true and
quasi-convalescent states.
