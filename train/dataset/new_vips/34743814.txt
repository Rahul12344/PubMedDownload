Thrombotic complication has been an important symptom in critically ill patients 
with COVID-19. It has not been clear whether the virus spike (S) protein can
directly induce blood coagulation in addition to inflammation. Heparan sulfate
(HS)/heparin, a key factor in coagulation process, was found to bind SARS-CoV-2 S
protein with high affinity. Herein, we found that the S protein can competitively
inhibit the bindings of antithrombin and heparin cofactor II to heparin/HS,
causing abnormal increase in thrombin activity. SARS-CoV-2 S protein at a similar
concentration (~10 μg/mL) as the viral load in critically ill patients can cause 
directly blood coagulation and thrombosis in zebrafish model. Furthermore,
exogenous heparin/HS can significantly reduce coagulation caused by S protein,
pointing to a potential new direction to elucidate the etiology of the virus and 
provide fundamental support for anticoagulant therapy especially for the COVID-19
critically ill patients.
