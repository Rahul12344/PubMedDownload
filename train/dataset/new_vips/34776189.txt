INTRODUCTION: A series of atypical acute respiratory diseases were caused in
Wuhan, China, in December 2019 by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Over six
million confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported worldwide, and total deaths in
the USA from March 1 to May 30, 2020, were approximately 7,81,000. Worldwide,
scientists are developing many potential COVID-19 vaccines. Few of the companies 
got success in the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, but most of the
recipients reported injection site reactions like pain, redness, or erythema
after vaccination. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of gentle upper
limb exercises to reduce injection site reactions, and here we present a case
with post vaccination site reaction that reported pre-assessment score 7 for
visual analog scale for pain and score 2 for redness and erythema with
Investigator-reported and rated injection site reactions. Then he performed
gentle upper limb exercises after 8 and 24 hours of vaccination.
RESULT: The study reported a beneficial effect of these exercises to reduce pain 
and redness or erythema after Covid-19 vaccination.
DISCUSSION: The potential benefit of gentle exercises may be due to their blood
flow boost-up and anti-inflammatory effects. However, high-quality controlled
trials are warranted further to evaluate the potential benefit of upper limb
gentle exercises for the reduction of injection site reactions after the Covid-19
vaccination injection.
CONCLUSION: The clinical experience with the subect shows that gentle exercises
for upper limb may reduce the inection site reaction after COVID-19 vaccination.
