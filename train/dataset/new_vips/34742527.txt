As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear, it was evident that higher
education schools and Universities, including schools of nursing were facing
enormous challenges to create a safe environment for educational instruction to
continue. Clinical education in particular was affected as clinical sites were
increasingly unable to accommodate student clinical rotations due to crushing
volumes and overwhelming care needs of COVID patients. This article outlines the 
innovative efforts of one university that set up a robust surveillance testing
program that required and provided weekly COVID-19 testing of all students,
faculty and staff that were on-campus. The testing center is nurse led and nurse 
managed, providing a clinical experience for over 50 nursing students each
semester, allowing them to accrue community clinical hours so that they can
progress through their nursing program. Clinical quality and patient experience
outcomes are shared, and lessons learned described.
