The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life as usual around the globe. Efforts to
control the spread of the virus with lockdowns and border closures pushed
millions of people into food and social insecurity. Most research on humanitarian
organizations have been dominated by the uncertainty and urgency of disaster
response operations. However, some humanitarian organizations also operate in
long-term continuous aid programs where efficiency is the key goal. We analyzed
the operations of food banks in the Feeding America network and The Salvation
Army USA, and found them to be ambidextrous organizations. The ambidextrous
humanitarian organizations like food banks and Salvation Army, focus on long-term
continuous aid programs, specifically pertaining to the sustenance of the
communities they serve, but also play a key part as first responders or as local 
agencies aiding in disaster relief and response. We propose a framework to
analyze disaster, development, and sustenance aid supply chains, and identify
future research opportunities.
