About 4% of the population in Taiwan are seropositive for anti-HCV Ab and 70%
with HCV RNA. To address this high chronic hepatitis C disease load, Taiwan
National Health Insurance started reimbursing genotype-specific DAAs in 2017 and 
pangenotype DAAs in mid-2018. With a 97% SVR12 rate, there were still 2-3% of
patients that failed to clear HCV. To understand the causes of DAA failure in
Taiwan, we conducted a multi-center, clinical, and virologic study. A total of
147 DAA-failure patients were recruited, and we searched HCV NS3/4A, NS5A and
NS5B for known resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) by population
sequencing, and conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) for those without known
RASs. A total of 107 patients received genotype-specific DAAs while 40 had
pangenotype DAAs. Clinically, the important cause of failure is poor adherence.
Virologically, common RASs in genotype-specific DAAs were NS5A-L31, NS5A-Y93, and
NS5B-C316, while common RASs in pangenotype DAAs were NS5A-L31, NS5A-A/Q/R30, and
NS5A-Y93. Additionally, new amino acid changes were found by WGS. Finally, we
identified 12 cases with inconsistent baseline and post-treatment HCV genotypes, 
which is suggestive of re-infection rather than treatment failure. Our study
described the drug resistance profile for DAA failure in Taiwan, showing
differences from other countries.
