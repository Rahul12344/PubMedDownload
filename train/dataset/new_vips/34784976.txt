BACKGROUND: Clinical metagenomics (CMg) has the potential to be translated from a
research tool into routine service to improve antimicrobial treatment and
infection control decisions. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides added impetus to
realise these benefits, given the increased risk of secondary infection and
nosocomial transmission of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens linked with the
expansion of critical care capacity.
METHODS: CMg using nanopore sequencing was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study 
on 43 respiratory samples from 34 intubated patients across seven intensive care 
units (ICUs) over a 9-week period during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave.
RESULTS: An 8-h CMg workflow was 92% sensitive (95% CI, 75-99%) and 82% specific 
(95% CI, 57-96%) for bacterial identification based on culture-positive and
culture-negative samples, respectively. CMg sequencing reported the presence or
absence of β-lactam-resistant genes carried by Enterobacterales that would modify
the initial guideline-recommended antibiotics in every case. CMg was also 100%
concordant with quantitative PCR for detecting Aspergillus fumigatus from 4
positive and 39 negative samples. Molecular typing using 24-h sequencing data
identified an MDR-K. pneumoniae ST307 outbreak involving 4 patients and an MDR-C.
striatum outbreak involving 14 patients across three ICUs.
CONCLUSION: CMg testing provides accurate pathogen detection and antibiotic
resistance prediction in a same-day laboratory workflow, with assembled genomes
available the next day for genomic surveillance. The provision of this technology
in a service setting could fundamentally change the multi-disciplinary team
approach to managing ICU infections. The potential to improve the initial
targeted treatment and rapidly detect unsuspected outbreaks of MDR-pathogens
justifies further expedited clinical assessment of CMg.
