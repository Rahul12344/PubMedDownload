Diabetes is a major contributor to the increasing burden of heart failure
prevalence globally, at least in part due to a disease process termed diabetic
cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterised by cardiac structural
changes that are caused by chronic exposure to the diabetic milieu. These
structural changes are a major cause of left ventricular (LV) wall stiffness and 
the development of LV dysfunction. In the current study, we investigated the
therapeutic potential of a cardiac-targeted bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7)
gene therapy, administered once diastolic dysfunction was present, mimicking the 
timeframe in which clinical management of the cardiomyopathy would likely be
desired. Following 18 weeks of untreated diabetes, mice were administered with a 
single tail-vein injection of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (AAV),
containing the BMP7 gene, or null vector. Our data demonstrated, after 8 weeks of
treatment, that rAAV6-BMP7 treatment exerted beneficial effects on LV functional 
and structural changes. Importantly, diabetes-induced LV dysfunction was
significantly attenuated by a single administration of rAAV6-BMP7. This was
associated with a reduction in cardiac fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and
cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, BMP7 gene therapy limited pathological
remodelling in the diabetic heart, conferring an improvement in cardiac function.
These findings provide insight for the potential development of treatment
strategies urgently needed to delay or reverse LV pathological remodelling in the
diabetic heart.
