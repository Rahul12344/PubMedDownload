Objective: Alternative medicine plays an important role today in searching for
therapeutics for cancer and viral infection. So, a scientific validation to
characterize constituents in the alternative medicines and therapeutic testing is
warranted using modern instrumentation.
Methods: In the present study, an old herbomineral formulation, KanthaRasavillai 
[KRV], was characterized using UV-vis spectrometry, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and TEM
study. Also, In vitro and in vivo studies were done to evaluate their antiviral
and anticancer activity. FT-IR and XRD studies revealed a cocktail of
nanoparticles of mercury, magnetic oxide, cinnabar, and arsenic.ResultsBased on
SEM, TEM, and XRD report, KRV contains nanoparticles in the size range of 9.1nm
to 25.0 nm. FT-IR analysis exposed the presence of several anti-cancerous
bioactive compounds.Further in vitro testing against HCV virus proved KRV to
inhibit HCV virus a close relative to SARS-CoV-2. MTT assay confirmed the
anticancer effect of KRV against Huh-7 and MCF-7 cell lines.
Conclusion: The anticancer and antiviral properties in the ancient herbomineral
drug with a cocktail of metal nanoparticles acknowledge the traditional medical
practice as a pioneering approach for present-day ailments. However, the study
concludes that the use of KRV depends on safety dosage and genuine preparation as
described by ancient saints.
