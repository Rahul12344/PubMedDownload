Individuals suffering from severe viral respiratory tract infections have
recently emerged as "at risk" groups for developing invasive fungal infections.
Influenza virus is one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory tract
infections worldwide. Fungal infections complicating influenza pneumonia are
associated with increased disease severity and mortality, with invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis being the most common manifestation. Strikingly, similar
observations have been made during the current coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. The copathogenesis of respiratory viral and fungal
coinfections is complex and involves a dynamic interplay between the host immune 
defenses and the virulence of the microbes involved that often results in failure
to return to homeostasis. In this review, we discuss the main mechanisms
underlying susceptibility to invasive fungal disease following respiratory viral 
infections. A comprehensive understanding of these interactions will aid the
development of therapeutic modalities against newly identified targets to prevent
and treat these emerging coinfections.
