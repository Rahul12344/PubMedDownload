OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic pressurised healthcare with increased shortage 
of care. This resulted in an increase of awareness for code status documentation 
(ie, whether limitations to specific life-sustaining treatments are in place),
both in the medical field and in public media. However, it is unknown whether the
increased awareness changed the prevalence and content of code status
documentation for COVID-19 patients. We aim to describe differences in code
status documentation between infectious patients before the pandemic and COVID-19
patients.
SETTING: University Medical Centre of Utrecht, a tertiary care teaching academic 
hospital in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1715 patients were included, 129 in the COVID-19 cohort 
(a cohort of COVID-19 patients, admitted from March 2020 to June 2020) and 1586
in the pre-COVID-19 cohort (a cohort of patients with (suspected) infections
admitted between September 2016 to September 2018).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We described frequency of code status
documentation, frequency of discussion of this code status with patient and/or
family, and content of code status.
RESULTS: Frequencies of code status documentation (69.8% vs 72.7%, respectively) 
and discussion (75.6% vs 73.3%, respectively) were similar in both cohorts. More 
patients in the COVID-19 cohort than in the before COVID-19 cohort had any
treatment limitation as opposed to full code (40% vs 25%). Within the treatment
limitations, 'no intensive care admission' (81% vs 51%) and 'no intubation' (69% 
vs 40%) were more frequently documented in the COVID-19 cohort. A smaller
difference was seen in 'other limitation' (17% vs 9%), while 'no resuscitation'
(96% vs 92%) was comparable between both periods.
CONCLUSION: We observed no difference in the frequency of code status
documentation or discussion in COVID-19 patients opposed to a pre-COVID-19
cohort. However, treatment limitations were more prevalent in patients with
COVID-19, especially 'no intubation' and 'no intensive care admission'.
