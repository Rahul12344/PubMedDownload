INTRODUCTION: The rapid increase in the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) 
on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states in Nigeria
led to overcrowding at clinics. Patients were devolved to receive ART refills
through five differentiated service delivery (DSD) models: fast-track (FT),
adolescent refill clubs (ARCs), community pharmacy ART refill programs (CPARPs), 
community ART refill clubs (CARCs) and community ART refill groups (CARGs)
designed to meet the needs of different groups of PLHIV. In the context of
COVID-19-related travel restrictions, out-of-facility models offered critical
mechanisms for continuity of treatment. We compared retention and viral
suppression among those devolved to DSD with those who continued standard care at
facilities.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients devolved to
DSD from January 2018 to December 2020. Bivariate analyses were conducted to
assess differences in retention and viral suppression by socio-demographic
characteristics. Kaplan-Meier assessed retention at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
Differences in proportions were compared using the chi-square test; a p-value of 
<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 40,800 PLHIV from 84 facilities received ART through the five
models: CARC (53%), FT (19.1%), ARC (12.1%), CPARP (10.4%) and CARG (5.4%).
Retention rates at 6 months exceeded 96% for all models compared to 94% among
those continuing standard care. Among those using DSD, retention rate at 12
months was higher among adults than children (97.8% vs. 96.7%, p = 0.04). No
significant sex differences in retention rates were found among those enrolled in
DSD. Viral suppression rates among PLHIV served through DSD were significantly
higher among adults than children (95.4% vs. 89.2%; p <0.01). Among adults, 95.4%
enrolled in DSD were virally suppressed compared to 91.8% of those in standard
care (p <0.01). For children, 89.2% enrolled in DSD were virally suppressed
compared to 83.2% in standard care (p <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: PLHIV receiving ART through DSD models had retention but higher
viral suppression rates compared to those receiving standard care. Expanding DSD 
during COVID-19 has helped ensure uninterrupted access to ART in Nigeria. Further
scale-up is warranted to decongest facilities and improve clinical outcomes.
