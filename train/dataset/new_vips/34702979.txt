Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a non-enveloped virus and causes substantial morbidity 
and mortality in ruminants such as sheep. Fashioning a receptor-binding protein
(VP2) and a membrane penetration protein (VP5) on the surface, BTV releases its
genome-containing core (VP3 and VP7) into the host cell cytosol after perforation
of the endosomal membrane. Unlike enveloped ones, the entry mechanisms of
non-enveloped viruses into host cells remain poorly understood. Here we applied
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and
structure-guided functional assays to characterize intermediate states of BTV
cell entry in endosomes. Four structures of BTV at the resolution range of
3.4-3.9 Å show the different stages of structural rearrangement of capsid
proteins on exposure to low pH, including conformational changes of VP5, stepwise
detachment of VP2 and a small shift of VP7. In detail, sensing of the low-pH
condition by the VP5 anchor domain triggers three major VP5 actions: projecting
the hidden dagger domain, converting a surface loop to a protonated β-hairpin
that anchors VP5 to the core and stepwise refolding of the unfurling domains into
a six-helix stalk. Cryo-electron tomography structures of BTV interacting with
liposomes show a length decrease of the VP5 stalk from 19.5 to 15.5 nm after its 
insertion into the membrane. Our structures, functional assays and
structure-guided mutagenesis experiments combined indicate that this stalk, along
with dagger domain and the WHXL motif, creates a single pore through the
endosomal membrane that enables the viral core to enter the cytosol. Our study
unveils the detailed mechanisms of BTV membrane penetration and showcases general
methods to study cell entry of other non-enveloped viruses.
