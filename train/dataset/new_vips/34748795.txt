DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) belongs to the
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and plays an essential role in
endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we characterized the potential role of the
Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) DDIT3 (tDDIT3) in viral
infections. The tDDIT3 protein is highly conserved and has a species-specific
insertion of the SQSS repeat upstream of the C-terminal basic-leucine zipper
(bZIP) domain. Phylogenetic analysis of DDIT3 protein sequences of tree shrew and
related mammals indicated a closer genetic affinity between tree shrew and
primates than between tree shrew and rodents. Three positively selected sites
(PSSs: Glu83, Pro93, and Ser172) were identified in tDDIT3 based on the
branch-site model. Expression analysis of tDDIT3 showed a constitutively
expressed level in different tissues and a significantly increased level in tree 
shrew cells upon herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and Newcastle disease virus 
(NDV) infections. Overexpression of tDDIT3 significantly increased the production
of HSV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in tree shrew primary renal cells
(TSPRCs), whereas tDDIT3 knockout in tree shrew stable cell line (TSR6 cells) had
an inhibitory effect on virus production. The enhanced effect on viral infection 
by tDDIT3 was not associated with the three PSSs. Mechanistically, tDDIT3
overexpression inhibited type I IFN signaling. tDDIT3 interacted with tMAVS
through CARD and PRR domains, but not with other immune-related factors such as
tMDA5, tSTING and tTBK1. Collectively, our results revealed tDDIT3 as a negative 
regulator for virus infection.
