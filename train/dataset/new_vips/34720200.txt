This study proposes a contrastive convolutional auto-encoder (contrastive CAE), a
combined architecture of an auto-encoder and contrastive loss, to identify
individuals with suspected COVID-19 infection using heart-rate data from
participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the ongoing RADAR-CNS mHealth
research project. Heart-rate data was remotely collected using a Fitbit
wristband. COVID-19 infection was either confirmed through a positive swab test, 
or inferred through a self-reported set of recognised symptoms of the virus. The 
contrastive CAE outperforms a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a 
long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a convolutional auto-encoder without
contrastive loss (CAE). On a test set of 19 participants with MS with reported
symptoms of COVID-19, each one paired with a participant with MS with no COVID-19
symptoms, the contrastive CAE achieves an unweighted average recall of 95.3 % , a
sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 90.6 % , an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.944, indicating a maximum
successful detection of symptoms in the given heart rate measurement period,
whilst at the same time keeping a low false alarm rate.
