Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) is an important crop in Spain. To date, only one
viral species, apple stem pitting virus (ASPV), has been detected in Spanish
loquat orchards. In this study, the presence of additional viruses infecting this
crop in Spain was investigated. RT-PCR and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of
symptomatic loquat plants led to first-time detection and characterization of
apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), also known as citrus tatter leaf virus (CTLV), 
and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) from Spain with description of nearly
complete genomic sequences. The frequency of ACLSV infection was the highest,
with over 30% of the samples testing positive and were also detected as
coinfections with ASGV and ASPV, although most of the samples infected were
symptomless. Studies on all the full-length sequences available in the databases 
were performed in order to establish the phylogenetic relationships of the
Spanish isolates of these two viral species. Moreover, apple hammerhead viroid
(AHVd) was also detected to infect loquat, the first host different from apple
reported for this viroid to date.
