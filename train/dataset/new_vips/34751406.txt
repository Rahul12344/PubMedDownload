The 2A protein of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) acts as a
switch to stimulate programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) during infection.
Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of TMEV 2A and define how it
recognises the stimulatory RNA element. We demonstrate a critical role for bases 
upstream of the originally predicted stem-loop, providing evidence for a
pseudoknot-like conformation and suggesting that the recognition of this
pseudoknot by beta-shell proteins is a conserved feature in cardioviruses.
Through examination of PRF in TMEV-infected cells by ribosome profiling, we
identify a series of ribosomal pauses around the site of PRF induced by the
2A-pseudoknot complex. Careful normalisation of ribosomal profiling data with a
2A knockout virus facilitated the identification, through disome analysis, of
ribosome stacking at the TMEV frameshifting signal. These experiments provide
unparalleled detail of the molecular mechanisms underpinning Theilovirus
protein-stimulated frameshifting.
