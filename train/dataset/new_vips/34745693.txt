What is known about this topic?: H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as a dominant avian
influenza virus (AIV) subtype in southern China. The increasing genetic diversity
and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry
industry and human health.
What is added by this report?: A total of 2 cases of H5N6 that occurred from
February 2021 to July 2021 in Guangxi, China were reported in this study.
Phylogenetic analysis of gene was constructed, and some mutations of HA gene, PB2
gene, PA gene, M1 gene, NS1 gene, the receptor-binding site were detected. The
evolutionary origins of the internal genes were different.
What are the implications for public health practice?: As a multi-source
reassortant virus, the H5N6 highly pathogenic AIV is continuously evolving. There
is an urgent need to strengthen the surveillance of drug-resistant strains and
novel variants.
