Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in humans since late 2019. Here, we 
investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs and cats during COVID-19 quarantine at 
private veterinary hospitals in Thailand. From April to May 2021, we detected
SARS-CoV-2 in three out of 35 dogs and one out of nine cats from four out of 17
households with confirmed COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from one
of the nasal, oral, rectal and environmental swabs of dog-A (15 years old, mixed 
breed, male dog), cat-B (1 year old, domestic shorthair, male cat), dog-C (2
years old, mixed breed, female dog) and dog-D (4 years old, Pomeranian, female
dog). The animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 4 to 30 days after pet 
owners were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. The animals consecutively tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for 4 to 10 days. One dog (dog-A) showed mild
clinical signs, while the other dogs and a cat remained asymptomatic during
quarantine at the hospitals. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies were
detected in both the dogs and cat by surrogate virus neutralization tests.
Phylogenetic and genomic mutation analyses of whole genome sequences of three
SARS-CoV-2 strains from the dogs and cat revealed SARS-CoV-2 of the Alpha variant
(B.1.1.7 lineage). Our findings are suggestive of human-to-animal transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19-positive households and contamination of viral RNA in the 
environment. Public awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pet dogs and cats in
close contact with COVID-19 patients should be raised.
