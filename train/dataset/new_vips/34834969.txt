Despite a surge of RNA virome sequencing in recent years, there are still many
RNA viruses to uncover-as indicated by the relevance of viral dark matter to RNA 
virome studies (i.e., putative viruses that do not match to taxonomically
identified viruses). This study explores a unique site, a high-rate algal pond
(HRAP), for culturing industrially microalgae, to elucidate new RNA viruses. The 
importance of viral-host interactions in aquatic systems are well documented, and
the ever-expanding microalgae industry is no exception. As the industry becomes a
more important source of sustainable plastic manufacturing, a producer of
cosmetic pigments and alternative protein sources, and a means of CO2 remediation
in the face of climate change, studying microalgal viruses becomes a vital
practice for proactive management of microalgae cultures at the industrial level.
This study provides evidence of RNA microalgal viruses persisting in a CO2
remediation pilot project HRAP and uncovers the diversity of the RNA virosphere
contained within it. Evidence shows that family Marnaviridae is cultured in the
basin, alongside other potential microalgal infecting viruses (e.g., family
Narnaviridae, family Totitiviridae, and family Yueviridae). Finally, we
demonstrate that the RNA viral diversity of the HRAP is temporally dynamic across
two successive culturing seasons.
