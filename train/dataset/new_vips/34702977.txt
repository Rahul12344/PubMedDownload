Understanding the evolutionary adaptations that enable avian influenza viruses to
transmit in mammalian hosts could allow better detection of zoonotic viruses with
pandemic potential. We applied ancestral sequence reconstruction to gain viruses 
representing different adaptive stages of the European avian-like (EA) H1N1 swine
influenza virus as it transitioned from avian to swine hosts since 1979.
Ancestral viruses representing the avian-like precursor virus and EA swine
influenza viruses from 1979-1983, 1984-1987 and 1988-1992 were reconstructed and 
characterized. Glycan-binding analyses showed stepwise changes in the
haemagglutinin receptor-binding specificity of the EA swine influenza
viruses-that is, from recognition of both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialosides to
recognition of α2,6-linked sialosides only; however, efficient transmission in
piglets was enabled by adaptive changes in the viral polymerase protein and
nucleoprotein, which have been fixed since 1983. PB1-Q621R and NP-R351K increased
viral replication and transmission in piglets when introduced into the 1979-1983 
ancestral virus that lacked efficient transmissibility. The stepwise adaptation
of an avian influenza virus to a mammalian host suggests that there may be
opportunities to intervene and prevent interspecies jumps through strategic
coordination of surveillance and risk assessment activities.
