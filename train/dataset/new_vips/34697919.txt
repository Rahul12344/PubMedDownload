BACKGROUND: Maedi/Visna virus (MVV) is a contagious viral pathogen that causes
considerable economic losses to the sheep industry worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: In China, MVV has been detected in several regions, but its molecular
characteristics and genetic variations were not thoroughly investigated.
METHODS: Therefore, in this study, we conducted next-generation sequencing on an 
MVV strain obtained from northwest China to reveal its genetic evolution via
phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: A MVV strain obtained from Inner Mongolia (NM) of China was identified. 
Sequence analysis indicated that its whole-genome length is 9193 bp. Homology
comparison of nucleotides between the NM strain and reference strains showed that
the sequence homology of gag and env were 77.1%-86.8% and 67.7%-75.5%,
respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NM strain was closely
related to the reference strains isolated from America, which belong to the A2
type. Notably, there were 5 amino acid insertions in variable region 4 and a
highly variable motif at the C-terminal of the surface glycoprotein (SU5).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to show the whole-genome sequence of 
an MVV obtained from China. The detailed analyses provide essential information
for understanding the genetic characteristics of MVV, and the results enrich the 
MVV library.
