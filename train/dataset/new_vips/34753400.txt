Avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes H5N1 and H9N2 co-circulate in poultry in
Bangladesh, causing significant bird morbidity and mortality. Despite their
importance to the poultry value chain, the role of farms in spreading and
maintaining AIV infections remains poorly understood in most disease-endemic
settings. To address this crucial gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study
between 2017 and 2019 in the Chattogram Division of Bangladesh in clinically
affected and dead chickens in farms with suspected AIV infection. Viral
prevalence of each subtype was approximately 10% among farms for which veterinary
advice was sought, indicating high levels of virus circulation in chicken farms
despite the low number of reported outbreaks. Co-circulation of both subtypes was
common in farms, with our findings suggest that in the field, the co-circulation 
of H5N1 and H9N2 can modulate disease severity, which could facilitate an
underestimated level of AIV transmission in the poultry value chain. Finally,
using newly generated whole-genome sequences, we investigate the evolutionary
history of a small subset of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. Our analyses revealed that
for both subtypes, the sampled viruses were genetically most closely related to
other viruses isolated in Bangladesh and represented multiple independent
incursions. However, due to lack of longitudinal surveillance in this region, it 
is difficult to ascertain whether these viruses emerged from endemic strains
circulating in Bangladesh or from neighbouring countries. We also show that amino
acids at putative antigenic residues underwent a distinct replacement during 2012
which coincides with the use of H5N1 vaccines.
