Uracil-DNA glycosylases are enzymes that excise uracil bases appearing in DNA as 
a result of cytosine deamination or accidental dUMP incorporation from the dUTP
pool. The activity of Family 1 uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) activity limits the
efficiency of antimetabolite drugs and is essential for virulence in some
bacterial and viral infections. Thus, UNG is regarded as a promising target for
antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal drugs. Most UNG inhibitors
presently developed are based on the uracil base linked to various substituents, 
yet new pharmacophores are wanted to target a wide range of UNGs. We have
conducted virtual screening of a 1,027,767-ligand library and biochemically
screened the best hits for the inhibitory activity against human and vaccinia
virus UNG enzymes. Although even the best inhibitors had IC50 ≥ 100 μM, they were
highly enriched in a common fragment, tetrahydro-2,4,6-trioxopyrimidinylidene
(PyO3). In silico, PyO3 preferably docked into the enzyme's active site, and in
kinetic experiments, the inhibition was better consistent with the competitive
mechanism. The toxicity of two best inhibitors for human cells was independent of
the presence of methotrexate, which is consistent with the hypothesis that dUMP
in genomic DNA is less toxic for the cell than strand breaks arising from the
massive removal of uracil. We conclude that PyO3 may be a novel pharmacophore
with the potential for development into UNG-targeting agents.
