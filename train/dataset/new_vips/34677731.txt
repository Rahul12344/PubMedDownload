Spike S1 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells to enter the cell and
initiate COVID-19. Since ACE2 is a favorable enzyme, we were interested in
finding a molecule capable of binding spike S1, but not ACE2, and inhibiting the 
interaction between spike S1 and ACE2. Holy basil (Tulsi) has a long history as a
medicine for different human disorders. Therefore, we screened different
components of Tulsi leaf and found that eugenol, but not other major components
(e.g. ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and β-caryophylline), inhibited the
interaction between spike S1 and ACE2 in an AlphaScreen-based assay. By in silico
analysis and thermal shift assay, we also observed that eugenol associated with
spike S1, but not ACE2. Accordingly, eugenol strongly suppressed the entry of
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), into human
ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells. Eugenol also reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced
activation of NF-κB and the expression of IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα in human A549 lung
cells. Moreover, oral treatment with eugenol reduced lung inflammation, decreased
fever, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2
spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1,
but not ACE2, by eugenol may be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment.
