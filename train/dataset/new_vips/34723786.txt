Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem with about
257â€‰million chronically infected people and over 887000 deaths annually. In this 
study, 32 whole HBV genomes of various genotypes were amplified from clinical
isolates to create transfection clones. The clones were sequenced, and their
biological properties characterized by transfecting linear HBV clones into HepG2 
cells. We analysed the SPI and SPII promotor regions, X-gene, BCP/PC sequences,
core, preS/S and HBV polymerase sequences. HBV clones analysed in this study
revealed differential replication kinetics of viral nucleic acids and expression 
of proteins. Sequence analysis of HBV clones revealed mutations in preS1, preS2
and S genes; deletion and insertion and point mutations in BCP/PC region;
including novel and previously reported mutations. Among the patient samples
tested, HBV genotype B clones were more likely to have higher frequencies of
mutations, while sub-genotype A1 and A2 clones tended to have fewer mutations. No
polymerase drug resistant mutations were seen. HBeAg mutations were primarily in 
the BCP/PC region in genotype B, but core truncations were found in genotype E. S
gene mutations affecting HBsAg expression and detection were seen in all
genotypes except A2. Using an HBV clone with repetitive terminal sequences and a 
SapI restriction site allowed us to analyse HBV analyte production in cell
culture and characterize the genetics of viral phenotypes using complete HBV
genomes isolated from serum/plasma samples of infected patients.
