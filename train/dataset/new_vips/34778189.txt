Objective: Public trust in physicians and public health literacy (HL) are
important factors that ensure the effectiveness of health-care delivery,
particularly that provided during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This study
investigates HL as a predictor of public trust in physicians in China's ongoing
efforts to control COVID-19. Methods: Data were gathered in February 2020 during 
the peak of the disease in China. Based on Nutbeam's conceptualization of HL, we 
measure HL vis-à-vis COVID-19 by using a six-item scale that includes two items
each for functional, interactive, and critical HL. Trust in physicians was
measured by assessing physicians' capability to diagnose COVID-19. A rank-sum
test and ordinal logit regression modeling were used to analyze the data.
Results: Two key findings: (a) trust in physician handling of treatment for
COVID-19 is reported by about 74% of respondents; and (b) five of the six HL
measures are positive predictors of public trust in physician treatment of the
disease, with functional HL1 having the highest level of such association
(coefficient 0.285, odds ratio 1.33%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Improving public HL
is important for better public-physician relationships, as well as for nations'
efforts to contain the pandemic, serving as a possible behavioral, non-clinical
antidote to COVID-19. Being confronted with the unprecedented virus, humans need 
trust. Health education and risk communication can improve public compliance with
physicians' requirements and build a solid foundation for collective responses.
