Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an emerging virus
in late 2019 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a
catastrophic effect, resulting in an unprecedented global crisis. The
immunopathology of COVID-19 appears to be clearly associated with a dysregulated 
immune response leading to organ failure and death. Similarly, over two billion
people worldwide are infected with helminth, with those living in
low-middle-income countries disproportionately affected. Helminth infections have
been shown to possess immunomodulatory effects in several conditions. Helminth
co-infection in COVID-19 patients is one of the potential reasons for global
attention to answer why COVID-19 severity is still lower in helminth endemic
countries. Recent studies have shown that helminth endemic countries showed fewer
cases and deaths so far and helminth co-infection might reduce the severity of
COVID-19. Moreover, lessons from other diseases with helminth co-infection have
been shown to substantially reduce vaccine efficacy that could also be implicated
for COVID-19. This immunomodulatory effect of helminth has intended and
unintended consequences, both advantageous and disadvantageous which could
decrease the severity of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine efficacy respectively.
Herewith, we discuss the overview of COVID-19 immune response, immunomodulatory
effects of helminth co-infections in COVID-19, lessons from other diseases, and
perspectives on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
