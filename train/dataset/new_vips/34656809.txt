Epidemiological data on hepatitis B virus (HBV) are needed to benchmark HBV
elimination goals. We recently assessed prevalence of HBV infection and
determinants in participants attending the Emergency Department in Paramaribo,
Suriname, South America. Overall, 24.5% (95%CI = 22.7-26.4%) of participants had 
anti-Hepatitis B core antibodies, which was associated with older age (per year, 
adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.02-1.04), Afro-Surinamese
(aOR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.52-2.19) and Javanese ethnicity (aOR = 1.63,
95%CI = 1.28-2.07, compared to the grand mean). 3.2% of participants were
Hepatitis B surface Ag-positive, which was also associated with older age (per
year, aOR = 1.02, 95%CI = 1.00-1.04), Javanese (aOR = 4.3, 95%CI = 2.66-6.95) and
Afro-Surinamese ethnicity (aOR = 2.36, 95%CI = 1.51-3.71). Sex, nosocomial or
culturally-related HBV transmission risk-factors were not associated with
infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strong ethnic clustering: Indonesian
subgenotype HBV/B3 among Javanese and African subgenotypes HBV/A1, HBV/QS-A3 and 
HBV/E among Afro-Surinamese. Testing for HBV during adulthood should be
considered for individuals living in Suriname, specifically with Javanese and
Afro-Surinamese ancestry.
