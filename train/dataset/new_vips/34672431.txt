BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with an
increased risk of a few malignancies. However, the prognostic impact of HBV
infection remains unclear in cervical cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between HBV infection and survival outcomes
of patients with primary cervical cancer, using overall survival (OS) and
disease-free survival (DFS) as primary endpoints.
METHODS: This analysis was performed retrospectively with newly diagnosed
cervical cancer patients admitted to the Department of Gynecologic Oncology at
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from June 2013 to
October 2019, who were enrolled and followed up. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox 
proportional hazard analysis were used to examine the performance of HBV
infection in predicting OS and DFS.
RESULTS: Patients were followed up for a median of 37.17 months (95% CI,
34.69-39.65). Among the 695 patients, 87 (12.5%) were serologically positive for 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and 276 (39.7%) had a prior history of HBV
infection. There was no significant difference between HBsAg-positive group and
HBsAg-negative patients concerning OS or DFS. Multivariate analysis showed prior 
HBV infection was an independent favorable prognosticator for OS (HR, 0.335; 95% 
CI, 0.153-0.0.734; p = 0.006) and DFS (HR, 0.398; 95% CI, 0.208-0.691;
p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: We provide the first clinical evidence that suggests prior HBV
infection as an independent favorable prognostic factor for patients with primary
cervical cancer.
