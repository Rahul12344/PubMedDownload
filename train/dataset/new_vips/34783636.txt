Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has changed
our lives. Elderly and those with comorbidities represent the vast majority of
patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 symptoms, including acute respiratory 
disease syndrome and cardiac dysfunction. Despite a huge effort of the scientific
community, improved treatment modalities limiting the severity and mortality of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients are still required. Here, we compare the
effectiveness of virus- and patients-centred strategies to reduce COVID-19
mortality. We also discuss the therapeutic options that might further reduce
death rates associated with the disease in the future. Unexpectedly, extensive
review of the literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 viral load seems to be
associated neither with the severity of symptoms nor with mortality of
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This may explain why, so far, virus-centred 
strategies using antivirals aiming to inhibit the viral replicative machinery
have failed to reduce COVID-19 mortality in patients with respiratory failure. By
contrast, anti-inflammatory treatments without antiviral capacities but centred
on patients, such as dexamethasone or Tocilizumab®, reduce COVID-19 mortality.
Finally, since the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 and inhibits its function, we explore the different treatment options
focussing on rebalancing the renin-angiotensin system. This new therapeutic
strategy could hopefully further reduce the severity of respiratory failure and
limit COVID-19 mortality in elderly patients.
