As a new infectious disease, COVID-19 is spread through the respiratory tract in 
most cases. Its source and pathological mechanism are not clear. The most common 
clinical feature is pulmonary infection. Also, a lot patients have
gastrointestinal symptoms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional
cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is like SARS-CoV, a coronavirus
associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The
tissues and cells expressing ACE2 are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and the high expression of ACE2 in intestinal epithelial cells marks that
SARS-CoV-2 may directly infect intestinal epithelial cells. Recent studies also
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 existed and replicated in intestinal environment for a
long time. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and RAS system leads to the
decrease of local anti-inflammatory ability. The virus cycle leads to excessive
imbalance of immune response and cytokine release. The downregulation of ACE2
after viral infection leads to gastrointestinal dysfunction. The above are the
causes of gastrointestinal symptoms. Here, we reviewed the possible causes and
mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by COVID-19. Additionally, we
discussed the influence of gastrointestinal symptoms on the prognosis of
patients.
