Urbanization impacts the community composition, abundance, and richness of
mosquitoes. As urbanization processes increase globally, it is important to
better understand the biodiversity loss caused by anthropogenic changes and
associated impacts on vector-borne diseases. Mosquito surveillance and control
are key for reducing the risk of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission.
