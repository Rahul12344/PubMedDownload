TBM is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Clinical trial data are required to 
provide an evidence base for adjunctive dexamethasone in HIV-positive individuals
with TBM, and to guide clinical practice. This document details the planned
analyses at 12 months post randomisation for the ACT HIV clinical trial
(NCT03092817); 'a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive 
dexamethasone for the treatment of HIV co-infected adults with tuberculous
meningitis (TBM)'. The primary endpoint of the ACT HIV trial is death (from any
cause) over the first 12 months after randomisation. This statistical analysis
plan expands upon and updates the analysis plan outlined in the published study
protocol.
