BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence links ambient air pollution with coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19) disease, an association that is methodologically challenging to
investigate.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between long-term exposure to air
pollution with SARS-CoV-2 infection measured through antibody response, level of 
antibody response among those infected, and COVID-19 disease.
METHODS: We contacted 9,605 adult participants from a population-based cohort
study in Catalonia between June and November 2020; most participants were between
40 and 65 years of age. We drew blood samples from 4,103 participants and
measured immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG antibodies against five viral
target antigens to establish infection to the virus and levels of antibody
response among those infected. We defined COVID-19 disease using self-reported
hospital admission, prior positive diagnostic test, or more than three
self-reported COVID-19 symptoms after contact with a COVID-19 case. We estimated 
prepandemic (2018-2019) exposure to fine particulate matter [PM with an
aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5μm (PM2.5)], nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon
(BC), and ozone (O3) at the residential address using hybrid land-use regression 
models. We calculated log-binomial risk ratios (RRs), adjusting for individual-
and area-level covariates.
RESULTS: Among those tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 743 (18.1%) were
seropositive. Air pollution levels were not statistically significantly
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Adjusted RRs per interquartile range were
1.07 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.18) for NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.14) for PM2.5, 1.00 (95%
CI: 0.92, 1.09) for BC, and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.06) for O3. Among infected
participants, exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 were positively associated with IgG
levels for all viral target antigens. Among all participants, 481 (5.0%) had
COVID-19 disease. Air pollution levels were associated with COVID-19 disease:
adjusted RRs=1.14 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.29) for NO2 and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.32) for 
PM2.5. Exposure to O3 was associated with a slightly decreased risk (RR=0.92; 95%
CI: 0.83, 1.03). Associations of air pollution with COVID-19 disease were more
pronounced for severe COVID-19, with RRs=1.26 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.79) for NO2 and
1.51 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.16) for PM2.5.
DISCUSSION: Exposure to air pollution was associated with a higher risk of
COVID-19 disease and level of antibody response among infected but not with
SARS-CoV-2 infection. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9726.
