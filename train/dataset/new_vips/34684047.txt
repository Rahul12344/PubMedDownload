The adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine have been discovered as the rapid
application of the vaccines continues. Neurological complications such as
transverse myelitis raise concerns as cases were observed in clinical trials.
Transverse myelitis is a rare immune-mediated disease with spinal cord neural
injury, resulting in neurological deficits in the motor, sensory, and autonomic
system. Vaccine-related transverse myelitis is even rarer. We present a case of
acute transverse myelitis after vaccination against COVID-19 with the ChAdOx1
nCOV-19 vaccine (AZD1222), which was the first case reported in Taiwan. Although 
it rarely occurs, post-vaccination neurological complications should not be
ignored. As the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and concern about
vaccination efficacy and safety rises, heterologous vaccination were implemented 
in health public policy in several countries. A literature review of several
clinical trials shows promising effects of mix-and-match vaccination. Further
study on different combinations of vaccines can be expected.
