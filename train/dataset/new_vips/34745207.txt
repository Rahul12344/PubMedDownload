A chicken genome has several regions with quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
However, replication and confirmation of QTL effects are required particularly in
African chicken populations. This study identified single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and putative genes responsible for body weight (BW) and
antibody response (AbR) to Newcastle disease (ND) in Rwanda indigenous chicken
(IC) using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Multiple testing was corrected
using chromosomal false detection rates of 5 and 10% for significant and
suggestive thresholds, respectively. BioMart data mining and variant effect
predictor tools were used to annotate SNPs and candidate genes, respectively. A
total of four significant SNPs (rs74098018, rs13792572, rs314702374, and
rs14123335) significantly (p ≤ 7.6E-5) associated with BW were identified on
chromosomes (CHRs) 8, 11, and 19. In the vicinity of these SNPs, four genes such 
as pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1), GPATCH1, MPHOSPH6, and MRM1 were
identified. Four other significant SNPs (rs314787954, rs13623466, rs13910430, and
rs737507850) all located on chromosome 1 were strongly (p ≤ 7.6E-5) associated
with chicken antibody response to ND. The closest genes to these four SNPs were
cell division cycle 16 (CDC16), zinc finger, BED-type containing 1 (ZBED1),
myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (MX1), and growth factor receptor bound 
protein 2 (GRB2) related adaptor protein 2 (GRAP2). Besides, other SNPs and genes
suggestively (p ≤ 1.5E-5) associated with BW and antibody response to ND were
reported. This work offers a useful entry point for the discovery of causative
genes accountable for essential QTLs regulating BW and antibody response to ND
traits. Results provide auspicious genes and SNP-based markers that can be used
in the improvement of growth performance and ND resistance in IC populations
based on gene-based and/or marker-assisted breeding selection.
