Global control of COVID-19 requires broadly accessible vaccines that are
effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this report, we exploit the
immunostimulatory properties of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the existing
tuberculosis vaccine, to deliver a vaccination regimen with potent
SARS-CoV-2-specific protective immunity. Combination of BCG with a stabilised,
trimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen promoted rapid development of
virus-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of vaccinated mice, that was further
augmented by the addition of alum. This vaccine formulation, BCG:CoVac, induced
high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased cytokine
release by vaccine-specific T cells, which correlated with the early emergence of
T follicular helper cells in local lymph nodes and heightened levels of
antigen-specific plasma B cells after vaccination. Vaccination of K18-hACE2 mice 
with a single dose of BCG:CoVac almost completely abrogated disease after
SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with minimal inflammation and no detectable virus in the
lungs of infected animals. Boosting BCG:CoVac-primed mice with a heterologous
vaccine further increased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, which
effectively neutralised B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These
findings demonstrate the potential for BCG-based vaccination to protect against
major SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating globally.
