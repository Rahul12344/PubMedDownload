INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) meningitis is primarily an infection
of the immuno-compromised. However, it can also affect immunocompetent
individuals. Reactivation of VZV typically presents with a distinct dermatomal
rash suggestive of varicella zoster, but there have also been reports of VZV
meningitis presenting without a rash.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of VZV meningitis in a healthy, 30-year-old male 
presenting to the emergency department shortly after receiving his first
coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir
and then discharged home on oral valacyclovir.
CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians should consider aseptic meningitis in
immunocompetent patients presenting with atypical headaches in this population.
