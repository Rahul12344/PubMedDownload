The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to
spread worldwide as a severe pandemic, and a significant portion of the infected 
population may remain asymptomatic. Given this, five surveys were carried out
between May and September 2020 with a total of 3585 volunteers in the
municipality of Foz do Iguaçu, State of Paraná, a triple border region between
Brazil/Argentina/Paraguay. Five months after the first infection, volunteers were
re-analysed for the production of IgG anti-Spike and anti-RBD-Spike, in addition 
to analyses of cellular immunity. Seroconversion rates ranged from 4.4 % to a
peak of 37.21 % followed by a reduction in seroconversion to 21.1 % in September,
indicating that 25 % of the population lost their circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies 3 months after infection. Analyses after 5 months of infection showed 
that only 17.2 % of people still had anti-RBD-Spike antibodies, however, most
volunteers had some degree of cellular immune response. The strategy of letting
people become naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 to achieve herd immunity is
flawed, and the first contact with the virus may not generate enough immunogenic 
stimulus to prevent a possible second infection.
