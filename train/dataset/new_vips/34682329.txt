Following the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, this study aimed to evaluate the
overall effects of remote blood pressure monitoring (RBPM) for urban-dwelling
patients with hypertension and high accessibility to healthcare and provide
updated quantitative summary data. Of 2721 database-searched articles from RBPM's
inception to November 2020, 32 high-quality studies (48 comparisons) were
selected as primary data for synthesis. A meta-analysis was undertaken using a
random effects model. Primary outcomes were changes in office systolic blood
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) following RBPM. The secondary
outcome was the BP control rate. Compared with a usual care group, there was a
decrease in SBP and DBP in the RBPM group (standardized mean difference 0.507
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.339-0.675, p < 0.001; weighted mean difference
[WMD] 4.464 mmHg, p < 0.001) and 0.315 (CI 0.209-0.422, p < 0.001; WMD 2.075
mmHg, p < 0.001), respectively). The RBPM group had a higher BP control rate
based on a relative ratio (RR) of 1.226 (1.107-1.358, p < 0.001). RBPM effects
increased with increases in city size and frequent monitoring, with decreases in 
intervention duration, and in cities without medically underserved areas. RBPM is
effective in reducing BP and in achieving target BP levels for urban-dwelling
patients with hypertension.
