BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women has important 
impacts on perinatal and neonatal outcomes. However, there are a limited number
of studies investigating the effect of the pandemic period on newborns. With this
study, we aimed to determine the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak on prenatal
care, obstetric outcomes, neonatal mortality and morbidity.
METHODS: The retrospective results of patients hospitalized to the Tertiary
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 1 March and 30 May 2020, the first peak
period of the pandemic in our country, were compared with the data of the same
period of the previous year.
RESULTS: A total of 307 cases were included in our study. The mean gestational
weeks of the neonates hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the
COVID-19 period were higher than those in the control group (p: 0.003). During
the pandemic period, an increase was found in the frequency of pregnant women
presenting to obstetric emergency services in emergencies requiring acute
intervention (p: 0.01). Compared to the control group, there was an increase in
the number of infants with small for gestational age (SGA) diagnosis, 5th-minute 
Apgar score of <7, and newborns with a diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy who were treated with hypothermia in the study group (p < 0.05).
No difference was found in terms of maternal and neonatal mortality (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was shown that pregnant women
disrupted their regular antenatal care, and more pregnant women were admitted to 
the obstetric emergency department with emergencies requiring acute intervention.
This led to an increase in the number of cases diagnosed with SGA and
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborns. Our results will be useful for
better management of current and future pandemic periods.
