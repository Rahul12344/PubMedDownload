Spatio-temporal Poisson models are commonly used for disease mapping. However,
after incorporating the spatial and temporal variation, the data do not
necessarily have equal mean and variance, suggesting either over- or
under-dispersion. In this paper, we propose the Spatio-temporal Conway Maxwell
Poisson model. The advantage of Conway Maxwell Poisson distribution is its
ability to handle both under- and over-dispersion through controlling one special
parameter in the distribution, which makes it more flexible than Poisson
distribution. We consider data from the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
in 2019 (COVID-19) that has threatened people all over the world. Understanding
the spatio-temporal pattern of the disease is of great importance. We apply a
spatio-temporal Conway Maxwell Poisson model to data on the COVID-19 deaths and
find that this model achieves better performance than commonly used
spatio-temporal Poisson model.
