Zika virus (ZIKV) infections during pregnancy can lead to adverse
neurodevelopmental and clinical outcomes in congenitally infected offspring. As
the city of Recife in Pernambuco State, Brazil-the epicentre of the Brazilian
microcephaly epidemic-has considerable disparities in living conditions, this
study used an ecological approach to investigate the association between income
at the neighbourhood level and the risk of ZIKV infections in pregnant
individuals between December 2015 and April 2017. The spatial distribution of
pregnant individuals with ZIKV infection was plotted on a map of Recife
stratified into four categories based on mean monthly income of household heads. 
Additionally, a Poisson regression model with robust variance was fitted to
compare proportions of ZIKV infections among pregnant individuals in relation to 
the mean monthly income of household heads, based on the 2010 census data, across
94 neighbourhoods in Recife. The results provide evidence that the risk of ZIKV
infection to pregnant individuals was higher among those residing in lower-income
neighbourhoods: relative to neighbourhoods that had a mean monthly income of
≥5 times minimum wage, neighbourhoods with <1 and 1 to <2 times minimum wage had 
more than four times the risk (incidence rate ratio, 95% CI 4.08, 1.88 to 8.85
and 4.30, 2.00 to 9.20, respectively). This study provides evidence of a strong
association between neighbourhood-level income and ZIKV infection risks in the
pregnant population of Recife. In settings prone to arboviral outbreaks, locally 
targeted interventions to improve living conditions, sanitation, and mosquito
control should be a key focus of governmental interventions to reduce risks
associated with ZIKV infections during pregnancy.
