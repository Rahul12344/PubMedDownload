The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the world's vulnerability to biological
catastrophe and elicited unprecedented scientific efforts. Some of this work and 
its derivatives, however, present dual-use risks (i.e., potential harm from
misapplication of beneficial research) that have largely gone unaddressed. For
instance, gain-of-function studies and reverse genetics protocols may facilitate 
the engineering of concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens. The risk
of accidental or deliberate release of dangerous pathogens may be increased by
large-scale collection and characterization of zoonotic viruses undertaken in an 
effort to understand what enables animal-to-human transmission. These concerns
are exacerbated by the rise of preprint publishing that circumvents a late-stage 
opportunity for dual-use oversight. To prevent the next global health emergency, 
we must avoid inadvertently increasing the threat of future biological events.
This requires a nuanced and proactive approach to dual-use evaluation throughout 
the research life cycle, including the conception, funding, conduct, and
dissemination of research.
