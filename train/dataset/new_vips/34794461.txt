BACKGROUND: Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of the breast (ENKTL-Breast) is rarely 
detected in clinical practice, and its clinicopathological features remain
unclear.
RESULTS: A consecutive 11-year (2010-2020) ENKTL-Breast case series was
retrospectively analyzed. Eight cases of ENKTL-Breast were selected, with three
primary and five secondary lesions, accounting for 3.5% (8/228) of all breast
lymphomas. All patients were female with a median age of 46 years. Lesions
presented as solid breast masses (8/8, 100%) and were usually located in the
upper outer quadrant of the breast (7/8, 87.5%). B-symptoms were observed in
seven (7/8, 87.5%) cases. Two primary ENKTL-Breast cases showed concomitant
diseases (IgA nephropathy and chronic active hepatitis B). Histological and
immunohistochemical features of ENKTL-Breast were similar to those of ENKTL at
other sites. T-cell receptor rearrangement revealed clonality in all examined
primary cases (2/2, 100%), but only in one secondary case (1/5, 20%). The disease
progressed rapidly in two primary cases and both patients died within 3 and
9 months. For secondary cases, the disease manifested as a disseminated disease, 
with a median survival time of 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that ENKTL-Breast clinically mimics breast cancer
to some extent, though B-symptoms might serve as a distinguishing factor.
ENKTL-Breast is highly aggressive and patients with this disease exhibit a short 
survival time. Primary ENKTL-Breast tends to originate from activated cytotoxic
T-cells, and immune-related diseases may be involved in its pathogenesis and
development.
