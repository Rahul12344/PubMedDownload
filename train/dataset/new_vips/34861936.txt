Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme that has RNA- and
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity, and 
is responsible for the reverse transcription of retroviral single-stranded RNA
into double-stranded DNA. The essential role that RT plays in the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) life cycle is highlighted by the fact that multiple 
antiviral drugs-which can be classified into two distinct therapeutic classes-are
routinely used to treat and/or prevent HIV infection. This book chapter provides 
detailed insights into the three-dimensional structure of HIV RT, the biochemical
mechanisms of DNA polymerization and RNase H activity, and the mechanisms by
which nucleoside/nucleotide and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors block reverse
transcription.
