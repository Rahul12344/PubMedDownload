Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Great international efforts have
been put into the development of prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing
antibodies. However, the knowledge about the B cell immune response induced by
the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive
characterization of the dynamics of immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) repertoire in 
COVID-19 patients. By using next-generation sequencing technology, we examined
the temporal changes in the landscape of the patient's immunological status and
found dramatic changes in the IGH within the patient's immune system after the
onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Although different patients have distinct immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, by employing clonotype overlap, lineage
expansion, and clonotype network analyses, we observed a higher clonotype overlap
and substantial lineage expansion of B cell clones 2-3 weeks after the onset of
illness, which is of great importance to B-cell immune responses. Meanwhile, for 
preferences of V gene usage during SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV3-74 and IGHV4-34,
and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients were more abundant than those of healthy
controls. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could
promote both therapeutic development as well as mechanistic research.
