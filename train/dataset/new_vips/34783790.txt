The COVID-19 has changed the way of working of forensic doctors, and the use of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has gained relevance. But its
implementation, for psychiatric-forensic evaluations, should comply with
standards endorsed by the scientific community. Psycho-legal instruments are
necessary in order to determine the procedural capacity of an accused person to
stand trial. In the Justice of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA),
virtual proceedings are carried out, as the National Government decreed the
obligatory social lockdown. In the case of the criminal jurisdiction, web
platforms and electronic notifications are used for the processing of legal
cases. However, in the practice of forensic medicine, there are difficulties in
the use of ICTs to determine a person's capacity for criminal prosecution.
