Although infection with Strongyloides stercoralis is often subclinical, some
infections persist for decades due to the parasite's autoinfective lifecycle.
Hyperinfection syndrome, however, characterized by a massive increase in parasite
burden as a result of host immunosuppression causes a myriad of clinical symptoms
and is associated with high mortality. Use of corticosteroids and infection with 
HTLV-1 virus are the biggest traditional risk factors for hyperinfection
syndrome, though its development can occur with virtually any degree of
immunosuppression. Recurrent hyperinfection syndrome, though rare, has also been 
demonstrated in persons with ongoing immunosuppression, prompting many experts to
recommend continued prophylactic treatment in at risk populations. We present the
case of a recurrent S. stercoralis hyperinfection occurring four years after
previous treatment with anti-helminthic therapy in a patient with AIDS with
intermittent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), highlighting diagnostic
and treatment issues in the management of recurrent S. stercoralis infection.
