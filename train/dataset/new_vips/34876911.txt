Background: The overlap of malaria and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections present
a major threat to public health throughout endemic countries of tropical and
sub-Saharan Africa. There is a paucity of data on the prevalence and associated
factors of malaria and HBV infections among pregnant women in Ejule, a semiurban 
area of Nigeria. Therefore, the current study was designed to assess the
seroprevalence of malaria and HBV among pregnant women attending antenatal
clinics in Ejule Metropolis.
Materials and Methods: In a hospital-based cross-sectional study, blood samples
collected from 200 apparently healthy pregnant women at the Ilemona Clinic were
screened for Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and HBsAg using histidine-rich
protein 2 (HRP2) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs), respectively. Relevant sociodemographic and putative risk factor
information was obtained with structured questionnaires.
Results: The prevalence of the infections was 44 (22%), 5 (2.5%), and 1 (0.5%)
for P. falciparum monoinfection and HBV monoinfection and coinfection,
respectively. Single and concurrent infections peaked at ages 31-40 years but
decreased with older ages. High P. falciparum, 31 (59.62%), and HBV 2 (3.85%)
infection were observed among those without formal education. Contrary to ages,
occupation, and knowledge of infection, malaria parasitemia differed
significantly with lower educational qualification (p ≤ 0.001), being single
(p=0.001), and inconsistent use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (p=0.04,
OR = 5, CI: 0.10-0.47). History of blood donation (OR = 5, p=0.04, CI:
1.10-32.80) and multiple sex partners (OR = 11.9, p=0.01, CI: 0.01-0.93) were
found to be significantly associated with hepatitis B surface antigenemia rate
during pregnancy. No evidence of HBV infection was observed in women with a
history of HBV vaccination.
Conclusions: Malaria is still highly prevalent among pregnant women due to high
illiteracy and noncompliance to using ITNs. Therefore, routine screening and
educating pregnant mothers are crucial in eliminating malaria in endemic
settings. The low rate of hepatitis B and coinfection with malaria shows that
further improvement in HBV vaccination could considerably reduce the disease
burden among pregnant women.
