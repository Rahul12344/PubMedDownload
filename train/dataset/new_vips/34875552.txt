BACKGROUND: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease arising from
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a main
therapeutic regimen for inhibiting HIV proliferation and viability.
Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HIV-infected patients 
with and without ART could provide theoretical evidence for deep research into
the efficacy of ART and corresponding mechanism.
METHODS: In this study, mRNA microarray data (GSE108296) of HIV-infected patients
who received and didn't receive ART were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. DEGs were obtained through differential analysis with R package
limma. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to identify
hub genes and functional modules. Besides, immune-related DEGs were screened,
followed by GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Moreover, various
immune cells and immune functions in samples were analyzed by ESTIMATE, ssGSEA
and CIBERSORT, based on which the immune function of HIV-infected patients who
received and didn't receive ART was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 109 DEGs were obtained from differential analysis. Among
them, 19 immune-related DEGs were identified and subjected to GO and KEGG
enrichment analyses. Furthermore, PPI network analysis was undertaken on the 109 
DEGs. 10 hub genes and 3 functional modules were further screened. It was shown
that these genes and functional modules were correlated with immune functions and
relevant signaling pathways. ESTIMATE, ssGSEA and CIBERSORT results displayed
that HIV-infected patients with ART presented a relatively high immune level.
CONCLUSION: According to bioinformatics analysis, we reasonably posited that
HIV-infected patients who received ART had an increased immune level relative to 
patients who didn't receive ART.
