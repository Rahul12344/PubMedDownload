BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research on college food pantry operations,
especially in relation to emergency preparedness and disaster relief. However,
there are multiple research studies confirming the efficacy of using social media
to communicate with younger adults, especially Generation Z (Gen Z).
METHODS: This study examines a college food pantry's social media posts and
pantry utilization in a midsize, public university in Texas, prior to and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Collegiate food insecurity was analyzed through the lens
of the socioecological model. Social media data during the spring 2019 semester
were compared using a two-way ANOVA prior to and following the origination of the
COVID-19 pandemic within the state, and pantry utilization over the spring 2019
and fall 2020 semesters was evaluated using a t-test.
RESULTS: There were significantly more likes per post on Instagram than other
social media outlets, and there were significantly more impressions per post on
Twitter as opposed to Facebook, with a trend toward more impressions per posts,
after COVID-19. There was no significant difference in food pantry utilization
between the fall and spring semester aside from a spike after return following
the spring recess, confirmed as Grubb's outlier. Application of the
socioecological model emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration and multitiered interventions during an emergency, including the
use of social media.
CONCLUSION: This information can help collegiate organizations reach more
students through targeted posting on select social media platforms used by their 
students. Interdisciplinary, inclusive approaches are recommended to reduce food 
insecurity for Gen Z students.
