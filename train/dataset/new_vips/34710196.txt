BACKGROUND: E-learning is a relatively trending system of education that has been
placed over conventional campus-based learning worldwide, especially since the
emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess e-learning
readiness among university students of a developing country like Bangladesh and
identify the independent predictors of e-learning readiness.
METHODS: From 26 December 2020 to 11 January 2021, a total of 1162 university
students who had enrolled for e-learning completed a semi-structured
questionnaire. Data were collected online via "Google Form" following the
principles of snowball sampling through available social media platforms in
Bangladesh. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to investigate the
association of e-learning readiness with perceived e-learning stress and other
independent predictor variables.
RESULTS: A total of 1162 university students participated in this study. The
results indicated that with the increase of students' perceived e-learning stress
score, the average e-learning readiness score was significantly decreased (Î² =
-0.43, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.20). The students did not seem ready, and none of the
e-learning readiness scale items reached the highest mean score (5.0). The age,
gender, divisional residence, preference of students and their parents, devices
used, and having any eye problems were significantly associated with the
students' e-learning readiness.
CONCLUSION: During the prolonged period of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning
implication strategies are needed to be assessed systematically with the level of
readiness and its' impacts among students for the continuation of sound
e-learning systems. The study findings recommend evaluating the e-learning
readiness of university students and the mental health outcomes during the
COVID-19 catastrophe in Bangladesh.
