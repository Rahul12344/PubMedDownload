OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the detection of Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to verify the concordance of
EBV-DNA frequency in subgingival sites and in the OSCC.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 30 OSCC patients, aged from 44 to 88 years 
old, was conducted. Samples were collected in subgingival sites and at the OSCC, 
then submitted to DNA isolation, qPCR, and genotyping. Descriptive statistic was 
performed to report the frequency of EBV-DNA in all samples, and McNemar test was
applied to verify the concordance among the EBV-DNA frequency in both sites.
RESULTS: The individuals presented 62 years old in average, and the majority were
male (66.6%). EBV-DNA was detected in 56.7% OSCC lesions. Among the subgroup of
19 dentate individuals, high concordance (73.7%) in both EBV-DNA detection and
the absence in subgingival sites and OSCC was observed, and it was statistically 
significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We report the notable occurrence of EBV-DNA in OSCC; also, the
presence of EBV in periodontal sites may contribute to find it in OSCC, although 
the possible contribution of EBV in the OSCC remains to be investigated.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The identification of this easily accessible site of EBV
latent infection may help to improve the patient's quality of life by maintenance
of oral/periodontal health condition and preventing further possible disorders
related to the virus, and also encourages new approaches for investigating EBV,
periodontitis, and OSCC.
