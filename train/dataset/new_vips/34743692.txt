PURPOSE: Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related keratouveitis elevates intraocular
pressure (IOP). Antiviral therapy does not always control IOP and some patients
do not tolerate systemic antiviral therapy because of the side effects. The
purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients
with CMV-related keratouveitis and determine the impact of glaucoma surgeries on 
the postoperative antiviral therapy regimen.
METHODS: We enrolled twenty-two patients with CMV-DNA-positive keratouveitis
between June 2012 and July 2019 in Kobe University Hospital. The following
clinical parameters were collected: gender, age, history of previous intraocular 
surgery, antiviral medications, visual acuity, IOP, glaucoma drug score, corneal 
endothelial cells density, and the mean deviation of a Humphrey visual field test
at the first visit and before and 1 year after glaucoma surgery.
RESULTS: All twenty-two patients started on oral and/or topical antiviral
therapy. Eighteen patients needed glaucoma surgery despite their antiviral
medications. Nine patients underwent trabeculotomy (TLO) and nine underwent
trabeculectomy (TLE) as the first surgical intervention. Six of patients who
initially underwent TLO and two of the patients who initially underwent TLE
required additional TLE within 1 year. Each of the 15 patients who underwent at
least 1 TLE showed a reduction in the magnitude and variation of IOP and glaucoma
drug scores and 13 patients were able to discontinue antiviral therapy. For the
remaining 4 patients, IOP and inflammation were controlled but with antiviral
medications.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CMV-related keratouveitis, TLE decreases and
stabilizes IOP and contributes to withdrawal from antiviral medications.
