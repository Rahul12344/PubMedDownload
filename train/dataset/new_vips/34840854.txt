Background: Both population-level epidemiological data and individual-level
biological data are needed to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Population-level data are widely available and efforts to combat
COVID-19 have generated proliferate data on the biology and immunoresponse to the
causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, there remains a paucity of systemized data on this subject.
Objective: In this review, we attempt to extract systemized data on the biology
and immuno-response to SARS-CoV-2 from the most up-to-date peer-reviewed studies.
We will focus on the biology of the virus and immunological variations that are
key for determining long-term immunity, transmission potential, and prognosis.
Data Sources and Methods: Peer-reviewed articles were sourced from the PubMed
database and by snowballing search of selected publications. Search terms
included: "Novel Coronavirus" OR "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "2019-nCoV" AND
"Immunity" OR "Immune Response" OR "Antibody Response" OR "Immunologic Response".
Studies published from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were included. To
ensure validity, papers in pre-print were excluded.
Results: Of 2,889 identified papers, 36 were included. Evidence from these
studies suggests early seroconversion in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody titers appear to markedly increase two weeks after infection, followed
by a plateau. A more robust immune response is seen in patients with severe
COVID-19 as opposed to mild or asymptomatic presentations. This trend persists
with regard to the length of antibody maintenance. However, overall immunity
appears to wane within two to three months post-infection.
Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
follow the general pattern of viral infection. Immunity generated through natural
infection appears to be short, suggesting a need for long-term efforts to control
the pandemic. Antibody testing will be essential to gauge the epidemic and inform
decision-making on effective strategies for treatment and prevention. Further
research is needed to illustrate immunoglobulin-specific roles and neutralizing
antibody activity.
