Erythema multiforme is a self-limited condition that is characterized by the
rapid onset of symmetric targetoid lesions. This hypersensitivity reaction is
commonly triggered by herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. 
Pembrolizumab is an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor that is
associated with drug-induced erythema multiforme. Radiotherapy is a rarely
reported trigger of erythema multiforme. We report a case of recurrent
pembrolizumab and radiotherapy-induced erythema multiforme in a patient with
stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed to highlight a unique cause
of erythema multiforme and to review the common radiation-induced cutaneous
reactions.
