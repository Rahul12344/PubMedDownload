The mechanisms involved in the origin and development of malignant and
neurodegenerative diseases are an important area of modern biomedicine. A crucial
task is to identify new molecular markers that are associated with rearrangements
of intracellular signaling and can be used for prognosis and the development of
effective treatment approaches. The proteolipid plasmolipin (PLLP) is a possible 
marker. PLLP is a main component of the myelin sheath and plays an important role
in the development and normal function of the nervous system. PLLP is involved in
intracellular transport, lipid raft formation, and Notch signaling. PLLP is
presumably involved in various disorders, such as cancer, schizophrenia,
Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PLLP and its homologs were
identified as possible virus entry receptors. The review summarizes the data on
the PLLP structure, normal functions, and role in diseases.
