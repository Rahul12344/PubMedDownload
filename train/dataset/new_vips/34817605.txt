In November and December 2016, an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika occurred
in Brownsville, TX. The Texas Department of State Health Services requested for a
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Epi Aid, and as part of that Epi
Aid a team of CDC entomologists was deployed in January 2017. The mission was to 
improve mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance and evaluate the possibility of
continuing local Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission in the city. The mosquito-based
arbovirus surveillance program was expanded from 4 to 40 BG-Sentinel traps evenly
distributed throughout the city. Over a 2-wk period, 15 mosquito species were
detected; the most abundant species were Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti,
and Ae. albopictus, which accounted for 66.7%, 16.2%, and 5.7% of the total
mosquito collection, respectively. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti (1.0
mosquitoes/trap/day) and Ae. albopictus (0.4 mosquitoes/trap/day) was very low
and unlikely to initiate and/or sustain ZIKV transmission. Zika virus was not
detected in the mosquitoes collected, suggesting no or extremely low ZIKV
transmission at that time.
