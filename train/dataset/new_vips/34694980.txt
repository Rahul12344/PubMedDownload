BACKGROUND: The volume of literature about serious gaming in dental education has
increased, however, none of the previous studies have developed a serious game
for closing the gap between preclinical and clinical training.
OBJECTIVE: Virtual Dental Clinic (VDC) is a serious game that was created to help
develop clinical reasoning skills in dental students. This study aimed to
evaluate VDC as an educational tool and its effectiveness on clinical skill and
knowledge gain among clerkship dental students.
METHODS: The following three stages of VDC design and testing were addressed from
2016 to 2020: development, validation, and application. The VDC was developed
using Unity game engine. In the validation stage, the content validity was
reviewed by five visiting staff; construct validity and face validity were
examined by 9 postgraduate-year dentists and 14 clerkship dental students.
Concurrent validity and predictive validity were examined by 34 fifth-year dental
students during their clerkship from September, 2018 to May, 2019, the
associations between VDC experiences, clerkship performance, and the score on a
national qualification test were explored. In the application stage, the VDC was 
set up as a self-learning tool in the Family Dentistry Department from August,
2019, quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted using the 92 clerkship
students' feedback.
RESULTS: The VDC showed good validity and a high potential for education in
practice. Students who have used VDC received significantly higher scores on
qualification test (p = 0.029); the VDC experiences significantly predicted
higher performance score on periodontics (p = 0.037) and endodontics (p = 0.040).
After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, significantly higher proportion of
students confirmed the value of VDC as an assistant tool for learning clinical
reasoning (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The VDC as an educational tool, and the effectiveness on clinical
reasoning skills and knowledge gain among clerkship dental students has been
validated and confirmed in this study.
