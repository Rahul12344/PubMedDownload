Virus-like particles (VLPs) can play important roles in prevention and therapy
for infectious diseases and cancer. Here we describe recent advances in rational 
construction of VLP assemblies, as well as new approaches to enhance long-lasting
antibody and CD8+ T cell responses. DNA origami and computational protein design 
identified optimal spacing of antigens. Chemical biology advances enabled simple 
and irreversible VLP decoration with protein or polysaccharide antigens. Mosaic
VLPs co-displayed antigens to generate cross-reactive antibodies against
different influenza strains and coronaviruses. The mode of action of adjuvants
inside VLPs was established through knock-outs and repackaging of innate immune
stimuli. VLPs themselves showed their power as adjuvants in cancer models.
Finally, landmark clinical results were obtained against malaria and the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
