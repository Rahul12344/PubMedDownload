As countries decide on vaccination strategies and how to ease movement
restrictions, estimating the proportion of the population previously infected
with SARS-CoV-2 is important for predicting the future burden of COVID-19. This
proportion is usually estimated from serosurvey data in two steps: first the
proportion above a threshold antibody level is calculated, then the crude
estimate is adjusted using external estimates of sensitivity and specificity. A
drawback of this approach is that the PCR-confirmed cases used to estimate the
sensitivity of the threshold may not be representative of cases in the wider
population-e.g., they may be more recently infected and more severely
symptomatic. Mixture modelling offers an alternative approach that does not
require external data from PCR-confirmed cases. Here we illustrate the bias in
the standard threshold-based approach by comparing both approaches using data
from several Kenyan serosurveys. We show that the mixture model analysis produces
estimates of previous infection that are often substantially higher than the
standard threshold analysis.
