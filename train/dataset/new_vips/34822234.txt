OBJECTIVES: To determine the main changes that took place in the daily lives of
students in the health area during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in
Brazil.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, carried out from May to June 2020, with
1786 students over 18 years old, regularly enrolled in health courses at higher
education institutions in five regions of Brazil. Sampling was by convenience,
typified as snowball. In order to collect data, an instrument to describe the
sociodemographic profile and the daily lives of students during the pandemic
period was used, which was applied via a digital platform on the web.
RESULTS: The main changes that took place in the daily lives of academic students
in the health area in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil are related to 
lower productivity; difficulty concentrating; increased hours of sleep, use of
electro-electronic equipment and weight; poorer quality of food; higher
consumption of food, legal and illegal substances and medications (mainly
analgesics, anxiolytics and antidepressants); less interest in personal
appearance; and greater contact with relatives. Regarding emotional changes, it
should be underlined the complaints of anxiety, stress, anguish, confusion,
helplessness and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: During the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, the
students in the health area experienced several changes in their daily lives,
which deserve special attention from higher education institutions and health
systems, envisioning interventions to minimize health risks to this population.
