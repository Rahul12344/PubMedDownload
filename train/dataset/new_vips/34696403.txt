Both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and emergence of variants of concern have
highlighted the need for functional antibody assays to monitor the humoral
response over time. Antibodies directed against the spike (S) protein of
SARS-CoV-2 are an important component of the neutralizing antibody response. In
this work, we report that in a subset of patients-despite a decline in total
S-specific antibodies-neutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for 
an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino 
patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that 100% of seroconverting
patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified 
by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from ten out of the
59 subjects which received mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers
and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a
cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. One dose was sufficient for the induction
of a neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate 
virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural
infection status. Like the pattern observed after natural infection, the total
anti-S antibodies titers declined after the second vaccine dose; however,
neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after
the first vaccine dose. Furthermore, our data indicates that-compared with mRNA
vaccination-natural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in
unexposed subjects. This work is an important contribution to understanding the
natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely
impacted by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, by comparing the dynamics of the immune
response after the natural infection vs. the vaccination, these findings suggest 
that functional neutralizing antibody tests are more relevant indicators than the
presence or absence of binding antibodies.
