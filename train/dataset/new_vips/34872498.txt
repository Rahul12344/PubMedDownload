BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a major pathogen that causes
bovine viral diarrhea/mucosal disease (BVD-MD), which has become a global
infectious disease due to its wide spread and the lack of effective treatment.
The process of BVDV infection is complex. Once infected, host immune cells are
activated and modulated. As a major immune cell, peripheral blood lymphocyte
cells (PBLCs) are the primary target of BVDV. In order to further understand the 
mechanism of BVDV- host interaction, the expression profiles of host lymphocytes 
mRNAs associated with BVDV infection were investigated by transcriptomic
sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: The transcriptomic sequencing analysis was performed on bovine PBLCs
infected with CP BVDV-2 GS2018 after 12 h of infection. Gene expression profiling
demonstrated that 1052 genes were differentially expressed in GS2018 infected
PBLCs compared with the control group. Of these genes, 485 genes were
up-regulated and 567 were down-regulated. The 19 differential expressed genes
(DEGs) were selected for validation using quantitative real-time PCR and the
results were consistent with the results of RNA-Seq. Gene ontology enrichment and
KEGG pathway analysis showed that 1052 DEGs were significantly enriched in 16
pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL17, PI3K-Akt, MAPK 
and TNF signaling pathway. PPI network analysis showed that IL17A, IFN-γ and
TNF-α interacted with various proteins and may play crucial roles in BVDV-2
infection. Of note, we confirmed that GS2018 induced Th17 cell differentiation in
PBLCs and persistently increased the expression levels of IL17A. In turn, the
replication of GS2018 was inhibited by IL17A.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the transcription changes of DEGs related to host
immune responses in bovine PBLCs were caused by CP BVDV-2 infection. In
particular, the effector molecules IL17A of Th17 cells were significantly
up-regulated, which inhibited viral replication. These results will contribute to
exploration and further understanding of the host immune response mechanism and
interaction between host and BVDV-2.
