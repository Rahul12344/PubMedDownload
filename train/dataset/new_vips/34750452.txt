Avian influenza is endemic in Bangladesh, where greater than 90% of poultry are
marketed through live poultry markets (LPMs). We conducted a population-based
cross-sectional mobile telephone survey in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh to investigate
the frequency and patterns of human exposure to live poultry in LPMs and at home.
Among 1047 urban residents surveyed, 74.2% (95% CI 70.9-77.2) reported exposure
to live poultry in the past year, with the majority of exposure occurring on a
weekly basis. While visiting LPMs was less common amongst females (40.3%, 95% CI 
35.0-45.8) than males (58.9%, 95% CI 54.0-63.5), females reported greater poultry
exposure through food preparation, including defeathering (13.2%, 95% CI
9.5-17.9) and eviscerating (14.8%, 95% CI 11.2-19.4) (p < 0.001). A large
proportion of the urban population is frequently exposed to live poultry in a
setting where avian influenza viruses are endemic in LPMs. There is thus not only
ample opportunity for spillover of avian influenza infections into humans in
Dhaka, Bangladesh, but also greater potential for viral reassortment which could 
generate novel strains with pandemic potential.
