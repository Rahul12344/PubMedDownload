Cachexia is a complex wasting syndrome, accompanying a variety of end-stage
chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart failure and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It significantly
affects patients' quality of life and survival. Multiple therapeutic approaches
have been studied over time. However, despite promising results, no drug has been
approved to date. In this review, we examine and discuss the available data on
the therapeutic effects of androgens and selective androgen receptor modulators
(SARMs) for cachexia.
