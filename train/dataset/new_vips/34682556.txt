Australia introduced a national lockdown on 22 March 2020 in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Melbourne, but not Sydney, had a second COVID-19 lockdown
between July and October 2020. We compared the number of HIV post-exposure
prophylaxis (PEP) prescriptions, HIV tests, and new HIV diagnoses during these
lockdown periods. The three outcomes in 2020 were compared to 2019 using
incidence rate ratio. There was a 37% and 46% reduction in PEP prescriptions in
Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, with a larger reduction during lockdown (68% 
and 57% reductions in Melbourne's first and second lockdown, 60% reduction in
Sydney's lockdown). There was a 41% and 32% reduction in HIV tests in Melbourne
and Sydney, respectively, with a larger reduction during lockdown (57% and 61%
reductions in Melbourne's first and second lockdowns, 58% reduction in Sydney's
lockdown). There was a 44% and 47% reduction in new HIV diagnoses in Melbourne
and Sydney, respectively, but no significant reductions during lockdown. The
reduction in PEP prescriptions, HIV tests, and new HIV diagnoses during the
lockdown periods could be due to the reduction in the number of sexual partners
during that period. It could also result in more HIV transmission due to
substantial reductions in HIV prevention measures during COVID-19 lockdowns.
