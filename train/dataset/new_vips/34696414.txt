We reported the genetic evidence of circulating hantaviruses from small mammals
captured in a chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) hotspot area of
Sri Lanka. The high seroprevalence of anti-hantavirus antibodies against Thailand
orthohantavirus (THAIV) has been reported among CKDu patients and rodents in Sri 
Lankan CKDu hotspots. We captured 116 small mammals from CKDu endemic regions in 
the Polonnaruwa District of Sri Lanka. Seven animals (five out of 11 Mus booduga 
and two out of 99 Rattus rattus) were PCR-positive for the hantavirus. A
rat-borne sequence was grouped with a THAIV-like Anjozorobe virus. In contrast,
Mus-borne sequences belonged to the THAIV lineage, suggesting a novel
orthohantavirus species according to the phylogenetic analyses and whole-genome
comparisons. Our genetic evidence indicates the presence of two THAIV-related
viruses circulating in this CKDu endemic area, suggesting a basis for further
investigations to identify the infectious virus in patients with CKDu and the
CKDu induction mechanism of these viruses.
