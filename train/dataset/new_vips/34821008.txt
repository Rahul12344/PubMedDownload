The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a serious public health emergency. The virus 
targets cells by binding the ACE2 receptor. After infection, the virus triggers
in some humans an immune storm containing the release of proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines followed by multiple organ failure. Several vaccines are
enrolled, but an effective treatment is still missing. Mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) have shown to secrete immunomodulatory factors that suppress this cytokine
storm. Therefore, MSCs have been suggested as a potential treatment option for
COVID-19. We report here that the ACE2 expression is minimal or nonexistent in
MSC derived from three different human tissue sources (adipose tissue, umbilical 
cord Wharton`s jelly and bone marrow). In contrast, TMPRSS2 that is implicated in
SARS-CoV-2 entry has been detected in all MSC samples. These results are of
particular importance for future MSC-based cell therapies to treat severe cases
after COVID-19 infection.
