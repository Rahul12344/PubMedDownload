OBJECTIVES: To evaluate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient tracheostomy 
outcomes.
METHODS: All COVID-19 patients at the National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, were retrospectively recruited. Those who had tracheostomies between
April and December 2020 were included.
RESULTS: The population was 45 patients, of which 30 (66.7%) were males, 15
(33.3%) were females and the mean age was 66.76±12.74 years. The tracheostomy
indications were anticipated prolonged weaning in 40 (88.9%) and failed
extubation in 5 (11.1%) of the patients. The mean intubation to tracheostomy
duration was 20.62±7.21 days. Mortalities were high, with most attributed to
COVID-19. Mortality and a pre-tracheostomy C-reactive protein (CRP) uptrend were 
significantly related (p=0.039). Mortality and intubation to tracheostomy
duration were not significantly related. The mean post-tracheostomy time to death
was 10.64±6.9 days. Among the survivors, 20 (44.4%) males and 11 (24.4%) females 
were weaned off mechanical ventilation; 9 (20%) remained on ventilation during
the study. The mean ventilation weaning time was 27.92±20 days.
CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate was attributed to COVID-19. Mortality and a
pre-tracheostomy CRP uptrend were significantly related; uptrend patients
experienced far more mortalities than downtrend patients. Unlike previous
findings, mortality and intubation to tracheostomy duration were not
significantly related.
