Influenza D virus (IDV) was first isolated from a swine with respiratory disease 
symptoms in 2011 in the United States. Epidemiological and serological studies
support the hypothesis that cattle represent the natural reservoir of IDV with
periodical spillover events to other animal hosts. Little is known about the
seroprevalence in humans and in specific target groups such as veterinarians in
Italy. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of antibodies against two
influenza D lineages (D/660 and D/OK) in Italy in archived serum samples from
veterinarians working with swine collected in 2004. Serum samples were tested by 
haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) assays. Results
showed that 4.88% (4/82) of tested samples were positive for D/660 and 2.44%
(2/82) for D/OK by HI assay. Three out of four samples showed positivity when
tested by VN assay. Our data suggest undetected IDVs might have circulated and/or
been introduced in Italy as early as 2004 at least in some animal species such as
swine. In addition, it seems that the virus was circulating among veterinarians
before the first isolation in 2011. This finding highlights the importance to
continue monitoring the IDV spread in animals and humans for more detailed
surveillance.
