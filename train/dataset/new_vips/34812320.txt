Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm of people with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although, in the antiretroviral therapy
(ART) era, KS is a rare form of presentation of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome. The authors present a case of disseminated KS in a 23-year-old male.
Just after the diagnosis the patient started ART and then chemotherapy with
placlitaxel with clinical improvement. This case is highly representative of the 
complexity of HIV. The authors aim to bring awareness of an unusual form of
presentation of HIV, and recall the severity and the necessity of an early
diagnosis and treatment.
