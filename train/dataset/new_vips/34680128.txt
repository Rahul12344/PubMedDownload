Among the more recently identified SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) is the
Lambda variant, which emerged in Peru and has rapidly spread to South American
regions and the US. This variant remains poorly investigated, particularly
regarding the effects of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters affecting the 
stability of the Spike protein and its Receptor Binding Domain. We report here an
in silico study on the potential impact of the Spike protein mutations on the
immuno-escape ability of the Lambda variant. Bioinformatics analysis suggests
that a combination of shortening the immunogenic epitope loops and the generation
of potential N-glycosylation sites may be a viable adaptation strategy,
potentially allowing this emerging viral variant to escape from host immunity.
