Health care-acquired viral respiratory infections are common and cause increased 
patient morbidity and mortality. Although the threat of viral respiratory
infection has been underscored by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, respiratory viruses have a significant impact in health care settings
even under normal circumstances. Studies report decreased nosocomial transmission
when aggressive infection control measures are implemented, with more success
noted when using a multicomponent approach. Influenza vaccination of health care 
personnel furthers decrease rates of transmission; thus, mandatory vaccination is
becoming more common. This article discusses the epidemiology, transmission, and 
control of health care-associated respiratory viral infections.
