BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
highly infectious and concealed virus that causes pneumonia, severe acute
respiratory syndrome, and even death. Although the epidemic has been controlled
since the development of vaccines and quarantine measures, many people are still 
infected, particularly in third-world countries. Several methods have been
developed for detection of SARS-CoV-2, but owing to its price and efficiency, the
immune strip could be a better method for the third-world countries.
METHODS: In this study, two antibodies were linked to latex microspheres, using
1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and
N-hydroxysuccinimide, as the bridge to decrease the cost further and improve the 
detection performance. The specificity of the lateral flow immunoassay strip
(LFIA) was tested by several common viruses and respiratory bacterial infections.
Besides, the reproducibility and stability of the LFIAs were tested on the same
batch of test strips. Under optimal conditions, the sensitivity of LFIA was
determined by testing different dilutions of the positive specimens.
RESULTS: The proposed LFIAs were highly specific, and the limit of detection was 
as low as 25 ng/mL for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The clinical applicability was
evaluated with 659 samples (230 positive and 429 negative samples) by using both 
LFIA and rRT-PCR. Youden's index (J) was used to assess the performance of these 
diagnostic tests. The sensitivity and specificity were 98.22% and 97.93%,
respectively, and J is 0.9615. The sensitivity and specificity were 98.22% and
97.93%, respectively, and J is 0.9615. In addition, the consistency of our
proposed LFIA was analyzed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ = 0.9620).
CONCLUSION: We found disease stage, age, gender, and clinical manifestations have
only a slight influence on the diagnosis. Therefore, the lateral flow immunoassay
SARS-CoV-2 antigen test strip is suitable for point-of-care detection and
provides a great application for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic control in the third-world
countries.
