Lymphomatous involvement of the larynx is a rare entity. We present a case of
atypical laryngotracheitis as the initial manifestation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
in a pediatric patient. The diagnosis was aided through the use of microbial
cell-free DNA (mcfDNA) testing, which detected the presence of Epstein-Barr virus
in the patient's plasma. This enabled the consideration of an Epstein-Barr
virus-related lymphoproliferative process, leading to additional workup and the
final diagnosis of lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of mcfDNA
testing leading not simply to an infectious organism, but further to a new
oncologic diagnosis. Plasma mcfDNA testing has the potential to inform clinical
practice beyond classic infectious disease manifestations. In this article, we
review both the possible future applications and the areas of further
investigation that remain.
