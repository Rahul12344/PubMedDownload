A subset of COVID-19 patients is experiencing secondary immune thrombocytopenia, 
also called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or secondary hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 associated
thrombocytopenia is unknown. Very rare cases of vaccine induced prothrombotic
immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) are occurring associated with COVID-19 vaccines. 
COVID-19 VIPIT is associated with autoantibodies targeting platelet factor 4
(PF4) for COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines. Herein, four models for hemophagocytic
histocytes contributions to the etiology of thrombocytopenia associated with
SARS-CoV-2 are proposed. One of the models proposes potential involvement of
hemophagocytic histocytes targeting platelets bound by autoantibodies consistent 
with observed PF4 autoantibodies in COVID-19 VIPIT.
