Evidences related to neuropsychological impact of COVID-19 and its long-term side
effects are beginning to emerge that may take years to catalogue the number of
diseases and their treatments. Nonetheless, as neuropsychologists are evaluating 
COVID-19 survivors, a debate related to the psychiatric and neurocognitive
sequels of past outbreaks, along with the recurrent co-occurrence of PTSD and
acquired brain injuries, may be enlightening. This paper is highlighting the
emergence of mental health issues that can be addressed and treatments can be
provided according to the need of time. Technology has also been increasing day
by day according to the current needs of public. COVID-19 crisis has now shifted 
the focus towards the role of digital health care. For ensuring the best and
right use of tele-health and app tools in such crises, it is suggested that there
is a need for training of mental health professionals to ensure proper protocols 
for improved efficacy.
