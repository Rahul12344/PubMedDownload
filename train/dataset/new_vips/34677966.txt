The pressing need for SARS-CoV-2 controls has led to a reassessment of strategies
to identify and develop natural product inhibitors of zoonotic, highly virulent, 
and rapidly emerging viruses. This review article addresses how contemporary
approaches involving computational chemistry, natural product (NP) and protein
databases, and mass spectrometry (MS) derived target-ligand interaction analysis 
can be utilized to expedite the interrogation of NP structures while minimizing
the time and expense of extraction, purification, and screening in BioSafety
Laboratories (BSL)3 laboratories. The unparalleled structural diversity and
complexity of NPs is an extraordinary resource for the discovery and development 
of broad-spectrum inhibitors of viral genera, including Betacoronavirus, which
contains MERS, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and the common cold. There are two key
technological advances that have created unique opportunities for the
identification of NP prototypes with greater efficiency: (1) the application of
structural databases for NPs and target proteins and (2) the application of
modern MS techniques to assess protein-ligand interactions directly from NP
extracts. These approaches, developed over years, now allow for the
identification and isolation of unique antiviral ligands without the immediate
need for BSL3 facilities. Overall, the goal is to improve the success rate of
NP-based screening by focusing resources on source materials with a higher
likelihood of success, while simultaneously providing opportunities for the
discovery of novel ligands to selectively target proteins involved in viral
infection.
