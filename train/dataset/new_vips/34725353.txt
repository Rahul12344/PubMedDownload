Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are important delivery platforms for
therapeutic genome editing but are severely constrained by cargo limits.
Simultaneous delivery of multiple vectors can limit dose and efficacy and
increase safety risks. Here, we describe single-vector, ~4.8-kb AAV platforms
that express Nme2Cas9 and either two sgRNAs for segmental deletions, or a single 
sgRNA with a homology-directed repair (HDR) template. We also use anti-CRISPR
proteins to enable production of vectors that self-inactivate via Nme2Cas9
cleavage. We further introduce a nanopore-based sequencing platform that is
designed to profile rAAV genomes and serves as a quality control measure for
vector homogeneity. We demonstrate that these platforms can effectively treat two
disease models [type I hereditary tyrosinemia (HT-I) and mucopolysaccharidosis
type I (MPS-I)] in mice by HDR-based correction of the disease allele. These
results will enable the engineering of single-vector AAVs that can achieve
diverse therapeutic genome editing outcomes.
