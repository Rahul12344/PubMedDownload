RIG-I functions as a virus sensor that induces a cellular antiviral response.
Although it has been investigated in other species, there have been no further
studies to date on canine RIG-I against canine influenza virus (CIV). In the
present study, we cloned the RIG-I gene of beagle dogs and characterized its
expression, subcellular localization, antiviral response, and interactions with
CIV proteins. RIG-I was highly expressed and mainly localized in the cytoplasm,
with low levels detected in the nucleus. The results revealed that overexpression
of the CARD domain of RIG-I and knockdown of RIG-I showed its ability to activate
the RLR pathway and induced the expression of downstream interferon-stimulated
genes. Moreover, overexpression of canine RIG-I suppressed the replication of
CIV. The association between RIG-I and CIV was evaluated with the luciferase
assay and by indirect immunofluorescence and bimolecular fluorescence
complementation analyses. The results showed that CIV nonstructural protein 1
(NS1) can strongly suppress the RIG-I-mediated innate immune response, and the
novel interactions between CIV matrix proteins (M1 and M2) and canine RIG-I were 
disclosed. These findings provide a basis for investigating the antiviral
mechanism of canine RIG-I against CIV, which can lead to effective strategies for
preventing CIV infection in dogs.
