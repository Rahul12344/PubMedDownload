Whether direct-acting antivirals (DAA) provide comparable survival benefit with
interferon (IFN)-based therapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to
compare the outcomes after achieving SVR by IFN-based and DAA therapy after
resection of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Consecutive 285 patients
receiving curative resection for HCV-related HCC were retrospectively enrolled,
including 103 (36.1%) and 69 (24.2%) patients with IFN-based and DAA therapy,
respectively. Factors associated with recurrence, overall survival (OS) and
hepatic decompensation-free survival were evaluated. The SVR rate of DAA was
95.7% in HCC patients. During a median follow-up period of 49.6 months, 102
(35.8%) patients died and 63 (24%) developed hepatic decompensation. By
multivariate analysis, SVR by DAA or IFN-based therapy was not associated with
early or late HCC recurrence. Achieving SVR (by IFN-based therapy: HR=0.321,
P<0.001; by DAA: HR=0.396, P=0.011), BCLC stage B-C (HR=1.914, P=0.024), FIB-4
score >3.25 (HR=1.664, P=0.016) and microvascular invasion (HR=1.603, P=0.048)
were independent predictors of OS. Achieving SVR (by IFN-based therapy: HR=0.295,
P<0.001; by DAA: HR=0.193, P=0.002), BCLC stage B-C (HR=2.975, P=0.001), GGT >70 
U/L (HR=1.931, P=0.015) and cirrhosis (HR=2.035, P=0.007) were independent
predictors of decompensation-free survival. The benefit of achieving SVR was
consistently observed in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, and in patients
with and without HCC recurrence. In conclusion, achieving SVR by either DAA or
IFN-based therapy provide comparable and significant reduction of mortality and
hepatic decompensation after surgical resection of HCV-related HCC. DAA therapy
should be prescribed for all HCC patients after curative surgical resection.
