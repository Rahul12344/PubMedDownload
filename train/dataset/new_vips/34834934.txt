A SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC) has been associated with increased 
transmissibility, hospitalization, and mortality. This study aimed to explore the
factors associated with B.1.1.7 VOC infection in the context of vaccination. On
March 2021, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal samples from 14 of 22
individuals vaccinated with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 (outbreak A, n = 26), and 22
of 42 of individuals with two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine (outbreak B, n = 52)
for breakthrough infection rates for ChAdOx1 of 63.6% and 52.4% for CoronaVac.
The outbreaks were caused by two independent clusters of the B.1.1.7 VOC. The
serum of PCR-positive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals had
~1.8-3.4-fold more neutralizing capacity against B.1.1.7 compared to the serum of
asymptomatic individuals. These data based on exploratory analysis suggest that
the B.1.1.7 variant can infect individuals partially immunized with a single dose
of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine or fully immunized with two doses of an
inactivated vaccine, although the vaccines were able to reduce the risk of severe
disease and death caused by this VOC, even in the elderly.
