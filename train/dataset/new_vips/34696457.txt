Rhinoviruses (RVs) constitute a substantial public health burden. To evaluate
their abundance and genetic diversity in adult patients, RV RNA in respiratory
samples was assessed using real-time RT-PCR and the partial nucleic acid
sequencing of viral genomes. Additionally, clinical data were retrieved from
patient charts to determine the clinical significance of adult RV infections. In 
total, the respiratory specimens of 284 adult patients (18-90 years), collected
from 2013 to 2017, were analyzed. Infections occurred throughout the entire year,
with peaks occurring in fall and winter, and showed a remarkably high intra- and 
interseasonal diversity of RV genotypes. RV species were detected in the
following ratios: 60.9% RV-A 173, 12.7% RV-B, and 26.4% RV-C. No correlations
between RV species and underlying comorbidities such as asthma (p = 0.167), COPD 
(p = 0.312) or immunosuppression (p = 0.824) were found. However, 21.1% of the
patients had co-infections with other pathogens, which were associated with a
longer hospital stay (p = 0.024), LRTI (p < 0.001), and pneumonia (p = 0.01).
Taken together, this study shows a pronounced genetic diversity of RV in adults
and underlines the important role of co-infections. No correlation of specific RV
species with a particular clinical presentation could be deduced.
