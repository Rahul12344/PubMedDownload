Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has undergone numerous mutations since its
initial identification, leading to challenges in controlling the pandemic. Till
date, several variants of concern have been identified. However, currently, the
Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is the most dreaded one owing to its enhanced
transmissibility and increased virulence. In addition, this variant can
potentially facilitate fusion of the spike protein to cells or inhibit antibodies
from binding to it. In this commentary, we have simplified the complexity of the 
nomenclature of variants related to COVID-19, concentrating on the Delta variant 
including its transmissibility, response to vaccines, and prevention.
