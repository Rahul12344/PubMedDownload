OBJECTIVES: Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences
of antipsychotic exposure and are disproportionally affected by higher mortality 
from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our goal was to determine whether
concurrent antipsychotic medication use was associated with increased COVID-19
mortality in older patients with preexisting behavioral health problems. We also 
report on findings from post-COVID follow-ups.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients at a geriatric psychiatric clinic in New York City.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographic and clinical data including medication, diagnosis and
Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scales on outpatients who had
COVID-19 between February 28th and October 1st 2020 were extracted from the
electronic health records (EHR) from the hospital.
RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 76 years; 
median age 75 years) and 13 (23.2%) died. We found an increased mortality risk
for patients who were prescribed at least one antipsychotic medication at the
time of COVID-19 infection (Fisher's exact test P = 0.009, OR = 11.1, 95%
confidence interval: 1.4-96.0). This result remains significant after adjusting
for age, gender, housing context and dementia (Logistic regression P = 0.035,
Beta = 2.4). Furthermore, we found that most patients who survived COVID-19
(88.4%) recovered to pre-COVID baseline in terms of psychiatric symptoms.
Comparison of pre- and post-COVID assessments of CGI-S for 33 patients who
recovered from COVID-19 were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: We observed a higher COVID-19 mortality associated with concurrent
antipsychotics use in older patients receiving behavioral health services. The
majority of patients in our geriatric clinic who recovered from COVID-19 appeared
to return to their pre-COVID psychiatric function. More precise estimates of the 
risk associated with antipsychotic treatment in older patients with COVID-19 and 
other underlying factors will come from larger datasets and meta-analyses.
