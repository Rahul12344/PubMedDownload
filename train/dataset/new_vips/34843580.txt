Although sensorineural hearing loss (SHL) is relatively common, its cause has not
been identified in most cases. Previous studies have suggested that viral
infection is a major cause of SHL, especially sudden SHL, but the system that
protects against pathogens in the inner ear, which is isolated by the
blood-labyrinthine barrier, remains poorly understood. We recently showed that,
as audiosensory receptor cells, cochlear hair cells (HCs) are protected by
surrounding accessory supporting cells (SCs) and greater epithelial ridge (GER or
KÃ¶lliker's organ) cells (GERCs) against viral infections. Here, we found that
virus-infected SCs and GERCs induce HC death via production of the tumour
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Notably, the HCs
expressed the TRAIL death receptors (DR) DR4 and DR5, and virus-induced HC death 
was suppressed by TRAIL-neutralizing antibodies. TRAIL-induced HC death was not
caused by apoptosis, and was inhibited by necroptosis inhibitors. Moreover,
corticosteroids, the only effective drug for SHL, inhibited the virus-induced
transformation of SCs and GERCs into macrophage-like cells and HC death, while
macrophage depletion also inhibited virus-induced HC death. These results reveal 
a novel mechanism underlying virus-induced HC death in the cochlear sensory
epithelium and suggest a possible target for preventing virus-induced SHL.
