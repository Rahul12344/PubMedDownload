In November 2019, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan
city, China, and was reported in other countries around the globe. COVID-19 is
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
Strategies such as contact tracing and a vaccination program have been imposed to
keep COVID-19 under control. Furthermore, a fast, noninvasive and reliable
testing device is needed urgently to detect COVID-19, so that contact can be
isolated and ringfenced before the virus spreads. Although the reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is considered the gold
standard method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, this test presents
some limitations which cause delays in detecting the disease. The antigen rapid
test (ART) test, on the other hand, is faster and cheaper than PCR, but is less
sensitive, and may limit SARS-CoV-2 detection. While other tests are being
developed, accurate, noninvasive and easy-to-use testing tools are in high demand
for the rapid and extensive diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, this paper
reviews current diagnostic methods for COVID-19. Following this, we propose the
use of expired carbon dioxide (CO2) as an early screening tool for SARS-CoV-2
infection. This system has already been developed and has been tested on
asthmatic patients. It has been proven that expired CO2, also known as capnogram,
can help differentiate between respiratory conditions and, therefore, could be
used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it causes respiratory tract-related
diseases.
