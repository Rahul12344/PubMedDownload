BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization's aim to eliminate hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection as a public health threat by 2030 is dependent on testing people.
HCV prevalence is higher in prisons, so to increase test uptake an 'opt-out'
approach to blood-borne virus testing in English and Welsh prisons was
introduced.
AIMS: This literature review examines the evidence behind the introduction of
this public health policy.
METHODS: Four healthcare databases were searched for publications between January
2000 and February 2020 on the opt-out approach to blood-borne virus testing in
prisons.
FINDINGS: Sixteen studies published between 2009 and 2019 were included. Analysis
of their findings showed that an increase in HCV test uptake in prisons occurs
when an opt-out approach is used in combination with additional interventions.
Contextual differences between UK and US prisons may affect HCV test uptake.
CONCLUSION: An opt-out approach to HCV testing in prisons can increase test
uptake as part of a complex of interventions.
