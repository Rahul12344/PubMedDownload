BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of people infected with and recovered from
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the extent of major health consequences of
COVID-19 is unclear, including risks of severe secondary infections.
METHODS: Based on 445,845 UK Biobank participants registered in England, we
conducted a matched cohort study where 5151 individuals with a positive test
result or hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the exposed 
group. We then randomly selected up to 10 matched individuals without COVID-19
diagnosis for each exposed individual (n = 51,402). The life-threatening
secondary infections were defined as diagnoses of severe secondary infections
with high mortality rates (i.e., sepsis, endocarditis, and central nervous system
infections) from the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data, or deaths from these
infections from mortality data. The follow-up period was limited to 3 months
after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Using a similar study design, we
additionally constructed a matched cohort where exposed individuals were
diagnosed with seasonal influenza from either inpatient hospital or primary care 
data between 2010 and 2019 (6169 exposed and 61,555 unexposed individuals). After
controlling for multiple confounders, Cox models were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) of life-threatening secondary infections after COVID-19 or seasonal 
influenza.
RESULTS: In the matched cohort for COVID-19, 50.22% of participants were male,
and the median age at the index date was 66 years. During a median follow-up of
12.71 weeks, the incidence rate of life-threatening secondary infections was 2.23
(123/55.15) and 0.25 (151/600.55) per 1000 person-weeks for all patients with
COVID-19 and their matched individuals, respectively, which corresponded to a
fully adjusted HR of 8.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.33-10.59). The
corresponding HR of life-threatening secondary infections among all patients with
seasonal influenza diagnosis was 4.50, 95% CI 3.34-6.08 (p for difference <
0.01). Also, elevated HRs were observed among hospitalized individuals for
life-threatening secondary infections following hospital discharge, both in the
COVID-19 (HR = 6.28 [95% CI 4.05-9.75]) and seasonal influenza (6.01 [95% CI
3.53-10.26], p for difference = 0.902) cohorts.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients have increased subsequent risks of life-threatening
secondary infections, to an equal extent or beyond risk elevations observed for
patients with seasonal influenza.
