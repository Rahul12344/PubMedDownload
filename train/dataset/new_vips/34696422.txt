Over the years, viral infections have caused severe illness in humans. Zika Virus
(ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquito vectors that leads to notable
neurological impairment, whose most dramatic impact is the Congenital ZIKV
Syndrome (CZS). ZIKV targets neuronal precursor cells leading to apoptosis and
further impairment of neuronal development, causing microcephaly, lissencephaly, 
ventriculomegaly, and calcifications. Several regulators of biological processes 
are involved in CZS development, and in this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) seem to 
have a fundamental role. miRNAs are important regulators of protein translation, 
as they form the RISC silencing complex and interact with complementary mRNA
target sequences to further post-transcriptional repression. In this context,
little is known about their participation in the pathogenesis of viral
infections. In this review, we discuss how miRNAs could relate to ZIKV and other 
flavivirus infections.
