Protein-lipid interactions modulate a plethora of physiopathologic processes and 
have been the subject of countless studies. However, these kinds of interactions 
in the context of viral envelopes have remained relatively unexplored, partially 
because the intrinsically small dimensions of the molecular systems escape to the
current resolution of experimental techniques. However, coarse-grained and
multiscale simulations may fill that niche, providing nearly atomistic resolution
at an affordable computational price. Here we use multiscale simulations to
characterize the lipid-protein interactions in the envelope of the Zika Virus, a 
prominent member of the Flavivirus genus. Comparisons between the viral envelope 
and simpler molecular systems indicate that the viral membrane is under extreme
pressures and asymmetric forces. Furthermore, the dense net of protein-protein
contacts established by the envelope proteins creates poorly solvated regions
that destabilize the external leaflet leading to a decoupled dynamics between
both membrane layers. These findings lead to the idea that the Flaviviral
membrane may store a significant amount of elastic energy, playing an active role
in the membrane fusion process.
