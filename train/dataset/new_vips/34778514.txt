The COVID-19 outbreak is a sharp reminder that pandemics, like other rarely
occurring catastrophes, have happened in the past and will continue to happen in 
the future. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging disease. There has been a rapid increase in
cases and deaths since it was identified in Wuhan, China. Even if we cannot
prevent dangerous viruses from emerging, we should prepare to dampen their
effects on society. The current outbreak has had severe economic consequences
across the globe, and it does not look like any country will be unaffected. This 
not only has consequences for the economy; all of society is affected, which has 
led to dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers behave. It is in this
context that this paper describes a device based on a mechanical spray
disinfection system that does not use an electrical source or detection sensor,
thus facilitating the use of this system by anyone. The disinfection process is
launched automatically by the movement of a door, which changes the position of a
piston, triggering the spraying of a disinfectant liquid. This door-controlled
automatic decontamination system could be an effective tool in the fight against 
the current COVID-19 pandemic and, in general, could help to address the health
challenges related to hygiene and disease prevention at low cost.
