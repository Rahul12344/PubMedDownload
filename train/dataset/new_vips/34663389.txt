BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that children who had been breastfed remain 
better protected against various infections, and notably respiratory tract
infections, well beyond infancy. Since the role of breastfeeding to explain why
children are less affected by COVID-19 has not been studied until now, the aim of
this study was to determine whether any history of breastfeeding reduces the
incidence rate of COVID-19 in children.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of an observational study on clinical and 
epidemiological characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 in Majorca. A total of 691 
children were recruited during the 5 months of August-December 2020. Eligible
participants were children under 14 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric
emergency services. The independent explanatory variable was any breastfeeding.
Bivariate analyses were conducted through the Chi-square test, the Fisher's Exact
test or the Student's T test. All children had the same demographic,
epidemiological and clinical data collected through a study team member interview
and via the participants medical records.
RESULTS: Within the sample of children who visited emergency services with
symptoms of potential COVID-19, we found higher prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR test results among those who were exclusively formula fed compared with
those who were ever breastfed (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.45, 3.51; P = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that ever breastfeeding reduces the risk 
of COVID-19 among children, as documented for other infections.
