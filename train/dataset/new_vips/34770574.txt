The speed and accuracy of phenotype detection from medical images are some of the
most important qualities needed for any informed and timely response such as
early detection of cancer or detection of desirable phenotypes for animal
breeding. To improve both these qualities, the world is leveraging artificial
intelligence and machine learning against this challenge. Most recently, deep
learning has successfully been applied to the medical field to improve detection 
accuracies and speed for conditions including cancer and COVID-19. In this study,
we applied deep neural networks, in the form of a generative adversarial network 
(GAN), to perform image-to-image processing steps needed for ovine phenotype
analysis from CT scans of sheep. Key phenotypes such as gigot geometry and tissue
distribution were determined using a computer vision (CV) pipeline. The results
of the image processing using a trained GAN are strikingly similar (a similarity 
index of 98%) when used on unseen test images. The combined GAN-CV pipeline was
able to process and determine the phenotypes at a speed of 0.11 s per medical
image compared to approximately 30 min for manual processing. We hope this
pipeline represents the first step towards automated phenotype extraction for
ovine genetic breeding programmes.
