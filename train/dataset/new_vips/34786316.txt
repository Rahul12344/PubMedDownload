In December 2019, China announced the breakout of a new virus identified as
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), which soon grew exponentially and resulted in 
a global pandemic. Despite strict actions to mitigate the spread of the virus in 
various countries, COVID-19 resulted in a significant loss of human life in 2020 
and early 2021. To better understand the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19,
evidence of its chaotic behavior in the US and globally was evaluated. A 0-1 test
was used to analyze the time-series data of confirmed daily COVID-19 cases from
1/22/2020 to 12/13/2020. The results show that the behavior of the COVID-19
pandemic was chaotic in 55% of the investigated countries. Although the
time-series data for the entire US was not chaotic, 39% of individual states
displayed chaotic infection spread behavior based on the reported daily cases.
Overall, there is evidence of chaotic behavior of the spread of COVID-19
infection worldwide, which adds to the difficulty in controlling and preventing
the current pandemic.
