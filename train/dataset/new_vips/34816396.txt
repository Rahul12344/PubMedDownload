Animals provide food and clothing in addition to other value-added products.
Changes in diet and lifestyle have increased the consumption and the use of
animal products. Infectious diseases in animals are a major threat to global
animal health and its welfare; their effective control is crucial for agronomic
health, for safeguarding food security and also alleviating rural poverty.
Development of vaccines has led to increased production of healthy poultry,
livestock, and fish. Animal production increases have alleviated food insecurity.
In addition, development of effective vaccines has led to healthier companion
animals. However, challenges remain including climate change that has led to
enhancement in vectors and pathogens that may lead to emergent diseases in
animals. Preventing transmission of emerging infectious diseases at the
animal-human interface is critically important for protecting the world
population from epizootics and pandemics. Hence, there is a need to develop new
vaccines to prevent diseases in animals. This review describes the broad
challenges to be considered in the development of vaccines for animals.
