We used viral metagenomics and next-generation sequencing to identify a novel
strain of bocaparvovirus in the intestinal tract of tufted deer (Elaphodus
cephalophus), tentatively named "Elaphodus cephalophus bocaparvovirus" (ECBOV). A
nearly complete genome sequence of 5,354 nucleotides was obtained, which had the 
typical genome organization and protein motifs of a bocaparvovirus. Sequence
comparisons and phylogenetic analysis revealed that ECBOV may be a new ungulate
bocaparvovirus. The identification and characterization of viruses in wildlife
will facilitate our understanding of genetic evolution and cross-species
transmission and thus further reduce the potential threat to human and animal
health.
