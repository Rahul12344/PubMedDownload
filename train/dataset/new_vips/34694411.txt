The Covid-19 pandemic has required all laboratories to rapidly and unexpectedly
reorganize to cope with the increase in requests for tests in rapid response
times and, not least, to provide the shortening of molecular reagents. In order
to validate an accurate, faster and cheaper method suitable for large-scale
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated a simplified workflow by Direct RT-PCR on
181 nasopharyngeal swabs on Seegene's automated platform. Direct RT-PCR ensured
99% overall concordance versus standard RNA RT-PCR in samples with Ct values
under 35, saving 100% on extraction reagents and providing an approximately
three-fold increase in productivity in 24 hours.
