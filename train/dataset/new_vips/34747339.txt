Lassa fever (LF) is a deadly viral hemorrhagic disease that is endemic to West
Africa. The causative agent of LF is Lassa virus (LASV), which causes
approximately 300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths annually. There are currently
no approved therapeutics or FDA-approved vaccines against LASV. The high genetic 
variability between LASV strains and immune evasion mediated by the virus
complicate the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we aim
to provide a comprehensive review of the basic biology of LASV and its mechanisms
of disease pathogenesis and virulence in various animal models, as well as an
update on prospective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for LF. Until
effective vaccines and/or therapeutics are available for use to prevent or treat 
LF, a better level of understanding of the basic biology of LASV, its natural
genetic variations and immune evasion mechanisms as potential pathogenicity
factors, and of the rodent reservoir-vector populations and their geographical
distributions, is necessary for the development of accurate diagnostics and
effective therapeutics and vaccines against this deadly human viral pathogen.
