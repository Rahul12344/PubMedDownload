Intraviral protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells may
provide useful information for deep understanding of virology of SARS-CoV-2. In
this study, 22 of 55 interactions of the structural and accessory proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 were identified by biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)
assay. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was found to have the most interactions among
the structural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and also specifically
interacted with the putative packaging signal (PS) of SARS-CoV-2. We also
demonstrated that the PS core containing PS576 RNA bears a functional PS,
important for the assembly of the viral RNA into virus like particles (VLPs), and
the packaging of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was N dependent.
