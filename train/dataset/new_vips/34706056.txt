BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound effects on
population health to date. African American cancer survivors are particularly
vulnerable to developing severe consequences; therefore, understanding the impact
of the virus on this patient population is critical.
METHODS: The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort is a unique effort to
understand the determinants of poor outcomes in African American cancer
survivors. To date, more than 4500 cancer survivors and nearly 950 primary
caregivers have been enrolled; participation includes a survey and the collection
of biospecimens, medical records, and tumor tissue. Beginning in the spring of
2020, a supplemental survey focusing on the impact of COVID-19 was offered to
enrolled participants. The analysis included 890 survivors.
RESULTS: Nearly all survivors (>99%) reported changes in their daily activities
in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. More than 40% of the survivors
reported some disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial
proportion of the survivors (>40%) reported feeling anxious, depressed, and/or
isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 40% of the patients reported
changes in health behaviors shown to negatively affect survivorship outcomes
(physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol use) as a result of the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on African American cancer
survivors is substantial: it has affected both their physical and mental health. 
Coupled with changes in health behaviors, these factors will likely affect
outcomes in this high-risk patient population, and this makes further study and
interventions necessary to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on
cancer outcomes.
