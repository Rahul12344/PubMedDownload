BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB) is a significant
public health problem that could benefit from treatment with immunomodulators.
Here we describe a set of therapeutic HBV vaccines that target the internal viral
proteins.
METHODS: Vaccines are delivered by chimpanzee adenovirus vectors (AdC) of
serotype 6 (AdC6) and 7 (AdC7) used in prime only or prime-boost regimens. The
HBV antigens are fused into an early T cell checkpoint inhibitor, herpes simplex 
virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD), which enhances and broadens vaccine-induced
cluster of differentiation (CD8)+ T cell responses.
RESULTS: Our results show that the vaccines are immunogenic in mice. They induce 
potent CD8+ T cell responses that recognize multiple epitopes. CD8+ T cell
responses increase after a boost, although the breadth remains similar. In mice, 
which carry high sustained loads of HBV particles due to a hepatic infection with
an adeno-associated virus (AAV)8 vector expressing the 1.3HBV genome, CD8+ T cell
responses to the vaccines are attenuated with a marked shift in the CD8+ T cells'
epitope recognition profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that in different stains of mice including those that 
carry a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen HBV vaccines
adjuvanted with a checkpoint inhibitor induce potent and broad HBV-specific CD8+ 
T cell responses and lower but still detectable CD4+ T cell responses. CD8+ T
cell responses are reduced and their epitope specificity changes in mice that are
chronically exposed to HBV antigens. Implications for the design of therapeutic
HBV vaccines are discussed.
