OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM) and anti-retroviral therapy (ART), a customized combination of different
classes of medications which was also called cock-tail treatment, on the
immunological nonresponse (INR) in people living with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) (PLWH).
METHODS: Relevant literature in databases such as China National Knowledge
Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Wanfang Digital Journal, Chinese Medical Journal 
Database (CMJD), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, Cochrane, 
and Embase was reviewed by two independent investigators. Data were extracted
from the studies according to the eligible criteria and analyzed using Review
Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1078 patients were
analyzed. Our analyses showed that CD4 T cell counts in the treatment group
improved compared with that in the control group [mean difference (MD) = 13.51,
95% confidence interval (CI): 7.42-19.60, P < 0.0001]. There was no significant
difference between the treated and control groups after 3 months (MD = 25.31, 95%
CI: ?2.78 to 53.41, P = 0.08). However, after 6 and 12 months, the response of
the treatment group was superior to the control group (MD = 27.45, 95% CI:
7.09-47.81, P = 0.008 and MD = 27.34, 95% CI: 6.31-48.37, P = 0.01,
respectively). The clinical efficacy of the treatment group was also higher than 
that of the control group (RR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.16-2.65, P = 0.007). However,
CD45RO and CD45RA T cell counts did not differ significantly between the two
groups (MD = 12.37, 95% CI: ?6.71 to 31.45, P = 0.20 and MD = 5.67, 95% CI: ?3.00
to14.35, P = 0.20, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The combined treatment strategy of integrated TCM and Western
Medicine promotes long-term reconstitution of the immune system and thus, is
beneficial and has potential use for improving INR in PLWH. However, large-scale 
RCTs are required to provide evidence for optimal intervention strategies.
