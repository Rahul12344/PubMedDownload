BACKGROUND: During the SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic efforts to reduce virus
transmission resulted in non-emergency patients being deterred from seeking help.
The number of patients presenting with acute cardiac conditions reduced,
significantly OBJECTIVES: To explore the decision-making process, and influential
factors in that process, of patients and their family during an acute cardiac
event.
METHODS: A qualitative research design was employed using purposive sampling of
patients who experienced an acute cardiac event during the social containment
mandates. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with thematic analysis of
interview transcripts.
RESULTS: Twenty-five participants were recruited from three UK hospitals. Themes 
identified were reliance on informal support network, lack of awareness of
cardiac symptoms leading to delayed help-seeking, and an indirect COVID-19 effect
(e.g. avoiding treatment).
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the need for informed public health
messages, targeting patients and their support networks, that allow those in need
of treatment to access care.
