PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms
from COVID-19 than the general population. We developed and tested an automated
text-based remote symptom-monitoring program to facilitate early detection of
worsening symptoms and rapid assessment for patients with cancer and suspected or
confirmed COVID-19.
METHODS: We conducted a feasibility study of Cancer COVID Watch, an automated
COVID-19 symptom-monitoring program with oncology nurse practitioner (NP)-led
triage among patients with cancer between April 23 and June 30, 2020. Twenty-six 
patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Enrolled 
patients received twice daily automated text messages over 14 days that asked
"How are you feeling compared to 12 hours ago? Better, worse, or the same?" and, 
if worse, "Is it harder than usual for you to breathe?" Patients who responded
worse and yes were contacted within 1 hour by an oncology NP.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 62.5 years. Seventeen (65%) were female, 10
(38%) Black, and 15 (58%) White. Twenty-five (96%) patients responded to â‰¥ 1
symptom check-in, and overall response rate was 78%. Four (15%) patients were
escalated to the triage line: one was advised to present to the emergency
department (ED), and three were managed in the outpatient setting. Median time
from escalation to triage call was 11.5 minutes. Four (15%) patients presented to
the ED without first escalating their care via our program. Participant
satisfaction was high (Net Promoter Score: 100, n = 4).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of an intensive remote symptom monitoring and rapid NP
triage program for outpatients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19
infection is possible. Similar tools may facilitate more rapid triage for
patients with cancer in future pandemics.
