Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are
highly transmissible intestinal infections caused by transmissible
gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV),
respectively. They are clinically associated with vomiting, diarrhea, and
dehydration in piglets. An imbalance in Na+ uptake by intestinal epithelial cells
causes TGEV/PEDV-induced diarrhea. However, the mechanism by which
TGEV/PEDV-infection in piglets causes Na+ imbalance diarrhea has not been
elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that specific inhibition of
NHE3 activity caused small intestinal bulging, intestinal wall thinning and
severe diarrhea in piglets, consistent with the signs of TGEV/PEDV infection.
This study further elucidated the role of NHE3 in TGEV/PEDV-induced diarrhea. In 
this study, small intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were used as a model of
infection. The results showed that TGEV/PEDV infection reduced NHE3 activity and 
Na+ uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. Further studies revealed that the use of
NHE3-specific inhibitors could reduce the amount of cell membrane NHE3, thereby
decreasing Na+ uptake and ultimately leading to diarrhea. Transcriptomic studies 
performed on obtained jejunal tissues were also consistent with pre-laboratory
results. This study will provide a basis for understanding Na+ imbalance diarrhea
caused by TGEV/PEDV, as well as for elucidating the diarrheal pathogenesis of
other members of α-animal coronaviruses.
