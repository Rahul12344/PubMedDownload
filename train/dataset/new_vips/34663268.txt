BACKGROUND: Previous studies have observed a close association between hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as
extrahepatic cancers. However, research concerning the effect of HBV infection on
the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rare and inconsistent. This study aims to 
determine the relationship between HBV infection and new-onset CRC.
METHODS: We prospectively examined the relationship between HBV infection and
new-onset CRC among 93,390 participants from Kailuan Cohort study. Cox
proportional hazards regression models, subgroup analyses and competing risk
analyses were used to evaluate the association between HBV infection and the risk
of new-onset CRC.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.28 years, 448 incident CRC cases were
identified. The adjusted HR (95%confidence interval (CI)) for the association of 
HBsAg Seropositive with CRC was 1.85(1.15 ~ 2.96) in the Cox regression. Subgroup
analyses showed that the HBsAg seropositive group was associated with increased
risk of new-onset CRC among male, middle-aged, normal weight, smokers and
non-drinker participants, respectively. A positive association of HBV infection
with the risk of CRC was observed in the adjusted sub-distribution proportional
hazards (SD) models (HRSD = 1.77, 95% CI:1.11-2.84) and cause-specific hazards
(CS) models (HRCS = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.13-2.91).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results have found a significant association between HBV
infection and the risk of incident CRC among Chinese participants.
