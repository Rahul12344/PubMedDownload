The predictive accuracy of mathematical models representing anything ranging from
the meteorological to the biological system profoundly depends on the quality of 
model parameters derived from experimental data. Hence, robust sensitivity
analysis (SA) of these critical model parameters aids in sifting the influential 
from the negligible out of typically vast parameter regimes, thus illuminating
key components of the system under study. We here move beyond traditional local
sensitivity analysis to the adoption of global SA techniques. Partial rank
correlation coefficient (PRCC) based on Latin hypercube sampling is compared with
the variance-based Sobol method. We selected for this SA investigation an
infection model for the hepatitis-B virus (HBV) that describes infection dynamics
and clearance of HBV in the liver [Murray & Goyal, 2015]. The model tracks viral 
particles such as the tenacious and nearly ineradicable covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) embedded in infected nuclei and an HBV protein known as
p36. Our application of these SA methods to the HBV model illuminates, especially
over time, the quantitative relationships between cccDNA synthesis rate and p36
synthesis and export. Our results reinforce previous observations that the viral 
protein, p36, is by far the most influential factor for cccDNA replication.
Moreover, both methods are capable of finding crucial parameters of the model.
Though the Sobol method is independent of model structure (e.g., linearity and
monotonicity) and well suited for SA, our results ensure that LHS-PRCC suffices
for SA of a non-linear model if it is monotonic.
