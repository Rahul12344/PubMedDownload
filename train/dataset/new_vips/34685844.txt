Hepatitis B and C viruses chronically affect approximately 3.5% of the global
population, causing more than 800,000 deaths yearly due to severe liver
pathogenesis. Current HBV vaccines have significantly contributed to the
reduction of chronic HBV infections, supporting the notion that virus eradication
is a feasible public health objective in the near future. In contrast to HBV, a
prophylactic vaccine against HCV infection is not available yet; however, intense
research efforts within the last decade have significantly advanced the field and
several vaccine candidates are shortlisted for clinical trials. A successful
vaccine against an infectious disease of global importance must not only be
efficient and safe, but also easy to produce, distribute, administer, and
economically affordable to ensure appropriate coverage. Some of these
requirements could be fulfilled by oral vaccines that could complement
traditional immunization strategies. In this review, we discuss the potential of 
edible plant-based oral vaccines in assisting the worldwide fight against
hepatitis B and C infections. We highlight the latest research efforts to reveal 
the potential of oral vaccines, discuss novel antigen designs and delivery
strategies, as well as the limitations and controversies of oral administration
that remain to be addressed to make this approach successful.
