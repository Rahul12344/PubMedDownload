In a total of 1536 blood serum samples analysed by ELISA, antibodies for IAV
nucleoprotein (NP) were detected in 30.3%. Results from HI show that the most
common subtype of swIAV in the Croatian pig population was H1N1 (44.6%), followed
by H3N2 (42.7%) and H1N2 (26.3%). Antibodies to at least one subtype were
detected in 62.19% of blood serum samples. Detection of swIAV antigen was
performed by IHC and detected in 8 of 28 lung samples collected post-mortem. The 
matrix (M) gene was detected in nine of one hundred and forty-two lung tissue
samples and in seven of twenty-nine nasopharyngeal swabs. Phylogenetic analysis
of amplified HA and NA gene fragments in Croatian isolates suggests the presence 
of swIAV H1avN1av.
