A shift occurred in medical school education due to the novel coronavirus
disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. It has been more than a year since the start of
the pandemic, and many medical schools have had to adapt quickly. The medical
school curriculum had to be changed in order to accommodate the risk of the
virus, which has caused an interruption in clinical education for both
preclinical and clinical medical students. Limited hands-on labs, remote
standardized patient encounters, telemedicine education and other substitutes
have been used to bridge this gap within in-person learning. This review
discusses the changes in curricula that some schools have taken, and the benefits
and disadvantages of these selected methods.
