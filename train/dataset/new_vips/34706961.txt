INTRODUCTION: Communicable disease epidemics and pandemics magnify the health
inequities experienced by marginalised populations. People who use substances
suffer from high rates of morbidity and mortality and should be a priority to
receive palliative care, yet they encounter many barriers to palliative care
access. Given the pre-existing inequities to palliative care access for people
with life-limiting illnesses who use substances, it is important to understand
the impact of communicable disease epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19 on
this population.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review and report according to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. We conducted a comprehensive literature
search in seven bibliographical databases from the inception of each database to 
August 2020. We also performed a grey literature search to identify the
publications not indexed in the bibliographical databases. All the searches will 
be rerun in April 2021 to retrieve recently published information because the
COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing at the time of this writing. We will extract the
quantitative data using a standardised data extraction form and summarise it
using descriptive statistics. Additionally, we will conduct thematic qualitative 
analyses and present our findings as narrative summaries.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for a scoping review.
We will disseminate our findings to healthcare providers and policymakers through
professional networks, digital communications through social media platforms,
conference presentations and publication in a scientific journal.
