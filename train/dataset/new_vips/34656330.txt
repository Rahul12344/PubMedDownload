Across species, a common protein assembly arises: proteins containing structured 
domains separated by long intrinsically disordered regions, and dimerized through
a self-association domain or through strong protein interactions. These systems
are termed "IDP duplexes." These flexible dimers have roles in diverse
pathologies including development of cancer, viral infections, and
neurodegenerative disease. Here we discuss the role of disorder in IDP duplexes
with similar domain architectures that bind hub protein, LC8. LC8-binding IDP
duplexes are categorized into three groups: IDP duplexes that contain a
self-association domain that is extended by LC8 binding, IDP duplexes that have
no self-association domain and are dimerized through binding several copies of
LC8, and multivalent LC8-binders that also have a self-association domain.
Additionally, we discuss non-LC8-binding IDP duplexes with similar domain
organizations, including the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. We propose that 
IDP duplexes have structural features that are essential in many biological
processes and that improved understanding of their structure function
relationship will provide new therapeutic opportunities.
