Background & Aims: Immune-mediated induction of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B)
expression leads to HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) decay. Here, we
aimed to decipher the signalling pathway(s) and regulatory mechanism(s) involved 
in A3B induction and related HBV control.
Methods: Differentiated HepaRG cells (dHepaRG) knocked-down for NF-κB signalling 
components, transfected with siRNA or micro RNAs (miRNA), and primary human
hepatocytes ± HBV or HBVΔX or HBV-RFP, were treated with lymphotoxin beta
receptor (LTβR)-agonist (BS1). The biological outcomes were analysed by reverse
transcriptase-qPCR, immunoblotting, luciferase activity, chromatin immune
precipitation, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, targeted-bisulfite-, miRNA-,
RNA-, genome-sequencing, and mass-spectrometry.
Results: We found that canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathways are 
mandatory for A3B induction and anti-HBV effects. The degree of immune-mediated
A3B production is independent of A3B promoter demethylation but is controlled
post-transcriptionally by the miRNA 138-5p expression (hsa-miR-138-5p), promoting
A3B mRNA decay. Hsa-miR-138-5p over-expression reduced A3B levels and its
antiviral effects. Of note, established infection inhibited BS1-induced A3B
expression through epigenetic modulation of A3B promoter. Twelve days of
treatment with a LTβR-specific agonist BS1 is sufficient to reduce the cccDNA
pool by 80% without inducing significant damages to a subset of cancer-related
host genes. Interestingly, the A3B-mediated effect on HBV is independent of the
transcriptional activity of cccDNA as well as on rcDNA synthesis.
Conclusions: Altogether, A3B represents the only described enzyme to target both 
transcriptionally active and inactive cccDNA. Thus, inhibiting hsa-miR-138-5p
expression should be considered in the combinatorial design of new therapies
against HBV, especially in the context of immune-mediated A3B induction.
Lay summary: Immune-mediated induction of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B is
transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB signalling and post-transcriptionally
downregulated by hsa-miR-138-5p expression, leading to cccDNA decay. Timely
controlled APOBEC3B-mediated cccDNA decay occurs independently of cccDNA
transcriptional activity and without damage to a subset of cancer-related genes. 
Thus, APOBEC3B-mediated cccDNA decay could offer an efficient therapeutic
alternative to target hepatitis B virus chronic infection.
