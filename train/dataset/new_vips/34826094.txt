Although the functional parameters of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been explored to
some extent, the roles of these molecules in coronavirus infection and the
regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in virus infection are still unclear.
Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathgenic coronavirus and 
causes high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets. Here, we demonstrated
that microRNA-27b-3p (miR-27b-3p) suppressed TGEV replication by directly
targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6), while TGEV
infection downregulated miR-27b-3p expression in swine testicular (ST) cells and 
in piglets. Mechanistically, the decrease of miR-27b-3p expression during TGEV
infection was mediated by the activated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)
pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Further studies showed that
when ER stress was induced by TGEV, IRE1 acted as an RNase activated by
autophosphorylation and unconventionally spliced mRNA encoding a potent
transcription factor, X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1s). Xbp1s inhibited the
transcription of miR-27 and ultimately reduced the production of miR-27b-3p.
Therefore, our findings indicate that TGEV inhibits the expression of an
anti-coronavirus microRNA through the IRE1 pathway and suggest a novel way in
which coronavirus regulates the host cell response to infection.
