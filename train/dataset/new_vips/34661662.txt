Importance: Many insurers waived cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations
during 2020. Nonetheless, patients may have been billed if their plans did not
implement waivers or if waivers did not capture all hospitalization-related care.
Assessment of out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 may
show the financial burden that patients may experience if insurers allow waivers 
to expire, as many chose to do during 2021.
Objective: To estimate out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in
the US in 2020.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 
IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics Database, a national claims database
representing 7.7 million privately insured patients and 1.0 million Medicare
Advantage patients, regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations for privately insured and
Medicare Advantage patients from March to September 2020.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean total out-of-pocket spending, defined as the sum
of out-of-pocket spending for facility services billed by hospitals (eg,
accommodation charges) and professional and ancillary services billed by
clinicians and ancillary providers (eg, clinician inpatient evaluation and
management, ambulance transport).
Results: Analyses included 4075 hospitalizations; 2091 (51.3%) were for male
patients, and the mean (SD) age of patients was 66.8 (14.8) years. Of these
hospitalizations, 1377 (33.8%) were for privately insured patients. Out-of-pocket
spending for facility services, professional and ancillary services, or both was 
reported for 981 of 1377 hospitalizations for privately insured patients (71.2%) 
and 1324 of 2968 hospitalizations for Medicare Advantage patients (49.1%). Among 
these hospitalizations, mean (SD) total out-of-pocket spending was $788 ($1411)
for privately insured patients and $277 ($363) for Medicare Advantage patients.
In contrast, out-of-pocket spending for facility services was reported for 63
hospitalizations for privately insured patients (4.6%) and 36 hospitalizations
for Medicare Advantage patients (1.3%). Among these hospitalizations, mean (SD)
total out-of-pocket spending was $3840 ($3186) for privately insured patients and
$1536 ($1402) for Medicare Advantage patients. Total out-of-pocket spending
exceeded $4000 for 2.5% of privately insured hospitalizations compared with 0.2% 
of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, few patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020 were billed for facility services provided by
hospitals, suggesting that most were covered by insurers with cost-sharing
waivers. However, many patients were billed for professional and ancillary
services, suggesting that insurer cost-sharing waivers may not have covered all
hospitalization-related care. High cost sharing for patients who were billed by
facility services suggests that out-of-pocket spending may be substantial for
patients whose insurers have allowed waivers to expire.
