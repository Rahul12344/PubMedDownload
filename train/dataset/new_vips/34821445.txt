AIMS: To compare the heat stability of two globally prevalent human norovirus
(HuNoV) strains (GII.2[P16] and GII.4[P16]) and a commonly used HuNoV surrogate, 
Tulane virus (TV).
METHODS AND RESULTS: With the use of a newly developed zebrafish larvae platform,
we measured the change of infectivity of HuNoV GII.2[P16] and GII.4[P16] toward
mild heat treatment at 55°C for 5 min. TV was tested with the same experimental
design. As a result, the virus infectivity measurement clearly indicated the
higher heat resistance of HuNoV GII.2[P16] (no reduction) than GII.4[P16]
(>0.8-log TCID50  ml-1 reduction) and TV (2.5-log TCID50  ml-1 reduction).
Further exploration revealed higher virus structural stability of HuNoV GII.2
than GII.4 strains by the use of different clinical samples with different
evaluation methods.
CONCLUSION: The inactivation data generated from the surrogate virus TV cannot be
used directly to describe the inactivation of HuNoV. The phylogenetic
classification of HuNoVs may correlate with the virus stability and/or
circulation dynamics.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is expected to serve as an
important reference when revisiting the numerous previous data evaluating HuNoV
inactivation conditions in foods with the use of TV as the cultivable surrogate
or with genuine HuNoV but using molecular methods. The higher resistance of NoV
GII.2 strains than GII.4 strains toward inactivation treatment supplies a
possible explanation for the global re-emerging of NoV GII.2 epidemic in recent
years.
