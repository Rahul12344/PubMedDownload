BACKGROUND: In response to the goal of the World Health Organisation to eliminate
hepatitis C virus infections by 2030, Romania is striving for national
elimination. An already successful micro-elimination project was expanded to
test-and-treat specific populations and at-risk groups. The aim of this project
was to identify the individuals with HCV infection in disadvantaged regions who
do not have proper medical care access.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our two-arm interventional cross-sectional study used
rapid anti-HCV antibody testing on two population groups from the Romanian
southwestern region of Oltenia, approached between September 2020 and May 2021.
The first group consisted of predominantly over 40 years old individuals,
recruited through five family doctors from two medium-sized towns (community
lot-CL). We approached a second group, aged 18-65, through 11 medical offices of 
five large factories in the same region (industry lot, IL). A 12-items
questionnaire was given to each participant, to determine risk factors and record
demographic data. Eligible patients initiated antiviral therapy using
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).
RESULTS: We enrolled 15,383 individuals between all 16 locations. The overall
prevalence by antibody testing was 0.77% (119 cases). Of these, 57 subsequently
received treatment with DAAs. We identified blood transfusions as a risk factor
within the CL. Participants in the IL reported a relatively high risk for the
following situations: sharing of personal hygiene belongings with another person,
performing previous blood transfusions, dental interventions and previous
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In this global context, the use of micro-elimination allows
interventions to be faster and more efficient. This is possible by targeting
smaller and specific HCV risk groups.
