Background: Respiratory protective equipment recommended in the UK for healthcare
workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID-19 comprises a fluid-resistant
surgical mask (FRSM), except in the context of aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). We previously demonstrated frequent pauci- and asymptomatic severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection HCWs during the first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, using a comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening
programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020).
Methods: Here, we use observational data and mathematical modelling to analyse
infection rates amongst HCWs working on 'red' (coronavirus disease 2019,
COVID-19) and 'green' (non-COVID-19) wards during the second wave of the
pandemic, before and after the substitution of filtering face piece 3 (FFP3)
respirators for FRSMs.
Results: Whilst using FRSMs, HCWs working on red wards faced an approximately
31-fold (and at least fivefold) increased risk of direct, ward-based infection.
Conversely, after changing to FFP3 respirators, this risk was significantly
reduced (52-100% protection).
Conclusions: FFP3 respirators may therefore provide more effective protection
than FRSMs for HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19, whether or not AGPs are
undertaken.
