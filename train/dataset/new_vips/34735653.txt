PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive
chemo-resistant malignancy secondary to HTLV-1 retrovirus. Prognosis of ATL
remains dismal. Herein, we emphasized on the current ATL treatment modalities and
their drawbacks, and opened up on promising targeted therapies with special focus
on the HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HBZ.
RECENT FINDINGS: Indolent ATL and a fraction of acute ATL exhibit long-term
survival following antiviral treatment with zidovudine and interferon-alpha.
Monoclonal antibodies such as mogamulizumab improved response rates, but with
little effect on survival. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation results 
in long-term survival in one third of transplanted patients, alas only few
patients are transplanted. Salvage therapy with lenalidomide in
relapsed/refractory patients leads to prolonged survival in some of them. ATL
remains an unmet medical need. Targeted therapies focusing on the HTLV-1 viral
replication and/or viral regulatory proteins, as well as on the host antiviral
immunity, represent a promising approach for the treatment of ATL.
