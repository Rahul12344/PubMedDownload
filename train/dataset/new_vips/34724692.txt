Terbinafine is a drug that can induce acute liver damage. We present the case of 
a 40-year-old male patient who developed liver dysfunction after 35 days of
terbinafine treatment for onychomycosis. The anatomopathological study showed:
acute hepatitis in resolution, in addition to ductopenia and cholestasis. These
findings, without a history of viral or autoimmune hepatitis, are consistent with
the diagnosis of drug-induced liver damage (DILI). In this report we present the 
first case in our country of a patient who is affected by an acute liver disease:
terbinafine-induced liver injury, to which SARS-CoV-2 infection was later
associated in the context of a pandemic.
