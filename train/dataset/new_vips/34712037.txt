Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although, respiratory symptoms are typical
the digestive system is also a susceptible target with gastrointestinal symptoms 
present even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The gastrointestinal
symptoms of COVID-19 include diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea among
other symptoms. Some questions that remain to be answered include: Do patients
with gastrointestinal symptoms have a higher mortality? SARS-CoV-2 variants are
already a global reality: Do these variants present with a greater prevalence of 
gastrointestinal symptoms? Do patients with these symptoms warrant more intensive
care unit care?
