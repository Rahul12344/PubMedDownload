OBJECTIVE: Patients treated with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) are known to
have compromised immune systems and respiratory function, both of which make them
particularly susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The objective of this study was
to assess the risk of developing severe clinical outcomes among COVID-19
non-cancer patients on LTOT, compared with those without LTOT.
DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A retrospective cohort design using electronic health
records in the TriNetX research database.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 418 216 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 in
January-December 2020 from 51 US healthcare organisations: 9558 in the LTOT and
408 658 in the control cohort. They did not have cancer diagnoses; only a small
proportion might have been treated with opioid maintenance for opioid use
disorder.
RESULTS: Patient on LTOT had a higher risk ratio (RR) than control patients to
visit an emergency department (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.93 to 2.16) and be hospitalised 
(RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.69 to 3.15). Once admitted, LTOT patients were more likely to 
require intensive care (RR 3.65, 95% CI 3.10 to 4.29), mechanical ventilation (RR
3.47, 95% CI 2.89 to 4.15) and vasopressor support (RR 5.28, 95% CI 3.70 to 7.53)
and die within 30 days (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.30). The LTOT group also showed
increased risk (RRs from 2.06 to 3.98, all significant to 95% CI) of more-severe 
infection (eg, cough, dyspnoea, fever, hypoxaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome). Statistically significant differences in several 
laboratory results and other vital signs appeared clinically negligible.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients on LTOT were at higher risk of increased morbidity,
mortality and healthcare utilisation. Interventions to reduce the need for LTOT
and to increase compliance with COVID-19 protective measures may improve outcomes
and reduce healthcare cost in this population. Prospective studies need to
confirm and refine these findings.
