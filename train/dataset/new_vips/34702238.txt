BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Western Australian 
government imposed multiple restrictions that impacted daily life activities and 
the social life. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of COVID-19
lockdown on the community's physical, mental and psychosocial health.
METHODS: Approximately 2 months after a three-month lockdown, a cross-sectional
study was opened to Western Australian adults for an 8-week period (25th August -
21 October 2020). Participants competed a 25-min questionnaire adapted from the
Western Australia Health and Wellbeing Surveillance system. Participants provided
information on their socio-demographic status, lifestyle behaviours, mental
health, and psychosocial health during and post-lockdown. Open-ended questions
explored key issues in greater detail. Changes between the lockdown and
post-lockdown period were assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test and One-Sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Normal tests as appropriate. Sex differences were examined
using the Mann-Whitney U test. A content analysis approach examined responses to 
the open-ended questions with frequencies and variations in responses determined 
using Chi-Square tests.
RESULTS: A total of 547 complete responses were obtained. Compared to
post-lockdown period, lockdown was associated with a significantly lower levels
of physical activity, poorer mental well-being and sense of control over one's
life, and a higher level of loneliness. Similarly, during lockdown, there was a
significantly higher consumption of junk food, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks
but no change in fruit and vegetable intake. Participants recalled health
campaigns on hand washing and social distancing and there was a retrospective
view that more timely and informative campaigns on physical activity, nutrition
and mental well-being should have been available during lockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: While advice on infection control measures were appropriately
provided, there is a need for concurrent health promotional information to help
combat the changes in physical, mental and psychosocial well-being observed
during quarantine to prevent negative health consequences in the community even
if there are minimal effects of the pandemic itself.
