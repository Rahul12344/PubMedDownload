BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with several cutaneous manifestations,
including chilbain-like lesions, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and
maculopapular lesions. Dermatoses may be directly linked to the viral infection
or also represent a consequence of systemic therapies administrated for COVID-19.
A potential role of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering the reactivation of other viruses,
such as HHV-6, HHV-7 and Epstein-Barr virus has been hypothesized.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand and hypothesize possible pathogenetic
correlations of COVID-19 with other dermatological conditions.
METHODS: We report the case of an 83-year-old woman hospitalized in a nursing
home for several years. On November 2020, the patient had been diagnosed with
SARS-CoV-2 infection, with repeated positive swabs until January 2021. After a
month, new-onset asymptomatic cutaneous purplish macular lesions and violaceous
patches occurred bilaterally on the feet.
RESULTS: An incisional cutaneous biopsy and the histological examination of the
plantar lesion revealed the diagnosis of Kaposi Sarcoma.
CONCLUSION: We report a unique case of new-onset bilateral Kaposi's sarcoma
following COVID-19, speculating on a possible role of SARS-CoV-2 in the
reactivation of human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) infection.
