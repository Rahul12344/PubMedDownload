AIMS: Adenoviruses that have CNGRCVSGCAGRC peptide inserted into fiber (AdFNGR)
or hexon (AdHNGR) protein, respectively, showed increased transduction of
endothelial cells. In this study we investigated if cysteines within the
CNGRCVSGCAGRC sequence inserted into Ad5 fiber or hexon protein form disulfide
bond(s) and whether they play a role in retargeting potential of AdFNGR and
AdHNGR.
METHODS: Transduction efficiency of adenoviruses was done by counting infected
cells under the microscope. Adenovirus attachment and internalization were
measured by qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the expression of CD13 and 
integrins. Gene knockdown was achieved by transfection of small interfering RNA. 
Mass spectrometry was used for determining disulfide bonds in adenovirus fiber
and hexon protein. Molecular modeling was use to predict interaction of
CNGRCVSGCAGRC peptide and CD13.
KEY FINDINGS: AdFNGR and AdHNGR attach better to CD13 and/or αvβ3
integrin-positive cells than Adwt. Reducing disulfide bonds using DTT decreased
transduction efficiency and attachment of both AdFNGR and AdHNGR. Cysteins from
CNGRCVSGCAGRC peptide within AdHNGR do not form disulfide bonds. Knockdown of
αvβ3 integrin reduced increased transduction efficiency of both AdFNGR and
AdHNGR, while CD13 knockdown had no effect, indicating that retargeting
properties of these viruses rely mainly on αvβ3 integrin expression.
SIGNIFICANCE: Insertion site of NGR-containing peptides as well as NGR flanking
residues are critical for receptor binding affinity/specificity and transduction 
efficiency of NGR retargeted adenoviral vectors.
