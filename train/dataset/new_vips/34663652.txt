OBJECTIVES: The global COVID-19 pandemic produced large-scale health and economic
complications. Older people and those with comorbidities are particularly
vulnerable to this virus, with nursing homes and long term care facilities (LTCF)
experiencing significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19
outbreaks. The aim of this rapid systematic review was to investigate measures
implemented in LTCF to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and their effect on
morbidity and mortality of residents, staff and visitors.
SETTING: Long-term care facilities.
PARTICIPANTS: Residents, staff and visitors of facilities.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL,
Cochrane Databases and repositories and MedRXiv prepublished database) were
systematically searched from inception to 27 July 2020 to identify studies
reporting assessment of interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in
nursing homes among residents, staff or visitors. Outcome measures include
facility characteristics, morbidity data, case fatalities and transmission rates.
Due to study quality and heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: The search yielded 1414 articles, with 38 studies included. Reported
interventions include mass testing, use of personal protective equipment, symptom
screening, visitor restrictions, hand hygiene and droplet/contact precautions,
and resident cohorting. Prevalence rates ranged from 1.2% to 85.4% in residents
and 0.6% to 62.6% in staff. Mortality rates ranged from 5.3% to 55.3% in
residents.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel evidence in this review details the impact of facility size,
availability of staff and practices of operating between multiple facilities, and
for-profit status of facilities as factors contributing to the size and number of
COVID-19 outbreaks. No causative relationships can be determined; however, this
review provides evidence of interventions that reduce transmission of COVID-19 in
LTCF.
