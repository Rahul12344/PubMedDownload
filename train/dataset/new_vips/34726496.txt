After emerging in China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread worldwide, and as of
mid-2021, it remains a significant threat globally. Only a few coronaviruses are 
known to infect humans, and only two cause infections similar in severity to
SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, a species
closely related to SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus, which emerged in 2012. Unlike the current pandemic,
previous epidemics were controlled rapidly through public health measures, but
the body of research investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle
East respiratory syndrome has proven valuable for identifying approaches to
treating and preventing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Building on
this research, the medical and scientific communities have responded rapidly to
the COVID-19 crisis and identified many candidate therapeutics. The approaches
used to identify candidates fall into four main categories: adaptation of
clinical approaches to diseases with related pathologies, adaptation based on
virological properties, adaptation based on host response, and data-driven
identification (ID) of candidates based on physical properties or on
pharmacological compendia. To date, a small number of therapeutics have already
been authorized by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), while most remain under investigation. The scale of the COVID-19 crisis
offers a rare opportunity to collect data on the effects of candidate
therapeutics. This information provides insight not only into the management of
coronavirus diseases but also into the relative success of different approaches
to identifying candidate therapeutics against an emerging disease. IMPORTANCE The
COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving crisis. With the worldwide scientific
community shifting focus onto the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, a large number
of possible pharmaceutical approaches for treatment and prevention have been
proposed. What was known about each of these potential interventions evolved
rapidly throughout 2020 and 2021. This fast-paced area of research provides
important insight into how the ongoing pandemic can be managed and also
demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to rapidly understand a
virus and match its characteristics with existing or novel pharmaceuticals. As
illustrated by the continued threat of viral epidemics during the current
millennium, a rapid and strategic response to emerging viral threats can save
lives. In this review, we explore how different modes of identifying candidate
therapeutics have borne out during COVID-19.
