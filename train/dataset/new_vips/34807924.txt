Rhinoviruses (RV) are a major cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) 
in children, with high genotypic diversity in different regions. However, RV type
diversity remains unknown in several regions of the world. In this study, the
genetic variability of the frequently circulating RV types in Northern Tunisia
was investigated, using phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses with a specific
focus on the most frequent RV types: RV-A101 and RV-C45. This study concerned 13 
RV types frequently circulating in Northern Tunisia. They were obtained from
respiratory samples collected in 271 pediatric SARI cases, between September 2015
and November 2017. A total of 37 RV VP4-VP2 sequences, selected among a total of 
49 generated sequences, was compared to 359 sequences from different regions of
the world. Evolutionary analysis of RV-A101 and RV-C45 showed high genetic
relationship between different Tunisian strains and Malaysian strains. RV-A101
and C45 progenitor viruses' dates were estimated in 1981 and 1995, respectively. 
Since the early 2000s, the two types had a wide spread throughout the world.
Phylogenetic analyses of other frequently circulating strains showed significant 
homology of Tunisian strains from the same epidemic period, in contrast with
earlier strains. The genetic relatedness of RV-A101 and RV-C45 might result from 
an introduction of viruses from different clades followed by local dissemination 
rather than a local persistence of an endemic clades along seasons. International
traffic may play a key role in the spread of RV-A101, RV-C45, and other RVs.
