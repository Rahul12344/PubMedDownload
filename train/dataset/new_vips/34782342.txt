OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread morbidity and
mortality with the consequences expected to be felt for many years. Significant
variation exists in the care even of similar patients with COVID-19, including
treatment practices within and between institutions. Outcome measures vary among 
clinical trials on the same therapies. Understanding which therapies are of most 
value is not possible unless consensus can be reached on which outcomes are most 
important to measure. Furthermore, consensus on the most important outcomes may
enable patients to monitor and track their care, and may help providers to
improve the care they offer through quality improvement. To develop a
standardised minimum set of outcomes for clinical care, the International
Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) assembled a working group (WG)
of 28 volunteers, including health professionals, patients and patient
representatives.
DESIGN: A list of outcomes important to patients and professionals was generated 
from a systematic review of the published literature using the MEDLINE database, 
from review of outcomes being measured in ongoing clinical trials, from a survey 
distributed to patients and patient networks, and from previously published ICHOM
standard sets in other disease areas. Using an online-modified Delphi process,
the WG selected outcomes of greatest importance.
RESULTS: The outcomes considered by the WG to be most important were selected and
categorised into five domains: (1) functional status and quality of life, (2)
mental functioning, (3) social functioning, (4) clinical outcomes and (5)
symptoms. The WG identified demographic and clinical variables for use as
case-mix risk adjusters. These included baseline demographics, clinical factors
and treatment-related factors.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of these consensus recommendations could help
institutions to monitor, compare and improve the quality and delivery of care to 
patients with COVID-19. Their consistent definition and collection could also
broaden the implementation of more patient-centric clinical outcomes research.
