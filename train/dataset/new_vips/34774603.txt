SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells after binding through its spike glycoprotein to the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Soluble ACE2 ectodomains bind
and neutralize the virus, yet their short in vivo half-live limits their
therapeutic use. This limitation can be overcome by fusing the fragment
crystallizable (Fc) part of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the ACE2 ectodomain, 
but this bears the risk of Fc-receptor activation and antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity. Here, we describe optimized ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion constructs that
avoid Fc-receptor activation, preserve the desired ACE2 enzymatic activity and
show promising pharmaceutical properties. The engineered ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion
proteins neutralize the original SARS-CoV, pandemic SARS-CoV-2 as well as the
rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 alpha, beta and delta variants of concern.
Importantly, these variants of concern are inhibited at picomolar concentrations 
proving that ACE2-IgG4 maintains - in contrast to therapeutic antibodies - its
full antiviral potential. Thus, ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins are promising
candidate anti-antivirals to combat the current and future pandemics.
