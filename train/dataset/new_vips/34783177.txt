Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a validated target for molecular
diagnostics and targeted radionuclide therapy. Our purpose was to evaluate PSMA
expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and
hepatic adenoma (HCA); investigate the genetic pathways in HCC associated with
PSMA expression; and evaluate HCC detection rate with 68 Ga-PSMA-11 positron
emission tomography (PET). In phase 1, PSMA immunohistochemistry (IHC) on HCC
(n = 148), CCA (n = 111), and HCA (n = 78) was scored. In a subset (n = 30),
messenger RNA (mRNA) data from the Cancer Genome Atlas HCC RNA sequencing were
correlated with PSMA expression. In phase 2, 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET was prospectively 
performed in patients with treatment-naïve HCC on a digital PET scanner using
cyclotron-produced 68 Ga. Uptake was graded qualitatively and semi-quantitatively
using standard metrics. On IHC, PSMA expression was significantly higher in HCC
compared with CCA and HCA (P < 0.0001); 91% of HCCs (n = 134) expressed PSMA,
which principally localized to tumor-associated neovasculature. Higher tumor
grade was associated with PSMA expression (P = 0.012) but there was no
association with tumor size (P = 0.14), fibrosis (P = 0.35), cirrhosis
(P = 0.74), hepatitis B virus (P = 0.31), or hepatitis C virus (P = 0.15).
Overall survival tended to be longer in patients without versus with PSMA
expression (median overall survival: 4.2 vs. 1.9 years; P = 0.273). FGF14
(fibroblast growth factor 14) mRNA expression correlated positively (rho = 0.70; 
P = 1.70 × 10-5 ) and MAD1L1 (Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD1)
correlated negatively with PSMA expression (rho = -0.753; P = 1.58 × 10-6 ). Of
the 190 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 31 patients with 39 HCC
lesions completed PET; 64% (n = 25) lesions had pronounced 68 Ga-PSMA-11
standardized uptake value: SUVmax (median [range] 9.2 [4.9-28.4]), SUVmean 4.7
(2.4-12.7), and tumor-to-liver background ratio 2 (1.1-11). Conclusion: Ex vivo
expression of PSMA in neovasculature of HCC translates to marked tumor avidity on
68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET, which suggests that PSMA has the potential as a theranostic
target in patients with HCC.
