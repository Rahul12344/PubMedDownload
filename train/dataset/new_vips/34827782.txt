Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of acute hepatitis in humans
worldwide. In industrialised countries, most infections are caused by the
zoonotic genotype 3. The main reservoir was found in pigs, with fattening pigs as
the main shedders. The aim of this study was to establish a screening tool to
detect HEV in pig farms. HEV-positive samples were sequenced using Sanger
sequencing. First, different sample materials, including floor swabs, slurry,
dust swabs and faeces were tested for HEV. Floor swabs turned out to give the
best results and, in the form of sock swabs, were used for the screening of Swiss
pig herds. A total of 138 pig farms were tested, with a focus on fattening pigs. 
Overall, 81 farms (58.8%) were HEV positive. Most sequences belonged to subtype
3h, in which they formed a specific cluster (Swiss cluster). In addition, subtype
3l and two unassigned sequences were detected. As a conclusion, sock swabs were
found to be a helpful tool to screen pig herds for HEV and establish a sequence
collection that may enable molecular epidemiology and support outbreak
investigation and prevention.
