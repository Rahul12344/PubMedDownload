The plant pathogen Exobasidium gracile, which belongs to the basidiomycetous
genus Exobasidium, can lead to swollen and thicker leaves of C. oleifera. To our 
knowledge, there have been no reports of mycoviruses infecting Exobasidium
gracile. This study characterized three mycoviruses coinfecting the plant
pathogen Exobasidium gracile strain Z-1. Based on phylogenetic and genomic
analyses, E. gracile strain Z-1 was infected two putative Totiviruses designated 
Exobasidium gracile Totivirus 1 (EgTV1) and Exobasidium gracile Totivirus 2
(EgTV2) and a putative Zybavirus of the family Amalgaviridae defined Exobasidium 
gracile Zybavirus 1 (EgZV1). Similar to the genomic organization of other
Totiviruses, the EgTV1 and EgTV2 genomes are composed of one dsRNA segment that
exhibits two large ORFs encoding a CP (capsid protein) and an RdRp (RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase), respectively. Moreover, EgTV1 and EgTV2 genomes with a candidate
-1 slippery heptamer sequence were discovered between CP and RdRp, respectively. 
Similar to other Zybaviruses of the family Amalgaviridae, the EgZV1 genome is
composed of one dsRNA segment that contains two large ORFs encoding an unknown
protein and an RdRp. In addition, the EgZV1 genome has a candidate +1 slippery
heptamer sequence between an unknown protein and RdRp.
