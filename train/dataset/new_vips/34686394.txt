BACKGROUND: Between September 2017 and June 2019, an outbreak of hepatitis A
virus (HAV) occurred in Louisville, Kentucky, resulting in 501 cases and 6
deaths, predominantly among persons who experience homelessness or who use drugs 
(PEH/PWUD). The critical vaccination threshold (Vc) required to achieve herd
immunity in this population is unknown. We investigated Vc and vaccination impact
using epidemic modeling.
METHODS: To determine which population subgroups had high infection risks, we
employed a technique based on comparing the proportion of cases arising before
and after the epidemic peak, across subgroups. We also developed a dynamic
deterministic model of HAV transmission among PEH/PWUD to estimate the basic
reproduction number (R0), herd immunity threshold, Vc and the effect of timing of
the vaccination intervention on epidemic and economic outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 501 confirmed or probable cases, 385 (76.8%) were among PEH/PWUD.
Among PEH/PWUD and within the general population, homelessness was a significant 
risk factor for infection in the initial stages of the outbreak (odds ratios for 
homeless versus not homeless: 2.62; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-4.25 for
PEH/PWUD and 2.39; 95% CI: 1.51-3.78 for all detected cases). Our estimate for R0
ranges between 2.85 and 3.54, corresponding to an estimate of 69% (95% CI: 65-72)
for herd immunity threshold and 76% (95% CI: 72%-80%) for Vc, assuming a vaccine 
with 90% efficacy. The observed vaccination program was estimated to have averted
30 hospitalizations (95% CI: 19-43), associated with over US$490 000 (95% CI:
$310 000-700 000) in hospitalization cost. Greater impact was observed with
earlier and faster vaccination implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage of at least 77% is likely required to prevent
outbreaks of HAV among PEH/PWUD in Louisville, assuming a 90% vaccine efficacy.
Proactive hepatitis A vaccination programs among PEH/PWUD will maximize health
and economic benefits of these programs and reduce the likelihood of another
outbreak.
