T-VEC, a HSV-1 derived oncolytic virus, is approved for the treatment of advanced
melanoma. The mechanisms that underly the systemic anti-tumor effect that is seen
following intratumoral injection have not yet been studied but are likely to be
mediated by myeloid dendritic cells (myDC) that initiate an adaptive immune
response. In this study we could demonstrate that T-VEC is non-toxic for human
myDC. T-VEC and a T-VEC oncolysate of melanoma cell lines were able to mature
human myDC. myDC were able to take up lysed melanoma cells and cross-present
melanoma-derived tumor antigens to antigen-specific T cells. Our results support 
the possible role of myDC as mediators of an adaptive anti-tumor effect and
intratumoral co-administration of T-VEC plus autologous myDC could be a
complementary treatment option. A clinical trial that investigates this
hypothesis is currently ongoing.
