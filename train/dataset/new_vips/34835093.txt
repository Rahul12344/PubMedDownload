Rabies is a lethal zoonotic disease caused by lyssaviruses, such as rabies virus 
(RABV), that results in nearly 100% mortality once clinical symptoms appear.
There are no curable drugs available yet. RABV contains five structural proteins 
that play an important role in viral replication, transcription, infection, and
immune escape mechanisms. In the past decade, progress has been made in research 
on the pathogenicity of RABV, which plays an important role in the creation of
new recombinant RABV vaccines by reverse genetic manipulation. Here, we review
the latest advances on the interaction between RABV proteins in the infected host
and the applied development of rabies vaccines by using a fully operational RABV 
reverse genetics system. This article provides a background for more in-depth
research on the pathogenic mechanism of RABV and the development of therapeutic
drugs and new biologics.
