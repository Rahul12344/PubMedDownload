More than one and a half years have elapsed since the commencement of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the world is struggling to
contain it. Being caused by a previously unknown virus, in the initial period,
there had been an extreme paucity of knowledge about the disease mechanisms,
which hampered preventive and therapeutic measures against COVID-19. In an
endeavor to understand the pathogenic mechanisms, extensive experimental studies 
have been conducted across the globe involving cell culture-based experiments,
human tissue organoids, and animal models, targeted to various aspects of the
disease, viz., viral properties, tissue tropism and organ-specific pathogenesis, 
involvement of physiological systems, and the human immune response against the
infection. The vastly accumulated scientific knowledge on all aspects of COVID-19
has currently changed the scenario from great despair to hope. Even though
spectacular progress has been made in all of these aspects, multiple knowledge
gaps are remaining that need to be addressed in future studies. Moreover,
multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants
have emerged across the globe since the onset of the first COVID-19 wave, with
seemingly greater transmissibility/virulence and immune escape capabilities than 
the wild-type strain. In this review, we narrate the progress made since the
commencement of the pandemic regarding the knowledge on COVID-19 mechanisms in
the human body, including virus-host interactions, pulmonary and other systemic
manifestations, immunological dysregulations, complications, host-specific
vulnerability, and long-term health consequences in the survivors. Additionally, 
we provide a brief review of the current evidence explaining molecular mechanisms
imparting greater transmissibility and virulence and immune escape capabilities
to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
