Background: Approximately 45% of individuals diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer
(CRC) also possess KRAS mutations. One developing therapeutic method for this
disease is reovirus treatment. It is theorized that reovirus treatment on
patients with KRAS mutated CRC cells would be successful due to the virus' innate
oncolytic properties [1]. Reovirus, a stable form of nonenveloped double-stranded
RNA, causes minor infections in humans under normal circumstances. However, when 
the virus encounters KRAS mutated cells, it has the potential to lyse them [2].
While this method of treatment to CRC has shown signs of success, we are still
some ways from universal administration of reovirus as a treatment. This review
seeks to utilize various studies, as well as our original research data, to
investigate reovirus as an efficient method of treatment, with a focus on select 
growth, apoptotic and RAS-related genes, and their effectiveness of mitigating
KRAS mutated CRC post reovirus treatment. Furthermore, the review highlights
transcriptome analysis as an effective tool to examine these genes and their
activity. It has been shown that reovirus treatment induces apoptosis and
mitigates growth related gene activity.
Conclusions: This review confirms the novelty of our findings on the efficacy of 
reovirus in CRC treatment. The study that this review article discusses concluded
that 10 apoptotic and lymphocyte-related genes were found to be upregulated and 6
angiogenesis and Ras-related genes were found to be downregulated post reovirus
treatment. These findings enforce the notion that reovirus could be used as a
novel treatment for KRAS mutated CRC.
