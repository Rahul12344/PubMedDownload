Recently, the widespread occurrence of Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV),
genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae, which causes a mosaic disease in cassava
(Manihot esculenta Crantz) in South-East Asia have, become a serious economic
issue. Since cassava is propagated through vegetative cuttings, a rapid virus
diagnostic method is crucial for generating virus-free planting materials. In
this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using six
primers was developed and validated for the rapid detection of SLCMV in cassava
leaves. This SLCMV assay had a detection sensitivity that was up to 10,000 times 
higher than that of the conventional polymerase chain reaction assay and can
detect the virus from symptomless stem cutting, which is a potential
long-distance spreader of the virus. Furthermore, a practical LAMP protocol using
stable dried reagents from a commercial kit was established so that the assay
could be performed in the field by incubating the reactions in water at 60-65 °C 
instead of using a thermal cycler. The primer sequences and the LAMP protocol
described here should be useful for the rapid and sensitive on-site detection of 
SLCMV.
