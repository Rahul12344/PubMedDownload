Background: Restrictions on routine dental procedures involving aerosols during
COVID-19 have resulted in a significant increase in the suffering of pediatric
patients.
Aim: The study reported the alternative measures followed in our department using
SDF during the COVID era when routine elective dental procedures were prohibited.
Materials and Methods: The retrospective data of patients aged 2-13 years with
carious molar teeth who were treated with silver diamine fluoride without (Group 
1) or with (Group 2) caries excavation were collected.
Results: One thousand and seventy-two patients (646 males and 426 females) with
2459 carious molar were treated. On follow-up assessment at 3 months, 28 teeth in
Group 1 and 21 teeth in Group 2 showed progression of carious lesion using
International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II criteria). Out of 
these failure cases, 32 (1.8%) teeth were primary and 17 (2.5%) were permanent.
Complete relief in sensitivity/pain on stimulation was reported in 2381 teeth
(96.83%), whereas in 78 (3.17%) teeth, mild sensitivity/pain on stimulation was
reported. The average time consumed during treatment per tooth in Group 1 was
5.04 min and in Group 2 was 5.78 min.
Conclusion: SDF application can be carried out as a nonaerosol-generating
procedure and is a simple technique for children and clinicians.
