The thymus is the main lymphoid organ that regulates the immune and endocrine
systems by controlling thymic cell proliferation and differentiation. The gland
is a primary lymphoid organ responsible for generating mature T cells into CD4+
or CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells, contributing to cellular immunity.
Regarding humoral immunity, the thymic plasma cells almost exclusively secrete
IgG1 and IgG3, the two main complement-fixing effector IgG subclasses. Deformity 
in the thymus can lead to inflammatory diseases. Hassall's corpuscles' epithelial
lining produces thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which induces differentiation of
CDs thymocytes into regulatory T cells within the thymus medulla. Thymic B
lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins and immunoregulating hormones, including
thymosin. Modulation in T cell and naive T cells decrement due to thymus
deformity induce alteration in the secretion of various inflammatory factors,
resulting in multiple diseases. Influenza virus activates thymic CD4+ CD8+
thymocytes and a large amount of IFNγ. IFNs limit virus spread, enhance
macrophages' phagocytosis, and promote the natural killer cell restriction
activity against infected cells. Th2 lymphocytes-produced cytokine IL-4 can bind 
to antiviral INFγ, decreasing the cell susceptibility and downregulating viral
receptors. COVID-19 epitopes (S, M, and N proteins) with ≥90% identity to the
SARS-CoV sequence have been predicted. These epitopes trigger immunity for
antibodies production. Boosting the immune system by improving thymus function
can be a therapeutic strategy for preventing virus-related diseases. This review 
aims to summarize the endocrine-immunoregulatory functions of the thymus and the 
underlying mechanisms in the prevention of COVID-19.
