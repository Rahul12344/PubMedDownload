The COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gap regarding access to educational
opportunities, which was included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
This descriptive, quantitative study aims to examine the communication strategies
employed by secondary schools in Spain during the lockdown, as well as to analyse
the co-responsibility of the educational process between schools and families. An
ad hoc questionnaire (GIESBAFCOV-19) was designed and implemented to gather
information. The results show that, in most cases, mothers were responsible for
assisting and supervising their children's homework as persons in charge of
education-related matters. Additionally, before the lockdown was put in place,
about half of the participating families received information from the educative 
centres regarding the disease and sanitary measures. Once the lockdown took
place, families put the focus on their children's schoolwork, not without
difficulties in academic and digital literacy. In general, the families were
satisfied with the communication established with the educational centres. The
present study has raised the necessity to improve communication between centres
and families and to reflect on the tools and systems used for its exchange.
Consequently, it seems that information and digital competences should be
promoted to guarantee an equalitarian education for all.
