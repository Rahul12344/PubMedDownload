Mosquito-borne viruses of the Flavivirus genus (Flaviviridae family) pose an
ongoing threat to global public health. For example, dengue, Japanese
encephalitis, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses are transmitted by
infected mosquitoes and cause severe and fatal diseases in humans. The means by
which mosquito-borne flaviviruses establish persistent infection in mosquitoes
and cause disease in humans are complex and depend upon a myriad of virus-host
interactions, such as those of the innate immune system, which are the main focus
of our review. This review also covers the different strategies utilized by
mosquito-borne flaviviruses to antagonize the innate immune response in humans
and mosquitoes. Given the lack of antiviral therapeutics for mosquito-borne
flaviviruses, improving our understanding of these virus-immune interactions
could lead to new antiviral therapies and strategies for developing refractory
vectors incapable of transmitting these viruses, and can also provide insights
into determinants of viral tropism that influence virus emergence into new
species.
