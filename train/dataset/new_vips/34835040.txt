Human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which are small, double-stranded, circular DNA
viruses infecting human epithelial cells, are associated with various benign and 
malignant lesions of mucosa and skin. Intensive research on the oncogenic
potential of HPVs started in the 1970s and spread across Europe, including
Croatia, and worldwide. Nowadays, the causative role of a subset of oncogenic or 
high-risk (HR) HPV types, led by HPV-16 and HPV-18, of different anogenital and
head and neck cancers is well accepted. Two major viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, 
are directly involved in the development of HPV-related malignancies by targeting
synergistically various cellular pathways involved in the regulation of cell
cycle control, apoptosis, and cell polarity control networks as well as host
immune response. This review is aimed at describing the key elements in
HPV-related carcinogenesis and the advances in cancer prevention with reference
to past and on-going research in Croatia.
