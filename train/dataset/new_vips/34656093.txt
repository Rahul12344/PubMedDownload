BACKGROUND: As patients with cervical cancer and precancerous lesions can be
diagnosed at early stage and live longer, it is imperative to understand their
health-related quality of life so that better cancer-related policies could be
promoted and reasonable distribution of limited resources could be implemented.
We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming 
Medical University to assess the health-related quality of life in our targeted
population. Due to the characteristics of Yunnan nationality, our study
population includes both Han people and ethnic minorities.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2019 to December
2020, and 300 patients were selected, who were initially diagnosed with cervical 
cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) pathologically. EQ-5D
questionnaire was used to evaluate their quality of life.
RESULTS: Patients in Han and ethnic minorities showed good comparability. EQ-5D
VAS score was statistically significant between Han and ethnic minorities (mean, 
85.42 vs. 81.01; P<0.05). EQ-5D utility score was slightly different but without 
statistical significance between the two groups (mean, 0.959 vs. 0.932; P>0.05). 
Nationality, economic trouble, menopause status and participation of China
National Cervical Cancer Screening Program (CNCCSP) are influencing factors of
HRQoL among women with cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Besides, we also
found low awareness in the CNCCSP and human papilloma virus vaccine, as well as
low participation in the national screening program.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study imply that the difference of HRQoL does
exist between Han people and ethnic minorities with cervical cancer and
precancerous lesions. Health providers and health-related departments need to
invest more health and financial resources to expand the awareness and
participation of the screening project. More efforts should be made in
underdeveloped minority areas to assure the accessibility of health resources and
interventions. To mitigate economic trouble caused by the diseases, more equal
insurance reimbursement should be suggested and implemented in people with or
without employee insurance.
