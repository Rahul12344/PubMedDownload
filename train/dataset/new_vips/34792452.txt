Much is already written on how the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Canada's frail,
elderly population - the impact of the global pandemic turned the decades-long
challenges within our nation's long-term care sector into daily news coverage.
While no commission or report can ever begin to relieve the pain and suffering of
individuals who lived through the pandemic, healthcare leaders owe it to all to
respond to the urgent call for action to re-envision elder care for the future.
The time to act is now. Our leaders need to collaborate and connect with our
seniors to take quick action on their recommendations. Our leaders need to be
nimble and creative; they need to work together across the system to rethink how 
aging seniors can be supported and change the system, its funding models and,
ultimately, how we value and care for our aging population now and into the
future.
