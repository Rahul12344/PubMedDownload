Dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease that has become endemic and a global
threat in many countries with no effective antiviral drug available currently.
This study showed that flavonoids: silymarin and baicalein could inhibit the
dengue virus in vitro and were well tolerated in Vero cells with a half-maximum
cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 749.70 µg/mL and 271.03 µg/mL, respectively.
Silymarin and baicalein exerted virucidal effects against DENV-3, with a
selective index (SI) of 10.87 and 21.34, respectively. Baicalein showed a better 
inhibition of intracellular DENV-3 progeny with a SI of 7.82 compared to
silymarin. Baicalein effectively blocked DENV-3 attachment (95.59%) to the Vero
cells, while silymarin prevented the viral entry (72.46%) into the cells, thus
reducing viral infectivity. Both flavonoids showed promising antiviral activity
against all four dengue serotypes. The in silico molecular docking showed that
silymarin could bind to the viral envelope (E) protein with a binding affinity of
- 8.5 kcal/mol and form hydrogen bonds with the amino acids GLN120, TRP229,
ASN89, and THR223 of the E protein. Overall, this study showed that silymarin and
baicalein exhibited potential anti-DENV activity and could serve as promising
antiviral agents for further development against dengue infection.
