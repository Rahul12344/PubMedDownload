OBJECTIVE: To analyze adverse events following immunization (AEFI) against
SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil.
METHODS: Epidemiological, descriptive study, with data from e-SUS Notifica (e-SUS
Notification) in the state of Minas Gerais from January 20 to March 5, 2021. All 
suspected cases of AEFI of the covid-19 vaccine in the state were analyzed,
totaling 7,305 cases. In this study, we verified the possible correlation between
AEFI and the possible immunobiological administered causalities. The variables
analyzed for AEFI cases were the immunobiological agent administered (AstraZeneca
or Coronavac), the type of event, the evolution of the case, and the time in days
since the administration of the immunobiological agent and the onset of symptoms 
and causality. The incidence rate (IT) was calculated for 100,000 doses applied.
RESULTS: The occurrence of AEFI as a result of the covid-19 vaccine was frequent 
(TI: 777.12) in the state. However, only 3% were classified as a severe AEFI,
with a 20.85 IT, and 4.71% of them evolved to deaths (8.19 deaths per 100,000
doses applied). Among the deaths analyzed, 84.4% were classified as preexisting
conditions caused by factors other than vaccines. Regarding non-serious AEFI,
1.11% occurred by immunization errors (TI: 8.62 EI for every 100 thousand doses
applied).
CONCLUSION: This work encourages the discussion about the importance of recording
AEFI related to covid-19 vaccines, demonstrating its safety for the population.
