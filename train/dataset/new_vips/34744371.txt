RNA interference (RNAi) is a universal phenomenon of RNA silencing or gene
silencing with broader implications in important physiological and developmental 
processes of most eukaryotes, including plants. Small RNA (sRNA) are the critical
drivers of the RNAi machinery that ensures down-regulation of the target genes in
a homology-dependent manner and includes small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and
micro RNAs (miRNAs). Plant researchers across the globe have exploited the
powerful technique of RNAi to execute targeted suppression of desired genes in
important crop plants, with an intent to improve crop protection against
pathogens and pests for sustainable crop production. Biotic stresses cause severe
losses to the agricultural productivity leading to food insecurity for future
generations. RNAi has majorly contributed towards the development of designer
crops that are resilient towards the various biotic stresses such as viruses,
bacteria, fungi, insect pests, and nematodes. This review summarizes the recent
progress made in the RNAi-mediated strategies against these biotic stresses,
along with new insights on the future directions in research involving RNAi for
crop protection.
