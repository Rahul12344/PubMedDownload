Background: Contradictive results about the direct role of C5a/C5aR1 axis in
different cancer cells have been reported. The direct effect of C5a on human
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and the underlying mechanism are not clear. The 
aim of this study is to investigate the role of C5a/C5aR1 axis in RCC cells and
its working mechanism.
Methods: RCC cells were infected with lentivirus Lenti-C5a, which was designed to
over-express secretory C5a in the cells, or directly treated with recombinant
C5a, the influence of these treatments in the cells and the underlying mechanism 
were explored.
Results: Transfection of RCC cells with Lenti-C5a markedly increased the
production of C5a and significantly increased the proliferation, migration, and
invasion of RCC cells, but direct addition of C5a to the cell culture medium had 
no such effects though it indeed induced a transient intracellular calcium rise. 
RCC cells were found to express carboxypeptidase D and M, which reportedly to
inactivate C5a. Also, the RCC cells stably transfected with Lenti-C5a produced
larger transgrafted tumors in nude mice compared with the non-transfected or
control virus transfected cells. In addition, over-expression of C5a
significantly increased the expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as
the phosphorylated JNK level. Furthermore, the effect of C5a over-expression on
RCC cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion could be blocked by Stattic, a 
STAT3-specific inhibitor.
Conclusion: Chronic over-activation of C5a/C5aR1 axis could directly increase RCC
cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion and thus contribute directly to the
progression of the disease. Over-activation of STAT3 pathway is among the
underlying mechanism.
