Olfactory loss has been identified as one of the common symptoms related to
COVID-19 infection. Although olfactory loss is recognized, our understanding of
both the extent of loss and time to olfactory recovery following infection is
less well known. Similarly, knowledge of potential impactful patient factors and 
therapies that influence olfactory recovery is desirable but is not overtly clear
in the literature. Our systematic review sought to fill this knowledge gap. We
included studies that: involved either an observational or an interventional
design that reported data on patients with olfactory dysfunction due to Reverse
Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19 infection;
and reported data regarding olfactory recovery measured by an objective olfactory
test, Likert scale and/or visual analog scale (VAS). The study methods were
determined a priori and registered in PROSPERO (Registration Number
CRD42020204354). An information specialist searched Medline, Embase, LitCovid and
the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2021, and two reviewers
were involved in all aspects of study selection and data collection. After
screening 2788 citations, a total of 44 studies of assorted observational designs
were included. Patients had undergone objective COVID-19 testing, and most were
adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Olfactory recovery was found to
occur as early as 7 days, with most patients recovering olfaction within 30 days.
Few studies included prolonged follow-up to 6 months or longer duration. Poor
olfaction at initial presentation was associated with poor recovery rates. Only a
small number of studies assessed olfactory retraining and steroid therapy.
Additional trials are underway.
