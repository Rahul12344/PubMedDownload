OBJECTIVES: To estimate levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among working-age
adults with disabilities in the United Kingdom.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of data collected on a nationally representative
sample of 10,114 respondents aged 16-64 years.
RESULTS: The adjusted relative risk for hesitancy among respondents with a
disability was 0.92 (95% CI 0.67-1.27). There were stronger associations between 
gender and hesitancy and ethnic status and hesitancy among participants with a
disability. The most common reasons cited by people with disabilities who were
hesitant were: concern about the future effects of the vaccine, not trusting
vaccines and concern about the side effects of vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The higher rates of vaccine hesitancy among women with disabilities 
and among people from minority ethnic groups with disabilities are concerning.
