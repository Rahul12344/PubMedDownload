OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cells are main effector cells in
the control of HBV infection and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is suggested
to be a critical factor in the impaired immune response, a hallmark of chronic
HBV infection. In addition to HBsAg, other viral markers such as hepatitis B
core-related antigen (HBcrAg) are available, but their potential association with
HBV-specific immune responses is not defined yet, which will be important if
these markers are used for patient stratification for novel therapies aimed at
functional HBV cure.
DESIGN: We analysed T cell responses in 92 patients with hepatitis B e antigen
negative chronic HBV infection with different HBsAg and HBcrAg levels.
Overlapping peptides were used for in vitro response analyses (n=57), and HBV
core18-specific and polymerase (pol)455-specific CD8+ T cells were assessed in
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02 patients (n=35). In addition, in vitro
responsiveness to anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) was
investigated.
RESULTS: HBV-specific T cell responses were not affected by HBsAg levels, but
rather by age and CD4+ T cell responses were highest in patients with low HBcrAg 
levels. The phenotypes and functionality of HBV core18-specific and
pol455-specific CD8+ T cells differed, but HBsAg and HBcrAg levels did not affect
their profiles. Blocking with anti-PD-L1 could restore HBV-specific T cells, but 
the effect was significantly higher in T cells isolated from patients with low
HBsAg and in particular low HBcrAg.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that age and HBcrAg rather than HBsAg, are
associated with HBV-specific T cell responses. Finally, very low antigen levels
indicated by HBsAg and in particular HBcrAg may influence T cell response to
checkpoint inhibition.
