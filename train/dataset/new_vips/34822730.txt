The main purpose of micro-organisms elimination from the air and surfaces is to
ensure microbiological safety in health care facilities or food production
plants. Currently, many disinfection methods are used, both physical, chemical
and, increasingly, biological. Scientists seek new solutions with high
antimicrobial effectiveness (especially against the drug-resistant strains of
bacteria), low production and operating costs, and, above all, the safety of
patients and food consumers. The limitation of the methods used so far is
primarily the micro-organisms acquire the resistance, mainly to antimicrobial
agents. One of the new and alternative methods of disinfection is radiant
catalytic ionization (RCI). RCI is an active method of air and surface
purification. The technology proved high efficiency against viruses,
Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and fungi, both in the air and on surfaces 
(planktonic forms and biofilm). RCI has many advantages as well as some minor
limitations. This overview summarizes the current knowledge about RCI technology.
