With recurring waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, a dilemma facing public health
leadership is whether to provide public advice that is medically optimal (e.g.,
most protective against infection if followed), but unlikely to be adhered to, or
advice that is less protective but is more likely to be followed. To provide
insight about this dilemma, we examined and quantified public perceptions about
the tradeoff between (a) the stand-alone value of health behavior advice, and (b)
the advice's adherence likelihood. In a series of studies about preference for
public health leadership advice, we asked 1061 participants to choose between (5)
strict advice that is medically optimal if adhered to but which is less likely to
be broadly followed, and (2) relaxed advice, which is less medically effective
but more likely to gain adherence-given varying infection expectancies.
Participants' preference was consistent with risk aversion. Offering an informed 
choice alternative that shifts volition to advice recipients only strengthened
risk aversion, but also demonstrated that informed choice was preferred as much
or more than the risk-averse strict advice.
