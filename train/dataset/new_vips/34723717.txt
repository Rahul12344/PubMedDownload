Does the Length of Time to Complete an Online Program Matter?

Gonzalez Y, Hansen BR, Seale JP, Finnell DS.

Health care providers are challenged to meet the simultaneous demands of
delivering clinical care and acquiring new information, especially in the context
of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the opioid epidemic, and concurrent
escalation in alcohol and other drug use. To address the gap in knowledge related
to substance use, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment
(SBIRT), a self-paced online educational program, was developed and delivered to 
169 learners. Posttest knowledge scores increased for all learners and did not
differ based on their pace of completion. Results indicated that this module
provides a means for busy clinicians to increase their ability to manage
substance use, even if their learning occurs in multiple sessions interrupted by 
other pressing demands. Future iterations of this course could further enhance
clinical competency by addition of an online clinical simulation component. [J
