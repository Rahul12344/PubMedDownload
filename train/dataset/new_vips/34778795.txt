Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is increasing worldwide. One
solution to this crisis is bacteriophage therapy, a treatment that harnesses
naturally occurring bacterial viruses to invade and lyse antimicrobial resistant 
bacterial hosts. In Gram-negative hosts, a by-product of bacteriophage production
is bacterial endotoxin, which can cause serious immune reactions in vivo.
Purification methods using organic solvent extraction can remove endotoxin in
bacteriophage lysates. In this study, we investigate a method for removal of
endotoxin from 16 high-titer Klebsiella pneumoniae lysates by extraction with
1-dodecanol, 1-octanol, dodecane, or decane. In these experiments, treatment with
either 1-dodecanol or 1-octanol resulted in removal of 104-105 endotoxin
units/mL. Recovery of bacteriophage in lysates treated with dodecanol without
dialysis was >90%, and residual dodecanol was low (10-1500â€‰ppm). Overall these
results suggest that organic solvent extraction using 1-dodecanol is effective at
removing bacterial endotoxin, maintaining bacteriophage titer, and reducing
solvent contamination in 16 K. pneumoniae bacteriophage lysates.
