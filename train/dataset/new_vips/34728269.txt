Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a serious disease affecting feedlot 
cattle in China and likely other places worldwide. Bovine viral diarrhea virus
(BVDV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) are principally responsible 
for causing BRDC, and are a major strain to the industrial economy. Eradication
of these viruses/disease requires swift viral identification and treatment.
Hence, this study established a fast and easy procedure of BVDV and BPIV3
identification that employs reverse transcription recombinase polymerase
amplification (RT-RPA) and lateral flow dipstick (LFD), and uses primers and
lateral flow (LF) probe targeting the 5'-UTR gene of BVDV and phosphoprotein P
gene of BPIV3, respectively. Our assay was able to successfully amplify BVDV and 
BPIV3 RNA within 25 min at 35 °C using RT-RPA, with products visible on the LFD
within 5 min at room temperature (RT). The lowest detection limits were 50 RNA
molecules for BVDV and 34 RNA molecules for BPIV3 per reaction. We also
demonstrated that the established dual RT-RPA LFD assay was precise and targeted,
harboring excellent potential to become an onsite molecular diagnostic tool in
the detection of BVDV and BPIV3. This method can detect BVDV (Pestivirus A, B)
and BPIV3, and exhibit no cross-reaction with other viruses like the classical
swine fever virus (CSFV) and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV). The 
assay performance was further assessed with clinical samples, and demonstrated
good performance in comparison to real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the
RT-RPA LFD assay was comparitively rapid and required minimal training.
