Exploring reliable and highly-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antibody diagnosis by
point-of-care (POC) manner, holds great public health significance for extensive 
COVID-19 screening and controlling. Unfortunately, the currently applied gold
based lateral flow immunoassay (GLFIA) may expose both false-negative and
false-positive interpretations owing to the sensitivity and specificity
limitations, which may cause significant risk and waste of public resources for
large population screening. To simultaneously overcome the drawbacks of GLFIA, a 
novel fluorescent LFIA based on signal amplification and dual-antigen sandwich
structure was established with largely improved sensitivity and specificity. The 
compact three-dimensional incorporation of hydrophobic quantum dots within
dendritic affinity templates and multilayer surface derivation guaranteed a high 
and robust fluorescence of single label, which lowered the false negative rate of
GLFIA prominently. A dual-antigen sandwich structure using labeled/immobilized
SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain antigen for capturing total human
SARS-CoV-2 antibody was developed, instead of general indirect antibody capturing
approach, to reduce the false positive rate of GLFIA. Over 300 cases of COVID-19 
negative and 97 cases of COVID-19 positive samples, the current assay revealed a 
100% sensitivity and 100% specificity confirmed by both polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), compared with the considerable
misinterpretation cases by currently applied GLFIA. The quantitative results
verified by receiver operating characteristic curve and other statistical
analysis indicated a well-distinguished positive/negative sample groups. The
proposed strategy is highly sensitive towards low concentrated SARS-CoV-2
antibody serums and highly specific towards serums from COVID-19 negative persons
and patients infected by other viruses.
