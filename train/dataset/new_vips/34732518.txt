OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experience of people who continue to be unwell
after acute COVID-19, often referred to as 'long COVID', both in terms of their
symptoms and their interactions with healthcare.
DESIGN: We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of responses to a survey accessed
through a UK online post-COVID-19 support and information hub, between April and 
December 2020, about people's experiences after having acute COVID-19.
PARTICIPANTS: 3290 respondents, 78% female, 92.1% white ethnicity and median age 
range 45-54 years; 12.7% had been hospitalised. 494(16.5%) completed the survey
between 4 and 8 weeks of the onset of their symptoms, 641(21.4%) between 8 and 12
weeks and 1865 (62.1%) >12 weeks after.
RESULTS: The ongoing symptoms most frequently reported were: breathing problems
(92.1%), fatigue (83.3%), muscle weakness or joint stiffness (50.6%), sleep
disturbances (46.2%), problems with mental abilities (45.9%), changes in mood,
including anxiety and depression (43.1%) and cough (42.3%). Symptoms did not
appear to be related to the severity of the acute illness or to the presence of
pre-existing medical conditions. Analysis of free-text responses revealed three
main themes: (1) experience of living with COVID-19: physical and psychological
symptoms that fluctuate unpredictably; (2) interactions with healthcare that were
unsatisfactory; (3) implications for the future: their own condition, society and
the healthcare system, and the need for research CONCLUSION: Consideration of
patient perspectives and experiences will assist in the planning of services to
address problems persisting in people who remain symptomatic after the acute
phase of COVID-19.
