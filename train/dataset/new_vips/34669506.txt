The public health burden caused by influenza virus infections is not adequately
addressed with existing vaccines and antivirals. Identifying approaches that
interfere with human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses remains a
pressing need. The importance of neuraminidase (NA) activity for the replication 
and spread of influenza viruses led us to investigate whether broadly reactive
human anti-NA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could affect airborne transmission of 
the virus using the guinea pig model. In that model, infection with recent
influenza virus clinical isolates resulted in 100% transmission from inoculated
donors to recipients in an airborne transmission setting. Anti-NA mAbs were
administered either to the inoculated animals on days 1, 2, and 4 after infection
or to the na√Øve contacts on days 2 and 4 after donor infection. Administration of
NA-1G01, a broadly cross-reactive anti-NA mAb, to either the donor or recipient
reduced transmission of the A/New York City/PV02669/2019 (H1N1) and A/New York
City/PV01148/2018 (H3N2) viruses. Administration of 1000-3C05, an anti-N1 mAb, to
either the donor or recipient reduced transmission of A/New York
City/PV02669/2019 (H1N1) virus but did not reduce transmission of A/New York
City/PV01148 (H3N2) virus. Conversely, 229-2C06, an anti-N2 mAb, reduced
transmission of A/New York City/PV01148 (H3N2) but did not impact transmission of
A/New York City/PV02669/2019 (H1N1) virus. Our work demonstrates that anti-NA
mAbs could be further developed into prophylactic or therapeutic agents to
prevent influenza virus transmission and thus control viral spread. Importance
The burden of influenza remains substantial despite unremitting efforts to reduce
the magnitude of seasonal influenza epidemics and prepare for pandemics. While
vaccination remains the mainstay of these efforts, current vaccines are designed 
to stimulate an immune response against the viral hemagglutinin. Interest in the 
role immunity against neuraminidase plays in influenza virus infection and
transmission has recently surged. Human antibodies that bind broadly to
neuraminidases of diverse influenza viruses and protect mice against lethal viral
challenge have previously been characterized. Here, we show that three such
antibodies inhibit the neuraminidase activity of recent isolates and reduce their
airborne transmission in a guinea pig model. In addition to contributing to the
accumulating support for incorporating neuraminidase as a vaccine antigen, these 
findings also demonstrate the potential of direct administration of
anti-neuraminidase antibodies to individuals infected with influenza virus and to
individuals for post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the spread of influenza.
