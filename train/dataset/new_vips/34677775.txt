After more than a year from the first confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19)
disease, the role of meteorological factors in the transmission of the virus
still needs to be correctly determined. In this scenario of deep uncertainty, the
present study aims to investigate the effects of temperature and relative
humidity on daily new cases of COVID-19. For this purpose, the COVID-19's
development of infection in fourteen Algerian cities characterized by different
climatic conditions, during the period from April 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020,
has been investigated. A detailed time series analysis along with linear
regression was used to state a possible correlation among some climate's factor
variability (temperature and relative humidity) and daily new confirmed cases of 
COVID-19. The results showed a weak correlation between daily new cases of
COVID-19 and meteorological factors throughout the selected regions. In addition,
we concluded that the COVID-19 could fit to high or low values of temperature and
relative humidity, and other factors not climates could affect the spreading of
the virus like demography and human contact. So, after the discovery of the
vaccine and before vaccination of 70% of the world's population, living with the 
virus has become an inevitable reality, and it is mandatory to apply the sanitary
procedures to slow down the COVID-19 transmission.
