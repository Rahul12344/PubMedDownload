OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 vaccines have developed quickly, and vaccination programs
have started in most countries to fight the pandemic. The aging population is
vulnerable to different diseases, also including the COVID-19. A high death rate 
of COVID-19 was noted from the vulnerable aging population. A present scenario
regarding COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination program foraging adults had been
discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper reviews the current status and future
projections till 2050 of the aging population worldwide. It also discusses the
immunosenescence and inflammaging issues facing elderly adults and how it affects
the vaccinations such as influenza, pneumococcal, and herpes zoster.
RESULTS: This paper recommends clinical trials for all approved COVID-19 vaccines
targeting the elderly adult population and to project a plan to develop a
next-generation COVID-19 vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: The review has mapped the COVID-19 vaccination status from the
developed and developing countries for the elderly population. Finally,
strategies to vaccinate all elderly adults globally against COVID-19 to enhance
longevity has been suggested.
