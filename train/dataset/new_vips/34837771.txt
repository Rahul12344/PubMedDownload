Recent progress in the design of cationic lipids and polymers has successfully
translated nucleic acid drugs into clinical applications, such as the treatment
of liver diseases and the prevention of virus infection. Small or large libraries
of delivery molecules have been used to find the key chemical structures to
protect nucleic acids from nucleases in the extracellular milieu and to
facilitate the endosomal escape after endocytosis. This review introduces three
essential design parameters (i.e., acid dissociation constant, hydrophobicity,
and biodegradability) to develop synthetic molecules for nucleic acid delivery.
The significance and mechanism of each parameter are described based on the
results obtained from in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Other design parameters
were then discussed to create the next generation of delivery molecules for
future nucleic acid therapeutics.
