Cladribine (CLAD) is a lymphodepleting agent approved for active relapsing
multiple sclerosis (MS). The impact of CLAD on the adaptive humoral immune system
has not sufficiently been studied. This study aimed to assess the influence of
CLAD treatment on specific antibody titers to common pathogens. We included 18 MS
patients treated with CLAD. Serum IgG antibody levels to measles, mumps, rubella,
hepatitis B and varicella zoster virus (VZV), as well as diphtheria and tetanus
toxins, were measured prior to the initiation of treatment and at 12 and 24
months after first CLAD administration. Moreover, specimens were longitudinally
analyzed regarding absolute blood concentrations of IgG and main lymphocyte
subsets. No reduction in antibody levels against measles, mumps, rubella, VZV,
hepatitis B, diphtheria toxin and tetanus toxin associated with CLAD treatment
was observed. Loss of seroprotection occurred in <1%. We found no significant
impact of CLAD on absolute serum IgG levels. Absolute lymphocyte counts were
significantly reduced at the end of each treatment year (p < 0.00001 and p <
0.000001). This study suggests that CLAD does not interfere with the pre-existing
humoral immunologic memory in terms of pathogen-specific antibody titers.
