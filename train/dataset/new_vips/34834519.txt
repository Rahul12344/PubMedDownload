Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic
agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Besides virus
intrinsic characteristics, the host genetic makeup is predicted to account for
the extreme clinical heterogeneity of the disease, which is characterized, among 
other manifestations, by a derangement of hemostasis associated with
thromboembolic events. To date, large-scale studies confirmed that genetic
predisposition plays a role in COVID-19 severity, pinpointing several
susceptibility genes, often characterized by immunologic functions. With these
premises, we performed an association study of common variants in 32 hemostatic
genes with COVID-19 severity. We investigated 49,845 single-nucleotide
polymorphism in a cohort of 332 Italian severe COVID-19 patients and 1668
controls from the general population. The study was conducted engaging a class of
students attending the second year of the MEDTEC school (a six-year program, held
in collaboration between Humanitas University and the Politecnico of Milan,
allowing students to gain an MD in Medicine and a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical
Engineering). Thanks to their willingness to participate in the fight against the
pandemic, we evidenced several suggestive hits (p < 0.001), involving the PROC,
MTHFR, MTR, ADAMTS13, and THBS2 genes (top signal in PROC: chr2:127192625:G:A, OR
= 2.23, 95%CI = 1.50-3.34, p = 8.77 × 10-5). The top signals in PROC, MTHFR, MTR,
ADAMTS13 were instrumental for the construction of a polygenic risk score, whose 
distribution was significantly different between cases and controls (p = 1.62 ×
10-8 for difference in median levels). Finally, a meta-analysis performed using
data from the Regeneron database confirmed the contribution of the MTHFR variant 
chr1:11753033:G:A to the predisposition to severe COVID-19 (pooled OR = 1.21,
95%CI = 1.09-1.33, p = 4.34 × 10-14 in the weighted analysis).
