BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether children receiving
immunosuppressive therapies for neuroimmunologic disorders had (1) increased
susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection or to develop more severe forms of
COVID-19; (2) increased relapses or autoimmune complications if infected; and (3)
changes in health care delivery during the pandemic.
METHODS: Patients with and without immunosuppressive treatment were recruited to 
participate in a retrospective survey evaluating the period from March 14, 2020, 
to March 30, 2021. Demographics, clinical features, type of immunosuppressive
treatment, suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the patients or cohabitants, and
changes in care delivery were recorded.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three children were included: 84 (55%) female, median 
age 13 years (interquartile range [8-16] years), 79 (52%) on immunosuppressive
treatment. COVID-19 was suspected or confirmed in 17 (11%) (all mild), with a
frequency similar in patients with and without immunosuppressive treatment (11/79
[14%] vs 6/74 [8%], p = 0.3085). The frequency of neurologic relapses was similar
in patients with (18%) and without (21%) COVID-19. Factors associated with
COVID-19 included having cohabitants with COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and lower blood
levels of vitamin D (p = 0.039). Return to face-to-face schooling or mask type
did not influence the risk of infection, although 43(28%) children had contact
with a classmate with COVID-19. Clinic visits changed from face to face to remote
for 120 (79%) patients; 110 (92%) were satisfied with the change.
DISCUSSION: In this cohort of children with neuroimmunologic disorders, the
frequency of COVID-19 was low and not affected by immunosuppressive therapies.
The main risk factors for developing COVID-19 were having cohabitants with
COVID-19 and low vitamin D levels.
