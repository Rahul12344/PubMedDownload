BACKGROUND: Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL), strongly related to
human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, is more prevalent among men who have sex
with men (MSM). However, no such data are available for Pakistan yet, and neither
HPV vaccination nor anal-cytology screening is implemented in Pakistan. The
purpose of this first ever study was to assess the prevalence of HPV-related anal
cytological abnormalities among MSM and transgender women living with and without
HIV infection in Pakistan.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from March 2016 to November 2017 at
sexual health centers run by the Perwaaz Trust and the National AIDS Control
Program in Karachi. The study enrolled MSM and transgender women aged
greater-than-and-equal-to-18-years who reported anal sex in the preceding
6 months. We collected two anal samples for liquid-based cytology and HPV type
testing by PCR, and socio-demographic and behavioral data were collected through 
face-to face interviews. ASIL and its associations with biological and behavioral
risk factors were analyzed through Cox regression for prevalence ratios (PR) and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Out of 271 qualifying participants, 79% were MSM and 21% transgender
women. The mean age was 28.8 (± 8) years. Almost 35% (93/271) of the study
population had ASIL detected, ASIL was significantly more common among
participants living with HIV than in HIV negative ((50/118) 42.4%; vs. (43/153)
28.1%) (p ≤ 0.001). Among ASIL, 66% (61/93) had low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 3.6% (3/93) had high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The overall, HPV16 positivity was 35.5% (33/93)
among all abnormal anal lesions and all 3 HSIL were HPV16 positive, however,
HPV16 positivity could show its association with ASIL detection in univariate
model only (PRcrude: 2.11(1.39-3.18)). Moreover, any HR-HPV type (PR 3.04; 95% CI
1.75-5.26), concurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) (2.13; (1.28-3.55))
and HIV + /HPV + coinfection (1.75; (1.07-2.88)) remained independently
associated with ASIL in the multivariate model.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal anal cytology among MSM and transgender is prevalent enough
to consider optimal screening regimens. Further studies are required to see if
periodic anal cytology can be made part of HIV care and treatment programs among 
MSM in Pakistan.
