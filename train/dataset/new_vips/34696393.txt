Understanding how perturbations to trophic interactions influence virus-host
dynamics is essential in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss and the continued 
emergence of RNA viruses and their associated zoonoses. Herein, we investigated
the role of predator exclusion on rodent communities and the seroprevalence of
hantaviruses within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayú (RNBM), which is a
protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest (IAF). In the IAF, two sympatric
rodent reservoirs, Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, harbor Jaborá and 
Juquitiba hantavirus (JABV, JUQV), respectively. In this study, we employed two
complementary methods for predator exclusion: comprehensive fencing and
trapping/removal. The goal of exclusion was to preclude the influence of
predation on small mammals on the sampling grids and thereby potentially reduce
rodent mortality. Following baseline sampling on three grid pairs with different 
habitats, we closed the grids and began predator removal. By sampling three
habitat types, we controlled for habitat-specific effects, which is important for
hantavirus-reservoir dynamics in neotropical ecosystems. Our six-month predator
exclusion experiment revealed that the exclusion of terrestrial mammalian
predators had little influence on the rodent community or the population dynamics
of A. montensis and O. nigripes. Instead, fluctuations in species diversity and
species abundances were influenced by sampling session and forest degradation.
These results suggest that seasonality and landscape composition play dominant
roles in the prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent reservoirs in the IAF
ecosystem.
