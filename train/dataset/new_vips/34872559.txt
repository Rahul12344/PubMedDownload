BACKGROUND: From 2 January to 14 February 2021, a local outbreak of COVID-19
occurred in Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province, with a population
of 10 million. We analyzed the characteristics of the local outbreak of COVID-19 
in Shijiazhuang and evaluated the effects of serial interventions.
METHODS: Publicly available data, which included age, sex, date of diagnosis, and
other patient information, were used to analyze the epidemiological
characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shijiazhuang. The maximum likelihood 
method and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method were used to estimate the serial
interval and incubation period, respectively. The impact of incubation period and
different interventions were simulated using a well-fitted SEIR+q model.
RESULTS: From 2 January to 14 February 2021, there were 869 patients with
symptomatic COVID-19 in Shijiazhuang, and most cases (89.6%) were confirmed
before 20 January. Overall, 40.2% of the cases were male, 16.3% were aged 0 to 19
years, and 21.9% were initially diagnosed as asymptomatic but then became
symptomatic. The estimated incubation period was 11.6 days (95% CI 10.6, 12.7
days) and the estimated serial interval was 6.6 days (0.025th, 0.975th: 0.6, 20.0
days). The results of the SEIR+q model indicated that a longer incubation period 
led to a longer epidemic period. If the comprehensive quarantine measures were
reduced by 10%, then the nucleic acid testing would need to increase by 20% or
more to minimize the cumulative number of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Incubation period was longer than serial interval suggested that
more secondary transmission may occur before symptoms onset. The long incubation 
period made it necessary to extend the isolation period to control the outbreak. 
Timely contact tracing and implementation of a centralized quarantine quickly
contained this epidemic in Shijiazhuang. Large-scale nucleic acid testing also
helped to identify cases and reduce virus transmission.
