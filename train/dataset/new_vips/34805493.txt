Lack of noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to reliably detect early
allograft injury poses a major hindrance to long-term allograft survival in
pediatric kidney transplant recipients.Methods: Validating Injury to the Renal
Transplant Using Urinary Signatures Children's Study, a North American
multicenter prospective cohort study of pediatric kidney transplant recipients,
aims to validate urinary cell mRNA and metabolite profiles that were diagnostic
and prognostic of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) 
in adult kidney transplant recipients in Clinical Trials in Organ
Transplantation-4. Specifically, we are investigating: (1) whether a urinary cell
mRNA 3-gene signature (18S-normalized CD3ε, CXCL10 mRNA, and 18S ribosomal RNA)
discriminates biopsies with versus without ACR, (2) whether a combined metabolite
profile with the 3-gene signature increases sensitivity and specificity of
diagnosis and prognostication of ACR, and (3) whether BKV-VP1 mRNA levels in
urinary cells are diagnostic of BKVN and prognostic for allograft failure.
Results: To date, 204 subjects are enrolled, with 1405 urine samples, including
144 biopsy-associated samples. Among 424 urine samples processed for mRNA, the
median A260:280 ratio (RNA purity) was 1.91, comparable with Clinical Trials in
Organ Transplantation-4 (median 1.82). The quality control failure rate was 10%. 
Preliminary results from urine supernatant showed that our metabolomics platform 
successfully captured a broad array of metabolites. Clustering of pool samples
and overlay of samples from various batches demonstrated platform robustness. No 
study site effect was noted.
Conclusions: Multicenter efforts to ascertain urinary biomarkers in pediatric
kidney transplant recipients are feasible with high-quality control. Further
study will inform whether these signatures are discriminatory and predictive for 
rejection and infection.
