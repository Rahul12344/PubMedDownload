Background: The most severe cases of Coronavirus-Disease-2019 (COVID-19) develop 
into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It has been proposed that
oxygenation may be inhibited by extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the 
form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme,
Genentech) is recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I that acts as a mucolytic by
cleaving and degrading extracellular DNA. We performed a pilot study to evaluate 
the effects of dornase alfa in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19.
Methods: We performed a pilot, non-randomized, case-controlled clinical trial of 
inhaled dornase for patients who developed ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.
Results: Improvement in arterial oxygen saturation to inhaled fraction of oxygen 
ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was noted in the treatment group compared to control at day 2
(95% CI, 2.96 to 95.66, P-value = 0.038), as well as in static lung compliance at
days 3 through 5 (95% CI, 4.8 to 19.1 mL/cmH2O, 2.7 to 16.5 mL/cmH2O, and 5.3 to 
19.2 mL/cmH2O, respectively). These effects were not sustained at 14 days. A
reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) myeloperoxidase-DNA (DNA : MPO) 
complexes (95% CI, -14.7 to -1.32, P-value = 0.01) was observed after therapy
with dornase alfa.
Conclusion: Treatment with dornase alfa was associated with improved oxygenation 
and decreased DNA : MPO complexes in BALF. The positive effects, however, were
limited to the time of drug delivery. These data suggest that degradation of
extracellular DNA associated with NETs or other structures by inhaled dornase
alfa can be beneficial. We propose a more extensive clinical trial is warranted.
