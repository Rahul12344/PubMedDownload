Background: Trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine showed 95%
efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease; however, the trials excluded
immunocompromised patients (ICPs). We aim at analyzing antibody response in ICPs.
Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Sheba Medical Center,
Israel, between January and April 2020, in 1274 participants who received the
vaccine, including 1002 ICPs and 272 immunocompetent healthcare workers (HCWs).
Antibodies were measured two-four weeks after vaccination by SARS-CoV-2
anti-receptor binding domain IgG antibodies (RBD IgG) and pseudo-virus
neutralization assays. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to
identify factors associated with vaccine-induced antibody response. Adverse
events (AEs) were monitored.
Findings: RBD-IgG antibodies were detected in 154/156 (98.7%) of patients with
HIV, 75/90 (83.3%) with solid malignancies, 149/187 (79.7%) with myeloma, 83/111 
(74.8%) following hematopoietic stem cell transplants, 25/36 (69.4%) following
liver transplantation, 26/43 (60.5%) with myelodysplastic syndrome, 96/188
(51.0%) with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 50/110 (45.5%) 
following kidney transplantation, 15/80 (18.8%) following heart transplantation, 
and 269/272 (98.9%) in controls. There was a significant correlation r = 0.74
(95%CI 0.69,0.78) between RBD-binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies in all
groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR 
0.41,95%CI 0.30,0.57) and underlying immunosuppression (OR 0.02,95%CI 0.01,0.07) 
were significantly associated with a non-reactive response of IgG antibodies. HIV
patients showed a similar immunological response as healthy adults. The vaccine
was safe without any episodes of rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or
allergy. Immunocompetent HCWs experienced significantly more AEs than ICPs.
Interpretation: Antibody response to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was highly
variable among different ICPs; thus, individual recommendations should be
provided for the different immunosuppression states.
