Objective: This study focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Europe and
investigates public health response in severely hit countries.
Methods: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Oxford COVID-19
Government Response Tracker and Health System Response Monitor were referred. The
relationship between stringency index and COVID-19 cases, and between speed of
stringency implementation and growth of cases was examined using linear
regression.
Results: The case-fatality ratio (CFR) of Europe (2.35%) was higher than the
global CFR (2.2%). United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany
together, accounted for 61.15% of cases and 65.62% of deaths in Europe.
Significant relationship was observed between growth of COVID-19 cases and late
substantive stringency imposed by countries. Population aged 65 and above
(r = 0.9037, p < 0.01) and male population (r = 0.8701, p < 0.01) were
significantly and positively correlated with COVID-19 deaths. The public health
system of even big European countries encountered roadblocks, such as shortages
of healthcare resources and deferral of non-COVID-19 treatments while dealing
with the unprecedented pandemic.
Conclusion: Even big and richest European countries delayed the implementation of
non-pharmaceutical interventions which led to rapid virus transmission. The
pandemic has posed a reminder to make the public health system more resilient, as
epidemics and pandemics of this nature will continue to threaten in future as
well.
