BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, distancing measures
were enforced to reduce virus spread, which likely had an impact on the overall
mental health of the population.
AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of mental health outcomes (depression,
anxiety and insomnia), and associated risk factors, during a physical distancing 
period imposed in the first wave of COVID-19.
METHOD: During the first month of Portugal's state of emergency, an online survey
was created and disseminated through social media channels. Sociodemographic and 
clinical variables were assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Univariate
linear regressions were used to identify associations between the collected
variables and mental health outcomes. Multivariate regression analyses were
performed to identify independent risk factors for clinical outcomes, with
adjustment for potential confounders.
RESULTS: We analysed data from 1626 participants: a significant proportion showed
depression (30.2%), anxiety (53.1%) and insomnia (36.3%) symptoms. Multivariate
regression models showed that being male and working from home were protective
for all mental health outcomes analysed, whereas the perception of infection,
being under psychiatric care and taking medication were risk factors (P < 0.05). 
Days in isolation and being unemployed were risk factors for depression and
insomnia (P < 0.05). Younger age and being a student were risk factors for
depression, whereas being a healthcare professional was protective (P < 0.05).
Indirect contact with COVID-19 was a risk factor for anxiety (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related distancing measures were associated with high
levels of adverse mental health symptoms. Several risk factors were associated
with these symptoms, which highlight the importance of identifying vulnerable
groups during physical distancing periods.
