OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the field performance of a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) assay for
detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2, Treponema pallidum (T.
pallidum) and Haemophilus ducreyi (H. ducreyi) in genital ulcer disease (GUD)
specimens.
METHODS: GUD M-PCR was performed on 186 remnant specimens, previously collected
for HSV testing, by four public health laboratories (PHLs) and the Laboratory
Reference and Research Branch (LRRB) at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The results from the PHLs were compared with those of LRRB, which
served as the reference testing method, and percentage agreement was calculated.
RESULTS: HSV was detected in 31 of 52 (59.6%), 20 of 40 (50%), 43 of 44 (97.7%)
and 19 of 50 (38.0%) specimens from PHL1, PHL2, PHL3 and PHL4, respectively.
There were seven discrepant results for HSV, and the overall percent agreement
between the PHLs and the LRRB was 94%-100%, with a kappa value of 0.922, which
demonstrates high agreement. T. pallidum was identified in 7 of 51 (13.7%)
specimens from PHL1 with 94.1% agreement and in 2 of 40 (5.0%) specimens from
PHL2 with 100% agreement. The LRRB identified three additional T.
pallidum-positive specimens from PHL1. The kappa value (0.849) for T. pallidum
testing suggests good agreement. Consistent with the LRRB results, no T. pallidum
was detected in specimens from PHL3 and PHL4, and H. ducreyi was not detected at 
any of the study sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The GUD M-PCR assay performed well in four independent PHLs and 12
suspected syphilis cases were identified in this study. The M-PCR assay could
provide improved diagnostic options for GUD infections in state and local PHLs.
