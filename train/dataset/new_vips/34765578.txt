A rising concern is the COVID-19 pandemic effect on adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs) due to increased parental stress and social/physical isolation. These
pandemic effects are likely to be higher in already marginalized communities. The
objective of this ecological study was to examine the relationship between
COVID-19 cases and deaths, race/ethnicity, and the estimated number of adults
with ACEs using data from South Carolina (SC). COVID-19 reported cases and death 
data were obtained from the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control.
ACE data was used from the 2014-2016 SC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System. Census data were used to obtain county population data. To measure the
relationship between these variables, the Spearman rank-order correlation test
was used because the data distribution was non-normal. There was a moderate
relationship between the estimated number of adults with one or more ACEs and
deaths (ρ = 0.89) and race/ethnicity-specific COVID-19 case counts by county
(Black: ρ = 0.76; =White: ρ = 0.96; Hispanic: ρ = 0.89). Further, the Spearman
correlation test showed the strongest relationship between COVID-19 deaths and
race-ethnicity-specific county populations was with the Black adult population (ρ
= 0.90). Given the known link between existing health inequities and exposure to 
COVID-19, these results demonstrate that the current pandemic could have
unintended consequences on the well-being of children and caregivers. Response
efforts should consider promoting protective factors for children and families
and advocating for equitable policies and systems that serve children.
