Wearable sensors allow for portable, long-term health monitoring in natural
environments. Recently, there has been an increase in demand for technology that 
can reliably monitor respiration, which can be indicative of cardiac diseases,
asthma, and infection by respiratory viruses. However, to date, the most reliable
respiration monitoring system involves a tightly worn chest belt that is not
conducive to longitudinal monitoring. Herein, we report that accurate respiration
monitoring can be effected using a fabric-based humidity sensor mounted within a 
face mask. Our humidity sensor is created using cotton fabrics coated with a
persistently p-doped conjugated polymer,
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):chloride (PEDOT-Cl), using a previously reported
chemical vapor deposition process. The vapor-deposited polymer coating displays a
stable, rapid, and reversible change in conductivity with an increase in local
humidity, such as the humidity changes experienced within a face mask as the
wearer breathes. Thus, when integrated into a face mask, the PEDOT-Cl-coated
cotton humidity sensor is able to transduce breaths into an electrical signal.
The humidity sensor-incorporated face mask is able to differentiate between deep 
and shallow breathing, as well as breathing versus talking. The
sensor-incorporated face mask platform also functions both while walking and
sitting, providing equally high signal quality in both indoor and outdoor
contexts. Additionally, we show that the face mask can be worn for long periods
of time with a negligible decline in the signal quality.
