AIM: There is a crucial need for pharmacokinetic (PK) data of oral vinorelbine
(VNR) in pediatric population. The aim of this work was to assess the PK profile 
of orally administered VNR in children with recurrent/progressive primary
low-grade glioma (LGG).
METHODS: A multicentric, open-label, single-arm intervention phase II study was
conducted. Patients, aged between 6 and 18 years, with histologically confirmed
recurrent or progressive primary LGG or non-documented typical optic pathway
tumors, were included. PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis
using Phoenix WinNonlin® software (version 8.0, Certara, Inc.). The Influence of 
demographic and biological covariates on VNR PK parameters was investigated using
a multivariate linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: PK analysis included 36 patients with a median age (range) of 11 (6-17) 
years. Estimates of apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of
distribution (V/F), half-life (t1/2 ) and their between-subject variability (CV%)
at 60 mg.m-2 dose level, were 472 L.h-1 (51.8%), 7002 L (57.9%) and 10 h (21.0%),
respectively. Negligible accumulation of VNR between C1 and C2 was observed. CL/F
and V/F were found to increase with body surface area (BSA) (p = 0.004). Lower
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) levels were observed among children
in comparison to adults.
CONCLUSION: Higher doses may be necessary for children with LGG. BSA showed a
significant impact on VNR systemic exposure. We believe that our findings will
serve as a basis for further studies to better characterize the
concentration-response relationships of VNR among pediatric patients.
