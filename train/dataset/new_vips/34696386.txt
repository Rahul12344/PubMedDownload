The spatiotemporal patterns of spread of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses on a
countrywide scale are unclear in many tropical/subtropical regions mainly because
spatiotemporally representative sequence data are lacking. We isolated,
sequenced, and analyzed 383 A(H1N1)pdm09 viral genomes from hospitalized patients
between 2009 and 2018 from seven locations across Kenya. Using these genomes and 
contemporaneously sampled global sequences, we characterized the spread of the
virus in Kenya over several seasons using phylodynamic methods. The transmission 
dynamics of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Kenya were characterized by (i) multiple virus 
introductions into Kenya over the study period, although only a few of those
introductions instigated local seasonal epidemics that then established local
transmission clusters, (ii) persistence of transmission clusters over several
epidemic seasons across the country, (iii) seasonal fluctuations in effective
reproduction number (Re) associated with lower number of infections and seasonal 
fluctuations in relative genetic diversity after an initial rapid increase during
the early pandemic phase, which broadly corresponded to epidemic peaks in the
northern and southern hemispheres, (iv) high virus genetic diversity with greater
frequency of seasonal fluctuations in 2009-2011 and 2018 and low virus genetic
diversity with relatively weaker seasonal fluctuations in 2012-2017, and (v)
virus spread across Kenya. Considerable influenza virus diversity circulated
within Kenya, including persistent viral lineages that were unique to the
country, which may have been capable of dissemination to other continents through
a globally migrating virus population. Further knowledge of the viral lineages
that circulate within understudied low-to-middle-income tropical and subtropical 
regions is required to understand the full diversity and global ecology of
influenza viruses in humans and to inform vaccination strategies within these
regions.
