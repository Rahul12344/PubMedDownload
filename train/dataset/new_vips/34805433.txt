Initiation of human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
medications will also treat hepatitis B infection (HBV). The prevalence of
chronic HBV was 0.86% (n=41/4760) among enrollees in a provincial PrEP program in
British Columbia, Canada. Overall, 46.3% lacked follow-up HBV DNA monitoring,
underscoring the need for HBV-related education for PrEP prescribers.
