OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study is to evaluate the prognosis of pregnant women
having SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate whether there was a difference in
perinatal outcomes between pregnant women who had SARS-CoV-2 infection and those 
who did not.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted with
116 singleton pregnancies. Cases enrolling in the study were divided into two
groups. While those in the first group had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection
(n = 46) the second group consisted of healthy pregnant women (n = 70).
RESULTS: Emergency Cesarean section was performed on three SARS-CoV-2 infected
pregnancies (30, 33 and 34 gestational weeks). Intensive care unit admission was 
required for all three cases after delivery and two of them died. Among the
pregnancies that had an infection in the third trimester, 71.4% (n = 20) of them 
had delivery in 14 days after diagnosis and 17.4% (n = 8) of their newborns were 
followed up at newborn intensive care unit. Overall, only one newborn had a
positive swab test result for SARS-CoV-2. There was no statistically significant 
difference between groups regarding their delivery week (37.02 ± 5.85 vs
38.5 ± 2.33). Similarly, there was no significant difference between groups,
concerning mean age, parity, and birth weight (P = 0.707, P = 0.092, P = 0.334;
P < 0.05). Furthermore, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnancies
that were followed up as inpatient or outpatient with respect to the delivery
week and birth weight was not significant (p > 0.05). Also, APGAR 5 scores of
hospitalized women (9.3 ± 1.1) were found to be lower than the outpatient group
(9.8 ± 0.8) (P = 0.043; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: No significant difference was detected between groups in terms of the
delivery week, birth weight, and APGAR scores. The inpatient group was found to
have lower APGAR 5 scores.
