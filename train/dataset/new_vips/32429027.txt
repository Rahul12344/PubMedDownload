A study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV)
antibodies in the serum of precolostral calves born to BLV antibody positive
dams. Two Michigan dairy herds with breeding programs designed to increase milk
production were utilized in this study. The prevalence of seropositive cows was
32% and 94% in herds 1 and 2, respectively, and neither herd had experienced more
than four cases of lymphosarcoma in 10 years. One hundred and twenty-five calves 
and their dams were tested for antibody to BLV by the radioimmunoprecipitation
assay utilizing glycoprotein antigen. Three of 79 calves (3.8%) born to
seropositive dams were seropositive prior to colostral ingestion. None of 46
calves born to seronegative dams was seropositive at birth. The percentage of
calves born to seropositive dams that were seropositive at birth was 4.7% in herd
1 and 3.4% in herd 2. This is a much lower rate of in utero BLV exposure than
reported in previous studies utilizing a herd in which cows were bred for
susceptibility to lymphosarcoma. Therefore, in herds seeking to reduce the
prevalence of BLV seropositive animals, it should be possible to retain calves
from seropositive dams in greater numbers than previously expected.
