In several countries worldwide, the initial response to coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) has been heavily criticized by general public, media, and healthcare
professionals, as well as being an acrimonious topic in the political debate. The
present article elaborates on some aspects of the United Kingdom (UK) primary
reaction to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; specifically, from February to July 2020. The
fact that the UK showed the highest mortality rate in Western Europe following
the first wave of COVID-19 certainly has many contributing causes; each deserves 
an accurate analysis. We focused on three specific points that have been insofar 
not fully discussed in the UK and not very well known outside the British border:
clinical governance, access to hospital care or intensive care unit, and
implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The considerations herein
presented on these fundamental matters will likely contribute to a wider and
positive discussion on public health, in the context of an unprecedented crisis.
