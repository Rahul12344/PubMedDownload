ABSTRACT: In the spring of 1918, a virus swept across the world, killing
approximately 50 million people by the summer of 1919. My grandmother, Kathryn
("Katie") Ann Darmody-an Irish immigrant who settled in New York State in
1904-was among the nurses who responded to this pandemic, which became known as
the 1918 influenza pandemic (or, erroneously, the Spanish flu). Today, as the
world contends with the COVID-19 pandemic, my grandmother's experiences resonate 
with new meaning-a reminder of how, then as now, nurses have been at the
forefront of public health. Her story, transmitted across generations, is one I
now share with a new generation of nurses.
