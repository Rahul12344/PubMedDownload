Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective single negative chain RNA virus, as
its envelope protein synthesis is dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV). Studies
have consistently shown that coinfection of HBV and HDV is the most serious form 
of viral hepatitis, with accelerated progression to liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. About 74 million of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)
positive patients worldwide are also co-infected with HDV. Besides, patients with
intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual behavior are at higher risk of HDV
infection. Therapeutic schedules for HDV are limited, and relapse of HDV has been
observed after treatment with pegylated interferon alpha. To reduce the
transmission of HDV, all people infected with HBV should be screened for HDV. At 
present, several serological and molecular detection methods are widely used in
the diagnosis of HDV. However, due to the lack of international standards
diagnostic results from different laboratories are often not comparable.
Therefore, the true prevalence of HDV is still unclear. In this manuscript, we
have analyzed various factors influencing the estimation of HDV prevalence. We
have also discussed about the advantages and disadvantages of currently available
HDV laboratory diagnostic methods, in order to provide some ideas for improving
the detection of HDV.
