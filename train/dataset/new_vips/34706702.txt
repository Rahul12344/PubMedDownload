BACKGROUND: This paper is an empirical investigation that examines a path model
linking COVID-19 perceptions to organisational citizenship behaviour (OCBs) via
three mediators: job insecurity, burnout, and job satisfaction. The research
examines the path model invariance spanning Generations X, Y, and Z. Three
countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) were the focus of the study.
METHODS: The data was collected from a sample of employees in service companies
(n = 578). We used a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM)
to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that COVID-19 perceptions positively predict job
insecurity, which positively impacts burnout levels. Burnout negatively predicts 
job satisfaction. The findings established that job satisfaction positively
predicts OCBs. The mediation analysis determined that job insecurity, burnout and
job satisfaction convey the indirect effects of COVID-19 perceptions onto OCBs.
Finally, our hypothesised model is non-equivalent across Generations X, Y and Z. 
In that regard, our multi-group analysis revealed that the indirect effects of
COVID-19 perceptions on OCBs were only valid amongst younger generations, i.e.,
Generation Y and Generation Z. Specifically, younger generations are
substantially more vulnerable to the indirect effects of COVID-19 perceptions on 
their engagement in OCBs than Generation X whose job satisfaction blocks the
effects of COVID-19 perceptions on OCBs.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study extends our knowledge of workplace generational
differences in responding to the perceptions of crises or pandemics. It offers
evidence that suggests that burnout, job attitudes and organisational outcomes
change differently across generations in pandemic times.
