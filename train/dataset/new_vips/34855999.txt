BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis B vaccine has been included in the infant
immunization schedule since 1991 in the US. We aimed to assess its effectiveness 
against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its impact on mortality.
APPROACH & RESULTS: The study population was participants aged 6+ years with HBV 
vaccination history and an HBV serologic testing from National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2018. Participants aged 18+ years with linked 
mortality records from 1999-2014 were followed for mortality analysis.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to compute vaccine effectiveness (VE) 
overall, by year of birth, and age. Cox regression was used to estimate hazards
ratios (HRs) for all-cause, cancer-related, and cardiovascular-related mortality.
A total of 64107 participants were included in the main analysis with 29600
(40.7%) completed HBV vaccine (>=3 dose, vaccinated). The highest vaccination
uptake was found among those born after 1991 at 86.5%. Vaccinated participants
had higher prevalence of vaccine-induced immunity than unvaccinated (47.2% vs
7.4%). Among those born after 1991, VE was found at 58% (95% CI, 18%-79%) overall
and 85% for those aged >=20 years (mean age, 22), whereas no effect was found
among those born prior to 1990. HBV vaccination was associated with reduced risk 
of all-cause mortality (HR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90) and cancer-related mortality 
(HR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.58-1.00) but not for cardiovascular-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: In universal infant vaccination era, HBV vaccine showed substantial
effectiveness against HBV infection and maintained strong protection for 20
years. It was also associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cancer-related
mortality.
