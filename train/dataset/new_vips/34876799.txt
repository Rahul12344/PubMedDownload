The traumatic subjective distress and personal meaning in life were examined in
the context of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic sanitary crisis and home
lockdown.METHOD: A total of 543 participants answered an online survey that
included questions about the individual characteristics of the pandemic
experience, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the Personal Meaning
Profile-Brief.
RESULTS: Nearly all of life impaired areas, having the suspicion of being ill
with COVID-19, having lost a close person to this virus, and having been
accompanied during the lockdown were experiences associated with higher PTSD
symptoms. Posttraumatic symptomatology was inversely correlated with areas of
meaning in life. Lastly, a higher number of affected areas and a negative
subjective lockdown circumstance explained greater total PTSD symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Specific pandemic experiences and lockdown circumstances affected the
presence of posttraumatic symptoms. The personal meaning of life seems to be
involved in the process of less adverse traumatic consequences.
