Fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating, infectious neoplastic disease, is
rarely reported in endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii).
With this study, we describe FP and the associated chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5
(ChHV5) in Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the United States during
2006-2020. Analysis of 22 case reports of Kemp's ridley turtles with FP revealed 
that while the disease was mild in most cases, 54.5% were adult turtles, a
reproductively valuable age class whose survival is a priority for population
recovery. Of 51 blood samples from tumor-free turtles and 12 tumor samples from
turtles with FP, 7.8% and 91.7%, respectively, tested positive for ChHV5 DNA via 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Viral genome shotgun sequencing
and phylogenetic analysis of six tumor samples show that ChHV5 sequences in
Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic
cluster with ChHV5 sequences identified in green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead 
(Caretta caretta) sea turtles from Hawaii, the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, and
the Caribbean. Results suggest an interspecific, spatiotemporal spread of FP
among Kemp's ridley turtles in regions where the disease is enzootic. Although FP
is currently uncommon in this species, it remains a health concern due to its
uncertain pathogenesis and potential relationship with habitat degradation.
