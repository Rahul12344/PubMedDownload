Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the global
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Rapid identification and
isolation of infectious patients are critical methods to block COVID-19
transmission. Antigen tests can contribute to prompt identification of infectious
individuals. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase,
the Cochrane Library, and Biomed Central databases. Studies evaluating the
diagnostic accuracy of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 in community participants
were included. Only English-language articles were reviewed. We included eligible
studies that provided available data to construct a 2 Ã— 2 table on a per-patient 
basis. Overall sensitivity and specificity for antigen tests were generated using
a bivariate random-effects model. Eighteen studies with 34,865 participants were 
retrieved. The meta-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests generated a pooled
sensitivity of 0.82 and a pooled specificity of 1.00. A subgroup analysis of ten 
studies that reported outcomes for 5629 symptomatic participants generated a
pooled sensitivity of 0.87 and a pooled specificity of 1.00. Antigen tests might 
have higher sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in the
community and may be an effective tool to identify patients to be quarantined to 
prevent further SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
