Earthworms have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and are used
globally as an ecotoxicological standard test species. Studies of the earthworm
Eisenia fetida have shown that exposure to nanomaterials activates a primary
corona-response, which is covering the nanomaterial with native proteins, the
same response as to biological invaders such as a virus. We outline that the
earthworm Eisenia fetida is possibly immune to COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), and we describe the likely mechanisms of
highly receptor-specific pore-forming proteins (PFPs). A non-toxic version of
this protein is available, and we hypothesize that it is possible to use the
earthworm's PFPs based anti-viral mechanism as a therapeutic model for human
SARS-CoV-2 and other corona viruses. The proteins can be used as a drug, for
example, delivered with a nanoparticle in a similar way to the current COVID-19
vaccines. Obviously, careful consideration should be given to the potential risk 
of toxicity elicited by lysenin for in vivo usage. We aim to share this view to
activate its exploration by the wider scientific community while promoting a
potential therapeutic development.
