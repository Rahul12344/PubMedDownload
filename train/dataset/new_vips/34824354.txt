Wolbachia is a maternally transmitted bacterial symbiont that is estimated to
infect approximately half of arthropod species. In the laboratory it can increase
the resistance of insects to viral infection, but its effect on viruses in nature
is unknown. Here we report that in a natural population of Drosophila
melanogaster, individuals that are infected with Wolbachia are less likely to be 
infected by viruses. By characterising the virome by metagenomic sequencing and
then testing individual flies for infection, we found the protective effect of
Wolbachia was virus-specific, with the prevalence of infection being up to 15%
greater in Wolbachia-free flies. The antiviral effects of Wolbachia may
contribute to its extraordinary ecological success, and in nature the symbiont
may be an important component of the antiviral defences of insects.
