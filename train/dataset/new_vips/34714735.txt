Meeting the Green Health Challenge.

Reynolds P.

Given the urgency of our climate change problem, a trip to the hospital can be
more than just a bit disconcerting for what it reveals about waste. From
disposable blood pressure cuffs and one-use plastic medical gowns to powerful air
filtration systems that consume immense quantities of energy, waste seems rife.
Hospitals might argue that many of these measures are necessary to tamp down
hospital-acquired infections, and indeed the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) has required that hospitals dial up their air purification 
systems to battle COVID-19.
