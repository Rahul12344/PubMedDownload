PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted thousands of individuals' experience
of caregiving and grief. This qualitative study aimed to gain in-dept
understanding of family caregivers' lived experiences of caregiving and
bereavement in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Canada. The study 
also aimed at providing new insight about caregiving and bereavement by analysing
the metaphors family caregivers use to report their experiences.
METHODS: The design of this study was guided by an interpretative
phenomenological approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with twenty
bereaved family caregivers who had lost a loved one during the first waves of the
pandemic.
RESULTS: Results indicate that bereaved family caregivers lived and understood
their experience in terms of metaphoric cut-offs, obstructions and shockwaves.
These three metaphors represented the grief process and the bereaved's quest for 
social connection, narrative coherence and recognition.
CONCLUSION: By identifying the meaning of the bereaved's metaphors and the quest 
they reveal, our study underlines the singularity of pandemic grief and points to
the value and meaning of caregiving with regard to the grieving process.
