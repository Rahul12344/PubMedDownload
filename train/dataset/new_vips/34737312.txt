The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA
BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was
widely demonstrated. However, long term effectiveness is still unknown.
Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services
(MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of
breakthrough infection between June 1 and July 27, the date of analysis. After
controlling for potential confounders as age and comorbidities, we found a
significant 1.51 fold (95% CI, 1.38-1.66) increased risk for infection for early 
vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later that was similar across all ages
groups. The increased risk reached 2.26- fold (95% CI, 1.80-3.01) when comparing 
those who were vaccinated in January to those vaccinated in April. This
preliminary finding of vaccine waning as a factor of time from vaccince should
prompt further investigations into long-term protection against different
strains.
