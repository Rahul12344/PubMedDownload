BACKGROUND: Following the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 and decreased activity of
healthcare systems, relocation of resources, and the possible reluctance of
patients to seek medical help, colorectal cancer patients were exposed to
significant risks. Given that colon cancer is the third most common cancer and
the second deadliest cancer in the world, its timely diagnosis and treatment are 
necessary to reduce costs and improve quality of life and patient survival. The
aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the
diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive search performed on June 2021 in various
databases, including Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus. Keywords such as
"diagnosis," "treatment," "coronavirus disease-19," "COVID-19," "coronavirus
disease," "SARS-CoV-2 infection," "SARS-CoV-2," "2019-nCoV," "coronavirus, 2019
novel," "SARS-CoV-2 virus," severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"
"COVID-19," "COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19," "SARS coronavirus 2," "colorectal
neoplasm," and "colorectal cancer " was used individually or a combination of
these words. All retrieved articles were entered into a database on EndNote X7.
Then, studies were first selected by title and then by abstract, and at the end, 
full texts were investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 850 studies, 43 were identified as eligible. According to
studies, the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the number of diagnostic
procedures have decreased. Emergency visits due to obstruction or perforation of 
the large intestine or in advanced stages of cancer have increased, and a delay
in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer has reported from 5.4 to 26%. Treatment of 
colorectal cancer has also decreased significantly or has been delayed,
interrupted, or stopped. This reduction and delay have been observed in all
treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and long-term radiation therapy;
only cases of emergency surgery and short-term radiotherapy has increased. The
waiting time for hospitalization and the length of hospital stay after surgery
has been reported to be higher. Changes in patients' treatment plans and complete
to partial cessation of hospitals activities-that provided treatment
services-were reported.
CONCLUSION: According to the reduction in the diagnosis and treatment of
colorectal cancer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compensating for the reduction
and preventing the continuation of this declining trend, requires serious and
effective interventions to prevent its subsequent consequences, including
referrals of people with advanced stages and emergency conditions, increasing
treatment costs and reducing the quality of life and patients survival.
