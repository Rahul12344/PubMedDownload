BACKGROUND: There are emerging eosinophil-related considerations concerning viral
infections. The role of eosinophils has poorly been evaluated during Hantavirus
infection.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of eosinophilia
(defined as an eosinophil count above 500 cells/mm3) during haemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS) in a large cohort of patients, and to identify factors
associated with eosinophilia.
RESULTS: Among 387 patients hospitalized for HFRS, 98 (25.3%) had eosinophilia.
By univariate analysis, eosinophilia was significantly associated with more
severe thrombocytopenia, high C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count
and neutrophil count and lower nephrotoxic drug intake. As there was a
collinearity between white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, only
C-reactive protein level with platelet count and nephrotoxic drug intake were
entered in the multivariable analysis. Elevated C-reactive protein concentrations
remained independently associated with eosinophilia.
CONCLUSION: Eosinophilia during HFRS affects one quarter of patients, and
supports the role of eosinophils in antiviral immunity against hantavirus
infection.
