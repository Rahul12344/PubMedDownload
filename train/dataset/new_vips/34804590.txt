Ticks are important vector hosts of pathogens which cause human and animal
diseases worldwide. Diverse viruses have been discovered in ticks; however,
little is known about the ecological factors that affect the tick virome
composition and evolution. Herein, we employed RNA sequencing to study the virome
diversity of the Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus ticks
sampled in Hubei Province in China. Twelve RNA viruses with complete genomes were
identified, which belonged to six viral families: Flaviviridae, Matonaviridae,
Peribunyaviridae, Nairoviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. These viruses
showed great diversity in their genome organization and evolution, four of which 
were proposed to be novel species. The virome diversity and abundance of R.
microplus ticks fed on cattle were evidently high. Further ecological analyses
suggested that host species and feeding status may be key factors affecting the
tick virome structure. This study described a number of novel viral species and
variants from ticks and, more importantly, provided insights into the ecological 
factors shaping the virome structures of ticks, although it clearly warrants
further investigation.
