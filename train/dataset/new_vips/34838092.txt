BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest that Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is
important factor in carcinogenesis of breast tumors. This study' objective was to
analyze HPV prevalence in breast cancers of patients from south-central Poland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed based on archival paraffin
embebbed and formalin fixed blocks in the group of 383 patients with breast
cancer. HPV prevalence and its genotype were assessed, respectively by: nested
PCR (with two groups of primers: PGMY09/PGMY11 and GP5+/GP6+), quantitative PCR
(qPCR). Tumors were classified as HPV positive in case of at least one positive
result in nested PCR and positive results in genotyping procedure. For all HPV
positive tissues P16 immunostaining was applied in order to confirm active viral 
infection.
RESULTS: In the group of 383 breast cancers, HPV positivity was found in 17
samples (4.4%) in nested PCR. All these samples were subjected to HPV genotyping.
This analysis revealed presence of HPV type 16 into two tumors (0.5%). In these
two cancers, P16 overexpression was reported.
CONCLUSION: In breast tumors of patients from south-central Poland in Poland, HPV
positivity is demonstrated in very low percentage of cases.
