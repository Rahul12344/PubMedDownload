Coronaviruses have brought severe challenges to public health all over the world 
in the past 20years. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic
that has led to millions of deaths, belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus. Alpha-
and beta-coronaviruses encode a unique protein, nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1)
that both suppresses host immune responses and reduces global gene expression
levels in the host cells. As a key pathogenicity factor of coronaviruses, Nsp1
redirects the host translation machinery to increase synthesis of viral proteins.
Through multiple mechanisms, coronaviruses impede host protein expression through
Nsp1, while escaping inhibition to allow the translation of viral RNA. In this
review, we discuss current data about suppression of the immune responses and
inhibition of protein synthesis induced by coronavirus Nsp1, as well as the
prospect of live-attenuated vaccine development with virulence-attenuated viruses
with mutations in Nsp1.
