Monitoring the invasion process of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus and 
its interaction with the contender Aedes aegypti, is critical to prevent and
control the arthropod-borne viruses (i.e., Arboviruses) they transmit to humans. 
Generally, the superior ecological competitor Ae. albopictus displaces Ae.
aegypti from most geographic areas, with the combining factors of biology and
environment influencing the competitive outcome. Nonetheless, detailed studies
asserting displacement come largely from sub-tropical areas, with relatively less
effort being made in tropical environments, including no comprehensive research
about Aedes biological interactions in Mesoamerica. Here, we examine contemporary
and historical mosquito surveillance data to assess the role of shifting abiotic 
conditions in shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of competing Aedes species 
in the Republic of Panama. In accordance with prior studies, we show that Ae.
albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti under suboptimal wet tropical climate
conditions and more vegetated environments within the southwestern Azuero
Peninsula. Conversely, in the eastern Azuero Peninsula, Ae. aegypti persists with
Ae. albopictus under optimal niche conditions in a dry and more seasonal tropical
climate. While species displacement was stable over the course of two years, the 
presence of both species generally appears to fluctuate in tandem in areas of
coexistence. Aedes albopictus was always more frequently found and abundant
regardless of location and climatic season. The heterogenous environmental
conditions of Panama shape the competitive outcome and micro-geographic
distribution of Aedes mosquitoes, with potential consequences for the
transmission dynamics of urban and sylvatic zoonotic diseases.Supplementary
