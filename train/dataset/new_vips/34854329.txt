INTRODUCTION: In solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, viral infections are
associated with direct morbidity and mortality and may influence long-term
allograft outcomes. Prevention of viral infections by vaccination, antiviral
prophylaxis, and behavioral measures is therefore of paramount importance.
AREAS COVERED: We searched Pubmed to select publications to review current
preventive strategies against the most important viral infections in SOT
recipients, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, CMV and other herpesvirus, viral
hepatitis, measles, mumps, rubella, and BK virus.
EXPERT OPINION: The clinical significance of the reduced humoral response
following mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in SOT recipients still needs to be better
clarified, in particular with regard to the vaccines' efficacy in preventing
severe disease. Although a third dose improve immunogenicity and is already
integrated into routine practice in several countries, further research is still 
needed to explore additional interventions. In the upcoming years, further data
are expected to better delineate the role of virus-specific cell mediated immune 
monitoring for the prevention of CMV and potentially other viral diseases, and
the role of the letermovir in the prevention of CMV in SOT recipients. Future
studies including clinical endpoints will hopefully facilitate the integration of
successful new influenza vaccination strategies into clinical practice.
