OBJECTIVE: To explore the patterns of sickness absence in National Health Service
(NHS) staff attributable to mental ill health during the first wave of the
COVID-19 epidemic in March-July 2020.
DESIGN: Case-referent analysis of a secondary dataset.
SETTING: NHS Trusts in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Pseudonymised data on 959 356 employees who were continuously
employed by NHS trusts during 1 January 2019 to 31 July 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in the burden of sickness absence due to mental ill
health from 2019 to 2020 according to demographic, regional and occupational
characteristics.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 164 202 new sickness absence episodes for mental 
ill health were recorded in 12.5% (119 525) of the study sample. There was a
spike of sickness absence for mental ill health in March-April 2020 (899 730 days
lost) compared with 519 807 days in March-April 2019; the surge was driven by an 
increase in new episodes of long-term absence and had diminished by May/June
2020. The increase was greatest in those aged >60 years (227%) and among
employees of Asian and Black ethnic origin (109%-136%). Among doctors and
dentists, the number of days absent declined by 12.7%. The biggest increase was
in London (122%) and the smallest in the East Midlands (43.7%); the variation
between regions reflected the rates of COVID-19 sickness absence during the same 
period.
CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 epidemic led to an increase in sickness absence
attributed to mental ill health in NHS staff, this had substantially declined by 
May/June 2020, corresponding with the decrease in pressures at work as the first 
wave of the epidemic subsided.
