The development of vaccines against coronaviruses has focused on the spike (S)
protein, which is required for the recognition of host-cell receptors and thus
elicits neutralizing antibodies. Targeting conserved epitopes on the S protein
offers the potential for pan-beta-coronavirus vaccines that could prevent future 
pandemics. We displayed five B-cell epitopes, originally identified in the
convalescent sera from recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
patients, on the surface of the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and evaluated these
formulations as vaccines. Prime-boost immunization of mice with three of these
candidate vaccines, CPMV-988, CPMV-1173, and CPMV-1209, elicited high antibody
titers that neutralized the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) in vitro and showed an early Th1-biased profile (2-4 weeks)
transitioning to a slightly Th2-biased profile just after the second boost (6
weeks). A pentavalent slow-release implant comprising all five peptides displayed
on the CPMV elicited anti-S protein and epitope-specific antibody titers, albeit 
at a lower magnitude compared to the soluble formulations. While the CPMV
remained intact when released from the PLGA implants, processing results in loss 
of RNA, which acts as an adjuvant. Loss of RNA may be a reason for the lower
efficacy of the implants. Finally, although the three epitopes (988, 1173, and
1209) that were found to be neutralizing the SARS-CoV were 100% identical to the 
SARS-CoV-2, none of the vaccine candidates neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro
suggesting differences in the natural epitope perhaps caused by conformational
changes or the presence of N-linked glycans. While a cross-protective vaccine
candidate was not developed, a multivalent SARS vaccine was developed. The
technology discussed here is a versatile vaccination platform that can be pivoted
toward other diseases and applications that are not limited to infectious
diseases.
