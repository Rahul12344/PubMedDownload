Hypothalamic oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) neurons have been at
the center of several physiological and behavioral studies. Advances in viral
vector biology and the development of transgenic rodent models have allowed for
targeted gene expression to study the functions of specific cell populations and 
brain circuits. In this study, we compared the efficiency of various
adeno-associated viral vectors in these cell populations and demonstrated that
none of the widely used promoters were, on their own, effective at driving
expression of a down-stream fluorescent protein in OXT or AVP neurons. As
anticipated, the OXT promoter could efficiently drive gene expression in OXT
neurons and this efficiency is solely attributed to the promoter and not the
viral serotype. We also report that a dual virus approach using an OXT promoter
driven Cre recombinase significantly improved the efficiency of viral
transduction in OXT neurons. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the OXT
promoter for conducting functional studies on OXT neurons by using an OXT
specific viral system to record neural activity of OXT neurons in lactating
female rats across time. We conclude that extreme caution is needed when
employing non-neuron-specific viral approaches/promoters to study neural
populations within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
