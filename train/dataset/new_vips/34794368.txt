A juvenile, male tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) developed illness after capture 
in Florida waters and was euthanized. Gross lesions included mild skin abrasions,
hepatic atrophy, and coelomic fluid. Histologically, gills contained multifocal
lamellar epithelial cell necrosis and thromboses. Scattered gill and esophageal
epithelial cells had large, basophilic, intracytoplasmic, and intranuclear
inclusions. Ultrastructurally, lamellar epithelial cells contained arrays of
intracytoplasmic viral particles and scattered intranuclear nucleocapsids.
Capsulated virions were 148 ± 11 nm with an 84 ± 8 nm icosahedral nucleocapsid
and an electron-dense core. Next-generation sequencing, quantitative polymerase
chain reaction, and in situ hybridization performed on formalin-fixed tissue
confirmed a herpes-like viral infection. The viral polymerase shared 24% to 31%
protein homology with other alloherpesviruses of fish, indicating a divergent
virus. This report documents the pathologic findings associated with a
molecularly confirmed novel herpes-like virus in an elasmobranch.
