BACKGROUND: In Australia, Chinese migrants are among the populations most
affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but often experience late diagnosis
or access to clinical care. This study aims to explore approaches to increase HBV
testing in Australia's Chinese community and inform evaluation planning,
specifically to i) assess the feasibility and acceptability of HBV educational
programs, and ii) compare HBV testing uptake in people receiving a tailored
education resource focussing on liver cancer prevention compared with a standard 
HBV education package.
METHODS: This is a pre-post mixed-methods pilot and feasibility study. People of 
Chinese ethnicity and unsure of their HBV infection or immunity status were
recruited from ten community sites in Melbourne, Australia in 2019-2020.
Participants were randomised to receive an education package (comprised of a
leaflet and in-person one-on-one educational session) with a focus on either 1)
standard HBV-related information, or 2) liver cancer prevention. Participants
completed a baseline questionnaire prior to receiving the intervention and were
followed up at 6 months' time for a questionnaire and an opt-in semi-structured
interview. Primary study outcomes included feasibility of study procedures,
measured by recruitment, participation, and retention rates; acceptability of the
education program assessed by acceptability scores; and HBV testing uptake rate
in each arm. Secondary outcomes include HBV-related knowledge change, assessed by
pre-post comparison; and factors affecting participants' testing behaviour
analysed using qualitative data.
RESULTS: Fifty-four participants received an education package; baseline and
follow-up data from 33 (61%) were available. The study procedures of recruitment 
and retention were feasible; the acceptability of the education program was
moderate with improved HBV-related knowledge observed. Four participants
self-reported being tested: one (1/15, 7%) in the standard HBV information group 
and three (3/18, 17%) in the liver cancer prevention information group. Factors
identified as affecting testing included perceived relevance and seriousness of
HBV, healthcare access and costs of testing, and perceptions of the role of
primary care providers in HBV-related care.
CONCLUSION: A tailored education program targeting ethnic Chinese in Australia
was feasible with moderate acceptability. A larger study is required to determine
if a liver cancer prevention message would improve HBV testing uptake in Chinese 
community than standard HBV education message. Supports from healthcare
providers, community-based testing programs, and public health education programs
are likely needed to motivate diagnostic testing among Chinese people at risk of 
HBV infection.
