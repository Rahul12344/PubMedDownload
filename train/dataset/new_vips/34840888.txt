Purpose of Review: To describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, 
and outcomes of 4 confirmed Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases and a review 
of the literature.
Recent Findings: There was a sharp rise in the number of EEE cases in the United 
States in 2019, with 38 confirmed cases and 15 deaths. Our institution cared for 
10% of patients with neuroinvasive EEE nationwide. These were the first cases
seen locally since 2010.
Summary: EEE virus causes one of the most lethal types of arboviral encephalitis 
in the United States with a mortality of 30%-40%. Manifestations of EEE
infections can range from mild encephalopathy to coma. Common findings include
CSF pleocytosis and involvement of the basal ganglia on MRI. Given the rarity of 
this disease and nonspecific findings, diagnosis can be challenging, and a high
clinical suspicion is important. Management is mainly supportive, and the use of 
IV immunoglobulin remains controversial. Two of our 4 patients died; these
patients had coma within 48 hours, hyponatremia, involvement of bilateral thalami
and brainstem, status epilepticus, and severe brain dysfunction in EEG.
