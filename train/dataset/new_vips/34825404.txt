The gastrointestinal tract houses millions of microbes collectively referred to
as the gut microbiome. The gut microbes comprise of bacteria, viruses, fungi,
archaea, and microscopic eukaryotes, which co-evolved or colonize the gut forming
complex symbiotic and mutualistic relationships. A state of homeostasis is
required between host and gut microbiome relationship to maintain several host
beneficial processes. Alterations in the taxonomic and functional composition of 
the gut microbes are associated with several human diseases including
gastrointestinal cancers. Owed to their overwhelming abundance and ease of
characterization, several studies focus on the role of bacteria in
gastrointestinal cancers. There is however growing evidence that non-bacteria gut
microbes are associated with the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancers. This
review details the association of non-bacteria gut microbes including fungi,
viruses, and archaea and their potential manipulation in the prevention and
treatment of human gastrointestinal cancers.
