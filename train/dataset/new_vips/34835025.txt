Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease, which
still causes large economic losses for the swine industry. Therefore, it is
urgent to find a new strategy to prevent and control PRV infection. Previous
studies have proven that guanine (G)-rich DNA or RNA sequences in some other
viruses' genomes have the potential to form G-quadruplex (G4), which serve as
promising antivirus targets. In this study, we identified two novel G4-forming
sequences, OriL-A and OriL-S, which are located at the upstream origin of
replication (OriL) in the PRV genome and conserved across 32 PRV strains.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and a gel electrophoresis assay showed that 
the two G-rich sequences can fold into parallel G4 structures in vitro. Moreover,
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting and a Taq polymerase stop
assay indicated that the G4 ligand PhenDC3 has the capacity to bind and stabilize
the G4. Notably, the treatment of PRV-infected cells with G4-stabilizer PhenDC3
significantly inhibited PRV DNA replication in host cells but did not affect
PRV's attachment and entry. These results not only expand our knowledge about the
G4 characteristics in the PRV genome but also suggest that G4 may serve as an
innovative therapeutic target against PRV.
