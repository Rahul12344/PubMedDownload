Isothermal amplification-based tests have been introduced as rapid, low-cost, and
simple alternatives to real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection. The
clinical performance of two isothermal amplification-based tests (Atila
Biosystems iAMP coronavirus disease of 2019 [COVID-19] detection test and
OptiGene COVID-19 direct plus RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification [LAMP]
test) was compared with that of clinical RT-PCR assays using different sampling
strategies. A total of 1,378 participants were tested across 4 study sites.
Compared with standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall sensitivity and
specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2% and
94.9%, respectively, and increased to 88.8% and 89.5%, respectively, after
exclusion of an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic site
from which the sample was collected. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal sampling was 
65.4% (range across study sites, 52.8% to 79.8%), for midturbinate was 88.2%, for
saliva was 55.1% (range across study sites, 42.9% to 77.8%), and for anterior
nares was 66.7% (range across study sites, 63.6% to 76.5%). The specificity for
these anatomic collection sites ranged from 96.7% to 100%. Sensitivity improved
in symptomatic patients (overall, 82.7%) and those with a higher viral load
(overall, 92.4% for cycle threshold [CT] of ≤25). Sensitivity and specificity of 
the OptiGene direct plus RT-LAMP test, which was conducted at a single study
site, were 25.5% and 100%, respectively. The Atila iAMP COVID test with
midturbinate sampling is a rapid, low-cost assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2,
especially in symptomatic patients and those with a high viral load, and could be
used to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in clinical settings.
Variation of performance between study sites highlights the need for
site-specific clinical validation of these assays before clinical adoption.
IMPORTANCE Numerous SARS-CoV-2 detection assays have been developed and
introduced into the market under emergency use authorizations (EUAs). EUAs are
granted primarily based on small studies of analytic sensitivity and specificity 
with limited clinical validations. A thorough clinical performance evaluation of 
SARS-CoV-2 assays is important to understand the strengths, limitations, and
specific applications of these assays. In this first large-scale multicentric
study, we evaluated the clinical performance and operational characteristics of
two isothermal amplification-based SARS-CoV-2 tests, namely, (i) iAMP COVID-19
detection test (Atila BioSystems, USA) and (ii) COVID-19 direct plus RT-LAMP test
(OptiGene Ltd., UK), compared with those of clinical RT-PCR tests using different
sampling strategies (i.e., nasopharyngeal, self-sampled anterior nares,
self-sampled midturbinate, and saliva). An important specific use for these
isothermal amplification-based, rapid, low-cost, and easy-to-perform SARS-CoV-2
assays is to allow for a safer return to preventive clinical encounters, such as 
cancer screening, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that have low 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates.
