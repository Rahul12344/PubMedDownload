Human is the host of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) especially in childhood and
adolescence. Most of them are asymptomatic infection and self-limiting. However, 
for those patients who suffer from immune dysfunction, EBV infection will be
life-threatening. Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis
(EBV-HLH) is one of the severe effects. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis 
of EBV-HLH and other EBV infectious diseases are mentioned in this paper. The
molecular biology mechanism and complications of EBV-HLH are equally briefly
presented. It also provides a practical method for the genetic diagnosis of such 
diseases and the differential diagnosis with other human immunodeficiency
diseases for medical scientists in routine clinical practice.
