The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, characterized by home confinement and other restrictive 
measures to reduce the spread of the infection, led to significant changes in
people's habits and lifestyle. One of the most common problems is the worsening
of sleep quality or quantity, which could have negative effects on psychological 
wellbeing, particularly in older adults. The purposes of the present literature
review considering healthy aging subjects are (a) to examine the existing
research on sleep alterations during the current pandemic and (b) to highlight
possible relationships between sleep problems and psychological distress. A
systematic search strategy was implemented according to PRISMA guidelines in the 
international literature online databases, up to 1 July 2021. After
identification and screening phases, 11 articles were included in this review.
The studies found possible associations between sleep problems and mood
changes-particularly in terms of depression and anxiety. In addition, altered
sleep patterns seemed to be related to changes in individual aspects, lifestyle, 
and attitudes adopted by older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, the
pandemic could affect the sleep and psychological wellbeing of the older
population, even in healthy aging.
