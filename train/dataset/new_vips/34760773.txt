Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a health emergency for the 
world in which started in 2019. Various factors are involved in the pathogenesis 
of this virus, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the type of diet,
the degree of observance of health protocols, and the health status of people.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status and health
behaviors of patients infected with COVID-19.
Methods: A descriptive-analytical research method was used in this study. One of 
the outpatient centers for the patients infected with COVID-19 in Kermanshah was 
selected as the research setting. The study population included all patients
infected with COVID-19 and the sample size was 200 people. Data were analyzed by 
SPSS version 22.
Results: Most patients (51%) were females and most of them suffered from body
aches (81%) and headaches (94%). Most of the patients (76%) did not use a mask.
Regarding the nutritional status, a large number of patients used all food groups
such as carbohydrates, proteins, fruits, and vegetables less than the standard
amount.

prone to the disease than others and adherence to social distancing and mask use 
helps a lot to control the disease. In addition, the appropriate intake of food
groups reduces the severity of the disease by strengthening the immune system in
