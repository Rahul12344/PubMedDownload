OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of primary 
care physicians in Texas around vaccine acceptance and potential patient barriers
to vaccination. National surveys have shown fluctuating levels of acceptance for 
COVID-19 vaccination, and primary care physicians could play a crucial role in
increasing vaccine uptake.
DESIGN: This study employed a cross-sectional anonymous survey design to collect 
data using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked about vaccination
practices and policies at their practice site, perceptions of patient and
community acceptance and confidence in responding to patient vaccine concerns.
SETTING: From November 2020 to January 2021, family medicine physicians and
paediatricians completed an online questionnaire on COVID-19 vaccination that was
distributed by professional associations.
PARTICIPANTS: The survey was completed by 573 practising physicians, the majority
of whom identified as family medicine physicians (71.0%) or paediatricians
(25.7%), who are currently active in professional associations in Texas.
RESULTS: About three-fourths (74.0%) of participants reported that they would get
the vaccine as soon as it became available. They estimated that slightly more
than half (59.2%) of their patients would accept the vaccine, and 67.0% expected 
that the COVID-19 vaccine would be accepted in their local community. The
majority of participants (87.8%) reported always, almost always or usually
endorsing vaccines, including high levels of intention to recommend COVID-19
vaccination (81.5%). Participants felt most confident responding to patient
concerns related to education about vaccine types, safety and necessity and
reported least confidence in responding to personal or religious objections to
COVID-19 vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the physicians surveyed stated that they would
receive the COVID-19 vaccination when it was available to them and were confident
in their ability to respond to patient concerns. With additional education,
support and shifting COVID-19 vaccinations into primary care settings, primary
care physicians can use the trust they have built with their patients to address 
vaccine hesitancy and potentially increase acceptance and uptake.
