Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an uncommon and aggressive type of mature B cell 
lymphoma rarely involving gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we describe a case
of PBL involving the colon in HIV/Epstein-Barr virus negative immunocompetent
patient who presented with anaemia and weight loss but no significant GI
symptoms. It emphasises that even in the absence of classical risk factors, one
should consider possibility of this condition as this is potentially curable.
Also, we would like to highlight the diagnostic and treatment challenges of such 
an aggressive lymphoma in a frail elderly patient with multiple comorbidities.
