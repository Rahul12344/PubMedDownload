Respiratory viruses represent a major public health concern, as they are highly
mutated, resulting in new strains emerging with high pathogenicity. Currently,
the world is suffering from the newly evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), a mild-to-severe respiratory tract infection with frequent ability to
give rise to fatal pneumonia in humans. The overwhelming outbreak of SARS-CoV-2
continues to unfold all over the world, urging scientists to put an end to this
global pandemic through biological and pharmaceutical interventions. Currently,
there is no specific treatment option that is capable of COVID-19 pandemic
eradication, so several repurposed drugs and newly conditionally approved
vaccines are in use and heavily applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The
emergence of new variants of the virus that partially or totally escape from the 
immune response elicited by the approved vaccines requires continuous monitoring 
of the emerging variants to update the content of the developed vaccines or
modify them totally to match the new variants. Herein, we discuss the potential
therapeutic and prophylactic interventions including repurposed drugs and the
newly developed/approved vaccines, highlighting the impact of virus evolution on 
the immune evasion of the virus from currently licensed vaccines for COVID-19.
