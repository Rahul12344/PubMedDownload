Rabies is a deadly viral disease caused by the rabies virus (RABV), transmitted
through a bite of an infected host, resulting in irreversible neurological
symptoms and a 100% fatality rate in humans. Despite many aspects describing
rabies neuropathogenesis, numerous hypotheses remain unanswered and concealed.
Observations obtained from infected primary neurons or mouse brain samples are
more relevant to human clinical rabies than permissive cell lines; however,
limitations regarding the ethical issue and sample accessibility become a hurdle 
for discovering new insights into virus-host interplays. To better understand
RABV pathogenesis in humans, we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC)-derived neurons to offer the opportunity for an inimitable study of RABV 
infection at a molecular level in a pathologically relevant cell type. This study
describes the characteristics and detailed proteomic changes of hiPSC-derived
neurons in response to RABV infection using LC-MS/MS quantitative analysis. Gene 
ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) reveals
temporal changes of proteins related to metabolic process, immune response,
neurotransmitter transport/synaptic vesicle cycle, cytoskeleton organization, and
cell stress response, demonstrating fundamental underlying mechanisms of
neuropathogenesis in a time-course dependence. Lastly, we highlighted plausible
functions of heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70 or HSPA8) that might play a
pivotal role in regulating RABV replication and pathogenesis. Our findings
acquired from this hiPSC-derived neuron platform help to define novel cellular
mechanisms during RABV infection, which could be applicable to further studies to
widen views of RABV-host interaction.
