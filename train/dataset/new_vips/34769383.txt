Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains spike
proteins that assist the virus in entering host cells. In the absence of a
specific intervention, efforts are afoot throughout the world to find an
effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Through innovative techniques, monoclonal
antibodies (MAbs) are being designed and developed to block a particular pathway 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. More than 100 patent applications describing the
development of MAbs and their application against SARS-CoV-2 have been
registered. Most of them target the receptor binding protein so that the
interaction between virus and host cell can be prevented. A few monoclonal
antibodies are also being patented for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Some of them,
like RegeneronÂ® have already received emergency use authorization. These protein 
molecules are currently preferred for high-risk patients such as those over 65
years old with compromised immunity and those with metabolic disorders such as
obesity. Being highly specific in action, monoclonal antibodies offer one of the 
most appropriate interventions for both the prevention and treatment of
SARS-CoV-2. Technological advancement has helped in producing highly efficacious 
MAbs. However, these agents are known to induce immunogenic and non-immunogenic
reactions. More research and testing are required to establish the suitability of
administering MAbs to all patients at risk of developing a severe illness. This
patent study is focused on MAbs as a therapeutic option for treating COVID-19, as
well as their invention, patenting information, and key characteristics.
