AIMS OF THE STUDY: There is increasing interest in better understanding of long
COVID, a condition characterised by long-term sequelae — appearing or persisting 
after the typical convalescence period — of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Herein, we describe long-term outcomes regarding residual symptoms and
psychological distress in hospitalised patients 1 year after COVID-19. METHODS:
This prospective cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalised
for confirmed COVID-19 in two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals between March and
June 2020. The primary endpoint was evidence of long COVID 1 year after
discharge, defined as ≥1 persisting or new symptom related to COVID-19, from a
predefined list of symptoms. Secondary endpoints included psychological distress 
and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: Among 90 patients
included in the study, 63 (70%) had symptoms of long COVID 1 year after
hospitalisation, particularly fatigue (46%), concentration difficulties (31%),
shortness of breath (21%) and post-exertion malaise (20%). Three predictors,
namely duration of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.00–1.22; p = 0.041), severity of illness (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04–1.37; p =
0.013), and self-perceived overall health status 30 days after hospitalisation
(OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–1.00; p = 0.027) were associated with long COVID. Regarding
secondary endpoints, 16 (18%) experienced psychological distress and 3 (3.3%)
patients had symptoms of PTSD. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients
report symptoms of long COVID 1 year after hospitalisation, which negatively
affects their quality of life. The most important risk factors were severe
initial presentation of COVID-19 with long hospital stays.
