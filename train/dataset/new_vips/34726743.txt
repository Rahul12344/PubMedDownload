Importance: Continuous assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the US Food 
and Drug Administration-authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is critical to amplify
transparency, build public trust, and ultimately improve overall health outcomes.
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness research study 
used large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records from the
multistate Mayo Clinic Health System (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, and
Iowa) to identify vaccinated and unvaccinated adults between February 27 and July
22, 2021. The unvaccinated cohort was matched on a propensity score derived from 
age, sex, zip code, race, ethnicity, and previous number of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase
chain reaction tests. The final study cohort consisted of 8889 patients in the
vaccinated group and 88 898 unvaccinated matched patients.
Exposure: Single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts, measured by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase
chain reaction testing.
Results: The study was composed of 8889 vaccinated patients (4491 men [50.5%];
mean [SD] age, 52.4 [16.9] years) and 88 898 unvaccinated patients (44 748 men
[50.3%]; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [16.7] years). The incidence rate ratio of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts was 0.26
(95% CI, 0.20-0.34) (60 of 8889 vaccinated patients vs 2236 of 88 898
unvaccinated individuals), which corresponds to an effectiveness of 73.6% (95%
CI, 65.9%-79.9%) and a 3.73-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings are consistent with the clinical
trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S and the first retrospective analysis,
suggesting that the vaccine is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, even
with the spread of variants such as Alpha or Delta that were not present in the
original studies, and reaffirm the urgent need to continue mass vaccination
efforts globally.
