Although women are about half of world's population, they are underrepresented in
many sectors including academia and the research scenario in general. Gender gap 
in Entomology has been pointed out in other publications; however, data for
Brazil has never been demonstrated. Here we provide a diagnosis for the Brazilian
Entomology scenario in order to contribute to propositions towards disentangling 
the gender gap in general. We analyzed scientometric data for Brazilian
Entomology focusing on gender disparity and on personal perceptions related to
the gender gap through an online questionnaire. We detected a pervasive gender
bias in which the scissor-shaped curve is the most representative effect of it:
women were the majority in lower degree stages but the minority in higher degree 
stages (permanent positions and positions of prestige and power). We also
observed mentorship bias and discussed these results in light of
intersectionality and the COVID-19 pandemic. Gender differences were perceived
differently by the questionnaire respondents considering age, gender, and
parenting. With this data and analyses, we have provided elements to stimulate
and support change to a healthier and more equitable academic space.
