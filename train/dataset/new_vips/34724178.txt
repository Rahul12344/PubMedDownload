The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the lack of
approved drugs against acute viral diseases. Plants are considered inexhaustible 
sources of drugs for several diseases and clinical conditions, but plant-derived 
compounds have seen little success in the field of antivirals. Here, we present
the case for the use of compounds from vascular plants, including alkaloids,
flavonoids, polyphenols, and tannins, as antivirals, particularly for the
treatment of COVID-19. We review current evidence for the use of these
phytochemicals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and present their potential targets
in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.
