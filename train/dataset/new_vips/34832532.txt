Vector behavioural traits, such as fitness, host-seeking, and host-feeding, are
key determinants of vectorial capacity, pathogen transmission, and epidemiology
of the vector-borne disease. Several studies have shown that infection with
pathogens can alter these behavioural traits of the arthropod vector. Here, we
review relevant publications to assess how pathogens modulate the behaviour of
mosquitoes and ticks, major vectors for human diseases. The research has shown
that infection with pathogens alter the mosquito's flight activity, mating,
fecundity, host-seeking, blood-feeding, and adaptations to insecticide bed nets, 
and similarly modify the tick's locomotion, questing heights, vertical and
horizontal walks, tendency to overcome obstacles, and host-seeking ability.
Although some of these behavioural changes may theoretically increase
transmission potential of the pathogens, their effect on the disease epidemiology
remains to be verified. This study will not only help in understanding
virus-vector interactions but will also benefit in establishing role of these
behavioural changes in improved epidemiological models and in devising new vector
management strategies.
