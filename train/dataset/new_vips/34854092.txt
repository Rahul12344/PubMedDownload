BACKGROUND: In Canada, the deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM) has been 
progressively reduced from a permanent deferral for MSM since 1977, to 5 years,
1 year, and, most recently, 3 months. We estimated human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) residual risk and compliance with the MSM time deferral after each change.
METHODS: Four anonymous online compliance surveys were carried out before and
after each change. HIV incidence and prevalence were monitored from 2010 to 2021.
Residual risk was estimated using the incidence-window period model.
RESULTS: Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence, incidence, and residual risk
did not change with incrementally shorter MSM deferrals. The residual risk per
million donations post 3-month deferral was 0.05 (0.001-0.371). Men with
temporally remote MSM history became eligible and, therefore, compliant as the
deferral periods decreased (Cochran-Armitage p value = <.0001). However, the
percentage of men with MSM history in the last 3 months with the indefinite
deferral in place was similar to the percentage noncompliant, while the 3-month
deferral was in place. MSM donors did not report high-risk behaviors for which
they would otherwise be deferred in any survey. Following the change, an
estimated 4467 MSM per year were eligible to donate, an increase from 2501
estimated eligible MSM donors following the change to the 1-year deferral.
CONCLUSION: With progressively shorter MSM deferral periods, HIV residual risk
was unchanged. The proportion of male donors with deferrable MSM history remained
low, while those with temporally remote MSM history became eligible, increasing
the number of eligible MSM donors.
