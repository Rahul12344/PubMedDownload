BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The current study was done to examine the efficacy of
naproxen in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was
done on hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Patients
were randomly assigned to receive either naproxen (two capsules per day each
containing 500 mg naproxen sodium) or placebo (containing starch) for five days
along with the routine treatment that was nationally recommended for COVID-19
infection. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection, the time to clinical
improvement, blood pressure, laboratory parameters, and death due to COVID-19
infection were considered as the outcome variables in the present study.
RESULTS: Treatment with naproxen improved cough and shortness of breath in
COVID-19 patients; such that, compared with placebo, naproxen intake was
associated with 2.90 (95% CI: 1.10-7.66) and 2.82 (95% CI: 1.05-7.55) times more 
improvement in cough and shortness of breath, respectively. In addition, naproxen
administration resulted in a significant increase in mean corpuscular volume
(MCV) and had a preventive effect on the reduction of systolic blood pressure in 
COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with naproxen can improve cough and shortness of breath in 
COVID-19-infected patients. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.
