Pediatric cardiology has matured profoundly over the last 50 years, paralleled by
a similar development in pediatric cardiac surgery and cardiac anesthesia. This
field of medicine provides structured and effective care for a very heterogeneous
group of diseases including congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies and heart 
failure, myocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, inherited and acquired
arrhythmias, Kawasaki disease and more recently multisystemic inflammatory
syndrome of children related to primary infection by SARS-CoV-2. This review
summarizes achievements and results in selected topics of pediatric cardiology
and cardiac surgery with focused attention to the diagnosis and management of
congenital heart diseases.
