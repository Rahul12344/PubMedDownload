Epilepsy, progressive myoclonic 3, with or without intracellular inclusions (MIM#
611726) is a rare autosomal recessive condition associated with pathogenic
variants in KCTD7, which encodes the BR-C,ttk and bab/pox virus and zinc finger
domain-containing KCTD7 protein. We report four individuals from three Indian
families presenting with an initial period of normal development, progressive
myoclonic seizures followed by neuroregression and an abnormal
electroencephalogram. We identified two novel missense variants, c.458G>C
p.(Arg153Pro) and c.205C>G p.(Leu69Val) and one known disease-causing variant,
c.280C>T p.(Arg94Trp) in KCTD7 by exome sequencing. We review the literature of
67 individuals with variants in KCTD7. Our study expands the molecular spectrum
of KCTD7-related progressive myoclonic epilepsy.
