Currently, the world is facing the emergence of a virus that causes pneumonia in 
humans, which has a higher probability of causing complications that include
respiratory distress syndrome and death. The new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV),
which is currently known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) . This virus was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of
China, and appears to have been a zoonotic infection that has now adapted to
humans. On March 11 2020, COVID-19 was announced as a pandemic by the World
Health Organisation (WHO), causing widespread panic worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is
genetically similar to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related (SARS) 
and shares many similarities with the disease features of influenza virus
infection. Scientists around the world are racing towards the development of
vaccines and antiviral for COVID-19. This review will provide an update of
COVID-19, a brief review of the symptoms and route of transmission, SARS-CoV-2
virus, and why it is highly infectious as well as the currently available
treatments and comorbidities.
