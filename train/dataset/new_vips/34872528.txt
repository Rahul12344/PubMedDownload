BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF)
is a serious liver disease with pathogenesis remaining unclear. This study aims
to investigate the association between testosterone levels, stage (early, middle,
or late, categorized according to clinical manifestation), severity scores, and
clinical outcomes of HBV-ACLF.
METHODS: This single-center observational study involved 160 male patients with
HBV-ACLF, 151 chronic hepatitis B patients without liver failure (CHB) and 106
healthy controls (HC). Morning blood samples were collected and androgen levels
analyzed by chemi-bioluminescent immunoassay. Time to death or liver
transplantation within 90 days comprised the primary composite outcome.
RESULTS: Serum levels of total testosterone (TT), free testosterone index (FTI), 
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol were significantly lower among
HBV-ACLF than CHB and HC, while androstenedione was higher. Low TT, sex hormone
binding globulin and FTI were associated with increased stage (of HBV-ACLF,
ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy) and severity scores (Model for End-stage
Liver Disease and Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B-ACLF scores). 
Low TT (< 142.39 ng/dL) was a risk factor for both the composite outcome and for 
death alone within 90 days. Multivariate analysis revealed TT to be an
independent predictor for the composite outcome (hazard ratio 2.57, 95% CI
1.09-6.02; P = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Low serum testosterone is common among male patients with HBV-ACLF
and predictive of increased severity and worse outcome of the disease and may
play an important role in the progression of HBV-ACLF.
