During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring and summer of
2020, paediatric heart centres were forced to rapidly alter the way patient care 
was provided to minimise interruption to patient care as well as exposure to the 
virus. In this survey-based descriptive study, we characterise changes that
occurred within paediatric cardiology practices across the United States and
described provider experience and attitudes towards these changes during the
pandemic. Common changes that were implemented included decreased numbers of
procedures, limiting visitors and shifting towards telemedicine encounters. The
information obtained from this survey may be useful in guiding and standardising 
responses to future public health crises.
