The coxsackievirus B3 strain PD-0 has been proposed as a new oncolytic virus for 
the treatment of colorectal carcinoma. Here, we generated a cDNA clone of PD-0
and analyzed the virus PD-H, newly generated from this cDNA, in xenografted and
syngenic models of colorectal cancer. Replication and cytotoxic assays revealed
that PD-H replicated and lysed colorectal carcinoma cell lines in vitro as well
as PD-0. Intratumoral injection of PD-H into subcutaneous DLD-1 tumors in nude
mice resulted in strong inhibition of tumor growth and significantly prolonged
the survival of the animals, but virus-induced systemic infection was observed in
one of the six animals. In a syngenic mouse model of subcutaneously growing
Colon-26 tumors, intratumoral administration of PD-H led to a significant
reduction of tumor growth, the prolongation of animal survival, the prevention of
tumor-induced cachexia, and the elevation of CD3+ and dendritic cells in the
tumor microenvironment. No virus-induced side effects were observed. After
intraperitoneal application, PD-H induced weak pancreatitis and myocarditis in
immunocompetent mice. By equipping the virus with target sites of miR-375, which 
is specifically expressed in the pancreas, organ infections were prevented.
Moreover, employment of this virus in a syngenic mouse model of CT-26 peritoneal 
carcinomatosis resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and an
increase in animal survival. The results demonstrate that the immune status of
the host, the route of virus application, and the engineering of the virus with
target sites of suitable microRNAs are crucial for the use of PD-H as an
oncolytic virus.
