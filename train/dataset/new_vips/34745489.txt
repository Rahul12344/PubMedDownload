Objective: This research aimed to explore the application of a mathematical model
based on deep learning in hospital infection control of novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) pneumonia.
Methods: First, the epidemic data of Beijing, China, were utilized to make a
definite susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model fitting to determine the
estimated value of the COVID-19 removal intensity β, which was then used to do a 
determined SIR model and a stochastic SIR model fitting for the hospital. In
addition, the reasonable β and γ estimates of the hospital were determined, and
the spread of the epidemic in hospital was simulated, to discuss the impact of
basal reproductive number changes, isolation, vaccination, and so forth on
COVID-19.
Results: There was a certain gap between the fitting of SIR to the remover and
the actual data. The fitting of the number of infections was accurate. The growth
rate of the number of infections decreased after measures, such as isolation,
were taken. The effect of herd immunity was achieved after the overall immunity
reached 70.9%.
Conclusion: The SIR model based on deep learning and the stochastic SIR fitting
model were accurate in judging the development trend of the epidemic, which can
provide basis and reference for hospital epidemic infection control.
