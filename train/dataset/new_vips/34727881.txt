BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
are increasingly recognized and include encephalopathy, although direct infection
of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial. We herein report the clinical
course and cytokine profiles of a patient with severe SARS-CoV-2-related
encephalopathy presenting aphasia.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old man developed acute consciousness disturbance
and status epileptics several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following
treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone, his consciousness and epileptic
seizures improved; however, amnestic aphasia and agraphia remained. Two months
after methylprednisolone pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin, his neurological
deficits improved. We found increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but not IL-2 and IL-10 in the serum
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the levels of serum IL-6 and MCP-1 were much
higher than those in the CSF. The level of IL-8 in the CSF after immunotherapy
was four times higher than that before immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The cytokine profile of our patient was similar to that seen in
severe SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy. We demonstrated (i) that the
characteristic aphasia can occur as a focal neurological deficit associated with 
SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy, and (ii) that IL8-mediated central nervous
system inflammation follows systemic inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-related
encephalopathy and can persist and worsen even after immunotherapy. Monitoring
IL-8 in CSF, and long-term corticosteroids may be required for treating
SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy.
