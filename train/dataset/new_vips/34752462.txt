Human mobility is crucial to understand the transmission pattern of COVID-19 on
spatially embedded geographic networks. This pattern seems unpredictable, and the
propagation appears unstoppable, resulting in over 350,000 death tolls in the
U.S. by the end of 2020. Here, we create the spatiotemporal inter-county mobility
network using 10 TB (Terabytes) trajectory data of 30 million smart devices in
the U.S. in the first six months of 2020. We investigate the bond percolation
process by removing the weakly connected edges. As we increase the threshold, the
mobility network nodes become less interconnected and thus experience
surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the
mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable set
of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the
second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United States,
played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and regions during
the pandemic. Beyond, our numerical results unveil that network characteristics
determine the critical thresholds and the bridge locations. The findings provide 
new insights into managing and controlling the connectivity of mobility networks 
during unprecedented disruptions. The work can also potentially offer practical
future infectious diseases both globally and locally.
