We identified small-molecule enhancers of cellular stress granules by observing
molecular crowding of proteins and RNAs in a time-dependent manner. Hit molecules
sensitized the IRF3-mediated antiviral mechanism in the presence of poly(I:C) and
inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inducing stress granule formation.
Thus, modulating multimolecular crowding can be a promising strategy against
SARS-CoV-2.
