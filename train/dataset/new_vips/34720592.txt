Purpose: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widely recognised to cause various tumours, 
and EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a special type of GC. It has
obviously different clinical features and pathological manifestations from
EBV-negative gastric carcinoma, but its progression remains elusive. The
underlying cancer progression of viral infection detected by genome-wide
transcriptome analysis has been demonstrated in numerous diseases.
Methods: We performed comparative RNA sequencing to identify gene expression
signatures between GC and EBVaGC cell lines. The differentially expressed (DE)
genes were analysed using gene ontology and pathway enrichment.
Results: A total of 4438 DE mRNAs, 3650 DE long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and
248 DE circular RNAs (circRNAs) were detected in GC cells after EBV infection,
most of which were highly related to oncogenesis. Likewise, EBV-coding RNA and
non-coding RNA were also well-supplemented in EBVaGC. According to
bioinformatics, DE mRNAs may contribute to the completion of EBV-infected host
cells and modulate mitosis. Binding to actin and participating in adherens
junctions to promote contact between the virus and cells are a potential function
of DE lncRNAs. The roles of DE circRNAs were enriched in DNA repair and protein
modification, and a typical example of this is acting as an miRNA sponge. The
establishment of a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network helps to determine the key elements
in the progression of EBVaGC.
Conclusion: This study is the first to systematically reveal the transcriptome
landscape of EBVaGC, which will provide an essential resource for genomic,
genetic, and molecular mechanisms in the future.
