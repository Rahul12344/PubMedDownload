Proper implementation of biosecurity is currently the only control measure of
African swine fever (ASF) in the absence of an effective vaccine or drug against 
the disease. Despite the efforts that Uganda's local and central governments have
invested to reduce livestock diseases, ASF outbreaks still persist in the
country. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of community-led
initiatives in the control of ASF in Mukono District, central Uganda. In Mukono
district, a community-led pilot program was initiated where stakeholders in the
pig value chain organized themselves into an ASF control task force to enforce
on-farm and pig value chain activities intended to limit the spread of ASF.
Semi-structured interviews with pig famers (n = 211) were conducted in two areas 
with contrasting practices: one with active community-initiated and monitored ASF
control initiatives since 2016 (Kasawo and Namuganga) and the other without such 
initiative as the control (Mpunge and Ntenjeru). A significant decline (Wilcoxon 
ranked sign test: Z =  - 5.412, p = 0.000) in the annual frequency of ASF
outbreaks in both Kasawo and Namuganga sub-counties was observed after the
implementation of community-led initiatives. The level of practice of most ASF
control measures was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in sub-counties that
instituted community-led ASF control initiatives than in the control
sub-counties. The results of this study demonstrate the power of community-led
initiatives in reducing ASF disease outbreaks in endemic areas.
