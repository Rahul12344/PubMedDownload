BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to associate with 
increased risk of thromboembolic events. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has long
been used to effectively manage those with large-vessel occlusive (LVO) stroke
and has similarly been implemented in the management of stroke in COVID-19
patients.
REVIEW SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic took the health care sector by a storm.
Thus, less is known about MT outcomes in this population and evidence suggesting 
poor outcomes postthrombectomy for COVID-19 patients is accumulating. We provide 
a narrative on some of the published studies on the outcomes of MT in COVID-19
patients with LVO between March 2020 and February 2021. A description of patient 
characteristics, risk factors, COVID-19 infection severity, stroke features and
thrombectomy success in this population is also presented as data from several
studies show that LVO in COVID-19 patients may have some distinguishing
characteristics that make management more challenging.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of COVID-19 on the long-term prognosis of stroke patients
after thrombectomy is yet to be determined. The accumulating evidence from
current studies indicates a negative impact of COVID-19 on outcomes in acute
ischemic stroke patients who receive MT, irrespective of timely, successful
angiographic recanalization. This review may help alert clinicians of some of the
COVID-19-specific postthrombectomy challenges.
