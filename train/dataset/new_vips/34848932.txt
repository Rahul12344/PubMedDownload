Cotton is one of the most important cellulose fibers, but the absence of
antimicrobial capacity along with the self-cleaning, UV protection and electric
conductivity often frustrates its wider applications in many fields.
Nanotechnology has provided new insights into the development of functional
nanomaterials with unique chemical and physical properties. Silver has been
effectively incorporated into the cotton fabrics as the antimicrobial agents due 
to the strong inhibitory and antimicrobial effects on a broad spectrum of
bacteria, fungi and virus with low toxicity to human being. In this review, a
variety of strategies have been summarized to load silver on cotton fabrics in
situ or ex situ and to fabricate high performance value-added cotton fabrics with
self-cleaning, UV protection, electric conductivity and antimicrobial capability 
depending on the synthesis of silver coating or silver-based nanocomposite
coating.
