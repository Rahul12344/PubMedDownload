INTRODUCTION: The clinical implications of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in
patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the clinical correlations of pre- and
post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA concentrations with treatment outcomes and
prognosis in patients with PTCL.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 128 patients diagnosed with PTCL with
available data on pre-treatment plasma EBV-DNA, including 63 patients for whom
post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA data were also available. Patients with extra-nodal
NK/T-<X00_Del_TrennDivis></X00_Del_TrennDivis>cell lymphoma were excluded from
this study.
RESULTS: Pre-treatment plasma EBV-DNA was elevated (e.g., ≥500 copies/mL) in
35.2% of PTCL patients, with significant differences in positive rates between
different subtypes of PTCL (p < 0.001). High pre-treatment EBV-DNA concentrations
were associated with advanced age (>60 years), elevated lactate dehydrogenase
levels, high International Prognostic Index (IPI), and positive EBV-encoded
RNAs-ISH in tumor specimens. In multivariate analyses, pre-treatment EBV-DNA ≥500
copies/mL was an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for IPI and
pathological subtypes (hazard ratio = 2.14, p = 0.032). For patients with
elevated pre-treatment EBV-DNA, normalization of EBV-DNA concentrations after
first-line chemotherapy was significantly associated with better overall response
rate (81.3% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.014), progression-free survival (12.0 months vs. 3.7
months, p = 0.011), and overall survival (37.9 months vs. 7.8 months, p = 0.012).
For patients achieving remission to first-line therapy, rebound of EBV-DNA levels
during follow-up was associated with disease relapse or progression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pre-treatment plasma EBV-DNA
concentration is a strong prognostic factor for PTCL. For patients with elevated 
pre-treatment EBV-DNA, dynamic monitoring of EBV-DNA changes after initiation of 
therapy is useful for predicting treatment outcome and disease relapse.
