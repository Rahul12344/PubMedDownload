Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have been emerging and some have
been linked to an increase in case numbers globally. However, there is yet a lack
of understanding of the molecular basis for the interactions between the human
ACE2 (hACE2) receptor and these VOCs. Here we examined several VOCs including
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, and demonstrate that five variants receptor-binding
domain (RBD) increased binding affinity for hACE2, and four variants
pseudoviruses increased entry into susceptible cells. Crystal structures of
hACE2-RBD complexes help identify the key residues facilitating changes in hACE2 
binding affinity. Additionally, soluble hACE2 protein efficiently prevent most of
the variants pseudoviruses. Our findings provide important molecular information 
and may help the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic agents
targeting these emerging mutants.
