In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the global effort to develop high
efficacy countermeasures to control the infection are being conducted at full
swing. While the efficacy of vaccines and coronavirus drugs are being tested, the
microbiome approach represents an alternative pathophysiology-based approach to
prevent the severity of the infection. In the current study, we evaluated the
action of a novel probiotic Lactobacillus&nbsp;plantarum Probio-88 against
SARS-COV-2 replication and immune regulation using an in vitro and in silico
study. The results showed that extract from this strain (P88-CFS) significantly
inhibited the replication of SARS-COV-2 and the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, compared with infected cells, P88-CFS treated 
cells showed a significant reduction in inflammatory markers such as IFN-α,
IFN-β, and IL-6. Using an in silico molecular docking approach, it was postulated
that the antiviral activity of L. plantarum Probio-88 was derived from
plantaricin E (PlnE) and F (PlnF). The high binding affinity and formation of
hydrogen bonding indicated that the association of PlnE and PlnF on SARS-COV-2
helicase might serve as a blocker by preventing the binding of ss-RNA during the 
replication of the virus. In conclusion, our study substantiated that P88-CFS
could be used as an integrative therapeutic approach along with vaccine to
contain the spread of the highly infectious pathogen and possibly its variants.
