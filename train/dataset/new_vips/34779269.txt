BACKGROUND: Chest radiography (CR) patterns for the diagnosis of COVID-19 have
been established. However, they were not ideated comparing CR features with those
of other pulmonary diseases.
PURPOSE: To create the most accurate COVID-19 pneumonia pattern comparing CR
findings of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases and to test the model
against the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) criteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: CR of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases,
admitted to the emergency department, were evaluated. Assessed features were
interstitial opacities, ground glass opacities, and/or consolidations and the
predominant lung alteration. We also assessed uni-/bilaterality, location
(upper/middle/lower), and distribution (peripheral/perihilar), as well as pleural
effusion and perihilar vessels blurring. A binary logistic regression was adopted
to obtain the most accurate CR COVID-19 pattern, and sensitivity and specificity 
were computed. The newly defined pattern was compared to BSTI criteria.
RESULTS: CR of 274 patients were evaluated (146 COVID-19, 128 non-COVID-19). The 
most accurate COVID-19 pneumonia pattern consisted of four features: bilateral
alterations (Expß=2.8, P=0.002), peripheral distribution of the predominant
(Expß=2.3, P=0.013), no pleural effusion (Expß=0.4, P=0.009), and perihilar
vessels' contour not blurred (Expß=0.3, P=0.002). The pattern showed 49%
sensitivity, 81% specificity, and 64% accuracy, while BSTI criteria showed 51%,
77%, and 63%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Bilaterality, peripheral distribution of the predominant lung
alteration, no pleural effusion, and perihilar vessels contour not blurred
determine the most accurate COVID-19 pneumonia pattern. Lower field involvement, 
proposed by BSTI criteria, was not a distinctive finding. The BSTI criteria has
lower specificity.
