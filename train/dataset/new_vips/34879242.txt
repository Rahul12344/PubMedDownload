An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype SAT2 occurred in
Egypt in 2018, which affected cattle and water buffalo. Previous phylogenetic
studies on FMDV circulating in Egypt have mainly focused on genomic regions
encoding structural proteins that determine the FMDV serotype. Still, none of
them have analyzed the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the Egyptian
SAT2/Lib-12 lineage. The present study aimed to analyze and identify the ORF
genome sequence of Lib-12 lineage that belongs to FMDV SAT2 topotype VII in
Egypt. The protocol workflow was optimized and tested using a representative
field isolate of FMDV/SAT2/Lib-12 from a bovine tongue sample collected in 2018
from Ismailia governorate (SAT2/EGY/Ismailia/2018). The protocol was based on
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with multiple overlapping
primers, amplicons sequencing, and assembly to complete the ORF consensus
sequence. Alignments of the sequence fragments formed consensus genome sequence
of 7219 nucleotides in length. The complete nucleotide sequence of the Egyptian
isolate was related to Ethiopian, Nigerian, and Ghanaian strains, with identity
not exceeding 95%. The divergence in the genetic identity of the Egyptian
SAT2/Lib-12 lineage from other Egyptian strains and the neighboring Libyan
isolates reached 7%, and this may be attributed to the absence of the Lib-12
lineage ORF sequence from Egypt and Libya in the database. The present study
significantly advances the knowledge of the molecular analysis of FMDV SAT2 and
the design of vaccine selection for FMDV SAT2 in Egypt. The study protocol could 
be applied to other FMDV serotypes.
