In this work, biocompatible, antimicrobial, and antiviral nanocomposites were
prepared through two steps. In the first step, periodate oxidation of cellulose
was performed to get dialdehyde cellulose (DAC). The second step included the
reaction of DAC with sulfur-containing amino acids included Cysteine (Cys) and
Methionine (Meth) in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). The prepared
nanocomposites were characterized via FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and TGA. Antimicrobial and
antiviral activities for all designed nanocomposites besides DAC were carried
out. Both DAC/GO/Cys and DAC/GO/Meth exhibited a promising antimicrobial activity
against Gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), Gram-positive (B. subtilis and
S. aureus), and unicellular fungi (C. Albicans and C. neoformans), while the
DAC/GO/Cys/Meth nanocomposite was the lowest. Moreover, all designed
nanocomposites have a strong antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus
1(HSV-1) at minimum nontoxic concentration. Additionally, Computational
procedures and Molecular docking showed the reactivity and stability of the
molecules that have biological activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and
HSV-1. As well as DAC incorporation with amino acid enhanced their reactivity and
their interaction.
