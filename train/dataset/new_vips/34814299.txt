According to the mechanism of drug inhibition of hepatitis B virus and the
analysis of clinical data, it is found that random factors in long-term treatment
produced uncertainty and resistance to hepatitis B virus infection rate, a model 
of hepatitis B virus with random interference infection rate is established. By
constructing Lyapunov function and using Ito's formula, it is proved that the
stochastic hepatitis B model has a unique global positive solution. The
sufficient conditions for the asymptotic behavior of solution are given. The
relationship between noise intensity and oscillation amplitude is obtained. The
effects of noise intensity on the asymptotic behavior of the model and antiviral 
therapy are simulated, and the conclusion of the theorem is verified. An
interesting phenomenon is also found that with the increase of noise intensity,
the number of drug-resistant viruses will decrease, which will affect the
accuracy of a single test of HBV DNA. Therefore, it is suggested to increase the 
frequency and interval of tests.
