OBJECTIVES: We used simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected nonhuman
primates to investigate longitudinal changes of brain volume caused by SIV and
the effect of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). In addition, the relation
between viral load, immune status, and brain volume were explored.
DESIGN: A longitudinal study of two healthy controls, five SIVmac239-infected
macaques received cART (SIV+cART+) at 40 days postinnoculation, and five
SIVmac239-infected macaques received no therapy (SIV+cART-).
METHODS: Structural T1-weighted MRI, blood and cerebrospinal fluid testing were
acquired at multiple time points for 48 weeks postinfection (wpi). Brain volume
was estimated using region of interest (ROI)-based analysis. Volume differences
were compared among three groups. Linear regression models tested the
associations between brain volumes and biomarkers (viral load, CD4+ T-cell count,
CD4+/CD8+ ratio).
RESULTS: In our model, brain volume alteration in SIV-infected macaques can be
detected at 12 wpi in several brain regions. As the infection progresses, the
SIV+cART- macaques displayed generalized gray matter atrophy at the endpoint.
Though initiate cART right after acute infection, SIV+cART+ macaques still
displayed brain atrophy but showed signs of reversibility. Plasma viral load is
mainly associated with subcortical nucleus volume whereas CD4+ T-cell count and
CD4+/CD8+ ratio in plasma were associated with widespread cortical volume.
CONCLUSION: The SIVmac239-infected Chinese origin macaque is a valid model for
neuroHIV. Brain atrophy caused by SIV infection can be relieved, even reversed,
by cART. Our model also provides new insights into understanding the pathogenesis
of brain injury in people with HIV (PWH).
