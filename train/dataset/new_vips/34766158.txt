The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a public health
crisis and global panic. This infectious disease is caused by a novel coronavirus
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Digital
polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), which is an emerging nucleic acid amplification
technology that allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids, plays an
important role in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we introduce the
principle and advantages of dPCR, and review the applications of dPCR in the
COVID-19 pandemic, including detection of low copy number viruses, measurement of
the viral load, preparation of reference materials, monitoring of virus
concentration in the environment, detection of viral mutations, and evaluation of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. We also discuss the challenges of dPCR in clinical
practice.
