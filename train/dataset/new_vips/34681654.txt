Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive among the neurological tumors. At
present, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen is associated with a positive
long-term outcome. In the majority of cases, the tumor recurs within 32-36 weeks 
of initial treatment. The recent discovery that Zika virus (ZIKV) has an
oncolytic action against GBM has brought hope for the development of new
therapeutic approaches. ZIKV is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family, and its 
infection during development has been associated with central nervous system
(CNS) malformations, including microcephaly, through the targeting of neural
stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). This finding has led various groups to
evaluate ZIKV's effects against glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), supposedly
responsible for GBM onset, progression, and therapy resistance. While preliminary
data support ZIKV tropism toward GSCs, a more accurate study of ZIKV mechanisms
of action is fundamental in order to launch ZIKV-based clinical trials for GBM
patients.
