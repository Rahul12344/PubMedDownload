BACKGROUND: Because of the very low incidence of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) coinfection in Korea, data on hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV coinfection are
limited. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and
treatment outcomes of patients with HCV/HIV coinfection in Korea.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all HCV-monoinfected and
HCV/HIV-coinfected patients treated with antivirals at National Medical Center in
Seoul, Korea, between January 2009 and March 2020.
RESULTS: We enrolled 220 HCV-monoinfected and 23 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients
treated with antivirals. The HCV/HIV-coinfected patients were younger (HCV vs.
HCV/HIV: 57.3 ± 11.3 vs. 40.7 ± 10.1 years, P < 0.001) and had a higher
proportion of men (HCV vs. HCV/HIV: 54.5% [n = 120] vs. 91.3% [n = 21], P <
0.001) than the HCV-monoinfected patients. Genotype 1b and 2 were most common in 
both HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection groups. HCV-monoinfected patients 
had a higher incidence of genotype 1b and 2 than HCV/HIV-coinfected patients (HCV
vs. HCV/HIV: 95.4% [n = 210] vs. 73.9% [n = 17], P < 0.001), while the
HCV/HIV-coinfected patients had genotype 1a (HCV vs. HCV/HIV: 1.8% [n = 4] vs.
21.7% [n = 5], P < 0.001). The fibrosis-4 index was significantly lower in the
HCV/HIV-coinfected patients than in the HCV-monoinfected patients (HCV vs.
HCV/HIV: 3.81 ± 3.38 vs. 1.66 ± 1.10, P < 0.001). Among the direct-acting
antivirals (DAA)-treated patients, the sustained viral response (SVR) rate did
not differ significantly between both groups (HCV vs. HCV/HIV: 94.9% [93/99] vs. 
90.9% [10/11], P = 0.480).
CONCLUSION: In Korea, the HCV/HIV-coinfected patients who received antiviral
treatment were younger, had higher proportion of men and incidence of genotype
1a, and had less advanced fibrosis than the HCV-monoinfected patients. In actual 
clinical settings, HCV/HIV-coinfected patients show excellent SVR to DAA
treatment, similar to HCV-monoinfected patients.
