There are many reasons why the international community as a whole should advocate
for COVID-19 vaccine equity: global economic recession, uncontrolled outbreaks
with higher risk of virus variants and persistent unsafe travelling in an era of 
now vaccine-preventable cause of death. This inequity is an avoidable threat to
global health. Funding agencies, policy makers, drug companies and NGOs among
others have the moral duty to end this vaccine apartheid and to make vaccine
equity a reality. In this viewpoint, we discuss how inequalities in vaccination
access affect a proper control of the pandemic, highlighting specific
consequences on child health.
