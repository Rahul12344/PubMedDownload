The genome of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease was first sequenced in
January 2020, approximately a month after its emergence in Wuhan, capital of
Hubei province, China. COVID-19 genome sequencing is critical to understanding
the virus behavior, its origin, how fast it mutates, and for the development of
drugs/vaccines and effective preventive strategies. This paper investigates the
use of artificial intelligence techniques to learn interesting information from
COVID-19 genome sequences. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is first applied on a 
computer-understandable corpus of COVID-19 genome sequences to see if interesting
hidden patterns can be found, which reveal frequent patterns of nucleotide bases 
and their relationships with each other. Second, sequence prediction models are
applied to the corpus to evaluate if nucleotide base(s) can be predicted from
previous ones. Third, for mutation analysis in genome sequences, an algorithm is 
designed to find the locations in the genome sequences where the nucleotide bases
are changed and to calculate the mutation rate. Obtained results suggest that SPM
and mutation analysis techniques can reveal interesting information and patterns 
in COVID-19 genome sequences to examine the evolution and variations in COVID-19 
strains respectively.
