There is an ongoing need for new therapeutic modalities against SARS-CoV-2
infection. Mast cell histamine has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
COVID-19 as a regulator of proinflammatory, fibrotic, and thrombogenic processes.
Consequently, mast cell histamine and its receptors represent promising
pharmacological targets. At the same time, nutritional modulation of immune
system function has been proposed and is being investigated for the prevention of
COVID-19 or as an adjunctive strategy combined with conventional therapy. Several
studies indicate that several immunonutrients can regulate mast cell activity to 
reduce the de novo synthesis and/or release of histamine and other mediators that
are considered to mediate, at least in part, the complex pathophysiology present 
in COVID-19. This review summarizes the effects on mast cell histamine of common 
immunonutrients that have been investigated for use in COVID-19.
