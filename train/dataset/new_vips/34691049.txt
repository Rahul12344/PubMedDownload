Background: Little is known about the mortality of hospital-acquired (nosocomial)
COVID-19 infection globally. We investigated the risk of mortality and critical
care admission in hospitalised adults with nosocomial COVID-19, relative to
adults requiring hospitalisation due to community-acquired infection.
Methods: We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed and pre-print literature
from 1/1/2020 to 9/2/2021 without language restriction for studies reporting
outcomes of nosocomial and community-acquired COVID-19. We performed a random
effects meta-analysis (MA) to estimate the 1) relative risk of death and 2)
critical care admission, stratifying studies by patient cohort characteristics
and nosocomial case definition.
Results: 21 studies were included in the primary MA, describing 8,251 admissions 
across 8 countries during the first wave, comprising 1513 probable or definite
nosocomial COVID-19, and 6738 community-acquired cases. Across all studies, the
risk of mortality was 1.3 times greater in patients with nosocomial infection,
compared to community-acquired (95% CI: 1.005 to 1.683). Rates of critical care
admission were similar between groups (Relative Risk, RR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.50 to
1.08). Immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with nosocomial COVID-19 were twice as
likely to die in hospital as those admitted with community-acquired infection
(RR=2.14, 95% CI: 1.76 to 2.61).
Conclusions: Adults who acquire SARS-CoV-2 whilst already hospitalised are at
greater risk of mortality compared to patients admitted following
community-acquired infection; this finding is largely driven by a substantially
increased risk of death in individuals with malignancy or who had undergone
transplantation. These findings inform public health and infection control policy
and argue for individualised clinical interventions to combat the threat of
nosocomial COVID-19, particularly for immunosuppressed groups.
