BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) is
estimated at 1/1000 persons/year. In the pre-Covid-19 era world, OHCA survival
rate in Europe was 7-6%. The main objective is to analyze OHCA survival in the
Lombardy region by highlighting the factors related to both the victims'
characteristics and the chain of survival.
METHODS: All OHCAs were grouped into four pre-established periods in 2019 (14-23 
January; 15-24 April; 15-24 July; 14-23 October). Following the Utstein method,
we selected witnessed OHCAs with presumed cardiac etiology. The outcome of each
case was collected in four moments in time: Return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC), Emergency Department (ED), 24 hours and 30 days. The neurological outcome
30 days after OHCA was also investigated and stratified with theÂ Cerebral
Performance Category Score (CPC).
RESULTS: We selected 456 cases of OHCA with witnessed cardiac etiology. ROSC was 
achieved in 121 cases (26.5%), survival in the Emergency Departments in 110
patients (24.1%), after 24 hours in 86 (18.86%) and after 30 days in 72 (15.8%). 
Male sex was shown to improve OHCA survival. A shockable presentation rhythm,
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) performed by bystanders and the activation of
Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) positively influenced OHCA outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Males are more predisposed to incur an OHCA event than females, but 
they have greater chances of survival. Factors most related to survival are:
shockable rhythm, bystanders CPR and the activation of a PAD.
