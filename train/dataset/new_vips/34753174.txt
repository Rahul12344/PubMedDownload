Thromboembolic events are frequently reported in patients infected with the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The exact mechanisms of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulopathy, 
however, remain elusive. Recently, we observed that platelets (PLTs) from
patients with severe COVID-19 infection express high levels of procoagulant
markers, which were found to be associated with increased risk for thrombosis. In
the current study, we investigated the time course as well as the mechanisms
leading to procoagulant PLTs in COVID-19. Our study demonstrates the presence of 
PLT-reactive IgG antibodies that induce marked changes in PLTs in terms of
increased inner-mitochondrial-transmembrane potential (Δψ) depolarization,
phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and P-selectin expression. The
IgG-induced procoagulant PLTs and increased thrombus formation was mediated by
ligation of PLT Fc gamma RIIA (FcγRIIA). In addition, PLTs´ contents of calcium
and cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) were identified to play central role in
antibody-induced procoagulant PLT formation. Most importantly, antibody-induced
procoagulant events as well as increased thrombus formation in severe COVID-19
were inhibited by Iloprost a clinically approved therapeutic agent that increases
the intracellular cAMP levels in PLTs. Our data indicate that upregulation of
cAMP could be a potential therapeutic target to prevent antibody-mediated
coagulopathy in COVID-19 disease.
