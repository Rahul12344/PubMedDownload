Based on event systems theory, this study examined the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on consumers' impulse buying, as well as the underlying mechanisms and
boundary conditions from the perspective of individual consumers. Results of
three experiments (N = 437) show that, first, the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced
consumers' impulse buying behavior. Second, two key elements, loss of control and
anxiety, mediated the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and impulse
buying; and third, moderate thinking (also known as Zhong-Yong thinking)
moderated the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and impulse buying. The 
findings indicate that in consumers with low moderate thinking, the COVID-19
pandemic has had a stronger effect on impulse buying and has mediated more
between the loss of control and anxiety. Conversely, in consumers with high
moderate thinking, COVID-19 has had a weaker effect on impulse buying and has
mediated less between loss of control and anxiety. This study extends the
application of event systems theory and enriches the literature on how the
COVID-19 pandemic affects consumer behavior. Furthermore, it provides strategic
recommendations for government and consumer responses to COVID-19 pandemic
shocks.
