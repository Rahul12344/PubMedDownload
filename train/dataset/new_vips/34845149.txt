BACKGROUND: Little is known about viral-associated hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in Oman. This study was done to assess the
epidemiology, clinical features and outcome of viral-associated HLH in our
setting.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed children (0-18 years) managed for
viral-associated HLH at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman, over a
15-year period (2006-2020). Patients' medical records were used to describe their
demographic, clinical and laboratory features, management and outcome.
RESULTS: Fifty-six children were managed for HLH at Sultan Qaboos University
Hospital over the last 15 years (2006-2020) of whom a third (19; 34%) had a viral
trigger. The median age at the time of diagnosis of viral-associated HLH was 83
(13-96) months. Fever, cytopenia, hyperferritinemia and evidence of
hemophagocytosis in bone marrow were the most consistent findings. Most of these 
children had either genetic predisposition to HLH (8/19; 42%) or underlying
immunodeficiency secondary to malignant conditions or chemotherapy/hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (6/19; 32%). Epstein-Barr virus (9; 47%) followed by
cytomegalovirus (6; 31%) was the most common viral trigger in our setting.
Treatment included antivirals (8; 42%), HLH 2004 protocol (4; 21%), rituximab (4;
21%) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (3; 16%). Fourteen children
(74%) had full recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: In our small cohort, viral-associated HLH was more frequently
encountered in children with genetic predisposition to HLH or children with
underlying immunodeficiency. In addition, we found that the outcome is overall
good for children who have no genetic predisposition to HLH and children with
genetic predisposition who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
