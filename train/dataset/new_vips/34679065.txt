Betaarterivirus suid 1 and 2 are the causative agents of porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is one of the most significant diseases of the
swine industry, causing significant economic losses in the main pig producing
countries. Here, we report the development of a novel, RNA-based in situ
hybridization technique (RNAscope) to detect PRRS virus (PRRSV) RNA in lung
tissues of experimentally infected animals. The technique was applied to lung
tissues of 20 piglets, which had been inoculated with a wild-type, highly
pathogenic PRRSV-1 strain. To determine the RNAscope's applicability as a
semi-quantitative method, we analysed the association between the proportion of
the virus-infected cells measured with an image analysis software (QuPath) and
the outcome of the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) tests performed in parallel. The results of the quantitative
approach of these two molecular biological methods show significant association
(pseudo R2 = 0.3894, p = 0.004). This is the first time RNAscope assay has been
implemented for the detection of PRRSV-1 in experimental animals.
