The pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe
harm to the health of people all around the world. Molecular detection of the
pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), played a 
crucial role in the control of the disease. Reverse transcription digital PCR
(RT-dPCR) has been developed and used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as an
absolute quantification method. Here, an interlaboratory assessment of
quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was organized by the National Institute of
Metrology, China (NIMC), using in vitro transcribed RNA samples, among ten
laboratories on six different dPCR platforms. Copy number concentrations of three
genes of SARS-CoV-2 were measured by all participants. Consistent results were
obtained with dispersion within 2.2-fold and CV% below 23% among different dPCR
platforms and laboratories, and Z' scores of all the reported results being
satisfactory. Possible reasons for the dispersion included PCR assays, partition 
volume, and reverse transcription conditions. This study demonstrated the
comparability and applicability of RT-dPCR method for quantification of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA and showed the capability of the participating laboratories at
SARS-CoV-2 test by RT-dPCR platform.
