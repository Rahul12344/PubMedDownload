This review summarises the evolution of hepatitis C virus diagnostics over the
past 30 years up to the present. A number of analyses have been used to select
patients for treatment or treatment for patients. In this aspect, HCV is a good
story, since previously the diagnostics required extensive and expensive tests,
but today two to three analyses are sufficient.
