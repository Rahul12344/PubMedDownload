The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
mediates membrane fusion to allow entry of the viral genome into host cells. To
understand its detailed entry mechanism and develop a specific entry inhibitor,
in situ structural information on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in different
states is urgent. Here, by using cryo-electron tomography, we observed both
prefusion and postfusion spikes in Î²-propiolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions
and solved the in situ structure of the postfusion spike at nanometer resolution.
Compared to previous reports, the six-helix bundle fusion core, the glycosylation
sites, and the location of the transmembrane domain were clearly resolved. We
observed oligomerization patterns of the spikes on the viral membrane, likely
suggesting a mechanism of fusion pore formation.
