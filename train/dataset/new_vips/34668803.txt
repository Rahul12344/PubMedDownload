The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the healthcare system
in a major way generally. Healthcare re-organization of resources and manpower,
establishing management protocols and specific patients' pathways are all
evolving with the continuously changing situation. Neuro-vascular management and 
its re-organization are part of these global measures to cope with this pandemic 
in a way to establish less risky patients' pathways, help in patients' triage,
protecting the staff by introducing training and applying safety measures and to 
manage neuro-vascular emergencies and elective activity. We here describe the
situation of the pandemic affecting neuro-vascular interventions and propose our 
recommendations for patients' triage, resources management and organization,
remote solutions and preparations for any future waves.
