Flaviviruses are the major emerging arthropod-borne pathogens globally. However, 
there is still no practical anti-flavivirus approach. Therefore, existing and
emerging flaviviruses desperately need active broad-spectrum drugs. In the
present study, the antiviral effect of steroidal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
and 23 synthetic derivatives against flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Dengue virus (DENV) were appraised by
examining the characteristics of virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Our
results revealed that AV1003, AV1004 and AV1017 were the most potent inhibitors
of flavivirus propagation in cells. They mainly suppress the viral infection in
the post-invasion stage in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, orally
administered compound AV1004 protected mice from lethal JEV infection by
increasing the survival rate and reducing the viral load in the brain of infected
mice. These results indicate that the compound AV1004 might be a potential
therapeutic drug against JEV infection. These DHEA derivatives may provide lead
scaffolds for further design and synthesis of potential anti-flavivirus potential
drugs.
