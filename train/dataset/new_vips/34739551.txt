SARS-CoV-2 is a unique event, having emerged suddenly as a highly infectious
viral pathogen for human populations. Previous phylogenetic analyses show its
closest known evolutionary relative to be a virus detected in bats (RaTG13), with
a common assumption that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a zoonotic ancestor via recent
genetic changes (likely in the Spike protein receptor-binding domain or RBD) that
enabled it to infect humans. We used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral
sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine
the Spike-RBD's functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus
with RaTG13, dating to no later than 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the
human ACE2 receptor. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 likely possessed a latent
capacity to bind to human cellular targets (though this may not have been
sufficient for successful infection) and emphasizes the importance of expanding
efforts to catalog and monitor viruses circulating in both human and non-human
populations.
