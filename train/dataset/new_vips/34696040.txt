Wearable sensing technologies are having a worldwide impact on the creation of
novel business opportunities and application services that are benefiting the
common citizen. By using these technologies, people have transformed the way they
live, interact with each other and their surroundings, their daily routines, and 
how they monitor their health conditions. We review recent advances in the area
of wearable sensing technologies, focusing on aspects such as sensor
technologies, communication infrastructures, service infrastructures, security,
and privacy. We also review the use of consumer wearables during the coronavirus 
disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and we discuss open challenges that must be addressed
to further improve the efficacy of wearable sensing systems in the future.
