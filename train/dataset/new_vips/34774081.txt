BACKGROUND: About two million children live on the streets in Pakistan. Their
complicated past and dire living conditions make them susceptible to many
psychological and physical problems, including sexual abuse.
MAIN BODY: With little research on the topic, the prevalence of sexual
intercourse among street children is reported to be as high as 88% in Pakistan.
With commercial sex a common practice among the street children, public places
such as bus terminals and parks have become foci of prostitution and sexual
exploitation. A growing concern is the spread of HIV/AIDS among the affected
children due to a general lack of awareness about the disease and its prevention 
and high prevalence of unsafe sexual practices. The generally apathetic attitude 
of the society towards this issue and the affected children, combined with a lack
of commitment and limited resource allocation by the government, has contributed 
in deteriorating the situation further.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive multi-pronged strategy involving government,
societal and international stakeholders is crucial to tackle the current crisis.
