BACKGROUND: A pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (COVID 19) incidence data are largely available online. Until August 17, COVID 
19 has hit more than 22 million individuals all over the globe. So, it is urged
to get clear information about the prevalence of the virus. Therefore, one can
manipulate easily a suitable mathematical model to fit these published data.
METHODS: We propose a mathematical model that considers the total population, in 
25 countries, either infected by COVID 19 or confined (safe) during the period
from November 17, 2019, to August 17, 2020. The model considers the total
population as a complex number; the imaginary part is the number of infected
individuals and the real part is the number of confined individuals. This
classification combined with mathematical treatments leads to a transmission
dynamics of the virus to be as wave-like motion. The virus can hit any country
either by one wave or by successive waves (up to 11 waves).
FINDINGS: We find net discrimination between the 25 countries investigated in
this report. The immediate response to the first attack is a substantial
parameter to determine whether the epidemic attack will be in one wave or it can 
be in successive waves. For example, the best case was such as individuals in
China hit by one wave while the individuals in the USA were attacked by nine
waves; it is the worst case all over the globe. In addition, the model
differentiates between the daily reproduction numbers (Rd0) and the median
reproduction number (R0). We have found that Rd0 decreases exponentially with
time from high values down to zero at the wave maximum point; and R0 varies from 
a country to another. For example, the virus hit individuals in Germany in
R0 = 1.39 (96% CI 1.01-3.87) and in the USA R0 = 3.81 (91% CI 1.71-5.15). We have
found that twice the virus has hit both the USA and Iran. The great protestation 
of black matter lives in the USA and the great assemblage of the new Iranian
year, on March 21, 2020, have been the cause of the second epidemic attack in
both countries.
INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID 19 transmission depends on the prompt
reaction against the first viral-wave. The reaction depends on both the social
behaviour of individuals and on the swift system-decision by the governmental
decision-maker(s). The Chinese strictly follow the decision-maker and therefore
the virus hit by only one wave; while in the USA, the system-decision was
different and the American-responses were different, therefore ten waves followed
the first wave.
