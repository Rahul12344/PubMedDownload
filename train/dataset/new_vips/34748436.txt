Evidence shows that those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are at higher
risk for serious illness and mortality from COVID-19. In Kenya, about 50% of the 
COVID-19 patients who have died had an NCD. We sought to describe the challenges 
faced in accessing NCD medicines in Kenya during the pandemic, through a
descriptive narrative informed by key stakeholders engaged in NCD service
delivery and decision-making. Access to NCD medicines was affected at three
levels, service delivery, health facility information systems and the medicines
supply chain to health facilities. In response to these gaps, the Ministry of
Health released clear directives and interim guidelines for continuity of NCD
service delivery. However, implementation of guidelines was not apparent from
conversations with county officials or from assessment of county services by the 
Ministry. Rather, heterogeneity was observed in counties' responsiveness to
patient needs, where 5 out of 13 counties used mHealth technologies, while 5 had 
no established system to reach patients. COVID-19 amplified gaps that already
existed in the system-particularly around lack of robust supply chains and
sub-optimal health information systems. This descriptive paper will be useful to 
policy makers to provide a summary of the key challenges faced in accessing NCD
medicines, identify gaps in medicines delivery, and make case for establishment
of a more equitable health system to meet the needs of lower-income NCD patients.
