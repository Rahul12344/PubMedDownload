Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are a marginalized group having limited
healthcare access and poor-quality care. Inevitably, they are vulnerable to
sexually transmitted infections including hepatitis B virus. It is one of the
most serious and major public health problems, with an increased risk of
transmission and acquisition of the infection. Hence, this study was aimed to
assess the prevalence and associated factors of HBV infection among FSWs in
southern Ethiopia.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from November to February 2019 at 
Hawassa city among ISHDO confidential clinics among 383 FSWs using
respondent-driven consecutive sampling techniques to select study participants
using a standardized questionnaire. The blood samples were collected to detect
viral surface antigen using ELISA. Data were entered into SPSS version 21.
Descriptive and logistic regression analysis was used.
Results: The overall prevalence of HBV was 35 (9.2%) (95% CI=6.3-12.1). Among 381
FSWs, 249 (65.4%) of them had stayed for 2-5 years in sexual work. A total of 240
(63%) of them used condoms consistently during sexual practice. In multivariate
analysis, FSWs who did not use a condom during sexual practice were 6-times more 
at risk than those who used a condom (AOR=6.38, CI=2.04-18.51). Condom breakage
(AOR=2.10, CI=1.95-4.65), use of stimulants (AOR=3.25, CI=1.59-18.63), history of
STI (AOR=2.15, CI=1.02-6.93), and genital ulcer (AOR=4.64, CI=1.31-11.35), number
of sexual partners (AOR=3.25, CI=1.59-7.47), sex during menses (AOR=5.85,
CI=1.29-21.44), sexual assault (AOR=2.93, CI=1.23-9.01), sharp material sharing
(AOR=4.98, CI=1.34-10.95), and history of abortion (AOR=2.46, CI=1.18-12.19) were
statistically associated with HBV infection.
Conclusion: The prevalence of HBV infection in this study was relatively high
compared to the general population. Factors like sociodemographic, behavioral,
and previous information were associated with HBV infection. There is a need for 
ongoing screening of this high-risk population to inform planning for vaccination
and preventive measures.
