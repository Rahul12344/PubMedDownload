OBJECTIVE: To identify the key genes involved in the transformation of hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore the underlying
molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: We analyzed the mRNA microarray data of 119 HBV-related HCC tissues and 
252 HBV-related non-tumor tissues in GSE55092, GSE84044 and GSE121248 from the
GEO database, and the "sva" R package was used to remove the batch effects.
Integration analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) in HBV-related liver cancer and liver tissues with HBV infection. The
significant DEGs were functionally annotated using GO and KEGG analyses, and the 
most important modules and hub genes were explored with STRING analysis.
Kaplan-Meier and Oncomine databases were used to verify the HCC gene expression
data in the TCGA database to explore the correlations of the hub genes with the
occurrence, progression and prognosis of HCC. We also examined the expressions of
the hub genes in 17 pairs of surgical specimens of HCC and adjacent tissues using
RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 121 DEGs and 3 genetic markers in HCC (P <
0.01). These DEGs included cyclin1 (CDK1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), and nuclear
division cycle 80 (NDC80), which participated in cell cycle, pyrimidine
metabolism and DNA replication and were highly correlated (P < 0.05). Analysis of
the UALCAN database confirmed high expressions of these 3 genes in HCC tissues,
which were correlated with a low survival rate of the patients, as shown by
Kaplan-Meier analysis of the prognostic data from the UALCAN database. CDK1,
CCNB1 and NDC80 were all correlated with the clinical grading of HCC (P < 0.05). 
The results of RT-qPCR on the surgical specimens verified significantly higher
expressions of CDK1, CCNB1 and NDC80 mRNA in HCC tissues than in the adjacent
tissues.
CONCLUSION: CDK1, CCNB1 and NDC80 genes can be used as prognostic markers of
HBV-related HCC and may serve as potential targets in preclinical studies and
clinical treatment of HCC.
