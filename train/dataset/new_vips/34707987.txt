Background: In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of the plasma levels
of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
at different treatment stages.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the Data of 206 patients with NPC.
Pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pre-NACT), post-NACT, post-radiotherapy, and
post-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels were used to establish prognostic nomograms.
The concordance index (C-index) and calibration curves were used to compare the
prognostic accuracy of the nomograms. The results were confirmed in a validation 
cohort consisting of patients who were tested for EBV DNA levels at all four
stages of treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Survival differences
were calculated using the log-rank test.
Results: EBV DNA-positive patients had worse 3-year PFS and 5-year OS than EBV
DNA-negative patients; this was true for pre-NACT (PFS: 82.7% vs. 57.3%, P <
0.001; OS: 90.9% vs. 68.7%, P = 0.08) and post-NACT (PFS: 85.0% vs. 50.6%, P <
0.001; OS: 91.7% vs. 65.7%; P = 0.001) EBV DNA levels but not for
post-radiotherapy (PFS: 72.2% vs. 60.9%, P = 0.192; OS: 73.1% vs. 77.2%, P =
0.472) or post-treatment (PFS: 77.3% vs. 59.2%, P = 0.063; OS: 77.5% vs. 79.7%, P
= 0.644) levels. Nomograms combining pre-NACT and post-NACT EBV DNA levels had a 
superior prognostic ability than those of post-radiotherapy and post-treatment
EBV DNA levels.
Conclusion: Pre-NACT EBV DNA levels combined with post-NACT EBV DNA levels can
more reliably predict survival outcomes in patients with NPC.
