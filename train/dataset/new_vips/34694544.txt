BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to compare serum total IgA levels between
severe and mild COVID-19 patients' groups and the control group.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 216 definite severe COVID-19 patients (as
the inpatient group), 183 subjects with positive specific COVID-19 IgG with mild 
or no symptoms as the (outpatient group), and 203 healthy subjects with negative 
specific serology, as the control group were investigated. The cases' laboratory 
data were collected, and thereafter, statistical tests, including independent
samples t test, ANOVA test, and post hoc test, were performed using SPSS software
version 22.
RESULT: The mean ± SD of IgA in all the included subjects was 2.23 ± 0.78 (g/L). 
According to the obtained results, there were statistically significant changes
in IgA among the three study groups (P value < 0.05). This difference was
significant between both outpatient and inpatient groups (P value < 0.05). The
mean ± SD of serum IgG in all the subjects was calculated as 15.83 ± 5.73 (g/L). 
A strong statistically significant change was also seen in IgG among all three
groups (P value < 0.001). Of note, there was a significant negative correlation
between IgG and IgA total titers of the outpatient group (P
value = 0.011*r =  - 0.188).
CONCLUSION: It was shown that the total serum IgA and IgG levels are
significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. As well, we
found that total serum IgA and IgG are associated with the severity of illness.
Since a low level of IgA is asymptomatic and high frequent in Iran and other
countries, we suggest the evaluation of serum IgA levels in high-risk people and 
strengthening immune system in subjects with a low level of IgA, in order to
reduce the rate of death. In this regard, oral or nasal mucosal vaccines in
combination with parenteral vaccination are recommended due to increasing
immunity versus COVID-19 by further secretion of the IgA antibody and preventing 
virus transmission.
