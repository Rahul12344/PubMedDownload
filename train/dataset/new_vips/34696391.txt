Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory
infections in young children and infection has been linked to the development of 
persistent lung disease in the form of wheezing and asthma. Despite substantial
research efforts, there are no RSV vaccines currently available and an effective 
monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV fusion protein (palivizumab) is of limited 
general use given the associated expense. Therefore, the development of novel
approaches to prevent RSV infection is highly desirable to improve pediatric
health globally. We have developed a method to generate alveolar-like macrophages
(ALMs) from pluripotent stem cells. These ALMs have shown potential to promote
airway innate immunity and tissue repair and so we hypothesized that ALMs could
be used as a strategy to prevent RSV infection. Here, we demonstrate that ALMs
are not productively infected by RSV and prevent the infection of epithelial
cells. Prevention of epithelial infection was mediated by two different
mechanisms: phagocytosis of RSV particles and release of an antiviral soluble
factor different from type I interferon. Furthermore, intratracheal
administration of ALMs protected mice from subsequent virus-induced weight loss
and decreased lung viral titres and inflammation, indicating that ALMs can impair
the pathogenesis of RSV infection. Our results support a prophylactic role for
ALMs in the setting of RSV infection and warrant further studies on stem
cell-derived ALMs as a novel cell-based therapy for pulmonary viral infections.
