Life cycle processes of positive-strand (+)RNA viruses are broadly conserved
across families, yet they employ different strategies to grow in the cell. Using 
a generalized dynamical model for intracellular (+)RNA virus growth, we decipher 
these life cycle determinants and their dependencies for several viruses and
parse the effects of viral mutations, drugs and host cell permissivity. We show
that poliovirus employs rapid replication and virus assembly, whereas the
Japanese encephalitis virus leverages its higher rate of translation and
efficient cellular reorganization compared to the hepatitis C virus. Stochastic
simulations demonstrate infection extinction if all seeding (inoculating) viral
RNA degrade before establishing robust replication critical for infection. The
probability of this productive cellular infection, 'cellular infectivity', is
affected by virus-host processes and defined by early life cycle events and viral
seeding. An increase in cytoplasmic RNA degradation and delay in vesicular
compartment formation reduces infectivity, more so when combined. Synergy among
these parameters in limiting (+)RNA virus infection as predicted by our model
suggests new avenues for inhibiting infections by targeting the early life cycle 
bottlenecks.
