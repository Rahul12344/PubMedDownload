Neurological diseases in cattle can be caused by several infectious agents.
Astroviruses are increasingly recognized as the causative agent of encephalitis
in various animals, including humans. In this study, a neuroinvasive astrovirus
(BoAstV 20B05) was discovered in the brain tissues of an 81-month-old Korean
native cattle with neurological symptoms. Lymphocyte infiltration and multifocal 
perivascular cuffing were observed in the cerebrum and brain stem, and viral
antigens were also detected in the meninges. In particular, the concentration of 
the astroviral genome was high in the brain tissues. Korean BoAstV 20B05 was
classified into the CH13/NeuroS1 clade and was closely related to the Neuro-Uy
and KagoshimaSR28-462 strains. Our evolutionary analysis showed that Korean
BoAstV 20B05 belongs to the sub-lineage NeuroS1 and evolved independently of
BoAstV KagoshimaSR28-462. These results suggest that neuroinvasive astroviruses
were first introduced in Korea. However, analysis is limited by the lack of
reference astrovirus sequences reported in various countries within Asia, and
further analysis should be performed using more strains. In this study, we
identified a neuroinvasive astrovirus infection with neurological symptoms for
the first time in South Korea and confirmed that BoAstV 20B05 may have been
introduced in South Korea a long time ago.
