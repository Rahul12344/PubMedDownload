Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has transformed the discovery and
diagnosis of infectious disease, with the power to characterise the complete
'infectome' (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) of an individual host organism.
However, the identification of novel pathogens has been complicated by widespread
microbial contamination in commonly used laboratory reagents. Using total RNA
sequencing ("metatranscriptomics") we documented the presence of contaminant
viral sequences in multiple 'blank' negative control sequencing libraries that
comprise a sterile water and reagent mix. Accordingly, we identified 14 viral
sequences in 7 negative control sequencing libraries. As in previous studies,
several circular replication-associated protein encoding (CRESS) DNA virus-like
sequences were recovered in the blank control libraries, as well as contaminating
sequences from the Totiviridae, Tombusviridae and Lentiviridae families of RNA
virus. These data suggest that viral contamination of common laboratory reagents 
is likely commonplace and can comprise a wide variety of viruses.
