We report the sequences of two West Nile virus (WNV) strains (lineages 1 and 2)
developed by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut as reference materials. The materials are 
calibrated against the 1st World Health Organization WNV RNA International
Standard and are intended for use in nucleic acid technology assays supporting
transfusion safety.
