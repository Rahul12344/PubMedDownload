There is increasing evidence that honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can adapt
naturally to survive Varroa destructor, the primary cause of colony mortality
world-wide. Most of the adaptive traits of naturally varroa-surviving honeybees
concern varroa reproduction. Here we investigate whether factors in the honeybee 
metagenome also contribute to this survival. The quantitative and qualitative
composition of the bacterial and viral metagenome fluctuated greatly during the
active season, but with little overall difference between varroa-surviving and
varroa-susceptible colonies. The main exceptions were Bartonella apis and
sacbrood virus, particularly during early spring and autumn. Bombella apis was
also strongly associated with early and late season, though equally for all
colonies. All three affect colony protein management and metabolism. Lake Sinai
virus was more abundant in varroa-surviving colonies during the summer. Lake
Sinai virus and deformed wing virus also showed a tendency towards seasonal
genetic change, but without any distinction between varroa-surviving and
varroa-susceptible colonies. Whether the changes in these taxa contribute to
survival or reflect demographic differences between the colonies (or both)
remains unclear.
