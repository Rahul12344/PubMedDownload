Knowing the transmission factors and the natural environment that favor the
spread of a viral infection is crucial to stop outbreaks and develop effective
preventive strategies. This work aims to evaluate the role of Particulate Matter 
(PM) in the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing especially on that of PM as a vector for 
SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to PM has been related to new cases and to the clinical
severity of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, which can be explained by the
oxidative stress and the inflammatory response generated by these particles when 
entering the respiratory system, as well as by the role of PM in the expression
of ACE-2 in respiratory cells in human hosts. In addition, different authors have
detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PM sampled both in outdoor and indoor environments.
The results of various studies lead to the hypothesis that the aerosols emitted
by an infected person could be deposited in other suspended particles, sometimes 
of natural but especially of anthropogenic origin, that form the basal PM.
However, the viability of the virus in PM has not yet been demonstrated. Should
PM be confirmed as a vector of transmission, prevention strategies ought to be
adapted, and PM sampling in outdoor environments could become an indicator of
viral load in a specific area.
