The broadly neutralizing antibody PG9 recognizes a unique glycopeptide epitope in
the V1V2 domain of HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein. The present study describes
the design, synthesis, and antibody-binding analysis of HIV-1 V1V2
glycopeptide-Qβ conjugates as a mimic of the proposed neutralizing epitope of
PG9. The glycopeptides were synthesized using a highly efficient chemoenzymatic
method. The alkyne-tagged glycopeptides were then conjugated to the recombinant
bacteriophage (Qβ), a virus-like nanoparticle, through a click reaction.
Antibody-binding analysis indicated that the synthetic glycoconjugates showed
significantly enhanced affinity for antibody PG9 compared with the monomeric
glycopeptides. It was also shown that the affinity of the Qβ-conjugates for
antibody PG9 was dependent on the density of the glycopeptide antigen display.
The glycopeptide-Qβ conjugates synthesized represent a promising candidate of
HIV-1 vaccine.
