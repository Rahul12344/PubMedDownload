BACKGROUND: There are several challenges in designing clinical trials for the
treatment of novel infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. In particular, the
definition of endpoints related to the severity, time frame, and clinical course 
remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of phase III 
randomized trials for COVID-19 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov .
METHODS: We collected the data from ClinicalTrials.gov on March 31, 2021, by
specifying the following search conditions under Advanced Search: Condition or
disease: (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2); Study type: Interventional Studies; Study
Results: All Studies; Recruitment: Not yet recruiting, Recruiting, Enrolling by
invitation, Active, Not recruiting, Suspended, Completed; Sex: All; and Phase:
Phase 3. From the downloaded search results, we selected trials that met the
following criteria: Primary Purpose: Treatment; Allocation: Randomized. We
manually transcribed information not included in the downloaded file, such as
Primary Outcome Measures, Secondary Outcome Measures, Time Frame, and Inclusion
Criteria. In the analysis, we examined primary and secondary endpoints in trials 
with severe and non-severe patients, including the types of endpoints, time
frame, clinical course, and sample size.
RESULTS: A total of 406 trials were included in the analysis. The median numbers 
of endpoints in trials with severe and non-severe patients were 9 and 7,
respectively. Approximately 25% of the trials used multiple primary endpoints.
Regardless of the type of endpoint, the time frames were longer in the trials
with severe patients than in the trials with non-severe patients. In the
evaluation of the clinical course, worsening was often considered in binary
endpoints, and improvement was considered in time-to-event endpoints. The sample 
size was the largest in clinical trials using binary endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Endpoints can differ with respect to severity, and the clinical
course and time frame are important for defining endpoints. This study provides
information that can facilitate the achievement of a consensus for the endpoints 
in evaluating COVID-19 treatments.
