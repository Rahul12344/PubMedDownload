BACKGROUND: Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection is an important
indicator of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in patients with advanced 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Effective antiretroviral therapy
has dramatically reduced the incidence of and mortality due to HIV infection,
although drug resistance and poor medication adherence continue to increase the
risk of disseminated M. avium complex infection. However, gastrointestinal
lesions in cases of disseminated M. avium complex infection resulting in
protein-losing enteropathy have been rarely discussed. Therefore, we present a
case of protein-losing enteropathy caused by disseminated M. avium complex
infection in a patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old man was diagnosed with AIDS 4 years ago and was 
admitted for a 10-month history of refractory diarrhea and fever. Despite
receiving antiretroviral therapy, the viral load remained elevated due to poor
medication adherence. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated M. avium
complex infection and started on antimycobacterial drugs 2 years before
admission. However, the infection remained uncontrolled. The previous
hospitalization 1 year before admission was due to hypoalbuminemia and refractory
diarrhea. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a diagnosis of protein-losing
enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia, and treatment with intravenous
antimycobacterial drugs did not resolve his intestinal lymphangiectasia. The
patient inevitably died of sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical remission is difficult to achieve in patients with AIDS and
protein-losing enteropathy caused by disseminated M. avium complex infection due 
to limited options of parenteral antiretroviral drugs. This report highlights the
importance of identifying alternative treatments (such as an injectable
formulation) for patients who do not respond to antiretroviral therapy due to
protein-losing enteropathy with disseminated M. avium complex infection.
