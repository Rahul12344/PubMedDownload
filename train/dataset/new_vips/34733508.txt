Background: Hepatitis C is highly prevalent among people who use drugs (PWUD),
and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic is less characterised in Norway. The
aims of the study were to assess the prevalence and treatment willingness in
high-risk populations by reaching out to frequently visited sites for high-risk
populations.
Methods: Individuals from high-risk populations were included from September 2015
to March 2017. Two dedicated study nurses frequently visited the local opioid
substitution clinic, outpatient clinics, PWUD day centres, local prison, and
refugee centre in Trondheim, Norway. Demographic data, risk behaviour, and
clinical symptoms were obtained by study questionnaire. Subjects with anti-HCV+
rapid test were subsequently tested for HCV RNA and genotyped. Viraemic patients 
were offered referral for HCV treatment evaluation.
Results: A total of 381 participants were included in the study: 52 immigrants,
62 prisoners, and 267 PWUD. The anti-HCV prevalence rates were 0% (n = 0) in
immigrants, 40% (n = 25) in prisoners, and 61% (n = 164) in PWUD, with 24%
(n = 15) of prisoners and 42% (n = 108) of PWUD being viraemic. Of those
qualifying for treatment (n = 31), 30 wished to be evaluated.
Conclusion: This study showed high HCV prevalence in prisoners and PWUD and that 
infected high-risk patients were interested in treatment evaluation.
