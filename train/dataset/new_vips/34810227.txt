BACKGROUND: Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug is prescribed nowadays for
COVID-19. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated efficacy and safety of colchicine
in patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We searched databases for randomised controlled studies evaluating
efficacy and/or safety of colchicine as compared with supportive care in patients
with COVID-19. The efficacy outcomes were mortality, ventilatory support,
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay. The safety
outcomes were adverse events, serious adverse events and diarrhoea. A
meta-analytical summary was estimated using random effects model through
Mantle-Hanzle method. An I2 test was used to assess heterogeneity. The Grades of 
Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used 
to assess quality of evidence for each outcome.
RESULTS: Out of 69 full texts assessed, 6 studies (16148 patients with COVID-19) 
were included in meta-analysis. Patients receiving colchicine did not show
significant reduction in mortality (risk difference, RD -0.00 (95% CI -0.01 to
0.01), I2=15%), ventilatory support (risk ratio, RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.21),
I2=47%), ICU admission (RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.25), I2=34%), length of
hospital stay (mean difference: -1.17 (95% CI -3.02 to 0.67), I2=77%) and serious
adverse events (RD -0.01 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.00), I2=28%) than those who received 
supportive care only. Patients receiving colchicine had higher rates of adverse
events (RR 1.58 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.33), I2=81%) and diarrhoea (RR 1.93 (95% CI
1.62 to 2.29), I2=0%) than supportive care treated patients. The GRADE quality of
evidence was moderate for most outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The moderate quality evidence suggests no benefit of addition of
colchicine to the standard care regimen in patients with COVID-19.
