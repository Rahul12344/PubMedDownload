The presence of latently infected cells and reservoirs in HIV-1 infected patients
constitutes a significant obstacle to achieve a definitive cure. Despite the
efforts dedicated to solve these issues, the mechanisms underlying viral latency 
are still under study. Thus, on the one hand, new strategies are needed to
elucidate which factors are involved in latency establishment and maintenance. On
the other hand, innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at eradicating HIV
infection are explored. In this context, advances of the versatile CRISPR-Cas
gene editing technology are extremely promising, by providing, among other
advantages, the possibility to target the HIV-1 genome once integrated into
cellular DNA (provirus) and/or host-specific genes involved in virus
infection/latency. This system, up to now, has been employed with success in
numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, highlighting its increasing significance
in the field. In this review, we focus on the progresses made in the use of
different CRISPR-Cas strategies to target the HIV-1 provirus, and we then discuss
recent advancements in the use of CRISPR screens to elucidate the role of
host-specific factors in viral latency.
