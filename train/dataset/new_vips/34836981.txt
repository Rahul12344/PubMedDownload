It has been necessary to use methods that can detect the specificity of a virus
during virus screening. In this study, we use a dual platform to identify any
spiked virus and specific SARS-CoV-2 antigen, sequentially. We introduce a
natural bed-receptor surface as Microparticle Vesicle-Galactins1 (MV-gal1) with
the ability of glycan binding to screen every spiked virus. MV are the native
vesicles which may have the gal-1 receptor. Gal-1 is the one of lectin receptor
which can bind to glycan. After dropping the MV-gal1 on the SCPE/GNP, the sensor 
is turned on due to the increased electrochemical exchange with [Fe(CN)6]-3/-4
probe. Dropping the viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 cause to turn off the sensor
with covering the sugar bond (early screening). Then, with the addition of
Au/Antibody-SARS-CoV-2 on the MV-gal1@SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the sensor is turned on
again due to the electrochemical amplifier of AuNP (specific detection).For the
first time, our sensor has the capacity of screening of any spike virus, and the 
specific detection of COVID-19 (LOD: 4.57 × 102 copies/mL) by using the natural
bed-receptor and a specific antibody in the point of care test.
