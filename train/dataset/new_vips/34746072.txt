The use of face masks is one of the behavioral measures used to prevent COVID-19 
infection. Despite the positive contribution of face masks, there is uncertainty 
surrounding face mask wearing in low-income countries. Using data from 1,054
respondents in Greater Kampala Metropolitan area, we investigate the variation in
face mask wearing inside and outside public spaces. Results indicate that more
than three quarters of the respondents wore a face mask always outside public
spaces and slightly more than half wore a face mask sometimes inside public
spaces. Irrespective of location (inside or outside public spaces), respondents
were more likely to wear facemasks sometimes or always to prevent COVID-19
infection. There is need to raise awareness about face mask wearing and its
efficacy to prevent COVID-19 infection.
