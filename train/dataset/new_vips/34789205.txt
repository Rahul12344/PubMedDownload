BACKGROUND: Previous research has indicated that demographic differences affect
COVID-19 vaccination rates. Trust, in both the vaccine itself and institutional
trust, is one possible factor. The present study examines racial differences in
institutional trust and vaccine status among a nationally representative sample
of adults in the United States.
METHODS: Data for the current study was collected as part of Wave 8 Omnibus 2000 
survey conducted by RAND ALP and consisted of 2080 participants. Responses were
collected through the online RAND ALP survey in March 2021.
RESULTS: Trust in the scientific community was the strongest predictor for
already receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the time of study.
Asians had a significantly higher trust in the scientific community compared to
all other groups. Results also showed a significant difference in level of trust 
of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with Indian/Alaskan Natives
reporting lower trust compared to Whites, Blacks and Asians. Asians also had a
significantly higher level of trust when compared to those who identified as
racial Other. Those who identify as American Indian/Alaskan Natives had the
lowest levels of institutional trust. Trust in the government's response was not 
indicative of vaccination within the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to increase trust of the scientific community can be
employed to address vaccine hesitancy through community-based initiatives and
building of partnerships between the scientific community and local community
stakeholders.
