Background: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute enterovirus-induced
disease. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been identified as a factor that plays an
important role in enteral virus infection, but the gut microbiota profile in
hand, foot and mouth disease has rarely been studied in a large population.
Methods: A total of 749 children (HFMD: n = 262, healthy control: n = 487) aged 2
to 7 years were recruited from hospitals and communities in the period from May
to July, 2017. Clinical and demographical information was collected by trained
personnel, and fecal samples were collected and processed for 16S ribosomal
RNA(rRNA) gene sequencing.
Results: We observed a significant alteration in the microbiota profile of
children with HFMD compared with that of control children. Patients with
enteroviruses A71(EV71) positive had more dysbiotic gut microbiota than those
with coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16) positive. We found that Prevotella and
Streptococcus were enriched in children with HFMD, whereas beneficial bacteria,
including Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium, were depleted. Children with
synbiotics supplements had lower risk of HFMD and we observed that the gut
microbiota of HFMD patients who were administered synbiotics exhibited potential 
resistance to the dysbiosis detected in HFMD.
Conclusions: This study suggested that the gut microbiota of patients with hand, 
foot and mouth disease exhibits dysbiosis and that synbiotics supplements
potentially helps maintain the homeostasis of the gut flora.
