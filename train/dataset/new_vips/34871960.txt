BACKGROUND: As vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are now being rolled out, a better
understanding of immunity to the virus, whether from infection, or passive or
active immunisation, and the durability of this protection is required. This will
benefit from the ability to measure antibody-based protection to SARS-CoV-2,
ideally with rapid turnaround and without the need for laboratory-based testing.
METHODS: We have developed a lateral flow POC test that can measure levels of
RBD-ACE2 neutralising antibody (NAb) from whole blood, with a result that can be 
determined by eye or quantitatively on a small instrument. We compared our
lateral flow test with the gold-standard microneutralisation assay, using samples
from convalescent and vaccinated donors, as well as immunised macaques.
FINDINGS: We show a high correlation between our lateral flow test with
conventional neutralisation and that this test is applicable with animal samples.
We also show that this assay is readily adaptable to test for protection to newly
emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the beta variant which revealed a marked 
reduction in NAb activity. Lastly, using a cohort of vaccinated humans, we
demonstrate that our whole-blood test correlates closely with microneutralisation
assay data (specificity 100% and sensitivity 96% at a microneutralisation cutoff 
of 1:40) and that fingerprick whole blood samples are sufficient for this test.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, the COVID-19 NAb-testTM device described here
provides a rapid readout of NAb based protection to SARS-CoV-2 at the point of
care.
