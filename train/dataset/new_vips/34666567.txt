High morbidity and mortality caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) the
leading challenge for health experts all over the world. Currently, there is no
specific treatment for COVID-19; however, thanks to worldwide intense attempts,
novel vaccines such as mRNA-1273 (Moderna TX, Inc.) and BNT162b2
(Biontech/Pfizer) were developed very fast and FDA approved them for emergency
use. Nanomedicine-based drug delivery can be an advanced therapeutic strategy to 
deal with clinical complications of COVID-19. Given the fact that SARS-CoV-2
typically affects the respiratory tract, application of inhalable nanoparticles
(NPs) for targeted drug delivery to the alveolar space appears to be an effective
and promising therapeutic strategy. Loading the medicinal components into NPs
enhances the stability, bioavailability, solubility and sustained release of
them. This approach can circumvent major challenges in efficient drug delivery
such as solubility and any adverse impact of medicinal components due to
off-targeted delivery and resulting systemic complications. Inhalable NPs could
be delivered through nasal sprays, inhalers, and nebulizers. NPs also could
interfere in virus attachment to host cells and prevent infection. Moreover,
nanomedicine-based technologies can facilitate accurate and rapid detection of
virus compared to the conventional methods. In this review, the nano-based
theranostics modalities for the management of respiratory complications of
COVID-19 were discussed.
