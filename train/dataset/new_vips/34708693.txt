Introduction: At the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the
publications on managing surgical emergencies were sparse. Health care personnel 
were facing an unprecedented problem with limited information. On this
background, we have reviewed the operational challenges faced and the protocols
followed by us while managing emergency surgical patients. The clinical
presentations, RT-PCR testing rates, trend of COVID-19 positivity in emergency
surgical patients and its comparison to the general population, swab positivity
among screen positive and negative patients, grade of COVID-19 affection, the
outcomes in emergency surgical patients, and COVID-19 affection in treating
personnel is studied.
Patients and Methods: A protocol for triaging patients at presentation into
screen positive or negative for COVID-19 was instituted. A proforma for all
admitted patients over the period of March 2020 to August 2020 was maintained. A 
retrospective review of this data was carried out after Institutional Ethics
Committee permission.
Results: A total of 222 patients presented to the surgical emergency, of which
110 required admission. Of the admitted patients, 28 were COVID-19 positive. The 
positivity amongst admitted and operated patients increased to 50% and 66.67%,
respectively in August. The difference in mortality rate amongst the operated
COVID-19 positive (11.1%) and negative (14.28%) patients was nonsignificant. None
of the treating doctors had to be quarantined during this period.
Conclusions: The number of COVID-19 positive patients rose serially over the
study period. The outcome was not affected by the COVID-19 status in mild cases. 
A high rate of COVID-19 positivity was seen in patients requiring emergency
surgery. Universal precautions ensured delivering treatment to emergency patients
in standard time. Testing should continue for all as screening alone is not
effective as the virus spreads into the population. Proper protocols helped us to
protect the health care workers.
