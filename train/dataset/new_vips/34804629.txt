Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
recently emergent coronavirus of natural origin and caused the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The study of its natural origin and host range is of
particular importance for source tracing, monitoring of this virus, and
prevention of recurrent infections. One major approach is to test the binding
ability of the viral receptor gene ACE2 from various hosts to SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to cover a large collection
of species.
Methods: In this paper, we applied state-of-the-art machine learning approaches
and created a pipeline reaching >87% accuracy in predicting binding between
different ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike.
Results: We further validated our prediction pipeline using 2 independent test
sets involving >50 bat species and achieved >78% accuracy. A large-scale
screening of 204 mammal species revealed 144 species (or 61%) were susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infections, highlighting the importance of intensive monitoring and
studies in mammalian species.
Discussion: In short, our study employed machine learning models to create an
important tool for predicting potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and achieved the
highest precision to our knowledge in experimental validation. This study also
predicted that a wide range of mammals were capable of being infected by
SARS-CoV-2.
