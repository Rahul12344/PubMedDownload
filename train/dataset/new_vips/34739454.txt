Between August and September 2021, the European Court of Human Rights rejected
three requests for interim measures against France and Greece's compulsory
vaccination statutes against COVID-19. Due to the procedural nature of the
interim measures, however, the status of vaccine mandates against SARS-CoV-2
under the European Convention of Human Rights has not been addressed. The paper
argues that COVID-19 compulsory vaccination is consistent with both the text and 
the original understanding of Article 8 of the Convention. Moreover, considering 
pertinent case law on medical mandatory treatments, COVID-19 vaccine mandates
should also square with the European Court of Human Right's "living instrument"
doctrine. For this reason, it is expected that the European Court of Human rights
will uphold COVID-19 vaccination programs. At the same time, it would be
beneficial if more Council of Europe member states triggered Article 15
derogation mechanism in order to make an even stronger case for fast-track
developed vaccines and contrast vaccine hesitancy.
