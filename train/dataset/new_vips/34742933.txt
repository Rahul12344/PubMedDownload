BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are enteric viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis
worldwide. Over two decades, GII.4 genotype was responsible for most cases.
However, recombinant strains have emerged and changed the epidemiological context
of these infections.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the recombinant genetic strains
of norovirus causing gastroenteritis in Brazilian children from the Amazon
region.
METHODS: We analyzed 534 cases of gastroenteritis between 2015 and 2016.
Genotypic characterization was performed by partial sequencing of ORF1 and ORF2. 
Evolutionary history was inferred by Bayesian inference using MrBayes.
Recombinant strains were confirmed by Simplot and RDP4 analysis.
FINDINGS: We performed viral detection tests and identified a norovirus frequency
of 31.8% (175/534). Based on viral RdRp and VP1 genes, nine genotypes were
identified: GIIP31/GII.4, GII·P16/GII.4, GII·P7/GII.6, GII·P21/GII.13,
GII·P33/GII.1, GII·P17/GII.17, GI·P7/GI.7, GII·P4/NT, and GII.7/NT. The
phylogenetic tree showed evolutionary relationships among the genotypes,
including the recombinant strains. This is the first description of GII·P33/GII.1
and GII·P21/GII.13 genotypes in Brazil.
CONCLUSION: Norovirus evolution has been characterized by the continuous
replacement of variants that have new antigenic properties. In recent years,
recombinant strains have displaced GII.4, improving the viral fitness and
influencing the viral transmissibility and pathogenicity.
