In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a health crisis 
in Wuhan, China, and was later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As it spread and its death
toll increased, on the 11th of March 2020 it was declared a pandemic at 4,369
deaths worldwide, and cases and deaths have since surged. With gender disparities
already known to leave women and their health at the margins of society during
outbreaks, it is important to understand how COVID-19 affects women's health. In 
this article, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic can create vulnerabilities for
women and their health and further exacerbate long-existing inequalities and
social disparities. These include gender-based roles, economic and food security,
violence, work pressure, and access to health and healthcare facilities. These
issues have significant repercussions on the physical and mental health of women.
To focus our lenses on these issues, we draw lessons from three specific examples
of past outbreaks: 1918 Flu pandemic, Zika virus disease, and Ebola virus
disease. We conclude by stating how public health responses and strategies for
COVID-19 can be inclusive to women's health.
