Severe status of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is extremely associated to
cytokine release. Moreover, it has been suggested that blood group is also
associated with the prevalence and severity of this disease. However, the
relationship between the cytokine profile and blood group remains unclear in
COVID-19 patients. In this sense, we prospectively recruited 108 COVID-19
patients between March and April 2020 and divided according to ABO blood group.
For the analysis of 45 cytokines, plasma samples were collected in the time of
admission to hospital ward or intensive care unit and at the sixth day after
hospital admission. The results show that there was a risk of more than two times
lower of mechanical ventilation or death in patients with blood group O (log
rank: p = 0.042). At first time, all statistically significant cytokine levels,
except from hepatocyte growth factor, were higher in O blood group patients
meanwhile the second time showed a significant drop, between 20% and 40%. In
contrast, A/B/AB group presented a maintenance of cytokine levels during time.
Hepatocyte growth factor showed a significant association with intubation or
mortality risk in non-O blood group patients (OR: 4.229, 95% CI (2.064-8.665), p 
< 0.001) and also was the only one bad prognosis biomarker in O blood group
patients (OR: 8.852, 95% CI (1.540-50.878), p = 0.015). Therefore, higher
cytokine levels in O blood group are associated with a better outcome than A/B/AB
group in COVID-19 patients.
