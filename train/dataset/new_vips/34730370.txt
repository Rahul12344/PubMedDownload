Phrymarolin II, a furofuran lignan isolated from Phryma leptostachya L., features
a 3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton. Herein, we report an alternative total 
synthesis of (±)-phrymarolin II (2), which was performed in 9 steps from
commercially available sesamol. The key steps of the synthesis included a
zinc-mediated Barbier-type allylation and a copper-catalyzed anomeric
O-arylation. Our total synthesis allowed the synthesis of analogues of
(±)-phrymarolin II. Most derivatives displayed good to excellent in vivo activity
against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). (±)-Phrymarolin II (2) and compounds (±)-31d 
and (±)-31g exhibited similar or higher activity than commercial ningnanmycin,
which indicated that phrymarolin lignans are a promising new class of plant virus
inhibitors.
