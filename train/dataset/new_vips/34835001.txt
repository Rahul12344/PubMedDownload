The livestock industry supports livelihood and nutritional security of at least
42% of people in the Southern African Development Community region. However,
presence of animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease poses a major threat
to the development of this industry. Samples collected from FMD outbreaks in
Zambia during 2015-2020, comprising epithelial tissues samples (n = 47) and sera 
(n = 120), were analysed. FMD virus was serotyped in 26 samples, while 92 sera
samples tested positive on NSP-ELISA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed notable
changes in the epidemiology of FMD in Zambia, which included: (i) introduction of
a novel FMDV SAT-3 (topotype II) causing FMD cases in cattle in Western Province;
(ii) emergence of FMDV serotype O (topotype O/EA-2) in Central, Southern,
Copperbelt, Western, Lusaka Provinces; and (iii) new outbreaks due to SAT -2
(topotypes I) in Eastern Zambia. Together, these data describe eight different
epizootics that occurred in Zambia, four of which were outside the known FMD
high-risk areas. This study highlights the complex epidemiology of FMD in Zambia,
where the country represents an interface between East Africa (Pool 4) and
Southern Africa (Pool 6). These changing viral dynamics have direct impacts on
FMD vaccine selection in the SADC region.
