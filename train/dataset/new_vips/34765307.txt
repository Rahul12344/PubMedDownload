Gastric cancer (GC) patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity have
demonstrated promising response with immunotherapy. We assessed the efficacy and 
safety of camrelizumab as salvage treatment in EBV-positive mGC. In this
single-arm, phase 2 prospective clinical trial (NCT03755440), stage IV
EBV-positive GC patients who failed/could not tolerate previous lines of
chemotherapy were given intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg every 2 weeks until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective 
response rate. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and toxicity.
Exploratory analysis included the associations between treatment response and
tumor mutation burden (TMB), programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression.
Six eligible patients were enrolled in the first stage of the study. No patient
achieved an objective response; thus, the study did not proceed to the second
stage. The DCR was 67% (4/6). The median PFS rate was 2.2 months (95% CI: 1.5-not
reached [NR]) and median OS was 6.8 months (95% CI: 1.7-NR). All
treatment-related adverse events were grade 1-2, with reactive cutaneous
capillary endothelial proliferation (n=4 [67%]) being the most commonly observed 
event. The only patient with PD-L1 combined positive score >1 had disease
progression. Two stable disease and one disease progression were observed in
three patients with TMB >10 Mut/Mb. EBV positivity may not be a good predictor
for response to camrelizumab in mGC. Newer biomarkers are needed to identify
EBV-positive mGC respondents who might benefit from immunotherapy.
