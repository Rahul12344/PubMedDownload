Cancer is a leading cause of death and a major health problem worldwide,
particularly in more developed countries. There is, therefore, an urgent clinical
need to develop more effective therapies to treat cancer and metastatic disease. 
In this Editorial, the content of The FEBS Journal's Special Issue on Cancer
Therapeutics is outlined. The interesting collection of recent articles in this
issue covers a wide repertoire of cancer therapeutic approaches. While some of
the articles discuss broad-spectrum applications such as immunotherapy and
oncolytic virus therapy, others focus on a particular type of cancer or a
signalling pathway that has gone awry such as aberrant Ca2+ signalling,
glycosylation or pre-mRNA processing. Finally, an article featured in this issue 
reviews our current understanding of how cancer cells can become dormant, often
for decades, and which pathways reactivate these cells to cause relapse. I am
sure there is something for everyone in this issue.
