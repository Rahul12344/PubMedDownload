BACKGROUND: As war and famine are population level stressors that have been
historically linked to menstrual cycle abnormalities, we hypothesized that the
COVID-19 pandemic could similarly affect ovulation and menstruation among women.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining changes in
ovulation and menstruation among women using the Natural Cycles mobile tracking
app. We compared de-identified cycle data from March-September 2019
(pre-pandemic) versus March-September 2020 (during pandemic) to determine
differences in the proportion of users experiencing anovulation, abnormal cycle
length, and prolonged menses, as well as population level changes in these
parameters, while controlling for user-reported stress during the pandemic.
FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 214,426 cycles from 18,076 app users, primarily
from Great Britain (29.3%) and the United States (22.6%). The average user was 33
years of age; most held at least a university degree (79.9%). Nearly half (45.4%)
reported more pandemic-related stress. Changes in average cycle and menstruation 
lengths were not clinically significant, remaining at 29 and 4 days,
respectively. Approximately 7.7% and 19.5% of users recorded more anovulatory
cycles and abnormal cycle lengths during the pandemic, respectively. Contrary to 
expectation, 9.6% and 19.6% recorded fewer anovulatory cycles and abnormal cycle 
lengths, respectively. Women self-reporting more (32.0%) and markedly more
(13.6%) stress during the pandemic were not more likely to experience cycle
abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVD-19 pandemic did not induce population-level changes to
ovulation and menstruation among women using a mobile app to track menstrual
cycles and predict ovulation. While some women experienced abnormalities during
the pandemic, this proportion was smaller than that observed prior to the
pandemic. As most app users in this study were well-educated women over the age
of 30 years, and from high-income countries, their experience of the COVID-19
pandemic might differ in ways that limit the generalizability of these findings.
