Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally;
recognition of immune responses to this virus will be crucial for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) control, prevention and treatment. We comprehensively
analysed IgG and IgA antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
(N), spike protein domain 1 (S1) and envelope protein (E) in: SARS-CoV-2-infected
patient, healthy, historical and pre-epidemic samples, including patients'
medical, epidemiological and diagnostic data, virus-neutralizing capability and
kinetics. N-specific IgG and IgA are the most reliable diagnostic targets for
infection. Serum IgG levels correlate to IgA levels. Half a year after infection,
anti-N and anti-S1 IgG decreased, but sera preserved virus-inhibitory potency;
thus, testing for IgG may underestimate the protective potential of antibodies.
Historical and pre-epidemic sera did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2, thus its circulation
before the pandemic and a protective role from antibodies pre-induced by other
coronaviruses cannot be confirmed by this study.
