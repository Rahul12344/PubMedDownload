Approximately 100-400 million people from more than 100 countries in the tropical
and subtropical world are affected by dengue infections. Recent scientific
breakthroughs have brought new insights into novel strategies for the production 
of dengue antivirals and vaccines. The search for specific dengue inhibitors is
expanding, and the mechanisms for evaluating the efficacy of novel drugs are
currently established, allowing for expedited translation into human trials.
Furthermore, in the aftermath of the only FDA-approved vaccine, Dengvaxia, a
safer and more effective dengue vaccine candidate is making its way through the
clinical trials. Until an effective antiviral therapy and licensed vaccine are
available, disease monitoring and vector population control will be the mainstays
of dengue prevention. In this article, we highlighted recent advances made in the
perspectives of efforts made recently, in dengue vaccine development and dengue
antiviral drug.
