OBJECTIVE: People who inject drugs (PWID) have high hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection prevalence but low rates of HCV treatment uptake. To better harness the
potential of peer-led social network-based interventions to increase HCV
treatment uptake among PWID, simple tools that can help identify individuals with
the potential to function effectively as peer-mentors who support network members
to get HCV tested and linked to care are needed.
METHODS: Data from a survey administered to index PWID enrolled in a social
network-based intervention, in which they were invited to recruit drug use
network members for HCV testing and linkage to care, was analyzed. Constructs
derived from exploratory factor analysis were validated through confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA). We used logistic regression analysis to assess the
association between scores in identified constructs and subsequent effectiveness 
in the peer mentor role, defined as recruiting at least one network member for
HCV testing and linkage to care in the 12 weeks following survey completion.
RESULTS: Among 100 PWID with median age 53 years, 74% male, and 71% Black, CFA
resulted in a multidimensional three-factor survey with 4 questions related to
opinion leadership, 3 questions related to perceived HCV-related stigma, and 3
questions related to HCV communication comfort and care support willingness. Only
self-designated opinion leadership was associated with effectiveness in the peer 
mentor role (adjusted odds ratio 3.76 (95% Confidence interval CI 1.01, 14.0)).
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a simple tool with potential to ease and
improve the efficiency of peer-led social network interventions.
