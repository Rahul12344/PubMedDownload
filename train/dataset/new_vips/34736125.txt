India, with around 15 million COVID-19 cases, recently became the second
worst-hit nation by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, we analyzed the
mutation and selection landscape of 516 unique and complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2
isolates from India in a 12-month span (from Jan to Dec 2020) to understand how
the virus is evolving in this geographical region. We identified 953 genome-wide 
loci displaying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the Principal Component 
Analysis and mutation plots of the datasets indicate an increase in genetic
variance with time. The 42% of the polymorphic sites display substitutions in the
third nucleotide position of codons indicating that non-synonymous substitutions 
are more prevalent. These isolates displayed strong evidence of purifying
selection in ORF1ab, spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane glycoprotein. We also find
some evidence of localized positive selections ORF1ab, spike glycoprotein, and
nucleocapsid. The CDSs for ORF3a, ORF8, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and spike
glycoprotein were found to evolve at rapid rate. This study will be helpful in
understanding the dynamics of rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2.
