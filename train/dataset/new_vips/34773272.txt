BACKGROUND: Data are limited regarding the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
reinfection after treatment-induced sustained virologic response (SVR) in
patients on haemodialysis.
AIMS: To assess the risk of HCV reinfection among patients on haemodialysis with 
treatment-induced SVR.
METHODS: Patients on haemodialysis patients who achieved SVR12 with interferon
(IFN) or direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment received follow-up at
SVR24 and then biannually with HCV RNA measurements. HCV reinfection was defined 
as the resurgence of viremia by different viral strains beyond SVR12 . The
low-risk general population who achieved SVR12 and who underwent the same
post-SVR12 surveillance served as the reference group. Crude reinfection rates
per 100 person-years (PYs) were calculated. Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
was performed to estimate the relative risk of HCV reinfection between the two
groups.
RESULTS: We recruited 374 patients on haemodialysis and 1571 reference patients
with a mean post-SVR12 follow-up of 4.7 and 6.1 years. All haemodialysis patients
who achieved SVR12 also achieved SVR24 . The incidence rates of HCV reinfection
were 0.23 per 100 PYs (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09-0.59) in haemodialysis 
patients and 0.16 per 100 PYs (95% CI: 0.10-0.26) in the reference group. The
risk of HCV reinfection in patients on haemodialysis was comparable to that in
the reference patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.39; 95% CI: 0.44-4.38, P = 0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of HCV reinfection in patients on haemodialysis who achieve
SVR12 is low and comparable to that in the low-risk general population. HCV
microelimination in this special population is feasible once universal screening 
and scaled-up treatment are implemented.
