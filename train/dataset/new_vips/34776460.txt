MicroRNAs (miRNAs) classified as non-coding RNAs regulate various metabolic
systems and viral life cycles. To date, numerous DNA viruses, many of which are
members of the herpesvirus family, and a relatively small number of RNA viruses, 
including retroviruses, have been reported to encode and express miRNAs in
infected cells. A few retroviruses have been shown to express miRNAs, and foamy
viruses (FVs) were initially predicted by computational analyses to possess
miRNA-coding regions. Subsequent studies on simian and bovine FVs confirmed the
presence of functional and biologically active miRNA expression cassettes. We
herein identified feline FV-derived miRNAs using a small RNA deep sequencing
ana-lysis. We confirmed their repressive functions on gene expression by
dual-luciferase reporter assays. We found that the seed sequences of the miRNAs
identified in the present study were conserved among all previously reported FFV 
isolates. These results suggest that FFV-derived miRNAs play a pivotal role in
FFV infection.
