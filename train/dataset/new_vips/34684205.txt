A perhabdovirus was isolated from a mortality episode affecting a fish farm in
2019 in Western Europe. This virus was produced in cell culture and was readily
detected by a species-specific real-time PCR assay. The near-complete sequence of
the virus obtained showed some relatedness with viruses of the species
Perhabdovirus perca. However, it was distinct enough from these viruses to form a
separate genetic lineage. Multiple substitutions along the genome caused
non-detection using a range of conventional PCRs previously shown to target four 
known genogroups of perhabdoviruses. However, various generic PCRs efficiently
detected the isolated virus. The origin of this virus remains to be elucidated.
It may have been introduced into the farm via wild genitors. This finding
provides new evidence of the high genetic diversity of percid perhabdoviruses and
the potential of new genotypes to emerge as threats for fish farming. Efforts to 
improve the existing diagnostic methods and control this large group of viruses
are still needed.
