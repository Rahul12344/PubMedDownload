PURPOSE: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis is rare. Some studies have
suggested that the incidence is increasing but the available literature is
equivocal. We examined the incidence of high-grade penile intraepithelial
neoplasia (PeIN), the incidence and 5-year relative survival as well as mortality
of penile SCC in Denmark over the latest 20 years.
METHODS: New cases of high-grade PeIN and penile cancer were identified from
high-quality nationwide registries. Age-standardized (World) incidence rates per 
100,000 person-years and average annual percentage change (AAPC) were estimated. 
For penile SCC, 5-year relative survival was calculated, and Cox regression was
used to examine the effect of selected characteristics on mortality.
RESULTS: Altogether, 1,070 new cases of high-grade PeIN were diagnosed
(1997-2018) and the incidence increased from 0.87 to 1.84 per 100,000
person-years from 1997-1998 to 2017-2018 (AAPC = 4.73; 95% CI: 3.54-5.94). We
identified 1,216 penile cancer cases (1997-2018) (95.7% SCC). The incidence of
penile SCC increased slightly from 0.85 per 100,000 person-years in 1997-1998 to 
1.13 per 100,000 person-years in 2017-2018 (AAPC = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.24-1.79). The 
5-year relative survival of penile SCC did not change substantially, whereas the 
mortality tended to decrease.
CONCLUSION: Penile SCC is increasing slightly in Denmark, while a pronounced
increase in the incidence of high-grade PeIN is seen. The 5-year relative
survival from penile cancer was relatively stable over time. Increasing exposure 
to HPV infection at the population level may have contributed to the observed
increase in PeIN and penile SCC. Awareness of HPV may also have contributed to
the increased detection of PeIN.
