PURPOSE: To describe the spectrum of hospitalized NeuroCOVID on admission in a
tertiary neurology centre in Kolkata, the largest and most populated metropolitan
city in Eastern India.
METHOD: We retrospectively studied confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted with a
neurological condition from 1st May 2020 to 30th January 2021. Neurological
diagnoses and their temporal relationship to respiratory features along with
clinicodemographic profile for such patients was ascertained.
RESULT: 228 patients were diagnosed with NeuroCOVID at our centre. Of the 162
included population (median age was 59 (50-70) and 62.3% (101) were male) and
73.5% were diagnosed with NeuroCovid before any respiratory or febrile features. 
46 patients (28.8%) had a pre/co-existing neurological illness, and 103 (63.6%)
had systemic comorbidities. No significant difference was observed when comparing
demographics and comorbidities of NeuroCOVID patients presenting with and without
fever and respiratory features. Moreover, no individual NeuroCOVID diagnosis was 
more prone to present with respiratory or febrile features. Diabetes mellitus was
the only comorbidity which was significantly higher in the ischemic stroke group,
all other comorbidities and characteristics were evenly distributed between
stroke and non-stroke NeuroCOVID patients and encephalopathy non encephalopathy
NeuroCOVID patients.
CONCLUSION: Stroke and encephalopathy are the most prevalent parainfectious
neurological conditions occurring with COVID-19 in the Indian population. This
study demonstrates seemingly low-risk individuals (i.e. people without
pre-existing systemic and neurological comorbidities) may develop neurological
conditions. Moreover, NeuroCOVID may manifest independent of respiratory features
and fever.
