OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
novel coronavirus causing severe respiratory illness (COVID-19). This virus was
initially identified in Wuhan city, a populated area of the Hubei province in
China, and still remains one of the major global health challenges. RNA
interference (RNAi) is a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing that
plays a crucial role in innate viral defense mechanisms by inhibiting the virus
replication as well as expression of various viral proteins. Dicer, Drosha, Ago2,
and DGCR8 are essential components of the RNAi system, which is supposed to be
dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to assess the expression
level of the mentioned mRNAs in COVID-19patients compared to healthy individuals.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the expression of Dicer, Drosha, and Ago2
was statistically altered in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects.
Ultimately, the RNA interference mechanism as a crucial antiviral defense system 
was suggested to be dysregulated in COVID-19 patients.
