This study was aimed to explore the precise dose of corticosteroid therapy in
critical COVID-19. A total of forty-five critical COVID-19 patients were
enrolled. The process of critical COVID-19 was divided into alveolitis and
fibrosis stages. Most nonsurvivors died in fibrosis phase. Nonsurvivors had more 
dyspnea symptoms, fewer days of hospitalization, shorter duration of alveolitis
and fibrosis. High-dose daily corticosteroid therapy (≥150 mg/d) was associated
with shorter survival time and lower lymphocyte count in fibrosis phase.
Moreover, a high cumulative dose (≥604 mg) was tied to longer duration of virus
shedding, lower oxygenation index (OI), higher incidence of tracheal intubation, 
fewer lymphocytes and higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH). In alveolitis phase, the low-to-moderate-dose daily
corticosteroid therapy and a small cumulative dose reduced lymphocytes. In
conclusion, low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids may be beneficial in the
fibrosis phase. High-dose corticosteroid therapy in the fibrosis phase aggravates
the severity of critical COVID-19.
