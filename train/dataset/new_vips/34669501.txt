The COVID-19 pandemic has put severe pressure on health care systems worldwide.
Although attention has been focused on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, some
experts have warned about potentially devastating secondary health effects. These
effects may be most severe in low- and middle-income countries with already weak 
health care systems. This study examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on
early infant deaths, a question that is currently unsettled. We present new
evidence from Nigeria showing that early infant deaths have significantly
increased during the pandemic. Using data on the birth outcomes of a large and
diverse cohort of pregnant women enrolled in a prospective study and a
quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design, we found a
1.1-percentage-point (22 percent) increase and a 0.72-percentage-point
(23 percent) increase, respectively, in stillbirths and newborn deaths. Our
findings show that the health effects of the pandemic extend beyond counted
COVID-19 deaths. If these findings generalize to other low- and middle-income
countries, they may indicate that the hard-won gains in child survival made
during the past two decades are at risk of being reversed amid the ongoing
pandemic. Policies addressing disruptions to health services delivery and
providing support to vulnerable groups-specifically to households with pregnant
women-will be critical as the pandemic continues.
