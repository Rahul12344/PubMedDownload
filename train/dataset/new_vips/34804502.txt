Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020.
Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and
humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and
humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the
intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates 
the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and
Pearson's correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC)
in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March -
July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is
investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania
during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44%
respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC
was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity 
in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with
air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions
This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed 
during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.
