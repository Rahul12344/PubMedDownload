INTRODUCTION: Driven by the need to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
optimise use of health system resources, while maximising patient outcomes, the
COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unprecedented changes in cancer care. Some new or 
modified health care practices adopted during the pandemic will be of long term
value in improving the quality and resilience of cancer care in Australia and
internationally. The Cancer Australia consensus statement is intended to guide
and enhance the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic and in a
post-pandemic environment. This article summarises the full statement, which is
available at
https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/covid-19/covid-19-recovery-implications-cancer
-care.
MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: The statement is informed by a desktop literature review
and input from cancer experts and consumers at a virtual roundtable, held in July
2020, on key elements of cancer care that changed during the pandemic. It
describes targeted strategies (at system, service, practitioner and patient
levels) to retain, enhance and embed high value changes in practice. Principal
strategies include: implementing innovative models of care that are digitally
enabled and underpinned by clear governance, policies and procedures to guide
best practice cancer care; enabling health professionals to deliver
evidence-based best practice and coordinated, person-centred cancer care; and
empowering patients to improve health literacy and enhancing their ability to
engage in informed, shared decision making.
CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: Widespread adoption of high 
value health care practices across all levels of the cancer control sector will
be of considerable benefit to the delivery of optimal cancer care into the
future.
