As the world clamored to respond to the rapidly evolving coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, health care systems reacted swiftly to provide uninterrupted
care for patients. Within obstetrics and gynecology, nearly every facet of care
was influenced. Rescheduling of office visits, safety of labor and delivery and
in the operating room, and implementation of telemedicine are examples. Social
distancing has impacted academic centers in the education of trainees. COVID-19
vaccine trials have increased awareness of including pregnant and lactating
women. Last, the pandemic has reminded us of issues related to ethics, diversity 
and inclusiveness, marginalized communities, and the women's health workforce.
