BACKGROUND: Porcine vesicular disease is caused by the Seneca Valley virus (SVV),
it is a novel Picornaviridae, which is prevalent in several countries. However,
the pathogenicity of SVV on 5-6 week old pigs and the transmission routes of SVV 
remain unknown.
METHODS: This research mainly focuses on the pathogenicity of the CH-GX-01-2019
strain and the possible vector of SVV. In this study, 5-6 week old pigs infected 
with SVV (CH-GX-01-2019) and its clinical symptoms (including rectal temperatures
and other clinical symptoms) were monitored, qRT-PCR were used to detect the
viremia and virus distribution. Neutralization antibody assay was set up during
this research. Mosquitoes and Culicoides were collected from pigsties after pigs 
challenge with SVV, and SVV detection within mosquitoes and Culicoides was done
via RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The challenged pigs presented with low fevers and mild lethargy on
5-8 days post infection. The viremia lasted more than 14 days. SVV was detected
in almost all tissues on the 14th day following the challenge, and it was
significantly higher in the hoofs (vesicles) and lymph nodes in comparison with
other tissues. Neutralizing antibodies were also detected and could persist for
more than 28 days, in addition neutralizing antibody titers ranged from 1:128 to 
1:512. Mosquitoes and Culicoides were collected from the pigsty environments
following SVV infection. Although SVV was not detected in the mosquitoes, it was 
present in the Culicoides, however SVV could not be isolated from the positive
Culicoides.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work has enriched the knowledge relating to SVV pathogenicity
and possible transmission routes, which may lay the foundation for further
research into the prevention and control of this virus.
