BACKGROUND: We present a unique case of primary breast CD20-positive extranodal
NK/T cell lymphoma with stomach involvement in a young Chinese female patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with a mass in her right breast that
rapidly increased in size over approximately 2 months. Upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy showed a giant serpentine ulcer in the stomach. Biopsy was performed,
and microscopic inspection revealed that the fibrous tissue was diffusely
involved by medium to large abnormal lymphocytes. The cytoplasm was low to
moderate. The tumor cells had irregular nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. The
lymphoid cells were strongly immunoreactive to CD20, CD3, CD4, CD56, TIA-1, EBER,
and Ki-67 (90%). Epstein-Barr virus genomes were also found in tumor cells by in 
situ hybridization. A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan
revealed intense FDG uptake in the right breast and greater curvature of the
stomach. Monoclonal rearrangements of the T cell receptor (TCR-γ) and
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) were identified by genetic analysis.
Whole-genome next-generation sequencing was performed, and up to 12 gene
mutations, including a frameshift mutation in exon 4 of the BCOR (G97Rfs*87;
44.3%) gene and a base substitution mutation (Q61H 17.6%) in exon 3 of the KRAS
gene, were detected. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses
were performed using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated
discovery, which showed that rare primary breast CD20-positive extranodal NK/T
cell lymphoma had a unique genetic background compared with diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma without CD20 expression. The patient
received four cycles of the modified SMILE regimen. The second whole-body PET-CT 
scan revealed that the right breast mass was significantly smaller than before;
additionally, FDG uptake in the stomach wall disappeared.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic examination, extensive immunohistochemistry, and molecular 
profiling are essential for an accurate diagnosis. More similar cases are
required to clarify the biological pathways and even the potential molecular
mechanisms of rare lymphomas, which may help direct further treatment.
