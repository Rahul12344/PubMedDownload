Anti-viral small molecules are currently lacking for treating coronavirus
infection. The long development timescales for such drugs are a major problem,
but could be shortened by repurposing existing drugs. We therefore screened a
small library of FDA-approved compounds for potential severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antivirals using a pseudovirus system that
allows a sensitive read-out of infectivity. A group of structurally-related
compounds, showing moderate inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 2-5 Î¼M
range, were identified. Further studies demonstrated that these "kite-shaped"
molecules were surprisingly specific for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and that they 
acted early in the entry steps of the viral infectious cycle, but did not affect 
virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, the compounds were able to prevent
infection in both kidney- and lung-derived human cell lines. The structural
homology of the hits allowed the production of a well-defined pharmacophore that 
was found to be highly accurate in predicting the anti-viral activity of the
compounds in the screen. We discuss the prospects of repurposing these existing
drugs for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks.
