Despite many years from the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a
prophylactic vaccine against HIV is still needed. The failure of most of the
vaccine clinical trials in the field has different causes, mainly due by the
difficulties to identify the correct antigen able to prime the optimal B cell
lineage and then make the series of somatic mutations necessary to generate
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). B cells are responsible for the bNAbs
production; however, their function is strongly influenced by the presence of a
population of CD4+ T lymphocytes, mainly present in the lymphoid organs, the T
follicular helper cells (Tfh). In this review, the importance of the contribution
of Tfh cells in HIV response is highlighted and future therapy perspectives based
on these observations are described. The advanced technology available nowadays
and the wide knowledge built over the past years for HIV may eventually create
the best scenario for the generation of an effective vaccine.
