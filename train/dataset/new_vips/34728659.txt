A promising therapy for patients with B-cell lymphoma is based on vaccination
with idiotype monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since idiotypes are different in each
tumor, a personalized vaccine has to be produced for each patient. Expression of 
immunoglobulins with appropriate post-translational modifications for human use
often requires the use of stable mammalian cells that can be scaled-up to reach
the desired level of production. We have used a noncytopathic self-amplifying RNA
vector derived from Semliki Forest virus (ncSFV) to generate BHK cell lines
expressing murine follicular lymphoma-derived idiotype A20 mAb. ncSFV/BHK cell
lines expressed approximately 2 mg/L/24 h of A20 mAb with proper quaternary
structure and a glycosylation pattern similar to that of A20 mAb produced by
hybridoma cells. A20 mAb purified from the supernatant of a ncSFV cell line, or
from the hybridoma, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to
immunize Balb/c mice by administration of four weekly doses of 25 µg of mAb. Both
idiotype mAbs were able to induce a similar antitumor protection and longer
survival compared to non-immunized mice. These results indicate that the ncSFV
RNA vector could represent a quick and efficient system to produce
patient-specific idiotypes with potential application as lymphoma vaccines.
