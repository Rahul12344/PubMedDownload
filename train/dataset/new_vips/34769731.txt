In the first half of 2021, Israel had been ahead of other countries concerning
the speed of its rollout and coverage of COVID-19 vaccinations. During that time,
Israel had implemented a vaccine certificate policy, the "Green Pass Policy"
(GPP), to reduce virus spread and to allow the safe relaxation of COVID-19
restrictions in a time of great uncertainty. Based on an analysis of GPP
regulations and public statements compiled from the Israeli Ministry of Health
website, we describe the design and implementation of the GPP. We also look back 
and discuss lessons learned for countries that are considering a GPP policy,
given the current upsurge of the Delta variant as of summer 2021. To reduce
equity concerns when introducing a GPP, all population groups should be eligible 
for the vaccine (contingent on approval from the manufacturer) and have access to
it. Alternatively, health authorities can grant temporary certificates based on a
negative test. We also highlight the fact that in practice, there will be gaps
between the GPP regulations and implementation. While some places might require a
GPP without legal need, others will not implement it despite a legal obligation. 
The GPP regulations should have standardised epidemiological criteria, be
implemented gradually, remain flexible, and change according to the
epidemiological risks.
