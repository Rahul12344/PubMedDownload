Mass testing for the diagnostics of COVID-19 has been hampered in many countries 
owing to the high cost of the methodologies to detect genetic material of
SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we report on a low-cost immunosensor capable of
detecting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, including in samples of inactivated
virus. Detection is performed with electrical impedance spectroscopy using an
immunosensor that contains a monolayer film of carboxymethyl chitosan as matrix, 
coated with an active layer of antibodies specific to the spike protein. In
addition to a low limit of detection of 0.179 fg/mL within an almost linear
behavior from 10-20 g/mL to 10-14 g/mL, the immunosensor was highly selective.
For the samples with the spike protein could be distinguished in multidimensional
projection plots from samples with other biomarkers and analytes that could be
interfering species for healthy and infected patients. The excellent analytical
performance of the immunosensors was validated with the distinction between
control samples and those containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at different
concentrations. The mechanism behind the immunosensor performance is the specific
antibody-protein interaction, as confirmed with the changes induced in C-H
stretching and protein bands in polarization-modulated infrared reflection
absorption spectra (PM-IRRAS). Because impedance spectroscopy measurements can be
made with low-cost portable instruments, the immunosensor proposed here can be
applied in point-of-care diagnostics for mass testing even in places with limited
resources.
