Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Vaccine development approaches consist of viral vector vaccines, DNA 
vaccine, RNA vaccine, live attenuated virus, and recombinant proteins, which
elicit a specific immune response. The use of nanoparticles displaying antigen is
one of the alternative approaches to conventional vaccines. This is due to the
fact that nano-based vaccines are stable, able to target, form images, and offer 
an opportunity to enhance the immune responses. The diameters of ultrafine
nanoparticles are in the range of 1-100 nm. The application of nanotechnology on 
vaccine design provides precise fabrication of nanomaterials with desirable
properties and ability to eliminate undesirable features. To be successful,
nanomaterials must be uptaken into the cell, especially into the target and able 
to modulate cellular functions at the subcellular levels. The advantages of
nano-based vaccines are the ability to protect a cargo such as RNA, DNA, protein,
or synthesis substance and have enhanced stability in a broad range of pH,
ambient temperatures, and humidity for long-term storage. Moreover, nano-based
vaccines can be engineered to overcome biological barriers such as nonspecific
distribution in order to elicit functions in antigen presenting cells. In this
review, we will summarize on the developing COVID-19 vaccine strategies and how
the nanotechnology can enhance antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity
using advanced technology in nanocarrier to deliver antigens. The discussion
about their safe, effective, and affordable vaccines to immunize against COVID-19
will be highlighted.
