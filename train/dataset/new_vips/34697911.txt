BACKGROUND: Rates of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and diagnosis are variable
among people who use drugs (PWUD). In Puglia in 2018, of 871 subjects screened,
38% had HCV antibodies (HCVAb). Despite sustained virologic response at week 12
Sustained virologic response (SVR12) rates >95%, addiction centers in Italy are
not allowed to prescribe direct-acting antivirals (DAA).
AIM: To increase testing and linkage to care a dedicated program including "ad
hoc" transportation and fast-track access to care was offered to PWUD from
Puglia.
METHODS: Over 12 months, 1,470 individuals seen at 15 Services for Dependence
(SERDs) underwent screening. For HCVAb positive, a fast-track evaluation was
offered at our Hepatology Unit. Patients were subsequently taken to their
pharmacists to receive the prescribed DAA regimen. Treatment and adherence were
supervised by SERDs physicians, SVR12 assessed at our unit. The scalability of
the process was based on both, number of patients screened in our region in 2018,
and number of PWUD diagnosed and treated at our center during 2018-2019.
RESULTS: Of 1,470 individuals screened, 634 (43.1%) tested HCVAb positive.
Overall, 231 were RNA positive, 54% of whom on opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and
32% with cirrhosis. Median interval between RNA assessment and treatment start
was 22 days (0-300). Patients received 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen
without Ribavirin; in 220 patients who completed treatment, SVR12 was 98.6%.
Among GT3, SVR12 was 98%. No re-infection was observed. Improvements in
screening, and linkage to care were registered.
CONCLUSIONS: A PWUD-tailored service led to HCV care cascade improvement and high
SVR12 rates. Despite history of drug addiction, social instability and logistic
barriers, micro-elimination programs providing dedicated care are key drivers of 
success.
