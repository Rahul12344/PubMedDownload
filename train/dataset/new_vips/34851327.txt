The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
caused a major international public health concern. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11,
2020. In Panama, the first SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed on March 9, 2020,
and the first fatal case associated to COVID-19 was reported on March 10. This
report presents the case of a 44-year-old female who arrived at the hospital with
a respiratory failure, five days after the first fatal COVID-19 case, and who was
living in a region where hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases caused by Choclo
orthohantavirus (CHOV), are prevalent. Thus, the clinical personnel set a
differential diagnosis to determine a respiratory disease caused by the endemic
CHOV or the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2. This case investigation describes the first 
coinfection by SARS-CoV-2 and CHOV worldwide. PCR detected both viruses during
early stages of the disease and the genomic sequences were obtained. The presence
of antibodies was determined during the patient's hospitalization. After 23 days 
at the intensive care unit, the patient survived with no sequelae, and antibodies
against CHOV and SARS-CoV-2 were still detectable 12 months after the disease.
The detection of the coinfection in this patient highlights the importance,
during a pandemic, of complementing the testing and diagnosis of the emergent
agent, SARS-CoV-2, with other common endemic respiratory pathogens and other
zoonotic pathogens, like CHOV, in regions where they are of public health
concern.
