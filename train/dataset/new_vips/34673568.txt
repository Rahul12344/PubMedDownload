To delineate the in vivo role of different costimulatory signals in activating
and expanding highly functional virus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, we
designed synTacs, infusible biologics that recapitulate antigen-specific T cell
activation signals delivered by antigen-presenting cells. We constructed synTacs 
consisting of dimeric Fc-domain scaffolds linking CD28- or 4-1BB-specific ligands
to HLA-A2 MHC molecules covalently tethered to HIV- or CMV-derived peptides.
Treatment of HIV-infected donor PBMCs with synTacs bearing HIV- or CMV-derived
peptides induced vigorous and selective ex vivo expansion of highly functional
HIV- and/or CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively, with potent antiviral
activities. Intravenous injection of HIV- or CMV-specific synTacs into
immunodeficient mice intrasplenically engrafted with donor PBMCs markedly and
selectively expanded HIV-specific (32-fold) or CMV-specific (46-fold) human CD8+ 
T cells populating their spleens. Notably, these expanded HIV- or CMV-specific
CD8+ T cells directed potent in vivo suppression of HIV or CMV infections in the 
humanized mice, providing strong rationale for consideration of synTac-based
approaches as a therapeutic strategy to cure HIV and treat CMV and other viral
infections. The synTac platform flexibility supports facile delineation of in
vivo effects of different costimulatory signals on patient-derived virus-specific
CD8+ T cells, enabling optimization of individualized therapies, including HIV
cure strategies.
