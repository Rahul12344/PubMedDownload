Human-to-animal spillover of SARS-CoV-2 virus has occurred in a wide range of
animals, but thus far, the establishment of a new natural animal reservoir has
not been detected. Here, we detected SARS-CoV-2 virus using rRT-PCR in 129 out of
360 (35.8%) free-ranging white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) from
northeast Ohio (USA) sampled between January-March 2021. Deer in 6 locations were
infected with at least 3 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.2, B.1.596, B.1.582). The
B.1.2 viruses, dominant in Ohio at the time, spilled over multiple times into
deer populations in different locations. Deer-to-deer transmission may have
occurred in three locations. The establishment of a natural reservoir of
SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer could facilitate divergent evolutionary
trajectories and future spillback to humans, further complicating long-term
COVID-19 control strategies.One-Sentence Summary: A significant proportion of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in free-ranging US white-tailed deer reveals a potential new
reservoir.
