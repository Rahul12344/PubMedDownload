OBJECTIVE: Pre-existing health anxiety is associated with an intensified
affective response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the general population.
Still, results on the reaction of people with a diagnosis of pathological health 
anxiety (i.e., hypochondriasis) are scarce.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the course of (health) anxiety
related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in comparison to (health) anxiety related to other
severe diseases (e.g., cancer) in a sample of 12 patients with the diagnosis of
pathological health anxiety during the "first wave" of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Germany. Both SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety and anxiety related to other severe
diseases were assessed weekly over 16 measurement points (30.03.-19.07.2020) and 
primarily analyzed with fixed effects regression analyses.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety was on average significantly
lower than anxiety related to other severe diseases (d = -0.54, p < .001) and not
significantly associated with anxiety related to other severe diseases or
pre-COVID-19 health anxiety.
CONCLUSION: It therefore appears premature to assume that SARS-CoV-2 related
anxiety and other health worries are necessarily strongly interrelated and
comparably high in people with pathological health anxiety.
