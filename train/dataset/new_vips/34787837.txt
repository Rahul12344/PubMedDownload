INTRODUCTION: Several arboviruses causing human disease have been reported in
Brazil. In nature, arboviruses maintain a lifecycle involving vertebrates and
vectors, which may contribute for periodical reemergence of those of public
health concern in tropical regions, as Mato Grosso State (MT). In this study, we 
searched for arboviruses in mosquito body pools sampled during the rainy season
of 2018 in 21 bird watching points of Cuiabá and Varzea Grande, South Central MT.
METHODS: In total, 2873 (57%) males and 2167 (43%) females belonging to six urban
and sylvatic mosquito genera allocated to 398 pools were subjected to RNA
extraction and RT-PCR for arboviruses. Positive pools were subjected to virus
isolation in C6/36 cells.
RESULTS: A total of 102/398 pools, 66/233 (29.6%) of females, and 36/165 (21.8%) 
of males, mostly sampled in May (31/102), were positive for arboviruses.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was distributed in 19 points, Zika virus (ZIKV) was
found in 14 points, Mayaro virus (MAYV) in 10 points, and East Equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV) in three points. Culex quinquefasciatus pools (39/89 of
females and 24/99 of males) were positive for CHIKV, ZIKV, and MAYV; Aedes (Stg) 
aegypti pools (11/46 of females and 12/33 of males) for CHIKV, ZIKV, MAYV, and
EEEV; Aedes albopictus female pools (8/29) for CHIKV, ZIKV, and EEEV; and
Psorophora albigenu (2/12) and Psorophora ferox female pools (4/16) for CHIKV.
CONCLUSIONS: Arbovirus molecular detection in mosquito populations varies
considerable between geographical regions and epidemics, influenced by genetic
characteristics and microbiome interference on virus replication. Although
infected females are responsible for the transmission to vertebrates during
bloodfeeding, male infection by CHIKV, ZIKV, and MAYV resultant from vertical
route could lead to interepidemic maintenance of these arboviruses in their
natural reservoirs.
