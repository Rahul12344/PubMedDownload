Cancer victims, particularly those with lung cancer, are more susceptible and at 
higher danger of COVID-19 and associated consequences as a result of their
compromised immune systems, which makes them particularly sensitive. Because of a
variety of circumstances, cancer patients' diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare
are very complicated and time-consuming during an epidemic. In such
circumstances, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
algorithms (ML) offer the capacity to boost cancer sufferer diagnosis, therapy,
and care via the use of cutting technologies. For example, using clinical and
imaging data combined with machine learning methods, the researchers may be able 
to distinguish among lung alterations induced by corona virus and those produced 
by immunotherapy and radiation. During this epidemic, artificial intelligence
(AI) may be utilized to guarantee that the appropriate individuals are recruited 
in cancer clinical trials more quickly and effectively than in the past, which
was done in a conventional and complicated manner. In order to better care for
cancer patients and find novel and more effective therapies, It is critical that 
we move beyond traditional research methods and use artificial intelligence (AI) 
and machine learning to update our research (ML). Artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) are being utilised to help with several aspects of the 
COVID-19 epidemic, such as epidemiology, molecular research and medication
development, medical diagnosis and treatment, and socioeconomics. The use of
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and
treatment of COVID-19 patients is also being investigated. The combination of
artificial intelligence and machine learning in COVID-19 may help to identify
positive patients more quickly. In order to understand the dynamics of an
epidemic that is relevant to artificial intelligence, when used in different
patient groups, AI-based algorithms can quickly detect CT scans with COVID-19
linked pneumonia, as well as discriminate non-COVID connected pneumonia with high
specificity and accuracy. It is possible to utilize the existing difficulties and
future views presented in this study to guide an optimal implementation of AI and
machine learning technologies in an epidemic.
