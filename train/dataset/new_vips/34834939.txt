The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, threatens the entire
world. It has affected every aspect of life and increased the burden on both
healthcare and socioeconomic systems. Current studies have revealed that
excessive inflammatory immune responses are responsible for the severity of
COVID-19, which suggests that anti-inflammatory drugs may be promising
therapeutic treatments. However, there are currently a limited number of approved
therapeutics for COVID-19. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize microbial 
components derived from invading pathogens, are involved in both the initiation
of innate responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the hyperinflammatory
phenotype of COVID-19. In this review, we provide current knowledge on the
pivotal role of TLRs in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection and
demonstrate the potential effectiveness of TLR-targeting drugs on the control of 
hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19.
