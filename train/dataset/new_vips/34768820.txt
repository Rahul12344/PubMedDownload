Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe condition characterized 
by the systemic formation of microthrombi complicated with bleeding tendency and 
organ dysfunction. In the last years, it represents one of the most frequent
consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of DIC is
complex, with cross-talk between the coagulant and inflammatory pathways. The
objective of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory action of
ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA) in a lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced DIC model in rats. Experimental DIC was induced by continual
infusion of LPS (30 mg/kg) for 4 h through the tail vein. Um-PEA (30 mg/kg) was
given orally 30 min before and 1 h after the start of intravenous infusion of
LPS. Results showed that um-PEA reduced alteration of coagulation markers, as
well as proinflammatory cytokine release in plasma and lung samples, induced by
LPS infusion. Furthermore, um-PEA also has the effect of preventing the formation
of fibrin deposition and lung damage. Moreover, um-PEA was able to reduce the
number of mast cells (MCs) and the release of its serine proteases, which are
also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that um-PEA could 
be considered as a potential therapeutic approach in the management of DIC and in
clinical implications associated to coagulopathy and lung dysfunction, such as
COVID-19.
