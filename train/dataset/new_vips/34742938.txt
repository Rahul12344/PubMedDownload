INTRODUCTION =: Bacteriuria during pregnancy is a frequent and important cause of
morbidity and complications. Data on its occurrence in pregnant adolescents are
still scarce. METHODS =: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary
teaching hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. All adolescents (≤ 18 years) who came for
prenatal care between January 2010 and January 2016 were included.
Sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, obstetric history, and the
results of laboratory tests were selected. A urine sample was aseptically
collected from each patient to undergo microscopic and culture analysis. RESULTS 
=: A total of 388 pregnant adolescents averaging 15.30 ± 1.24 years of age were
included. The frequency of bacteriuria in this group was 17.01% (66/388). The
lack of sports practice (OR=8.65, 95% CI=1.09-68.39), the fact that pregnancy was
desired (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.08-4.34), and the use of hormonal methods of
contraception (OR=2.46, 95% CI=1.04-5.84) turned out to be independent risk
factors for bacteriuria. Protective factors were identified as late coitarche
(OR = 0.75, 95% CI=0.57-0.98) and a urine culture analysis at a later gestational
age (OR = 0.94, 95% CI=0.90-0.98). The most often isolated pathogens were
Escherichia coli (49%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (18%). CONCLUSION =:
Bacteriuria among pregnant adolescents is a relatively common condition. The
infection risk of the urinary tract was increased by physical inactivity and
seemingly by the influence of behavioral and sexual factors. Such results can
help to identify patients at risk, favoring the early diagnosis of the urinary
tract infections and optimizing prenatal care.
