BACKGROUND: Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 data remain limited and seropositivity rates in 
children were reported as <1% early in the pandemic. Seroepidemiologic evaluation
of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the US was performed.
METHODS: Children and adolescents â‰¤19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional,
observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in
Northern Virginia, US. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was
collected, and blood analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk
factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal
antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to
different antigens.
RESULTS: In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was
8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included
Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms,
exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 
multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of
seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Secondary analysis included
orthogonal antibody testing with assays for 1) a receptor binding domain specific
antigen and 2) a nucleocapsid specific antigen had concordance rates of 80.5% and
79.3% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by
seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also
higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior
reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19
infection. The role of children's disease transmission must be considered in
COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination.
