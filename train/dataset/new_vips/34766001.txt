Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). COVID-19 can spread
to the entire body and cause multiple organ failure. It is a daunting challenge
to control the fast growing worldwide pandemic because effective prevention and
treatment strategies are unavailable currently. Generally, the immune response of
the human body triggered by viral infection is essential for the elimination of
the virus. However, severe COVID-19 patients may manifest dysregulated immune
responses, such as lymphopenia, lymphocyte exhaustion, exacerbated antibody
response, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), etc. Understanding of these
immunological characteristics may help identify better approaches for diagnosis, 
prognosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. As specific anti-viral agents are
notoriously difficult to develop, strategies for modulating the immune responses 
by either developing novel vaccines or using immunotherapy hold great promise to 
improve the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
