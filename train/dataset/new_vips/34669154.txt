Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests cannot always detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 
possibly due to differences in sensitivity between sample types. Under these
circumstances, immunochromatography may serve as an alternative method to detect 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that indicate a history of infection. In our
analysis of patients with severe COVID-19 infection, we found that 14 of 19 serum
samples were positive for IgG antibodies, whereas 6 of 10 samples from patients
with asymptomatic or mild cases were negative. Two patients with immune
thrombocytopenia who were treated with prednisolone experienced aggressive
COVID-19-related respiratory failure and eventually died. Patients not in
remission and those who received steroid-based chemotherapy had a higher risk of 
death, and patients with lymphoid malignancies including lymphoma and myeloma
died in larger numbers than those with myeloid malignancies. A stricter cohorting
strategy based on repeat PCR tests or isolation to a private room should be
adopted in routine care in hematology departments to prevent viral spread to the 
environment.
