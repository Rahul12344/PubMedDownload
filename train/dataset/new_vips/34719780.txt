INTRODUCTION: Evidence about the consequences of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy is rapidly increasing;
however, data on antibody response and risk of transmission during pregnancy and 
delivery are still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2
is detectable in vaginal swabs and whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are
present in maternal and umbilical cord blood of pregnant women with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-unit prospective cohort study in Denmark including
pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a pharyngeal swab between
August 20, 2020, and March 1, 2021, who gave birth during the same period. All
patients admitted to the maternity ward and antepartum clinic were screened for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. A maternal blood sample and vaginal swabs were collected at
inclusion. If included antepartum, these samples were repeated intrapartum when
an umbilical cord blood sample was also collected. Swabs were analyzed for
SARS-CoV-2 and blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies.
Placental and neonatal swabs as well as placental histopathological examinations 
were performed on clinical indications.
RESULTS: We included 28 women, of whom four had serious maternal or fetal
outcomes including one case of neonatal death. Within the first 8 days after
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in two vaginal swabs
(2/28) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 1 of 13 women. From 16 days
after confirmed infection, antibodies were observed in 19 of 21 of women.
Antibodies in cord blood were not detected during the first 16 days after
confirmed infection (n = 7). However, from 26 days, antibodies were present in 16
of 17 cord blood samples of seropositive mothers. Placental examination in two
cases of severe fetal outcomes preceded by reduced fetal movements revealed
SARS-CoV-2 in swabs and severe histopathological abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 2 of 28 vaginal swabs within 8 days 
after confirmed infection in pregnant women. Our data suggest that maternal
seroconversion occurs between days 8 and 16, whereas antibodies in cord blood of 
seropositive mothers were present in the majority from 26 days after confirmed
infection. Additional data are needed regarding timing of seroconversion for the 
mother and appearance of antibodies in cord blood.
