This protocol details a rapid and reliable method for the production and
titration of high-titre viral pseudotype particles with the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (and D614G or other variants of concern, VOC) on a lentiviral vector
core, and use for neutralisation assays in target cells expressing
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2
(TMPRSS2). It additionally provides detailed instructions on substituting in new 
spike variants via gene cloning, lyophilisation and storage/shipping
considerations for wide deployment potential. Results obtained with this protocol
show that SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes can be produced at equivalent titres to SARS-CoV
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pseudotypes,
neutralised by human convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies, and stored at
a range of laboratory temperatures and lyophilised for distribution and
subsequent application.
