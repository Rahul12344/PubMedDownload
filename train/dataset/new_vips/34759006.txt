Replication of the RNA genome of flaviviruses without a primer involves
RNA-protein interactions that have been shown to include the recognition of the
stem-loop A (SLA) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) by the non-structural
protein 5 (NS5). We show that DENV2 NS5 arginine 888, located within the
C-terminal 18 residues, is completely conserved in all flaviviruses and interacts
specifically with the top-loop of 3'SL in the 3'UTR which contains the
pentanucleotide 5'-CACAG-3' previously shown to be critical for flavivirus RNA
replication. We present virological and biochemical data showing the importance
of this Arg 888 in virus viability and de novo initiation of RNA polymerase
activity in vitro. Based on our binding studies, we hypothesize that ternary
complex formation of NS5 with 3'SL, followed by dimerization, leads to the
formation of the de novo initiation complex that could be regulated by the
reversible zipping and unzipping of cis-acting RNA elements.
