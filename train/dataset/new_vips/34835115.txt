Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification regulating critical cellular 
processes such as protein degradation, trafficking and signaling pathways,
including activation of the innate immune response. Therefore, viruses, and
particularly influenza A virus (IAV), have evolved different mechanisms to
counteract this system to perform proper infection. Among IAV proteins, the
non-structural protein NS1 is shown to be one of the main virulence factors
involved in these viral hijackings. NS1 is notably able to inhibit the host's
antiviral response through the perturbation of ubiquitination in different ways, 
as discussed in this review.
