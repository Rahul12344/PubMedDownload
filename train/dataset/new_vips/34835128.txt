Metagenomics is greatly improving our ability to discover new viruses, as well as
their possible associations with disease. However, metagenomics has also changed 
our understanding of viruses in general. The vast expansion of currently known
viral diversity has revealed a large fraction of non-pathogenic viruses, and
offers a new perspective in which viruses function as important components of
many ecosystems. In this vein, studies of the human blood virome are often
motivated by the search for new viral diseases, especially those associated with 
blood transfusions. However, these studies have revealed the common presence of
apparently non-pathogenic viruses in blood, particularly human anelloviruses and,
to a lower extent, human pegiviruses (HPgV). To shed light on the diversity of
the human blood virome, we subjected pooled plasma samples from 587 healthy
donors in Spain to a viral enrichment protocol, followed by massive parallel
sequencing. This showed that anelloviruses were clearly the major component of
the blood virome and showed remarkable diversity. In total, we assembled 332
complete or near-complete anellovirus genomes, 50 of which could be considered
new species. HPgV was much less frequent, but we, nevertheless, recovered 17
different isolates that we subsequently used for characterizing the diversity of 
this virus. In-depth investigation of the human blood virome should help to
elucidate the ecology of these viruses, and to unveil potentially associated
diseases.
