The analysis of dengue virus (DENV) infected tissues in mice experimental model
and in human biopsies/autopsies may support the pathogenesis studies. Through
such models, it is possible to investigate possible histopathological changes
caused by the infection and detections of different targets of interest, such as 
viral antigens, immune cells, and cytokines. In this chapter, we showed a brief
review of how histological and immunohistochemistry approaches may improve the
knowledge in this field.
