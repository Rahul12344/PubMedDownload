Oral infection by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has recently gained great attention 
because of its involvement in the development of a subset of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma. The role of specific Alpha-HPVs in this regard has been 
well established, whereas the contribution of other genera is under
investigation. Despite their traditional classification as "cutaneous" types,
Beta and Gamma HPVs are frequently detected in oral samples. Due to the lack of a
standardized protocol, a large variety of methodologies have been used for oral
sample collection, DNA extraction, HPV detection and genotyping. Laboratory
procedures influence the evaluation of oral HPV prevalence, which largely varies 
also according to the population characteristics, e.g., age, gender, sexual
behavior, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status. Nevertheless, oral infection
by Beta and Gamma HPVs seems to be even more common than Alpha-HPVs. The latter
is 5-7% in the general population, and increases up to 30% approximately in
HIV-infected men who have sex with men. Despite major advances in the evaluation 
of oral HPV prevalence, its natural history is still little understood,
especially for Beta and Gamma HPVs. The latest technologies, such as Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS), can be exploited to gain new insights into oral HPV,
and to improve the identification of novel HPV types.
