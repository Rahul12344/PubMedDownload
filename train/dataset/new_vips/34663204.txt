BACKGROUND: The 10th and 9th revisions of the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10 and ICD9) have been
adopted worldwide as a well-recognized norm to share codes for diseases, signs
and symptoms, abnormal findings, etc. The international Consortium for Clinical
Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) website stores diagnosis COVID-19
disease data using ICD10 and ICD9 codes. However, the ICD systems are difficult
to decode due to their many shortcomings, which can be addressed using ontology.
METHODS: An ICD ontology (ICDO) was developed to logically and scientifically
represent ICD terms and their relations among different ICD terms. ICDO is also
aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and reuses terms from existing
ontologies. As a use case, the ICD10 and ICD9 diagnosis data from the 4CE website
were extracted, mapped to ICDO, and analyzed using ICDO.
RESULTS: We have developed the ICDO to ontologize the ICD terms and relations.
Different from existing disease ontologies, all ICD diseases in ICDO are defined 
as disease processes to describe their occurrence with other properties. The ICDO
decomposes each disease term into different components, including anatomic
entities, process profiles, etiological causes, output phenotype, etc. Over 900
ICD terms have been represented in ICDO. Many ICDO terms are presented in both
English and Chinese. The ICD10/ICD9-based diagnosis data of over 27,000 COVID-19 
patients from 5 countries were extracted from the 4CE. A total of 917
COVID-19-related disease codes, each of which were associated with 1 or more
cases in the 4CE dataset, were mapped to ICDO and further analyzed using the ICDO
logical annotations. Our study showed that COVID-19 targeted multiple systems and
organs such as the lung, heart, and kidney. Different acute and chronic kidney
phenotypes were identified. Some kidney diseases appeared to result from other
diseases, such as diabetes. Some of the findings could only be easily found using
ICDO instead of ICD9/10.
CONCLUSIONS: ICDO was developed to ontologize ICD10/10 codes and applied to study
COVID-19 patient diagnosis data. Our findings showed that ICDO provides a
semantic platform for more accurate detection of disease profiles.
