BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the BioNTech-Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination in the
elderly (≥80 years) could not be fully assessed in the BioNTech-Pfizer trial due 
to low numbers in this age group. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe
outcomes in octo- and novo-generians in a German state setting.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective observational study of 708,187 persons aged
≥80 years living in Bavaria, Germany, was conducted between Jan 9 to Apr 11,
2021. We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) for two doses of the BNT162b2
vaccine with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalisations and
mortality. Additionally, differences in VE by age groups ≥80 to ≤89 years and ≥90
years were studied. Analyses were adjusted by sex. By the end of follow-up, 63.8%
of the Bavarian population ≥80 years had received one dose, and 52.7% two doses, 
of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine lowered the proportion
of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related outcomes, resulting in VE estimates of 68.3%
(95% confidence interval (CI) 65.5%, 70.9%) for infection, 73.2% (95% CI 65.3%,
79.3%) for hospitalisation, and 85.1% (95% CI 80.0%, 89.0%) for mortality. Sex
differences in the risk of COVID-19 outcomes observed among unvaccinated persons 
disappeared after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses. Overall, the BNT162b2 vaccine was
equally effective in octo- and novo-genarians.
CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BioNTech-Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine is highly effective 
against COVID-19 outcomes in elderly persons.
