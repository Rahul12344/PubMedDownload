BACKGROUND: Pneumonia has a high incidence rate and is a major cause of mortality
in children, mostly community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Human bocavirus (HBoV),
since it first identified in 2005, has been repeatedly associated with
respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, the role and related information of
HBoV as a pathogen of CAP has not been fulfilled. Here our study is to assess the
epidemiological and clinical features in HBoV-positive children with CAP.
METHODS: A total of 878 secretions of lower respiratory samples were obtained,
multiplex PCR was used to detect HBoV and other respiratory viruses.
RESULTS: Of all cases, HBoV was detected in 10.0%, with a peak incidence of
infection among children < 2 year old, and predominantly noted in autumn and
winter. Only 8 patients were HBoV single infection. Co-infection with other
respiratory viruses was observed in 86.4%. Moreover, co-infection with bacteria
occurred in 27.3% and with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) in 33.0% of HBoV-positive
patients. Among all HBoV-positive samples co-infected with bacteria, 87.5% are
gram negative bacteria. Compared with HBoV-negative group, age (P = 0.048),
wheezing (P = 0.015), tachypnea (P = 0.016), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.026)
and severe pneumonia (P = 0.023) were statistically significant in HBoV-positive 
patients. Furthermore, HBoV-positive patients less than 1 year old were more
likely to have co-infection with bacteria (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: HBoV can be detected alone in respiratory samples of children with
CAP, maybe it is one of the causes of CAP in infants. The high incidence of
severe pneumonia was found in HBoV-positive patients compared with HBoV-negative 
cases may indicate a relationship between severe pneumonia and HBoV.
