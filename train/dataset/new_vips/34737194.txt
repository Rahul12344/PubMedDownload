BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal
oxygen (HFNO) are considered 'aerosol-generating procedures' in the treatment of 
COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: To measure air and surface environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2
virus when CPAP and HFNO are used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to
investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and
patients.
METHODS: 30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen,
with a fraction of inspired oxygen ≥0.4 to maintain oxygen saturation ≥94%, were 
prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study.
Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each
group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected
from each participant and the clinical environment. Real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and
positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of
biologically viable virus.
RESULTS: Overall 21/30 (70%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface
samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively,
although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and
surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a). CPAP/HFNO use or coughing was not
associated with significantly more environmental contamination than supplemental 
oxygen use. Only one nasopharyngeal sample was culture positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPAP and HFNO to treat moderate/severe COVID-19 did not
appear to be associated with substantially higher levels of air or surface viral 
contamination in the immediate care environment, compared with the use of
supplemental oxygen.
