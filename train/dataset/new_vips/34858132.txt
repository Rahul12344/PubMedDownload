Intrauterine viral infections during pregnancy by pathogens such as Zika virus,
Cytomegalovirus, Rubella and Herpes Simplex virus can lead to prenatal as well as
postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders. Although maternal viral infections are
common during pregnancy, viruses rarely penetrate the trophoblast. When they do
cross, viruses can cause adverse congenital health conditions for the fetus. In
this context, maternal inflammatory responses to these neurotropic pathogens play
a significant role in negatively affecting neurodevelopment. For instance,
intrauterine inflammation poses an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders
such as microcephaly, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy and
epilepsy. Severe inflammatory responses have been linked to stillbirths, preterm 
births, abortions and microcephaly. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic
basis of how immune system shapes the landscape of the brain and how different
neurotropic viral pathogens evoke inflammatory responses. Finally, we list the
consequences of neuroinflammation on fetal brain development and discuss
directions for future research and intervention strategies.
