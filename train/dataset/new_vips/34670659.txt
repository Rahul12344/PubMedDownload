The United States is currently affected by widespread hepatitis A virus (HAV)
outbreaks. We investigated HAV incidence rates among source plasma donors in the 
United States since 2016. Serial donations from HAV-positive frequent donors were
analyzed for common biologic markers to obtain a detailed picture of the course
of infection. We found a considerable increase in incidence rates with shifting
outbreak hotspots over time. Although individual biomarker profiles were highly
variable, HAV RNA typically had a high peak and a biphasic decrease and often
remained detectable for several months. One donor had a biomarker pattern
indicative of previous exposure. Our findings show that current HAV outbreaks
have been spilling over into the plasma donor population. The detailed results
presented improve our comprehension of HAV infection and related public health
aspects. In addition, the capture of full RNA curves enables estimation of HAV
doubling time.
