AIDS restriction genes (ARGs) like APOBEC3, TRIM5α, and BST2 can act as
immunological detectors of the innate protective mechanism of the body. ARGs
influence the course of viral pathogenesis and progression of the disease. The
infection caused by different viruses including HIV activates the innate immune
receptors leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines, interferons and
signals that recruit and activate cells involved in the process of inflammation
following induction of adaptive immunity. Differential expression of genes
involved in viral infection decide the fate and subsequent susceptibility to
infection and its clinical outcome. Nevertheless, comprehensive reports on the
incidence of genetic polymorphism of APOBEC3s, TRIM5α, and BST-2 in the general
population and its association with pathological conditions have not been
described well. Therefore, the occurrence of APOBEC3, TRIM5α, and BST2
polymorphism in healthy individuals and its impact on HIV transmission was
analyzed. We conducted an extensive search using the several databases including,
EMBASE, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar. APOBEC3-D, -F, -G, and -H out of
the seven human APOBEC3s, help in the control of viral infection. Amongst various
restriction factors, TRIM5α and BST-2 also restrict the viral infection followed 
by the development of the disease. In the current review, a brief account of the 
polymorphism in the APOBEC3G, TRIM5α, and BST2 genes are explored among different
populations along with the interaction of APOBEC3G with Vif protein. Furthermore,
this review specifically focus on ARGs polymorphism (APOBEC3G, TRIM5α, and BST2) 
associated with HIV transmission.
