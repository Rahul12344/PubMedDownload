BACKGROUND: In 2017, Tayside, a region in the East of Scotland, rapidly scaled-up
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) outreach and treatment among People Who Inject Drugs
(PWID) using novel community care pathways.
AIMS: We aimed to determine treatment outcomes for PWID during the scale-up
against pre-determined targets; and assess re-infection, mortality, and
post-treatment follow up.
METHODS: HCV treatment was delivered in community pharmacies, drug treatment
centres, nurse-led outreach clinics, prisons, and needle exchanges, alongside
conventional hospital care. We retrospectively analysed clinical outcomes and
compared pathways using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Of 800 estimated HCV-infected PWID, 718 (90%) were diagnosed. 713
treatments commenced among 662 (92%) PWID, delivering 577 (81%) Sustained
Virologic Responses (SVR). SVR was 91% among those who attended for testing.
Forty-six individuals were treated more than once. Needle exchanges and community
pharmacies initiated 49% of all treatments. Regression analyses implied
pharmacies had superior follow-up, but there was no difference in likelihood of
achieving SVR in community pathways relative to hospital care. Re-infection
occurred 39 times over 256.57 person years (PY), yielding a rate of 15.20 per 100
PY (95% CI 10.81-20.78). 54 deaths occurred (29 drug related) over 1,553.04 PY,
yielding a mortality rate of 3.48 per 100 PY (95% CI 2.61-4.54). Drug-related
mortality was 1.87 per 100 PY (95% CI 1.25-2.68).
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid HCV treatment scale-up to PWID in community settings, whilst
maintaining high SVR, is achievable. However, other interventions are required to
minimise re-infection; reduce drug-related deaths; and improve post-SVR follow-up
testing regionally.
