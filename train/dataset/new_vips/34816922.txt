OBJECTIVES: Patients being treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(anti-TNF-alpha) agents were reported to have better prognosis related to
COVID-19. We evaluated the factors affecting the frequency, clinical course, and 
outcome of COVID-19 in patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents.
METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid diseases and chronic inflammatory bowel
diseases treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents were evaluated retrospectively. The
laboratory data in routine visits, frequency of COVID-19, pneumonia,
hospitalization and/or intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up and, mortality were
recorded. The factors related to COVID-19 frequency and clinical outcome were
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 324 patients (177 males [54.6%] and 147 females [45.4%], mean
age: 45.3±12.16 years) was included in the study. In all, 44 (13.6%) patients had
COVID-19; of these, 11 (25%) developed pneumonia, 7 (15.9%) were hospitalized,
and 1 (2.3%) was followed up in ICU. There was no mortality. The patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia were older (mean age: 52±11 years versus 41±12 years, p=0.01),
had hypertension and coronary artery disease more frequently (5 cases [55.6%]
versus 4 cases [44.4], p=0.02 and 2 cases [100%] versus 0 cases [0%], p=0.014,
respectively), and lower eosinophil % (1.35±1.79% versus 2.3±1.45%, p=0.016). The
diabetes mellitus was more frequent (66.7 versus 33.3%, p=0.013), and mean
eosinophil % was lower among inpatients compared with outpatients (1.29±2.22%
versus 2.19±1.37%, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents
having COVID-19 might have mild clinical course and better prognosis.
