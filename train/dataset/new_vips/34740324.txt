BACKGROUND: Viral infections are prevalent in human cancers and they have great
diagnostic and theranostic values in clinical practice. Recently, their potential
of shaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has been related to the
immunotherapy of human cancers. However, the landscape of viral expressions and
immune status in human cancers remains incompletely understood.
METHODS: We developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based pipeline to detect
viral sequences from the whole transcriptome and used machine learning algorithms
to classify different TIME subtypes.
RESULTS: We revealed a pan-cancer landscape of viral expressions in human cancers
where 9 types of viruses were detected in 744 tumors of 25 cancer types. Viral
infections showed different tissue tendencies and expression levels. Multi-omics 
analyses further revealed their distinct impacts on genomic, transcriptomic and
immune responses. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD)
and Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-infected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSC) showed decreased genomic variations, significantly altered gene
expressions, and effectively triggered anti-viral immune responses. We identified
three TIME subtypes, in which the "Immune-Stimulation" subtype might be the
promising candidate for immunotherapy. EBV-infected STAD and HPV-infected HNSC
showed a higher frequency of the "Immune-Stimulation" subtype. Finally, we
constructed the eVIIS pipeline to simultaneously evaluate viral infection and
immune status in external datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections are prevalent in human cancers and have distinct
influences on hosts. EBV and HPV infections combined with the TIME subtype could 
be promising biomarkers of immunotherapy in STAD and HNSC, respectively. The
eVIIS pipeline could be a practical tool to facilitate clinical practice and
relevant studies.
