OBJECTIVE: We describe the design, implementation, and validation of an online,
publicly available tool to algorithmically triage patients experiencing severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-like symptoms.
METHODS: We conducted a chart review of patients who completed the triage tool
and subsequently contacted our institution's phone triage hotline to assess tool-
and clinician-assigned triage codes, patient demographics, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) 
test data, and health care utilization in the 30 days post-encounter. We
calculated the percentage of concordance between tool- and clinician-assigned
triage categories, down-triage (clinician assigning a less severe category than
the triage tool), and up-triage (clinician assigning a more severe category than 
the triage tool) instances.
RESULTS: From May 4, 2020 through January 31, 2021, the triage tool was completed
30,321 times by 20,930 unique patients. Of those 30,321 triage tool completions, 
51.7% were assessed by the triage tool to be asymptomatic, 15.6% low severity,
21.7% moderate severity, and 11.0% high severity. The concordance rate, where the
triage tool and clinician assigned the same clinical severity, was 29.2%. The
down-triage rate was 70.1%. Only six patients were up-triaged by the clinician.
72.1% received a COVID-19 test administered by our health care system within 14
days of their encounter, with a positivity rate of 14.7%.
CONCLUSION: The design, pilot, and validation analysis in this study show that
this COVID-19 triage tool can safely triage patients when compared with clinician
triage personnel. This work may signal opportunities for automated triage of
patients for conditions beyond COVID-19 to improve patient experience by enabling
self-service, on-demand, 24/7 triage access.
