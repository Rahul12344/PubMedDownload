Update in
    Emerg Microbes Infect. 2021 Nov 26;:1-34.

The repeated emergence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses as well as their 
evolving variants highlight the need to develop potent and broad-spectrum
antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. By screening monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
isolated from COVID-19-convalescent patients, we found one mAb, 2-36, with
cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV. We solved the cryo-EM structure of 
2-36 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV spike, revealing a highly conserved
epitope in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Antibody 2-36 neutralized not only 
all current circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-COV, but also a panel of bat
and pangolin sarbecoviruses that can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) as a receptor. We selected 2-36-escape viruses in vitro and confirmed that
K378T in SARS-CoV-2 RBD led to viral resistance. Taken together, 2-36 represents 
a strategic reserve drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of possible
diseases caused by pre-emergent SARS-related coronaviruses. Its epitope defines a
promising target for the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine.
