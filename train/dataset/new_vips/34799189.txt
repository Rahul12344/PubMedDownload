Hepatitis B virus is a small enveloped RNA virus, which replicates independently 
but requires the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to provide the envelope proteins
necessary for the assembly of its own viral particles. Approximately 5% of
chronic hepatitis B virus carriers are infected with HDV. HBV vaccination remains
the best preventive treatment for HDV. All HBV patients should be screened for
HDV (anti-HDV serology). In case of positive HDV serology, HDV replication (HDV
RNA) should be investigated using a sensitive and specific technique. Hepatitis
Delta is often complicated by cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For
this reason, every patient with Delta cirrhosis should be screened for HCC by
abdominal ultrasound every 6 months. The historical treatment was based on
PEG-IFN with many side effects. A new treatment has been approved, Bulevirtide
(Hepcludex®) an HDV/HBV entry inhibitor, for any patient with chronic hepatitis
Delta infection (CHD) with active replication (except in decompensated
cirrhosis), at a dose of 2mg/day by subcutaneous injection. The exact duration
on-treatment is unknown, thus treatment should be continued if clinical benefit
is observed.
