Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, telemedicine was an upcoming modality of
diagnosis and treatment, but was limited by inadequate guidelines and
legislation. Now, during the pandemic, policy makers worldwide have found it
prudent to set forth new telemedicine guidelines to ease and regulate operations.
The Government of India, along with the Board of Governors (in supercession of
the Medical Council of India), amended the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, and 
published the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines in 2020 to lay down a framework
for telemedicine practice in our country. This step will provide a medico-legal
context for the delivery of online health services. However, the Guidelines in
their present form only partly address the ethical aspects of telemedicine in
India. Here, we briefly describe these Guidelines and highlight the ethical
concerns surrounding the teleconsultation process in our country. We also suggest
possible solutions to these ethical issues surrounding the practice of
telemedicine.
