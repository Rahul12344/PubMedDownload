Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has become a promising tool to estimate
population-level changes in community infections and the prevalence of COVID-19
disease. Although many studies have reported the detection and quantification of 
SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, remarkable variation remains in the methodology. In
this study, we validated a molecular testing method by concentrating viruses from
wastewater using ultrafiltration and detecting SARS-CoV-2 using one-step RT-qPCR 
assay. The following parameters were optimized including sample storage
condition, wastewater pH, RNA extraction and RT-qPCR assay by quantification of
SARS-CoV-2 or spiked human coronavirus strain 229E (hCoV-229E). Wastewater
samples stored at 4 °C after collection showed significantly enhanced detection
of SARS-CoV-2 with approximately 2-3 PCR-cycle threshold (Ct) values less when
compared to samples stored at -20 °C. Pre-adjustment of the wastewater pH to 9.6 
to aid virus desorption followed by pH readjustment to neutral after solid
removal significantly increased the recovery of spiked hCoV-229E. Of the five
commercially available RNA isolation kits evaluated, the MagMAX-96 viral RNA
isolation kit showed the best recovery of hCoV-229E (50.1 ± 20.1%). Compared with
two-step RT-qPCR, one-step RT-qPCR improved sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Salmon DNA was included for monitoring PCR inhibition and pepper mild mottle
virus (PMMoV), a fecal indicator indigenous to wastewater, was used to normalize 
SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater. Our method for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2
in wastewater provides a useful tool for public health surveillance of COVID-19.
