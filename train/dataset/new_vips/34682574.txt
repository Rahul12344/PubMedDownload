Vulnerable populations may be more vulnerable to mental health problems posed by 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A systematic review was
performed to compare the mental health impact of COVID-19 between vulnerable and 
non-vulnerable groups. Five electronic databases were searched for observational 
studies reporting the psychological outcomes of both vulnerable populations and
healthy controls during the COVID-19 era. The primary outcomes are the severity
of depression and anxiety, and secondary outcomes include other aspects of mental
health such as stress or sleep disturbance. Meta-analysis was performed for the
severity of mental health symptoms, and the results were presented as
standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 25 studies 
were included. According to the findings, the elderly generally experienced
significantly lower levels of psychological symptoms including depression,
anxiety, and perceived stress. Pregnant women, patients with chronic diseases,
and patients with pre-existing severe mental disorders showed mixed results
according to each mental health outcome. The results indicate that vulnerable
groups have been affected differently in the COVID-19 era. Though the
insufficient number and heterogeneity of included studies leave the results
inconclusive, our findings may contribute to identifying priorities of mental
health needs among various vulnerable populations and allocating health resources
with efficiency.
