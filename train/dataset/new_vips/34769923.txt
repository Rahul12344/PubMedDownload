The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic altered environmental factors. We
studied the impact of these changes on asthma exacerbation (AE) by comparing the 
AE-related environmental factors between COVID-19 (2020) and pre-COVID-19
(2011-2019) eras. Between 2011 and 2020, 278,465 children (<16 years old) visited
our emergency department, and 7476 were diagnosed with AE. The number of patients
showed spring and fall peaks in 2011-2019. Multivariate analyses showed
significant positive relationships of the number of AE patients with the average 
temperature among all patients and 0-5-year-olds and with sulfur dioxide (SO2)
levels in 2011-2019 among 0-5-year-olds. Although the spring peak in the number
of patients was not observed in 2020 after declaration of a state of emergency,
the fall peak was again observed after the state of emergency was lifted. No
changes in average temperature were detected, but SO2 was significantly reduced
following declaration of the state of emergency in 2020. Therefore, SO2 reduction
might have contributed to the disappearance of the peak of AE. However, a fall
peak was observed again in 2020, although SO2 levels continued to be low. These
data suggest that person to person interaction seems to be associated with AE,
presumably due to unknown viral infections.
