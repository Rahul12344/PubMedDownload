Recombinant proteins have a broad range of applications from basic research to
pharmaceutical development. Of utmost importance in the production of recombinant
proteins is the selection of the best recombinant protein production system, such
that high-quality and functional recombinant proteins are produced. Plants can
produce a large quantity of recombinant proteins rapidly and economically.
Glycoengineering has created "humanized" plant lines that can produce
glycoproteins with specific human glycans with a high level of homogeneity on
demand. Here, a detailed protocol was provided to produce a large, multisubunit, 
and complex bispecific antibody that targets two distinct viruses. The successful
production of this multiple-subunit protein demonstrated that plants are the
optimal system for the production of recombinant proteins of various sizes and
complexity, which can be employed for various applications including diagnostics,
therapeutics, and vaccines to combat current and future pandemics.
