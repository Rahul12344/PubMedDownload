G-quadruplexes (G4s) are implicated in pathological processes such as cancer and 
infective diseases. Their targeting with G4-ligands has shown therapeutic
capacity. Most of the current G4-ligands are planar molecules, do not
discriminate among G4s, and have poor druglike properties. The available methods 
to identify compounds selective for one single G4 are often time-consuming. Here,
we describe the development, validation, and application of an affinity-selection
mass spectrometry method that employs unlabeled G4 oligonucleotides as targets
and allows testing of up to 320 unmodified small molecules in a single tube. As a
proof of concept, this method was applied to screen a library of 40â€¯000 druglike 
molecules against two G4s, transcriptional regulators of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. 
We identified nonplanar pyrazolopyrimidines that selectively recognize and
stabilize the major HIV-1 LTR G4 possibly by fitting and binding through
H-bonding in its unique binding pocket. The compounds inhibit LTR promoter
activity and HIV-1 replication. We propose this method to prompt the fast
development of new G4-based therapeutics.
