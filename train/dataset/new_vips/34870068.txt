Introduction: Persons with hemophilia and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have 
a lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than those never HCV infected.
However, it is unknown whether HRQoL after HCV eradication is comparable to
individuals never HCV infected. We aimed to compare HRQoL between HCV-cured and
never chronically HCV-infected persons with hemophilia.
Methods: All persons with hemophilia in the Netherlands were invited for a
nationwide study conducted in 2018-2019. For the current analysis, participants
born before 1992 with data on HRQoL and HCV status were included. HCV status was 
collected from medical records. HRQoL was measured by RAND-36 questionnaire, with
a minimally important difference set at 4.0 points. Multivariable linear
regression was used to adjust for age, hemophilia severity, HIV status, and
self-reported joint impairment.
Results: In total, 486 persons were eligible; 180 were HCV cured and 306 never
chronically HCV infected. Compared with those never HCV infected, HCV-cured
individuals were older (57 vs. 53 years), more often had severe hemophilia (67%
vs. 21%), and reported more impaired joints (median 3 vs. 0). Compared with those
never HCV infected, adjusted RAND-36 domain scores of HCV-cured individuals cured
were lower on all RAND-36 domains except Pain, ranging from a difference of 4.5
(95% CI, -8.8 to -0.3) for Physical functioning to 11.3 (95% CI, -19.4 to -3.1)
for Role limitations due to physical problems.
Conclusion: Despite effective HCV treatment, HRQoL of HCV-cured persons with
hemophilia is still lower than HRQoL of those never chronically HCV-infected on
all RAND-36 domains. This implies that careful psychosocial follow-up and support
are indicated.
