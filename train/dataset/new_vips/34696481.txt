This review summarizes research on virus diseases of cereals and oilseeds in
Australia since the 1950s. All viruses known to infect the diverse range of
cereal and oilseed crops grown in the continent's temperate, Mediterranean,
subtropical and tropical cropping regions are included. Viruses that occur
commonly and have potential to cause the greatest seed yield and quality losses
are described in detail, focusing on their biology, epidemiology and management. 
These are: barley yellow dwarf virus, cereal yellow dwarf virus and wheat streak 
mosaic virus in wheat, barley, oats, triticale and rye; Johnsongrass mosaic virus
in sorghum, maize, sweet corn and pearl millet; turnip yellows virus and turnip
mosaic virus in canola and Indian mustard; tobacco streak virus in sunflower; and
cotton bunchy top virus in cotton. The currently less important viruses covered
number nine infecting nine cereal crops and 14 infecting eight oilseed crops
(none recorded for rice or linseed). Brief background information on the scope of
the Australian cereal and oilseed industries, virus epidemiology and management
and yield loss quantification is provided. Major future threats to managing virus
diseases effectively include damaging viruses and virus vector species spreading 
from elsewhere, the increasing spectrum of insecticide resistance in insect and
mite vectors, resistance-breaking virus strains, changes in epidemiology, virus
and vectors impacts arising from climate instability and extreme weather events, 
and insufficient industry awareness of virus diseases. The pressing need for more
resources to focus on addressing these threats is emphasized and recommendations 
over future research priorities provided.
