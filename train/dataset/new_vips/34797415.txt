The COVID-19 pandemic has placed epidemiologists, modelers, and policy makers at 
the forefront of the global discussion of how to control the spread of
coronavirus. The main challenges confronting modelling approaches include
real-time projections of changes in the numbers of cases, hospitalizations, and
fatalities, the consequences of public health policy, the understanding of how
best to implement varied non-pharmaceutical interventions and potential
vaccination strategies, now that vaccines are available for distribution. Here,
we: (i) review carefully selected literature on COVID-19 modeling to identify
challenges associated with developing appropriate models along with collecting
the fine-tuned data, (ii) use the identified challenges to suggest prospective
modeling frameworks through which adaptive interventions such as vaccine
strategies and the uses of diagnostic tests can be evaluated, and (iii) provide a
novel Multiresolution Modeling Framework which constructs a multi-objective
optimization problem by considering relevant stakeholders' participatory
perspective to carry out epidemic nowcasting and future prediction. Consolidating
our understanding of model approaches to COVID-19 will assist policy makers in
designing interventions that are not only maximally effective but also
economically beneficial.
