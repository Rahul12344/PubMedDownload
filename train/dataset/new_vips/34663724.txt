Although it is held that proinflammatory changes precede the onset of breast
cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that
FRS2β, an adaptor protein expressed in a small subset of epithelial cells,
triggers the proinflammatory changes that induce stroma in premalignant mammary
tissues and is responsible for the disease onset. FRS2β deficiency in mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ErbB2 mice markedly attenuated tumorigenesis.
Importantly, tumor cells derived from MMTV-ErbB2 mice failed to generate tumors
when grafted in the FRS2β-deficient premalignant tissues. We found that
colocalization of FRS2β and the NEMO subunit of the IκB kinase complex in early
endosomes led to activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a master regulator of
inflammation. Moreover, inhibition of the activities of the NF-κB-induced
cytokines, CXC chemokine ligand 12 and insulin-like growth factor 1, abrogated
tumorigenesis. Human breast cancer tissues that express higher levels of FRS2β
contain more stroma. The elucidation of the FRS2β-NF-κB axis uncovers a molecular
link between the proinflammatory changes and the disease onset.
