Human epithelial organoids-3D spheroids derived from adult tissue stem
cells-enable investigation of epithelial physiology and disease and host
interactions with microorganisms, viruses and bioactive molecules. One challenge 
in using organoids is the difficulty in accessing the apical, or luminal, surface
of the epithelium, which is enclosed within the organoid interior. This protocol 
describes a method we previously developed to control human and mouse organoid
polarity in suspension culture such that the apical surface faces outward to the 
medium (apical-out organoids). Our protocol establishes apical-out polarity
rapidly (24-48 h), preserves epithelial integrity, maintains secretory and
absorptive functions and allows regulation of differentiation. Here, we provide a
detailed description of the organoid polarity reversal method, compatible
characterization assays and an example of an application of the
technology-specifically the impact of host-microbe interactions on epithelial
function. Control of organoid polarity expands the possibilities of organoid use 
in gastrointestinal and respiratory health and disease research.
