PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the face of
healthcare. The current review is to discuss the major aspects that have changed 
in pediatric otolaryngology, from surgical operations management, to clinic
workflow, to procedural precautions.
RECENT FINDINGS: There have been many studies over the past year describing
different ways to improve the safety of healthcare delivery in pediatric
otolaryngology amidst a global pandemic, as well as ways to improve clinic and
surgical logistics along with guidelines for telehealth of a surgical specialty.
SUMMARY: COVID-19 has forever altered how healthcare is viewed and practiced, and
pediatric otolaryngology was not exempt. With an increased focus on provider
safety, as well as novel ways of utilizing changes in methods of communication,
the practice of pediatric otolaryngology has evolved with the rest of healthcare 
to take on the new challenges brought on by this global pandemic.
