Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes a highly devastating disease of
sheep and goats that threatens food security, small ruminant production and
susceptible endangered wild ruminants. With policy directed towards achieving
global PPR eradication, the establishment of cost-effective genomic surveillance 
tools is critical where PPR is endemic. Genomic data can provide sufficient
in-depth information to identify the pockets of endemicity responsible for PPRV
persistence and viral evolution, and direct an appropriate vaccination response. 
Yet, access to the required sequencing technology is low in resource-limited
settings and is compounded by the difficulty of transporting clinical samples
from wildlife across international borders due to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora, and Nagoya Protocol 
regulations. Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing technology has recently
demonstrated an extraordinary performance in the sequencing of PPRV due to its
rapidity, utility in endemic countries and comparatively low cost per sample when
compared to other whole-genome (WGS) sequencing platforms. In the present study, 
Oxford nanopore MinION sequencing was utilised to generate complete genomes of
PPRV isolates collected from infected goats in Ngorongoro and Momba districts in 
the northern and southern highlands of Tanzania during 2016 and 2018,
respectively. The tiling multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried
out with twenty-five pairs of long-read primers. The resulting PCR amplicons were
used for nanopore library preparation and sequencing. The analysis of output data
was complete genomes of PPRV, produced within four hours of sequencing (accession
numbers: MW960272 and MZ322753). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes
revealed a high nucleotide identity, between 96.19 and 99.24% with lineage III
PPRV currently circulating in East Africa, indicating a common origin. The Oxford
nanopore MinION sequencer can be deployed to overcome diagnostic and surveillance
challenges in the PPR Global Control and Eradication program. However, the
coverage depth was uneven across the genome and amplicon dropout was observed
mainly in the GC-rich region between the matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of PPRV.
Thus, larger field studies are needed to allow the collection of sufficient data 
to assess the robustness of nanopore sequencing technology.
