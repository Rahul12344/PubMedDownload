BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) has had a
considerable impact on athletic competition and team sports training. Athletes
have been forced to train alone at home. However, the isolation training model
effects are still unknown.
PURPOSE: This study compared the effects of personal isolation training (PIT) and
detraining (DT) on specific sport performances (flexibility, power, reaction
time, acceleration, and aerobic capacity) and body composition in elite taekwondo
athletes.
METHODS: Eleven elite taekwondo athletes were recruited as voluntary subjects.
Athletes were randomly paired by weight into the personal isolation training
group (PIT group: N = 5, age: 21.2 ± 0.4 years, BMI: 22.2 ± 0.8 kg/m2) or
detraining group (DT group: N = 6, age: 19.8 ± 0.3 years, BMI: 23.1 ± 1.0 kg/m2).
All subjects performed the same training content prior to the pre-test (T1). When
the pre-test was completed, all subjects underwent 12 weeks of PIT or DT.
Athletes were then administrated the post-test (T2). The athlete's sport
performances and body composition were measured to compare the differences
between the two groups (PIT and DT) and two phases (T1 and T2).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in kicking reaction time and
flexibility in both groups (p > 0.05). The PIT showed significant improvements in
10 m (10M) sprint performance (p < 0.05), and displayed a progress trend in
Abalakov jump performance. In addition, the PIT resulted in a better change
response in 10M sprint performance (PIT: -4.2%, DT: +2.1%), aerobic endurance
performance (PIT: -10.2%, DT: -18.4%), right arm muscle mass (PIT: +2.9%, DT:
-3.8%), and trunk muscle mass (PIT: +2.2%, DT: -1.9%) than DT (p < 0.05). The fat
mass percentage showed a negative change from T1 to T2 in both groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PIT showed a trend toward better body composition (arm and trunk
muscle) and sport performances (10M sprint and aerobic capacity) compared to DT. 
This finding may provide information on the effectiveness of a personal isolation
training model for optimal preparation for taekwondo athletes and coaches. It may
also serve as a useful and safe guideline for training recommendations during the
coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
