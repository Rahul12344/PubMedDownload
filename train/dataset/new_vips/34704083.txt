Background: COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe. Critical to the control
of COVID-19 is the characterisation of its epidemiology. Despite this, there has 
been a paucity of evidence from many parts of the world, including Malaysia. We
aim to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malaysia to inform prevention and
control policies better.
Methods: Malaysian COVID-19 data was extracted from 16 March 2020 up to 31 May
2021. We estimated the following epidemiological indicators: 7-day incidence
rates, 7-day mortality rates, case fatality rates, test positive ratios, testing 
rates and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt).
Findings: Between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021, Malaysia has reported 571,901
cases and 2,796 deaths. Malaysia's average 7-day incidence rate was 26•6 reported
infections per 100,000 population (95% CI: 17•8, 38•1). The average test positive
ratio and testing rate were 4•3% (95% CI: 1•6, 10•2) and 0•8 tests per 1,000
population (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7), respectively. The case fatality rates (CFR) was
0•6% (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7). Among the 2,796 cases who died, 87•3% were ≥ 50 years.
Interpretation: The public health response was successful in the suppression of
COVID-19 transmission or the first half of 2020. However, a state election and
outbreaks in institutionalised populations have been the catalyst for more
significant community propagation. This rising community transmission has
continued in 2021, leading to increased incidence and strained healthcare
systems. Calibrating NPI based on epidemiological indicators remain critical for 
us to live with the virus. (243 words).

Strategies (CEASe) Project with funding from the Ministry of Science, Technology 
and Innovation (UM.0000245/HGA.GV).
