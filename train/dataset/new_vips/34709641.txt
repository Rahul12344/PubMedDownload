Several protocols for genomic amplification using reverse transcription followed 
by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), important in the identification of the
infecting serotype, have been used in the rapid diagnosis of Dengue Virus (DENV) 
infections. The qualitative protocol described by Lanciotti et al. (J Clin
Microbiol 30: 545-551, 1992) suggested by WHO detects the four DENV serotypes
simultaneously in one procedure "semi-nested," generating amplified products with
specific sizes in base pairs for each serotype and it has been the most used in
the past two decades. However, advances in molecular diagnosis have enabled the
development of RT-PCR in real time (qRT-PCR) based on the use of dyes and probes 
(SYBR green and TaqMan), which is performed in a single step and is capable of
providing quantitative data. In addition to quantification, the advantages of
qRT-PCR over conventional RT-PCR include speed, greater sensitivity and
specificity, and low rate of false positives. Several protocols for the diagnosis
and/or quantification of DENV have already been described. Non-PCR-based methods 
such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification have shown
high sensitivities and specificities. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR techniques can be
performed using serum, plasma, infected cells, mosquitoes, fresh, and
paraffin-embedded tissues. However, despite fast and accurate, they are limited
to samples collected during the acute phase of infection (up to 7 days after the 
onset of symptoms) and require specialized equipment and trained staff.
