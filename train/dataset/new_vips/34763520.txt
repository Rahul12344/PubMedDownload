Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is one of the most popular crops in Korea, with
over 100 million units produced annually. As watermelon cultivation increases,
the damage caused by plant viruses in watermelon farms is also increasing. In
July 2020, some watermelons cultivated on farms in Uiryeong showed typical viral 
symptoms, such as yellowing and necrosis. In previous studies, two plant viruses,
cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) and cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus
(CCYV), have been reported as causal agents of yellowing disease in the
cucurbitaceae plant in Korea. To identify the virus(es) associated with the
symptomatic watermelon plants, 11 samples were collected. Total RNA was extracted
from each sample using the Plant RNA Prep kit (Biocube System, Gwacheon, Korea). 
RT-PCR was performed using primer sets specific to CABYV and CCYV to detect each 
virus (Kwak et al. 2018, Wintermantel et al. 2019). CABYV was detected in one
sample, and CCYV was detected in 8 samples. Every sample presented similar
yellowing symptoms; however, neither virus was detected in the remaining two
samples. To investigate unknown viruses, a transcriptome library was constructed 
using total RNA of the watermelons and sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). The reads were de novo assembled and annotated using
the KEGG virus genome database with the NCBI BLAST utility. All procedures of
next generation sequencing were performed by Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Three large
viral contigs were identified, and additional BLAST analyses for nucleotides (nt)
and proteins indicated that they were CABYV, CCYV, and melon aphid-borne yellows 
virus (MAYBV). A total of 247,198 reads were mapped to reference MABYV sequence
(GenBank Accession Number NC_010809), and the sequencing depth was 6,575X. The
contig (MW505927) had a size of 5,677 nt and showed 100% coverage and 96%
identity with known complete MABYV sequences (JQ700307 and EU000534). To confirm 
the presence of MABYV, RT-PCR was performed using specific primer sets targeting 
MABYV (MABYV-262-F, 5'-GAACCGTCGACGCACTTCAAAGAGTA-3' and Polero-uni-R,
5'-GATYTTATAYTCATGGTAGGCCTTGAG-3'; Knierim et al. 2010). The expected size of 262
bp was obtained from 5 out of 11 samples, including the two samples mentioned
above. MABYV belongs to the genus Polerovirus and has been reported in cucurbit
crops in China, Taiwan, and Thailand (Xiang et al. 2008, Knierim et al. 2010,
Cheewachaiwit et al. 2017). According to the farmer, outbreak of aphids had
previously occurred and were controlled with pesticides. Since aphids are known
to be vectors of poleroviruses, we surmise that the watermelons were infected
with MABYV by the aphids at that time. To monitor the outbreak of MABYV,
watermelon farms in Uiryeong will be continuously investigated. To our knowledge,
this is the first report of MABYV in Korea.
