BACKGROUND: To investigate the predictive values of cytokeratin 18 for liver
fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: 252 HCV-infected patients with T2DM between January 2012 and August 2017
were retrospectively reviewed. Pearson/spearman correlation analysis was used to 
detect the correlation in the entire cohort. Multivariate linear regression was
used to identify independent predictors and logistic regression was for
establishing models. Combination models that incorporated CK18 and other methods 
(i.e. transient elastography, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index
(APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4)] were developed in a training cohort of 132
patients. Performance of models was evaluated through discrimination ability and 
clinical benefits. An internal validation was conducted in 120 consecutive
patients.
RESULTS: CK18 was found significantly associated with fibrosis scores (r = 0.452,
P < .001). CK18 and albumin were confirmed as independent predictors for
fibrosis. For predicting significant fibrosis in the validation cohort, the
observed AUC values of APRI + CK18 (AUC 0.83) and FIB-4 + CK18 (AUC 0.84) were
higher than those of APRI (AUC 0.61) and FIB-4 (AUC 0.65). For predicting
advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, the AUC values of FIB-4 + CK18 (AUC 0.74 and
0.77, respectively) were significantly higher than those of FIB-4 (AUC 0.61 of
both). Decision curve analysis confirmed the more clinical benefits can be
provided by being combined with CK18.
CONCLUSIONS: CK18 is an independent predictor of liver fibrosis for HCV-infected 
patients with T2DM. Noninvasive methods incorporate CK18 and other biomarker
indices can have better performance for diagnosing fibrosis and help clinical
decision-making.
