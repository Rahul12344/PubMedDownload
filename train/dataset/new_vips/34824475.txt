Transneuronal viruses are powerful tools for tracing neuronal circuits or
delivering genes to specific neurons in the brain. While there are multiple
retrograde viruses, few anterograde viruses are available. Further, available
anterograde viruses often have limitations such as retrograde transport, high
neuronal toxicity or weak signals. We developed an anterograde viral system based
on a live attenuated vaccine for yellow fever-YFV-17D. Replication- or
packaging-deficient mutants of YFV-17D can be reconstituted in the brain, leading
to efficient synapse-specific and anterograde-only transneuronal spreading, which
can be controlled to achieve either monosynaptic or polysynaptic tracing.
Moreover, inducible transient replication of YFV-17D mutant is sufficient to
induce permanent transneuronal genetic modifications without causing neuronal
toxicity. The engineered YFV-17D systems can be used to express fluorescent
markers, sensors or effectors in downstream neurons, thus providing versatile
tools for mapping and functionally controlling neuronal circuits.
