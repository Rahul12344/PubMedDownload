era.

BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, the concern about mask-harmful effects
disturbed mask-adherence. However, it is not certain whether the masks cause
cardiopulmonary overload.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the physiological and disturbing effects of surgical
face masks during exercise.
METHOD: The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital with 100 healthy
volunteers between September 2020 and January 2021. Individuals with impaired
walking, cardiopulmonary disease, and smoking were not included in the study.
Initially, respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2),
end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) were measured.  Participants underwent 6-minute 
walking test (6MWT) with and without surgical masks.  Mask-discomfort
questionnaire was applied before and after 6 MWT with the mask.
RESULTS: Surgical masks during 6 MWTs significantly increased HR, RR, and EtCO2
levels (p<0.001).  Walking distance (p<0.001) and SpO2 level (p=0.002) were
significantly decreased with mask. In Mask-Discomfort Questionnaire, humidity,
temperature, resistance, salinity, odor, fatigue (p<0.001), and itching (p=0.001)
scores significantly increased after 6MWT with mask.
CONCLUSION: In healthy volunteers, HR, RR, EtCO2 were increased, and SpO2 and
walking distance were decreased in the short-term, light exercise performed with 
the surgical mask. Findings support the concern that masks may cause
cardiopulmonary overload (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 17). Text in PDF www.elis.sk
