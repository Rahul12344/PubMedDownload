Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of COVID-19 disease. RT-qPCR has been the primary method of diagnosis;
however, the required infrastructure is lacking in many developing countries and 
the virus has remained a global challenge. More inexpensive and immediate test
methods are required to facilitate local, regional, and national management
strategies to re-open world economies. Here we have developed a SARS-CoV-2
antigen test in an inexpensive lateral flow format to generate a chromatographic 
result identifying the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, and thus an active
infection, within a patient anterior nares swab sample. Our 15-min test requires 
no equipment or laboratory infrastructure to administer with a limit of detection
of 2.0 × 102 TCID50/mL and 87.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity when tested
against 40 known positive and 40 known negative patient samples established by a 
validated RT-qPCR test.
