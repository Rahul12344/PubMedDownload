Narcissus (Narcissus tazetta) is a bulbous ornamental plant propagated
vegetatively from bulbs. The Cyrtanthus elatus virus-A (CyEV-A) had been reported
to cause a severe mosaic and yellow stripe disease in narcissus. Therefore, this 
study aimed to develop a protocol for the elimination of CyEV-A from infected
bulblets by in vitro chemotherapy (30-50 mg/L ribavirin for 30 days) and
electrotherapy (10-30 mA for 20 min), individually and in combination, to produce
virus-free plants. The regenerated plants obtained from these treatments were
screened for the absence of the CyEV-A by reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction assays using a set of degenerate primers specific for a potyvirus coat
protein gene. The results showed that in vitro chemotherapy (30 mg/L ribavirin
for 30 days) alone produced 46.0 % (14/30) of virus-free plants, while
electrotherapy (20 mA for 20 min) alone produced 40.0 % (12/30) of virus-free
plants. In comparison, a combination of chemotherapy (30 mg/L ribavirin for 30
days) and electrotherapy (20 mA for 20 min) produced 50.0 % (15/30) of virus-free
plants. The virus-free plants obtained from this combination treatment exhibited 
better growth and produced more bulbs compared to the other treatments and
control. The protocol may be used for the control of the virus disease in
narcissus.
