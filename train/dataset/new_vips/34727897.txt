BACKGROUND: The unexpected changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic related to the
fear of developing the disease, and the need for social distancing and isolation 
have had an effect on people's mental health. These drastic changes can result in
the development of anxiety, depressive symptoms and sense of loneliness. Elderly 
and chronically ill individuals are at a particularly high risk of developing
COVID-19, suffering severe illness and dying as a result of it.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety,
depressive symptoms, irritability and loneliness in the elderly aged 60 years and
older as a group exposed to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to 
analyze the relationships between loneliness and mental health of the respondents
and sociodemographic variables and chronic diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in Poland among 221 individuals
aged 60+. The study material was collected using a sociodemographic
questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-M) and a revised
University of California Los Angeles loneliness scale (R-UCLA). Women accounted
for 47.51% and men for 52.49% of study participants; the mean age was 65.18
(SD = 4.06).
RESULTS: In total, according to HADS-M, depressive symptoms were present in
19.15% of the participants and borderline states in 14.18% of them. Based on
R-UCLA, moderate and moderately high sense of loneliness was present in 58.83% of
the participants. Sense of loneliness was significantly correlated with the
prevalence of depressive symptoms (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, one in five participants experienced anxiety and
depressive symptoms. Two out of three participants experienced a moderate sense
of loneliness. Individuals who displayed a higher level of loneliness also had a 
higher severity of anxiety level depressive symptoms and irritability. Elderly
individuals should be under special care due to their high risk of experiencing
physical and mental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
