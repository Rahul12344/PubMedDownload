BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy occurring in the digestive
system and ranks second in cancer mortality worldwide. In colorectal cancer,
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is selectively upregulated, resulting in the further
exacerbation of the disease. Therefore, the clearance of H2S and the regulation
of the enzymes on the H2S pathways are of great significance for colorectal
cancer therapy.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the H2S content in various clinical tumor tissues 
from patients and confirmed that overproduced concentration of H2S in colorectal 
cancer. Accordingly, we developed an H2S-responsive nanoplatform based on zinc
oxide coated virus-like silica nanoparticles (VZnO) for the therapy of colorectal
cancer.
RESULTS: Owing to its excellent H2S scavenging ability, VZnO could effectively
reduce H2S content in colorectal cancer to prohibit the growth of CT26 and HCT116
colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the removal of H2S in colorectal cancer also
leads to tumor inhibition through activating ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of
cell death. The biosafety-related toxicological and pathological analysis
confirmed the low toxicity and high safety of VZnO in colorectal cancer
treatment. Furthermore, as an H2S-responsible nanosystem, VZnO appears to have no
therapeutic effect on other non H2S rich cancers, such as the 4T1 breast cancer
model.
CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the H2S-depletion-induced ferroptosis strategy
using zinc oxide-based nanomaterials would provide insights in designing
nanomedicines for colorectal cancer-target theranostics and may offer clinical
promise.
