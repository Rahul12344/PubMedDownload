BACKGROUND: The associations between vitamin D and coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) infection and clinical outcomes are controversial. The efficacy of
vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 is also not clear.
METHODS: We identified relevant cohort studies that assessed the relationship
between vitamin D, COVID-19 infection and associated death and randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) that reported vitamin D supplementation on the outcomes 
in patients with COVID-19 by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and medRxiv databases 
up to June 5th, 2021. Evidence quality levels and recommendations were assessed
using the GRADE system.
RESULTS: Eleven cohort studies with 536,105 patients and two RCTs were
identified. Vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficiency (< 30 ng/ml) was
not associated with an significant increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR for
< 20 ng/ml: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.92-2.80, I2 = 92%) or in-hospital death (OR for
< 20 ng/ml: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.91-5.26, I2 = 72%; OR for < 30 ng/ml: 3.07, 95% CI:
0.64-14.78, I2 = 66%). Each 10 ng/ml increase in serum vitamin D was not
associated with a significant decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 0.92, 95%
CI: 0.79-1.08, I2 = 98%) or death (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.40-1.06, I2 = 79%). The
overall quality of evidence (GRADE) for COVID-19 infection and associated death
was very low. Vitamin D supplements did not significantly decrease death (OR:
0.57, I2 = 64%) or ICU admission (OR: 0.14, I2 = 90%) in patients with COVID-19. 
The level of evidence as qualified using GRADE was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggested that vitamin D deficiency or
insufficiency was not significantly linked to susceptibility to COVID-19
infection or its associated death. Vitamin D supplements did not significantly
improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The overall GRADE evidence
quality was low, we suggest that vitamin D supplementation was not recommended
for patients with COVID-19.
