Reactive arthritis is an acute, sterile, non-suppurative and inflammatory
arthropathy that usually follows infection process. Gastrointestinal,
genitourinary and respiratory tract infections generally provoke reactive
arthritis. Also, reactive arthritis can be seen after vaccination. Reactive
arthritis cases have been reported after tetanus, combined
diphteria-poliomyelitis-tetanus toxoid, hepatitis B or influenza vaccination.
Although reactive arthritis is more common in youngs, healthcare workers should
be aware of the development of post inactivated COVID-19 vaccine reactive
arthritis in older patients. We present two cases with ReA induced by inactivated
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination (CoronaVac, Sinovac). Both patients in
our study were over 70 years old and presented with polyarthritis that developed 
after vaccination. Rheumatoid factor and anti-nucleer antibody were negative and 
patients responded well to short-term steroid therapy, arthritis were not
resistant.
