Reports conflict on how HIV infection influences the clinical course of COVID-19.
The New York City (NYC) public hospital system provides care for over 14,000
people with HIV, was central in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is
therefore in a unique position to evaluate the intersection of these concurrent
infections. Retrospective chart review of patients presenting to NYC Health and
Hospitals (NYC H+H) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from March 1, 2020, through
April 28, 2020, compared people living with HIV (PLWH) and a propensity-matched
(PM) control group of patients without HIV to evaluate associations between HIV
status and COVID-19 outcomes. Two hundred thirty-four PLWH presented for COVID-19
testing and 110 (47%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among 17,413 patients with
COVID-19 and without HIV, 1:n nearest neighbor propensity score matching
identified 194 patients matched on age, sex, race, and any comorbidity. In the
sample with COVID-19 (N = 304), PLWH (9.1%) had lower rates of mortality than
controls [19.1%; PM odds ratio (PM-OR): 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.19-0.86]. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 179), HIV infection was
associated with lower rates of mechanical ventilation (PM-OR: 0.31, 95% CI:
0.11-0.84) and mortality (PM-OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0. 17-0.95). In the extended
pandemic period through April 2021, aggregate data by HIV status suggested
elevated hospitalization and mortality rates in PLWH versus people without HIV.
These results suggest that the direct biological impacts of the HIV virus do not 
negatively influence COVID-19-related outcomes when controlling for comorbidity
and demographic variables.
