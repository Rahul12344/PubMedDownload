Objectives: In the past months, many countries have adopted varying degrees of
lockdown restrictions to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to
the existing literature, some consequences of lockdown restrictions on people's
lives are beginning to emerge yet the evolution of such consequences in relation 
to the time spent in lockdown is understudied. To inform policies involving
lockdown restrictions, this study adopted a data-driven Machine Learning approach
to uncover the short-term time-related effects of lockdown on people's physical
and mental health.
Study design: An online questionnaire was launched on 17 April 2020, distributed 
through convenience sampling and was self-completed by 2,276 people from 66
different countries.
Methods: Focusing on the UK sample (N = 325), 12 aggregated variables
representing the participant's living environment, physical and mental health
were used to train a RandomForest model to estimate the week of survey
completion.
Results: Using an index of importance, Self-Perceived Loneliness was identified
as the most influential variable for estimating the time spent in lockdown. A
significant U-shaped curve emerged for loneliness levels, with lower scores
reported by participants who took part in the study during the 6th lockdown week 
(p = 0.009). The same pattern was replicated in the Greek sample (N = 137) for
week 4 (p = 0.012) and 6 (p = 0.009) of lockdown.
Conclusions: From the trained Machine Learning model and the subsequent
statistical analysis, Self-Perceived Loneliness varied across time in lockdown in
the UK and Greek populations, with lower symptoms reported during the 4th and 6th
lockdown weeks. This supports the dissociation between social support and
loneliness, and suggests that social support strategies could be effective even
in times of social isolation.
