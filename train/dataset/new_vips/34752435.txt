ABSTRACT: The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) convened an
expert panel to address the current evidence, knowledge gaps, and recommendations
surrounding the COVID vaccination in athletes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The
group held a series of meetings beginning in July 2021 and reviewed the available
literature while using an iterative process and expert consensus to finalize this
guidance statement. This document is intended to provide clinicians with
suggestions on how to incorporate the COVID vaccination during the
preparticipation physical examination for athletes in all levels of training and 
competition. The statement is not intended to address treatment, infection
control principles, safety, ethical discussion, or public health issues related
to SARS-CoV-2. The AMSSM task force acknowledges the clinical uncertainty,
evolving public health objectives, and the limited data currently available to
create this guidance statement.
