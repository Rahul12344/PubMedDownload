Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first
discovered, there have been questions surrounding the effects of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), and more recently the COVID-19 vaccine, on men's health 
and fertility. Significant research has been conducted to study viral tropism,
potential causes for gender susceptibility, the impact of COVID-19 on male sexual
function in the acute and recovery phases, and the effects of the virus on male
reproductive organs and hormones. This review provides a recent assessment of the
literature regarding the impact of COVID-19 and its vaccine on male sexual health
and reproduction.
