BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
B.1.1.33-derived lineage named N.9 was described recently in Brazil and it's
considered a potential variant of interest (VOI) due to the presence of E484K
substitution at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the first detection of variant N.9 in Rio de Janeiro
State.
METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 N.9 was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis.
FINDINGS: Here, we report two SARS-CoV-2 N.9 lineage strains in Rio de Janeiro.
One of them had only the E484K substitution of the six N.9 lineage-defining
mutations. Other three strains pre-defined as N.9 have the same genomic profile. 
These four strains are grouped within the B.1.1.33 lineage and basal to the N.9
lineage in our phylogenetic analysis, and we call them "N.9-like/B.1.1.33 +
E484K".
MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic analysis shows four independent introductions 
of N.9 in the state of Rio de Janeiro in October and December 2020, January and
March 2021. SARS-CoV-2 N.9 dissemination in the Rio de Janeiro could have been
limited by the emergence and dominance of other variants, mainly by the lineage
P.2 VOI Zeta that emerged in the same period and co-circulated with N.9, as
observed in the neighboring State of São Paulo.
