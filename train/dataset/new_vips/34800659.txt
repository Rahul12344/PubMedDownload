PURPOSE: We describe the design of a longitudinal cohort study to determine
SARS-CoV-2 incidence and prevalence among a population-based sample of adults
living in six San Francisco Bay Area counties.
METHODS: Using an address-based sample, we stratified households by county and by
census-tract risk. Risk strata were determined by using regression models to
predict infections by geographic area using census-level sociodemographic and
health characteristics. We disproportionately sampled high and medium risk
strata, which had smaller population sizes, to improve precision of estimates,
and calculated a desired sample size of 3400. Participants were primarily
recruited by mail and were followed monthly with PCR testing of nasopharyngeal
swabs, testing of venous blood samples for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and
nucleocapsid antigens, and testing of the presence of neutralizing antibodies,
with completion of questionnaires about socio-demographics and behavior.
Estimates of incidence and prevalence will be weighted by county, risk strata and
sociodemographic characteristics of non-responders, and will take into account
laboratory test performance.
RESULTS: We enrolled 3842 adults from August to December, 2020, and completed
follow-up March 31, 2021. We reached target sample sizes within most strata.
CONCLUSIONS: Our stratified random sampling design will allow us to recruit a
robust general population cohort of adults to determine the incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Identifying risk strata was unique to the design and will
help ensure precise estimates, and high-performance testing for presence of virus
and antibodies will enable accurate ascertainment of infections.
