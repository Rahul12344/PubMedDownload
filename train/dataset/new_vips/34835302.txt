African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses serious threats to the swine industry. The
mortality rate of African swine fever (ASF) is 100%, and there is no effective
vaccine currently available. Complex immune escape strategies of ASFV are crucial
factors affecting immune prevention and vaccine development. CD2v and MGF360-505R
genes have been implicated in the modulation of the immune response. The
molecular mechanisms contributing to innate immunity are poorly understood. In
this study, we discover the cytopathic effect and apoptosis of
ΔCD2v/ΔMGF360-505R-ASFV after infection in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs)
was significantly less than wild-type ASFV. We demonstrated that CD2v- and
MGF360-505R-deficient ASFV decrease the level of apoptosis by inhibiting the
NF-κB signaling pathway and IL-1β mRNA transcription. Compared with wild-type
ASFV infection, the levels of phospho-NF-κB p65 and p-IκB protein decreased in
CD2v- and MGF360-505R-deficient ASFV. Moreover, CD2v- and MGF360-505R-deficient
ASFV induced less IL-1β production than wild-type ASFV and was attenuated in
replication compared with wild-type ASFV. We further found that MGF360-12L,
MGF360-13L, and MGF-505-2R suppress the promoter activity of NF-κB by reporter
assays, and CD2v activates the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings suggested 
that CD2v- and MGF360-505R-deficient ASFV could reduce the level of ASFV p30 and 
the apoptosis of PAMs by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and IL-1β mRNA
transcription, which might reveal a novel strategy for ASFV to maintain the
replication of the virus in the host.
