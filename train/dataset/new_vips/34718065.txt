BACKGROUND: The use of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs as a specimen collection method 
to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently perceived as uncomfortable by
patients and requires trained personnel. In this study, detection rate of
SARS-CoV-2 in mouthwash samples and buccal swabs were compared in both children
and adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19
within the previous 72 hours, NP and buccal swabs as well as mouthwash samples
were collected. RT-qPCR was performed on all samples.
RESULTS: In total, 170 samples were collected from 155 patients (137 adults and
18 children). Approximately 91.7% of the collected NP swabs were positive in
RT-PCR compared to 63.1% of mouthwash samples and 42.4% of buccal swabs. Compared
to NP swabs, the sensitivity of using mouthwash was 96.3% and 65.4% for buccal
swabs in NP swab samples with a CT value <25. With increasing CT values,
sensitivity decreased in both mouthwash and buccal swabs. The virus load was
highest during the first week of infection, with a continuous decline observed in
all three collection methods over time.
DISCUSSION: Mouthwash presents an alternative collection method for detecting
SARS-CoV-2 in the case of unfeasible NP swab sampling. Buccal swabs should not be
used due to their low sensitivity.
