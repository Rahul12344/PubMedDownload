BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is capable of
human-to-human transmission and rapid global spread. Thus, the establishment of
high-quality viral detection and quantification methods, and the development of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents are critical.
METHODS: Here, we present the rapid detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles 
using a plaque assay with 0.5% agarose-ME (Medium Electroosmosis) as an overlay
medium.
RESULTS: The plaques were capable of detecting the virus within 36-40 h
post-infection. In addition, we showed that a monogalactosyl diacylglyceride
isolated from a microalga (Coccomyxa sp. KJ) could inactivate the clinical
isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: These results would allow rapid quantification of the infectious
virus titers and help develop more potent virucidal agents against SARS-CoV-2.
