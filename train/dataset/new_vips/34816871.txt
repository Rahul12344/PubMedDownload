OBJECTIVE: to verify the quality of life and eating habits of patients with
obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: cross-sectional study with 68 outpatients, candidates for bariatric
surgery, at university hospital in the Southern Brazil. Data collection was
carried out by telephone, with questions about the profile of the participants
and social distancing; questionnaires on quality of life and eating habits were
also used. The data analysis, the logistic regression model, Spearman
correlation, Mann-Whitney U and Student t-tests were used for independent
samples.
RESULTS: the general quality of life was 57.03 points and the eating habit with
the highest score was cognitive restraint (61.11 points). Most patients (72.1%)
were socially distancing themselves and 27.9% had not changed their routine. The 
chance of isolation was 3.16 times greater for patients who were married. There
is a positive correlation between the domains of the Quality of Life
questionnaire and cognitive restraint from the questionnaire about eating habits.
CONCLUSION: we found that the participants tended to have a better quality of
life as cognitive restraint increased.
