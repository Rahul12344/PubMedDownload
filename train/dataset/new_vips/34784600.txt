The COVID-19 pandemic has upset habits in any workplace. In hospitals, several
precautions have been taken to maintain health-care workers' safety and to avoid 
disease spread or the possible creation of new epidemic outbreaks. The use of
medical devices makes the contamination and the nosocomial virus spread possible,
causing infection in medical operators and hospitalized patients. In the neonatal
intensive care unit, ultrasound has been an increasingly used tool because it is 
a non-invasive, repeatable method and it is side effect-free as the newborn is
not exposed to radiation. It makes a fast diagnosis and then therapy possible
such as in the lung diseases and other life-threatening conditions. The use of
portable devices such as the wireless probe has many advantages in routine
clinical practice, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has proved to be
fundamental for the patient and the physician's safety because it reduced the
risk of contamination. We report the use of the wireless ultrasound probe in 2
isolated neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers.
