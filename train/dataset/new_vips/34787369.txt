BACKGROUND: Children with comorbidities are at greater risk of severe influenza
outcomes compared with healthy children. In Australia, influenza vaccination was 
funded for those with comorbidities from 2010 and all children aged <5 years from
2018. Influenza vaccine coverage remains inadequate in children with and without 
comorbidities.
METHODS: Children ≤16 years admitted with acute respiratory illness and tested
for influenza at sentinel hospitals were evaluated (2010-2019). Multivariable
regression was used to identify predictors of severe outcomes. Vaccine
effectiveness was estimated using the modified incidence density test-negative
design.
RESULTS: Overall, 6057 influenza-confirmed hospitalized cases and 3974
test-negative controls were included. Influenza A was the predominant type
(68.7%). Comorbidities were present in 40.8% of cases. Children with
comorbidities were at increased odds of ICU admission, respiratory support,
longer hospitalizations, and mortality. Specific comorbidities including
neurological and cardiac conditions increasingly predisposed children to severe
outcomes. Influenza vaccine coverage in influenza negative children with and
without comorbidities was low (33.5% and 17.9%, respectively). Coverage improved 
following introduction of universal influenza vaccine programs for children
<5 years. Similar vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated in children with (55%
[95% confidence interval (CI): 45; 63%]) and without comorbidities (57% [(95%CI: 
44; 67%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities were present in 40.8% of influenza-confirmed
admissions and were associated with more severe outcomes. Children with
comorbidities were more likely experience severe influenza with ICU admission,
mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital morality. Despite demonstrated vaccine
effectiveness in those with and without comorbidities, vaccine coverage was
suboptimal. Interventions to increase vaccination are expected to reduce severe
influenza outcomes.
