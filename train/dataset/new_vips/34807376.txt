BACKGROUND: Small non-coding RNAs have emerged as essential modulators of viral
infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Cellular miRNAs directly regulate the
viral infectivity and indirectly by targeting virus-host factors. The current
study investigates the inhibitory effect of let-7b miRNA on HCV replication in
the Hepatocarcinoma cell line (Huh7.5).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The algorithm-based search revealed that let-7b, a high
score microRNA, has target sequences on the HCV genome. The Huh7.5 cells were
stably transduced with let-7b lentiviral vectors (Huh7.5/let-7b) and mock
(Huh7.5/scrambled). The expression of the let-7b level was assessed by real-time 
PCR assay and Red fluorescence microscope. A dual-luciferase assay was conducted 
to evaluate the liver-specific let-7b and HCV genome interaction. In the next
step, for establishing HCVcc, Full-length HCV-RNA was transduced to naïve Huh7.5,
Huh7.5/scrambled, and Huh7.5/let-7b cells. The results of in silico analysis and 
dual-luciferase reporter assay exhibited a specific interaction of HCV-NS5B and
let-7b. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that in contrast to infected naïve Huh7.5
cells and Huh7.5/scrambled, a significant decrease in HCV-RNA load was seen in
Huh7.5/let-7b cells. On the other hand, the Flow Cytometry test showed that
let-7b could significantly induce the apoptosis pathway in Huh7.5/let-7b.
CONCLUSIONS: The results also suggest that let-7b, as a target of the HCV genome,
potentially reduces HCV replication and raises cell apoptosis rate. We suggest
that let-7b directly downregulates HCV replication and may serve as a unique
antiviral therapy.
