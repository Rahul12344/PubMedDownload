BACKGROUND: The provision of healthcare during the pandemic caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus represented a challenge for the management of the resources in
the primary care centres. We proposed assessing burnout among the staff of those 
centres and identifying factors that contributed to its appearance and those that
limited it.
METHODS: An observational study which, by means of anonymous questionnaires,
collected information about: (i) demographic variables; (ii) the characteristics 
of each position; (iii) the measures implemented by the medical decision-makers
in order to provide care during the pandemic; and (iv) the Burnout Clinical
Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ-36). We performed a descriptive analysis of the
burnout mentioned by the staff, and, by means of a multivariate analysis, we
identified the factors which influenced it. Using logit models, we analysed
whether receiving specific training in COVID-19, feeling involved in
decision-making processes, and/or working within different healthcare systems had
effects on the development of burnout.
RESULTS: We analysed the replies of 252 employees of primary care centres in
Spain with an average age of 45 (SD = 15.7) and 22 (SD = 11.4) years of
experience. 68% of the participants (n = 173) indicated burnout of the frenetic
subtype. 79% (n = 200) of the employees had high scores in at least one burnout
subtype, and 62% (n = 156) in at least two. Women older than 45 had a lower
probability of suffering burnout. Receiving specific training (OR = 0.28; CI95%: 
0.11-0.73) and feeling involved in decision-making (OR = 0.32; CI95%:0.15-0.70)
each reduced the probability of developing burnout. Working in a different
department increased the likelihood of developing burnout of at least one
clinical subtype (OR = 2.85; CI95%: 1.38-5.86).
CONCLUSIONS: The staff in primary care centres have developed high levels of
burnout. Participation in decision-making and receiving specific training are
revealed as factors that protect against the development of burnout. The measures
taken to contain the adverse effects of a heavy workload appear to be
insufficient. Certain factors that were not observed, but which are related to
decisions taken by the healthcare management, appear to have had an effect on the
development of some burnout subtypes.
