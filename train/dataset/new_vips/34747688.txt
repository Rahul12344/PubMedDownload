Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic virus, has two life 
cycle modes: the latent and lytic phases. KSHV lytic reactivation is important
for both viral propagation and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis. The KSHV replication
and transcription activator (RTA) protein is essential for lytic reactivation.
Hesperetin, a citrus polyphenolic flavonoid, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
hypolipidemic, cardiovascular and anti-tumour effects. However, the effects of
hesperetin on KSHV replication and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis have not yet been
reported. Here, we report that hesperetin induces apoptotic cell death in BCBL-1 
cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hesperetin inhibits KSHV reactivation and
reduces the production of progeny virus from KSHV-harbouring cells. We also
confirmed that HIF1α promotes the RTA transcriptional activities and lytic
cycle-refractory state of KSHV-infected cells. Hesperetin suppresses HIF1α
expression to inhibit KSHV lytic reactivation. These results suggest that
hesperetin may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of KSHV infection and
KSHV-associated lymphomas.
