Paramyxoviruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, pose a critical
threat to human public health. Currently, 78 species, 17 genera, and 4
subfamilies of paramyxoviruses are harbored by multiple natural reservoirs,
including rodents, bats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Henipaviruses are critical
zoonotic pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory distress and neurological 
diseases in humans. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 115
Crocidura species individuals were examined for the prevalence of paramyxovirus
infections. Paramyxovirus RNA was observed in 26 (22.6%) shrews collected at five
trapping sites, Republic of Korea. Herein, we report two genetically distinct
novel paramyxoviruses (genus: Henipavirus): Gamak virus (GAKV) and Daeryong virus
(DARV) isolated from C. lasiura and C. shantungensis, respectively. Two GAKVs and
one DARV were nearly completely sequenced using next-generation sequencing. GAKV 
and DARV contain six genes (3'-N-P-M-F-G-L-5') with genome sizes of 18,460
nucleotides and 19,471 nucleotides, respectively. The phylogenetic inference
demonstrated that GAKV and DARV form independent genetic lineages of Henipavirus 
in Crocidura species. GAKV-infected human lung epithelial cells elicited the
induction of type I/III interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and
proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, this study contributes further
understandings of the molecular prevalence, genetic characteristics and
diversity, and zoonotic potential of novel paramyxoviruses in shrews.
