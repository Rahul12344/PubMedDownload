INTRODUCTION: Although the COVID-19 vaccination is deemed safe, exact incidence
and nature if adverse effects, particularly dermatological ones, are still
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic, clinical, morphological characteristics, 
outcomes, and timing of development of herpes zoster to the various COVID-19
vaccines. And to identify on whether COVID-19 vaccine has temporal relationship
between development of herpes zoster (HZ).
METHODS: We have performed a systemic review of articles from PubMed and Embase
using MeSH and keywords like "Shingles," "Herpes zoster," "Varicella zoster,"
"COVID-19," "Vaccine," "SARS-CoV-2." No filters including country of publication,
language, type of articles were applied. Individual case report references were
filtered for any pertinent cases.
RESULTS: A total of 54 cases consisting of 27 male and 27 female patients have
been reported. There were cases with known risk factors for herpes zoster, which 
included age more than 50 years (n = 36), immunological disorders (n = 10),
chronic disease (n = 25), metabolic disorder (n = 13), malignancy (n = 4), and
psychiatric disorder (n = 2). The mean (SD) period between development of herpes 
zoster and COVID-19 vaccination was 7.64 (6.92) days. Majority of the cases were 
from the high-income and/or middle-income countries. 86.27% of the cases of HZ
were reported due to mRNA vaccine. Thirty-six patients 36/45 (80%) developed
herpes zoster following the priming dose of COVID-19 vaccine among those who
received mRNA vaccine.
CONCLUSION: We could not establish definite link but there may be possible
association between COVID-19 vaccine and shingles. Large-scale studies may help
to understand the cause-effect relationship.
