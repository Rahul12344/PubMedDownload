Introduction: The morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference has long been a part
of the education of residents of all specialties in the United States, yet its
structure is variable across training programs. Recent literature has described
the use of M&M as a forum for education in quality improvement methodology;
however, a structure focusing on education in cognitive biases and errors has not
been previously described in MedEdPORTAL.
Methods: This structured M&M conference series called upon resident presenters
and peers in the audience to examine cognitive biases and errors involved in
specific patient cases. Associated materials included preparatory guidelines
provided to faculty advisors and resident presenters, a presentation template
used during the introductory session, and a handout used during the discussion
portions of presentations.
Results: During the 2019-2020 academic year, a total of 24 PGY 2 pediatrics
residents presented M&M cases. They identified a mean of 3.7 (SD = 1.9) cognitive
biases and/or errors per case and a mean of 1.7 (SD = 0.7) debiasing strategies
per case. Peers in the audience were also successful in identifying potential
biases and errors at play during presentations.
Discussion: We found that through this M&M conference structure, residents were
able to demonstrate the ability to identify cognitive errors and biases both
within themselves and in peers. This provided an effective forum for the
identification and discussion of debiasing strategies, even when the series was
forced to transition to a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
