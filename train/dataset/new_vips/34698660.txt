BACKGROUND: The determination of the rate of social distancing compliance and
mask-wearing adherence is essential to address the health aspects of COVID-19.
The present study aimed to estimate the adherence to mask-wearing and maintaining
the social distancing in public places in Hamadan, western Iran, during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
STUDY DESIGN: The present study was conducted based on a cross-sectional design.
METHODS: The current study included 72 images from 12 areas in Hamadan as
clusters in January 2021. The images were extracted from the traffic control
center of Hamadan Municipality. The mean of social distancing and percentage of
mask-wearing in all clusters were obtained based on cluster sampling.
RESULTS: In this research, the majority of people(68%) of people in public places
were men and 32% women. The mean±SD of social distancing in all public places in 
Hamadan was obtained at 65.27 ±73.37 cm (95% CI: 38.48-92.08). The percentage of 
men who wore masks correctly was higher than that of women (57% vs. 51%).
Moreover, mask-wearing adherence was not recognizable in about 34% of people in
the images (28% of men versus 48% of women). Among the people whose images were
recognizable, all the women were wearing masks, while about 13% of men were not
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the mean social distance in
Hamadan was much lower than the standard value (1.5-2 meters) even at the time of
restrictions. Although more than half of people wore masks in public places, it
was much less than that in developed countries. Therefore, people should pay more
attention to health advice regarding mask-wearing and maintaining social
distance.
