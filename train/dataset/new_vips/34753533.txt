BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting
measures can impact daily life and healthcare management amongst patients with
beta thalassemia major.
METHODS: The Corbin and Strauss method of grounded theory was used to explore the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst
Iranian patients with beta thalassemia major. Semi-structured interviews with 16 
patients with thalassemia major in the eastern of Iran were performed. Data
collection was conducted from 19 September through 18 November 2020. Collected
data were recorded, transcribed, and coded to develop themes and subthemes.
Paradigm components were sought to find out what happened to these patients and
explore the process and events.
RESULTS: Insights from these interviews led to five major themes: 'changing
physical health', 'emotional and psychological reactions', 'changing the nature
of relationships and the scope of social support', 'metamorphosis of ongoing
healthcare, and 'functionality and adaptation to new realities.' The emerging
core concept was labelled: 'maintaining well-being balance.' The COVID-19
pandemic disturbed the balance of life and health of the patients. Multiple
strategies to maintain balance and reduce the negative effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on HRQoL were used by the patients, the healthcare team, and support
systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the fear of COVID-19, the patients with beta thalassemia were
less likely to contact healthcare professionals. They considered postponing blood
transfusion and abandoned evaluating disease complications. Reduced access to the
healthcare system and shifting resources from existing programmes to COVID-19 by 
the healthcare system were incompatible policies. These policies and strategies
had strong and negative effects on the physical domain of HRQoL. The patients
experienced a deterioration of emotional functioning. They reported a strong
reduction in social functioning and felt lonely. Online interventions supporting 
mental health and social interactions and telemedicine can help during the times 
of social distancing and lockdowns.
