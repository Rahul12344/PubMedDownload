OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prospectively describe the incidence and clinical
spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised paediatric patients in the 
UK.
METHODS: From March 2020 to 2021 weekly questionnaires were sent to
immunocompromised paediatric patients or their parents. Information, including
symptom presentation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results, was collected from 1527
participants from 46 hospitals. Cross-sectional serology was investigated in
February and March 2021.
RESULTS: Until the end of September 2020, no cases were reported. From September 
28th 2020 to March 2021 a total of 38 PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infections were
reported. Of these, four children were admitted to hospital but none had acute
severe COVID-19. Increasing age in association with immunodeficiency increased
reporting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Worsening of fever, cough, and sore throat
were associated with participants reporting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology data
included 452 unvaccinated participants. In those reporting prior positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were detectable antibodies in 9 of 18 (50%). In those with 
no prior report of infection, antibodies were detected in 32 of 434 (7•4%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred in
immunocompromised children and young people with no increased risk of severe
disease. No children died.
