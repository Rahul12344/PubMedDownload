We describe a 56-year-old female patient hospitalised with COVID-19 in April 2020
who had persistent respiratory symptoms after radiographic and microbiologic
recovery. X-ray of the chest demonstrated an elevated right hemidiaphragm while
fluoroscopy confirmed unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Symptoms resolved
gradually, concurrent with restoration of right hemidiaphragm function. Thus, we 
describe a rare cause of postacute sequelae of COVID-19 dyspnoea.
