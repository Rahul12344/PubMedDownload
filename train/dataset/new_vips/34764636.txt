Anthraquinones (AQs) are found in a variety of consumer products, including
foods, nutritional supplements, drugs, and traditional medicines, and have a wide
range of pharmacological actions. Rubiadin, a 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methyl
anthraquinone, primarily originates from Rubia cordifolia Linn (Rubiaceae). It
was first discovered in 1981 and has been reported for many biological
activities. However, no review has been reported so far to create awareness about
this molecule and its role in future drug discovery. Therefore, the present
review aimed to provide comprehensive evidence of Rubiadin's phytochemistry,
biosynthesis, physicochemical properties, biological properties and therapeutic
potential. Relevant literature was gathered from numerous scientific databases
including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar between 1981 and
up-to-date. The distribution of Rubiadin in numerous medicinal plants, as well as
its method of isolation, synthesis, characterisation, physiochemical properties
and possible biosynthesis pathways, was extensively covered in this review.
Following a rigorous screening and tabulating, a thorough description of
Rubiadin's biological properties was gathered, which were based on scientific
evidences. Rubiadin fits all five of Lipinski's rule for drug-likeness
properties. Then, the in depth physiochemical characteristics of Rubiadin were
investigated. The simple technique for Rubiadin's isolation from R. cordifolia
and the procedure of synthesis was described. Rubiadin is also biosynthesized via
the polyketide and chorismate/o-succinylbenzoic acid pathways. Rubiadin is a
powerful molecule with anticancer, antiosteoporotic, hepatoprotective,
neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antibacterial,
antimalarial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. The mechanism of action for
the majority of the pharmacological actions reported, however, is unknown. In
addition to this review, an in silico molecular docking study was performed
against proteins with PDB IDs: 3AOX, 6OLX, 6OSP, and 6SDC to support the
anticancer properties of Rubiadin. The toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics and
possible structural modifications were also described. Rubiadin was also proven
to have the highest binding affinity to the targeted proteins in an in silico
study; thus, we believe it may be a potential anticancer molecule. In order to
present Rubiadin as a novel candidate for future therapeutic development,
advanced studies on preclinical, clinical trials, bioavailability, permeability
and administration of safe doses are necessary.
