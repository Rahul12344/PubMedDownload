Rabbit hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been detected among rabbits and recently
isolated from immunocompromised patients, suggesting zoonotic transmission. In
this study, HEV infection among feral rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was
assessed by detection of anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. The prevalence of
anti-HEV antibodies in sera was of 33 % (20/60) and HEV RNA was detected from
only one of fecal swabs (1.7 %, 1/58). Furthermore, one naïve rabbit was
intravenously inoculated with the suspension of the HEV-positive fecal specimen, 
exhibiting persistent HEV shedding in feces, intermittent viremia, seroconversion
to anti-HEV IgM and IgG, and high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values,
indicating persistent HEV infection. The isolate JP-59 had a length of 7,282 bp
excluding a poly (A) tail and possessed the characteristic 93 bp-insertion in
ORF1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that JP-59 formed a cluster with other
rabbit HEV isolates from rabbits and human origin. The JP-59 shared the
nucleotide sequence identities less than 87 % with other rabbit HEVs, suggesting 
that a novel rabbit HEV strain was circulating in Japan.
