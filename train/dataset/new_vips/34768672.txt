BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Chronic humoral immune response against multiple microbial 
antigens may play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). We aimed to assess the prevalence and magnitude of antibody response
against various bacterial and viral immunogen peptides in the sera of RA patients
compared with the general population.
METHODS: Polyclonal IgG antibodies (Abs) specific for peptides derived from
Porphyromonas gingivalis (RgpA, Kpg), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
(LtxA1, LtxA2), Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP4027),
Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1, EBVBOLF), and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W
env-su) were detected by ELISA in serum samples from 148 consecutive RA patients 
and 148 sex and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). In addition, the presence of 
a relationship between the positivity and the titer of antibodies and RA
descriptors was explored by bivariate correlation analysis.
RESULTS: RA patients exhibit a higher prevalence of humoral immune response
against all tested peptides compared to HCs with a statically significant
difference for MAP4027 (30.4% vs. 10.1%), BOLF (25.7% vs. 8.1%), RgpA (24.3% vs. 
9.4%), HERV W-env (20.3% vs. 9.4%), and EBNA1 (18.9% vs. 9.4%) peptides.
Fifty-three (35.8%) out of 148 RA serum and 93 (62.8%) out of 148 HCs were
negative for all pathogen-derived peptides. There was a significant correlation
between OD values obtained by ELISA test against all peptides (p < 0.0001). We
also found an increased titer and prevalence of Abs against LtxA1 and LtxA2 in
seropositive vs. seronegative RF (p = 0.019, p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significantly increased humoral response
against multiple pathogens in patients with RA and implies that they could be an 
important factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, the role of each 
individual pathogen in RA needs to be further investigated.
