We describe a step-by-step protocol for the computation of absolute dissociation 
free energy with GROMACS code and PLUMED library, which exploits a combination of
advanced sampling techniques and nonequilibrium alchemical methodologies. The
computational protocol has been automated through an open source Python
middleware (HPC_Drug) which allows one to set up the GROMACS/PLUMED input files
for execution on high performing computing facilities. The proposed protocol, by 
exploiting its inherent parallelism and the power of the GROMACS code on
graphical processing units, has the potential to afford accurate and precise
estimates of the dissociation constants in drug-receptor systems described at the
atomistic level. The procedure has been applied to the calculation of the
absolute dissociation free energy of PF-07321332, an oral antiviral proposed by
Pfizer, with the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2.
