Background & Aims: Currently available HDV PCR assays are characterized by
considerable run-to-run and inter-laboratory variability. Hence, we established a
quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay on the open
channel of a fully automated PCR platform (cobas6800, Roche) offering improved
consistency and reliability.
Methods: A primer/probe-set targeting a highly conserved region upstream of the
HDV antigen was adapted for use on the cobas6800. The lower limit of detection
(LLOD) was determined using a dilution panel of the HDV WHO standard (n =
21/dilution). Linearity and inclusivity were tested by preparing 10-fold dilution
series of cell culture-derived virus (genotype [GT]1-8; n = 5/dilution). Patient 
samples containing a variety of bloodborne viral pathogens were tested to confirm
exclusivity (n = 60).
Results: The LLOD of the HDV utility-channel (HDV_UTC) assay was determined as
3.86 IU/ml (95% CI 2.95-5.05 IU/ml) with a linear range from 10-10ˆ8 IU/ml (GT1).
Linear relationships were observed for all HDV GTs with slopes ranging from
-3.481 to -4.134 cycles/log and R2 from 0.918 to 0.994. Inter-run and intra-run
variability were 0.3 and 0.6 Ct (3xLLOD), respectively. No false-positive results
were observed. To evaluate clinical performance, 110 serum samples of
anti-HDV-Ab+ patients were analyzed using the HDV_UTC and CE-IVD RoboGene assays.
58/110 and 49/110 samples were concordant positive or negative, respectively
(overall agreement 97.3%). Quantitative comparison demonstrated a strong
correlation (R2 0.8733; 95% CI 0.8914-0.9609; p value <0.0001).
Conclusion: The use of highly automated, sample-to-result solutions for molecular
diagnostics holds many inherent benefits over manual workflows, including
improved reliability, reproducibility and dynamic scaling of testing capacity.
The assay we established showed excellent analytical and clinical performance,
with inclusivity for all HDV GTs and a limit of quantification of 10 IU/ml,
making it a sensitive new tool for HDV screening and viral load monitoring.
Lay summary: The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes a severe form of inflammation
in the liver. We developed a tool for molecular diagnostics, a polymerase chain
reaction HDV assay that showed great performance. It can be used to improve
diagnosis of HDV, as well as for monitoring treatment responses. The assay allows
for quantification of the virus in the tested samples and is performed on a fully
automated platform (cobas6800), which provides various benefits including less
hands-on time and excellent comparability of test results.
