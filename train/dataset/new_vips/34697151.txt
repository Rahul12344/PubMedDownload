BACKGROUND/AIM: Sperm cells are competent to integrate exogenous DNA into their
genome. We sought to clarify Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) internalization in
spermatozoa and early preimplantation embryos.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sperm was incubated with plasmid vectors containing the
complete genome of human HPV 16 and HPV 18 tagged with the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) gene, to investigate HPV 16 and HPV 18 integration in mouse
spermatozoa. Oocytes were in vitro fertilized with preincubated spermatozoa to
investigate HPV 16 and HPV 18 potential transfer to mouse embryos.
RESULTS: Spermatozoa were able to internalize constructs of cloned high-risk HPV 
either as integrated or as episomal DNA. Constructs of cloned HPV can also be
transferred to mouse embryos, through in vitro fertilization of the oocytes by
mouse spermatozoa.
CONCLUSION: Viral DNA transmission to the early mouse embryo via sperm,
highlights the effect of HPV in reproductive cells and preimplantation
development.
