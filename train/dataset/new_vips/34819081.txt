BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic shows the presence of
health disparities, especially in terms of morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association of racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic status (SES) with health outcomes and access to healthcare
services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We retrieved published evidence from late December 2019 through March 1,
2021. The target population was the population of the countries during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The exposures were defined as belonging to racial/ethnic
minority groups and/or low SES. The primary outcomes of interest include (1)
death from COVID-19, (2) COVID-19 incidence/infection, (3) COVID-19
hospitalization, (4) ICU admission, (5) need for mechanical ventilation, (6)
confirmed diagnosis, and (7) access to testing. We systematically synthesized the
findings from different studies and provided a narrative explanation of the
results.
RESULTS: After removing the duplicate results and screening for relevant titles
and abstracts, 77 studies were selected for full-text review. Finally, 52 studies
were included in the review. The majority of the studies were from the United
States (37 studies). Despite the significant incongruity among the studies, most 
of them showed that racial/ethnic minority groups had higher risks of COVID-19
infection and hospitalization, confirmed diagnosis, and death. Additionally, most
of the studies cited factors such as low level of education, poverty, poor
housing conditions, low household income, speaking in a language other than the
national language in a country, and living in overcrowded households as risk
factors of COVID-19 incidence/infection, death, and confirmed diagnosis. However,
findings in terms of the association of lack of health insurance coverage and
unemployment with the outcome measures as well as the association of requiring
mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and access to testing for COVID-19 with
race/ethnicity were limited and inconsistent.
CONCLUSION: It is evident that racial/ethnic minority groups and those from low
SES are more vulnerable to COVID-19; therefore, public health policymakers,
practitioners, and clinicians should be aware of these inequalities and strive to
narrow the gap by focusing on vulnerable populations. This systematic review also
revealed a major incongruity in the definition of the racial/ethnic minority
groups and SES among the studies.
