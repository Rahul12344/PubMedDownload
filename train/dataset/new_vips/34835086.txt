Edible insects are expected to become an important nutrient source for animals
and humans in the Western world in the near future. Only a few studies on viruses
in edible insects with potential for industrial rearing have been published and
concern only some edible insect species. Viral pathogens that can infect insects 
could be non-pathogenic, or pathogenic to the insects themselves, or to humans
and animals. The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of
the viruses detected in edible insects currently considered for use in food
and/or feed in the European Union or appropriate for mass rearing, and to collect
information on clinical symptoms in insects and on the vector role of insects
themselves. Many different virus species have been detected in edible insect
species showing promise for mass production systems. These viruses could be a
risk for mass insect rearing systems causing acute high mortality, a drastic
decline in growth in juvenile stages and in the reproductive performance of
adults. Furthermore, some viruses could pose a risk to human and animal health
where insects are used for food and feed.
